The place really surprised me... initially I was worried of that 'eating in a shopping mall' feel. The contemporary decor is easy on the eye, chairs super comfy for your bum and food the tasty perfection for your tongue. After the meal go and digest in their stunning bar next door- I do recommend the wine/beer, but I found the cocktails to be very average.",

    "text": "I was skeptical about heading to an Indian restaurant for breakfast, but I am always willing to try something new. I was impressed even before sampling the food. CK is located in Devonshire Square, which I didn't know even existed. The restaurant is located within a covered atrium in the square and there is lovely outside seating sheltered from the rain. The Gherkin imposingly watches over diners. Would love to see what it looks like in the evening. The food was fantastic from the preparation, to presentation, freshness of ingredients and balance of flavours. My dining companion and I shared a Kedgree with smoked haddock and poached egg (\u00a37.50), which is a lovely spiced rice dish reminiscent of the Korean bibim bap, and Bombay scrambled eggs with tawa paratha (\u00a37.00), which is light and fluffy scrambled eggs with Indian spices and chopped vegetables with a side of a lightly fried paratha. The assam tea and coffee (\u00a34.50 for the lot) were delicious and the tea is loose, not bagged - a big plus. Bottom line: Delicious! The wait staff was cheery and efficient. Some of the better I've encountered in a long time. Along with the Indian (scrambled eggs) and Anglo-Indian (kedgree w haddock), CK also offers a full English breakfast and some a la carte items, such as the Bangras butty, a homemade spiced lamb sausage in toasted whole meal bap (\u00a36.50). Not a cheap breakfast at approximately \u00a320 for two, but certainly worthwhile for a splurge or for a breakfast meeting with a good client. We sat outside on a gloriously sunny morning, but the interior looked polished and swanky. There is also a lounge bar, Anise, that looked great. I'd like to check that out at some point as well. I will go back to try their dinner and drinks menu and I hope to do so soon. Well, I have returned for dinner and my oh my what a dinner it was! My dining companion and I each had the seafood prix fix menu (\u00a345/ea), which the restaurant began serving only at the beginning of August. The menu comprises a refreshing aperitif, an amuse bouche, and a choice from two starters, two mains, sides, bread and dessert. I especially liked the ceviche of squid and scallop with mango, black sesame seeds, the chargrilled nile perch with lime leaf and chilli (starter) and the seared haddock, devon crab and kokum crust (main). All the seafood was fresh and expertly prepared. The desserts were spectacular as well - a mango creme brulee tart along with a saffron/cardamom infused ice cream. Yes, please!",

We went as a large group on what appeared to be a quite, Friday night. We only ordered 8 entrees, because not everyone wanted one. The waiter insited we should ALL have one & it took several attempts to get just 8. At no point were all the tables filled, yet we waited over an hour for entrees. The \u00a325 for 2 people entree selection is rather small & pricey for what you get. It was a nice change from the usual Indian restuarant, with tasty food, but I wouldnt be rushing back for the service. They got several drinks mixed up with another table, then claimed that we had ordered them! It took 20mins to summon a waiter to give us the bill, & they seemed happy to get us out. The nearby bar was good with much friendlier staff.",

My girlfriend's arranged a dinner here on a Saturday night recently and it was excellent value for money at less than \u00a325 for a three course meal with cinnamon bellini. The set menu had at least 4/5 choices for each course and the portions were the right size to not leave you feeilng bloated at the end of it. We also ended up ordering one of the seafood biriyani's at \u00a317 and it was delicious!I had to knock off one star from the rating, as there were at least a dozen bones in my mackerel main course, and the carrot cake was underwhelming and average at best. The mango mojito's are pricey at \u00a39.50 but divine, and I would probably avoid ordering the mango lassi as it wasn't at all sweet enough.",

Really well decorated in a good part of town and then my chicken turned up on my place. Uncooked. Seriously. Pink chicken. And cold. Management dealt with it swiftly, but I refused to be brought any more food because I was in a large group and didn't want to sit eating 20 minutes after everyone had already eaten. Plus, needless to say I was put off my food and ever going back to a Cinnamon Kitchen again. Although I must add that even though I could have had serious food poisoning, they only took money off the bill after a (quite loud) push. Not impressed with that.",

    "text": "Review based on two visits with positive experience both times.We had a group of six people at the last visit. Overall a great experience - all in the group rated the food highly. On arrival we were warmly welcomed and we were shown to our table. Interesting amuse-bouche set the taste buds going for the rest of the meal. Starters and main courses were all well thought out and excellent. The combinations of flavours and ingredients were interesting and, importantly, worked well. The dishes are well thought out with attention to detail. Deserts were as good as the main course. Cinnamon kitchen is quite different from your standard Indian restaurant and a pleasant surprise. On a Friday evening \u00a0the place was quite bustling but the staff were very efficient, friendly and attentive. Food arrived in good time and was well coordinated. I like the modern, simple interior design. There are some outdoor tables in the covered courtyard for warmer weather.It's fairly pricey but not exhorbitant. My expectations go up with the prices but in this case it delivered so the value quotient was also good. Five stars for me since it ticks all the boxes. Haven't tried the Anise cocktail bar next to the restaurant but hope to next time.",

It never fails to impress and very popular among both Britishers and Indian fraternity. I wonder how they mange to please people with various expectations. One of the interesting aspect was to see how manage the crowd in the Bar as it does get a bit busier and people after few pints forget they are humans. I was very impressed with their Indian Duty Manager's approach towards a city broker. My only suggestion to them would be to also open on Saturday for lunch time and perhaps change the furniture in the front area.

    "text": "Anise is a hidden (only from me apparently, as it seems to be quite crowded on Fridays) gem in the heart of the City, at Devonshire square. In spite of having worked in that area for about two years, i paid my first visit there only last month.The bar is in a large room, and unlike at most other watering holes, its located right at the centre of the room. This means that customers can be served from all four sides, which is a big advantage during rush hour. They have a decent cocktail list, with a disproportionate stress on the use of anise, as the name suggests. I would strongly recommend the anise margaritas. It was interesting, elegant and tasty. Since the cinnamon kitchen is an Indian restaurant, the bar menu has some Indian snack items in it. The chilli paneer that \u00a0is served at the bar is absolutely marvellous. I had even ordered it once from the restaurant, and have taken friends over just to have this. No one has been disappointed till date.I have frequented the bar more than the restaurant. But i have tried the food also, and found the menu to be interesting and different. Its costly (will be ~\u00a330-\u00a340 per person for a meal) and has none of the standard dishes that you will expect to fine in an Indian restaurant. I had rice with guinea fowl curry (with bone). It was good. But i didn't think that the restaurant stands out as much as the bar did.The service is good but somewhat inconsistent. Once they got me an orange margarita instead on anise and once they forgot the salt on the edges. The service can be slow on occasions. But the people there are courteous and friendly.On some weekdays Anise has a happy hour on the cocktails, which effectively makes them half as expensive (normally they are around \u00a38 each). I might not repeat the restaurant soon but it is a very good place to come to for an after work drink.",

Yeah, alright, I was 12 years early but I was right: it's just the timing that's never been my strong point. Anyway, I used to work just around the corner from Devonshire Square - in the supposed boom times - when it was home to a couple of overpriced bars and near to a couple of dull sandwich bars. Now, with the economy in the duldrums, they've got restaurants everywhere including The Cinnamon Kitchen, Vivek Singh's follow-up to The Cinnamon Club. Where's the justice? I ask you, where's the justice...? As you might expect, with that heritage, Cinnamon Kitchen is a delight, Indian food that celebrates the flavour and spice rather than the pointless macho heat, the sort of platefuls that will make your tastebuds very happy indeed and leave you feeling surprisingly light and healthy. This isn't the ghee-infested Indian food you'd usually get around the City, this is proper, modern fare in a proper, modern - and swanky - setting. As I was dining with the man behind the Bangras we had to start with one of those (and dear God, they're good) atop a mound of exquisite masala mash. I then moved on to something \"predictable\", with a gently spiced tikka chicken breast that was moist and punchy. With a gorgeous Californian Pinot Noir adding a very satisfied glow, the final flourish of Buffalo Milk Kulfi - and a superb dessert wine - sent me rolling back towards Liverpool Street with a very satisfied grin. Damned good.",

For our girl they did a straight up salmon with green veggies & rice: right on the spot (so if you go with kids who might not be used to spicy food: ask what they can do!)

    "text": "Wow - an excellent modern Indian restaurant tucked away in the city. Devonshire Square has a hidden inner courtyard blessed with crazy billiards / golf and several restaurants, Including Cinnamon kitchen and the adjoining Anise bar. The first thing you notice is the terrace, a raised platform with sleek wooden tables and potted orange trees that allows you to feel like you're eating outdoors, even though the vaulted roof is made of glass. Genius - braziers in winter mean the brave can sit outside all year.Anise bar is a seperate room to the left of the reception with soft corner booths, low lighting and sperical lampshades of silver punched with tiny holes that throw light over the walls. In the centre is a rectangular bar - I recommend their signaure cocktail - a cinnamon bellini with cinnamon tea and syrup with goldschlager at \u00a38.00. They do have a bar tasting menu, but for more substantial meals, Cinnamon Kitchen is the place to be. An open kitchen allows you to see the chefs almost from the whole restaurant, or choose to sit by the demonstartion bar for the best views. the decor is soft grey tones with light wood and the metal lampshades that echo the feel in the bar. Behind the reception desk the walls are inlaid with mother-of-pearl stars that look really beautiful. I think the overall feel is very sophisticated without being over the top or fussy. There's a dark grey and hot pink private dining room for groups that has a glass wall directly onto the kitchen to appreciate the workings of a busy kitchen. If that inspires your guests then the restaurant holds a monthly masterclass for up to 12 people where the head chefs coach on the use of spices and how to adapt traditional Indian cooking skills into today's modern cuisine.The a la carte mains range from \u00a312 - \u00a332 so there would be somthing for all budgets. Alternatively, try a few starters or tasting plates to get the broadest idea of this beautifully light Indian cuisine.",

    "text": "I had read about this place in an article while searching for Indian restaurants in London, and came across it again when trying to book dinner on Opentable, with an offer of \u00a321 for 3 courses. \u00a0When I asked about the offer at the restaurant (it was 7:30pm), they said the offer was only valid until 6:30pm, and 9:30pm onwards. \u00a0I said that was fine, 'cause I would still love to try the restaurant. \u00a0After we were seated, we opened the menu and the items on the menu were different from what we were looking for. \u00a0Specifically, we wanted the chicken curry people were talking about. \u00a0I asked about it and was told that dish was only available as part of the offer. \u00a0That's when I said to the waitress I can come back at 9:30pm - and the waitress had the manager come by. \u00a0I explained the situation to him, and he said that they do state it on Opentable (I found this later hidden in one of the menu choices, it wasn't listed with the offer on their main page); however, he said he would talk to the chef - since we are here he doesn't want to turn us away. \u00a0He ended up giving us the menu. \u00a0The restaurant had plenty of open seats at the time. \u00a0It was a very nice gesture on the part of the manager.The food? \u00a0AMAZING. \u00a0The soup with fritters had a little kick to it - just perfect. \u00a0I wished I could have seconds. \u00a0The curry was also just very tasty. \u00a0I could have had seconds (or even thirds) on that. \u00a0But the portion was just right, and the chicken very tender. \u00a0The brulee wasn't too bad either.The service was great as well. \u00a0They were busy but there was people asking us every so often how things were. \u00a0I did notice though that every person in there was waiting on all of the tables. \u00a0That can get confusing.I thanked the manager again on my way out. \u00a0I knew he didn't have to honor the offer, but he did that as a nice gesture and certainly has won points with me. \u00a0I would love to visit again - and if they could put the curry chicken as part of the regular menu as well, I think it would be a good draw!",

The starter tonight was well off the traditional path -- multi-colored beets, sweet potatoes, and pomegranate seeds with a mixed green slaw and a yogurt dressing. For the main, the *best* tandoori monkfish ever with lemon-infused rice and black lentils. This all paired well with a Pinot Gris. Only downer was that the naan & chutney was slow in arriving and less a factor in the dinner as a result. Great place. Great ambiance and decor, and simple to get to - a stone's throw from the Liverpool Road tube station.",

The decor is massively over-done, but fair play to them for really taking the concept to the maximum level of tackyness.They've got a bar you can be served at on all sides, which works well when it's busy. It's 2-4-1 drinks between 5 and 7pm, which is why you'll often find me in here - it is right next to our office after all.They also like to play super loud trance music at 6pm on a Friday - pair that with the lack of natural light and it feels like you've left work and gone directly to a club. Which is why you'll find me sat or stood outside on their terrace.",

We had mixed Indian starters, which was really good, particularly the prawn and the salmon. We had fish curry and vegetable korma for mains, with black lentils and aubergines for side dishes. We also had a mixed selection of breads and some rice. All of the dishes were good and we finished the lot, but - based on the price, and what I'd heard and read about this place, we were expecting them to be incredible. Which they weren't. We also weren't massive fans of the setting. It felt like we were eating in an overly well lit big school assembly hall surrounded by shouty recruitment consultants. So overall it was good but also disappointing.",

    "text": "We love Indian food and were excited to try a fusion approach. We've been in India many times and love the food there. We started with the appetizer sampler (not on the menu), variety of breads, and the chilled tomato soup with tropical fruit sorbet. The breads were interesting but disappointing (two types of naan and one paratha-like bread). The appetizer sampler had a few very good ones and some fine ones (nothing was bad). The chutneys that came with everything were pea, tomato, and a \"spicy\" one that was not spicy.For entrees, we had Rajasthani red deer in curry (served a true medium rare as we requested) and prawns with a masala chutney side. Both were very good. Would have loved to try the norweigan crab (one claw for 18GBP) and African wild prawn (around 30GBP) but too expensive for a dish you don't even know the preparation of and it was only our first visit so we wanted to focus on the more Indian dishes.Overall, we found the food to be mild and wondered if \u00a0they serve it that way because that's all the spice an average Brit can handle. The mango lassi was nicely not too sweet but had a good yogurt tartness.The most enjoyable part was eating outside on the patio while the World Cup game was playing on a big screen. We enjoyed the cheering and the weather was perfect for eating out. If I were to recommend it to a friend, it would be to sit outside and to have good (not amazing) and creative food.I do have to say the service needs improvement. We got soup but no spoon and a few episodes like that throughout the meal. I also recommend more details on the menu because the preparation of many of the items was not at all explained on the menu or by the waiter. I would like to know what type of curry and spices will be used (not just red deer and \"curry').",

Mains were nearer the \u00a320 mark each so jolly expensive but both were absolutely delicious. Meat brilliant and sauces full of flavour. We were absolutely stuffed so didn't order pudding although again there were a few dishes I wanted to try.A definite recommendation for a nice curry with excellent staff who were very friendly and attentive.",

    "text": "Haven't been to Cinnamon Kitchen for ages, but took my friends there last week, as they were visiting from out of town. The good news? The food was just as spectacular as I remembered. The service was a bit meh, but I was too busy focusing on my delicious selection of breads (sweet AND savoury naans - YAAS!) and chutneys (the pea chutney is amazing) to really take note. Honestly, even if you're craving a starter? GET THE BREAD. No matter what.My starter of Kerala-style stir-fried prawns were both generous in size and piping hot, which was impressive. One of my pet peeves is eating luke-warm food that's been left out for too long before being served (it might have helped that we beat the after-work rush by booking in early - think 6:30). By the time I reached my lamb biryani, I was embarrasingly full and had to ask for a box to take away (which I never do in restaurants, but had to in this case!). The lamb was succulent and tender, and the biryani the perfect comfort food. Of course, I couldn't resist my dessert of gold-leaf adorned kulfi, which caused the gentlemen at the next table to lean over and enquire, \"Sorry to be nosy, but that looks fantastic - what IS that?!\" That good, folks.And at the moment, they're running a 3 courses for \u00a330 promotion. Too good to be true, except it *was* excellent.",

    "text": "Cinnamon Kitchen is tucked away in Devonshire Square which is a nice roofed outdoor area. This was the first time I had come to the area and I am fortunate that GPS and Maps on Mobile phones are standard. The restaurant is very large and appears to have a large indoor and outdoor area. It was also very crowded but we were in a large group of 13 so found a comfortable spot in the middle of the bustle. The restaurant has a pleasant character and is easy to dine in even with the throngs of people.Service is exceptional in Cinnamon Kitchen. I was late to arrive but they managed to sit me down, explain the menu and bring in the starter and a drink when everyone else had finished theirs. When they noticed that I had finished my starter they were quick to bring the main.The food, even if looking good,was average and there was not much of it either. The main for what it was worth was not that filling being slightly larger than the starter. My main of lamb with Dhal was bland. I was very disappointed with the dhal which needed more salt and was missing much of its flavour. I realise that dhal is not an easy dish to make having tried to make it but there are many takeaways that could do a better job.My impression of Cinnamon Kitchen is that it is a place for show and not authentic enough at making Asian food. Its good for large groups with lots of money but if you want a good meal heading further east will be more affordable and enjoyable.",

The fish especially (the bream, the sea bass and the prawn- yeah, I like my little water friends) was outstanding, as was the spice rubbed chicken. Now...Dessert you ask? The Carrot cake and the ice cream milky cubes were good, but the profiteroles are DIVINE and when I say divine, I mean... I cried a little. They are out of this world good, with a spiced caramel gooey sauce on top, and a not-too-sweet cheese filling that made me see God and forget all about my macros and my weight lifting for twelve minutes. It was outstanding. I'd go back just for that.Dinner for six was \u00a3375",

    "text": "For the third year running, Cinnamon Kitchen is hosting Holi in the City to welcome the coming of spring. Holi is known as the Indian festival of colours- usually observed at the end of March- but has been embraced and celebrated in warehouses, colour runs and outdoor events across London for years. You've seen the photographs on social media of post-event revellers on public transport: they're the ones who look like they've been wilfully pelted with a confetti cannon.First, a word of warning: if you participate in a Holi celebration, things will get messy. You're encouraged to wear white from head to toe to amplify the visual effect. Don't wear your gleaming white designer kicks, though. While the 'paint' is actually a dry coloured powder and will wash off, you'll be finding residue in your ears and up your nose for days. If you're still curious- and you naturally are- The Cinnamon Kitchen is offering a perfectly concise and concentrated version of Holi festivities in their House of Holi, a pop-up outdoor space located in Devonshire Square open from the 4 until the 12 March 2016. Beneath the restaurant's outdoor terrace, participants don white protective boiler suits and are supplied with baggies of flamboyantly coloured dry powder in a rainbow of hues. In a covered room, the madness begins as the powder is flung, pelted and explodes overhead. The thirty minute session is more than enough to feel dizzy with excitement, delirious with laughter and caked from head to toe. While the powder is natural and non-toxic, it's impossible to avoid inhaling it. And the boiler suits only offer a thin protective barrier, so- again- leave the designer shirt at home. But it really is worth it because this is serious fun.The readiness of such a highly extolled city restaurant to invite guests in for the purpose of making a mess is surprising; in fact, it's worth the price for this slightly surreal experience alone. While entry to the House of Holi costs \u00a38 per person for the 30 minute session, this can be upgraded to include a cocktail and canap\u00e9s for \u00a315. It's worth the difference because the food here is truly exceptional. We sampled a selection of cold, hot and sweet Indian-inspired mouthfuls and were served by extremely charming and cordial staff. Everything was uncannily civil- bags and coats can be checked with staff and we were not barred from the inside of the restaurant to make ourselves presentable for the journey home.Don't miss out on this rare socially acceptable (and highly Instgrammable) occasion to release your inner child in a whirlwind of paint-throwing, all in the vicinity of a top City restaurant.",

We went with the American Express restaurant festival menu for 22GBP for two courses or 24GBP for three courses. We tried a chicken stew, chicken livers, cauliflower, lamb kebap, and banana cake. The chicken livers were doused in the perfect amount of spice and onions served over a small piece of naan that soaked up the sauce. I wasn't a huge fan of the cauliflower. It seemed to be lightly battered and fried with a sauce that was a bit overbearing. The banana cake was just lovely though!",

    "text": "What a let-down.I came to this Cinnamon Kitchen as I'd booked the Holifest deal with canapes and cocktails as a Mother's Day treat for my mum, when we got there, they had not only messed up our booking and ruined the Mother's Day surprise, but the kitchen was closed so we couldn't even get the other half of the deal I'd paid for! The man who seemed to be the manager of this restaurant didn't even apologise and his blase attitude didn't help one iota. After complaining about this, another much nicer man who seemed to be running the temporary Holifest event redeemed himself by offering us a three-course meal in addition to the original deal if we came back at a later date.When we came back, the Holifest event itself was good fun, the restaurant is in a lovely location and the food was very well presented and most of the dishes - not all - were quite nice. But unfortunately, this restaurant falls flat on its face due to its either rude or incompetent staff. The people at reception were snooty and falsely welcoming from the start. When I gave the name our reservation was under, the man who I'd never met before thought it necessary to announce that \"oh, you're the ones who complained so you've got the complimentary meal\", before seating us at our table - clearly and mistakenly, I was under the impression that they were the ones supposed to be making it up to us, not the other way around... \u00a0We then waited for around half an hour for water and to order our cocktails because the first waiter we had (who was nice enough) didn't know about the ingredients on the menu. Each course also took ages to come out and one waiter tried to take my plate away before I had even finished eating!It's a shame, because if I were solely judging this place on presentation in terms of food and the decor, it would get a higher score, and I was happy to give this place a second chance, but the service plays a big part in the dining experience and unfortunately the highly unprofessional staff left a very bitter aftertaste in my mouth.",
