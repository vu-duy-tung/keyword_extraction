    "text": "This has to be one of the most hyped new restaurants amongst the London food blogs. To be fair most of the hype is deserved. The food is pretty good and it's a really well thought out restaurant. It's definitely a destination restaurant and more than worth the inevitable queue.The queue always appears to be about an hour when you're greeted by the waiters. Don't be put off by this as al it takes is for a couple of people to leave and the queue disappears quickly. When we were sat the queue went from 4 couples waiting to none instantly.My only gripes about Spuntino were that it really felt a bit too American theme bar, authentic but overbearing, and the staff. One of the bar staff spent the whole night complaining about how he was hungover and tired well within earshot of the customers. He also generally had an attitude to other members of staff who were fantastically friendly.",

I think there is three different cheeses, mustard and leeks in the sauce. \u00a0the paste was extra soft because it was soak in overnight in \u00a0milk. \u00a0The portion itself is quite filling, so do share between two.Having eaten at \u00a0Polpetto prior to coming here, I totally love Spuntino alot more. I like the concept of sitting and eating in front of a counter just like going to a cocktail/american bar. i don't recommend going here in a group unless you plan to get here early. Its more suited for two's.My other friends prefer Polpetto over Spuntino mainly because you can sit down and relax.",

    "text": "I was lucky enough to go to one of the preview sittings for Spuntino before it opened last month. The owner Russell (who also owns Polpo and Polpetto) is, in his own words, 'obsessed with opening restaurants now'.Well, this one is a little far from his previous mould, but it's equally as fun - with quality food at its core the most important aspect.Given its location (nestled just next to the strip lights of Snog and the sex shops nearby), you'd be forgiven for steering clear of Spuntino. Yet, the dimmed lights and relaxed atmosphere mean that you step through the door into another world all together.There's no reservations (not even a phone), so you'll be taking a chance, but I'm told the line moves pretty quickly on a normal night. The huge bar means you're eating side by side with strangers, which adds to the informality of it all - and the bar staff double up as servers, passing your plates over from the pen in the middle.The food is 'new york style' snack bits with a comforting edge. The macaroni cheese for me was the best thing on the menu, with the sliders a close second. Ingenuity with a hint of surprise fills the lists of food, from egg and soldiers (truffled of course) and cheddar grits, to spicy sausage and lentil that also sits on Polpo's menu. The P&J sandwich for dessert is served up as an elegant corner of ice cream with homemade coulis. Just beautiful.Dishes arrive when they're ready, so just sit back, get buried in a conversation with someone special and enjoy the experience. It'll be well worth a bit of patience.",

Delights included truffle egg toast, steak and eggs, mini sliders, mac 'n' cheese, egg and soldiers and other things with similar saliva producing names. All were great but the stand out plate for me was the truffle egg toast. The sheer cheesy, truffly, eggy goodness pretty much summed up everything I love about food! The staff were enthusiastic and attentive and food came out as it was prepared. All of us wanted more but just couldn't fit it in! I can't wait to go back. Give it a go as soon as possible!",

    "text": "Full review and pics herehungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026  I kind of thought I had written up Spuntino long ago. It appears I haven't So some words about the current bloggers' favourite. In this case I absolutely and completely agree with the Spuntino-Hype. It is an amazing place, so much fun! We went there on a Friday evening which is a mistake if you are hungry. As we knew what we were up against, I didn't mind waiting at this occasion. Spuntino is very small, around 25 or so seats around on the counter around the central bar area, and has a no booking policy. It's quite comfortable to queue leaning against the wall where there is also space to put down your drinks. Yes you get served in the queue and yes I was very drunk long before we got to sit down to order some food. I should probably mention at the point that Spuntino is the little brother of Polpo and Polpetto, we are talking creative restaurateurs here.rather nice dirty martinis , I think they were only 5\u00a3 or am I wrong? The menu, even though small, is full of dishes I want to try, and it is on the cheap side. Of course considering the amount of alcohol you have consumed before eating, the bill adds up The food has a clear American theme to it with some American-Italian influences. American Rock 'n' Roll in the background and adorable guys with tattoos serving makes for a unique and particularly charming atmosphere. Finally we have a seat (to which we stagger at this point). The nice people at Spuntino immediately serve us some fresh popcorn. Unfortunately it was too salty, but one shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth The Eggplant Chips (4) with caraway seeds went perfectly with the fresh and cold fennel yogurt. Then there come the cutest burgers in the universe, and I forget to take a picture because I am just too greedy and they were gone within seconds. The best thing is that they have the perfect size to try all varieties! At this occasion we go for the Ground Beef and Bone Marrow Slider (4.50) which is tasty and succulent and the delectable Salt Beef Slider Another fun dish yet to come: Truffled Egg Toast (\u00a35.50). Plenty of gooey cheese, runny egg and the wonderful flavour of truffle amalgamate in the perfect guilty pleasure. Also good but comparably less exciting were the Calamari, chick peas, ink (7). Considering that I avoid squid usually because I hate it when it is too chewy (which it just too often is), this one was perfectly tender and went very well with the chickpeas and the pitch black ink. I had read in other bloggers' review about the Peanut Butter Sandwich with Jelly (6.50) which I considered a must try. What a great idea to make the 'sandwich bread' out of peanut ice cream. Give me more! Here you have some Brown Sugar Cheese Cake with Plums. I didn't think that plums went so well with the cheese cake, which by the way was an absolute cheese-cake heaven. We ended up making the closing time with plenty more drinks and we even made some friends. Dear Spuntino, I like you very much, you don't only create lovely food but you make me smile.",

The egg and truffle toast is comfort food in the truest sense of the word, and the view on the \"xxl video shop\" opposite through the window is Soho in an even truer sense. It's very likely that you'll have to queue, even if coming for dinner at 6 pm during the week. So, the smaller the group of people the better. And one of the places where dining solo is actually a very pleasant option: It'll be easier to get a space at the bar and you still won't feel alone.",

    "text": "Full review and photies on thehappinessprojectlondo\u2026  The Chef and I are decided \u00a0lunch is the best meal of the day. Even better is an impromptu lunch. Better than that a boozy long impromptu lunch. And the best of the best is a boozy long impromptu lunch where you don't have to go to work afterwards and can do a pub crawl round Soho for the rest of the afternoon. Well, we managed most of the above yesterday anyway. Spuntino is the new New-York-speakeasy influenced baby from the people that brought us Polpo and Polpetto and its really a delight that they are cornerning the market in Soho with cool, friendly, great value restaurants. Spuntino says it has no telephone number, no reservations, and The Chef and I thought there is no WAY we'd be able to walk in on Friday lunchtime and get a table easily. But we did \u00a0easy peasy - 5 minute wait, and the short wait continued for the rest of lunchtime, so don't be put off by no reservations. Spuntino looks fab \u00a0having just been to Wilton's Music Hall the night before to see Iolanthe, I'm a big fan of shabby chic and Spuntino has been pared back to its original features and looks great for it \u00a0beautiful tiles like it was formerly a Roman spa or a swimming pool, lovely lights. Although you all sit round a bar, you get enough privacy and its sexy enough to be a fantastic first date place and there's a great mix of friends, couples and solo eaters. We also noted that all these places seem to have the same type of staff \u00a0trendy without being pretentious, cool and friendly and enthusiastic and laid back. It makes for a great atmosphere. Thanks to the lovely Nigel for our lunch and for the pepper and thyme popcorn that make us cough. Anyway the food was brilliant: Lardo crostini and thingy-berries, delicious; Amazing truffle egg on toast \u00a0delicious strong cheese (almost Swiss, raclettey), gooey egg and truffle \u00a0you have to taste it, is amaaaazing; one marrow slider \u00a0ridiculously deep taste almost like an Italian ragu or spag bol, really lovely; Mac and cheese \u00a0only disappointment. A little underseasoned and the cheese could have been stronger \u00a0I prefer the Villandry Kitchen version; Peanut butter and jam sandwich \u00a0this was also amazing and still makes my mouth water thinking about it. Peanut ice cream with rich berries and crumbled peanuts, absolutely delicious and so CLEVER. Spuntino made us both smile loads \u00a0we had an incredible lunch and all this food, plus an old fashioned cocktail (guess who's been watching too much Mad Men), 250cl white wine and kwoffees (served Americano filter style) came to only \u00a330 each which was fantastic. It was a treat and a pleasure and the setting for our plotting the aforementioned Soho lunch and pub crawl. In fact the whole thing was incredibly Mad Men cool now I come to think about it. I will definitely be back \u00a0to try the other sliders and the soft shell crab and the stringy curly fries. You can so easily pay \u00a330 for an average meal in Soho so I'm so happy these guys are revolutionising the place \u00a0they can really do no wrong right now!",

Comfort food squared. You won't find many healthy options here, but if you like your food (deep)fried and carb heavy, your drinks strong and your bar staff heavily tattooed (and friendly), this is your kind of place. (Should probably mention the mac'n'cheese and sausage with lentils were average, but the rest of the food more than makes up for it.) No bookings.

I am not necessarily a picky eater however I dont like anchovies or egg and am a bit funny about some meats and whilst these 3 items were all over the menu there was still plenty for me to choose from and I totally adored the pulled-pork slider with pickled apple! It was totally amazing!I had a glass of the prosecco which was really nice and my husband tried the beer which he liked.It wasnt too expensive and I cant wait to return.The only bad thing is that I cant go with all my friends at one time.

    "text": "I came to bury, not to praise. After all, we don't really like a winner in this country, not if we're honest. And particularly not one who manages to make it appear so effortless. We prefer those who huff and puff and manage to succeed almost despite themselves, like Kenny Dalgleish. So Russell Norman, already the proprietor of two massively popular and critically lauded Italian tapas joints (Polpo and Polpetto as you're asking) was really pushing his luck. And how does he do with the third? Yawn, damn near faultless again... How bloody dull.This one's no bigger than the bathrooms in Spice Market, the hollow gilded cage of gaud currently parting stupid people and the idle rich from their readies in Leicester Square. And no, you won't find me reviewing it soon. I've already had a hollow chuckle at the pricing on its tired fusion menu and spent far too much for far too little in its New York sibling to fall for that trick again. Sputino probably cost as much as one of the gold taps.That's not saying it isn't designed. Norman really gets how important the look and feel of his joints is to the atmosphere. All have subtle similarities, but fit their homes like well worn hipster jeans. They peeled back the interior panelling on this old bottle shop on Rupert Street and allegedly found the most gorgeous open brickwork and Victorian tiling... Swine. A few architectural prints and oddities artfully thrown up and you're done. The restaurant, if you can call it that, comprises 20 odd seats round a battered zinc bar that's been there for years (since opening last month). It looks beautiful. Passing Shoreditch design Nazis lie fitting and frothing on the floor outside. Grabbing a seat is a total lottery here though, no reservations mean little chance at busy times unless you're prepared to watch and wait. Turn up as we did, a pair of Soho irregulars dubiously justifying a meeting on a late afternoon, go early (they open at eleven) or whistle for it, your call.Like the others, there's a simple selection of wines by the carafe or the tumbler next to a short menu of mouth watering small plates on a paper placemat. Some of the dishes port across from the Venetian tapas roots of the other restaurants; a sweet and butter soft zucchini (more on the language in a bit), mint and chilli pizzetta with a moreishly crispy base wouldn't look out of place on either menu, soft-shell crab is a favourite and there's a small selection of different bruchetta. I was more interested in the transatlantic dishes featured. The Mac n Cheese arrived with the gents next to us, a hangover cure sent from heaven. Darkly crispy breadcrumb topped oozing cheese arrived in an enormous Staubb style pan. A steal for \u00a38 and more than enough for one, though judging by the clash of forks next to us, not quite enough for two. We sampled the sliders, another obvious Americanism, this year's I don't know what (a Spanish themed version also appears on the menu of The Opera Tavern) and destined to be copied repeatedly and badly elsewhere. We took three from the selection of four; firm spicy sea-salty mackerel, salt beef with Lilliputian cornichons and small beef bombs, made further moist with bone marrow and cooked to a deep salmon pink precision within their coating of cheese, nestled into tiny white buns, chewy firm enough to stand guard against the mingling juices.We'd also sneaked in a portion of chewy eggplant chips dipped into a fennel yogurt. Interesting, the cold fennel dip was a good twist, but not up there with Zucca's, admittedly different, Fritti. Worth more than a mention though were the deep-fried olives for which I'll turn to Mr Hugh Wright, proprietor of twelvepointfivepercent dot com and as delightfully acerbic and well written gentleman as you'll ever read. \"Hot, bitter, salty anchovy-farced pellets of pleasure, laced for all I know with a sprinkling of crack in the crispy crumb encasing them.\" Words to make you smile.Do try and come. It's worth the (repeated) effort to slide into one of the fixed bar seats, and is in itself as effortlessly cool as the well drilled and friendly rockabilly bar team. So move over Paul Raymond, there's a new king of Soho.",

I would say that Ino is a great place for a date or for a casual glass of wine and a catch up with a friend. \u00a0I'd certainly recommend sitting at the bar for the best experience - service was a litte slow in our little alcove.I'd also ask them to please put handbag hooks under the counter so us ladies don't have to put our bags on the floor...",

Yelpers are going to look beyond your 'faux dirty diner' and laugh. \u00a39 for mac and cheese... are you for realz? Back in hillbilly America, you know that place you are copycatting, grits, mac and cheese, sliders, PB&J, all these are comfort, affordable foods. CHEAP FOODS. You go to Wal-Mart and you buy a dollar box of mac and cheese. And it's still better than this! We spent like 40 bucks here, that probably feeds an American family on peanut butter and jelly for a month! And they wouldn't still be hungry, like I was!I don't like being taken for a ride, but plenty of folks do, so I'm sure Spuntinos will do well.

The food was pretty amazing. We got wings, one of the better mac & cheeses in London, grits, and a pork slider. Coupled up with some Manhattans and old fashioneds, it made for a perfect meal. This place would be a zillion times better if it was a bit more cheap and cheerful and less trendy and trying. I think they get it, but it kind of puts a damper on the ethos of what American diner food is supposed to be. It's kind of in the same arena of how I feel about expensive \"dive bars\" in London, it's just a trick!",

    "text": "Spuntino has a slightly sinister and forbidding exterior (and is so discreet one might have trouble finding it) - and is right in the middle of one of Soho's most seedy streets. One enters from the street straight into a tiny room - originally a Victorian fishmonger, with high, pressed ceilings and tiles wall to ceiling throughout. They have inserted a central polished steel bar and 25 diners sit on fixed stools around this. No reservations, and no telephone even! - one just turns up and queues (or is lucky like we were and gets seats straight away). The decor leaves the rather damaged interior virtually intact as it was excavated from subsequent redecorations, but there are your typical American caged naked light bulbs and design touches. It all feels very East Village or SoHo NYC, with the food (and staff) to match. The actually very charming, friendly and efficient staff all had the most amazing tattoos on display. They do \"tasting plates\" - the idea to is order a few and share. They gave us chili popcorn when we sat down, and we ordered aubergine chips with a fennel yoghurt dressing as a starter. For our main sharing dishes we had macaroni cheese (a superb version, zinging with mozzarella, fontina and parmesan, mustard and leeks and a crispy breadcrumb topping), grilled chicory and speck and spicy Italian sausage and lentils. Stunning, and came to just over \u00a310 per head (we had soft drinks; not alcohol). There was a lovely chilled, dare I say romantic vibe in the restaurant for our late weekday lunch. However, I can imagine at peak times this place would be jumping. It's definitely worth frequent visits.",

Pefectly happy to wait for a corner spot at crowded bar while drinking amazing Dark and Stormy's and Old Fashioned's.When it came to the food, we had read about the standards and they didn't disappoint. More so, the PB&J dessert was so unusual and unexpected we were practically high fiving the fun bartenders. I loved the pate, and my sliders, and the mussels were tasty as well. All in all, i think what makes this place super fun though after the great drinks and food, was the music. If i could have bottled up the playlist, I'd know what i could play at any future party for cool not in your face, background music that keeps the energy up without trying to be a dance party.Well done, and will be going back with each london visit....",

The staff are delightful and informed (about the place, the food and the drinks!), the food is delicious and the drinks are divine (including the rotating specials).The only problem I have with this place is the danger of me waring it out by going too much. Wish there were more places like this in London, I can't recommend it enough.Note: All the seating is barstool style (great if there are 2-4 of you), and they don't take reservations. I gather the terms of the licence require you to order at least one item of food off the menu when ordering drinks, but this can be one item between a group - although it's so good you'll want to order more.",

    "text": "Another place by Russell Norman, the owner of Polpo and Polpetto, this time on Rupert Street. From the outside it looks quite modest with its dark facade and small sign. On the inside however is a small space with the bar being the main feature and some tables in the back. The bar is the place to be, with a much more intimate feeling than the tables. As for the food I have to say I did expect more. I have been to Polpetto many times (more than I'm willing to admit without torture or free beer) and that was what I was expecting. Overall the prices seemed a bit high for what you get for it. Coming in and sitting down at the bar we were served a cup of popcorn. The flavour of the day was cayenne pepper giving a nice kick to the popcorn. I only had water to drink after a very wet evening the day before so I can't really say how the wines are but judging by Polpo and Polpetto I would expect them to be very nice. First dish to come out of the kitchen was the Truffled Egg Toast. I've read quite a bit about this one and unfortunately it didn't really live up to my expectations of it. For me it was like toast with an egg yolk, bit of cheese and a sprinkling of truffle oil. It was all very nicely cooked I have to say but really nothing more than I could make at home quickly for weekend breakfast. After that the Duck Ham, Pecorino Salad and the Spicy Sausage, Lentil & Radicchio. The salad was nice but just nice. It was good though to have something green. The spicy sausage on the other hand was really the highlight of the dishes. It had a very interesting combination of flavours that I can't actually really describe but it was very tasty and superbly balanced. It had a bit of bite to it, not all the time but now and then you have a bite that brings it out. I definitely recommend this one. The Zucchini, Chilli & Mint Pizzetta was also one of the highlights. Both the mint and the chilli were nice subtle additions to the taste of bread, cheese and zucchini. I do prefer the pizzettas from Polpetto though as they feel less like a shrunk down, miniature version of a pizza than this did. Finally the Shoestring Fries came in quite a big portion and were tasty. For me though I love the zucchini fries from Polpetto so this didn't really live up to that. This is only in comparison though, taken on their own they make a nice addition to all the other dishes. In conclusion... I took a star off for the food being good but not what I was expecting and more expensive than I though it was worth, then added one back for the interior and the thought of how it would be in the evening having some drinks there.",

Feels a little like stepping into a New York eaterie. Everything I had here was delicious BUT I wasn't impressed with their mac and cheese. It lacked some substance or depth in flavour... in my opinion. The slider (mini burgers) were the best thing on the menu- I had a pulled pork and pickled apple and beef with bone marrow. Mmmm, I could have had at least 3 more! Also tried their mozarella crostini which tasted of crushed garlic heaven. The quality of the mozarella was good the the crostini perfectly crispy like it should be. Finally shoestring fries are always a good shout! Very reasonably prices but get there before 7pm to avoid the queue- this place gets very busy and they don't take reservations!",

    "text": "Polpo, Mishkin's & SpuntinoFasten your seatbelts, we've gone international. The following blog is broadcast live from London. Follow our journey via the wonders of the internets. Wot-ho old chaps!When we were last in London, Beak Street's Polpo was one of the year's big openings. A little while later it was joined by Polpetto (also in Soho), situated above The French House on Dean Street.Inspired by the osterie of Venice both continue to serve rustic food and aperitifs that you would expect to find in Italy - simple, good food and drink - plus a great bustling atmosphere that promises to bring a ray of light to dull winter days.Sitting at the bar at Polpo a few years later, we were reminded of how much we have missed a proper plate of tapas-style food. Melbourne, and Australia in general, thinks it knows how to do rustic Euro fare, but too much effort and too many flourishes often lead to stripped back yet over-complicated food. And really, if the ingredients and flavour combinations are good, the dazzle should come naturally.Bare walls, small seating area, patrons dining at the bar, no fuss and no modern design. We sipped an Old Fashioned and 250ml carafe of red wine.......and nibbled on anchovy and chickpea crostini, roast pumpkin, parma ham and ricotta salata and pork belly, radicchio and hazelnut soaking in a tasty gravy.As hard as it was to walk away from the intimate interior (I had my eyes set on a bit of an all-day drinking session), we stumbled on to the Jewish deli opened (by the same group) at the end of 2011 to rapturous excitement.Mishkin's is staffed by a team of youngsters who look more Shoreditch than Covent Garden and definitely seem intent on bringing an injection of edgy cool to this touristy corner of the city.A short, succinct menu of various meats in various breads, meatballs and all-day brunches and suppers is best enjoyed at the formica counter or in one of the leather-plastic upholstered booths.Jugs of homemade Will Skidelsky's lemonade and squeezy ketchup and mustard bottles add to the old-school feel and an array of quirky office lamps offer a spot of interest amid the understated tiled and exposed brick walls. As the website says:The boundaries in Mishkin's origins are as ambiguous as the menu's influences. Mishkin's is not Kosher (and neither, incidentally, is Katz's Deli in New York - perhaps the most famous Jewish restaurant in the world) and the dishes are based very loosely on the sort of Jewish comfort food we all love eating. Where possible we have used amazing local producers (the Big Apple Pork Hot Dog is lovingly made in East London) and where appropriate we have lightened recipes, refined traditional stodginess and, most of all, been playful.Malted milkshakes and cocktails provide refreshment. We shared the hot dog, which came with a great homemade slaw and tottered onwards into the bowels of Soho and Spuntino.No one does no-name bars like LondonSpuntino is very reminiscent of a lower-east-side New York speakeasy. Again - this is a place that an Aussie entrepreneur would think they could do easily but would end up not really pulling it off to great effect - we would end up getting the 'Australian Lite' version. We spotted the joint easily most nights as it has a queue snaking out the door, but as we were lads of leisure we could jump in just before Londoners pack up work for the day.Inside the unmarked entrance we found a dimly lit zinc-topped bar that is all about cocktails and small sharing plates - think 1920s Italian-American deli offerings and sliders.The service was spot on, especially from our super-attentive mixologist who came over to our table and give us the rundown of the prohibition-style cocktails that were on offer. We asked him to keep mixing his favourites for us until we told him to stop.A potent New York Sour and expertly made gin Martini get things flowing, served with a little metal bucket of butter and paprika popcorn. He then followed that up with a cocktail I had never head of but tasted fantastic - Seelbach. Again, I have to ask when are Aussies going to wise up to prices in Oz when every single cocktail in one of London's best bars never came to over $8.50. Less than a bottle of craft beer in any restaurant and bar Down Under.We were told to dive into the stuffed fried olives, which were encasing gooey cheese. Perfect cocktail snacks and one that I had never had before but could see working at places like Bar Ampere in Melbourne's CBD. The barman warned us that the kitchen was only on their second day as they had only been open a few days previous. \u00a0We thought they could pull it off so continued through the menu.",

We and the couple next to us resorted to using the candles and the lights from our phones to read the menu (I don't understand this idea of menus that you can hardly read).Castallero (or something) salad which turned out to be lettuce with dressing. \u00a0Also ordered eggplant chips with fennel yoghurt. The eggplant chips were pretty good though.We ordered buttermilk chicken which arrived and was completely raw inside so sent it back. The server apologised and said he would replace and take it off the bill (it wasn't taken off the bill). Beef with beets and horseradish was flavoursome and good.Also sampled the peanut butter and jelly sandwich: PB ice cream with raspberry coulis inside was nice enough but nothing special.When we were finished, we waited for ages to try and flag down the server's attention for the bill and then waited again for an age before they could bring the credit card machine for the relatively pricey \u00a345 bill.Spuntino is an idea of a New York diner / trendy hole in the wall but for me it's hard to get excited about casual American inspired dishes that should be straightforward and generous when they are turned into small plates with premium prices. The food is good but in my book as the portion size reduces, it needs to become special to justify the value quotient. Being cool at the expense of function (the website with no useful information, the almost illegible menu) \u00a0loses some of the attraction for me. The lettuce with dressing is just not exciting. America is the home of the salad. How about a decent, fresh chopped salad with lots of flavours / textures going on? \u00a0The food overall was good but not that special. I'd just much rather have the real thing with decent portions and half the price plus with the poor show on the fried chicken and slow service it \u00a0adds up to a 3 star experience for me.",

The decor is cool NYC bar style and you take your seat on the bar. The menus are there in front of you and so is a cup of popcorn on arrival. The staff leave you alone to decide but are always at hand to help. They are not intrusive at all. Great place to order a few plates, and even for sharing. I highly recommend the Mac n Cheese, but by far the best thing on the menu and a must try is the truffle egg toast. Just WOW!",

    "text": "Reading the placemat menu nothing particularly excited me but being hungry we chose a normal-sized 5oz Cheese Burger with Chipotle and Jalapeno (\u00a39) and two sliders, a Pulled Pork & Pickled Apple and Ground Beef & Bone Marrow (\u00a35 each) to share and a side of chips. To be honest none of these dishes lasted long enough to make an impression, the buns seemed slightly stale and the flavour was ok but a bit thin on filling. The chips were a big let down, super bland and everything was served on camping plates. On the plus side the service was good, staff seemed nice and laid-back, food was quick to arrive and we listened to a great playlist (which Chris Shazamed)!There's no menu online but I recall there being some interesting sides and salads you could order alongside your meat and they did have some fish and vegetarian options. For anyone that wants to know Chris and Zoe seemed to be sharing some Market Greens at \u00a34 - that's fashion week for you! I reckon they must have had some sneaky sliders to follow whilst their mate (third wheel) opted for the Mac & Cheese (\u00a39) which the barman stated was the best mac and cheese in London. Bold and probably untrue.I liked the place but not the overpriced food. I always enjoy a good burger and chips, it's any easy dish to get right even a McDonalds can taste amazing! Whilst Spuntino's sliders packed some flavour the flaws can't go unnoticed. Put simply there's too much competition doing it far better and cheaper close-by. If you're looking for a similar experience I'd check out an Red Dog, Byron, MEATliquor and pretty much anywhere in New York city.",

    "text": "Why Sputino? For the mac'n'cheese and PB&J of course! Now it wouldn't be worthy of being in the company of its sister spots Polpo and Polpetto if it didn't add some unique twists. Needless to say, for the atmosphere and vibe alone Sputino is a winner, for the food it's pretty good, and for the drinks...well nobody's perfect.Sputino is just a couple of spots away from Bubbleology and MADD (two excellent Rupert St offerings) although you can be forgiven for missing it given the dark exterior and tiny sign. \u00a0Even looking directly at it, it took us a couple of minutes to realise that we had arrived. Once in, you can take in the dark mahogany woods, massive bar, and relaxed atmosphere. It has a touch of old world bar mixed in with top end steak house. Of special note is the exit light above the door which is pretty awesome and you'll have to see it for yourself. Unfortunately, given the light differential no photos were possible.One downside is that you have to wait in line for a seat (they don't allow you to put your name down and come back later) but they will serve you drinks while you wait so it's not all bad. My Sazerac was decent but the decision to leave a massive orange peel in the drink made it far too citrus-scented and flavoured which obscured the taste of the rye. Not bad for a refreshing cocktail but for a \u00a310+ drink I want it to feel rich and worthy of the price.On to the food! We ordered the mac'n'chesse, shoestring fries, truffle egg toast, and for dessert of course the PBJ. The mac'n'cheese is served piping hot in a cast iron pan. Top points for presentation and smell but be warned - this is one of the richest mac'n'cheeses I've ever had and that includes some I've made with double cream and unending amounts of parmesan and cheddar. Tracy L and I (both known for our ability to put away food by the ton) could barely get through half of it. In fact, I'd wager that it was richer than even the Beef Shin Macaroni from Hawksmoor.The truffle egg toast is a must have for any truffle lovers. You can smell the intense truffleness as it approaches your table and each breath will send sparks to your brain. I've never fully experienced the taste of truffle until this and to be honest I think it was a bit overwhelming. The shoestring fries were a mixed bag of crunchy and soggy but the saltiness was a good counterpart to the mac'n'cheese and truffle toast.Finally the PBJ. Now this isn't the standard sandwich you had in middle school for lunch. Rather, Sputino has used the concept, deconstructed it, and turned it into a dessert. What you end up with are two triangles of peanut butter ice cream which sandwich a berry coulis and are topped by roasted peanuts. It's a great mix of flavours and textures and by far the highlight of our meal. I could easily eat the smooth sweet peanut butter ice cream all day long and the slightly tart bite of the berries was a perfect contrast.Overall, a good effort and great for a relaxed meal and drink. However, I wouldn't try it in more than groups of 2-3 as waiting for a larger space to open up could take a while.",

This is far from your everyday dining setup - upon entry through a rich velvet curtain you are seated at the American style counter/bar (all seats are at the bar apart from a solitary table of 4/6 towards the back) on high stools where you then inspect the dynamic menu. And at Spuntino a lively menu does not have to denote to unsatisfactory taste, everything tastes fantastic. The peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a bonafide showstopper and not surprisingly constantly documented by satisfied customers on their Instagram accounts.The charmingly small size however makes Spuntino unsuited for groups but a must-go for yourself and your bestie.",

The place doesn't have much seating, maybe for only about 20 people.The food was delicious, I had the slider burgers and onion rings, followed by the toast dessert. I was stuffed by the end, so maybe check with the waiter how much to order. My friend had the buttermilk chicken which was super tasty.The atmosphere of the place was great with low level lighting and an industrial feel. The staff were very friendly and helpful too.

    "text": "After enjoying many superb meals at the fantastic 'Polpo' in Covent Garden (both at the bar and seated at a table) I thought I would check out this sister restaurant in Soho. Unfortunately the service, good value and quality of food have not been shared between siblings and this was a huge and expensive disappointment. While there is a current trend in London restaurants towards 'dilapidated chic' decor, a trend Spuntino has followed to the point of cliche, this only works if the rest of your experience is incredibly good value, service is flawless and the food is creative and well executed. That is not the case here and adds to the 'poor value' feeling. We were seated on stools, not at the bar, but at a couple of 'shelves' in an alcove at the back of the restaurant facing a wall and promptly forgotten about. As a result of this poor location, the service we received was very poor and only one of the staff members appeared to have any spark about her (it felt like we were imposing on staff when we asked for anything). Definitely wait longer for seats at the bar if you insist on coming here. On to the food... sliders, po boys, ribs, pizetta, mac & cheese, coleslaw. All dishes were average at best with some strange combinations - hot salami and capers on the pizetta just didn't work in my opinion and the mac & cheese was missing the unctuous texture, sharp cheese flavour and crunchy crust I was hoping for. The only redeeming dish was the chocolate brownie and ice cream - very nice indeed! Draught beer was serves in (expensive half pint) mini tankards, PBR in the can and wine in the cheapest 'petrol voucher' high ball glasses. The same bottle of wine is cheaper in Polpo and I get a lovely big stemmed wine glass to enjoy it in! They are just trying too hard and haven't got the basics right. We weren't even offered water! To top it all off, everything on the menu is flamboyantly expensive. I would not begrudge paying \u00a317 for 4 (tiny) sliders, \u00a39 for a 'large' portion of (not great) mac & cheese or even \u00a34 for, what I can only describe as, a tiny ashtray with a dozen wizened crisps with truffle mayo if the food wasn't mediocre at best. They either need to increase the size of the portions, improve the quality of the food significantly or reduce the price of the current dishes. Our bill was over \u00a3200 for 4 people (mains, deserts to share and 2 bottles of wine) - much too rich for what amounts to fast food. If you think you might like to try 'fast casual italian / american comfort food tapas', do yourself a real favour by going somewhere else.",

The low lampshade lighting and the close knit bar stools gives it an almost New York diner feel to it.Secondly, the magic number is two, I went with a group of four and being a stubborn lot we insisted on being seated as a four, when really we should have split into 2. But we were enjoying the flow of drinks and ambience, so we didn't mind waiting... even if it was for an hour.Once seated we decided to make up for the wait and ordered pretty much most of the menu, a good 16 varying dishes, which was shared between four of us. The waitress was surprised we ordered that much (and equally impressed when we managed to finish it all).The menu does change slightly as since opening they had got rid of the salt beef slider, which I've been told on good authority were one of the best sliders they had - and additionally introduced a few new dishes. Despite this, we decided to order a couple of pulled pork sliders and a handful of ground beef bone marrow sliders to make up for it's absence. The latter was truly amazing and one of the highlights (not the biggest) of the meal. The thing was so good it disappeared in two and a half bites. I could have ordered more if it wasn't for the other \u00a0dishes we had trailing.Other highlights included the egg plant chips (fries to our American cousins), deep fried olives stuffed with anchovies, mac and cheese, which was probably one of the best mac and cheese I've had in a long long time, and the truffle egg toast. I know a previous reviewer described this as a greasy mess, and I would like to think they have improved since then, as the version I got served was really something to behold. Word of warning, please don't let the smell put you off (not as bad as a century egg or durian, but close), instead let your taste buds lead the way. Some may find the truffle flavour rather overpowering, which my good friend commented on, but for me it just took the whole thing onto a whole new level.Now for the biggest surprise of the evening, the one which just tantalised and made my taste buds turn to ecstasy was their \"Peanut butter and jelly sandwich\". No it's not a sandwich as such, but a slice, a slice of pure heaven. Essentially, two slabs of peanut butter ice cream with jelly jam sandwiched in between, sprinkled with nuts. It sounds rather simplistic, or should I say odd, but it's a must-must order for anyone who goes. For those who think they may not have room for this after an intense main course, such as devouring a plate of truffle egg toast, trust me, it tastes so good your stomach will make room for it just after one bite.",

    "text": "My friend and I have been to our fair share of tapas places in London - and when I suggested Spuntino for \"American tapas\", she almost ran there. We were definitely not disappointed.We grabbed the last two little spaces at the back, and stayed there for about 3 hours...! Our waiter was possibly the most accommodating and helpful man I've ever come across. The cocktails he made us were unbelievably sublime (and trust me on this, for I've tried many, many cocktails). In particular, the Ted Damson has been on my mind ever since. He concocted one whose name escapes me for my friend that included gin and elderflower, and she's still raving about it. Pre-cocktails, we had beer. It was also excellent. I should also mention that although I deserved one, I didn't have a hangover in the morning - I suspect that's due to both the superior alcohol and the masses of food we consumed...Onto the meal. We had Mac n' Cheese and sliders and they were exquisite - I wasn't even hungry before I got there, but I could not stop eating. We then shared the PB&J dessert (listen to all of the other reviews - it absolutely should not be missed) and the Dutch Baby, which is a sort of Yorkshire pudding pancake. Again, delicious.I'm running out of positive words to describe my experience at Spuntino - just trust me when I say that this place is fantastic, and the queue is definitely worth it. It's highly likely I'll be there with you, begging them to make me a cocktail while I wait.",

    "text": "3.75 stars. \u00a0I still can't get the truffled egg toast from Spuntino out of my mind. \u00a0Sure, it might not sound like the most appetizing of treats, but the dish is quite tasty if for no other reason than the extraordinarily generous amount of truffle oil used in its preparation. \u00a0The stuffed fried olives are so decadent and unhealthy, even Paula Dean might shirk at the fat content. \u00a0Yet, both the fried olives and the truffled egg toast are worth your time. \u00a0In fact, other than the mac-n-cheese (which was simply average), nearly everything I tried at Spuntino's was solid. \u00a0Spuntino also has some pretty amazing drinks. \u00a0The current menu reads something like a list of Mad Men inspired cocktails, and the Old Fashioned and the Sazerac take center stage. \u00a0There were some beers here as well, but I'd suggest allowing the bartenders here to craft you a nice drink. \u00a0You won't be disappointed. \u00a0The atmosphere is different in a good way. \u00a0There was a pleasant 60's soul soundtrack. \u00a0Everything is very dark. \u00a0This British take on American culture is quite interesting. \u00a0Overall, I found Spuntino to be among the more interesting places I visited in London. \u00a0I would certainly consider it as a destination on a subsequent London trip.",

That came to just under \u00a340 including tip (just tap water though) - felt like fair value. Interestingly, my date had been before and was a tad disappointed as apparently he thought the food before had been even better. The menu changes quite regularly I think.

It's small, cosy and had a buzzing atmosphere when I was there which was helped along by the awesome music they were playing ranging from hip hop to 60s Motown to Winehouse classics. The bar staff were very friendly - albeit a bit slow on the service - and the barman made a cocktail according to what I liked and it was soooo good, I ordered another two more of the same. Having said that, it was partly because the glass it came in was minuscule...We ordered food and that was pretty decent too. Everything seemed fresh and not greasy (which was great considering we ordered burgers, chips and onion rings!)However, this place isn't a bargain. The teeny tiny cocktail cost \u00a38, but to be fair, it was well made. Four sliders and one portion of chips/onion rings in one bowl came up to around \u00a320...I definitely wouldn't come here in a big group, but this place is good for a date night or with a small group of friends.",

Sitting at the bar, you do feel as though you're no longer in London, but instead in a cool New York bar. The place has a sort of dive bar feel to it, with low lighting on an evening and a cool industrial style decor. \u00a0 The genius of this place is that the portion sizes are small enough to try out quite a good selection of the menu - I can't recommend the pulled pork slider with pickled apple enough - but filling if you were just to order a slider and fries for yourself. \u00a0 My only word of warning is keep an eye on your drinks - by which I mean, we had a little...extremely enjoyable, but slightly shocking when we saw the bill experience... the wonderful staff are super knowledgeable when it comes to both the menu and the drinks. In particular, the little cocktails had caught our eye but the awesome barman offered to whip up some custom ones just for us with the kind of flavours we enjoy (all of the gin). What we weren't told and also forgot to ask, was the price. The cocktails are VERY small, so go down quite quickly...which racked up an impressive \u00a348 bill - just for drinks as they kept being refilled for us. So maybe take a designated driver if you're planning on drinking, if only to keep an eye on your bar tab for you.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying my friends and I targeted Spuntino for its mac & cheese. As Americans looking for a little taste of home, the five of us scaled the internet and ran into Spuntino as a place that had touted mac.We got off at the Picadilly Circus stop and used Yelp's map to find the street it was on. However, once we arrived at the street we looked around and could not find this place. After a while we realized extremely small text \"Spuntino\" was labeled on a hole in the wall and were relieved to have found it. When we entered, we were shocked to find it was very tiny. It's really just a bar, and for something touted for its food we were expecting a full set up. Luckily, as a party of five we secured their ONE table. Literally they had one table, able to seat 7. Just one. In a hole in the back of the place. We felt so lucky. Anyways, with a bar they surprisingly only had two beers available, with their hard drinks and spirits being featured most. They have a great menu for such a small place with one table. The vibe of the whole bar was very hip. It looked shabby but in an 'underground' and 'trendy' way. With very cool old interior architectural features. There are arches and bricks, and vintage facets to the place. It almost felt like being inside a time capsule. The music playing was great too, a funk-jazz style pulsing through the place that was complimented by dim lighting. The lighting was very dim. Maybe too dim. Onto the food! The mac and cheese took a while to get to us, but when it finally did we were so excited that we almost burned our mouths on it. The portions were large. It's very sharable, but if you are very hungry (which we were) a single person could take that dish down. It comes in the dish/pan it was cooked in which was cool.The mac and cheese is gourmet style, baked to an oven crisp on top and evenly coated with breadcrumbs. We were very excited about the fact that we were eating mac and cheese so we overrated it at first, but after a moment of reflection we realized it was all rather bland. The breadcrumbs are honestly what saved it, as the cheese used was extremely mild and didn't have much of a kick at all. It also wasn't very cheesy, it was evenly distributed, but more cheese might have helped. Overall they need to use sharper ingredients and the breadcrumbs added enough flavor that it wasn't a total loss. The service was great overall and our waiter sat down with us to take our order, wrote nothing down, but nailed everything perfectly. The prices were a little high. The mac dishes were 9 pounds each. Most drinks were around 5 pounds \u00a0Overall the environment is what gave this place four stars. The food was a good attempt, but really was 3 star flavor. The prices were high for the quality but not quantity. This is definitely a trendy place. It doesn't even have a telephone to call it! Doesn't get much more underground than that.So if you're looking for incredible mac and cheese, clearly there are mixed reviews on this, but I don't think this is the place to go. To be continued on better mac options!!",

It is quite a social place, as you can only dine at the bar and you can't avoid checking out your neighbours' food and strike up a conversation. The bar tenders are quite chatty and friendly. I would say it is a small plate diner. They are famous for their bite size burger, but I opted for Beef cheek and simple steamed kale. Both dishes were good, but not that exciting. I have to say the food is a bit pricy for the portion and what it is. I may need to come back another time, because I can see this being a fun place for dinner with a couple of friends. (Right, don't bring too many friends, otherwise, you will have to all sit in one line, which makes conversation a bit of a challenge.)",

    "text": "I've come here several times and each has been a different experience, mainly because they seem to update and change there menu quite often, so there's always something new to try. This is great because I'm never bored with there menu, on the downside, sometimes my fave dish gets 'revamped' or replaced. On my most recent visit, I have to say overall I was a little disappointed. Nothing tasted particularly wow. The Lobster Mac & Cheese honestly tasted of old sweaty socks soaked in vinegar, the coleslaw was bland and the soft shell crab slider was mainly made up of bread. I have to admit on other occasions I've loved the food - don't know if perhaps recently they have a new chef or new ingredients or something - but it just wasn't the same! Decor and service remain great.",

    "text": "As an American \"food lover\" I know that the whole \"the English suck at food\" mantra is simply nonsense...especially in London where every \"American TV chef with a funny accent\" seems to dominate...from Oliver to Ramsay to Perry Lang - there are some cool choices that do not bear the name of a guy who screams (and then cooks) for a living. So Sputino:Tiny little restaurant tucked into a tiny little Soho storefront with no signage...I was VERY skeptical when my American expat friend proclaimed \"they have killer drinks and pork barbecue\" - man was I wrong. Within a few minutes of walking through the door a super hipster bartender had Sazeracs in each of our hands and they were fantastic (by the way I consider myself a Sacerac expert and this was the best I have had outside of New Orleans where it was invented).Starters:Salt Beef Fritters - I had no idea what to expect when these \"hush puppy-like\" balls of amazingness were dropped in front of us. For Americans think corned beef sandwich in a molten hot ball of amazingness. A spicy mustard sauce makes it even better.Buttermilk Fried Chicken - To say that any Londoner has mastered fried chicken may be fighting words in many southern US cities but this fat guy will admit it...fantastic. My only criticism would be that there was not enough of it and the paper towel in the bottom of the bowl discouraged me licking the plate clean.Sliders/Burgers:Pulled Pork and Apple Sliders - to say that I was skeptical is an understatement. For those of you who have not read previous reviews...this is an area of \"expertise\" for me. I am a fat guy and I LOVE ME SOME BARBECUE. This was a complete (and welcome departure) from the sauce/rub laden bbq of the US. Simply spiced and accompanied by a pickled apple this was AMAZING. (So amazing that I think I ate 3 of them)Swiss cheese, Chipotle and Jalapeno Burger - not a ton to say about this except this 5 oz burger was gone in about 4 bites and as I swallowed the last of it...I regretted not going with the 8 oz (and was afraid of judging looks if I went in for a second one).Plates:Truffled Egg Toast - I make it a point of asking each and every serve their \"favorites\" and this (accompanied with the steak tartare - which I will hit next) was the immediate response. Holy Cow...fanFREAKINGtastic.Steak Tartare - I know 90 percent of the Yelp-reading public barely can handle tuna tartare let alone steak and know that until I did a 2 year stint in Europe did I ever even think about diving in. Fantastic and different...this will be one of the better tartare dishes you have ever had for those who like this type of food. One of the people accompanying me ordered it...and I would have eaten the entire thing if he had not (in your best Australian accent) - \"mate if you go for another bite I am gonna stab you in the arm with my fork\". So that is about it...go...be adventurous and enjoy a true gem in London!",

Staff are excellent and always welcoming and pour a mighty fine drink! I always check out the specials and tend to get the staff to recommend a drink as they never fail to impress. Food like the seating is a very social affair and great for sharing with a friend/s I highly recommend the onion rings, mack cheese and their very impressive PBJ!To illiterate great place to drink and dine when in Soho, highly recommended!",

So glad I did, after a panic'd walk thinking about which camera I used \"that one night\" \u00a0, I made it down there. She saw me at the bar and immediately told me she had my bag. Can't speak more highly about the staff and likely a patron or two at the bar who could have taken it and ruined my vacation.",

    "text": "We went there late on a Monday after seeing les mis at the queens and were absolutely delighted. Super cool vibe, intimate setting with a wrap around bar and a nook in back with extra seating. The owner was extremely generous to us. It was late and we had been turned away for food from a bunch of places so we would have been happy with anything. But I kid you not, this food was spectacular. The jukebox was on fire, the service was exemplary, and it was our favorite stop of the trip. We ordered the Bloody Mary with the caramelized onion vodka (crazy good - where we're from we see a lot of infused vodkas, this was by far the best I've tasted) and a raspberry gin drink (think gin fizz meets raspberry sorbet - so refreshing), a beer and a shot (AWESOME), the fried chicken and pancake (puts the chicken and waffle to shame - such a refreshing take on that dish. Great chicken, really crispy and the pancake had so much character), the lobster mac (I hate mac and cheese and this totally renewed my faith. It was casserole style but not dry, or bland or everything else everyone gets wrong - loads of lobster, salty, cheesy, perfect) and the pb&j dessert (holy cow, we asked him about it, he recommended it, so worth it - it was like my childhood but a trillion times better. The peanuts on top were delicious, the ice cream itself was incredible and the raspberry jam was lovely).They rounded out the meal by giving us a shot of peanut butter bourbon. Also he kept the kitchen open for us. So much pride in this restaurant. I feel like we had been missing that at the other restaurants - were they know you like it and are happy but this place really cared. Would recommend to anyone. It was really an unforgettable meal and experience.",

    "text": "I first tried Spuntino about 3 years ago after reading about it in the Michelin food guide as an American style restaurant. I returned on Saturday night and I loved it! It wasn't busy (shockingly) and so we had our pick of a seat straight away. The seating is kind of like a diner, where you sit at the counter and the servers are in the centre. The guy serving was really nice and explained the menu to us and let us know the specials. We started with some complimentary popcorn in the standard metal cups but we're going given some chilli seasoning to sprinkle on top, which was very addictive! My friend and I had already been for some cocktails so weren't massively hungry and so decided to share a couple of dishes between us. We went for the 2 specials; the barnyard pizzettia & the feta, mint and pea salad. Both dishes were delicious and the perfect amount to satisfy us. The mini pizza had broccoli, bacon and egg on it and was so good! It had quite a crispy crust and a thin base but you could still cut it easily, the bacon and egg were great and it was really tasty. Likewise the salad was delicious; gem lettuce with mint, pea and feta and the most amazing dressing. No flavour was overpowering, they all just complimented each other perfectly. We loved our meal but were intrigued by the dessert 'Brooklyn toast' so decided to share one portion. It wasn't really clear why it was called Brooklyn toast! As it was 2 brittle caramel kind of thin waffle/brioche pieces with a scoop of chocolate ice cream in between?! Regardless, we both very much enjoyed it! It was a great experience and I really want to go back to try the brunch menu. It has a chilled and relaxing atmosphere and id a great place to visit, it would be nice to live closer to it! I imagine it can get quite busy, the server was saying the previous weekend they had a constant 90 minute wait for seats all afternoon. So be prepared you may have a wait, but it is worth it!",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place, really. I was so eager to try it that after seeing the super long queue for dinner on a Thursday, we planned specially a super late lunch on Saturday so that we wouldn't have to wait too much. I had even planned in my head the dishes I was going to order... And well, lots of hype but at the end it wasn't that great. I think in some sense I'm spoiled by having spent a few years in Madrid, where restaurants like Spuntino are relatively easy to find, better and cheaper, and I had read so many good reviews that I was expecting something memorable.Anyway, on Saturday around 2pm we only had to wait about 10 minutes to get 2 places, and we ordered the following:- Pulled pork and pickled apple slider (\u00a35): my favourite dish of the day, it was very good though small.- The super famous truffled egg toast (\u00a36): this was the biggest disappointment for me, although my boyfriend liked it very much and ended up eating most of it. The egg and truffle flavour were nice but the bread and the cheese didn't appear to me as very high quality ingredients, more the opposite. At 6 anyway it's one of the best value dishes. - Puntarelle, fennel and anchovy salad (\u00a36): this one was ok, the anchovies were in the dressing, and overall the flavours were intense and good. The only bad thing was the amount of dressing, way too much for my taste.- Steak tartare (\u00a39): I was surprised with the size of this one, looking at the other dishes it had a decent size and was good. It wasn't the best steak tartare I have had in my life, but it was good and nicely seasoned. My only complain is that they don't give you enough of those little toasted bread pieces. We paid around \u00a333 with 2 juices, tap water and service which is reasonable for Soho. There are some nice things about Spuntino: the complimentary spiced popcorn you get while waiting for your food and the decor and the location of the place. The staff was nice even if they tried a bit too hard to sell the daily specials. But it's not some place I will be going back in my next visit to London.",

    "text": "I'm honestly perplexed by this place. The ambiance is great as is the location and I love all the seats at the bar.But the food is shockingly, unbelievably horrible. It is honestly some of the most offensive-tasting crap I've ever had the misfortune of sampling. Let's break it down a bit.I came for a late night meal and asked the bartender what she liked on the menu. She recommended the Chicken Pap, a fried chicken sandwich for 8 pounds. I also ordered chips.Some complimentary popcorn was served to start, but it was cold, stale, and devoid of any hint of salt or butter. Nearly inedible.The chips were the least offensive part of the meal. They were not good and about half were soft, but they were hot and well salted. Decidedly subpar, especially after picking out the properly cooked ones. These chips seemed single-fried rather than properly double fried. The Chicken Bap was about the size of a McChicken and had a few fingers of chicken than promptly fell out when the sandwich was picked up. Worse, it was drowned in a sickeningly sweet spiced ketchup and laced with even sweeter pickles. I made it a few bites and gave up.The bartender convinced me to order the Swiss Burger instead, also 8 pounds. This thing was no larger than the chicken sandwich. The top of the bun was utterly burned black. The burger tasted frozen and was covered in a bright yellow oil slick that had no resemblance to Swiss cheese. It was extremely spicy from jalape\u00f1o slices. It tasted like ash, oil, and heat. It was perhaps the worst burger I've ever had in my life, anything from McDonalds would be preferable. I didn't have a drink, only water, and perhaps customers come here for drinks. Burt I honestly cannot imagine anybody eating this food more than once. I'm not very picky at all, and it was shockingly and consistently horrible. Whoever is in charge of the menu should find a new profession.",

    "text": "So a couple Americans walked into a tapas place and then realizing it's American after sitting down and looking at the menu... I guess I'm American, having lived in the country for a while now, and intensely familiar with the current contemporary style of food.Yes, I would call this bar and restaurant somewhat American. It has sliders and ribs. But then, it also has truffle toast, salt beef, and tartare, which isn't that common in American cuisine. While the food was decent, I didn't really find any of them especially good. The sliders were probably the closest thing to getting a \"yum\" out of me. The truffle toast was especially disappointing, as it looked very promising and didn't really taste like anything. The cole slaw that came with the ribs? I could make a better version of that any day.The printed menu did remind me of some of my favourite restaurants in the SF bay area. That was a nice little touch.It's a cute place to hang out at, and always nice to be able to get decent food at a watering hole. But don't bring your American friends here, especially if they are from SF or NY, as it will likely disappoint.",

The freshly made popcorn and bourbon tasting flights added a nice eccentric touch to this sliver of a restaurant squeezed into Soho on Rupert Street. Already looking forward to my next visit.",

Another personal favourite is the buttermilk fried chicken, so succulent and flavoursome like no other. Great service and heart-warming food.

    "text": "Being the trendiest new restaurant that appears to have quite fan club here on Yelp, I thought that a counter point was in dire need. \u00a0I visited Spuntino shortly after they opened for the day during the week. \u00a0There were no other customers in sight and I was apparently their first diner of the day. \u00a0Taking my pick of available seats, I was promptly greeted by a member of the staff and offered some chili popcorn a beverage of my choice. \u00a0I must state that as an American who has lived for many years in Texas, California and New York I was really looking forward to some American diner style tapas. \u00a0Oh boy, was I let down. \u00a0While the service was quite good and I ordered only what was recommended to me by two separate bartenders. \u00a0The only thing that was American about this place was that the food was greasy, full of fat and salt and quite boring. \u00a0Perfect American diner cuisine circa 1950. Round - I started with the truffled egg toast which was a large thick cut piece of white bread covered (and I do mean covered!) with cheddar cheese and a small indentation in the middle which was filled with egg yolk and truffle oil. \u00a0At least that was what is was supposed to be. What I got was a slightly toasted piece of bread that was in a puddle of grease from the melted cheese and what appeared to be an egg yolk was a cleverly disguised yellow portion of truffle oil. \u00a0Perhaps the cook/chef was a little hung over but I practically gagged on the amount of truffle oil on this thing, absolutely wretched. Round 2 - Next up was the pulled pork slider. \u00a04.50 is a little pricey for such a small amount of food, perhaps you should get 2? Just a suggestion. \u00a0The 'pulled pork' - which wasn't really pulled, more like bits of roasted pork - had a brilliant texture and a wonderful flavor. \u00a0The combination of the pork and the apple was light and delightful. \u00a0That being said, it is not a pulled pork slider. \u00a0Pulled pork should be smoked or have a sauce of some sort or just some seasoning. \u00a0This had none. \u00a0Just pork. \u00a0Wonderful pork at that but just pork. \u00a0Round 3 - Soft shell crab. DREADFUL! \u00a0Absolutely terrible. \u00a0This dish had no flavor at all, just grease. \u00a0When it arrived it was way too hot to touch which I took as a good sign, at least it was fresh. \u00a0Once the crab cooled down enough to eat I tried it first on it's own. \u00a0Mistake. \u00a0Next I tried it with the provided Tabasco aioli. \u00a0It made it barely palatable. \u00a0If you regularly enjoy soft shell crab avoid this like the plague.Round 4 - Steak and Eggs. \u00a0This was the only saving grace of my entire visit. \u00a0A small hangar steak topped with two fried eggs arrived in all their greasy glory. \u00a0As I cut the eggs up the lovely yolks ran smoothly down the sides of the tender beef where the juices of both egg and meat mingled to provide a delectable, if not double bypass inducing, moment of bliss. \u00a0This dish was made exactly like my grandmother used to make for me when I was a child. \u00a0 \u00a0I was surprisingly disappointed when I cleared my plate as if the memory of my childhood was slowly fading as fast as the flavors in my mouth. \u00a0The only thing left on plate was the oh-so wonderful juices of the dish. \u00a0To which I suggested to a server that they should provide bread lest the wonderful bits go to waste. \u00a0Fortunately for me he then pointed out that under the 'sides' section of the menu there lay the holy grail of down south American diner food. \u00a0Cheese grits. \u00a0Round 5 - Cheese Grits. \u00a0Now, everyone in the south has their own way of making grits. \u00a0The texture is often debated as are the flavors that people add to them. \u00a0It is easily possible to get gourmet grits with foie gras, truffle, etc. \u00a0The one thing that almost every grits loving person will tell you is that the should not have the texture of SOUP!!!!! \u00a0These grits were TERRRIBLE. \u00a0Yea, that's right! \u00a0So bad I had to include an extra R! \u00a0The texture was thinner than that of potato soup. \u00a0Bad, just plain bad. \u00a0I attempted to add the runoff from my previous dish hoping the flavors would meld well but alas, once I poured in the juices the grits swallowed them whole like the graboids from Tremors. \u00a0Never to be seen or tasted again. \u00a0Recap - All that being said, the service was quite good as was the ambiance. \u00a0I even remarked that until the server's spoke I almost thought that I was back in local diner in Austin, TX. \u00a0I did also have a half of the Mean Time Ale which was very tasty although rather expensive. \u00a0I do plan on going back one more time to give it another go but I am not holding my breath. \u00a0Why anyone would really want American diner food is beyond me but I think you would be better off going to Ed's. \u00a0At least your pocketbook and your arteries would.",

The Truffled Egg Toast was a little peice of Heaven... dripping with egg yolk and melted cheese. i was slightly dispointed with the Salt Beef slilder, which was good, but nothing special. but then again its partner in crime - the Beef and Bone Marrow slider - stole the show on that round. lets say my friend started laughing at me when i tried to sweet talk it. it was that good. the beet salad was a bit lack luster. the softshell rab with Tobasco aloli was delish. and then dessert. the bourbon brownie ... you could almost get drunk on it. not too sweet with something a bit chunky/chewy in it... dates? but what blew me away was the Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich. the 'bread' was peanut butter ice cream, with jam in between the 'slices.' it was amazing. i would go back just for that alone. it was a lovely lunch, but im really curious to see how it matures. it felt like it had always been there, but there was room for growth. delicious growth.",

It's not a place to go if you are more than two I'd say because you are going to sit most likely around the bar on high stools.

    "text": "Another restaurant under his belt, and another winner. Mr Norman is a man who clearly knows what niches need to be filled in the London food scene, and he does it with a lack of pretension, and quality as a focus.I decided to drop in for an impromptu Saturday lunch, having been in the area and hearing amazing things about it, and I was not disappointed. Having walked by it twice without realising, I finally found the nondescript frontage only by peering in the window carefully to make sure it wasn't a random house of ill-repute. Upon entering, I noted that, as the reviews say, every seat was occupied. However, despite them being this busy, I was attended to by the very helpful bar staff, and was seated the minute a couple left.Perusal of the menu lead to a conclusion; I was stumped. Everything sounded so good, I had trouble keeping within the budget I'd set for myself for the day. I opted for a couple of cocktails, including their Sazerac (charmingly served in a dinky pewter cup) and a Clover Club (another cocktail making a refreshing, fruity resurgence in bars everywhere). Both hit the mark, if a little small in size (though the prices were reasonable, at \u00a37 and \u00a35.50 respectively). For food, I couldn't turn down at least one slider, opting for the pulled pork with pickled apple. It was, quite simply, like someone had taken the best roast pork sandwich and condensed it into a four-bite bun. Meltingly soft, moist (and FLAVOURSOME for a change) pulled pork vied with crunchy apple and little flecks of fatty crackling that mastered both viscerally-pleasant texture and taste. It won't win a Michelin star, but it was amazing comfort food. The same applies to the main dish, a simple combination of spicy sausage (stewed and sliced) with cheddar gritsthis was the only time I've ever seen grits on a menu this side of the Atlantic, and they were pretty damn good, with great texture and full of savoury, cheesey flavour.While the savoury dishes were satisfying, I couldn't resist a little top-up of sucrose, with their brown sugar cheesecake that was, quite simply, the best cheesecake I've had in London (I'm on a quest to find the world's best, so it's nice to see London has a strong contender). The drunken plums it was paired with were very tasty, though as little firmer than I'd have liked. I washed it down with a very fine Blanton's bourbon, which was sadly served in a water glass rather than a tiny cup or rocks glass. Still, it worked well enough, and it's a minor niggle (I work in a bar that stocks tons of antique fancy barware, so I'm probably a little biased).Overall, the experience was a welcoming, comforting one, and I could happily sit there munching and drinking for hours, if only it wasn't bad etiquette in a place this small. I also love the way that the place really does feel like a small, hip joint back on St Marks Place or Prospect Avenue back in NYCI mean it; people have made broad generalisations and repeated what they've heard about it being Lower East Side Chic etc, but I assure you from plenty of experience that they really DO capture that same spirit. I'm sorry in advance if I barge any of you out the way to grab a chair at this awesome little place in future.Thanks to Sean, my waiter/barman/greeter/new friend, he's especially on the ball when it comes to the cocktails.",

It's a nice little room, that mainly consists of a bar made of metal, you most people sit directly at the bar. The bar feels a bit minimalist, but it is quite practical. I had something that was possibly too small, to be called a burger, but kind of too big, to be called a slider. But whatever you call it, it's just tasty! The fries tasted great as well. I also liked the wine I had with it \u00a0I just don't really like to get wine in normal glasses instead of wine glasses, but as this seems to be part of the concept, I'm fine with it. As dessert I opted for a gin and tonic, which didn't disappoint me either. I was there during afternoon; it was full, but I didn't need to queue. So, if you're there at a not so busy hour or if you like to queue, that's definitely a really nice little gem in Soho, that serves one of the best sliderburgerthingy you could find in London.",

    "text": "[Non-photo Review] For full review, please go to: wp.me/pwXBH-189 \u00a0SPUNTINO - AN ENGLISHMAN IN NEW YORK (IN LONDON) Summary: The latest, smallest & funkiest Soho outpost from Russell Norman, Spuntino has a great ambience & is a lot of fun. They have concocted some great cocktails and the food is simple, satisfying & just that little bit different for London. It is a great place to drop by for a drink and/or a quick bite, but you could easily find yourself there many hours later, even if you came alone. In search of some comfort I was in London. I was working. It was late. I was alone. I needed food. I wanted comfort. Soho's Rupert Street has traditionally offered a certain brand of 'comfort', although I wasn't in the market for that. Luckily, the same street now offers culinary contentment too, thanks to Russell Norman's third addition to the neighborhood in less than two years. Continuing the Italian language conceit \u00a0his first two restaurants are called Polpo and Polpetto \u00a0Spuntino is really not very Italian at all, aside from the name and presumably the kitchen's pedigree. Russell described it to me as a diner, although this is diametrically opposed to those shiny aluminum-clad monstrosities that cater to the elderly by day and drunk college students by night, and have at least 30 pages in their menus. No, Spuntino is achingly hip; lower east side (LES) Manhattan hip. It is self-conscious of this fact, yet not in an annoying or condescending way, which is not very LES. Despite the efforts of its raised ceiling, Spuntino is a very small space, and easily gets cramped in the evenings. Ajax, the imposing yet soft-spoken restaurant manager who used to run the bar at sibling Polpo and is the progenitor of the creative speakeasy-inspired cocktail menu, informed me that since they opened the doors, it has pretty much been busy the whole day through (they open at 11am and close 'late'), every day. On my visit, they had been open for about three weeks and he hadn't had a day off yet. Spuntino is essentially one large u-shaped bar, which has a beautiful nickel-like metallic finish. There are 24 stools and a long makeshift corridor along the long side of the 'u' that leads to a small backroom, which has a table that seats six. When they took over the space from a non-noteworthy Indian restaurant, they discovered original tiles buried deep beneath the plaster. These, as well as the extra feet of space they uncovered above the previous ceiling, add considerably to the charm of the room, as do other countless little design details such as the choice of hanging lights. At night, the place is dark, the music is a slightly loud and infatuating collection of mainly American classics, and it is populated by the type of people who tend to know about cool things before others do (present company generally excluded). The staff all seemed to be tattooed somewhere or other, and almost in spite of their appearances also tended to be very professional, especially given that their computer system had broken down on the night of my visit and all the tickets had to be done by hand. As I was dining solo, and as the bar has an even number of stools, I was seated straight away despite the hulking mass of onlookers who were sipping cocktails and waiting for a spot to sit. Score. Bramerican bites As with Polpo and Polpetto, the menus are printed on a stylish thick rectangular piece of paper that serves as your place-mat for the evening. The food is somewhat of a mish-mash of things (sort of like a diner, I guess), but everything sounds appetizing and much of it seems downright naughty if you have any airs about being at all healthy.

There was no getting around it, the drink was damn strong. In addition to the main ingredients (Sazerac rye whiskey, Peuchaud's Bitters, lemon peel and definitely some kind of sweetener), it apparently contained a splash of Absinthe as well, so I knew this was going to be a walk on the wild side. Though it was strong, it was deftly balanced, and I enjoyed sipping on it \u00a0as I would a cup of tea \u00a0while perusing the familiar-looking menu that was full of unfamiliar dishes. After ordering, they brought me a mug of complimentary popcorn fresh from the little machine they have behind the bar. It seemed sort of incongruous, but the Absinthe was kicking in, so I really didn't mind. Eggplant Chips & Fennel Yogurt:First up was a dish that perfectly illustrated Spuntino's schizophrenic identity. 'Eggplant' (American for aubergine) 'Chips' (British for fries) and 'Yoghurt' spelled the British way. Despite",
