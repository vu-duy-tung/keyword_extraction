The bar is particularly uncomfortable mostly because the counter does not extend out enough to get your knees under it properly. \u00a0Also no hooks for bags and purses so where are you supposed to put those things? Wayyy down on the floor is where. \u00a0You will also be jostled by people waiting behind you as you eat. I had the fines herb omelet which was fine and came with a side salad that was unmemorable and an equally unexceptional pain au chocolat. All in all a big \"meh.\" I might return and sit at a table and have something at which excel. \u00a0Maybe.",

    "text": "One of my favorite NYC restaurants and the hype of 'designed to be identical to NYC' we had to check this place out and make our assessment as loyal NYC patrons. Result: Pretty Damn Amazing. When greeted at the door our jaws dropped and we were impressed at the likeness of the NYC look and feel. The gentleman host said to me the only difference you'll see is outside there are black cabs instead of yellow ones and then he offered to paint one yellow... now that's service. LOLOn 2 March we were transported to a mini-NYC at Balthazar after tapping redial 24 times we were about to feast! I can appreciate my fellow yelper, Kate H.'s experience of 137 attempts to get a table. I realized I needed to modify the reservation which resulted in 67 calls. CRAZY but this was a must-try for myself and some special New Yorker friends.Everything was great and aside from a few opening hiccups (all places go through them) the staff gave us a great night. I started off with the winter kale salad followed by the linguini \"Fruits De MeR\" and both were quite good. There were 8 of us and we had two reservations since they were only taking a max of 6 per table. The staff was so kind to try and seat us close together however we ended up with a round table and managed to get everyone seated cozily in the same place. There were many great dishes served up at our table, rock oysters, salad ni\u00e7oise, c\u00f4te de boeuf, duck and stone bass. One person's only minor complaint was the stone bass was already deboned. (personally I find that a bonus) However he prefers to demonstrate his skills of removing it as one piece before enjoying and like I said minor thing. Each person said they enjoyed their meal and would recommend it.Due to the newness of everything serving times were a tiny bit delayed but when you have great company it doesn't get noticed as much. So after bottles of champagne, red wine, fabulous food and yes, dessert followed by dessert wine our time at Balthazar came to a close. The restaurant is beautiful and the food was very good. I'm sure with time their service and delivery times will improve. One of the managers was kind enough to drop by and chat with us. She was visiting from the NYC restaurant and helping get London on track. I look forward to my next dining experience at Balthazar and I'm almost certain you'll enjoy it as well. Cheers to a little piece of America right here in London y'all!",

I met two friends with whom I had been the NY version - just so we could compare notes! Walking in, I thought I was back in New York. It is almost identical! I had the snails to start with - they were delicious (well, they were unbelievably garlicky - which is about all you want from snails really). I actually swapped a snail or two for a couple of my friend's oysters - also really really scrummy (the oysters, not my friend. although she is pretty hot to be fair). I then followed up with Chicken Paillard, which was damn near perfect. You know what I like most about Balthazar though? It's French cuisine, in London, run by Americans. This means that the food is exquisite, I can get to it without boarding a plane or an international train and the service is bloody excellent. Really, they can't do enough for you - which is such a pleasant change when ordering French food!",

    "text": "This is a fancy food factory. The dining room is quite nice, but there are two main problems with this place:1) The service: everything goes too fast. It is very clear that they have been instructed to get as many seatings in as possible. You barely get to sit down before someone is there to take your order, the main course comes directly after the first course, and they start clearing the table before you have finished. That being said, the staff are all very nice.2) The food: I got a steak which wasn't bad, but not something very good either. The chips which came as a side was like McDonald's chips with less salt. An with that came a bernaise sauce which isn't really worth mentioning.I have had far worse dining experiences, but it doesn't change the fact that this is tourist trap although of the better kind.",

    "text": "So swanky, so glam - the attempted Shoreditch hipster in me was waiting to find something wrong at Balthazar. \u00a0A lot of the staple London must-eats have disappointed in times past. But alas. This was the real deal.My partner booked us a spot for my Sunday Birthday lunch here. We received a perfect corner table tucked in, in the middle of the restaurant - a perfectly romantic setting.Despite the restaurant being full - of families, couples, etc. the acoustics were great and it was easy to carry on a conversation. From a service perspective, everyone was really attentive, providing space to enjoy our meal but always coming over to keep the champagne flowing.For food, my partner went for the eggs benedict and I opted for the eggs norwegian. We shared escargot to start. The eggs were made absolutely perfect, in fact I'm now convinced that almost every other brunch place I've ever been to needs a lesson on \"how to make the proper egg\". \u00a0Once our plates were delivered, we opted to have some bread from the bakery with our meal (as opposed to the basket which just seemed like too much food with everything else) - and yes, save space for the bread if you want a little taste of France with your meal.The escargot in garlic butter was pretty much one of the best starters I've ever tried. I've attempted to now order it (thinking it was my new thing) at other restaurants since, but nothing has compared. Highly recommended even if you don't fancy yourself and escargot eater, or are trying it for the first time (though be warned...it will never be the same after). In short, make a special occasion with someone special and go!",

You get that French Bistro feel as soon as you walk into the restaurant. They have a lovely display of fresh seafood: lobsters, crabs, shrimps and, of course, oysters. The menu here is big and quite French, so if you are in the mood for steak tartare, escargots, duck and steak and frites, you have come to the right place. Since the restaurant is in London, you can also have some British flair, like a duck shepherd's pie. We must not forget the daily specials. The evening we went was a Sunday, so I went for the ox cheek bourguignon, because the server highly recommended it to me. It was adequate but not great. The sauce was way too heavy and instead of the flavor Burgundy wine, I just tasted salt. However, the meat was well cooked. I think next time I will not ask for the waiter's recommendation and just stick with steak and frites.",

Lovely atmosphere and decor - great to take a date or your visiting guests from abroad. \u00a0The food is of a high standard - the duck confit was as good as we have sampled in France. \u00a0The afternoon tea was good value at \u00a325 compared to the high end hotels such as the Ritz or Claridges; scones were delightful and the patisseries beautifully presented. The sandwiches were rather average and dry though.During the day, the venue is casual enough for children however the acoustics of the room means it gets very noisy. There were large groups of ladies-who-lunch, sipping their tea and we felt slightly out of place in the grand settings. \u00a0Highchairs available, tables a little tightly packed to house buggies.

I needed to try the Escargot since it's been a while since I had them - queue NYC Balthazar. DELISH!! They were so lovely, I thought each was cooked individually - not one chewy mollusk in the bunch.Onto the scallop & courgette risotto...creamy, morish goodness. The scallops were melt in your mouth goodness. The vodka cocktail washed all of \u00a0it down nicely.My mates had a variety of dishes and all were tucking in heartily too. Not an empty or unsatisfied stomach among us.

    "text": "This was in all likelihood going to be the review that got away. I've spent time in the original Balthazar and had some lovely lunches but, especially in a white hot, can't get a table for love nor money, opening period, I'd resigned myself to forgetting about the London branch. And anyway, who really wants to go to the London branch of a slavish New York recreation of a traditional French bistro? I could be on the Eurostar before they'd answered the reservations line.As it goes, it's reasonably quiet, even on a Thursday lunch, and therefore the perfect spot to slide into a banquette opposite the International Man of Mystery. He's never sure which city he's in at any given point in time, so this level of high class generic internationalism is perfect for him.It's not cheap, their range of French classics, but if you've come here deliberately you know that and are comfortable paying \u00a324 for a plate of Steak Frites and \u00a317 for a burger. If you're a wall-eyed tourist who has just stumbled across its prime Covent Garden location then congratulations. You're going to be fleeced, but in a much more pleasant way than if you'd wound up in the Angus Steak House.Get a back wall booth if you can, perfect for people watching amidst the monied buzz and much, much more room than on the cramped banquettes filling the centre of the room.After being spoilt by their homemade bread, the ceviche starter was utterly underwhelming, a few rings of squid or octopus in a vinegary coleslaw of mandolined bell peppers and onion. From a distance it looked perfectly pleasant, but ended up being pushed around the plate.Confit duck on the other hand was perfect. Rich and unctuous, it fell off the bone like a dark brown silk dressing gown sliding from a dressmakers dummy. Definitely a contender for comfort dish of the year, though at the price it bloody well should be.It's a lovely cavernous space, with decent food slightly over-assiduous staff (that'll be the New York influences rather than the French) but for the money, the ambience and the attitude, I'd much rather be in Zedel, sucking down champagne with the money I've saved on my steak. If it's a power lunch that I need, then I'll be back at the Wolesley first.",

    "text": "A beautiful large, French bistro in Covent Garden with tablecloths and waiters in uniform. Service is attentive but the waiters are particular about their respective areas so you can't call on a different waiter even if yours is busy.We went here for lunch: grilled salmon on warm spinach, walnut and lentil salad; club sandwich with frites; basket of warm fresh bread. All delicious and fairly large portions. Very quick to bring to the table. Maybe we didn't order the right things but they weren't particularly special. The chips were very bright yellow which made me the think the oil may not have been the best. I enjoyed the club sandwich despite it falling apart in my hands because of the soft French sourdough loaf bread used. Two lunch mains for \u00a338 is a bit steep but good if you're in the area and looking for somewhere fairly refined to eat.",

Turned up again, hopeful, two hours later and got a table for four easily. Front of house was great and waiters were perky and professional. Toilets were very clean but a bit tricky to reach, staff were on hand with helpful directions. Food ranged from usual French options of onion soup to extravagant veal.

Was it worth it? Well I wouldnt do it again but since it is one of those place I have been wanting to try ever since it open then of course it was worth it for the first time!As a French brasserie you will find steak, French onion soup and one of my favourite Escargots. There are not many places in London that I have tried that does it well. Balthazer escargots was nice and better than other place. But it just does not compare with ones I had at Galvin bistrot de luxe which comes in a wonderful garlic butter sauce that you want to scoop off with bread.Balthazar serves two different pie including a duck pie which is very rich in flavour. The one I recommend and the dish that I give a big thumb up has to be the Fish Pie. This was true comfort food and an indulgent to have for dinner. It has to be my best fish pie I have had in London.You can not leave with out ordering the souffl\u00e9s. It is \u00a310 each but they are big enough to share between two people. The waiter who was serving was friendly and a laugh. Even before our souffl\u00e9s arrive he explain how to eat it - make an indentation at the top and pour the creme in to it. Then you ready to enjoy a light raspberry souffl\u00e9. I have to say that this was the only reason I have been wanting to visit Balthazar!Fish Pie and Souffl\u00e9s is what I would want to visit Balthazar! Delicious!",

Followed by the FILLET DE BOEUF AU POIVRE with pommes frites and spinach, it was downright great! So peppery, perfectly cooked. Just splendid. My husband had the grilled salmon which he wasn't too happy about. He was expecting grilled marked but it looked more like steamed than anything else and also was lacking in salt n pepper.

Although we waited for 15 mins (to be fair we were told it would be a 20 mins wait) we got seated and ordered. I opted for the eggs royale but was told by the chef via a waiter that it contained alcohol which i'm allergic to. I was told the chef would try to create a sauce but it didn't go well - again, i was told. I honestly tried the dish and it tasted dry as it needed hollandaise sauce to give it that special oomph. My friends could see my distress and garnered the attention of a staff and I was given the menu to make a whole new order. I opted for the \"avocado and eggs\" dish as recommended by the chef. The tomato salsa was to die for and hopefully I'll get to recreate the dish as everything worked undeniably well.PS: To the staff at balthazar, sorry if I came off rude but I was extremely famished.",

The Porn Star cocktail was beautiful. I was not starving so I didn't go for a heavy plate. I ordered the Moules Frites. I feel like I can't give it 5 stars as mussels are pretty easy to make and a place that can't cook Mussels and French fries probably shouldn't be in the food business. It is pretty hard to ruin that dish. I did try a bite of my friends Beef Fillet Stroganoff and it was devine! I have never had Stroganoff before as the name alone never appealed to me but wow! what have I been missing out on?!? I also tried her Chocolate Fondant, I don't even like chocolate but wow! Just wish they served more vanilla ice cream with this dish as I have never seen so little ice cream on a plate. Overall this place is a solid 4 stars in my book!",

The restaurant, decked out for the holidays, was bright, cheerful and bustling with an energetic crowd (bar was packed). We arrived 20 minutes early and the hostess, without asking, graciously arranged for us to be seated 10 minutes sooner.Started with the French onion soup, which I had read, was highly recommended. The gruyere \u00a0cheese was bubbling and browned and when my spoon broke through its lovely surface, a flavorful (but not at all salty) broth with plentiful onions and bread awaited. I would have been satisfied eating just this, but I had to try the steak friites, which also did not disappoint. Fries did not overwhelm me, I must confess. They were a little undercooked and not seasoned enough, but the steak itself was fantastic.Of note was also the side of green beans with shallots. I devoured them with the steak. They were the perfect accompaniment to the steak.We did not save room for dessert but the plates looked great we saw going to other tables.London has definitely become more of a destination for dining in recent years and this restaurant is one that helped to turn the tide. I look forward to checking out the New York location and will definitely return to this one next time I am in London.",

    "text": "Despite being in the hustle and bustle of Covent Garden, Balthazar provides a relaxed and friendly environment for a delicious meal - and they even serve decent coffee.It took me quite a bit until I made it to Balthazar in Covent Garden, but one afternoon I finally managed to go there. A few months ago, I read a rather interesting article about the New York company and ever since wanted to gain some first-hand experience. Usually, Balthazar was always very busy when I considered visiting, but on this late Sunday afternoon, it was easy to secure a table.Supposedly, the London branch is almost a 1:1 copy of the New York venture. I cannot \u00a0verify this, but I can tell you that the main dining room is huge and grand, with heigh ceiling and some vintage coolness. The rose-inspired lamps hanging everywhere are cute, while also pretty kitschy. And in case you want to know, the toilets are beautiful, too.I started my late lunch with a lemonade. And what a lemonade! It was kind of a bespoke service, freshly pressed and delivered with a supply of cold water, like a do-it-yourself drink where I could decide how much water or sugar I wanted to add. The waiter was overly friendly and I instantly liked the place after this great start. He and his colleagues continued to impress by topping up my water seamlessly throughout my stay.I went for the cheese burger with fries and crispy bacon. It was a mighty and pretty messy beast. After I had removed the tomato, the gherkin and the onion, the burger became much more compact and shrank down to a size I could handle. Still messy, but manageably messy.Initially, I wondered why I was offered no condiments. As I ate my way through the massive burger, I noticed that all kinds of delicious juices \u00a0and sauces were oozing out and my plate quickly became the right place to dip my fries, no need for additional condiments. The fries also deserve a separate mention. The thin-cut potato strips were golden, crispy, superbly spiced and overall delicious.To complete my meal, I ordered the profiteroles. This dessert was surprisingly big, packed with lots of ice cream and a dark, strong chocolate sauce.After all this food, I felt really full and decided to do something about this and concluded my visit with a coffee. I was happy when I learnt that they use Monmouth coffee - a staple choice in the London coffee landscape, and they are almost neighbours in Covent Garden. I must say, that I was very satisfied with the food and service at Balthazar in London. Really a place I can recommend, even though the location makes it come across as a tourist trap.",

However Balthazar lives to it's reputation with good service and impeccably classic setting and dishes. The themed afternoon tea brings a little more 'edge' and quirkiness to their concept of elaborate dining. The restaurant very much reminds me of Cheri in Barcelona. With cloudy yellow lighting to create intimacy, mirrored walls and monochrome marble floors give it that 'socialite' feeling of you being in an occasion spot in Paris in the 1920s. The formally dressed staff just add to the classic feeling of being served in something a bit more exciting than you typical urban bistro full of design enthusiasts with their macs. The afternoon tea menu's included savory sandwiches with classic ones such as the cucumber, which is my guilty pleasure. The scones were nearly perfect with a lovely light and airy texture, sweet clotted vanilla team and classic blackberry jam. The highlight of the themed experience were the sweet pastries that were shaped in lips, eyeshadow palette and a mascara. My personal favourite was the yogurt mousse in the shape of lips. The rhubarbs shaped into an eyeshadow in a chocolate cream tart was also a close hit. Overall I think this afternoon tea is wonderful quality, considering the price with the perfect atmosphere of fancy dining and being a hot-spot in Soho. It's amazing if you're looking for something in central that offers the traditional afternoon with a themed twist, though nothing overly strange nor experimental. The unlimited offer of tea, cakes and sandwiches available also to take home was a big plus. The professional staff service and atmosphere makes this place a go-to for any fan of French cuisine.",

Anyway, we happened upon this location in Covent Garden and decided to dine here. Of course I had the steak frites, and it was sooo good. The meat was a little on the rare side but I like it that way, and the French fries were perfect. I also ordered the salad with butter lettuce and hazelnut - delicious. Great ambience and the staff wears old-fashioned uniforms. Plus, I think the menu was priced less expensively than the NYC one, even with the conversion!",

    "text": "grilled langoustines (yabbies) with green tomato salsa, chives and aromatic oil served with Jacob's Creek Reserve Adelaide Hills Chardonnay 2013 - a very light white wine that makes it a great companion to shellfish and white meat seafood - I think I just came up with the term, white meat seafood. I am thinking sea bream, bass, monkfish and halibut. Probably mackarel and tuna would be too strong and cloud the taste of the wine. The wine has also a very strong oak aroma and smoky bouquet that is not present in it's taste. I was glad otherwise it could all be a little too much. hot smoked duck with cherries, beetroot and braised lettuce accompanied with an Adelaide Hills Pinot Noir and cherry sauce served with Jacob's Creek Reserve Adelaide Hills Pinot Noir 2013 - with some serious buttered vegetables together with the layer of fat in the duck was, to some, delightful. I only managed one and had to take the other two off because it was just too much. The meat was a little tough and chewy but the intensity of the deep dark cherry sauce was very nice. The wine was easy to drink, very mild tannin that brought out the gameness in the duck.kangaroo with pepper, cabbage, pancetta and carrot with Barossa Shiraz sauce served with Jacob's Creek Reserve Barossa Shiraz 2013 - It was the best kangaroo meat I've had but I can only compare to Iceland supermarket's frozen kangaroo meat (there, I said it!) and I thought that it was a slightly unfair comparison so I referred to a true Aussie foodie that was there that night. She confirmed that it was very good indeed; so lean and cooked to perfection. It was good with the suggested Barossa but I thought that it was equally good with the Pinot Noir too.dark chocolate sphere with mint, eucalyptus and a hot chocolate sauce served with Jacob's Creek Reserve Coonawarra Cabernet Sauvignon 2011 - after seeing so many media videos of chocolate desserts melting when sauce is poured, this was my reality moment. But chocolate sphere did not entirely melt and the waiter was not going to wait for my silly phone camera to come on. Shame...tea, coffee and petit fours - macaroons, lemon meringue and chocolate were delicious. The cold coffee was not great but these petit fours, especially the lemon meringue, were delicious! I had the last sip of my Chardonnay Pinot Noir Brut NV with this sweet tangy dessert and to mark the end of a wonderful evening.",

I can appreciate wanting to ensure I made my show time (reservation at 6pm, show at 7:30), but still I had an appetizer and my main in front of me by 6:20pm... and that was after leisurely looking through the menu! Also, the restaurant itself gave a very cramped feeling. So much so the couple next to me and I commented on it.The appetizer (octopus, tomato, basil) wasn't exactly flavorful. The main (stone bass) was more up to par with a delicious artichoke pur\u00e9e.  The bottle wine list was very extensive with plenty of French wine to choose from. The wines by the glass had reasonable selection.All-in-all, I'd say a touch above average for this caliber of a restaurant. If someone brought me back here it'd be ok, but I would seek out another place for myself.",

As I missed out on going to the SoHo restaurant while I was living in NYC, I redeemed myself (a little bit) by checking out Balthazar in Covent Garden.To me, the interior is expectedly like an \"Americanized\" French brasserie, and the open dining space with many chatting diners/busy servers made the atmosphere very warm. We were lucky to get a table immediately on a Saturday early afternoon, followed by quick service.We started with the chicken liver & foie gras mousse as starter. My friends described that it was smooth like cheese spread. We then proceeded with scrambled egg & cornish crab with a side of mushroom fricass\u00e9e, sweetcorn fritters, avocado on toast with poached eggs, and hazelnut waffles. All the entrees were delicious, and we devoured our dishes in no time.I am glad that I got my brunch fix.",

    "text": "Another solid London brunch destination. It's a French brasserie, reminding me a lot of Colbert on Sloane Square and some of my favorite brunch places in the US (Parc in Philadelphia and Left Bank in San Jose, CA). The location could not be better (it is right off the Covent Garden Piazza), and the venue is grand and beautiful, with enormously high ceilings and loud jazz music playing throughout. We had a reservation for 2 people, which we managed to get by emailing the restaurant, despite no availability showing up on the online booking system. This is the second time that I've been able to get a reservation this way, so I would highly recommend it if your desired times are not showing up at first glance.The food and service were also stellar. It was actually just like being back in America. I ordered scrambled eggs & Cornish crab, which came served on a piece of toasted sourdough bread and with a side of creme fraiche. The eggs were wonderfully creamy and the crab was plentiful and just perfect. I could not have been more pleased with it. One piece of toast doesn't seem like an awful lot, but I was so full by the end. My friend got the avocado on toast, but managed to switch out the poached eggs for mushrooms and tomato, since she doesn't really eat eggs. She also asked for some goat cheese, which the staff happily obliged, even though it isn't a standard menu item.I was very impressed by the whole experience. No complaints about Balthazar and would definitely come again... the rest of their menu looks equally amazing.",

We shared the pastry basket which had more pastries than we could eat. I had the caramelized grapefruit which I'd never tried before. The caramelization took any bite the red grapefruit ya have had, it was very good. The only problem I had in eating it was they didn't provide a grapefruit spoon to dig out the fruit with so it was something of a trial to eat. My friend had the full English breakfast which looked wonderful and she said was terrific. The hostess and wait staff were superb and we lacked for nothing, and didn't have to wait for them to assist unlike most places in Europe. This is not an inexpensive place for breakfast but the prices were reasonable considering what you receive and that London prices are very high anyway. Overall I highly recommend Balthazar's for breakfast or brunch. Next time I'm in London I plan to give it a try for dinner!",

    "text": "It is a pleasure to review a restaurant like Balthazar. \u00a0In a nutshell, the food is excellent and the service is impeccable.Here are the details:- Bread - I simply have to start with Balthazar's homemade bread. Every single kind of their bread is spectacular, but I'd like to single out the sun dried tomato olive buns. \u00a05 stars all the way. (Btw, their butter is great too).- French Onion Soup - very good. Savory, beefy and with a healthy amount of gryere, very intense. \u00a0One minus - too much bread in the actual soup, which sucks up a lot of the liquid, making the soup a little dryer than I'd like to. \u00a0That said, still a solid 4.5 star dish.- Escargots - very good, garlicky, buttery and just yummy. \u00a05 stars.- Garlic Shrimp - the shrimp is good, but the sauce it comes in is out of this world. \u00a0It has a slight kick due to the addition of chili peppers. \u00a05 stars.- Mac & Cheese. \u00a0Very creamy and not as intense as I expected it to be. \u00a0Made with gryere. It deserves 4.5 stars, and the reason I'm not giving it full 5 stars is because it was the least memorable dish I had.- Burgers - Very good burger, cooked to a perfect medium rare but not the best burger (not even in the vicinity) I ever had. \u00a0The meat was excellent quality but underseasoned. \u00a0Two other major issues: 1. Bun - too big and 2. the patty is on the smaller side. \u00a0For that size of the bun, the beef patty has to be at least twice that size. 4 stars.- Beef Tartare - Excellent! Prepared \"au couteau\" (hand cut), well seasoned with the slightly higher note of acidity. \u00a0Add some hot sauce a freshly ground black pepper for a heavenly concoction. 5 stars.- Moules Mariniere (mussels) - great. \u00a0Fresh and fenomenal. 5 stars.- Rubharb Souffle - WOW! With a side of creme anglaise this was the home run of the evening. 5stars and it doesn't do it justice.- Small dessert pastries - every single one was better than the other. \u00a0The macrons, the cream filled dark chocolate \u00a0and the chocolate filled cookie cups. 5 stars!I hope you'll enjoy Balthazar as much as I did.",

It looks very much like the one in downtown New York, but much bigger and along with that it loses some of its intimacy. What was imported across the pond was a good helping of New York type attitude. The service was a bit cold and always seemed to be bored with whatever was said or asked for. Our waitress could barely be bothered to help with the wine when I asked if they had a Bordeaux by the glass she seemed confused. There also seemed to be the bare minimum of interest shown while just getting the job done properly. The food was good but not amazing. You would think that a pretty straight forward Steak Frites with Bearnaise would be delicious in a place like this. \u00a0It was fine, but lack luster. Starting with the meat which was not cooked the way asked more medium than medium rare, and also not the best cut of meat. The Bearnaise was a bit thin and vinegar-y, overall just a bit off and not what you would expect. Dessert of Tarte Tartin was delicious though.Nice enough, and for Covent Garden Piazza a bit of an oasis if you want something a bit more upmarket. The bar makes a great place for pre opera drinks.",

    "text": "I came here for a solo lunch on a Tuesday afternoon, with no reservations, and I was seated promptly. I had half a dozen oysters to start, which came with a choice of two salsas/vinaigrette to spoon on the oysters, but I asked for Tabasco anyway. Oysters were fresh - no complaints. I do wish the bread they served prior was freshly baked...I asked for a recommendation for my main, and oh boy! My waiter recommended the plate du jour, which was vaguely described to me as pork belly. I do love a good pork belly so I went along with it. Goodness gracious me! The pork belly arrived, on a bed of poached greens, with the skin crispy and slightly sweet, and there was additional pork crackling on top, and blood pudding on the side. They didn't forget a sauce, and to go with all that goodness, pur\u00e9ed apple was hiding somewhere to complement the pork perfectly. Despite the sheer amount of pork elements on the plate, it wasn't overly porky and there was a lot of difference within these elements to wow me. Party in my mouth, it was. Loads of places can do a decent pork belly. But not many places can combine it with other pork elements, and do the classic pork and apple combination to a T. I didn't get dessert because I was stuffed, but I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch here.",

Food was good, had the raw seafood tower and the steak. Only slight negative was the service which was good and friendly but seemed they could have had a couple less tables to cover to provide a quciker response. All in all, this restaurant is good place for a date or drinner with friends/family.",

The bacon is not fatty like the one back in the states, the sausage was soft (not chewy), the beans weren't as sweet (which was nice), the fried bread was interesting (not my cup of tea, but nice to try), and my eggs were prepared to perfection.They also had green juice, which I desperately needed after eating such a heavy meal.",

Both options were delicious. Tea is served in a large pot, and our water was topped up continuously. They didn't mind that we stayed for a couple of hours talking. This is a good place for intimate dining, though the tables are too close together and you sometimes feel as though the people at the next table can hear everything you say.

So without checking the menus outside we just entered in! For breakfast, menu is quite extensive but nothing special in comparison to other French cafes/chains/restaurants/bistros. Ah, maybe more expensive! For single eggs royale in Balthazar, I can get eggs royale (w 2 muffins) and drink in my fav places with same price. I must note that the waiter was so attentive. I was not sure about to order Le panier -selection of mini pastries and bread basket - he brought the basket to show us what we would receive. Pastries were a bit hard but I liked homemade jams and marmalade. Another note is tea pots are big that you can almost have 4 full cups. Nice! Nice ambiance, tasty food, I will arrange my next visit soon for dinner.",

The restaurant kept apologizing for the wait and were kind enough to offer a bottle of champagne while we waited for our table to clear out(bonus!). \u00a0I was just surprised and pleased in a way with the profuse apologies...Not used to it in America!

Actually, I take that back. I can't tell you. You just have to try it for yourself. You will seriously feel like you're being whisked away into the clouds while sitting on a bed of fries.

    "text": "I stumbled in here when looking for somewhere to grab a bite on my lunch break. Not realising where I actually was I ordered the French onion soup and a chicken BLT. It took me a few minutes to realise that this wasn't your typical cafe. Bread lined the walls, the cakes on display looked ridiculously good - especially the donuts - and everyone (the staff) was speaking with a French accent! I still haven't sussed if they were real or fake accents yet...The price for a soup and sandwich was costly (\u00a311!!) but at this moment SO worth it for a warming lunch having been out in the cold for so long. The French onion soup was everything a French onion soup should be and you could tell it had been stewing for quite some time. It also came with some large cheese croutons for dipping - a nice added bonus. Highly recommended.Then to my sandwich. I was actually rather full from my sandwich so I saved half for Jody but I must say it was a pretty decent sandwich - the bread, as with those hanging on the walls, was fresh and tasty and the fillings distributed well - no sandwich gaps, woo (big pet hate of mine)!I finally realised, after stuffing my face, that this was the cafe section of infamous Balthazar (which I am yet to visit)... Definitely worth a visit for a nice alternative to the hustle and bustle of Covent Garden and a much cheaper option than the main restaurant itself.",

We were immediately greeted at the door and sat at a table. Our server, Ridas, went above and beyond to make sure that our dinner was amazing! He was such a hard worker and the restaurant is lucky to have him. We started with the Burrata with tomatoes, olive oil and basil. Every ingredient in this appetizer was so fresh, kicking our meal off to a great start.For dinner, I had the veal schnitzel holstein with green beans served with a fried egg on top. This schnitzel was delicious! The veal was tender and flavorful and fried to perfection--crispy and not greasy. The green beans and egg were done perfectly and added to the dish well. My husband is allergic to onions and garlic and was super bummed out when they told him that the side of macaroni and cheese had his allergens. We wanted to split the mac n' cheese. Our server and the chef went ABOVE AND BEYOND to make this mac n' cheese possible for us. Ridas advocated for us and the chef made a special batch of mac n' cheese just for us. We were blown away and the mac n' cheese was so good! It was perfectly cheesy, not oily and the pasta was cooked perfectly. Overall, superb service, outstanding food, fair prices, and great ambiance! We will definitely be back when we go to London again!",

Hosts are still rude, so we just decided to grab drinks and a dessert rather than spending money here on dinner if it was going to be just as disappointing as the staff. Luckily, the bar staff is a little nicer. We ordered a carafe of red wine and dessert, which was not worth remembering the name. It was like a panda cotta with a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e top (torched sugar) which was unevenly torched, the middle too burnt and the sides left with raw sugar. I did feel like the flavors were wonderful, but the presentation was unimpressive. Overall, my experience here was not worth coming back. If you're looking for nicely done french food, keep searching. I will say the ambiance is aimed for a more romantic feel, but the decor is very similar to that of the Cheesecake Factory (an American chain restaurant.) I apologize for the not so great photos, the lighting inside at night is not ideal for photos and I didn't care enough to waste my time editing them.",

If you dine in, the cost of each dish is increased by about \u00a31.50.The sausage texture was soft like a minced meat. The roll itself was extremely oily but it tasted great (probably because of all the oil). The roast beef sandwich was great toasted, although it had too much bread and not enough sandwich contents. The mushroom & hummus sandwich came with a SURPRISE EGGPLANT. I feel like there was more eggplant than mushroom, and instead should've been called \"eggplant sandwich with mushroom and hummus.\" I'm not mad at it though because I love eggplant, but just a warning for those of you who are expecting mushrooms and hummus and end up with an eggplant too.",

    "text": "**Review is for the Boulangerie** Found myself daydreaming about food (surprise, surprise) - specifically Balthazar's hazelnut rocher. It's been a while, but I still think back to my halcyon summer of snagging a fresh lemon tart or fluffy croissant each morning. Balthazar (the restaurant proper) and their adjacent Boulangerie are stationed in bustling Covent Garden. The restaurant remains woefully out of my price range, so the bakery became my preferred haunt. Grab one of their canary-yellow boxes, load up on some heavenly carbs, and resist the urge to eat them until you arrive at your dining location. The shop has great versatility - everything from fresh loaves of French bread (served with giant butter pats) to whimsical, fist-sized meringues. The bread is good stuff. Full stop. Soft, warm, and perfectly crisped. Grab a loaf, head to a market for some cured meats or lox, and make some causal tartines in a local park. I've never regretted doing so. My favourite desserts were the chocolate hazelnut rocher and their lemon tart. Likely in my top 5 pastries ever consumed to date? The richness and texture of the rocher's mousse was remarkable. Think a Ferrero Rocher but ten times the size, softer, and far more rich. Needless to say, the first time I tried one I was back the next day for a repeat experience. As for the lemon tart it has a thick, eggy curd. Many tarts I've had in the US suffer from that artificial gelatine-based filling (you can't even really call it a curd), but Balthazar's tastes like true sugared lemon. Their oversized macarons - almost comparable in size to a hamburger - are adorable, but just a tad saccharine for my tastes. The flourless chocolate cake sphere was like pure cocoa magma and sensationally rich. It's heaven in there. Didn't know there's a sister location in NYC, so my mouth is watering at the prospect at having some Balthazar bread and sweeties within (conceivable) driving distance.",

We hadn't seen each other for years so he let us catch up a bunch and was nice about the fact that we hadn't even opened our menus the first two times he came around. I had the Rocket and Spinach Agnolotti as an entree. Loved the bitterness of the arugula and the simple flavors worked well together. The hazelnut also added a nice tough. It seemed unnecessary oily though and felt heavy in my tummy. My friend and I then split the Creme Brulee. Good thing we did because it was massive. I enjoyed the sugary crust but the rest of it was just okay. It could've been creamier and more flavorful. \u00a0We left around 10 PM and there were way more people than when we got here.

We had a round booth table, the restaurant was beautifully decorated with tons of staff. Our waiter immediately got us water, coffee and iced tea. I ordered poached eggs with smoked salmon. The homemade English muffin was delicious, the salmon was fresh, and the eggs were perfectly cooked. I was able to get the hollandaise sauce on the side. Overall, great meal, excellent service in a prime location.",

Everything was excellent and the service was great too. As soon as I sat down the waiter asked if I wanted a glass of wine and he gave it to me on the house! The restaurant itself is in a nice area and the inside looks just like the New York location. It also wasn't overly expensive which I appreciated since I was on a business trip. Remains one of my favorites!!",

First, he made an absolutely impeccable martini, and even paused to inquire about my preferred dryness. It was wonderful. I noted the wonderful lemon presence, and he cut a fresh lemon peel and squeezed it over the back of my hand to show me the freshness of lemon oils and the difference they make. Then, when I expressed an interest in the vermouth he used, he very enthusiastically shared their house blend (cocchio + standard dry). I mentioned I'd never heard of cocchio, and what followed was a tour de force of making a guest feel special -- he personally walked me through the different kinds of vermouth cocchio makes, their characteristics, their history, their relationship to other aperitifs like Lillet --\u00a0and then he gave me a taste of each. I mean, not only did I have a great time, enjoy a spectacular martini (and a perfect rare steak frites), but I actually learned something that I can bring home with me. I will consider my next trip to London incomplete without a visit to Balthazar for a drink with Sam. Sam, you are a gentleman and a scholar. Thanks for a great evening!",

We've eaten here before, as well as \u00a0dining at the original NYC location, and have always had a nice time and decent food. The scallops were a fine starter, and the onion soup was classic. Both Lamb and steak frites were tasty if perhaps unmemorable. Service is fine but can get a bit thin if the place fills up. We prefer to sit at the banquette tables overlooking all the action ( there wasn't much this visit ), though the padded seat is getting a bit lumpy. Many diners prefer the closer together tables in the middle of the classic bistro space. We have spotted the occasional celebrity here but most diners are having pre and post theatre dinners. Great Covent Garden location.",

Had read negative professional reviews in the papers and was hesitant to try it, but so glad I took the plunge.Pros: Lovely ambiance (similar to Delaunay), excellent front of house staff, excellent waitstaff. Asked to have table changed during a busy lunch hour as wanted more privacy for a lunch meeting and was accommodated immediately and gracefully. Plats du jour are an excellent deal. Food is consistent, menu is varied, pricing very reasonable for quality of food. Balthazar house salad had just the perfect touch of truffle oil and seasonal ingredients. Mains are superb. Even the bread basket offers a step up from the standard dry baguette that one finds elsewhere. And the takeaway bakery next door is charming.Cons: Forced to come up with something, simply that there can be a bit of wait it seems others have discovered this gem as well!",

All booked up.Just so happens we had tickets for Charlie and the chocolate factory at Drury Lane on Thursday. 7.30 kick off. Balthazar right outside. Why not try a pre-theatre raid.A 6pm table of 3 was duly booked. We got there on time and the place was already busy. The bar was full and three quarters of the tales were taken. Bags were swiftly taken and we were at our table.Balthazar London feels exactly the same as New York. Loud. Thronging. hot. Nicely decked out in authentic French brasserie tiling and furniture. Serving staff whizz round all over the gaff and there is a big seafood bar at the back to whet the appetite. This is proper tourist London stuff, and I don't mean that in a bad way. Slap bang in the middle of covent garden and full of hip things out for a good time. It feels great.The menu is what you'd expect from a good French brasserie. Nice bread arrived to munch on, plenty of it. Followed by a good moules et frites which was lifted by the inclusion of caramelised fennel. The boy had macaroni cheese sans the bacon and the missus had a skirt steak that was full of taste. My chip were a little soggy was my only complaint on the food. But it was pretty expensive for what we got I thought.However, you're paying for the great atmosphere, not the food. And for a bit of a treat if you're painting good old London Town red, it's definitely got it. Go there and show out. It's fun. Not perfect food and a bit pricey but great fun nonetheless. Not quite a 4 but a high 3 stars well earned.Nb If I did theatre reviews I Would give Charlie and the chocolate factory 6 stars. It was truly brilliant. And I hate the theatre. \u00a0Book it. And try Balthazar before for a proper night out!The place was heaving by the time we left at 7. So do book.",

Balthazar, which looks and feels identical to her sibling across the Atlantic, fits this niche perfectly. The food is well executed (the Huevos Rancheros were delicious during my visit this weekend), the staff attentive, the room well decorated, the sound level loud without being deafening.

It had a buzzy atmosphere at 5pm and we ordered drinks whilst we waited for our table. I had an Aperol spritz which was watery and rather expensive for 9.50 but we perused the menu which sounded good and got shown to a nice corner table. This is where it all started to unravel. The wine list is ludicrously expensive and we ordered two half bottles as the house wines did not appeal. I ordered saffron risotto to start which had 1.1/2 (!) scallops on the top. It arrived with a skin on it so had either been sat waiting to be served or had been microwaved to high heaven. My boyfriend's game pate was not pate, more like a thick over seasoned terrine. Bread was a little stale and butter ice cold. My main was 1/2 a lobster which arrived served on a bed of ice with no fork or cracker to open it. Every time I tried to get some flesh out it was submerged in a slushy, icy bath and it felt like I got an 1/8 of a lobster! Pretty revolting and served with what appeared to be Heinz seafood sauce. My boyfriend's duck shepherd's pie was greasy, small and swimming in fat. All in all the bill came to \u00a3160 which we certainly anticipated, but for this price range you would expect high quality French food. We will not be returning, considering brasserie Zedel is not too far away and has a far more spectacular ambience for half the price I cannot believe Balthazar gets away with the terrible expensive food it has to offer. Please save your money and go elsewhere! London has so much more to offer than this overpriced mediocrity!",

Girlfriend had the eggs royale, I had the eggs hussard both of which were absolutely delicious. Afterwards we shared the waffles which were a bit dry and didn't come with enough berry sauce to make a difference. Staff very helpful again though and brought a generous serving of chocolate sauce on the side. Menu a bit boring but exactly what you would expect from a bistro brunch. Great service. Most food excellent. Highly recommended.",

Our waiter was knowledgable about the specials and was helpful without being too pushy. The restaurant itself is grand. High ceilings, chandeliers, wine bottles were lined up on the wall of the bar, and a plethora of fresh oysters and shrimp were displayed on ice. I started off with a chicken liver/foie gras appetizer. Very generous portions and tasty. For the main, I ordered the grilled dover sole and it was perfectly cooked! My friends ordered the lobster spaghetti, salmon, and steak frites and they all enjoyed their dishes as well. If I wasn't a broke college student, I would have ordered the chocolate souffle for dessert-- it sounded divine!Balthazar is a great place to people watch and treat yourself. The ambience is ornate, the service is wonderful and prompt. A little pricy, but I'd definitely come back!",

    "text": "*Bolsheviks beware, seriously bourgeois review is brewing along with the coffee*______________Sometimes I just love being bourgeois.Frothy coffee and pricey pastries quelquefois, really is the only way to start the day, darling.If, like myself you were sheepishly excited at the expansion of Keith McNally's faux-Fran\u00e7ais New York establishment into exciting new territory (London), yet were NOT terribly thrilled about the prospect of hitting redial on the phone every minute for three days in vain expectation of securing a dining reservation (I mean I have so many better things to do with my precious bourgeois time, right) the Balthazar Bakery located right next the the restaurant proper may be a nice solution for a coy little indulgence - experience the atmosphere sans the wait.Having lived a block away from the original restaurant-bakery duet in Soho NYC (I know, how bourgeois), I was of course excited to relive my (occasional) self-spoiling mornings and thus decided to breakfast \u00e0 la Balthazar aujourd'hui. I was not disappointed. In fact, I was exuberantly delighted to sample their twist on a classic croque monsieur [soused in b\u00e9chamel-sauce finished with Lea-and-Perrins lacerations]- the textural experience was sumptuously akin to that initial and rather glorious creme-caramel fracturing moment. I'm afraid biting through the crispy, grilled bread surface into the soft layering of jambon et fromage interior, is simply worth the excessive \u00a34.50 it demands.Bien s\u00fbr, the usual boulangerie window-pageant of baked goods is certainly inviting, and the gleaming white-tiled walls bedecked with cursive 'B'-inscribed wholemeal loaves exude a constructed charm one only thought possible in a Hollywood studio (you have ACTUALLY been to Paris, yah). Though I would even be so bold as to suggest that the B-B London even trumps its NYC predecessor in terms of the open space and ability to convince its patrons that they are actually there to shop (market-style) rather than just queuing for a costly caffeine and butter-filled petit d\u00e9jeuner, distributed in a somewhat nonchalant and brusque manner (although that would probably be the most authentically French thing about it).Bon appetit, comrades.",

After we walked in and were seated I managed to glimpse so amazing dishes which made me think twice about the original plan. I ended up going for the burger. Cooked to preference, with a great homemade sauce and bun. It also came swimming in a sea of French fries. Normally I wouldn't complain but maybe it was a bit too much as I don't like to waste food. My partner stuck to the original plan and got a cheese omelette. I tried this also but it was overly cheese and quite small. Coffee was also top notch.

    "text": "Happy dance for one of my favorite NYC staples making its way to London!For the entire three years that I've been living in London, I've been hearing rumblings of the prodigal son, Keith McNally bringing his French brasserie juggernaut across the Atlantic. And with much fanfare and panache, the will-he-won't-he speculation finally ended last Monday evening. They're currently only open for dinner service, but brunch and lunch service is coming soon. After 137 tries (thanks, iPhone for keeping track) to get through the booking line last Friday morning, my fortitude was rewarded with an opening week dinner spot. So, last night we sat down for an early-ish dinner, that is very much what I remember from back home. The staff is an eclectic mix of London's restaurant service elite; NYC Balthazar linchpins; and an eclectic mix of French servers representing the best of The Hexagon's diverse regions. It's an impressive bunch! The American hospitality smacks you in the face as soon as you walk through the door. At first blush, it can be a bit much for those of us used to the cold shoulder presented at so many London establishments. But we acclimated almost immediately--it sort of made me miss home. Sigh.Water appeared via busboy -- what!?. Our Breton waiter brought us expertly made cocktails (Brian and Tom were both poached from other top London cocktail establishments). Fine de Claires on-the-half-shell were ordered and brought in a flash. Briny and fresh, I was in heaven. Bread from their boulangerie next door was devoured with French butter (of course). I started with the onion soup, which was unctuous and just a little bit sweet. The hubs had a small portion of the beef tartare, which he figures is some of the best he's ever eaten--and he eats it a lot. Another member of the waitstaff recommended a bottle of red from the Jura, her home turf, that was one of the more interesting bottles of wine I've ever had. Slightly effervescent and light in color, it takes a couple of sips to fall in love, but amazing once you get there.It accompanied the whole chicken for two very well. The chicken itself was roasted to perfection and served with jus, a mix of veg, and velvety potato puree. By this point we were stuffed to the gills, but dessert was needed--for research purposes obviously. I ordered the tart du jour, lemon with a raspberry reduction. Lemon tart is my Achilles heel as of late, and this one was very good. Although, it was more of a lemon mousse with crust, than a lemon tart. Even so, still delicious! My partner in crime had the cheesecake. It was a small portion, but it was so rich, there was no reason for more than they served. He nearly licked the plate clean. My only complaint at this point is the timing is a bit off. The coffee came before we had finished our dessert, and after presenting us with the whole chicken, it went back into the kitchen for plating for what seemed like an eternity; I think it was actually more like 15 minutes in human time. But it's their first week, so I imagine things will get smoother with time. For those of you who've fallen for the New York Balthazar, you'll recognize the room as an almost exact replica. Other brilliant American aspects include walk-in seating at the bar, the seafood tower, and a true New Yawka working the door. Did I mention the busboys? Oh, and how could I forget? It's reasonably priced; I mean, for Central London anyway.Yes, as my husband said, it seems like the universe is finally throwing us a bone on the London dining scene. I think a standing weekend reservation may be in order.",

As brunch goes I wold recommend the Moules Frites. The mussel portions are very generous (I was full before I got to the fries). However the fries are more crunch than substance and a thicker cut (if going off the french fry vibe a little) would make them even better.

I'm sure it would be a very ''chic'' place, there is no other word but chic for this place, to hang out for brunch on Sundays. But I was not impressed with the food selection nor the quality of the seafood. The chairs also had no cushions on them so you were sat in this hard wooden chair for the entire evening which makes your bum sore and your skirt sticking to the back of your legs. The tables were tiny and they tried to squeeze as much cutlery, bread plates, bread baskets, glasses and what have you, on this tiny (again hard topped) table. There were also A LOT of tables crammed into the whole place, as if the proprietors were trying to simulate a cosy, vintage style, caf\u00e9 atmosphere....but actually, to me, did nothing more than to increase the noise levels and made everthing appear very messy.....Verdict - dislike!",

    "text": "Well get that dialing finger at the ready because you're going to need to book ahead. This isn't a 'let's wander around Covent Garden and see what we find' kind of place, but once you're in, you'll be glad you did. The service is very American, which is lovely and refreshing at times, it's nice to be a bit catered to by an army of staff. The decor, like everyone has noted, is a replica of the NY one with loads of French charm. We did a brunch and aside from one of the best bloody marys I've had, the food was pretty epic. An eggs benedict that will not leave you feeling peckish afterwards.. oysters, baked mac & cheese, souffl\u00e9... you can easily go overboard with the decadence meter but you'll have to do it sometime, no?There's a bakery attached where you can take away some of the tempting sweets and fresh breads. It's a must stop for anyone that loves eating, you'll agonize over what to order and end up getting the entire menu like we did. It's not totally overpriced either, for what you get it's actually quite reasonable.",
