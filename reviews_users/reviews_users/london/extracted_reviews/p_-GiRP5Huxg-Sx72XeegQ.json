I couldn't have asked for a better venue to lose my karaoke cherrystaff were friendly and welcoming, drinks were well priced considering the area and the cocktails are potent enough to put the malotov variety to shame. The private karoake booths seemed a bit of a wierd concept - but after the 80's pub quiz (we definitely could have benefited from having some, ahem, older people on our team), not to mention a few of the afore-said cocktails, the genius of the idea dawned on me. Although there were a few strangers in the room, I had indulged in enough liquid courage to hijack the mic. There's also no using that old excuse of Oh they don't have any songs I like so I'm gonna sit this round out Nahuh. Think of a song you would do Karaoke. They have it. They also have the two cover versions and the one-hit wonder from the lead singers solo project. If you can find a song you wanna sing that they don't have, I will buy you a beer myself. Would definitely reccommend Lucky Voice for a good night and a laugh with some mates. I will be back, once my voice has recovered",

I'm not the most confident singer in the world so I spent some quality time in the rather gorgeous main bar drinking their amazingly yummy cocktails. Fruity and long, I managed 3 before I was finally dragged off into one of the rooms. These aren't any old karaoke rooms. They're dark and sultry with long leather(ish) sofa's. Above you is a patterned ceiling which I at first hoped was a depiction of pac man but turned out to be hearts and crosses. The singing itself was a blast. With golden oldies such as Grease and current hits like Gaga's Bad Romance, the sound quality was a lot better than the singing. The best bit? The dress up box brought to the room by our ever-smiling waitress. Inside were two wigs (one pink!), a toy microphone and two BLOW UP GUITARS! Clearly a step up from air guitar. Would I go again? Definitely, particularly since I discovered this morning they also run Cocktail Masterclasses. Any excuse for a party.",

I had been there before, but only this time I could have the whole karaoke experience and was as a karaoke should be: really fun. I was really surprise with the range of songs, that goes from classic 80's to current TV shows' tunes (they have a Glee set). In our booth you could hear from Total Eclipse of Heart to Flight of the Conchords' Most Beautiful Girl in the Room, all intensely sung. Even if you're not keen about karaoke I'm pretty sure their amazing cocktails (they all seem very sweet from the menu, but once you try they're just perfect) and shots will worth the effort to hear you're friends loosing their voices all night long.

Even though our popularity could have outdone us, nobody seemed all too upset at not having a table to huddle around and look serious while answering the quiz questions. Mainly, everyone was too busy dancing and singing along to the snippets of songs, getting a little bit upset as each one finished but restarting with renewed vigour every time the next snippet started. The atmosphere was great and it is due in part to the staff here, who aren't just good at their jobs, they actually seem that they are hugely enjoying themselves. That's enough to get any party started. The drinks are great - Asahi on tap (but only in half pints), decent cocktails for \u00a37, a great lot of spirits that I can't remember being too expensive. er. Having not actually done any karaoke, Lucky Voice will have to rest on its four-starred laurels until I return to do some to see if it is deserved",

I left what little pride and street-cred I had at the door and gazed upon the shocked faces of my friends as I foghorned my way through Whitney Houston and Chicago, via the Prodigy. Happily, they wailed along to even more embarrassing tunes in return, so at least what happened in that private room will stay there - an uneasy truce between Karaoke sinners, if you will. Oh, and the sound system rocked. Lucky Voice is the closest I've come to the KTV experiences I've had in Shanghai, except the keyboard wasn't all in Mandarin Chinese, it was a touch screen where you could search by artist or song. Although not the cheapest karaoke around, the friendly staff and ample drink choices make it a great night out for a special treat.

It also proved to be a learning experience as I know know that You're So Vain is the only [Carly Simon] song that mentions the Canadian province of Nova Scotia For the reluctant singers, not that there will be any by the end of the night, there's a helpful book of lists: Songs for Low Voices; Hits of the 80s; Showtunes etc and the props like the blow up guitar and glitter cowboy hats all got a turn.

The cocktails were around \u00a37 so it's not overly expensive either, no more than you'd pay along the rest of Upper Street. The booths are great fun. So many karaoke places has rubbish videos along with the questionable versions of the songs, so it was nice to get something a bit more authentic. I really should know better than to go to those rubbish places in Leicester Square. Some things I've discovered: After a few drinks it's impossible not to sing along.I knock out a pretty good power ballad.I shouldn't stay out until 3am when I have work to do the next day.Karaoke gives you a hangover.

Qype held another of its famous events last night: karaoke singing (london.blog.qype.com/?p=\u2026) at Lucky Voice (bars.luckyvoice.com/kara\u2026) in Islington. Arranged by the fab Siany (qype.co.uk/people/Siany) , there were roughly 10 people in a room that was undoubtedly the loudest in the place. Those who know me know I don't mind belting out a tune if the time is right. Somehow I ended singing (although most songs were group singalongs anyhow) \"Welcome to the Jungle\" by G'n'R, \"Break On Through\" by The Doors, \"Jump\" by Van Halen, \"Baby Got Back\" by Sir Mix-A-Lot, \"Lady is a Tramp\" by Frank Sinatra, \"Back In Black\" by AC/DC and \"Word Up\" by Cameo. I'm not really looking forward to the pictures. Though, having just come from work and still in my suit, I think I raised the tone. Well, until \"Baby Got Back\" anyway. Super fun, though, with a good karaoke system and lots of songs to choose from. Doesn't seem to be a cheap place to drink, so watch yourself. It's a classy bar, though, with a really nice set of sofas and chairs and pavement tables out front. It's a great spot for a gang of friends to have an immense laugh.",

It's way better (read: more spacious) than the Soho location (which in all honestly I also love). Good song catalogue, fairly decent service (but expensive beer - oi!) and a swanky, comfortable bar/lounge area all add to the wonder that is a private karaoke experience.  Great place for a Par-tay (great excuse for one too).",

    "text": "\"You have the voice of an angel. Your voice is like a combination of Fergie and Jesus\" Whilst this could be said for myself it is sadly not true, but more so than my friend Lucy, who sounded like she was killing a pterodactyl. Following on from the escapades at The Castle on Pentonville Road (which is excellent by the way), on Easter Sunday we inevitably head for Lucky Voice in Angel. It's a fantastic night out and considering I could barely speak we still had a incredible night. For two hours of what is basically shouting at a screen, it will set you back about 15 squirrels, but what will really sting you is the drinks. \u00a0Partly because you are generally so smashed you should probably just go directly to the hospital, but also because you are having a such a good time you fail to check that a bottle of rum will set you back a small fortune. To be honest providing you can get past this, don't go there mid-month, you will be fine and you can concentrate all your efforts on blasting out 'Born to Run' at the top of your voice. The staff are also legends for putting up with us or more specifically Lucy. I do hope we didn't make them too angry... more so on the basis that we'll be rocking it again next year. I think they do food there, but let's face it you're not there for that. If you want to rock out in one for the best places in London to do Karaoke, then look no further than the Lucky Voice in Angel. Why specifically this one? Easy. They give you props to dress up with and make those post night out photos even better. I have no criticisms purely on the basis that it is such a fun night out, you'll need to take a change of pants due to all the excitement. Get. Involved.",

    "text": "I didn't do very much singing at the Qype event last night, as I was with a friend whom I had to 'bribe' just to get to the venue. We spent some time at the bar just chatting and playing with Microsoft's Ben's HTC phone, so I can testify to the incredibly wide selection of drinks and rather plush seating area at the front of the bar. Microsoft's Diane also mentioned that the new Windows 7 phone should be out before Christmas, so that's one to keep an eye out for as well. That being said, I did venture into one of the three rooms to participate in a song. I'd been to a Lucky Voice-powered karaoke bar before so am familiar with the wide range of songs available. It's really very impressive, and, in my humble opinion, could rival the karaoke bars back in Asia. You can even check out the songlist online and plan out your songlist even before getting to the bar, which is something I like to do, being such a closet mad karaoke fiend. The accessories - wigs, inflatable guitars and hats - are definitely a great touch. I can definitely say I witnessed one of the best karaoke performances ever in the form of Chris and some of the other male Qypers doing Salt & Pepa's Push It with an incredible amount of gusto. Awesome. Truly mind-blowing. And definitely a you-had-to-be-there moment... unless one of the other Qypers filmed it? ;)",

You can also turn the voice/backing/echo/reverb up and down which is very handy. There's a button in your room so staff can be called on for drinks which is very fancy and they provide a box of amusing dressing up props. The only criticisms I would have is the slightly claustrophobic underground nature of their rooms and their bizarrely high levels of air-conditioning. That and some of their backing tracks and on-screen lyrics are dodgy (strange midi files for Bonnie Tyler and ridiculous rewriting of ruder Lady Gaga lyrics) but all in all the experience is great and this is a must for karaoke fans!",

Donning a blonde Bon Jovi-esque wig we ran through a demanding repertoire in booth 1, the boys duetting rhythmically with the girls, harmoniously in the first 20 minutes before it all got rather rowdy and the 'uncle at a wedding' dance moves busted out their seams.

But after last night I can't wait to go back to Lucky Voice! We were welcomed by the friendly and very helpful Lucky Voice staff and served a fantastic array of canapes and drinks. Comfortably seated, watered and fed, we had My Kind of Phone's Diane give us the low down on the innovative and intuitive new Windows Mobile 7. I have to say, if this new OS is in reality, as good as it sounded last night, I'll no longer be a slave to apple! Full on canapes and tech speak, my friends and I made our way to one of Lucky Voices's Karaoke booths. To our delight, we found a box containing wigs, a hat and a tambourine and having adorned ourselves with them, began our attempt at reaching notes that would leave us voiceless by the end of the night. We had some trouble with one of the mics, but without leaving the booth and with the press of a button were able to summon a staff member who happily rectified the problem. And just like that, we were also able to order more drinks too. My friends and I had a fantastic night and we all want to go back to Lucky voice soon!",

    "text": "And to think I nearly braved going home to get some hats and tashes - private booth karaoke becomes extremely special when you have a 'thirsty' button with a useful waitress who appears in the blink of an eye and a box of dress-up paraphernalia. Now I likes me some Karaoke, it's true. In the past I was used to seedy PA systems at restaurants, caterwauling on street corners and even whispered lullabies to sleeping babes (none of mine own). Nothing prepares you for a private session though, in luxurious surroundings, with a fully stocked and prepared cocktail bar with delightful canap\u00e9s and such friendly and charming hosts. My visit to the Islington branch of Lucky Voice was courtesy of Qype and Windows 7 Mobile and possibly I wouldn't have ventured so far north to check out this venue. After spending a roaring night of rapping, singing and laughing I have so many good memories that I really would consider dragging my pals to do it, not because the central London venue is booked. Even when I wandered away from the bar to munch on more Hoisin Duck pancakes (folded elegantly like a seaside chip wrapper cone) to find my Mohito delivered to a charming young lady, nothing bothered the bar staff. He was already making a replacement for me, rather then leave it to melt on the bar edge - a sign of good training and thoughtfulness. Being of Mediterranean blood, I tend to generate enough heat to power a small island and I would have preferred more air-conditioning in the booths - not to say it's rubbish - but as I danced more and got even hotter, I felt the need to take the occasional mulligan in the sumptuous bar area to cool down at times. Aside from that, top times all round!",

The black and pink theme is a total winner and In this branch they have a super cool and area with a dj and leather sofas, so it's perfect for a few drinks before you do karaoke. The cocktail menu is song themed, which is a cute idea! A particular favourite of mine is the Phil raspberry Collins which is stoli vodka with raspberries and soda.. Simple yet delicious! If you're going lucky voice the cocktails are quite pricey, so come for happy when it's 2-4-1. \u00a0If you're doing karaoke, you get your own private room and you can order cocktails and food to the room.

The desk staff were very patient with us while our group decided who was up for booking the room and who didn't want to, in the end about seven of us paid separately per person for two hours (\u00a322 each) and were shown to our room.The staff are very patient and I can only apologise to the lady who was trying to talk us through how it all worked while my friends excitedly whooped and screeched over her (not on purpose I hasten to add!)The rooms are clean and modern, with a chest full of accessories to play with like wigs, blow up guitars etc. There is a button you can press for drinks orders or help. The song choice is vast, pretty much any band or artist I could think of was on their easy to use system. We drank prosecco at \u00a335 a bottle, which is reasonable for a place like this I think - I just wish I didn't drink so much of it! My head AND wallet hurt the next day, especially as we were having so much fun we booked another hour.The only thing I would ask of Lucky Voice would be a price list on display or easier to find on their website. It was easy to get carried away and book another hour when there was just three of us left, had I known would have been charged the same rate as it was for seven people (\u00a377) I probably wouldn't have done so. We paid per person originally so assumed it would be the same for an extra hour but perhaps the rates go up after a certain time. Like I say, a rates card or display would be helpful on these occasions as I did feel slightly ripped off when I checked the receipt the next day. My own fault for drinking too much prosecco and not clarifying with the staff on the payment desk though.",

    "text": "So there was a Yelp event organised by Tristan J and Ashley, who are key workers, which means - on Sundays and Mondays, you get the room for free, as long as you spend \u00a340 on drinks (includes the \u00a320 deposit). \u00a0We had an amazingly fun time, the rooms were large, clean and spacey, and filled with jumbo blow-up mics, saxophones, funny hats and tambourines for laughs. \u00a0The drinks were tasty, and they were on for 2-for-1 before 8pm, so I filled up! \u00a0Otherwise, cocktails are around \u00a39, and Asahi beer is \u00a34. \u00a0If you're hungry, I remember seeing pizzas for \u00a38.The songs can be searched on their touch screen, but no catalogues! \u00a0I love the planet, and I love trees - but sometimes you just need to flip through a catalogue before you find \"that\" song.. the \"ohmygodyouguysssssssssssssss!!!\" song that kicks everyone back 10-20 years to reminisce on the good old times.The screen just shows the words, and no cheesy budget videos playing in the background. \u00a0I usually find those vids annoying, but after looking at a screen full of words, I realise that cheesy vids ARE essential!While they do have a good song list, it needs improvement. \u00a0Couldn't find a few things.. 3 doors down, third eye blind, certain TLC hits to name a few.. I can think of a number of other places that have a greater selection. \u00a0So - 4 stars on the Yelp event experience (free room, and 2-for-1 drinks). \u00a0Otherwise, if I had to pay for the room - I would probably go elsewhere, mainly because of the song selection, and my preference to be able to look through a catalogue at the same time.",

    "text": "I had never been to a karaoke bar where they have rooms! It's very cool and private. There were about ten of us in the room. It was neat to be able to see the queue of music, and to be able to end your song if it was going on forever. No KJ was super okay! The staff here was very attentive to our drink needs. Next time I come here I'm hoping to not have a cold because that makes singing a bit easier. I would recommend coming with a larger group because I imagine it would be a little bit weird with less people. Only complaint--one of the mics didn't work as well as the other.",

    "text": "I'm going to be honest - while I love karaoke in theory, the reality of holding a mic fills me with dread! It's the equivalent of the fear you feel where you dream you've forgotten you have a big exam or you've left the house naked.As I made my way to Lucky Voice I comforted myself with the knowledge that I didn't have to sing if I didn't want to and I was sure there would be people eager to fill the void.Lucky Voice comprises of a bar and a few small rooms for karaoke. You book as a group and have the room to yourself with a computerised karaoke machine to select your songs. There are plenty of songs to choose from but they also have a smaller catalogue of popular songs and it categorises them beautifully...my favourite category being 'Songs for Non-Singers'. Bingo!I felt I should brave the mic for at least one song and so opted for the backing vocals on the 'Shoop Shoop Song' (wimp!), however I soon learnt that at Lucky Voice, and in the confines of your private room, the mic isn't essential to have a jolly old time and a fantastic sing-a-long.Singers and screechers alike can have a really great time here, you'll only be amongst friends and even if the mic isn't in your hand you can guarantee you'll be singing along with the best of them anyway.I'm sold - sign me up for the next karaoke night, I feel a song coming on!",

    "text": "This is a pretty decent, well-laid out Karaoke bar, with the bar out at the front and several private karaoke rooms in the back. Probably the most amazing thing about this place though is their 'book a room for two hours free of charge' deal on Monday for key workers (thanks Tristan!), which also concides with a laudable 2 for 1 deal on cocktails and draft Asahi. This meant that the cost of two hours of karaoke and two pints of Asahi came to just \u00a34.50 - incredible value.I'm giving it four stars rather than five because the song catalogue is not as good as other places I've been to, focussing primarily on out-and-out karaoke classics. There is the odd exception to this - I was surprised to see Bloc Party's 'Flux' on the song list - but generally the more indie and alternative, the much less likely you are to find it here.Overall though, a lot of fun, and excellent value if you can find a key worker to take with you on Monday evenings.",

    "text": "There are two kinds of Karaoke bars, the ones where people sing to the entire bar, friends and strangers alike, and the ones where you seclude yourselves in a closed off room to avoid humiliation. \u00a0I prefer the former, \u00a0the entertainment value of watching drunk strangers butcher the old favorites can't be overestimated, but also because the latter often winds up being a cold white walled prison room, no liquor license with a qiant crt-tv from the early 80's your only companion. \u00a0 Well, Lucky Voice breaks this mold by having state of the art touch-sensitive controls, a great flat screen, props to use, glowy padded benches reminiscent of a Virgin Atlantic flight, and alcohol service that is fast and efficient (but not cheap). \u00a0So, although I'd still rather be watching a whole room of singing drunks, being with a small group of friends playing karoake (for those without your xbox equivalent) couldn't get better than here. \u00a0The outside bar looked equally modern and attractive for drinks, as well, if the traditional pub decor of other places is getting old to you.",
