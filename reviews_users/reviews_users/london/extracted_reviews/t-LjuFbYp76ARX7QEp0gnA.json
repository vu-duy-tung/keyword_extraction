This trip took us 2 buses from Waterloo but it was an adorable place. I was a little disappointed as the night we were there the only \"pie\" available was a chicken and leek pie and I so badly wanted a real British pie for dinner but the Cottage/Shepards Pie was delicious. The dessert of sticky toffee pudding was also delicious. We live in California and I grew up in South Africa. We do not get meat pies in California. I was hoping to have at least one pie in England. The closest I got was a M&S sausage roll from Waterloo Station. The dinner however was delicious and the place is so adorable and full of locals.",

Out comes my phone's yelp app for some fish n chips nearby. Closest pub in the neighborhood, check. Cool dark friendly pub with business men (seriously Mr Monopoly was sitting next to us doing a crossword) and locals and friendly gold toothed bar maid making it outstanding. FOOD! Turns out this place is known for its pies. And they do look tasty. But we order the haddock and it is crunchy (able to withstand all the lemon and vinegar slathers you can shake at it) and the tartare sauce is just right. Definitely cool hidden place that I will come back to reveal to more american tourists. But don't worry, I'll blindfold them for the journey or something. BEER! They have guest cask beers that rotate monthly and have a taster paddle. A pound something each for 3, 1/3 pint tasters of the guest casks. ROOM!? There's an upstairs \"pie room\" which seems like a private room. Went on a monday afternoon and it didn't look open, not sure if you can just go up whenever.",

We were as delighted to find The Windmill as Lawrence of Arabia no doubt was to find Omar Sharif when he lost his way in a parallel universe. The Windmill makes some bold claims in the form of banners from the Institute of Pie Excellence saluting its steak and kidney pies. My chaps and I were not here for the food, however, and embarked on a swift couple of Guinnesses so no report can be given on the grub. This venue is large and was remarkably quiet for a Saturday afternoon. There is also an excellent view of a rubber-wear shop next door where the clientele will provide much merriment if it is to be found in short supply with your comrades. Paddyman's verdict? A relief after the touristic nightmare of the Coach and Horses, this pub has some amusing pictures in its toilets (a big fan of this) which more than compensated for the \"haven't-quite-worked-out-how-to-clean-the-bogs-since-the-smoking-ban\" whiff around and about the gents.

This is an unassuming pub right behind the main shopping street of Piccadilly Circus so it is an ideal place to stop by after a long day of shopping. The place is filled with locals and I felt like the only tourist there. I hope this Yelp review doesn't ruin that. There is plenty of seating but we sat in the main room. The terrace and meat pie rooms also looked great. We ordered the steak and ale pie and the steak and kidney pie. Both were amazing. Don't ruin them with gravy, the gravy inside was incredible and even better spread on the mash that comes on the side. The tap selection was typical for London pubs and the prices quite reasonable. I will definitely be recommending this place to all my friends when they visit London and I can't wait to go back!",

Now that I've thoroughly dated myself with that reference, I'll say that the Windmill lives up to its claim as being the best place in the area for pies. We had some drinks at the bar/outside and later came in and found a seat in \"Pie Room Too\" and ordered. Around the table there were choices of chicken/leek, steak/mushroom, haloumi, & one other. Everyone loved the pies. I had the steak & mushroom and it was delish! I'd have rather gotten chips than mashed potatoes, but forgot to order that way. No problem, though. The pie pastry was very nice and the seasoning just scrumptious. I'll definitely keep The Windmill in mind for a nice pub meal when I'm out shopping, etc.",

A local, he directed us back past the Apple Store to the Windmill as the best pub in the area for a pint. Following his directions led us to this wonderful pie shop restaurant with a few drafts on offer. We ended up with two pints of a real ale called Milkwood, which was oddly produced by Brains brewery. I might have to steal one of these glasses that says \"Brains\" on it.Good service, the very loud bell rang at 10:50 with an apology for last call and then again 10 minutes later.They have a fruit machine that was loudly being used for a trivial pursuit / battleship game by a bunch of shirt and tie folks when we got in, it got a bit quieter so we could actually hear outselves talk.",

I have eaten in the sister restaurant The Ginea Grill a few times and have tried the steak and mushroom pie there, so I was very excited about coming here.We tried to order some Oysters, they only had seven remaining and had to ask the chef if they could sell us all seven as they usually only sell them in threes. I was wondering what they would do with the one left over if they refused to sell it to us! The french oysters were excellent, just not enough of them. We also ordered some prawn fish cakes which were excellent. Onto the main courses, this time I tried the steak and kidney pie. This has won three awards previously as the best pie in London, and I can see why. The pie was excellent, the pastry, the meat...I was asked to complete a feedback card at the end, my comments were they shouldn't change a thing. It was perfect. For sides I tried the mash and mushy pea's. the peas were good, however the mash potato was a bit dry.Overall I enjoyed this experience. I will come back and dine again. The reason for the four stars and not five, the oyster incident with the waitress and the restaurant only having seven remaining (we originally wanted 18)",

    "text": "The Windmill lays claim to the best pies in Central London; thus far I haven't tried anywhere good enough to be even close to disputing this. Their pies ARE top-notch, and the setting really compliments the traditional English pub fare.Pubs in Mayfair (and indeed the surrounding areas of Piccadilly and Soho) tend to be in the same mould: traditional old English style; smaller places on narrow streets, decked in wood panelling, somewhat dark, offering real ales and \"traditional pub food\". Ask anyone what that latter part means, and they'll say one of two things: fish & chips, or pies. Given that proper steak or chicken pies are clearly a staple attraction of a traditional pub & grub establishment, competition for \"the best\" is fierce, and many claim to have it.From what I've experienced, The Windmill does it better than most. It is a favourite here in the office; special occasions and company lunch outings tend to be in this direction; especially to treat out-of-town guests to a good steak pie. Or chicken pie. Or whatever else happens to be on the menu at that time. There is a good selection of pie, and often the specials further add to the list, along with other classic pub menu options such as the aforementioned fish & chips, burgers, and so on. But the pie is their main event; they even call their back restaurant area \"The Pie Room\" and upstairs \"The Pie Room 2\". These settings are typical of the area, far removed from bright windows and drinkers squeezing into the limited outside space - there's a new roof terrace offering a handful of drinkers a little bit of extra room to enjoy sunshine; but big groups are seated indoors. I've had one less-than-ideal experience, owing to a nasty smell emanating from the toilets upstairs, but my other visits have shown that this was a rare accident.Said bigger groups, as we are used to dining in, are well catered for by excellent waiting staff who never miss a beat in terms of being attentive and receiving (and delivering) your order quickly. Bar staff are friendly and will recommend the pick of the week's ales to match your order. If you're only here to drink, it's likely standing room only, and unfortunately it's a tiny street so perhaps is only recommended if there are a handful of folk in your group.The food itself is delicious. I am a huge fan of the steak and mushroom pie; many colleagues prefer the chicken and leek. On our last visit, there was a spicy chicken and chorizo pie on the specials menu, with flaky pastry and humous. Those who tried it, loved it. The pies are generously sized and full of meat; the mash nice and creamy. My order also arrived with a side pot of gravy, which made the mash even nicer. A recommended addition to your pie dish are the \"greens\" - cooked in and served with bacon bits. Deliciously addictive. The only negative I can give on the food side is that it can taste quite salty. Not the healthiest of choices, but if you're not here often it shouldn't do you any harm - it certainly doesn't make it taste bad, unlike some places where the food has been so salty it is inedible.Overall, I like the Windmill. I love having a drink there when it's quiet, though at busy times it's a squeeze. But I love their food, and I think if you do come here for the best pie in London, and get a nice seat, you probably won't be disappointed.",

We ordered a shepard's pie and steak and mushroom pie and they were both delicious. I liked the shepard's pie a little bit more though. They have a good selection of seasonal beer but if you don't know the beers, you'll be blindly picking - although if you ask, they will let you try a little before you choose. Overall, this was a great first meal in London and if I ever go back, will return!",

I proceeded to check where I could find some and then I found this restaurant claiming to have the best. We came in around noon and the place was dead, which was not reassuring since it's prime-time lunch. We stayed anyway and our server was super friendlyShepherd's Pie - Learned that this is served with mashed potatoes and not a crust. The filling was good but I got tired of eating it after a while.Steak & Kidney Pie - Crust stole the show. It was awesome. I definitely enjoyed this more than the Shepherd's Pie. I did not get tired of it and finished this down to the very last crumb.They won an award for their steak & kidney pie so not that surprised that it was much better than the regular shepherd's pie. Cozy spot and good food. Next time I am craving pie in london, this is probably where I will go.",

    "text": "Absolutely fantastic pub dinner! After getting turned away from the place we had originally planned on, the folks walking out behind us recommended The Windmill as a better option, and we were glad we listened! The crowd outside in the street with pints had us worried about the wait for a table as we walked upon, but apparently they were just having a pre-dinner drink, because we were lucky enough to get a table right away (another few minutes and we've have been out of luck though). Definitely a place for local professionals; which meant a bit loud as pints disappeared, but polite. The food was probably the best British food I've ever had actually. The bread, olives, and butter was a nice simple start, and more substantial than we'd expected, but the pies were truly outstanding. The Shepherd's Pie was delicious; a good balance of potato and filling, and the filling itself was rich and flavorful without being too rich or greasy like they can be. I was also impressed with the side of greens, which were somehow cooked to be slightly crispy, but weren't greasy or dried out. Definitely a winning meal, and a place that will be on the top of my list next time I'm in London.",

    "text": "There's others, so make sure you've got the right Windmill! \u00a0This is absolutely the right Windmill. It turned out to be the perfect way to hide away from the snow. My wife and I shared the steak and mushroom pie, and I almost left her so I could spend the rest of my days with the chef, happily being hand-fed pies until gravy flows through my veins and I die of over-consumption. This was a delicious pie, is what I'm telling you. The perfect suet crust filled with a thick beef gravy, big steak chunks, and perfectly cooked (read: not rubber) mushrooms. I never eat mushrooms, but the flavor in this pie was so rich that I would eat anything with this gravy on it. They lost a star because the menu was so limited on our visit. After perusing the menu for a good 5 minutes, we were told the kitchen was down to about 4 items. Also, we ordered chips with our pie, but got mash instead. Did I care? Not once I ladled that gravy over the mash and ate like a fat king. In fact, everything was so delicious that we came back and each got our own pie. \u00a0No sharesies!The beer was a pretty standard selection based on our visit to other pubs. \u00a0I've seen more extensive selections, but they had a good grasp on what the people want, and our server was able to recommend good pairings with the pies.Be aware that this spot gets very busy once work lets out. \u00a0We stopped in around 2, but our second visit was closer to 5 and we had to elbow some people out of the way to get through.Come for the pie, stay for the beer, and leave so you can put on a disguise and come right back to eat another pie without shame.",

It was a pity because we were looking to have some beers and eat some shepherd pies again. Maybe next time we will be with more luck. Cheers mate!",
