    "text": "After all the hype, I was incredibly disappointed by Al Arez. We had just finished the circle line pub crawl and in dire need of some food. Naturally we opted for a kebab and Al Arez was conveniently close by.We were seated quite quickly (group of 12 at midnight) and served shortly there after. We had all ordered some variety of shawarma and they came nicely rolled up. But cold. Oh so very cold. It seemed like they had taken them out of the fridge and not even bothered to zap them before serving. Needless to say, it was not worth the 3.75 squids I had to part with to get it. Overall, if I'm in edgware, I'd rather just grab a quick one at Helen's than try Al Arez but maybe the takeaway is better.",

    "text": "The food is amazing there, relatively cheap as well! Normally we'll go there and one main and one starter would be enough for two people, the bill rarely gets higher than \u00a323.The service is bad...sometimes you need to wait and wait and wait for food, but it's always worth the wait. I am also not a fan of the interior there ..lacks a 'dining out' atmosphere - i would say 3 stars for the atmosphere, and 5 stars for the food.Hummus, baba ganouj, tabouleh, lamb, chicken...everything is delicious, i like going there and trying something new every time. Mango juice is yummy and since I always loved complimentary stuff - in this case you get olives and pickled peppers and if you run out of bread but have loads of meat/sauce left, you can have more - for free! Sauces that comes with meals (i think one is garlicky and another is with chillies) - both are delicious. Al Arez is my frequent choice for Sunday dinners for sure, especially if i'm on the budget.",

I loved the super garlicky hummus; french beans in olive oil and lemon; okra and grilled halloumi. However, as a carnivore, it is with saliva quivering on my tongue that I say...Lamb.Oh, the lamb. \u00a0If you eat meat you *need* to buy their amazing shawarma sandwich. \u00a0The cheapest i've seen on this continent. \u00a33 buys you an obscenely fat wrap (width of a bloke's fist and bursting at the seams) packed with a gut-busting amount of the heavenly lamb, pickles, onion, sauces etc. \u00a0So so good. \u00a0Please, someone else go and review this sandwich so that I know it wasn't just a dream.",

    "text": "Over the years that i have been in London, i have frequently lusted at the delightful middle eastern eating joints that line both sides of the stretch of Edgware road between the Edgware Road tube station and Marble Arch, while travelling on the number 23 bus. But fate conspired to keep me away from there until last night when we dropped in to Al Arez after returning to London from a day out in the Midlands.I was greeted by the smell of the hookah smoke combined with that of lamb. It was enchanting. I looked around to find a huge plate of rice and minced lamb placed on the top of the counter. The decision was made ... i must have that. It was much like biriyani except for the fact that there weren't any big, solid pieces of meat. If you have it with yoghurt, it tastes just the same.My friends ordered hummus and chips for starters. The hummus was very nice, with just the right amount of olive oil and chickpeas at the centre. It was accompanied by a plate of olives and chillis with vinegar inside. I usually stay away from green chilis but this was a positive revelation to me.The chips were very english in nature ... and fresh. For the main course one of my friends ordered rice with an okra dish. I thought it was a decent dish, but my friend was of the opinion that it was quite bland. Another ordered kafta kashkash, a spicy kebab dish with lots of onions (both raw and fried) on the side ... very similar to seekh kebabs. \u00a0I had the lamb schwarma which was very good ... the meat was cooked to perfection. Two of us had the Ayran yoghurt drink which was very similar to the Indian \"chaas\", but with mint.The quantity of food served in each of the preparations were significantly above what we had expected. Their side-dish portions are more like that of a main course elsewhere. Unfortunately we couldn't possibly eat it all :(The only downside of the place was that the service was extremely slow, lousy and haphazard. It took inordinately long for the main courses to arrive. We had to move tables and they mixed up our orders after that and charged us for things we didn't have. The soft drinks were not cold and at least one of the servers was quite unhelpful (though another did a lot to make up for the first one). This place gets very crowded on saturday nights, but it seems that they don't have the systems to deal with the surge in customer numbers.But at only about \u00a316 per head for a full spread of food, its definitely a place i would return to if i am ever in that area.",

Service is awesome, great atmosphere. Not a lot of choice for drinks, but on the other hand, it kind of leads you to choose one of their fresh juices, which are juiced right there when you order. The portions are huge. This is important to note because if you want the proper experience (hummus, pita, tabouleh, etc) by the time you get your dinner you're already half full, and this is even worse if you order rice with it like I usually would want. In reality, the dish comes with everything you need. Half of a pita is all you need to go with the massive amount of meat you get, and our food came with it. I tried the kafta, and it was exactly what I wanted. Hummus, etc was also spot on...not sure why others would complain about water in it, since making tahini without water is impossible and its consistency does vary according to the type of restaurant/situation. A thinner tahini is not only common, but sometimes desirable.",

I do like sharing shisha in the outside seating area, even in the dead of winter. But, due to the high demand of tables and shisha lovers, the staff will tend to ignore you if you linger too long at your table. It was very rude as a customer to have to repeatedly ask for the hot coals to be replaced and to call attention for service. The last time I visited, I was there only for the food and sat indoors. After receiving the bill, I learned that I had been charged double for an item size that I didn't order. \u00a0And, some items had an extra 50p or \u00a31 added to the total cost per item. It was absolutely disgraceful and I doubt I will ever return again. This is a shame because Al Arez was my go-to-spot for shisha/Lebanese food on Edgware Road. The two stars is solely for the food which I previously enjoyed like the hummus, lamb doner, and milk pudding. The complimentary baklava is a sweet treat too, which is much needed after the distress you may face...",

I had hummus with mine and my partner had baba ganouj. I really have never had anything like this in the US, the flavors and textures were outstanding. The olive oil that was drizzled on my hummus was incredibly flavorful. Unfortunately, i \u00a0couldnt stop eating and had to walk a few extra miles just to breath.",

There is the area around the counter, very light, and not really a place where you want to rest too long. In the back, there is a more relaxed dining area that looked much more pleasant if you are not in a hurry.When I went there I ordered a delicious chicken dish. Tender and nicely spiced chicken pieces, a tasty dish and a place I will visit again.",

Granted this is also my first time in London but in comparison to any other Middle Eastern restaurants I've tried in the USA Al Arez is top of my list!Someone wrote to order food at the counter, good tip. On my visit someone actually sat us but then took forever for someone to take our order.My sister and I started with the hummus, very good. Maybe not the best ever but certainly any points lost here they were made up for with the Lamb Shawrama & Tabouleh! Again Lamb Shawrama & Tabouleh, fantastic! My sister had a sausage wrap (not the spicy one) which was also delicious!Not even close to the best service I've ever had but definitely tolerable for the oh soo delicious food :)",

I was shocked. I said it is very uncomfortable to sit 5 people in 2 small table. She said I will need the table anyways. The restaurant wasn't super busy. She seems like second floor manager. She was extremely rude. Then they totally messed up our drink. She also seemed very rude to her employees what I could see from far. I will never come back here again. Wouldn't recommend this place.

Service isn't friendly but it's fine for the most part. Food definitely took a while to come out.Food itself was mixed:-- Husband liked his chicken shish and the portion was substantial.-- Daughter didn't love the lamb shwarma and hardly ate it. I didn't try it but it was visually unappealing so maybe that was the problem? The accompanying rice was excellent though.-- I ordered the seabass, which came whole (my fault for not double checking it was a fillet). The fish was flavorless and had so many tiny bones that I couldn't eat most of it. Very disappointing.Overall I wasn't impressed and wouldn't return.

The portions were huuuuuuuge - we were all really full after the starters, so barely made a dent on the main courses.It's a no-alcohol restaurant, but there are loads of fresh juices and smoothies to have, plus the usual sodas and everything.Did I mention that this place is cheap? There were 5 of us and each of us had a starter, a main and a drink. The bill? Sixty of the Queen's finest pound notes. As Tim Wonnacott would say, that's a bargain.",

However the service was slowwwww! There was barely anybody in the restaurant and it was still so slow! We had to ask multiple times just to get our waters filled. The bad service totally ruined my ranking for this restaurant. Up the service guys!",
