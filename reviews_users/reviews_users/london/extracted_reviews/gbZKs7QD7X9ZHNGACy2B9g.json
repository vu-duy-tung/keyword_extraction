    "text": "i went to Brawn for lunch yesterday. im not sure what i was expecting, but this place took me by surprise.it was visually light and airy. the atmosphere was unpretentious and easy. our shy, sweet, very french, waitress felt like she had just stepped out of a little village and was just so willing to please, i could not help but smile encouragingly at her as she explained the dishes we didnt know (which were quite a few.). we got these dips as our starters. anything that lets me eat with my hands makes me happy. one was creamy and tasted slightly toasted and smokey, while the other was a bit more acid, but with the breakfast radishes, was a total yum.mains were a whole quail with pomegranate and pistachio (which my friend laughed at me for carving like a big bird, completely unconsciously), and foie gras (OMG) with puy lentils. we're talking a whole freaking lobe of foie. amazing. normally i feel the delicate flavour of Foie gets lost when served hot, it often just kind of melts and tastes of... well... fat, which technically it is, but theres so much more to it!!! this tastes amazing. especially eaten over sourdough bread \u00a0(from Hackney Wick. yay local). yum...and pudding. when i first got there my friend told me i didnt have a choice: we were getting the treacle tart. ok sure. whatever, i thought. ive had treacle tart a few times and have not been overly impressed. this was beautiful. soft and slightly chewy, but not sticking to your teeth. with a hint of ginger. pastry crust that actually tasted of its own flavor, not just a base for the flavor. yum..being that its around the corner from where i live i will go again. for sure.",

    "text": "hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026  I have to start with some food-independent whining. I have spent the last 2 weeks studying (ergo reduced posting frequency) and should still be studying for my viva on Monday but if someone mentions the word immunology to me ever again or asks me anything about gamma-delta T cells or psoriasis, I might have to kill him/her. (This in fact doesn't bode well for my examiners.) So please keep your fingers crossed for me on Monday! So I decided now to focus on something more interesting (although I don't know if anything could possibly be more interesting than skin gamma-delta T cells..) and this is my recent meal at Brawn with the lovely Uyen from Fernandez & Leluu. Brawn, which for the non-English among us means Presskopf (G) or head cheese (AE) or (other languages), a dish I am in fact not desperately keen on, is the sister restaurant of Terroirs in Covent Garden. It has opened a couple of months ago in Columbia Road in East London, where you can find the most amazing flower market on Sundays, so this is worth checking out independently of Brawn anyway. Like Terroirs and also some other recently opened places such as Polpo, Brawn's concept is the sharing of small plates. I desperately wanted to like Brawn \u00a0I liked the location, the decor, the atmosphere, the wine list, the waiters and the fact that they gave us a free dessert after we found a shell in our pork rillette. But in the end what really counts is the food and I just really wasn't blown away by any of the dishes served. Once in a while I feel like Pork Rillette (6) \u00a0salted pork meat slowly cooked in pork fat. The version at Brawn was certainly generous, even a bit too generous actually. If we had finished this heavily cholesterol-rich dish between the two of us, I don't think we would have had space left for any more food. It was pleasant but undistinguished. If you want to save money however, that's the way to go \u00a0you can have a perfectly filling, artery-clotting meal for 3 pounds/pp. (I know I should shut up about health considerations when talking about restaurants, but once in while I just can't hold myself back, forgive..) My favourite dish was the Dorset Palourde clams & Manzanilla (8). The clams were nicely cooked but the real winner was the sauce \u00a0a heaven of olive oil, garlic and sherry. I ate most of it dipped with bread. The Hand-chopped Tuscan style beef (8) was certainly of high quality and served with lovely warm, toasted bread. It however lacked any kind of seasoning, and was therefore utterly dull. I think this would have been very successful with some salt and pepper, some herbs and maybe a tiny bit of chili The 1/2 pint of Atlantic Prawns with mayonnaise (8) came exactly as advertised. Again high quality ingredients but nothing was done to elevate the dish above the plain mediocre. We pointed out to the waiter that there was a shell in midst of our pork rillette. The manager immediately came to our table, apologised and gave us the pork rillette and a dessert for free. I mean this is truly fantastic customer service and hardly ever encountered in the London restaurant scene. I should also mention that we ordered the wrong bottle of wine by mistake and could change it without even having to pay for the sip we had already drunk. Thank you Brawn, you were nice to us (slightly difficult customers). So then the dessert with the very promising name crepes with salted caramel butter (5) arrived at our table. I took the first bite and found the combination of salt and caramel really lovely and unusual. But then the bitter aftertaste of burnt sugar kicked in, overpowered everything else and spoiled everything for me. I don't know now if this dish was supposed to taste like this and I just did not get it or if the caramel had been burnt by mistake. Overall, I think Brawn is not a bad place and much less pretentious than Terroirs. However, I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there. Sorry.",

    "text": "Menu on swedishmeatballeatslondo\u2026  Brawn opened fairly recently (at least I think so, I haven't seen it before and I am quite frequently at the flower market at Columbia Road) but was full of people and cute waiters. The place feels small (although I \"discovered\" another dining room when I got up to walk around) and is nice and cosy. I felt too embarrassed to whip out the camera, so all I have is a picture of the menu. So many things I'd love to eat on there! What we ended up eating: first, Maldon oysters and Dorset Palourde Clams & Manzanilla. I am still a wimp and haven't yet gotten over my fear of oysters, instead gobbling up the clams which were out of this world. Next up, the dish that got me most excited: hand chopped Tuscan style beef. This was raw, prime quality beef chopped up with very little else and served with wild sourdough bread, and it blew my mind. I think I will develop an addiction to this beef. On recommendation from our lovely waiter we ordered the buffalo mozzarella with olive oil. Lovely! We also had the baked mushrooms with bone marrow, which were crispy and just very, very nice. Brawn has some very nice wines on their wine list but I'm trying to be real nice to my body for a change and stop abusing it with too much wine. Next time! For dessert we shared \"floating islands\" - I had no idea what this was but out came a fluffy cloud of meringue floating in creme anglaise topped with crunchy burnt caramel crumbs. Does that not sound amazing? It was. And so was the entire dinner - I absolutely loved Brawn. Every single dish was simple and clean and clearly made with great ingredients - the beef and clams were perfect examples of this. The service was lovely and the bathroom had mandarin skin soap and moisturiser... but even without it would have been outstanding. A perfect night!",

Looked up a nice place near Schoreditch on Thrillist and I liked immediately the atmosphere from the pictures. Needless to say that when inside it was much better, very warm and welcoming.They give us a table for 2 even though we didn't book, but I have to say the place was not full.The starters were some salami and scotch eggs (delicious!!) and pumpkin. we had a lovely cod fillet with potatoes for mail and probably the best pannacotta I've ever had for dessert. And I'm Italian.The menu with starter, main course and dessert comes for \u00a328 with drinks on top.Not the cheapest, but the place look cozy and the food is amazing.Will go back soon.",

    "text": "The only thing I don't like about Brawn is not always being able to get a table....but even that is ok, since it has allowed me to dine at the bar many times. And here you get to really experience how attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly the staff is. I just love this place, and if I lived in the neighborhood, I'd be there many nights a week for a glass or two of wine.The food: as many have mentioned, they tend to include a lot of the less glamorous parts of the beast......but hey, it's named \"brawn,\" so no surprises there. There are plenty of things for the less adventurous though, and, more importantly, they do a great job with fresh, seasonal ingredients put together in flavorful ways. I still dream of a roasted Jerusalem artichoke dish they had, not to mention the different variations of scallops and mussels I've had. But I really do love the meat, from nose to tail: brawn and rillettes, always great as starters. The blood sausage over frisee had the right amount of acid to cut through the richness of the sausage.And because I trust them so much on the food, when I saw a calves brain starter I thought: well, if I'm ever gonna try this, and if there's a chance of me ever liking this, then it's here. And it was, in fact, delicious (definitely too rich as a small dish for 1...perfect to be split). So that's my new rule there: try anything and everything, they won't let you down.The wine: these are serious wine people. I'm only a lazy and vaguely aspiring serious wine person, and not really. And this is the perfect place for me because they are so enthusiastic, knowledgeable and opinionated about the wine and food, they're willing to push you in surprising directions. Again, I've never been let down, and I've almost always been utterly delighted.The space: as mentioned, it's not always easy to get a table. But I really like sitting at the bar and would recommend it to anyone solo or even a pair. Getting a table is nice though: they're well-spaced, so you don't feel like you're a part of your neighbor's private conversation (and visa versa). They have a larger back room, both sides are nice. It's not flashy, it doesn't solicit a self-anointed beautiful crowd to loiter in the bar area -- if that's your seen, there are better places to be seen.One of my very favorite restaurants, in any city.",

    "text": "If you consider Brawn by its definition as \"solid and well-developed muscles, especially of the arms and legs\" you might be disappointed. At this Brawn, the French rustic-chic restaurant on Columbia Road, you might be surprised by the menu. Consisting of mostly uncommon animal parts - such as brain, organs and more obscure appendages - it serves up some not so desirable dishes in the most accessible way. Myself, being mostly vegetarian dabbling in red meat a few bites a month, I didn't think this place was my style. I must say, I got a few months-worth of meat quotas in the other night.I recommend whatever you wish to order as the options are all off kilter and it's a menu that changes daily but the seafood sausage bisque was one of the tastiest dishes I've had in a while, and it was a last minute, 'sure, we'll try that too'.",

    "text": "This spot is a favorite of the friends with whom I was staying a few weeks ago, and became a favorite of mine. We went in for Sunday lunch and had a splendid meal. The courses were ample, with a delicious first course of whole roasted fishes, charcuterie, a wonderful mozzarella and ratatouille dish, yummy scotch eggs, and some of the finest, heartiest bread I may have ever had. For mains, our table tried all three options, including a delicious fish option, a big, super rich pork belly option, and a cheese souffle. I was appreciative of the way the staff found connections between the entrees (gigante beans, a savory tomato sauce) so that sampling was a fluid and enjoyable process, even if their intention was largely for cost and efficiency reasons. And for dessert, we were all given enormous squares of tiramisu, to which I fear none of us did complete justice, though it was some of the best, light and properly airy tiramisu I have had lately. We were simply too stuffed from the prior two courses, and since we're a crowd who loves a meal, that was pretty impressive: a true statement of just how good those first two courses were. We also (as you do) had \u00a0lovely carafes of wine and a great many coffees, and were entirely pleased with our selection. Best of all, the pricing wasn't at all as expected. For the meal, it was entirely reasonable, and for the hip atmosphere, it was more than affordable.As for the atmosphere, it's charming, open, and thus quite loud in the front, and I prefer the front room to the more shut-in rear portion of the restaurant. On Sundays, there seem to be a great many flowers and plants making their way into the place due to the market, which gave it a slightly helter-skelter atmosphere that was actually really lovely. Our server, though new, was very attentive and made sure we were kept sated. All in all, it was one of our favorite meals and experiences of our trip, and if we lived in the area, I imagine we would become regulars, just as our friends have done.",

    "text": "I went with some friends to this amazing wine bar and restaurant on Columbia Road (E2). A nice, open space, feels like a converted carriage house or garage. There are two rooms, a bar room up front, and a dining room in the back. We sat in the back, where the dining area shares the space with the open kitchen. This is definitely a Slow Food sort of place (actually, I heard about it from a Slow Food email). Lots of local products and purveyors.We ordered a bunch of different items, and just told them to bring things as they were ready (as opposed to having the meal in distinct courses). First to arrive was the heirloom tomato plate. Very simple, but fantastic. Essentially slices of beautiful, ripe tomatoes with some olive oil and maybe a hint of fresh herbs. We also tried the Gem Salad, which was an entire lettuce cut into quarters with a garlicky dressing drizzled on top of it. Clear signs that the chef shares my belief in the essential two-step method for gourmet cooking: Step 1: Start with really good ingredients. Step 2: Don't f**k them up.Next up was an artichoke terrine with carrots, some other veggies, and a vinegary dressing. Again, that perfect balance of letting the ingredients speak for themselves, and just gently combining them.All of this was accompanied by fantastic sourdough bread from one of the bakeries over near London Fields. One more sign that London has a decent claim to being one of the top cities for bread in the world.We also tried one of the French ciders which was delightfully crisp with just the right hint of carbonation. Can't remember the exact labelling, but it was the cheapest of the three that they offer. On a future visit I shall have to try the pricier ones to find out what we were missing.Next up was a plate of dorset clams with green onions, some garlic, and a hint of fresh red chili. The freshness of the clams, and the subtlety of the very fresh vegetables gave this dish a fantastic mouthfeel with just a hint of fire.The final savoury dish was my personal favourite. An English Pea and Girolle Risotto. First off, the waitress assured me that the risotto was vegetarian, which is always pleasing. So annoying when someone offers what sounds like it should be a vegetarian dish but then use chicken stock to make it. For starters the dish was an amazing green colour (see photo). And then the taste. Pure summer on a plate. The flavour of a perfectly ripe pea concentrated and carried in the richness of the rich, and then slightly offset by the earthiness of the girolle. Brilliant.For pudding we had a roasted peach with pistachio, and a chocolate ganache with hazelnut cream served with a meringue and some chantilly cream. We accompanied these with a glass of Muscat and a Cherry liqueur.The major thing which we really failed to explore was the wine list which was extensive and looked very well thought through. Perhaps next time.....The only reason this gets four stars instead of five is that I am concerned that the menu may become less vegetarian friendly as the weather changes. They are definitely meat-centric, but I hope that they will continue their innovative veggies as well.",

    "text": "From the team behind the ever popular Covent Garden wine bar Terroirs; comes the \"cooler\" younger sister Brawn, located on East London's Columbia Road. Since its opening in late 2010, Brawn has had nothing but positive reviews, and so of course it had to be ticked off Gourmet Belly's Eat List. On any other day, the menu comprises of rustic French small plates divided into sections - 'taste ticklers', 'slow cook', 'raw' and a dedicated 'pig' section, a tribute to the restaurants name. On Sunday's however, their offering is a 3 course set menu for \u00a325. With no choice of what you get, this had better be good. A nice little spread of starters arrived. Breakfast radishes and fennel with an Anchoiade dip, the novelty of a globe artichoke with a hollandaise vinaigrette, and a selection of charcuterie consisting of the some salami, brawn terrine and the most deliciously well portioned pork rillette you could ever imagine! Next up was the Roast Landaise Chicken. Presented bottoms up with watercress coming out of its backside, it was an impressive example of how a roast chicken should be done - tender and juicy with the skin slightly crispy; and the buttery jersey royals and spring veg which accompanied this perfect chook, were ever so moreish too. And just as we were about to undo another notch to our belts, two large bowls of mess of the Eton kind were placed on our table along with a cheese board (\u00a35 supplement). Overall, the whole dining experience was hugely enjoyable. The restaurant had a great buzz about it. The staff were efficient and particularly knowledgeable on their extensive wine list, but most importantly, the food. Every dish was packed full of flavour, yet simply cooked, allowing the quality of the produce to shine through. I'll definitely be back to feed the belly with more from that pig and graze through their full menu. Oink! For full review and pictures, please go to gourmetbelly.wordpress.c\u2026  x",

    "text": "Probably more like 4.5 star but that aside. (I'm normally very selective with my 5 stars but can't really see downgrading given the friendly and helpful service and the warm and unpretentious atmosphere.) My main course was an oxtail pie with glazed carrots on the side. Sort of a cross between English and French-style pies and the rich flavor demonstrates why all these flavorful but less inherently tender cuts are hot these days. I had the charcuteries sampler and my only complaint (my fault) was that it was really too much food for a single person's appetizer. The brawn pate (basically a very rough country pate) was the standout although the pork rillettes and the salami were excellent as well. \u00a0It's a bit off the beaten track in gentrifying Shoreditch but it's one of the excellent newish restaurants in the area.",

    "text": "I only very recently visited Terroirs for the first time so having heard that the owners have just opened a brand new restaurant on Columbia Road called Brawn, we decided to take my mum and check it out when she came to visit the weekend before Christmas. It was the coldest day of the year and we trudged across London through the snow to get there. Market stalls outside were selling Christmas trees like crazy, which added to the Christmassy atmosphere! Brawn doesn't have a sign outside \u00a0luckily we had taken note of the building number before we left. The decor is different to Terroirs \u00a0Brawn is very East London with cool, vintage/reclaimed furniture and the inside is white, much brighter than Terroirs. The tables are white with old reclaimed wooden chairs, good quality cutlery and very thin glass beakers, which I LOVE. I scanned down the menu and immediately decided to order the Pork Rillete \u00a0after having the Duck version at Terroirs a couple of weeks ago, I knew I was in for a treat. I have to say that I didn't know what the majority of the menu was due to the fact that a lot of it is written in French (maybe I should have paid more attention at school). So we asked one of the many attractive French waiters that was on hand to explain. The fresh Bread basket that is brought to the table at the beginning of the meal is most certainly my downfall, especially since it was delicious freshly baked Sourdough Bread from local e5 Bakehouse. Along came the Pork Rilette and we all tucked in. I didn't think that my Boyfriend and Mum would like it due to the high fat content but they wolfed it down. The best way to eat this dish is by buttering a slice of Bread, slathering the Pork Rilette on top and adding a slice of Cornichon (that's Gherkin to me and you). Next came the Brandade with Green Beans and Warm Duck Egg Yolk. Brandade is an emulsion of salt cod and olive oil \u00a0the addition of Duck Egg Yolk was fantastic, rich and runny. Again, a dish that needed to be eaten with the fresh Bread. We also ordered the Mongetes \u00a0another dish that I had to check before hand. It is a Catalan dish of Sausage with White Beans and it arrived at the table hot and sizzling. The Sausage proved too much for one of the party so it was left to two of us. It was quite a filling dish and we had trouble finishing it all. It would definitely be good to recreate this dish on a cold winters day. We also shared the Puy Lentil and Ham Hock Soup. The Lentils had been purified so the soup had an extremely creamy texture. It was delicious \u00a0the only slight problem was that there were only two bits of Ham in the dish and that wasn't enough since we were sharing! We were only out for lunch so we didn't have a pudding but instead moved on to another cafe just off Brick Lane. I think that Brawn is a fantastic place for lunch but I'd like to go back for dinner and sample the wine list and experience the atmosphere of the restaurant when it is busier.",

Duck hearts were perfectly cooked but the polenta was slightly underseasoned. Carne salata was colourful and beautifully presented. Salt cod contrasted nicely with the potatoes. If the mains, the best was the squid and black pudding. Delicious!! \u00a0I ordered the oxtail which unfortunately was served off the bone. I liked it but didn't love it. The house red wine was better than the bottle we ordered so I would definitely recommend just getting that. Overall, a very good meal at Brawn.",

The place itself is very nice, busy but not crowded. The menu changes every night (with some basics often coming back). We picked 2 different starters to share: something with crab and a classic mozzarella. Both very good! Then, I followed my friend's advice and ordered the squid with black pudding. Even though I found the combo a bit strange he guaranteed me it would taste great. And it indeed did! He picked the lamb that was very good too. We also had a nice bottle of wine recommended by a friendly staff. I spent a very pleasant night. I found the prices a bit high butOK I guess for cool place in London..",

    "text": "Dinner at Brawn + post-dinner wine at Sagers & Wild = perfect date. There you have it -- in case you don't read any further, I've progressed your romantic life just a bit. Brawn has quickly perched itself atop my \"low key, but excellent dining spots in London\" list. Based on two visits, I must finally divulge my thoughts on this Columbia Road pearl. First, make a reservation or take your chances. It was comfortably full on a Saturday evening, and our group of 4 could only secure a 6pm dinner slot. It's very easy via TopTable, so do yourself a favor and skip the stress, just make one. It's a difficult balance to strike: excellent, thoughtful, locally-sourced food in an unpretentious atmosphere with genuine service. In fact, it's scarce. Brawn pulls it off beautifully. On my most recent visit -- I enjoyed a glass of prosecco, the prosciutto (a must off the piggy portion of the menu), Icelandic cod, rabbit ravioli, a delicious onglet, the cheese souffle (a mainstay on the menu it seems, don't miss it!) and a fresh green salad. Not a miss in the bunch. Plates are meant for sharing and come out as soon as they are ready...and on this particular night, they were flying out of the kitchen, much to our delight. Oh, and the dessert. A tangy, light cheesecake with passionfruit, sea salt chocolate mousse and a berry crumble. Our table was delighted. The desserts aren't fancy, but they pack a serious sweet punch. *upon request they refilled our sourdough breadbasket and butter gleefully. It's almost like when attending a party and the servers keep filling your wine glass without you noticing, and then -- you realize you unintentionally drank too much. The sourdough bread (made right in Hackney) is so delicious, I suggest you get \"bread drunk\" as I did. Beers on offer of interest: Kernel. My husband loves this, so perhaps worth noting. I stick the chalkboard wine list...rotating often. They are known to have an excellent selection of beer and wine to accompany the food. One of my favorites. Pro-date-tip: Follow it up with a visit to Sagers & Wild (just down the way on Ravenscroft Street). Review to follow, of course...",

    "text": "Fantastic food with friendly service. It was our last night in London, so we splurged. Their sourdough bread is magical: chewy on the inside, crunchy on the outside, with just the right hint of a tang. I hadn't yet been to a place in England that gave complimentary bread, so I was really excited. The butter that's served is soft (as it should be!) and it was all I could do to stop myself from completely filling myself up before my actual food came.Good thing I didn't-- my appetizer, the burrata with roasted broccolini, had a great balance of smooth and smoky. My friend's appetizer was even better! The clam dish let the clams sing, accenting them with some garlic and scallions (and there was no grit at all!). We ended up ordering another to share, since it was that good. We also shared the scotch egg, which was surprisingly spicy. I've never had one before, so I don't know if this is how they usually are. It was a tiny quail egg, so not the usual version, but I really liked it. We ordered the charcuterie plate and my friends LOVED the terrine that came with it. My main dish was hake, mussels and fingerling potatoes in a creamy but light sauce (it had green bits in it but I forgot what they were). The fish was perfectly cooked. We also tried the other fish, the plaice meuniere (served on the bone), which came with mashed potatoes. Pretty good, but not as delicious as my hake. My other friend ordered the souffle, which came with a side salad, and she really enjoyed it as well.We had a leisurely two or so hour dinner-- the place was virtually empty when we arrived at 7 but very busy when we left after 9. Our waitress and the other staff were very friendly and came over consistently but not annoyingly. Appetizers came out very quickly, as did the complimentary bread (which they refilled); it took a little longer for our entrees, but since we liked the environment, it was nice to just sit and chat.It's got kind of a hipster vibe, with wooden tables and candlelight, and it's in a little bit of a sketchy neighborhood (at least the parts we walked through from the London Overground). But it's definitely worth checking out!",

Food and are are a bit of a French/Italian mix. \u00a0Service is prompt and piteous but not over the top. Perfect for a date night or good meal out with friends.",

    "text": "We came here for lunch on a rainy February day. The restaurant looks slightly non-descript from the street and inside the minimalist theme continues with clean white walls and compact tables. However with some good tunes playing in the background, buzzy atmosphere and friendly staff, Brawn is immediately relaxing. The menu is presented tapas style with our waitress recommending 2-3 per person. This allowed us a fair chance to explore the menu, ordering the charcuterie plate, chard/anchovies, tapenade, salt beef hash and duck egg and a crab raviolo. All were excellent with the terrine on the charcuterie plate really standing out \u00a0with pronounced piggy flavours and a good dense texture although everything was very good. We finished with the salted caramel crepes which were absolutely delicious. A further reason to visit it the wine list which is both good value and interesting with a biodynamic/organic focus. We only ordered from the 'by the glass' part of the list but found plenty to enjoy. The remainder of the list provides a good reason to return!",

    "text": "You know how it's really cringey when you watch the Family Stone and the guy that was dating SJP ends up with Clare Danes? Why is it that if you like one person and they have a sibling, your sexual attraction seems to carry over? Well, despite my best efforts to never have this happen to me in real life, Brawn, I've also been in love with your sister, though I'll let you decide who is the SJP of this situation (I've always been more of a Clare Danes fan, but really just from MSCL but she's also the reason it only lasted one season so I kind of blame her for that as well... ... ... I'm getting off track).Since this is my neighborhood branch of this lovely little arrangement, I finally made a stop in with some friends for dinner. It was a bit slow at first and I thought maybe my making a reservation was over-ambitious but within the hour, the entire place filled up! We went with some onglet steaks and cheese souffle, delightful. A wine reccomendation from the server, delightful... and you know how I feel about places with sparkling water on tap. DELIGHTFUL. these are the things that make you excited in your 30s. Great cosy place for dinner, could easily be a bit on the romantic side or a table of 4 catching up over a bottle of wine...just watch out for the one friend that brings the conversation back to her man troubles, she'll be the SJP of your life.",

    "text": "Went to Brawn this weekend with visitors and can't wait to go back! More on our meal below, but first: I'm friends with lots of vege- and pescatarians, and people who aren't adventurous eaters and blah blah blah. Somehow, oddly, I'd bring them all to Brawn. We would skip the charcuterie course obviously, but I have no doubt that they would be more than pleased with the MANY non-daring, non-pork, non-meat items on this not-so-huge menu. Currently, there are three vegetarian and two pescatarian starters (of seven), as well as two vegetarian entrees and two pescatarian starters (also of seven). So though the place is named Brawn, and the logo is a... strange amalgam of a pig and a bottle of wine, check out their menu online before you go if you are doubting whether they have something for you. Just saying! ANYWAY: We started with Nduja Scotch eggs, a charcuterie platter with salami, brawn, and what was basically a huge scoop of the pork equivalent of chopped liver--I honestly don't know what it was called, but it was delicious. Brawn (the dish) itself is not my thing, but my fellow diners loved it.For starters, we had the Isle of Man Queenies (which melted in my mouth and were generally exquisite), the tomato salad (beautiful toms with great flavor) and the mozzarella salad (good but nothing special was the diner's report).Entrees were saffron risotto with seafood (two of us ordered it, couldn't resist) and Atlantic cod, which we paired all of this with two summery bottles of Lambrusco and were just pleased as punch. Portion sizes were perfect (not precious, not overwhelming) and all of the flavors were spot-on. My risotto would have been paella if it were less creamy and if the rice had been caramelized on the bottom of the skillet, so calling it a risotto was a smart move. It was delicious.Desserts were a cherry trifle and a white peach pavlova, both heavenly and delicately flavored (I don't like cherry desserts, but I liked this one). Friendly service, lovely atmosphere, great experience.",
