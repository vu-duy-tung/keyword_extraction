Stuff you might not see often in London but stuff that any Belgian beer fan would have tried at least three times before. Seating area inside was crowded and the bar staff seemed to be struggling a bit. Definitely did not know anything about the beers. Prices were a bit high but I suppose on par with this area of London. Not a terrible place to visit, especially if you are dying to get Belgian beer. I just don't think I'll be returning anytime soon.",

I went for a Christmas lunch a while ago and since then have popped in for one or two. I actually even enjoyed a half of fruity beer, although it did make me want to vomit after. Not a good sign when you've only had one! I just don't have the stomach for hops.I'm knocking this place slightly because if you are eating here the service is pretty terrible. It's slow and unorganised but luckily it's redeeming factor is that it's friendly. I don't mind so much waiting over an hour for food when someone actually admits they made a mistake and apologises with a genuine smile. I'll go back, for sure. Just maybe I'll stick with a wine.",

    "text": "When it comes to restaurants, it really is true that a venue lives and dies by its service. This Belgian gastro-bar is proof of that. On paper, all the ingredients should automatically add up to a great dining experience. Delicious-sounding Belgian treats such as Indonesian-style mussels and venison burger dot the menu. This is complemented by a massive and interesting beer list featuring both the strong and fruity varieties of lowland amber nectar. Problem is, it's a popular place, and in my three visits there I have never left without feeling at least somewhat disappointed by the service on offer. Yesterday was a case in point. Myself and my parents dropped in as my dad had a hankering for seafood and I had told him about the Moules Marineres. We entered, were greeted by nobody and so chose our table ourselves. When a waitress arrived, she took our drinks order straight away, but didn't return to give us food menus. I found them on another table. After we'd ordered, it took fully forty minutes and two summonings of the waitreess before our food arrived, by which time we were nearly crawling up the walls with hunger. I noticed another table having trouble with their order too. The food was fine, edible, but not nearly as exciting as the daring ingredient choice suggests. Give me a decent cheeseburger and a Stella served by a competent waitress over a run-of-the-mill venison burger with peach beer served by someone who is slow, incompetent and unwilling to acknowledge or apologise for mistakes made.",

They also had an unusually excellent house wheat beer, which I happily guzzled a couple of pints of alongside other favourites of mine such as Tripel Karmeleit. I liked the option to try 3 x 1/3 pints of different beer, although I didn't take advantage of it. True to Belgian beer, it was pricey, but that just comes with the territory.The food was much better than other reviews would have you believe too. I went for a not-so-Belgian (unless you count it as stoempe) Cumberland sausages, gravy and mash, which was perfectly decent. I then followed it with a waffle and scoop of ice cream which was okay but probably out of a packet.Also worth mentioning is the high-ceilinged interior, reminiscent of the similarly styled bars in Brussels. The service could have been slightly better, but I can still happily declare myself a fan of this place.",

Hubby got the chicken Cesar Salado got the smoked mackerel salad, both salads were tasty, but portions were shockingly small in comparison to the US. We also got the double dutch fried fries which were excellent, just delicious. Garlic bread was OK, not great.

What is indisputable, however, is their desserts! SO...GOOD... Donuts, waffles, marshmallows, all to dip into caramel or chocolate sauces on skewers, served to share. Yeah... now I've gone and made myself hungry. Service is a bit scattered, the place is absolutely packed most of the time - especially after work but hanging out outside the bar is accepted.

    "text": "Despite being literally just off the junction of Great Queen Street and Drury Lane, a few hundred yards away from Covent Garden Market as well as the Seven Dials, Lowlander Grand Cafe is surprisingly never that busy. \u00a0Like the Belgo restaurants in its angle (big lists of Belgian beers and delicious-sounding menu options), Lowlander pulls off comfortably cool with greater finesse. \u00a0The seating area is small yet has a great sense of space. \u00a0The decor is wooden and homey (rather than metal and industrial). \u00a0And the beer menu is actually longer than those at the Belgo establishments around the corner. \u00a0The service has always been on the average-to-good side on my visits.The servers are just as content for you to come and have a couple drinks as they are for you to order food, so there's no need to feel bad about monopolizing a table if you're not eating. \u00a0Especially since you'll probably end up spending \u00a320 alone on drinks. \u00a0Coming in thinking you'll just have a glass or two, one 8% ABV drink leads to another (and to another) and you've lost your capacity for rational thought.Although the forest-berry wheat beer on draught that I had yesterday was only \u00a32.95 per half-pint and damn tasty to boot. \u00a0Recession-busting win!The drinks menus boast of several different themed beer-tasting parties available upon booking. \u00a0I imagine this would be a fun night out for a special occasion, although the one party that required a sommelier had a hefty \u00a3160 sommelier fee. \u00a0Oi.",

    "text": "Totally disagree with Derry here. When I knew I was headed to London for the first time - (to hang out with my little sister who was studying abroad) I decided to look up any Belgian bars in the area (something I've been known to do when I travel) and found - The Lowlander. The Lowlander was wonderful. \u00a0It was close to the Underground and near my sister's dorm - I used my Google map to find it and it was super easy to get there (not something you can say about everywhere in London) It was a bit crowded on the Thursday night were were there, but not awful - we were the only ones waiting for a table at about 7:30pm or so, we got a couple of beers at the bar and quickly found some seats after a couple left. It's a little tight packed in there, but once we got a table we stayed for a good 2 hours enjoying some truly delicious pub food and um...amazing beers. I loved the atmosphere - it was large and open without feeling overwhelming but had a few nooks and crannies for drinking. And the beer selection was truly worthy. I also thought the the service was respectable and lightly friendly without being \"uncool\" - and it wasn't far from where my sister was staying near Tottenham Court \u00a0- so the streets in the area were busy with a lot of foot traffic - but Drury lane was enough away from the main area to give it a \"tucked away\" feelingAfter seeing a couple of tables with one, we went for the \"paddle.\" 9 beers from the tap - a sampler - this was truly the way to go. The glasses were not wimpy or small like the ones they have in America - they were pretty hearty - and we finished them off together.I also tried a beer I've yet to see in the States - it was one of the best beers I've ever had and the name is completely fitting - Hoegaarden's Forbidden Fruit. We had such an amazing time there - we tried to go back before our trip was over but it was a Saturday night and the bar was way too packed (it was summer and hello, awesome bar, I can see why) - however, though we didn't get to partake again, my sister was grateful for the find and friends and her frequented it a lot before returning home. Definitely a must if you want to get some real, and hard to find beer while in London.",

    "text": "preamble -We piled in here after a UYE at Belgo Centraal. I was still bemused by the childlike servers dressed as trappist monks who had waited on us there and as I was late (due to another mystery tour of the London underground) I missed getting my face into the Moulles so the Hoeegarden i necked double time had started its wicked magic on my empty tum.The main event -I like the Lowlander, it was not too crowded for Covent Garden and the service to our table was responsive, friendly and rapid and they know their Belgian/Dutch brews alright. The choice here is staggering and it would require too many visits to work thru the stock so it may help if you have a clear idea of what you like otherwise you can use their Blackboard for the latest and greatest. The decor is very Grote Markts and typical of most lowland town bars so you certainly get that 'Flemish' vibe.Caveat emptor-There should be a warning posted at the Lowlander as those classic tramp juices, Special Brew & Steam beer, are out muscled by some of the monstrously strong ales sold here. You are at risk of getting seriously wankered if you do not check the ABV ratings. As usual I steamed in and went for the Stout sampler made up of three drinks, Kwak, Hercule & Scaldis with a combined ABV of 28%. This was sufficient to bring down a charging Rhino and went straight to my boots. From a taste point of view the Scaldis was right up there so, foolishly, I ordered another pint and shared it with Jo. Lucky for me, not so lucky for Jo !! The stagger back to the Embankment tube station was a blur of faces and lights and when I switched at Vauxhall i jumped on the first train heading West with the intent of getting off at Staines. FAIL. Woke up at 1am 'ish in Guildford station where I stumbled off the train and into Dick Turpin who was driving a black cab called Bess .....",

Service was quicker than expected.The food and drink menu was extensive. With fare from Belgium, mussels and fries were a must for me. I went with the miso and ginger broth, super flavorful and a little spicy. Loads of mushrooms tucked in with the mussels. They were smaller than you will find in Brussels but delicious. Bread and fries to boot!The beer selection has all the European staples and something for everyone, even wine lovers like half of our group. I had a tasty brown ale, very rich and deep.Overall it was a good evening, save for the bathrooms under construction where I saw a dead cockroach in the toilet. Skip the loo if you can!",

My friends and I got the Grande Cafe Platter and the Moules Marinieres (translation: delicious muscles) - both great choices. I only give it 4 stars because they need air fresheners in the stairway to the bathrooms (quite unappetising) and the games they provide are missing pieces! If you're going to provide games and bathrooms please make them enjoyable.",

    "text": "We booked a reservation for 15 on a Thursday and they gave us the entire upstairs area for the whole night! The employees are super nice, and when we came in with 20 people, they happily accommodated us. I was concerned about the bill since figuring out how to split between 20 people would be difficult, and they happily solved that by giving us bar service. Everyone ordered at the bar downstairs but the food was brought upstairs.I got the half chicken and it was a little dry, but the presentation was lovely and the taste was good too. If I go back next time, I'd definitely want to try the mussels.The BEER! I fell in love with fruit beer when I went to Belgium and they have a good assortment of Belgian fruit beer here. I'd go back just for a beer with friends. They also had a pre-theatre menu set but I didn't get it. Would try next time!",

As a fan of Belgian beer this was the perfect spot to come to. We had mussels and pulled pork. The pulled pork was flavorful and had a wonderful side of coleslaw. Only issues was if it's busy do not expect a very attentive waitress (fair enough and understandable) and incredibly loud. Lots and lots of yelling. Nice interior though and as mentioned before great beer options.",

Drinking beer is in his blood, and he actually bartended here before getting settled with his full-time job. His love of this place influenced me. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and you can either sit and relax, or stand by the bar and be loud. I personally like the sit on the comfy chairs opposite the bar and get food... they have great mussels with butter sauce and a filling meat platter, which is great to share with friends. I always order the fruit beer but they are known to have a diverse selection of Belgian beer.Sometimes it gets packed and rowdy but it's a cozy place to go in a group since the setting is very welcoming and the beer choices are limitless. The staff are also very nice... overall I always had a good time here.",
