I had a few cold salads like a sesame chickpea dish, a lemon couscous, roasted veg pasta and onion rings! Everything was labeled too. We even had a few vegan desserts (aka puddings) to choose from! Using coconut milk, they made panacotta and two different fruit mousses. And also a sticky toffee pudding with dates. \u00a0I didn't realize they were a veggie award winner until we got there! I would eat here more than once, although it was a bit expensive.",

I wasn't quite sure what to expect of this place, but I was pleasantly surprised when I first walked in. A large bar was to the right and the buffet to the left. The place had a stylish club/lounge feel to it - a little on the sexy side, inviting and the kind of establishment you'd want to linger around after dinner. Is this really a vegetarian place? \u00a0;-)Being my first time there, the host said to grab a plate, fill it up with food, take it to the bar area to have it weighed, order drinks if desired and pay for everything. Easy as that!The hot food was on top and salad/cold food on the bottom. There was a good representation of dishes available - Asian, Italian, Middle Eastern and Indian. You'll need to be careful, as it can add up quickly wanting to cram your plate with everything. I was able to escape with a plate of food and a drink for just a hair under \u00a310.Overall the food was good, and if money wasn't an object, I would have gone back for seconds and thirds!Gluten free options were available, including bread.Dessert was also on the buffet, with fresh fruit, cheesecake and blueberry muesli.",

I must say, as far as buffets go, this is really tasty and very well priced. Considering the immediate buffet alternative that comes to mind - Whole Foods- I found this vastly superior. You have to take it for what it is: a great option to chain-lunches. I thought their hot food was especially pleasant. I would definitely go again. OH! Did I mention they have an outdoor patio where you can dine alfresco and oogle all the suited and booted cuties of the area? SCORE.",

You can choose from so many good things and in the end you pay by weight. I always go for a little bit of everything on the mains and I am always getting really excited if I see there is Cheesecake and Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert! They are both absolutely fantastic!!! For a drink the passion fruit lemonade is my recommendation, it's heavenly refreshing!The restaurant is such a good place to hang out and relax but they also do take away.Seriously if I had enough money and if I'd work or live nearby, I'd come here every single day!",

My traveling partner had eaten there the day before and wanted to come back.Every item was labeled veggie, vegan, gluten free, etc.We got a bottle of organic wine ( which is normally not very good but this was great) along with two full heaping places of food for 39GBP. Good deal.I'd only suggest more vegan gluten free dessert options. I really wanted something sweet and they had nothing. Also, it was very cold that night and we were able to sit outside as the heat lamps and patio are so cozy that it was tolerable.Also, the indoor lighting is very nice and the bathrooms were clean.I'd for sure return.

Coconut chocolate cream is just lush.I like the seating arrangement: downstairs they have pillows and much more relaxed seating, but I still like the view of the Heddon street if I sit on the ground floor - in the evening it turns into a nice, even romantic place with careful lighting where you can have a nice quiet dinner. During the day it is an awesome place to have a healthy meal on a lazy afternoon for a girly catch up (that's what I intend to do this afternoon at least!).I like the fact that they mark all food as to whether it's vegan, vegetarian, has gluten etc. I don't feel left out - cause normally most of things on the menus in London have milk and I can only choose a handful of meals or ask a waiter for special arrangements!Although you pick up things from buffet, the service is very attentive - I went there with a friend who has a baby and they were very quick in arranging a baby chair for us!I'm going back there for sure (see above) :)",

    "text": "Tibits is a vegetarian restaurant bar that offers take-away or eat-in. I think it is a great original idea.There is buffet of hot and cold vegetarian food and you serve yourself - as much as you want. Then you weight your plate and pay. Every dish is tagged, the presentation is clean and the options interesting (vegetable tartar, different kinds of hummus, falafel, tofu, lentils...). It is not the usual and boring tomatoes, cucumber, and spinach leaves salad bar. Beware this is not an \"all you can eat buffet\" where you pay one price and can go back as many times as you want.Stars off for the price and the organisation of the place:-I know I know what can I expect, this place is right off Regent's St near Piccadilly Circus, aka THE tourist area, but for a food bar prices are a bit high. Pretty sure you can get same portions for around the same price or less at Whole Foods right down the street. I guess this place is not the best option if you are very hungry.-By the organisation I mean the way the buffet is structured. There is one buffet with cold food and hot food together and it would be much better to split them into two buffets to make the choices clearer and the area less crowded. Detail: dinner prices are a bit higher than lunch. So many it is a better lunch option.In a nutshell: a meat-eater would be happy and satisfied for a meal. Not sure that would turn him/her into a vegetarian though",

Some of the dishes were fabulous and flavorful, others were dry and the end of the dish. Also frustrating was how people cut in line, not allowing others to see and access the whole buffet. It was nice to have so many green choices in London. We stayed for tea, and that allowed for the crowd to die down. Much better.

Tidbits is neatly tucked away of Regent's street, and has some really nice outdoor seating. It's hard to believe that you're inches away from the hustle and bustle of Picadilly Circus or Soho. So bonus points for that.I like places that promote healthy living, and have a variety of dishes to cater for different tastes. Unfortunately for tidbits, a lot of the food is kind of meh, and tastes pretty bland. There are a couple of stand out dishes however, so I wouldn't write this place off completely. The dried green beans are excellent, as are the pasta dishes, and pumpkin and sesame.The guacamole is a major disappointment (why is it so hard to season an avocado???), as is the tahini, and most of the pulses. Would I come back here? I would, but I'd be a bit more selective about what I buy next time around. Oh, and it's not that cheap btw... 2 people for lunch was around 23 pounds.

    "text": "Tibits was a good find.On a day trip to London with a friend, like me a vegetarian, we searched Yelp beforehand to check out suitable places in the centre where we could get a decent lunch. It's hard to believe that this is in a side road from the hustle and bustle of Regent Street as the atmosphere was laid back and fairly peaceful (during the day anyway), even when sitting outside.We were greeted at the door by a terribly well spoken gentleman (who reminded us of Jeffrey Archer) who could sense our initial confusion. We could find no menu, or indication of prices. \"It's a visual menu,\" he declared, indicating a central island stocked with dozens of delicious looking vegetarian dishes. We tittered a little at the pomposity, but tucked in.It seemed to be an all-you-can-eat buffet, and we were still a little bemused to find no prices. But all became clear when we went to the bar to order our drinks and we were asked to put our full plates on scales to have them weighed. It was a fairly reasonable price for us as we had a 25% discount using my Gourmet Society card. Having said that, we weren't inclined to return to refill our plates and pay more..The food, however, was really healthy, and very tasty. I would definitely return next time to sample other dishes on the 'visual menu'. Definitely recommended.",

There is a big 'food boat' in the centre with all sorts of dishes covering the boat. Every item has the allergens listed on a little card and the staff are vere knowledgeable about all the ingredients. Essentially the place is one big buffet so you grab a plate, load it up and it's charged by weight. Their desserts aren't super friendly to ask allergen sufferers but at the end of the day they're a veggie restaurant not an allergy restaurant. I'd certainly recommend checking it out.",

    "text": "I've been meaning to try this place for some time and finally made it here tonight. This place is great - like a Whole Foods salad bar on crack, with prices to match. An upscale salad bar/veggie buffet with a great variety of choices that range from lighter (raw veggies with a pesto dressing, greek salad, etc.) to more substantial (thai aubergine green curry, lyonnaise potatoes, etc.). You pay by weight so definitely be mindful in your decision-making process. They also have great looking juices and desserts. The restaurant itself is bright and cozy, great for meeting up with friends and I noticed you can even reserve tables. The no-fuss self-service method coupled with this casual but nice ambiance makes this experience enjoyable and efficient without feeling like you're in a cafeteria. I basically got a small bite's worth of a lot of things, but my favorites were:- quinoa peruvian salad- lyonnaise potatoes - dried green bean salad - aubergine curryI must point out that I'm not a vegetarian, but the food was so good, I didn't even notice the lack of meat options on offer.",

Perfect alternative your usual bar snacks or ideal for lunch, perhaps as I've done to start a night out slowly. The self service concept of where they weigh your food and then you pay is cool, NO WASTE. Add a nicely done low lit interior with large windows and plenty of outdoor seating for smokers and non smokers and you will see why this is for me a perfect hideaway in central London.",

    "text": "I have been here twice in one week! My sister and I both are not vegetarians but love Tibits. There are a lot of different fresh salads and warm vegetarian dishes that you can choose from. You fill your plate at the buffet, and they weight it and you pay before you eat. The type of food really varied, they had everything from salad, quinoa, cous cous, cold pasta salad, lentils/bean salads, and then mashed potatoes, onion rings, sweet potato, focaccia, samosa, warm veggie dishes, soup and fresh rolls, fruit, etc. Our plates were both around 9-10 pounds for a full meal (plate filled but not piled high). They have a number of different fresh fruit juices, and really good coffee to go with your meal. Tibits is in a pretty alley behind Regent street that also has lots of other nice-looking restaurants. It has a large patio, first floor and basement to sit in so unless it is really busy you shouldn't have trouble finding seating. You can also pack a take away box for a meal to go.",

We left feeling hungry and ripped off.I am a big fan of interestingly cooked and prepared vegetarian food, but you can now get this type of food at Fresh & Wild.No wonder the place was empty - we were jealously looking across the road to the queues outside ever-popular Momo.While I remember the Swiss original to be quite cosy, the London branch feels like an upmarket office buffet.I don't think this will catch on.The food's OK, but money would be much better spent somewhere else.",

As a vegan, I'm always left with very few options but this place threw my decision dependency for a loop. There were so many vegan options and they were all delicious! Highly highly recommend!",

Needless to say, that I simply had to go and check it out, despite the fact that it is in tourist central - aka Regent Street!I have to admit that I was a bit let down by Tibits: I'd expected a whole-in-the wall place, where they would offer various salads and other vegetarian dishes in a somewhat casual/alternative environment. Well, far from that: what I found was a place that looked rather corporate-y and not very appealing to be honest...plain.The buffet was generous and the portions are priced by weight. And it ain't cheap...well, it's London central, so I guess they have to charge more, but I would get a much tastier selection for less than half of the price at \"Caf\u00e9 43\" in Farringdon.Final verdict: if you're in the area and want to grab a quick and healthy bite, by all means try this place out. But let me tell you - there are much better places around!",

    "text": "I was taken here recently by a friend for dinner, and am happy to report that it is now added to my regular list of vegetarian restaurants to visit.The concept is simple: there is a buffet of mixed vegetarian dishes. You take a plate, make your choice, and then take it to the counter to get it weighed. \u00a0You are then given a tray and can order drinks at the bar. You can choose both mains and desserts in one trip, or do them separately (I'd recommend the latter). A bread roll (including a gluten free choice) is included in the price.The course of mains was excellent - a good mix of basic salads, alongside vegetarian dishes from around the world. Most of them were excellent, tasty and well thought-through, though one of the aubergine dishes was under-cooked for my liking. I found the choice of desserts a little less exciting - you can't go wrong with fruit, but I would have liked custard to go with a couple of the steamed puddings. That said, it is easy to get carried away on the mains and so not have room for dessert. A generous selection of mains for me came to \u00a315.70, and a 250ml glass of decent sauvignon was \u00a36.30. The only downside to the whole process is having to queue with your plate for your food (and it meant we had to take it in turns to get our food, so as not to leave our possessions unattended).What I really like is that the restaurant itself makes an effort to provide nice, classy surroundings - it's slightly informal, but a wonderful change from the \"shabby-chic\" approach that predominates in most veggie venues. There's a generous patio at the front for outdoor dining - which is particularly attractive as Heddon Street is pedestrianised and so traffic free.",

We were scheduled to go somewhere else, however, there was a dress code not mentioned on the site or yelp, however, it ended up being a blessing in disguise cause we got to discover this great place. This is a vegetarian place with some vegan and gluten free options. The concept is that you take a plate (or boat as they call it) and pick items from the trays. Go to the cashier and weigh it.We came for dinner, therefore, we were charged 2,70 per 100g. A modest plate cost us 9 pounds. The desserts had some traditional English desserts, therefore, I was able to get a few sweet treats knocked off the bucket list.The atmosphere was a fine line between casual and semi fine dining at night without the pretentious feel.You can even order some good coffee and high end cocktails.Very friendly staff.There are two floors. Peter and I sat on the main level to get a more feel for the place but if you're feeling introverted there's a table for you down in the basement.",

Various cuisines mixed in together due to overzealous patrons dropping some of their scoops? Unnatural colors that look more like they belong in a bucket of paint? Yeah no thanks. Even in Las Vegas, the heart of buffet food, I actively shudder at the mention of attending one. Thankfuly Tibits is not that kind of buffet. Upon walking in, one is greeted with the smell of fresh food that is beautifully prepared and labeled accordingly. Everything looks good. I don't think I've ever stuffed my plate with so many different options. And it's all vegetarian! \u00a0From a variety of salads (loved the Asian slaw and beluga lentil salad) to entrees (mmm spiced vegetable & chickpea tangine) to desserts, there's plenty for everyone. My husband and I went here when we visited London a few years ago and couldn't wait to go back on our most recent visit. Yeah, it was that good. You also pay by weight so there's no need to overstuff your plate just to get your money's worth.. Just be careful, with so many tasty looking options, Tibits can get very costly!",

    "text": "Great place, will most likely go back this week. Good things are : - Vegetarian place that does not look too vegan, and it is rare in the city. - location : right in the center where you end up spending a lot of time, and where finding a spot where you can actually come in with no reservation is hard to find.- concept : a food bar where you make your plate and pay per weight, like at Whole Foods- a nice selection of dishes AND you also have access to a full bar (see the vegan that does not look too vegan point)- and the food was good. Lots of salads, already cooked meals etc.It is very casual and you end up paying a bit too much for such a casual spot, though it is such a nice alternative to everything around that area that it deserves the 4 stars. Oh they also have space downstairs and unless super crowded, I think you should be able to be sited right upon arrival. Enjoy,",

Most of the buffet restaurants I've encountered have never really been all that aesthetically pleasing, so I was really surprised when we set foot in Tibits. It has a very contemporary feel to it and you immediately feel welcome. Surrounded by slightly livelier bars and restaurants, it's a cosy and trendy escape from the busy streets surrounding it.goo.gl/jRftmZ",

Initially I enjoyed the novelty of having a buffet that you can pick and choose what and how much food you want on your plate, I loved that in hotels when I was little, and the fact that you just pay by weight, so there's no dish that's more expensive and you can pay according to how much you wish to eat. The food itself is all delicious and you get to try lots of different dishes so there is something there for everyone. They also have a very nice juice selection and organic beer. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the furniture looks very pretty in pastel colours and rustic elements. When it's warm you can sit outside and enjoy the sun and fresh air and it does make you forget you are at the heart of central London.",

It was clean and roomy, and I liked the overall vibe. 4/5SELECTION: It's all vegetarian (but they have labels for which are vegan, along with some other allergy notifications) and it's like a hot food bar, where you put whatever you want on a plate and then they weigh it, and you pay per 100g. There are 40 different dishes offered daily, including salads, hot dishes, and desserts. They also have drinks and cocktails. 3/5WHAT I GOT: From what I remember/can see from my picture, I got white rice, mixed greens, bok choy, a grilled veggies mix, a green beans mix, a potatoes and peas mix and some of an artichoke dish. All of the stuff I got was vegan. It was all pretty good and tasted fresh and of good quality -- in fact, it was probably the best buffet/hot food type bar I've ever been to. None of it tasted like it'd been sitting out for a while, and none of it was undercooked or tasted too processed. The only complaint I have is that I wish they refrained from using oil, but it actually could've been much worse, so that's that. 3/5SERVICE: The employees seemed friendly. I mean, we didn't really need to interact with them much, given the style of eatery, but they seemed nice lol. 4/5",

The atmosphere is great and the service is friendly, but unfortunately I was majorly disappointed by the food. The vegetables weren't cooked well at all. A lot of them were too hard and the roasted corn was this terrible chewy/hard consistency. The meatballs were so dry they were practically inedible. The falafel was also extremely dry and the consistency was just really off. In addition, many of the hot dishes were not actually hot and some of the dishes that were intentionally cold, like Indian Dal, should really be served warm. Overall, I might be willing to give their brunch a try but otherwise would definitely not be back.",

At the end the manager was powerless to offer us any more than 10% off our bill - apparently the blob was also capable of mind control! You have been warned!!",

The place looks very nice and there was a lot of seating, it wasn't full.I would recommend because there is not so many vegan places in the area for this price and the food was ok it was filling , but I wasn't amazed, the food wasn't so exciting even though we didn't try everything.

They have a huge buffet and the ambiance was nice. A server came up and was asking us if it was our first time there and started explaining what to do, and he said everything was vegetarian. EVERYTHING. Score! They had such interesting stuff, and it all tasted very fresh. You get a plate and get whatever you want, then go to the bar and they weigh your stuff and you get your utensils and drink. Even our 3 year old liked the food. And, if the food wasn't enough of a draw, downstairs they have a kid's play area, complete with chalkboard and toys, and couches for the parents. Another must-visit place for our next trip to London.",

So I did. Really fantastic decor, lovely vibe (opposite trendy Momo's), but I'm not sure the food lived up to the promise. Love the concept, really healthy vegetarian food in a modern setting, rather than going down the hippy route (why does everyone think veggie's are hippies who love cheese with everything?), but something about the food didn't grab me. It was nice, but I can think of other better veggie restaurants I'd rather go to like Food for Thought. The salad bar has loads of choice and I actually had food envy and probably should have opted for this, but instead I went for an antipasti sandwich stuffed with aubergine, sundried tomato and pesto + a small hungarian vegetable soup. Tasty but didn't blow me away. I also had a rather nice bowl (bowl??) of flowering Jasmine tea, which was perfectly fragrant and sweet. So on paper I should absolutely love this place - cool setting, good service, veggie cuisine and lots of herbal teas, but something about it didn't excite me. Very pricey too.",

I should have known really, nestled among the trendy eateries on Heddon Street off Regent Street, this place would hit the wallet hard. Inside it has a modern, funky feel (interior by London designer Tricia Guild). People were just chilling and enjoying the relaxed, laid back attitude. A very cute server met me at the door and eyeing my quizzical expression, offered to tell me about the place. Marketing themselves as conceptual dining and 'food that loves you back' they have a pay by weight 'food boat' of delicious hot and cold foods. But they also encourage you to just come in and have a drink and with the cool cocktail menu and outdoor seating area, I am very tempted to do just that. The trays of GM Free veggie salads, paella, quiche, tofu, chutneys and fresh fruit are of the best quality and really tasty. Try the fresh strawberries smothered in chocolate coconut mousse, you can thank me later. It's only getting three stars because it is so expensive, \u00a37 for a moderately filled plate. My own rookie mistake, you never get a cheap 'pay by weight' meal. But this place is very cool and well worth a visit, even if it is a chain.",

The restaurant operates a self-service veggie buffet and vegetarian or not you're spoiled for choice. Hot food is placed on the top of the buffet, with a selection of salads at the bottom. Although I got stuck in and tried pretty much everything - I have to particularly recommend the cheesy jalapenos, the South Indian curry and the fantastic cheese quiche - yes, it's the sort of place where you can mix curry and quiche and not feel bad about it! Tibits also has a fantastic selection of home-cooked deserts, I had apple pie with lashings of cream, while my partner selected a slice of baked cheesecake - also heavy on the cream. Tibits is licensed and sells a selection of cocktails, but their homemade ginger lemonade was worth going sober for. I'm not a vegetarian, but my Dad is so I'll definitely take him here next time he comes to London - maybe then he can foot the bill!",

However, I was not able to get a second plate or dessert as we (incorrectly) thought we still had an hour until closing. \u00a0I wish someone had given the remaining patrons notice that they were packing up the food and desserts and offer a last chance. \u00a0They also started cleaning up and just took away the candle at our table even though we were still dining. \u00a0 In the end, the dimmed lights were turned up and the remaining few tables took that as our cue to leave. \u00a0Aside from the lack of service, fortunately food wise, the buffet-style options are good for vegetarians and vegans when in London.",

    "text": "I was invited to an engagement party by a couple of my friends who have just got engaged (surprisingly enough). The lovely lady of the pair is vegan, so it wasn't much of a surprise when they announced they were going to have it at a place that did vegetarian/vegan food.Although there were many jokes from myself and a few others suggesting we would bring a shaker with bacon bits in (I'm sure they exist) to make sure we got a meat fix, I was actually really looking forward to Tibits. I've only ever been to an Indian veggie place before so it would be good to try some different cuisine and see what she made such a fuss about!I turned up and in customary style at such an event all of their friends who had been invited quickly sat at tables with people from their social group, and so I ended up on a table (well, initiated it) with a load of others who I've known for ages. It was all going well, we'd got some beers in, which were organic and pretty good actually, and we decided to head up and get some food.What we hadn't realised that it was a pick n mix buffet type arrangement, and we soon hunted round to find the one place that told you how much it all cost \u00a0\u00a32.20 per 100g!! Extortion (I thought) for some cooked vegetables, however we soldiered on and filled up our plates with a bit of everything, not quite sure how much it would cost until we got to the till. My plate of food, which was by no means full, set me back \u00a312.90, though I was told beforehand to make sure I got my free (but tiny) bread roll, which I did.We headed back downstairs to eat as that area had been reserved for us all and tucked in. The food was pretty good, I especially liked their sauces and the jalapeno bites, as well as the quinoa and their vegetable Thai red curry and rice. Some of it was a bit bland, but in my effort to ensure I didn't miss out on anything good I had got a bit of almost everything which meant while quality was sometimes poor, the variety was there to keep my simple male mind entertained.The other thing keeping me entertained was the decor \u00a0the place looked great and with their flock wallpaper all over the place I could stroke the walls and not look (too much) like a child. I was intrigued by their collection of board games up the corner, obviously there in case you come on a date and the conversation isn't going anywhere, and also their swinging lights above the tables. We put these to good use swinging them onto each other to carry out mock-Spanish-Inquisitions. It kept us amused.Anyway, the food was good, and some of my friends went up for pudding, though I wasn't keen on the idea of \u00a322/kg fruit so I opted for another pint instead, and a bit later on got bought a mojito which was very well made with Havana Club rum (my favourite!) so I went home happy at the end of the evening.Unfortunately happy was not the order of the day when I woke up, as something had definitely disagreed with me. I obviously won't Qype about my bowel habits, but by luck and planning I was seeing all the same friends again the day after the meal and was surprised to hear that all of them hadn't been feeling right either. It was good to know that it was the food and not just my shoddy GI system, but saddening to know that my first real foray into vegetarian food had ended up with what must have been some badly cooked vegetables (if that's even possible). We suspect that as it is a buffet style arrangement, some of the food may have been there a little too longSo in conclusion, a great looking place, with food that tastes good (though very pricey) when you're eating it, but on this occasion it wasn't a happy place the day after. Most likely I won't be going back!",

    "text": "An oasis of calm and vegetarian goodness just a few feet away from the bustling crowds of tourists on Regent street. I must admit, I'm a bit ashamed to say that I've lived in London for almost 3 years now and walked down this street dozens of times, yet until this week never even knew the Regent Square existed let alone that it had some interesting places to eat. A 10 second walk away from the insane crowds of tourists and shoppers on Regent street, this square seems almost forgotten by comparison. What drew me here was noticing a sign of Tidbits, and the intriguing byline of paying for your food by weight. The only other time I did this was at Coopers in Austin, TX which is a BBQ joint where you get the food straight from the BBQ pit and onto your tray. Great times, so the idea of weighing food again was appealing.We walked in, grabbed a seat in the slightly hippy decorated place, and then filled our plates at the food \"island\" (approximately 40 vegetarian dishes from salads to quiche to indian pastries to breads). You then take your plate and stick it on a scale which calculates the weight. I couldn't tell if the plate itself was included in the weight (which may be how they account for the price difference between eat-in and take out) but at \u00a32/100g it's a pricey plate rental. The food itself was quite tasty ranging from potato salad to glazed chestnuts to a non-oily samosa to leek and potato quiche. I would have preferred more hot dishes (there are maybe 2-3 out of the 40, one being potato wedges) but overall the cold dishes do add to the healthy feel. My plate came to \u00a39 which was enough food for a decent lunch but would be severely lacking for a filling dinner.The mango lassie was smooth and sweet with a mild mango flavour that was nicely tempered by the cardamon powder. That hit me for another \u00a33 bringing my total damage to \u00a312. For an occasional lunch, it's not a bad deal and worth keeping in mind when shopping in the area.Note: They do take reservations but only for groups of 8 or more according to the menu",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went there on Saturday for lunch, as I'd been recommended it and it happened to be on my 'to try' list. They had a large buffet (to be fair, a v good selection of stuff- salad, pasta, bread, chips, hummus, guac, noodles, etc etc etc). There was a decent amount of vegan stuff, but I still thought there could have been a lot more, and a lot of the vegetarian stuff easily could have been made vegan and not lost any of it's appeal. There were pretty much no desserts suitable for vegans, unless you count fruit salad. Bit of a shame. You pay by weight.. and ours cost \u00a315 each, which was an absolute rip off for what it was (a tiny bread roll, hummus, guacamole, some pasta, about 4 potato wedges). I can't eat huge portions, so I know the amount of food I had really wasn't much at all. I would have been happy if it had been about \u00a38, but for double that price, I was pretty shocked. My boyfriend said it was bland (I actually disagree, I think the food was good, and seasoned/flavoured really nicely, bar the guacamole - mine is 100x better unfortunately!)The actual restaurant was nice, and the atmosphere was cool - pretty much a posh canteen, I guess. Without sounding rude, I have noticed a lot of people here saying 'it doesn't get better than this for veggie/vegan food in London' - ummmm I hate to break it to you, but this was the worst vegan experience I've had in London, and I don't understand how someone would think it doesn't get better than Tibits! There are a trillion places in this city that are incredible for vegans, and affordable! see my 'favourites' for some examples!)I just couldn't get over the price of it. I wouldn't go back. Sorry, Tibits.",

I spent my first day in London in a touristy area having a really tough time finding vegan food, and when I finally did find it it was bland and boring... but on my second day, I found Tibits and it was heaven.As you go around the buffet-style serving area, you can load your plate full with whatever you want. I found some mediterranean, American, Italian, Mexican... I can't remember the last time I had vegan onion rings, a delicious lemon pudding, or something resembling lasagna. I had a really tough time not going back for more. This place is absolutely perfect, and being from the US, I'm totally jealous of Londoners who have access to this place every day. I know I'd be there every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner if I could.The seating is fantastic too! There's lovely seating outside, and plenty inside (including a lower level). Rock on, tibits!

You pay by weight and they offer a variety of salads and hot vegetarian options every day. Compared to the standard lunch options (Pret, Eat, Crussh, Itsu, etc), this lunch feels fresh and different. I think this is partly due to the constant rotation of salads. The salads which often include ingredients like quinoa, lentils, chickpeas, and a variety of vegetables rarely disappoint. Don't overlook the hot options as well! One of my favorites was a vegan (yes, vegan!) risotto.",
