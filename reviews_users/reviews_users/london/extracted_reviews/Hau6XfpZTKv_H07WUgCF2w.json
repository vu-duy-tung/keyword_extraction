Quiet drink with one colleague after work? Go ahead and pay The Albert a visit. Want to catch up with a group of friends? Go somewhere else.",

It's a friendly sight to tourists, but not offensive to locals (though they do make a point of advertising their afternoon tea). Because of it's close proximity to the station and Westminster Cathedral, it iis busy all day every day, and for that reason alone it might not really be worth your bother. But if you find yourself needing to meet someone for a meal or a drink before the speed out of town, youo could definitely do worse.",

There were quite a few tourists around maybe due to its location. Hearing so many negative things about fish n chips, I braced myself to try it...turns out it was pretty good, not too greasy and no bone in my fish...though yes it would be boring to have a whole plate by myself. My friend and I also had some kind of lamb stew, as well as a dish of chicken with rice. We thought both were pretty tasty, but seemed more like ethnic food than local fare.The restaurant upstairs and the ground level pub offer a variety of dishes for (relatively) reasonable prices. The restaurant also offers some kind of carved meat buffet for \u00a311.25. And the pub offers afternoon tea all day/night =).",

These cool looking restaurants are located throughout the city (We also ate at The White Swan before we realized the catch) and the decor, location and theme are all so perfect that you can't resist, but then you realize that the menu in each of these restaurants is the same and it's a chain equivalent to Applebee's and then you are all, \"DOH! I'm eating at the London version of Sizzler.\" Restaurant choice fail. Now, it's not that I am totally against the idea of frequenting chains; it's just that I would really rather spend my money at a locally owned small business and I feel that this chain definitely tricks people! With that being said...the traditional London pie with mash and veggies was surprisingly tasty, even if I did have to walk up to the counter to order and then be served buffet style. No table service for food in the downstairs pub area. I cannot speak for the upstairs restaurant as we only ate in the Pub. -2 stars for chain menu trickery. -1 star for self service at table service prices.",

From the outside, it is a classic, large, Victorian pub. The interior is impressive, too: high ceilings, elaborate decoration, with lots of polished wood and etched glass. And it serves a decent selection of real ales, too. It's what every package tourist thinks an English pub should be. That, as you may have guessed, is its problem. It's a favourite of tourist coach parties and, after they've arrived, service can be a very slow and tedious affair. Staff can be friendly, but too often they just look bored. It's pricier than other venues in the area too. Worth a pint, maybe, to see the interior, but I'd suggest the nearby Buckingham Arms or Cask & Glass if you want an enjoyable evening.",

Anyhow, on this day they had a band called Rockabellas a nostalgic group of three girls who performed just brilliantly. I am in the catering business and let me tell you this was a rocking class pub day. Beers were fine, upstairs carvery, have to be truthful basic but you know \u00a311 quid something a....what do you expect? Too be frank food was far off what id call fabulous but ya know it was not a fabulous silly high price session either. Atmosphere in the pub was just fabulous, packed for the special occasion (remembrance day) the band were stunning I mean the business!!! (Cannot over emphasise this too much) The staff were in period 1940's costume hair make up....all in all just the business!! Anyhow, all of this flys in the face of previous reviews (Which none the less I respect) but you have to speak how you find. The occasion I was there, one time or what.... \"This was a true master class in how to run a pub A stunning day in the pub just about as good as it gets. Simple as that!",

Ornate furnishings and original gas lighting (updated to include light bulbs) make The Albert a lovely pub to sit in. However, there are too few beers, and those that are present are overpriced. The food appears to be mainly microwaved and this lets the pub down somewhat. The proximity of The Albert to Westminster means that it is a regular tourist stop, somewhat detracting from its cosiness. This, along with the particularly rude bar staff - try getting served without a sneer - make it an uncomfortable experience after a hard day's work.

They should call the fish and chips, \"whale and chips\" because it is huge! The atmosphere was like nothing I've seen before. It was raining heavily outside which made it even more cozy inside with the dim lighting. I felt like I was in a Charles Dickens novel. I know, cliche, I'm American, this is as close as I'll ever get. I was reading this place is part of a chain. I wish the chains in the states looked like this place, gorgeous. The building itself is worth taking a peek at (sneak in to use the bathroom and have a looksy). It's this giant beautiful brick building and every thing inside is wood with this great wallpaper and gold trim everywhere. Check out the curtains and each detail on the walls. If the beef and ale pie wasn't so amazing, I could've sat in this place for hours just taking it in. 5 Stars!",

After a baked potato, glass of wine, and consumption of the free wi-fi, I fell in love and have been back several times. The ambiance is so cozy and old-pub-y. It doesn't seem like a tourist trap to me, because from what I could tell mostly locals were there whenever I went, and my British coworkers like it too. I've only been in the downstairs, because the upstairs restaurant seems too formal for me and doesn't have a menu I'm interested in.It's true that downstairs they don't provide table service, but from what I've experienced this is fairly common in British pubs. Not such a weird thing.The food is delicious. I was super excited to see a vegetarian fish n chips option (made with halloumi cheese), which I've yet to find anywhere else, and it was yummy - a little too greasy, but still good. And I love the sides, desserts, and wine selection. I plan on going back many more times.",

The James's Park train stop is definitely a quiet area on the weekends.We came here with 2 babies and it was fun seeing the looks we received as we walked into the pub while everyone was having a good time with a drink. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and it definitely gives you that England spirit.There was a room in the back bottom floor that was empty and quiet. We were able to enjoy our fish and chips (don't be deceived by it only containing one piece, it's basically the whole cod), my husband had the roast beef (super tender) and my brother in law had the beef pie (yummy crust). A few of us had mashed potatoes and mashed peas along with other variations of sizes.The portions are huge. The prices are about 3-4 pounds more than the other similar restaurants serving these dishes, but I don't know about the portioning.My only complaint is that the fish and chips lacked flavor. There was absolutely no seasoning on anything. The peas were actually the most flavorful part of the dish. The batter was tasteless although the texture and crunch were good. This was a bit disappointing for me. The other dishes were good.",

What we found was the quintessential British pub in every way. All of the wood, brass and leather appointments gave the place a slightly formal but still warm, inviting atmosphere. We were there in late November and they had already decorated for the holidays, which added a nice touch. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and even tolerated our teen kids in tow. We enjoyed a hearty, warm lunch of typical pub fare and a pint before heading back into the cold. It was a brief, but enjoyable stop. Very nice place and we will definitely visit again when in London.",

    "text": "Can you rate below one star? I don't know how to do that. Likely the worst place I've ever eaten. In New York, this place would close after the first month. Awful food, worse (and rude) service. After we endured that, we paid the bill IN FULL AND EVEN WITH A SMALL TIP, and were accosted and grabbed and accused of not paying!!! How long should one wait for an attendant....or whatever you would call the person tending to clients.....to collect the check or even check the service? TERRIBLE PLACE...,,worse than a tourist trap. STAY AWAY!!!! I am a foodie and go to the best restaurants in the world! \u00a0This place was a disaster! I was actually physically grabbed on steep stairs without anyone having checked the table! This is a shameful place for London. I hope there is better.And after a very verbal confrontation and my 72 year old husband going back up the stairs to get the bill and the payment which had been left on the table, there was not even an apology! We are in agreement that this was the worst dining experience either of us have had on three continents. Rather than London, visit the US, Paris, Canne,Nice, Broughes, Amsterdam, Jerusalem, Jordan. You'll be treated better and have far better food!We were accused of stealing! I can't believe it. In retrospect, WE were stolen from because of the horrible service and horrible food. PLEASE STAY AWAY!!!!",

My dish was about 10 pounds, and I got a cider (which was great too) for 5 pounds. Great place and great food for an even better price!",

    "text": "I was blessed to visit London last spring and stay in Westminster. Our first day there we arrived in the evening and decided to take a stroll. We rounded a corner after leaving our hotel and much to our pleasant surprise we stumbled across this adorable building that was The Albert. We decided after the long flight and travel that we wanted to go upstairs to a table and order. What ambiance. This place is now one of the peaceful happy places in my mind that I go to to destress some days. I suppose that is why I'm taking the time to write this review some months later. From the fire blazing in the fire place on that cold night to the candles burning around the room we instantly felt welcomed and warmed.Our servers were super friendly, welcoming us to the country. As to ordering, of course, I ordered the fish and chips what with it being the first meal in London and all. It was the best fish and chips I have ever had and I am now hesitant to ever order it anywhere again. It was gorgeous. Flavorful and just yum. My companions ordered the bangers and mash and the steak and kidney pie. To die for. They also have a Carvery on Sundays. We made this spot our home away from home while we visited, eating there several times, and we got to know the staff a bit. They gave us great pointers and walking paths to take in the sites. The Albert will always hold a special place in my heart. Should I find myself in London again it is definitely on my must do list. It is just off the district line at St James Park station. Do yourself a favor and go.",

    "text": "Loved this authentic pub in Victoria. \u00a0Beautiful interior and exterior, bringing you back to Victorian times.I do agree that there aren't many beer options, however, I had a couple of pints of a lighter beer that I quite enjoyed. The food is NOT microwaved as someone else here has indicated. The fish and chips were amazing - a GIANT, FRESH piece of battered cod served with crisp fries and green peas. It was perfectly light and crisp. Delicious. \u00a0I had a beef and ale pie which was incredibly crisp and buttery on the outside and beefy/saucy on the inside. This was served with mashed potatoes and gravy and fresh mixed vegetables. Our other friend had the roast beef dinner which was like prime rib here in the states served with mashed potatoes, roasted potatoes, mixed vegetables and yorkshire pudding. A LOT of food for the money.Prices EXTREMELY reasonable - fish and chips 13.99GBP, my steak pie $13.99GBP, the roast beef dinner i think was 15.99GBP.The pub is extremely busy and loud (which is part of the atmosphere). Service a bit slow but very friendly. Oh - and bathrooms are down a spiral staircase in the basement (quite a challenge if you've had too much to drink I am sure).Must try if you're looking for a great pub experience while visiting London",
