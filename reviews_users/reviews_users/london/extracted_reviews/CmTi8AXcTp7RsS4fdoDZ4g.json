Most of the reviews talk of London terror attacks not very promising... It's a real low barn style dive of a place. A log cabin style new to me and not clean. The beers were flat and glasses not clean. We shared a bit of chocolate fudge cake for \u00a35.50 it was not worth the 50p. Better to get back on the tube to Bayswater and have a fun night out without the risk of catching something.",

You just have to pick the least crappy beer and go with it - painfully, the price is pretty expensive (though average for London). I like Cleveland Arms much much better. I also like the Sussex Arms better as well. They both have better beers and more enjoyable atmospheres (including better service). Lastly, the wine selection is weak and SUPER pricey. I end up being FORCED to drink the weak beer selections while there b/c the wine is so expensive. Boo. Hoo.",

The meat and sauce on it was great, but I was a bit confused as to how it was a pie when it was just a piece of bread at the top...On interesting thing that I saw on the menu that I didn't get to try was that you can take a challenge where you pay \u00a320 and if you finish the plate in 20 minutes by yourself, it's free. It might be worth doing that if you're really hungry and can eat very fast. One of the dishes that I recall on that part of the menu was pasta and given the large portions that I got for the beef and ale pie, I can't imagine how much pasta \u00a320 will buy you.On the downside, the place does have a mandatory 12.5% service charge if you get table service which is a bit high compared to the other pubs, but it's somewhat understandable given that the place is right across from Paddington Station and get somewhat crowded.",

Decor isnt much as its just a standard pub and service is limited. Theres menus scattered randomly around the place and the menu is displayed on a board on the wall. As soon as you know what you want to order you walk up to the cashier to order and pay. As soon as the food is ready theyll come bring it to wherever your sitting.

I ordered the long braised beef cheek and it turned out to be a good choice! Especially on a cold and rainy night. Everything had the right texture and flavour. Fresh broccoli and carrots (not soggy like other places) the mash was good and the beef and sauce was lovely. It was a better experience than expected, to be honest.",

Waited for over 5 mins and not a single waiter came to us.Guess we are brown skinned so the waitress there chose to ignore us. Me & my wife kept calling out but the waiter at the bar ignored us as well. (The place had probably 5-10 ppl dining in there at that time probably) I decided to leave and go the the cafe next door. The owner next door actually invited us in with a smile on his face and the staff there were super pleasant! (Cafe Dylan Dog).We've been living on this street since over 3 days and have tried various joints on this street.I rather give business to restaurants who appreciate and have 0 tolerance to racism.SHAME to see racism still exists around London.This place should be renamed to \"SHAME OF PADDINGTON\" instead of \"Pride of Paddington\"NEVER STEPPING IN. Highly not recommended. Would rate it a negative -10",

    "text": "My family and I came to this restaurant about 45 minutes before the kitchen closed (it closed at 10:30 PM). Upon arrival, no one sat us down. We had to approach the bartender who told us we should seat ourselves and that a waitress would come by. The waitress asked if anyone sat us and apologized for the lack of service. When she came to take our orders, we asked for two more minutes. She never came back. We had to ask another worker to take our orders. My mom ordered the fish and chips served with a side salad, my brother ordered the beef and ale pie which came with mashed potatoes or chips, and I ordered the scampi with chips and side salad. We asked the waitress if we could switch out the chips for mashed potatoes. She replied rudely and said she would ask the chef. Since she was so hesitant, my brother said if that was not possible, then he would order mash potatoes. She said that it would not be possible for my brother and mom to switch sides because the mash potatoes will be served under the pie. I don't understand why she couldn't just ask the chef to put them on the side. My mom's fish and chips were horrible. We tried fish and chips earlier from a food stand which my mom thought was better. The fish was soggy as if it had been sitting around or that it was soaking in oil because it was cooked when the oil was not hot. The batter of the fish was wet and soggy. It was not crispy at all. My mom had to pick around it and only eat the fish. Her mash potatoes were dry. They did not come with gravy. Both the fish and mash potatoes were flavorless. My mom ended up feeling sick and throwing up in the bathroom.My brother's beef and ale pie was subpar. The \"pie\" as another reviewer stated is literally chunks of beef topped with a piece of bread. There is nothing that binds the \"pie\" together. Although, it was nice that the vegetables were surprisingly fresh. There was no flavor to any of it. In addition, his chips were served underneath the \"pie\" which left the chips soggy and wet, defeating the purpose of frying. My scampi arrived 20 minutes after my mom and brother's food came. I was sitting around watching them eat and then they had to sit and watch me eat since our food came out at different times. I will admit that a different waitress addressed the problem, apologized, and offered a drink on the house. The scampi was clearly frozen, prepackaged food that was taken out of the freezer and fried. The chips were mushy and flavorless. Everything was flavorless and extremely oil. I was so hungry that I forced myself to eat it, but it still did not taste good. I would not recommend this restaurant at all. Most of the staff were friendly, but the food was absolutely horrible. It was the worst food I have ever tasted. My brother and I agreed that having Burger King would have been significantly better. My mom ended up spending the rest of the night in our hotel after puking out all the food. All in all, we spent 40 pounds on food that I could have made at home from a frozen box. I truly hope that this restaurant is not the pride of Paddington.",

    "text": "**This review is for the hostel only**I stayed here for a night and it wasn't bad at all. The people that work here are very nice. I got there before noon, too early to check in, but they held my luggage for me while I went sightseeing. They will also hold your bag for a bit after you check out, which was quite helpful for me since I wanted to grab lunch w/ a friend before heading over to Paddington Station.Speaking of Paddington, it is CRAZY close to the station, which is very convenient if you need to catch a train to/from Heathrow or a neighboring city like Oxford or Bath. It's also close to Kensington Gardens and a couple of miles away from Buckingham Palace. If you go on a nice day and don't mind walking, it's a beautiful walk through the parks.I paid a bit extra for a female only dorm. My room was comfortable enough considering it's a hostel. You will need to bring a padlock for the lockers and they won't hold an average sized suitcase, but they are still big enough for other things. Honestly, my roommates were cool, I probably didn't even have to worry about the locker, but hey, better safe than sorry. The bathrooms were...meh. The shower near my room was private but good lord, was that water scalding hot! I just couldn't figure out how to work the shower without getting scalded or freezing! The larger bathroom were either unisex or we had some confused guys on our floors but there is a smaller, tackier bathroom. Yes, the sinks here are weird, but this seems to be more of a UK thing as opposed to something wrong w/ this hostel. Compared to a couple of hostels I've stayed in in the US, this place had ZERO bugs that i saw. Nada, not even in the bathroom (I still have nightmares about the house centipedes I kept finding at a hostel in Chicago!). Yes, you get a free breakfast coupon with your choice of a full English breakfast, pancakes, cereal, or eggs, along w/ either juice or coffee. It was nothing memorable, but hey, free food! Major warning!: the hostel occupies 2-3 floors above the restaurant. These are steep, twisty, \u00a0and narrow stairs. Beware if you're carrying a large piece of luggage! Great place overall, very inexpensive and I would book again if I'm ever in London again and need a cheap place to crash but am not positive I could do this place long term (i.e., 3+ days).",

    "text": "This has been a staple boozer around Paddington Station to wait or meet at. Really nothing should be simpler at a pub than providing good drinks and service likewise, when something does unfortunately go wrong, normally it's incredibly easy to put right.So you would have thought that if you had bought a glass of wine but find it to be 'corked' (not in the true sense of corked but 'off' as if it had been opened, left around for a week unchilled and then stuck back in the fridge) you would get offered a replacement or alternative.However in our case it seemed that as my friend had returned to the bar after the final bell had gone (we had arrived and bought just before) staff were intent on ignoring you completely and when the attention of one was got, my friend was told it was 'time' and left there.He carried on waiting patiently and eventually a senior staff member confronted my friend and practised on him the art of how to be unreasonable making the word 'service' akin to finding a golden goose.On this note, we quietly left leaving the wine unfinished behind on the bar and the staff strangely gawping on at the glass.If you're looking for some pride around Paddington, I recommend you look elsewhere.",
