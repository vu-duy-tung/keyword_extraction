Fab kids menu, no shortage of high chairs, fast service - lovely staff. It's a pleasure for all of us to eat. I hate going to kid friendly restaurants and having to eat fast food myself - the food at Wagamamas is as always, healthy, excellent and within budget. A highlight of any visit to the South Bank",

Situated on the south bank, in the Royal Festival Hall complex, this is an ideal place to go for food before heading into the National Theatre, or into the West End. It does get very busy with the pre-theatre crowd, so be prepared to queue if you go in the early evening. Despite this, the staff are always pleasant and friendly, service is efficient, food is very good. An excellent way to start an evening out in London.",

Nevertheless the cheap food and excellent location more than makes up for this gripe, as long as you dont have to queue too long!",

I'm probably being a bit generous with the fourth star but I tend to go that way rather than being too harsh.What I liked about Wagamama:The food IS tasty. Fresh soups, noodles, etc. I really enjoyed my meal. And the desserts were very good actually....maybe even REALLY good. Also, they have long family style dining tables, which I always really like because it's nice to feel like you're dining as one big group and every now and then you meet new people.Here's what I didn't like about Wagamama:We had to wait a long time for a table. I can get over that though- it's usually an indication that the restaurant isn't half bad. But what really did bother me is that they didn't serve us all at the same time, just randomly brought bit by bit. My soup took about 10 minutes longer after everyone else in the group had been served, so I was a little bit ticked off about that, but mostly because I was ravenous and had to sit there watching all of my friends dive in and \"oooh, mmmm, yummmm!\" while I fiddled with my chopsticks. Once I was fed, I was much happier.If they could just serve everyone at the same time, I'd be much more likely to return...",

    "text": "We visited Wagas last night and as ever, were pretty impressed. I'd met my partner early to have a quick bite to eat before headin' off to the NT for a play. We met at 7pm and had planned to eat at Ping Pong, however PP was packed and they were turning people away and saying no tables for an hour. Southbank is buzzing now with restaurants and bars so we didn't think it'd be a problem getting a table elsewhere. Unfortunately Soutbank on a Tues night (even in hard hit times!) at 7pm is BUUUSSSY! We ventured into the NT to have a look at their in-house restaurants, but after taking a look at the Pizza & Pasta canteen (food looked like it had been on hot plates all day - not good!), The Mezzanine restaurant (pristine white table cloths - fine dining; not good for a quick, informal dinner!) we decided to play it safe and head to Wagamama. Wagas never fails to disspoint (and I've been to many right across London!). There was a cue out of the door, but we were given a menu and told we'd be seated in less than 15mins, which we were and ready to order! Our order was taken quickly and within minutes I had my raw juice, glass of water and yaki udon in front of me and was diggin' in - now that's what I like about Japanese canteen style restaurants - quick, efficient, fresh, hot tasty food and all served by friendly, quick staff - perfect pre-theatre restaurant!",

Perfect dinner spot before watching a production at The National that is only a couple of steps away or simply for enjoying a pleasant night by the Thames; everything about this joint is phenomenal - the atmosphere, the crowd and the staff; who admittedly, adore me! To top it all off - you don't have to worry about running a mile along the Embankment to work the fat off! Wagamamas' entire ethos revolves around the concept of healthy food that is phenomenal to taste [yes, I said it! Didn't think you'd be hearing of such a combination, did ya?!] It's true. Don't believe me? Check it out for yourself and become a Wagamama convert like the rest of us...it's not just food, it's a religion!!",

And in the summer, just sitting out here with friends on the big benches and scoffing loads of Wagamama goodness.Wagamama's food is just nice and I know it is a chain, but I can't help feeling like the meal has been cooked for me personally. I think it might be because you can see all the cooks at works with their woks. I used to always go for Chicken Cha Han, but now I tend to have some of the spicier curries or crispy noodle dishes. You can't really go wrong. Also, the gyoza dumplings are a must as a starter, dipped in spicy sauces. You get free green tea aswell. Also, sorry to go on, the apple and kiwi fresh juice is sublime, and the watermelon when in seasn. For pudding, the ginger cheesecake can finish you off, seriously!!So yes, wagamamas will always please, and this particular one is a delight.",

It's definitely a new twist to the low-key Japanese cafe/ramen bar type of places. The menu itself covers everything from ramen, yakisoba, cha han rice dishes, and curry. The amai udon here is my favorite yaki udon I've ever had. It was packed with flavor and the tofu and shrimp made it a nice and hearty dish.This location has a large dining hall feel to it. The atmosphere is fun and modern, and the benches give it a very casual and communal touch.I don't know how Wagamama does it, but they're able to give fresh flavors to traditional dishes without veering too far from the original. It's a risk to mess with comfort food, but Wagamama does it well. Great quality, amazing flavors, and good variety. Man, I miss this place.",

Well, it just never really struck me as somewhere I wanted to go. And does it now? I'm not sure. The chicken katsu curry I had was fine, the chicken was yum actually, but the curry cause was pretty rubbish and I like my curry to have something in the sauce - veg or onion or something. It's was just a bit gloopy. But it was yum and i was starving after accidentally getting drunk in the Royal Festival Hall in the middle of the afternoon. The dumplings on the other hand, were fantastic. Really amazing. I've been inspired to learn how to make dumplings coz they're yummy. The staff were lovely. Very attentive, but a bit forgetful. It was packed in here so i'm not surprised. Dinner for two, twenty quid and twenty minutes later and we were back out in the cold feeling full up and a little more sober. I'm not sure I'll make Wagamama's a regular haunt, but it might be handy to remember next time I'm drunk in the afternoon.",

With so many places to choose from in this area, we ended up at Wagamama's as the queue for tables at peak time was one of the shortest due to the quick customer turnaround. We only had to wait for 10 minutes at 8.15pm, which was fantastic as we were absolutely ravenous. Dinner costs around \u00a310 per head.

I ordered the ramen soup with pork. I was pleasantly surprised with the presentation of the food, with a lovely boiled egg, very nice noodles, fresh greens and a good portion of pork slices laid on top of the noodles. I like the wooden ladle spoon. It's great for slurping soup and for adding bits of ingredients in the spoon. The broth had a bit of nutty taste, rich and delicious.The green tea is free I believe, which is an added bonus, free wi-fi which is helpful for out of towners like me, and excellent customer service. I can't believe people call me \"Darling\" here, it's like being in the South in the US, which makes the place friendly and inviting. The atmosphere is lively, long benches and tables make the restaurant feel communal. The price of the meal is reasonable. I'm quite satisfied.",

Loud, boisterous and crowded on a regular week night. After been seated, we scanned the room in search of dishes that might pose of interest to us. We ended up ordering what seemed like popular dishes-the chicken curry katsu over rice and yasai chilli-men. Hmmm, not the worst that I have had. They were all right. A bit on the saltier side with a little too much on the sauce to noodles/rice ratio but portions were large and I was hungry. Prices were reasonable if I didn't have to convert them from dollars to pounds. Service was quick and efficient. Packed with carbs and starches, we went in and out in a jiffy.

(which would normally render it 2*)Since I am still diseased, I had a bowl of the wagamama ramen this evening. \u00a0You see, Chinese people believe in not eating fried food when they are sick because it makes it worse. \u00a0So amongst fried noodles and curries and spicy food, I could really only choose between salad (hello? what summer are we talking about here? and salad is equally bad when you are sick) or a nice warming bowl of ramen.Ramen it is then. \u00a0The broth was actually not bad, a little msg-y but quite tasty. \u00a0The noodles unfortunately was a bit overcooked and has lost it's bite. \u00a0Toppings consist of fresh watercress (yum), wakame (too little), pickley something (I love pickle anything, apart from onion!), fish (slightly over cooked), fish cake (yummy), fried tofu (ok) and grilled chicken (sliced too thick). \u00a0Overall, quite satisfying. \u00a0I guess it's because I come from the soupy-noodle-side-of-the-world and therefore am pretty picky about ramen...Unending glasses of free water and cups of free tea was much appreciated by my sore throat.One thing though, because it is on the south bank strip, it gets mega busy at about 6:30 when everyone comes for a quick bite pre~ whatever they are seeing... and with a \"you are not allowed to move inside when it rains\" policy, it gets pretty hectic and noisy inside the inside part of the restaurant especially with unpredictable english summer weather.",

There's better customer service, although it's never bad, but if you want quick, tasty food without having to book this place is a great choice.We were seated quickly and when we had to wait for a friend, we didn't feel rushed. Two of us both couldn't decide whether to go for the good old chicken Katsu curry or go for the beef donburi so we ordered both between us and the waitress have us each an extra plate. I do love katsu and it was definitely my favourite dish. I would have liked a little more sauce as it's so tasty and because there was so much rice. The beef donburi was delicious but again, there was too much rice. I had to add a fair bit of soy sauce so the rice wasn't so dry. The beef was tender and I did enjoy it.My other friend had tuna steak to have a slightly healthier option. It was a decent size piece of fish and she was impressed with it.Overall, very tasty dishes with big portions, although too much rice.Still a safe bet every time for a decent and quick meal.",

    "text": "PRO: Warm, dry place to hide from the rain; like the green teaCON: Noisy, the food, little bit of honesty about the food, chef. BOTTOM LINE: If you want Asian food, go to Chinatown; don't waste your money here. As a Chinese and frequent visitor to Japan, definitely am already wary of any \"Asian fusion\" items, but came here for a quick snack and to escape the rain. The service was fine; appreciate the free green tea. We just had a few snacks, but specifically the steamed pork gyoza. About 5 quid for 4 pieces of gyoza (Japanese version of Chinese potstickers) wasn't a horrible price, but mind you, we ordered STEAMED gyoza. What comes out? Pan-fried gyoza...clearly pan-fried. We asked the waitress why it wasn't steamed; she brought it to the chef and said, \"oh, they are steamed, but the chef fried it on one side so it would taste better.\" O...em...gee...were they actually trying to educate CHINESE people about how to eat dumplings and gyoza? Really...?!? Oh, and may I add, I MAKE potstickers and gyoza from scratch, including the wrappers. Would've felt a little better if she simply admitted that the chef couldn't be bothered to give us what we ordered. Whatever...the gyoza was sub-par; very bland, and not even crispy if you were going for pan-fried. Let that be a lesson to us for trying a bastardized version of asian food. If you want real potstickers or authentic dumplings, go to Chinatown. Four Seasons and Old Town 97 do not disappoint. Seriously, don't waste your money on subpar food and uncomfortable seats (yes, realize that is their business model). You can at least go to the worst restaurant in Chinatown and get better food there.",

    "text": "It was a Thursday evening and I went there looking for somewhere to eat with my wife. We were strolling by the river and spotted Wagamama. I thought to myself, 'it'll be a good experience like always'. I've had Wagamama before a few times and its always been a great experience. Its just this branch that didn't satisfy us the same way. We queued up to be seated. The waitress gave us a table next to the dish collector. The other staff didn't know that table existed. It didn't appear on their system. We ordered food and the waiter was quite rude when I asked him again what this particular dish was. There seemed to be an ongoing issue amongst the waiters and staff. They were all complaining to each other loudly infront of every one about how poor the management is. We got our food and it came separately. My wife got her food 10 minutes after me. I didn't quite understand that. During the meal apart from the ongoing complaining of waiters, the plates were being thrown in the dish collector next to us. It was a horribly loud experience! They also didn't know about our table because it didn't show on their system so they were taking our food to other tables. In the end I asked for the bill and it took them 15 minutes to bring the bill. Then I asked for the card machine and that took them another 15 minutes to bring. Only reason for my 3 stars is the food. The quality of the food is always great! The service was very poor! I don't think I'll ever go to that branch again.",

It advertises \"noodles in a miso, ginger and chicken soup topped with barbecued pork, a tea-stained egg, pea shoots, and wakame. served with a korean barbecue sauce and garnished with menma and spring onions.\" I did not taste anything korean about it and the broth was very boring. Luckily there was chili oil on the table. I did enjoy the pork, egg, menma, and pea shoots. The noodles were all right. My parents enjoyed their dishes and this was actually their second time eating at a Wagamama in during their week in London. It seems pretty expensive for what you get.

Needless to say, this experience was equally lackluster.We arrived around 6:30pm on a Monday to a very crowded restaurant. This is obviously not anything against them as this is the way a place in Southbank should be at this time. The girl who served us was ok although she seemed like she really wanted to rush us out. My friend and I hadn't seen each other for a while so we weren't immediately ready to order (she wanted to take our order as soon as we sat down...sorry, I'm not a regular and haven't memorized the menu?)I ordered pad thai and it was disappointing. No real flavor jumped out at me, it was just a bunch of noodles with some peanuts, prawns, and maybe some chicken (I can't even remember!). We didn't order anything else and the dish was so unremarkable that I can't really comment much further! For the price, I'd rather go somewhere else.I will say their one redeeming quality is the free green tea but, to be fair, this is quite watered down and it tough to flag someone down to get more tea or water.I'll easily wait a few more years (or more, if I can!) before attempting another Wagamama...",

My daughter got chicken ramen and was very happy with it. She said the broth had amazing flavor. The husband got curry chicken one of his favorite dishes. He kept saying \"MMM\", \"MMM\".

Plenty of open seating so we got a booth by the window with great views outside. They also have outdoor seating and at this time of year many are selecting that option. Service was fast and UK friendly. At first they delivered the wrong entree to our table. The spicy calamari appetizer was plentiful and quite good. My son had yaki soba and I had Wagamama Ramen. Both dishes were very good. The fried noodles are a little greasy, but that's to be expected. The food was standard Wagamama, and I've eaten at locations that had much better service. Overall gets the job done and definitely worth a recommendation.",

It may be a chain restaurant, but that doesn't take away from the quality. These guys know their ramen and Asian specialties. You can expect to find everything from donburi to gyoza on the menu, including some healthy fresh-pressed juices and not-so-healthy booze, as well. I usually make suggestions for the restaurants I visit, but honestly, I say go with whatever you're feeling. If you want something light, try their smaller and starter dishes like the gyoza and edema me. Want a heartier meal? Definitely try their ramen, which comes in several different varieties, from duck to vegetarian. If you want something a bit different, I recommend the Shiitake Donburi, which is a huge bowl packed with goodness and perfect for vegetarians, especially if you like Shiitake mushrooms. Careful, though, it's super spicy. It's certainly not the quietest restaurant you'll dine at, nor the cheapest, but the taste and quality are definitely worth it.",

There's seating both inside and outside, be prepared to sit next to strangers as the outside seats are all very close together. It didn't really bother me, I was too concentrated on shoveling the yummy food into my mouth. I had the roast duck Donburi which was AMAZING and my husband had the Wagamama ramen and he loved it. They have a nice selection of Sakes and beers to wash your food down with and the prices are all very reasonable. Service is fast and good, no complaints.Worth checking out.",

The only reason this is a 3 and not a 4 is because what I ordered looked so appealing in the menu imagery, though the end product was bland and almost entirely lacking in flavor. I ordered the Chili Sirloin ramen and it arrived as a steaming bowl with a decent amount of onions and veggies, however the sirloin was cut into four or five thick and unfortunately ultra-chewy pieces that you really had to work. Disappointed because as I looked around, other diners orders looked so much more appealing. I want to try them again and this time I know what I;m ordering! Definitely going back for another go.",

While the menu seem to have an eastern influence, the food is really targeted at tourist that are not experienced in Asian foods. For example, the big ladle that looks orient, but is not used in any Japanese restaurant for single servings. And then the food isnt seasoned like any recipe out side of instant ramen. While I have nothing against toning the original recipe down to be more compatible with a large audience, the thought that people will walk away talking about their experience here as Asian makes me a little sad.",

    "text": "Having heard a lot of good things about wagamama's, I definitely had high hopes for this chain Japanese/Asian restaurant and in some ways it met my expectations and in others it didn't. Starting with the good - the portions are huge with reasonable prices (a plus given that London prices are up there in general) and the waiters are really good at trying to get you in as quickly as possible so that your starving belly doesn't implode. The katsu curry is what everyone seems to get but it wasn't for me and I was a bit disappointed. The curry flavor is just a bit off - not exactly Japanese flavored/style - but the katsu was fine. My brown rice (nice that they have the option of white or brown) was actually not fully cooked so they were really good/quick about giving me a new plate because of that. The dish I WOULD recommend in place of the katsu curry is the grilled duck donburi (rice bowl). This is a bit more pricey (12-13 pounds) but so delicious and the flavor is on point. Also tried their korean bbq beef steamed bun (2 for about 6 pounds so a little bit more pricey but steamed buns in general are always more expensive because of their tapas nature) which was good but if you're going for bang for your buck, I'd say go for the rice bowls or noodles.",

I would recommend most of their noodles and rice dishes, but may be not the coconut based ones...have had much better.

You can come here and get a good fusion type Asian meal. I got the curry pork cutlet dish, which was tasty, crunchy, and had a good amount of heat.There's also a really impressive selection of smoothie, or extracted drinks.

It's not surprising given its locale so keep that in mind and remember it's communal tables so don't try to fly while you eat :)I treat Wagamama as an in and out experience. Order your food, scoff, pay and leave. The seating isn't comfortable and since this one is so crowded all the time, it's probably not a good idea to stay for no reason after you're done eating. Eating here can be very economical if you steer clear of alcohol and dessert. Chicken katsu is a filling and cheap option, free green tea makes it a complete meal. I don't feel the ramen dishes are as filling but hey, if that's your thing than knock yourself out. Kare lomen is where I think it's at but the Wagamama ramen is pretty decent. Seafood hete is always nice and fresh. Sides and desserts are pricey so I would stay away if you're hoping to get a meal for under a tenner per head. Wagamama's a safe bet. I will never claim that it's particularly good food but given that it's quick and available just about everywhere in London, it's one of the places I've come to embrace as a sanctuary for the cold, weary and hungry.",
