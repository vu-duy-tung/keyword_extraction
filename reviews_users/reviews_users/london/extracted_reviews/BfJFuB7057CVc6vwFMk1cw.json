I have had the chance of experiencing Nobu in London, Tokyo and Los Angeles (Matsuhisa). They are both excellent and have the same menu. My favorite by far is the LA one as the croud is far less \"wannabe\" than the London Met Hotel one. Nobu Matsuhisa is a really creative chef and the must tries in my eyes are: black cod with miso, the new style sashimi, Sashimi Salad with Matsuhisa Dressing, Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno, Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Spicy Sauce, any tempura (avocado and sweet potato are my favorites), Beef Toban Yaki... and of course the very very good sake! One of my favorite restaurants in the world.",

Heard so many good words about it , that had to try it myself- and i wasn't disappointed! its superb, in any aspect -the location, the service, the atmosphere, the diners, and of course \u00a0the food! The flavours, the variety, the authentic scents and spices , made me feel as if I'm at the heart Tokyo, in one of the finest restaurants there. Magnificent and very rewarding dining experience \u00a0the only thing that could have topped it up was seeing Robert de Niro in the flesh",

The fish here is supplied by Atari- Ya in Bond street, which has some of the cheapest sushi/sashimi to be had in London, so here they decide to pretty much destroy the natural flavour of the raw fish by adding all sorts of crazy sauces... (easy way to cover up if the fish isnt the freshest)\"Chocolate Bento Box\" is basically the most widely available american dessert-chocolate lava cake. Its put into a bento box with green tea ice cream... pretty much tastes like every other lava cake out there.Save your money and go somewhere else.... ANYWHERE else. You wont see any japanese go anywhere near Nobu, with good reason.",

    "text": "I've never been much of a 'fine diner'. My long-term boyfriend is an ex-chef for Gordon Ramsay so often I get Michelin-star food in the comfort of my own home which is a lovely bonus! However, for my 21st birthday my family took us to Nobu - a restaurant I have lusted after (and hinted to my boyfriend about!) for many years. The atmosphere is lively and fairly casual which wasn't what I was expecting but it made the whole experience much more enjoyable as we were all chatting and laughing without any evil glares from the richer patrons. The food, needless to say, was absolutely divine - my favourite dishes which I recommend to EVERYONE are: Yellowtail Tuna Tataki with jalapenos, beef sashimi, wagyu beef, shrimp tempura, black code with miso and Choclate Bento Box to finish. Don't be swayed by anything else on the lengthy dessert menu - I had to send back to Mexican Chocolate Cake as I had massive food envy after seeing my mother and sisters Bento boxes! The food comes all at once and they make it really easy to share dishes (we had plates passing around all 5 of us all evening long) and it's better that way as you get to taste a little bit of everything. Impeccable service, lovely cocktails, great ambience - if I was a millionaire I'd dine here everyday!",

The famous black cod with miso is famous for a reason - it's really good. Soft, light, flaky cod smothered in salty, earthy miso paste satisfies that part of you that can never get full from eating raw fish. Another stand out dish is the seared kobe steak, seared rare, with some delicious alcohol-based sauce. The fat from the steak is for sure an artery clogger, but it almost melts in your mouth. Very, very tasty.The decor leaves something to be desired - it's rather plain, but then almost all Nobu restaurants are rather plain. It's perhaps a nod to the zen-like simplicity of Japanese decor, and almost a reminder to focus on your food.",

I will say that the food and drinks were really nice. The bar serves a surprisingly subtle bloody Mary with wasabi and tankatsu sauce. I'll definitely be making this one at home, so thanks for the inspiration! Sadly I couldn't justify spending \u00a332 for their signature black cod with miso. Instead I had a Latin spiced ribeye over rice, which was a delightfully spicy riff on the Japanese meat over rice dishes like katsudon and unagidon. On the more traditional end, my lady had the prixe-fixe sushi lunch, which featured only the highest quality designer fish (like bluefin and wild salmon). The hand rolled maki (the lady called them Japanese tacos) were particularly delicious. The low point for me was cultural... while the excellent service made me feel like I was getting my money's worth, it's make me wiggle when all the servers yell \"irashaimase\" when customers walk in and there's not a Japanese soul in sight.",

    "text": "I've been to Nobu in NYC and Vegas and decided on this location, which my wife told me was \"less of a scene\" than the other London location. I love the food here. Fresh, light, creative and spicy. We started with some sushi, which is always excellent here. We had spicy tuna and a California roll. It was as good as sushi can be in my book. We then chose a selection of small plates as we always do, instead of going with the larger entree portion. Grilled Asparagus with spicy salsa was an exciting opener. The always delectable rock shrimp in vinegary Ponzu sauce followed and reinforced its claim as the best selection at Nobu. Squid \"pasta\" with asparagus and shitake mushrooms in an oyster sauce has become another dependable selection that we enjoyed. Our last small dish was Peruvian Spicy Chicken skewers, which brought the heat. The staff was helpful with our wine selection and we went with a nice fruity white that balanced the heat of our dishes nicely. They also kept the wine flow perfectly measured with our meal. and it lasted for our entire dinner. We finished with the Fuji apple, which we enjoyed very much. Always the scene, this Nobu location did not disappoint either. There were certainly a few very large tables of glitterati and scenesters and I have never seen dresses and skirts like that outside of Vegas. However, my wife and I were able to have a delicious meal and had no problem hearing each other or being too crowded. The one thing I don't get is what is up with the bar. We arrived on time for our reservation and although the restaurant had just opened and was empty, we were shuffled off to their bar/lounge. I'm here for dinner and am going to put away at least one bottle of wine easy. I guess if cocktails are your thing this probably wouldn't bother you, but I looked at it as a delaying annoyance of padding the bill with overpriced drinks. My wife and I always get a kick out of places that are part club and part restaurant. As the saying goes \"a jack of all trades is a master of none.\" That said, I was here to eat and it lived up to every great memory I have had of dining at Nobu. Excellent food and impeccable service. Enjoy.",

Since it wasn't busy when we went service was good, prompt, & a bit over staffed.

They offered 2 Tasting Menus: One traditional and another contemporary.I am glad that each of us had the different one and shared everything.Every dish was FANTASTIC: Well-prepared and gratifying.What was missing was a bit of creativity, which compensated REALLY WELL with traditional side of Japanese cuisine. The service and ambience were medium scale restaurant level:Limited-attentiveness, extremely casual & loud crowds with Nordstrom department-food-court decor. Since I enjoyed the Tasting Menu dishes, I do not mind trying their NY and Tokyo locations.",

It brings japanese fusion and cocktails to a new level that make me feel that other food just isn't worth eating if it isn't as great as the level that Nobu takes cuisine to. I had a japanese mojito as recommended by the waitress, it was a mojito with a hint of vanilla, which turned out to be an absolute gold mine. My friends who I went with has been to every location of Nobu's now and did all of the ordering, so I couldn't tell you exactly which dishes to order, however I doubt that you could go wrong. I recommend the flash fried shrimp and any of the fish dishes. It is rather expensive, but I would dare to say worth the money if your wallet is big enough.",

    "text": "It's only taken me 13 years to get around to eating at this eponymous eatery. Not knowing the lay of the land, while strolling in from the rain it's hard not to think when you check in your coat on the ground floor, whether that cloakroom was 'the place' that Boris Becker had his 'moment of madness'. But stroll up the stairwell and you're greeted by (for the most part) uber efficient front of house staff in a light and airy dining room with large windows that provide a panoramic view of Park Lane. Not my favourite part of town, and certainly not as convenient location wise for me, per se.I'm gonna say it, but wasn't keen on the somewhat unnecessarily loud 'nameste' style greeting that is chanted to you by staff when you enter the actual dining area. Because ultimately that means you have to hear it many more times after you're seated! We sat at a window banquette and like Berkeley Street, the tables are SMALL! Food wise for me the tempura while expensive remains a must (a perfect case in point that quality over quantity wins the day). And my spicy garlic vegetable Donburi was extremely delicious and generous (I almost finished it all). Although you can't help but think, despite the Michelin star, at the end of the day, my meal format at a linear level was akin to an (admittedly) upscale Wagamama Yasai Cha Han, right down to the sides of Miso soup and plate of pickles (or maybe Waga's is copying Nobu?) My friend's Bento Box though was in a class of its own, both in presentation and the vast array of foods on offer including the signature black cod. She also ordered her favourite drink, a watermelon Martini (which you won't find in a Wagas!), which she swears by. I opted for a more pedestrian Diet Coke and tap water, because let's be honest the Fijian mineral water they serve is a rip off and pure marketing hype. The carbon footprint must be horrendous.The dining room was busy, but I reckon you could have walked in without a reservation. Times are hard, it seems, even for Nobu. I'd be tempted to go there for a (special) dinner date, but for lunch I'd probably stick to Berkeley Street.",

It's certainly not cheap - \u00a380 for the 'set meal' (before the pricey drinks), but they can charge this because they make the food like pieces of artwork.Whilst I'd prefer to give the restaurant 90% rather than 100% (the food was mainly fantastic, but a couple of dishes were only 'really good'), giving an 80% would seem unfair. This is clearly a place for foodies with a sense of style. I won't be back every week, or even every couple of months, but I will plan another visit at some point. It's a place for special occasions.Service was good - polite and friendly. I know some have said the service is mediocre or poor, but we were very happy with the attention we received. The ambience was classy, but not romantic. There was a bit of a buzz, a bit of a vibe, and it felt good to be sitting by a window looking out towards Hyde Park. I bet it would be even better on a summer evening at dusk. Overall, I've given a 5 out of 5, as it's the best dining experience I've had in a long time. I'd highly recommend for those looking for something a bit special.",

Sushi ranged from good to nearly great, plus a memorable salmon skin salad (though slightly too salty). Sakatinis were reliable and we had a decent onigoroshi sake which was good and not badly priced. Overall, a good place to eat, but be prepared to pay over the odds (just make a reservation for the New York branch instead - better value) and the ambience is somewhat hotel restaurant like. In summary, Nobu London epitomizes London - you get great stuff (food, service etc.) if you are prepared to pay, and pay. All your staff will be foreign (eastern Europe), well dressed and pleasant. I hope they get some of the massive tip revenues the place generates.",

I'd been looking forward to going to visiting you for so long. \u00a0Honestly, if I had gone here a few years ago when good food in London was hard to fine, I would have left this dinner with a full stomach and huge smile on my face despite the bill. My 3 star rating here isn't' because the food is bad - because let's be honest, great sushi isn't easy to find in London, but because the value just simple isn't there. \u00a0I wish I could say I wasn't disappointed but we left Nobu full on tempura, delicious sushi, dessert, cocktails, saki and a 200 quid bill and I couldn't help thinking of all the other places we could have gone and left just as satisfied for half the price. \u00a0We decided to go to Old Park Lane as it was easier to get a last minute reservation (so no, not Berkley Square!). \u00a0Though Nobu is indeed right next to the Park, the view isn't what you would want or expect given the status of the restaurant and I was disappointed during a visit to the ladies' room to see how old and not-charming the walk down the stars was. These may seem like petty things to point out, but when you're paying top notch for dinner (and with comparable places now in London) this just didn't do it for me.Sorry, Nobu.

    "text": "An overall solid performance, with just 2 complaints to make.For lunch with I had a single piece of o-toro tuna sushi, the new style salmon sashimi, and a beef katsu donburi. For all this and a glass of iced green tea I payed 60 pounds.The o-toro sushi was fantastic. The quality of the fish was exquisite, and the rice was just perfect, bringing such an amazing amount of flavour which, instead of masking the flavour of the tuna, enhanced it. There was no need to add any wasabi in my opinion as the right amount was already added by the chef. Even the ginger and fresh wasabi which accompanied the sushi was of very high quality. 10/10Nobu's new style sashimi is, simply put, Japanese style carpaccio. The sashimi is arranged on a plate with shaved ginger, sesame seeds, and finely chopped scallions. It's then drizzled with soy sauce, and I believe sesame oil and some yuzu or lemon juice, which gives it a sour/tart flavour. Heated olive oil is also drizzled over the sashimi to cook it slightly, altering it's texture and flavour slightly. I thought this dish was great, except the dish was a bit too sour, overpowering the other flavours and unbalancing the dish, making it hard to discern the taste of the fish, or even the other components of the dish. A little less acidity would go a long way. 7/10The main course course was the beef katsu donburi, which is a thin breaded beef steak about an inch thick, fried first in oil, the finished in a separate pan with a broth mixture where a beaten egg mixture is added towards the end of cooking such that it almost wraps around the beef. It's served over a bed of rice. It was delicious. The beef and the egg mixture had taken on the taste of the savoury, slightly sweet flavour of the broth, complementing it beautifully with it's own. The rice was also perfectly cooked and was lightly coated in the thick broth as well. Unfortunately the beef was overcooked to 'well done', which was a shame as it dried out the beef. It was explained to me before that they're unable to cook it medium-rare as it's quite thin, however I was expecting it medium or medium-well at most, rather than the well-done and dry state that it came. Although the flavours were fantastic and the rest of the dish was damn near perfect, the main component of the dish being dry and overcooked greatly detracted from the dish. 7/10.Although the raw ingredients used here, especially in the sushi/sashimi dishes, are of an extremely high quality, the execution of the dishes was a let down. New style sashimi is an interesting idea, but the dish was too tart to be something truly memorable, and the overcooking of the beef in an otherwise wonderful donburi is almost criminal. A good meal, but not great, which is what Nobu should be.",

I was here for dinner on a Monday night and did not see a salary-man in sight.Do not get me wrong, there was nothing wrong with the food. There was nothing great about the food either. \u00a0When you're hawking a 100 pound omakase, I expect to be impressed. I think Nobu was one of the trendsetters for what we now see as the typical western Japanese restaurant. That's exactly how it felt. Like every Japanese restaurant from the 90's. \u00a0I love gindara miso to death, but the Nobu version was not any better than the 100 imitation restaurants. I would not return unless I absolutely had to. There are other better overpriced Japanese restaurants.",

The ambiance might be stuck up and unfriendly, the staff is definitely pushing to make you order as much as humanly possible, the decor is not jaw dropping, I will give you that. But the FOOD is amazing, and I can generalize on the subject not only because I have been there a lot of times, but because the last time we went, in 5, we were a little drunk and very late, so we had to just go ahead and order before the kitchen would close, and so we ORDERED. EVERYTHING. TWO of everything. Our check was over 1200 gbp for five people, so you can imagine the sheer amount of comida. ALL good. I am strict and relatively harsh on my reviews, but haters, don't be hatin on NOBU! it's stuck up, pricey and pushy, but you are guaranteed a divine meal.",

They managed to bring extraordinary flavor and taste to octopus, a difficult task. \u00a0Every dish was well prepared and elegantly presented. I greatly enjoyed the caviar infused martini but then again I rarely meet a crisp, cold and dry martini I don't like. ( we can talk about dirty martinis later). Here's where I do find fault: while the service was excellent - despite the fact that the place was very busy - management has devised a clever way to add $10 to the bill. They initially offer water and immediately open and provide bottled water. Add that to the bill and the \"optional\" 15 percent tip and VAT, well you take my point, a fairly substantial bill (worth it) becomes one $13 plus dollars higher. So, if you eat here, and you should, have an extra martini and say: tap water please. You can always drink water at the hotel or at home. You will survive and be happier in the long run. That said, back home soon to barbecue and bourbon but I do sound fancier when I'm in London.",

    "text": "Their raw food's excellent, the rest is only so-so.Came here for lunch on a Sunday and the first things that struck me was the number of children under the age of 10. They ordered the \u00a342 miso black cod without thinking twice and knew the menu by heart. Unreal.The decor's quite minimal with a few japanese flower arrangements on the larger tables and while not unpleasant, having heard so much about this place I thought it'd be grander. Similarly, service could've been better. Given the number of wait staff walking around, nothing much seemed to be happening. They check all the boxes in terms of refilling your glass, taking your order, but something's still lacking--personality. It all seemed quite mechanical, like you'd expect at a chain (which I guess this is).It took quite a while for the food to arrive but the sushi was definitely worth the wait. Very fresh, great selection. The negi toro cut roll was superb and the seaweed was crispy. The scallop sushi was sweet and smooth and they were huge! The mackerel sushi was also really good--oily with some bite. You get two thin slices on the rice instead of one thick slice, which is much more enjoyable texture-wise. We also ordered the snow crab in creamy spicy sauce, which looked a lot like a cheesy pasta bake. On its own the crab was so tasty but there was too much sauce which totally masked the flavour of the crab! :(( The rock shrimp tempura with ponzu sauce were even more disappointing. Although the serving was huge and you could tell the prawns were fresh, you could taste and feel the oil. The ponzu sauce made them so soggy that the batter would peel off as your chopsticks touched it. And you could hardly taste the sauce! When you could, it was delicious, but that rarely happened. I feel like it's the sort of dish that you'd order to keep ravenous teenage boys full on a 'budget'.I probably wouldn't be coming back. The quality of their sushi's top tier but at that price, you can get equally fresh sushi elsewhere in London. No reason to come to this particular restaurant other than to say you've dined at Nobu.",

Tuna tartare with special peach - The tuna was fresh, but perhaps the best part was the peach!2. Tuna salad with shrimp - The dressing was a bit strong and hid the flavour of the tuna, and the shrimp looked and tasty somewhat bland.3. Black cod miso - Everybody seems to rave about this as the *BEST* thing ever, and whilst it's well done, I just don't understand the hype. \u00a0Many standard Chinese restaurants can steam / grill all kinds of fishes that are just as good. \u00a0A nice touch was the tasty rod of white ginger.4. Scottish beef tataki - As per its name, the beef was nicely seared on the outside and placed on a sizzling plate with fresh asparagus and enoki / shitake mushrooms. \u00a0The sauce was much too salty for me, but it was interesting to eat different slices of beef at various levels of 'well-doneness\".5. Sushi platter - Standard sushi with nice rolls made from soft shell crab and asparagus.6. Miso soup - Does this really count as a course?7. Cappuccino icecream - You can't really go wrong with this!-As a side note, I tried Nobu Miami a few years ago and it was good to see my favourite dish - yellowtail with jalapeno - still on the menu. I wished I had the appetite to order it again!Service:-Staff were friendly, if not a bit detached, and the dishes were served at a good pace. \u00a0No complaints.",

    "text": "Excellent food, as you'd come to expect from any Nobu establishment. All the usual favorites are here, including new-style sashimi, crispy rice with sushi, miso black cod, and creamy spicy shrimp. Although not very authentic, all our dishes were fresh and delicious, and presented excellently as well. Service is decently friendly, if a bit unorganized at times (probably due to the fact that you don't have a dedicated server) - we asked to keep a menu for perusing main courses after ordering some appetizers, only to have it whisked away by a passing waiter. Waters were refilled frequently, and new cups of green teas were brought out as soon as the previous ones were finished. Decor leans towards the modern; lots of wood and decent lighting. I do wish they would eliminate the irasshaimase that all the staff shout out at arriving guests - it gets annoying pretty quick, and they all botch the pronunciation anyways.",

    "text": "Before reviewing Nobu, I should note that I have been to Japan and eaten fresh sushi there.That being said, Nobu is likely the best sushi you can have in London. Our party arrived on time and we were promptly seated. The staff checked our coats and took us to our table. The locale is very trendy with some great lighting centered just above the table. Great for taking photos of your food! Also people watching as you'll see all walks of life inside.I expected the sushi to be the highlight of my dining experience here but instead it was the appetizers, notably the sushi tacos, the baby tiger shrimp tempura, and best of all--the roasted padron peppers. Each order of sushi tacos brings just one delightful little boat with some salted sushi and tasty salsa sauce to go with it. The taco was great with a nice buttery flavor. The baby tiger shrimp tempura stole the show. They were just perfectly fried with a non-excessive helping of creamy spicy sauce. And you'll think I'm crazy for saying this but the shrimp was laid out on the freshest bed of arugula (or rocket, for the Brits) that I've ever had. So fresh that my friend and I finished up all the tasty greens after we finished the shrimp.I was surprised to see the padron peppers on the menu instead of shiso (I suspect they may be the same). These playful peppers are known for their random distribution of spicy. Most of the peppers are not, but occasionally you'll get a really hot one and you won't figure out until you take a bite. These were roasted to perfection and quickly devoured by the members of our party. If these are on the menu (I believe they were a special that night) I suggest you try them. Their taste is pepper-y but distinctly different. More savory than sweet and rarely found in restaurants.The drinks menu is nice an extensive with some traditional offerings plus a lot of nice Japan-inspired drinks involving sake, plum wine, lychee liquor, and shiso pepper leaves. I was between a bourbon based drink and the japanese margarita and ultimately went for the latter \u00a0which contained red chili infused sake in addition to your margarita fixings. There's a great number of non-alcoholic juice-based options if that is more your style. The lychee beverage was just sweet enough and definitely a nice alternative for those nights you really don't want to spike that alcohol level.Finally, the sushi. The sushi tacos had some of that lovely raw fish served at Nobu but were overpowered by the salsa and taco. The real show is with the sashimi. You order your individual piece and they'll bring them out in a grand serving plate. You get your choice of different tunas--all of which are fantastic and fresh. I had a lovely dining experience with the exception of a couple sashimis whose rice beds fell apart. These were dabbed on the underside with just the right amount of wasabi. Although if you like some more you'll have some of that as well at your table.Ultimately this was a positive experience albeit over priced. This is likely a combination of Nobu being a trendy London restaurant and the steep prices for decent fresh fish in an inland city. As mentioned before, the show stealers were really the tempura shrimp and the padron peppers rather than the raw fish. \u00a0At the end of the day, the reality is that I had a more satisfying sushi experience at a hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Tokyo than I did at the great Nobu in London. I loved the arugula and padron peppers, but is that really what you should take away from this experience? Just not worth the price tag.",

We ordered lovely cocktails too and the entire experience was very lovely. I like how it's an upscale restaurant but you could definitely dress up or down here.

I was excited to finally go. Then I went to the wrong Nobu. I went to the flagship store on Berkley Street only to realized that my deal was at a different location on Park Lane. When I finally arrived at the restaurant, I was disappointed, as it looked quite plain and we even only had those one time use chopsticks. I ignored it all, as I was anticipating a great meal. Then it turned out to be a very OK experience. The four course we had were sashimi starter, assortment of sushi, tempura and then chicken with Teriyaki Sauce. I was expecting a lot more from Nobu, or at least a little twist or something different. If these were the dishes I want to eat, I would have gone to a local Japanese restaurant. I felt it was totally pedestrian. I understand that usually restaurants don't tend to put their best dishes in set menu deals, but come one, maybe just one awesome dish to make me want to come back and try the regular menu. Now, I have totally no desire of returning.",

    "text": "\"Good evening and welcome to Nobu London...\" Yeah, right! I didn't feel welcome at all.At Nobu London you can reserve a table, but for a maximum of two hours. This is the new generation of fast food. Literally.\"Would you like some *something unintelligible*?\" Some what? \"Oh, you haven't been here before. Eh, what do you usually like to eat?\" My sister says that she likes spring rolls and tempura maki. \"Nice, something more?\" We actually have to ask if it's possible to wait for the last one (me, I came a few minutes late) before ordering, and maybe have a look at the menu.When I arrive they start filling up our glasses with water. That we pay for. You take one sip and they're all over you filling up your glass again. And again. And again. \"Do you want another one?\"So, food then. We decide to order a wide range of sushi, meat, green beans and spring rolls to share. After giving our order she suggests ordering a main meal for each of us as well, because it won't be enough. We have to convince her that we'll start with this, and then see.Ordering a couple of beers and a coke as well. Beer is thrown into the glass with no control, I've rarely seen that much foam. And they continue filling up all the time. Just to get rid of it. So we can order some more.And now the food starts arriving. First some sushi. At least the food isn't the worst I've ever tasted. That's something. Moving the last piece of sushi from the plate, and they're all over us again removing the plate. It happens again, and again. They even ask if they could take out those we haven't finished yet.We're kinda wondering if this is a comedy show with hidden cameras. At least not a restaurant where you have to pay \u00a33.50 for rice in an espresso cup, and where a dinner for three adults and a child, without starters or dessert, costs \u00a3160. Remember that we ordered little food. Yet we were all satisfied. We would like to have some dessert, though. But not here.Paying was an exciting process. Just by putting the credit card at the table we got the bill, and seconds later the payment machine. \"Insert your card here, please\". We had to persuade her to let us look at the bill first. No option whether you wanted to pay the service charge or not, even though the bill stated this opportunity.Before leaving for dessert at Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 I had to go to the toilet. Straight forward, to the right, in through some doors who made me wonder if I was heading toward a submarine or space ship. Then down some stairs and through a couple of corridors. Oh, there it is! If you're a man at least, women has a few more stairs to take.After doing what I had to, I went to wash my hands (of course). Oh, another Nobu-employee. Thanks for showing me how to turn on the water, I wouldn't find out myself. Yeah, I know how soap dispensers works as well, thanks dude. And even before I got the soap off my hands he stood there with the towel up in my face. If I want another one? Does it look like I would need another one. Don't think so. And then you want money? Here is a pound, hope you're happy!So... finding my way back is the next mission. I wasn't aware that I came here for a labyrinth adventure, but that's how it turned out. After taking some stairs, I try a door. Oh, hi dude. \"This is wrong way\" We take one more stair before trying again. Old flowers, meeting rooms and an elevator. Guess it's wrong again. After walking up and down the stairs trying some doors we found our way out of the labyrinth.Finally out of this place we're heading down the street for a dessert at Hard Rock Caf\u00e9. At least we're welcome and we can even sit as long as we want.Spare your time, money and irritation. You're not welcome at Nobu anyway.",

    "text": "Our Monday night experience at Nobu was MEH and only made it to A-OK thanks to attentive staff and management. The food alone would NOT have made it to A-OK. Going to Nobu for her birthday after the completion of The Championship (aka Wimbledon for folks that are not interested in tennis) is our friend's tradition. So we looked forward some treats. All three of us love sashimi, but for variety, we thought the seasonal tasting menu would be a good idea. Wrong! The tasting menu was MEH at best. I rarely had worse. And it is hard to get less value (\u00a3100 per person). The tapas size dishes were generally over-sauced. On the seafood starter plate had salmon, but - in my opinion - salmon doesn't belong on a sushi/sashimi plate (unless you are feeding kids that are afraid of raw seafood). The marinated hamachi was one of the few enjoyable bites. It would have been better without the marinade as I like to taste the ingredients. Do not get me wrong. We all love spice and spicy dishes. I mean extreme spicy as long as the spice doesn't cover the ingredients' taste. Here Nobu generally failed. It got worse with their Wagyu course. No idea where that old cow came from. There was no sign of tender fattiness that Wagyu is famous for. Just pieces that remind one of shoe leather: both in texture and taste (and I am only exaggerating slightly). It was time for a call to management. They actually brought us a replacement dish. A Peruvian \u00a0style beef dish that was simmered rather than fried. It wasn't a great dish either, but the cooking method seemed to be more compatible with the beef they offered. The spice - a sauce that tasted a lot like tabasco from a bottle - didn't really agree with beef. The manager said that it is a traditional Peruvian spice. If true, I conclude that I do not like Peruvian spice. Frustrated with the food so far, we ordered a few pieces of sashimi and finally Nobu didn't mess up. Mackerel and o-toro were excellent. The scallops might be good for the location, but living in New England spoiled us, and therefore cannot win awards. The razor clams were out. Otherwise, the fish choices seemed pedestrian. Mackerel and o-toro are the winners. On the beverage side, I asked about their Daiginjo. Our waitress said that the Daiginjo is very bland and she recommended one of their other dry sakes, Onigoroshi (at half-price). As I was hesitating, she offered to bring us two cups to try. The recommended sake was not bad, but had too many strong flavors with a hint of a bitter, chemical aftertaste. We stuck to the Daiginjo and were very happy after three large carafes for three people. The standard Nobu Daiginjo has a typical, clean, delicate Niigata flavor. Definitely done right! May be too delicate vor the Peruvian side of the restaurant. Eventually we made it to dessert, which was pleasant and covered some of the earlier pains. Picture to follow ...",

I wish it had a bit more of an exclusive and quiet feel to it but otherwise, enjoyed the simple yet posh environment. Service was spot on. Our waiter was proactive in explaining the menu and prompt throughout the evening in bringing out drinks and dishes. Would most love to return",

Prior to entering the restaurant, you can give your coats and bags to the cloakroom and then go up the stairs to the main restaurant. When we sat down we were given a choice of still or sparkling water (however I would've just gone with tap but I felt too shy to say at the time) and given a drinks and food menu. To drink, I ordered a summer breeze cocktail (vodka, prosecco, raspberries and soda) which was really light and refreshing whilst my boyfriend ordered a virgin Mojito. The cocktails came fairly quickly and were really good! When ordering we had a few bits that had caught our eye, however I asked the waitress her opinion. She was very knowledgeable and when she saw that we were ordering two dishes which had various tempura bits in, she said that she would arrange for them to arrive at separate times which was nice of her. We ordered the Chicken with Teriyaki Sauce and Tempura which came with salad, rice and miso soup and that was delicious!! The chicken was extremely tender and the sauce was sweet and not too sticky or dry. We also had the octopus jalape\u00f1o which was slices of cold octopus in a jalape\u00f1o sauce. I thought that it was different but I liked it. Very tasty. Next there was Lobster Tempura with a Creamy Wasabi sauce and that was absolutely divine! The creamy wasabi sauce complimented the lobster and wasn't over powering. Definitely my favourite dish so far. We couldn't go to Nobu without having sushi so we ordered the California with Crab & Avocado Inside Out cut roll and it was really tasty. I've never had crab sushi before but it was great. For pudding we shared a Chocolate Bento Box which had a flourless chocolate fondant with almond ice cream. The menu stipulated green tea ice cream but I asked if we could change it and the waitress was happy to oblige. It was delicious but very rich. In hindsight I should have ordered something fruitier! Overall Nobu was great. Definitely go there for a special occasion/treat as it is expensive however it's worth it for the food, drink and overall experience you get!",

The roll was replaced with a fresh one but the manager never made an appearance to apologize. Presentation nice, service slightly above average but not special.

    "text": "For such a posh neighbourhood a very mediocre dining experience.I'd been wanting to go to Nobu London for a while as I had tried it in other cities like Miami and found it to be a fashionable and trendy dining experience. Not so in London's Nobu. As a matter of fact it was disappointing from soup to nuts, from hello to goodbye.We arrived, having a confirmed reservation, and well, I found the host a bit off putting and snooty, like he was quite bothered by having to work at all. That was the welcome but I was determined to put that behind us and enjoy the food. The dining room was very noisy and to be honest I can't say too much for the very plain decor which for having the upscale market clientele did not fit. The service too was very sub par. Our waitress really didn't know the menu and when asked questions had to go ask someone else and come back to relay the information, it all just felt 2nd rate. The food too was just OK. Some of our sushi rolls were very basic and uninteresting. Perhaps had we had a waitress who could have made suggestions it might have helped with our selections. We did know our sushi but it might have helped to have tried more of the house specials, that sort of thing. It was all just bland and unexciting. Not to mention the noise in the dining room made it very hard to converse at the table. I was quite ready to leave which is a shame because we were very much looking forward to dining there. To end the whole night out, a quick stop at the toilets resulted in a trek down a back staircase that felt like I was in the back of a nightclub. And the toilets themselves looked like they were from a nightclub. It really highlighted the fact that Nobu is way past its prime. We left looking for someplace else to have dessert.",

My. God. This was inedible. This was supposed to be the star of the show and it was a huge let down. It felt like it was doused in maple syrup. Couldn't taste the fish. Much too sweet and hard to stomach- Toro sashimi: 3/5 the tuna didn't taste like very fresh/high quality fish- Tuna avocado roll: 4/5 eh, very plain but that's just your run of the mill tuna avo roll- Edamame: 5/5 hard to mess up- Sea urchin crispy nori sushi cup: 2/5 I'm usually a big fan of sea urchin but the crispy nori sushi cup felt like burnt/tasteless/cardboard seaweed and it didn't complement the flavour of the sea urchin at all!- Chocolate bento box: 4/5 pretty standard chocolate fondant and the green tea ice cream was also okThe service was really good, our waitress was very attentive, but I would personally never come back here again, especially considering the price for what you get.",

    "text": "The first time in my life at Nobu London was in 1999, we were in London on a short break and had on the day the brilliant idea we want to go to Nobu, and got a table through a few pestering phone calls to a great friend and chef I know, he worked with Mark Edwards on some promotions. (Mark is sort of Global Head Chef and a partner of Nobu Matsuhisa, Nobu has 15+ places from LA to NYC, London to Hong Kong. These are part of the Myriad Restaurant Group, where Robert De Niro and Drew Nieporent are amongst the partners, all big playersthen there is a brand owned by Nobu himself, called Matsuhisa, more boutique style, all very complex and strategic) Back to our experience, I only realized once seated in the restaurant what a celebrity packed hotspot this was. We came from a Swiss mountain village, so this all in a sudden felt like being seated in the first row of a Film Premiere. Anyway, I don't think this interest anybody, the point is, today in 2007 the restaurant still has a great energy, buzz and nothing is inferior then it was back in 1999, except that the customer base is a touch less celeb-ish, more mixed, tourists, punters out for a great treat, business men, etc. Nobu London maintains a 1 Michelin Star since years, and still has one, the service is still very efficient, not always over the top friendly, but the prices are kept steep if not over the top. The Japanese Food with a twist of Peruvian influences is absolutely wonderful, the energy and vibrancy in the restaurant is world class. A magic place that has its price tag. If you go there, never miss the signature dishes that are part of the fame. Edamame beans, Yellowtail Jalapeno, Rock Shrimp Tempura (order with 3 sauces) or Creamy Spicy Shrimp, Black Cod Miso, and then have a selection of Sushi, it is top end, can't get much better then this outside Japan. No matter what, don't miss the desserts, they are a class of its own, from a pastry chef that worked for Adrian Ferra at El Bulli. To drink, maybe try a Bamboo pitcher of Junmai Daignjo quality Sake. I am not always convinced about the new dishes; they are great if one is a repeat customer dining often in Nobu, but for a one off treat, stick to the classics. The thing with the one off treat people is a bit reflected in the customer picture, at the steep prices i.e. for 2 people you easily hit the \u00a3200+ mark, and an exorbitant service charge knocked on top of the bill, understandable For quick and more affordable meals, the Sushi counter, where no reservations are taken, is also a great treat. You can get a good flavour of the buzz in the place around \u00a3110+ for two. Overall, it is an institution and there are newer places on the market, the likes of Zuma, who are for sure heavy competitors and have taken over some of Nobu's regular clientele and fame in the last years. In the end I think, one is a Nobu-san or Zuma-san, all depending on the first experience you had, maybe I am influenced from the 1999 one, and therefore definitely a Nobu-san. (\"Nobu - The World's Sexiest Restaurant\" The Observer, April 2001) NB: Then there is the new Nobu Berkeley Street, for great food go to Park Lane, then for drinks to Berkeley, more clubby feel, the food is not the same, just the prices.",

To start with, the restaurant is very posh, everyone looks better than you, but at least its dark so you can't quite be sure. I really do like the vibe and the music playing during dinner.We decided to get a few sushi dishes (both nigiri and rolls), some cooked dishes (some tempura calamari, some sort of lobster, etc) and overall the food was just ok. I am from San Francisco and believe we have fresher tasting fish in the bay area.If you plan on going, I would suggest to stick to a variety and ask for waiter recommendations (though ours, to be frank, was not very good at suggestions). Overall, if you remove the ambiance and good looking folks, this place is just mediocre, and I would have to say all hype.",

I may have been a bit lost on my own but he knew the ins and outs of the menu and ordered a selction of dishes that blew you away. When your not the most confident with new menus it really makes a difference to go with someone who really knows what he's talking about so my Nobu experience was really of the highest order. This was food on another level completely and really gave me an appreciation of what quality seafood is.

Lucky for me, I was the friend. We somehow nabbed a Friday night reservation and kicked off with cocktails at the bar before being guided to a lovely table looking across to Hyde Park. Everything on the menu looked great, but when the waiter came to take our order and we looked up with those we can't decide faces, he kindly suggested we select the chef's tasting menu. What the hell! We weren't paying. The miso was delicious, the sushi fresh and sashimi dissolved on the tongue. The famous Nobu miso cod was just as good as we'd heard, with a subtle sweetness lingering after each bite and spicy prawns came sizzling to the table in an oh-so Japanese way. Finished off with the refreshing taste of green tea ice cream. Now Nobu has changed rank to my Restaurants to Hit Again Soon list.

I was really courious because it's such a famous place, it has to be THE BEST.We tried the luncheon menu with beef in wasabi sauce, a mixed sushi and sashimi lunch and their signature dish, highly recomended by the waitress: the balck cod everithing with the sake tasting.The food is really good, fresh, amazing flavours.The cod was surprisingly delicious, perfectly cooked and with a lovely subtle sweet flavour.I have to say NOBU has god a way with dressing sauces, everithing was so well balanced and delicious, even the salad dressing (we've been told that's made with 10 ingredients, the main 3 are onions, black pepper and japanese mustard).The beef was perfectly cooked and the wasabi sauce simply delicious.And I'm still thinking about the mouthwatering of the tuna.... sooooo good.Then we tried a bento chocolate box wich is practically a choccolate souffle', served warm with green tea ice cream on the side.The souffle' was perfect, light and crunchy outside with a warm creamy heart. And the ice cream itself was really nice, gentle taste.But the match of them wasn't right for me, the ice cream is just too delicate for the choccolate flavour. It's just not right, the ice cream disappear on your mouth leaving only a cold sensation when you eat the two ingredient together.The staff is really nice, our waitress has been very helpful.Still I didn't like that they cleaned the plates away without asking if we were done (they took away the salad I was slowly enjoying on the side of everything else).They gave us the wrong beef at the beginning, and even if everything was really good, I definitely have to say that is overpriced. It's true you're in central London and you're overlooking hide park but this is not a good reason to let me pay 32 quid for a portion of cod!!A special mention for the toilet which are pretty small (specially because are shared with the meetings room on the 1st floor, but I find amazing the special make up side with armchairs, white light and mirrors to retouch your make up.Still I think whenever I want to eat great japanese food I'll go back to TOSA in chiswick, same level of quality for half the price.",

    "text": "Have eaten at Nobu quite often and have to say that it is unfailingly excellent if horribly expensive...the portions are tiny so you'll end up ordering quite a few dishes and spend more than you meant to but as with everything in life............ you get what you pay for. Try to aviod ordering the things you are familiar with and stray from the beaten track....the wait staff are delighted to oblige....the pork belly was just incredible...cooked perfectly with the fat melting into the meat...also love love love the tempura, light as a feather.... It's not just about the food, the atmosphere always good with an expectant air of A list spotting never too far away....appropriate attire for a night out for a girl is tight jeans...sky scraper heels and a sparkly/sexy top.....which will take you nicely down to the Met Bar for a cocktail and a bop.",

    "text": "Nobu is definitely one of the best restaurants I have been lucky enough to try in London. Although just some of the full height windows benefit of the view on Hide Park, the inside environment is intriguing and pleasant; the designer managed to mix a contemporary-fashion style preserving a easily perceivable Japanese influence. While waiting to be seated at the table, one can enjoy a cold glass of champagne in the comfortable love-seats in the waiting area. Wine list absolutely remarkable although the waiters tend to pour too much wine in a single time. Had delicious fresh filleted tuna and desserts but what absolutely stood out was the black cod. Apart from the exquisite taste, smoked at the right point, it literally melts in your mouth. The black cod is definitely the reason that makes me want to be back. One caveat: when one walks through the glass doors of The Metropolitan Hotel, he has to be aware that his dinner will most likely be very expensive. However, Nobu fully deserves both its Michelin star and the price paid for some of the plates.",

    "text": "I went to Nobu a few months ago for lunch with a friend, and we had a lovely experience. We had a seat by the window overlooking Hyde Park, and it was a nice sunny day.We had 3 dishes, some sushi/sashimi, dessert, and a couple of drinks each. The 3 dishes we ordered were - shrimp and lobster with spicy lemon sauce, pan fried dover sole with red chilli salsa, seafood toban yaki. We also ordered a selecton of sashimi - yellowtail, salmon, sea bream, mackerel, sweet shrimp. For dessert, we both had the chocolate bento box. I had a couple of mojitos with the meal, and my friend had a raspberry cooler.Shrimp & lobster with spicy lemon sauce - A salad of fresh leaves and enoki mushrooms, topped with shrimp and chunky lobster pieces, and a tangy lemon sauce. The dish wasn't swimming in sauce, but there was enough to coat everything and it helped to lift the flavours of the shrimp and lobster. This was a perfect way to start the meal, as my tastebuds were now tingling.Pan fried dover sole with red chilli salsa - this came out next, and I was blown away by the presentation. There were 4 fillets of fish, on a frosted glass plate, swimming in a red chilli salsa, and right in the middle, was the head and backbone of the fish, deep fried and curled up into a \"C\" shape, with the tail suspended in mid-air. The fish was nice and fresh, and again, the sauce was very tasty. Not overpoweringly spicy, but enough to make my tastebuds tingle. We wiped the plate clean.Seafood \"toban\" yaki - this came out last, and I am glad they left it til the end. It was basically a flat claypot with a lid (the \"toban\"), and when you opened it, the aroma that came out was unbelievable. It had a lovely savoury, vinegary smell, and inside the toban were clams, shrimp, fish, swimming in a lovely soy/vinegar sauce. The seafood was firm and fresh, and the sauce was the best of the 3 dishes. It was so good, for the remainder of the meal, I kept stopping to savour the smell as other tables had their \"toban\" yaki delivered to them. I really enjoyed this dish.The sashimi came out next, and by comparison, the \"wow\" factor wasn't there, compared with the previous 3 dishes. The fish was definitely of good quality, but I suppose there wasn't much difference between Nobu's sashimi and other places I've been to (e.g. Inaho, Yoshino). As before, the fish was firm and fresh, but the sweet shrimp was slightly slimy. To finish, we had the chocolate bento box, and it was a chocolate fondant with a scoop of green tea ice cream in a bento box. The fondant itself was good, nice and warm with a lovely gooey, liquid centre. The ice cream was the best green tea ice cream I've had, it had a lovely deep smokey green tea flavour. A good way to end the meal.I also had the vanilla and apple mojito, and the pear and cinnamon mojito. I enjoyed both, and preferred the apple over the pear, as the apple flavour was more distinct, compared with the pear. The glasses were quite generous, and the vodka was nice and strong.The meal ended up costing over \u00a3200, which is quite expensive. I would definitely recommend their special dishes, but wouldn't necessarily go back for the sashimi, as you can get similar quality sashimi at other top japanese restaurants. Worth going to for a treat.",

This is one place that lives up to the hype and (if it's possible) tops it. I'm not even a big fan of Japanese food, but you'd have to be mad not to love Nobu. I don't think you can go wrong no matter what you pick from the menu, but the famous black cod with miso lives up to its reputation, the yellowfin sashimi was absolutely outstanding, and the seared beef with spring onion and garlic chips left me speechless. I've never eaten so much raw or seared food in my life, but I am now completely converted. The staff were friendly, incredibly efficient and looked after us brilliantly, and I really can't fault the place for food and service. The main restaurant looked bustling and atmospheric from what I saw, with plenty of movers and shakers and an appearance from Kylie (or so the tramp outside told one of my fellow diners!) If you want a memorable dinner, this is definitely the place to go. Just bear in mind that everything you eat afterward will be a disappointment!",

We had various delicious dishes, and my favourite was definitely the black cod - that is my recommendation to anyone reading this review!
