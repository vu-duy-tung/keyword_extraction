    "text": "It has been a long time since I've been to Rasa Sayang, but I remember it almost as clearly as the day I went. Fortunately, \"review drafts\" help with triggering vital memories, such as the torrential downpour of the unfortunate day we chose to go (but then again, isn't London almost constantly in a perpetual state of downpour??), or the flavorful savory carrot cake I ordered AFTER I finished my entire entree AND nitpicked off of my friend's leftovers. If anyone has had dim sum before, the savory carrot cake is a tremendously tastier version of lau bak goh (turnip cake). it's definitely heavier than most of the other dishes at Rasa Sayang, but somehow I managed to polish it off mostly by myself after I devoured every edible piece of flesh off my Fish Assam (also delicious, if a bit meager)I guess the only dishes I could have done without were the Singapore fried rice & the vermicelli noodles, which I probably would not have ordered on my own anyway. Nothing wrong with either of them, but they cannot compare (even in the menu pictures!) to the chili crab, nasi lemak, or ANY Of the more interesting dishes! I think even if you knew nothing about Malaysian food (which I cannot claim expertise in, but still mosied my way through the menu) you can still find plenty of gems to keep you coming back to Rasa Sayang.",

    "text": "I've never understood why the Straits cuisine of Malaysia and Singapore isn't more popular. Given the popularity of Chinese, Indian and Thai food in the UK, you'd have thought it'd be a winner especially as it has much in common with all three. Whilst Indian is the traditional choice for post-pub dining, I reckon Straits cuisine would make for great way to end the evening. To put this theory to the test, I met up with my old mate, the Italian Shetland Pony, his missus and a few other muckers on a pre-Christmas Friday night out. After a few beers in Soho \u00a0all in the cause of research \u00a0we pitched up at Rasa Sayang sometime after 11pm. Being a bit of a control freak, I took charge and ordered some sides to share - 3 portions of roti canai, a portion of curry cheong fan (both pictured above) and 2 portions of spring rolls. The coconutty curry sauce in the first two dishes was really zingy and I wish I ordered more of the cheong fan as these rice noodles were very more-ish. For the mains, I let people order their own - I had beef rendang (pictured above) \u00a0spicy yet with the distinct taste of the coconut milk coming through. ISP ordered a giant bowl of curry laksa (photo at top) and I guess he enjoyed it as he soon polished it off. Other mains included nasi lemak and a couple of dishes that I didn't make a proper note of \u00a0one was a stir fried noodle dish of Hokkien origins and the other was a chicken curry served with roti. A great end to a great evening - Straits cuisine is ideal for late night dining be you sober or drunk. Rasa Sayang is far superior to your average late night ruby and much better value too. The damage was a mere \u00a314/head including service and a round of drinks. Update - July 2010 A quick mention for my favourite dish here, fried fish vermicelli (\u00a36.90). In Cantonese, this dish is called yu tou fen, which translates as fish head vermicelli ! As well as the fried fish head, this dish includes fried fish, preserved veg, tomatoes, tung choi (morning glory), and rice vermicelli in a broth topped with fried shallots and spring onion. As with many of the best soup noodle dishes, it's the broth that makes the dish. In this case, the milky broth is different class, with fishy undertones cut through with the almost medicinal qualities of Chinese wine/tonic. This is a if Carlsberg did noodles bowl of noodles and whilst fish head may not be to all tastes, it is in my opinion, one of the finest noodle dishes in London. eatlovenoodles.blogspot.\u2026",

    "text": "Rasa Sayang - Pics @ The London Foodie(thelondonfoodie.co.uk ) Besides San Francisco and Shanghai, there is only one other place that I feel can rival London's culinary diversity, and that is Singapore. I would gladly take a 12-hour flight to be able to eat there. The countless food courts, their wonderful Chilli Crab, the oyster omelettes that melt in your mouth, are just some of the many reasons why I keep going back. I love Singapore, and in my latest trip, I also discovered the most delicious Straits Chinese food. I first came across the concept of Straits Heritage Cuisine a few years ago in Malacca, former capital of Malaysia. Straits Chinese food can refer to the cuisine that has evolved from the inter-racial marriages of descendants of late 15th and 16th century Chinese immigrants with natives of the region of Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. Peranakan and Baba-Nyonya are also the commonly used terms in Malay to describe this marriage of cultures and food. Needless to say, that the food is superb, complex, and richly flavoured with regional spices and pastes. Rasa Sayang is not entirely Nyonya. Their menu is predominantly Malaysian/Singaporean hawker street food, and contains some of these nations' favourite dishes like Chilli Crab, Char Kuay Teow and Pan-fried Carrot Cake. I was glad however to see some of my favourite Nyonya dishes in the menu like Ayam Sambal (chicken stewed in rich coconut curry) and Stir Fried Sambal Cluster Beans. It was with much anticipation that I arranged to visit Rasa Sayang with my delightful Malaysian friend Charmaine Chow and her partner. I have been lucky enough to have experienced Charmaine's Malaysian cooking a number of times, and knew that I would be in very good hands when ordering. Rasa Sayang is simply decorated, aiming at functionality as opposed to style or comfort. The restaurant is small and the lighting is searingly bright. This is not a place designed to be restful but more like a canteen or a shopping mall eatery with a high turnover of customers and pushy waitresses. We started with Hainanese Chicken with rice (\u00a36.90) which we both agreed was very tender and succulent. I love the simplicity of this dish and the fact that the flavours come mostly from the delicious broth the chicken is cooked in. The broth is also served with accompanying rice. This was followed by the pan fried carrot cake (\u00a36.50) which was superb. Despite the name, the dish has no carrots but is made of pieces of rice cake & shredded radish (Japanese Daikon). These are pan-fried and served with bean sprouts, onions and other condiments. This was delicious and one of the best dishes of the evening. The Char Kuay Teow (\u00a36.60) was just as I remember having in the food courts of Malaysia and Singapore. The noodles were beautifully charred and combined well with the rich, dark and sweet soy sauce giving an intense flavour I have never managed to replicate at home. The seafood was good but not as abundant as it might have been, and the rice noodles soft and slippery like a good cheung fung. This is street hawker food at its best. The Nyonya Ayam Sambal (Chicken Stewed in Rich Coconut Curry @ \u00a36.90) was again amazing. The curry base (rempah) was incredibly complex, with hints of ginger, red chillies, cumin, coriander and belachan (Indonesian shrimp paste). I love belachan - despite the strong fishy smell and flavour, it is definitely an ingredient with a lot of umami. We also ordered a couple of vegetable dishes \u00a0the Stir Fried Sambal Cluster Beans and Sambal Ladyfingers priced at \u00a36.50 and \u00a35.80 respectively. They were both excellent, and Charmaine and I had no trouble polishing them off with the extra portions of rice we ordered. The ladyfingers were nicely cooked, still pleasantly firm and not viscous. Charmaine was very impressed with the quality and authenticity of all dishes that we tried, and our dinner companions and I agreed with her heartily. Our meal, at \u00a346.20 for four people, would have been perfect had it not been for the poor level of waiting service. Verdict \u00a0Wonderful, authentic Straits Cuisine in modest surroundings, and at very reasonable prices. The unfriendliness of the staff needs to be addressed. A place to explore the still relatively undiscovered Straits Chinese and Peranakan Cuisines in London. I will certainly return.",

    "text": "Easily one of the more surprising finds of recent times, this unassuming malaysian diner looks like your usual 'big bowl' fare, but sit down and pick out some gems within the menu, order a pot of tea (or something stronger) and prepare your tastebuds for an adventure.Standout dishes for me were the Home Made Tofu in sweet cucumber and chili dressing, and the Carrot Cake which is actually a savoury fried dish that's both comforting and utterly delicious. I tried some of the less familiar dishes on the menu, so I can't vouch for the 'curry and rice' dishes \u00a0I would instead urge you to go with someone equally hungry \u00a0and share!For those who like spicy, try the Lontong, which consists of compressed rice and a vegetable curry sauce slightly hotter than the Sun's core. For those with less masochistic tastes, the staff will steer you towards gentler, yet still highly flavoursome food. They (refreshingly) know a lot about what's on the plate, so those with a dairy or gluten intolerance will breathe a sigh of relief as you will be told exactly what to expect.Reasonably priced and beautifully presented, I went here twice in 3 days just to check it was as tasty as I remembered \u00a0and it was. Both times I came in starving, and left rather full and satisfied. Five stars!Starter and main coursel for two with tea: around \u00a320would suit: friendly pre-cinema meal, really hungry people. room for large groups downstairs",

I ordered their fried sambal fish - fantastic! The service was fast and friend and the food was absolutely delicious! Highly recommended.",

It's a carbo-lovers delight with heaping piles of noodles and a scarcity of much of anything else.The shaved ice with red bean dessert was terrible. The ice was partially crushed and the topping lacked much of any flavor.I can't say I'd return, but it's worth checking out to see if it suits your fancy.",

To say I left disappointed is an understatement: I realise that sometimes these places can be a bit hit and miss, as they don't have the same professionalism or service standards control that more expensive establishments strive for but I can forgive a slow waitress service, a forgotten side salad or poor seating if the food was good. Unfortunately it wasn't. The Straits Chicken Curry came out within 3 minutes of ordering and although the sauce was delightfully hot and creamy, the chicken was lukewarm in the middle and drier than a pair of lips in a sandstorm. My partner's Singapore Noodles can only be described as grey in colour and flavour and we've had better in the hundreds of cheap noodle bars. And then to top off the very brief and dissappointing lunch, they somehow lost our order of pandan pancakes and so we waited 15 minutes for something that never arrived. Maybe I'll come back and give these guys another shot as they were busy and I could've caught them on a bad day. I really hope it wasn't through lack of effort on there part.

It's a bit on the expensive side (\u00a324 for 2 beers, 2 mains, and a single shared starter), it's about as bright as daylight, and the beef dish was swimming in oil.

When we started the meal I thought, okay, this is a 3/5, but as we ate, that number just got lower and lower. 1. The rice was too mushy and didn't taste of much (and we know it's all about the rice) 2. It's served with curry chicken. Really? It's not like they don't have fried chicken on the menu! 3. The sambal they served it with definitely wasn't sambal, it wasn't even chili. I could go on forever about why this dish was just so wrong but basically the only thing right was the sliced cucumber. Feel like the rule is to stick with what you/your friends know!Also, they have sth like a \u00a36 minimum per person which is pretty off-putting, like 'pay up or you're not worth our time'. Eww.",

It wasn't too expensive, the service was cordial and not too wordy (not a huge fan of waiters who fawn over you), and the food was pretty good all around. My mom really enjoyed it, and said it was simple and fresh food.I stopped by again when I was in the neighborhood, just to eat by myself, and had another really good experience. Some places are really hard to eat at when you're alone, but Rasa Sayang is really cool. I had a delicious hokkien mee, which arrived really quickly. It definitely wasn't the best I've ever had, but for the price, it was good value. The waitstaff stayed out of my hair for the most part, but was really quick to respond.Overall, good experiences all around.",

Since not all of us were that hungry, and the cost of an average dish there is just under \u00a38, they were clearly insisting that we order more than we might want to, and as this wasn't up for discussion, we all left. This was sad to me as the food is great and very affordable, but this time the service let us down.",

The soup was OK, the rice was so-so (not supple enough, not fragrant enough), the chicken was an ample amount given (5-6 thick slices with the skin on top and some nice soya souce, the chili sAUCeee was decent....2) Too expensive. 8 quid for chicken rice? That's like 16 sgd = 4 chicken rices in a kopitiam. WTF.*anyway I realized everything in chinatown/london is expensive. but still. dayum.3) Chicken rice wasn't good nuff for me. I will continue my search to find the best chicken rice in London. K PEACE OUT ^.^*also why is the rice brownish looking? the rice should look yellowy/shiny right? amirite?",

    "text": "Good Malaysian food in London has been somewhat elusive ever since the closure of Satay Stick (on Dering Street I believe...I still remember how delicious their chicken wings were) back in 1999 and, whilst there is a plethora of Thai, Cantonese, Japanese and Vietnamese restaurants around, Malaysian restaurants are comparatively few and scattered around. I used to like Kiasu in Bayswater before it got closed down for reasons including, but not limited to: mouse in sauce pot; cockroach eggs in prawn cracker baskets; rodent droppings all over kitchen. \u00a0Their owner is now in prison I believe.I'd been meaning to check out Rasa Sayang for a while but never got round to it, one of the main reasons being that it's Halal. \u00a0Not that I have anything against Halal food, but I have to say that Hokkien Mee just isn't the same without the fried crispy pork lard garnish. \u00a0The interior is pretty standard, not dissimilar to nearby C&R Cafe, but somewhat more spacious. \u00a0I've enjoyed my two meals here - the beef rendang is well-flavoured (also very spicy) and the Hainan gai fun (steamed chicken rice) is generously portioned with tasty rice, and comes with the soup (unlike some places).On food alone, the three stars may seem a little stingy. \u00a0Generally, I turn a blind eye to sub-par service, but Rasa Sayang is really poor in this department. \u00a0The last time I went, the waiter was rather unfriendly at the beginning (granted, it was Friday night) and shoved the two of us on a 4-person table already occupied by two. \u00a0This was in spite of the fact that there was a free two-person table downstairs. \u00a0When it came to ordering I could still detect a hint of contempt from the waiter. \u00a0Then the food came. \u00a0Food should not be lukewarm. \u00a0I understand that Friday night is a stressful time, but even so, there is a basic standard and Rasa Sayang failed to meet it. \u00a0Cheap and good, perhaps, but I am on the fence about going back.",

This is far and away my favorite Malaysian place in London, and the high quality of the Nasi Lemak is a big part of that equation.But there's more. The Roti Canai is as glorious as any I've ever had, and I liked the Char Kuay Teow. I want to try everything in this place (but then again, it's hard not to get Nasi Lemak, so who knows if I'll manage to try much else- OK, maybe the Laksa).Finally, get a cup of Teh Tarik to wash it all down and you will be glad you did. Now if I could only find a place that serves century eggs on a stick at 3am, my Malaysian experience will be complete.",

I won't pretend I can judge Rasa's authenticity, but I will say the food is extremely well made and bursting with flavor. Seafood lovers should dive into the Tamarind Assam Fish, as tender fish in fragrant, chile-filled sauce is a particular specialty of this region. For dessert, you can't go wrong with the perennial Kueh Dadar, which Rasa does amazingly well. I'm not sure if that's real pandan juice in there or just artificial flavoring, but the filling is spot on.Service is what you expect for a bustling Asian restaurant: brisk, efficient, but not altogether unfriendly. The clientele were a mix of Asians and non-Asians, but even if you're dining alone, this is a place where you can really enjoy yourself.",

Their kway teow was chock full of squid that could not be substituted with chicken, and tasted blandly monotonous. Malaysian food is known for its harmonious mix of delicious spices. This...tasted like soy sauce.Tables are positioned too close for comfort, and you may need to shimmy your way to your seat at someone's shoulder.

I thought the curry chicken portion was plentiful and I left very full, however DH hoped for a bigger portion of his dish. As far as flavor and style of the dishes, I have only one other Malaysian restaurant to compare it to in NYC. The curry flavor of my dish was very strong, which I prefer, but it did seems bit oily.

The roti canai and laksa are pretty damn close to the real thing back home. As is their char kway teow and various mee gorengs. You can even get Ice Milo or Milo Dinosaur! And it's not just me who thinks it's authentic. Everytime I go there I always hear other Singaporean accents from the patrons around me and once even bumped into an old classmate from Singapore there! I take every new friend of mine to eat here seeing as they probably will never be able to visit me in Singapore so this is the next best thing.",

It had a good taste to it and thick broth with the addition of coconut milk. Unfortunately, that was the only thing that was good with the curry laksa. The noodles were overcooked making it extremely soggy and the shrimp serving was a joke. I got 2 half of a shrimp of the size of a quarter (American coin size). Another thing that made it rather bland ( not the soup) was the fact that everything was probably cooked on a hot water prior to adding the soup \u00a0thus making all of the other items tasteless. The shrimp, tofu, noodles had a bland taste to it. The wait staffs were friendly and quick. During a lunch rush, I was able to sit, order and leave within 30 minutes. I'll probably come back and try something else in the near future but noodle soup won't be one of them.",

Although it was late, there were still quite a few tables dining.I ordered the Char Kuay Teow with Hainanese Chicken. They really love soy sauce here because the chicken (which was dry) was drowning in it, and the noodles also had too much soy sauce. If they lightened up on it, then it has the potential to be pretty good - the noodles had a good consistency to it, and the overall flavor was great.I tried the sauce from the chili crab (was too lazy to actually have a crack at the crab), and it was flavorful. It had the perfect amount of spiciness to it, and the eggs made the sauce smooth and creamy. While I probably wouldn't come back for the noodles/chicken, I wouldn't mind having some of that chili crab next time!",

The latter was not that great, but the chow fun is decent. \u00a0Price is good but the basement venue is surprisingly congested and kind of uncomfortable. In case of fire, it would not be a good thing.Getting used to American style, the tight space in UK restaurant just got me very nervous. Cannot believe UK allows so many tiny restaurants and basement dining!Service is ok. A lot of people! Will go back to check it out. However, so far, 3 stars!",

    "text": "Good food, but ambiance was nonexistent...this place is definitely no frills. If they worked on what this place looked like, it would be more of a hit. Regardless, the portions were HUGE for a lot of the menu options and included a ton of stuff. The beef rendang was full of flavor, and so were the other dishes that I do not remember the names of. Prices for what you get are extremely worth it. If this place looked nicer, it would definitely deserve 4 stars in my book...but many people on different occasions said how good it was, so I guess it's already a hit.",

All tasted quite good but obviously you can tell it was not a healthy meal (like any Oriental food, focus in flavour and heat).The milk tea was good too :)4 stars because the kuey diao could see more meat/seafood in it, and the Loh mee can see a little more veggies. Maybe overall less salt too :)Certainly recommend though, especially in London this would be one of the rare gems for decent Asian food!",

    "text": "If you've no idea what Malaysian or Singaporean food IS (rather than \"roughly Chinese\"), you may leave a bit disappointed. \u00a0The cuisine is as specific as the places themselves, and so deserving of a unique yard stick. \u00a0Here's my quick run-down of the place:First - ambiance is terrible. \u00a0But it doesn't really matter in this case, it's food and company.Second - the food itself is very good. \u00a0Not great, but very good. \u00a0The meats are tender and the fish tastes fresh. \u00a0The noodles are pretty standard, and the composition of dishes are complex enough to keep you interested, but I wouldn't call it amazing.Third - the service is perfectly fine. \u00a0Very attentive, but in the way that diner waiters are attentive: they give you what you need, but don't expect a friendly chat about all 10 of their hot noodle dishes.Fourth - the sweet stuff is nice and interesting, but by no means best in class. \u00a0The deserts can be had better elsewhere, but good enough to give a go when your second stomach requires some filling up at the end of the meal.Fifth - price is right. \u00a0Nothing too expensive here, and portion size is good for what you get.Four stars - authentic, very good food at the right price without any frills.",

    "text": "Rasa Sayang is one of those no frill no fuss restaurants serving a good variety of Malaysian and Singaporean dishes at a really budget friendly price. Food isn't exceptional but generous and adequate flavour to leave you satisfied. It's home comfort food renowned for it's big bowls of noodles and one plate dishes. The menu can be overwhelming as there are so many choices, even dessert which is quite rare. On the positive note you can be sure to find something you like.Service is very efficient and friendly too. Food served quick and with two floors, there's barely a wait for a table when things get busy although I have seen a short queue forming outside sometimes. .Teh tarikHighly recommend getting a Malaysian milk tea. Lovely, full bodied and sweeten by strong notes of condensed milk making it incredibly tasty. Comes hot or cold.Curry chee Cheung fun. Not the best in presentation. Expect no more than a few basic steamed rice flour pancakes rolled up and the curry sauce poured over it. All the flavour was contained within the fragrant spicy curry sauce itself. Something incredibly simple but turned out to be a nice comforting dish.Indian rojak This was delicious. Almost like onion Bhajis being deep fried and being crisp on the outside but more eggy and doughy in the inside. What made it more enticing was the lovely peanut sauce on top adding more depth and flavour through its sweet spiced nuttiness flavours, beautifully contrasted with the refreshing cucumbers and blanched beansprouts underneathLor mee. Being a big lover of thick sauce based dishes things I was really satisfied with this dish. Lovely thick rounded yellow wheat noodles in a starchy gravy made from the remaining braising juices from the five spice chicken. The gravy had depth from the chicken and array of spice. It was salted nicely with soy and sweetened by rock sugar. Being starchy it held its heat in quite well even though we had it last. The chicken was tender and flavoursome from the braising process and it was a generous portion too.Fried fish bee hoon. Lovely flavours arising from the m broth that was filled with nice aromas of fish and milkiness from the evaporated milk. It would have nicer if it was richer in flavour but for the price I didn't expect an amazing version. Together with the pickled salty mustard greens it became very appetising. Never been a big fan of thin rice vermicelli but being thin and having the ability to hold more of it in on a pair of chopsticks, it blended really well with all the assorted greens and fish without slipping away.Kangkong balacan Also known as morning glory cooked in shrimp paste. Sadly it was disappointing. The greens itself was a bit old and tough, full of fibers and not possible to chew through completely. It also lacked wok energy so flavours did not infuse it completely although seasoning was spot on.Kueh dadar This was incredible for those who have a sweet tooth like me. Nice thin bouncy pancakes with aromas of pandan although light in flavour. It worked really well against the rougher filling of rich shredded coconut drenched in caramelised palm sugar. Be careful. It's very sweet!Bubar pulut hitam Very similar to a rice pudding but with a more pronounced texture of the individual grains of the red rice being less starchy. It was warm and comforting being creamed by the nice fragrant coconut milk. Flavours were nice much lighter although very filling.Rasa Sayang is a place I keep returning to especially when I can't decide where to eat last minute. With such a large range of dishes on their menu from curries, light soup noodles to simple stir fries, it's easy to satisfy most of my hunger cravings and hard to disappoint. Seasoning is always spot on, nothing too salty or bland. The place is swimming with students because it is so budget friendly and portions are very generous too. One day I hope to have tried everything on the menu.",

I tried the deluxe seafood set menu for \u00a316.99. It came with a drink, main and desert. My main was the Malaysian thick sauce noodle called Lor Mee, which was huge and a bit too rich for my taste. My friend who also had the same menu as me and he loved it. I didn't like the idea that the waiting staff are too rushy rushy. They seemed to want you to get out as fast as possible. The drink, main and desert all came out at the same time. I will come back again some other time to give this restaurant another chance. There's potential here, but it was let down by the service.",

It is has been recommended in multiple write-ups in Timeout, Evening Standard etc. My 2 colleagues were both brought up in Malaysia and also rate it as one of, if not the best Malaysian restaurants in town. It makes for a nice change to the standard Chinese food that you get in the majority of China town restaurants. In my opininion their best dishes are the Char Kway Teow, Beef Rendang, Laksa Noodle Soup, Nasi Goreng, and the Roti Chenai. The Singapore noodles, Hkien Mee and Nasi Lemak also seem quite popular but I'm less fussed. Will be going back before too long I'm sure.",

The roti canai was piping hot and had a good chilli kick to it. The char kway teow was nice, but needed more seafood and perhaps some fresh chives to freshen it up a bit. My partner ordered the chicken wings and hokkien mee. The chicken wings were nicely spiced, but the hokkien mee was too salty and lacked flavour, it was really just a bowl of salty sloppy noodles. I'd come back to try other dishes as I like Malaysian and haven't yet found a decent priced alternative.",
