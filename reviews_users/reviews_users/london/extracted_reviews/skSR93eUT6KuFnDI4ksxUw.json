    "text": "So, during my first two full nights in London I had take-away from two Indian restaurants that are literally right next door to each other and half-a-block from my place. I figure I should make them two of my first reviews, and might as well knock it out in a two-fer review. Here we go.The two places are The Rajadoot, with the prime corner position, weighing in at 3.5 stars on 2 reviews, and Bombay Spice coming in with 4.5 stars on a hefty 4 reviews. In short -- they both serve fine food, but so far I don't see what all the \"London has the best Indian food in the world!!!111one!\" fuss is about.With a one-full-star lead, and twice the review count, Bombay Spice easily won my business the first night. I was at first put off by the white table clothes, but upon further observation of the city I have determined that there must be a law here that requires all Indian restaurants have white table clothes. Once inside the feeling was relaxed, not pretentious, and the staff was very friendly and attentive.At Bombay Spice I decided to go with the tried and true Butter Chicken. It was obvious that the dish was made with love of quality ingredients, and I especially liked the addition of sliced almonds, but the spicing was too bland for my pallet. It was disappointing because the rice was so fragrant and appealing that I would guess that this place is not afraid to spice things appropriately. This might have been just a poor order, but it was listed on the \"chef's suggestions\" portion on the menu, so they do not get a pass.The next night I found myself hungry late night at 10:15PM on a Sunday, with just about everything in sight closed. After being rejected from a couple of other places I begrudgingly decided to go for Indian again. Obviously too embarrassed to go to the place I went the night before, I headed for Rajadoot and was happy to see the 3 bored staffers gaze upon me expectantly as I approached the door. It turns out they are open noon to midnight, 7 days a week, including holidays.At first I was going to play it safe again and order the Chicken Tikka Masala. But, after being upsold on an appetizer, I discussed Chicken Tikka Korai (which I had never had) with the waiter. He sold me on it primarily by saying it was \"medium spicy\". Remembering the rather bland Butter Chicken from the previous night I decided to switch things up I told him to change my order because I liked things very spicy. He replied: \"If you like spicy that's a good choice, I things very spicy, but for you, medium spicy.\" To my disappointment, it turned out that I couldn't even detect the spiciness in the dish. And the appetizer was a bland fried shrimp. But, the flavors in the Korai were actually good, so if I could get it actually spicy maybe this place could earn an extra star.In the end, two more Indian restaurants that confirm my feelings on Indian food: meh -- 3 stars each.",

    "text": "I've been going to Rajdoot since I moved to the area in 1996 - it has become my default \"go-to\" Indian, consistently good food and excellent service without being pushy. Since I moved to the US a few years ago I don't get to dine there as often as I used to, but I make it a point to go there at least once every time I'm in London.Last went there on March 18 2016, and was a bit taken aback - there's new staff, much younger than previously, the balti didn't come in a little brass bucket and the pickles weren't in steel cruet. I had a momentary panic - new management can often spell the end for a good restaurant. Fortunately my fears were groundless. Talking to Ruben, the maitre d', it turns out that the original owners have taken well-deserved retirement and have turned the restaurant over to sons and nephews. The boys have changed a few things cosmetically, but the food is just as good as it ever was. The menu has changed a bit also, more prominence given to the Chef's Specials, but the balti (my favourite) is still top-notch, the pappadums are perfectly crisp without being excessively oily, and while the pickles are now in little ramekins they are just as I remember them. The service has become a little more attentive in terms of explaining dishes to people who might not be as familiar with the cuisine, but certainly not pushy. Great job, guys - keep up the excellent work! Looking forward to seeing you next time I'm in town!",

If there are two of you then the starter selection, one curry and either one rice or naan but not both would suffice. So we paid more than we should have. Came to 51+ GBP (which included 2 pints of lager). Would have been less than 40 had we known to order less. 4/5 only because the downstairs dining room isn't brilliant. But it hands down was the best meal we had during our 4 1/2 days in London. Ring and book and ask to be seated upstairs. You won't be disappointed.",

However, the waiter tried to upsell me on my first choice (chicken tikka masala), stating they could not make that spicy. Um, really? I lived in LA my whole life where we have some pretty fantastic Indian food and that's never been a problem. Oddly enough (yes, I'm being cheeky), the tikka masala was 7.95 and he was recommending a dish that was 10.95. My spidy senses knew better and I stuck with the tikka masala.I got some lamb samosas and those were very tasty, although rather small. The tikka masala was \u00a0awful. It was way too sweet. Also, I had asked for mint chutney and they acted like they knew what I was talking about. Um, no. Absolutely, no. I was served a white sauce with a hint of green (mint?) in it. It was disgustingly sweet and awful. I will post a photo later. The papadam they gave me was good, but I had no chutney to complement it. So sad. I wish I could write a better review. I didn't touch the chicken- it is in my hotel refrigerator and even when I'm hungry I can't bring myself to try to eat any of it. Steer clear of this place unless you are just looking for some snack-sized samosas!",

All of the portions were a pretty good size. 3 friends and I split 2 dishes with a side of vegetables and a side of rice and we were all full. The waiter tried really hard to upsell, so beware of that. Overall, the service was pretty slow and the upselling was very annoying, but the food was delicious.",

Took my jacket and scarf, shook my hand and introduced themselves, answered all of my questions, made food suggestions and even ended the meal with a hot leon towel and a piece of chocolate.The food was pretty good. I ordered the chicken tikka massala and the waiter talked me into the chef's version of it. I asked for it to be a little spicy but there was no spice at all. It was pretty good, nothing to complain about but nothing unbelievable. The garlic cheese naan was hands down the best part of the meal. \u00a0For the main dish, rice, and naan it was 13 pounds after the 20% student discount. I enjoyed the service and the food was pretty good. I bet I will be back a couple times in the next few months.",

Here is where the service starts to get shadey. The lamb biryani comes with a side dish of the SAME exact mixed vegetable curry that we ordered, so why couldn't the waiter point that fact out and ask us if this is indeed what we want to order because it's just double of what we have coming? It doesn't hurt to make sure by asking us! What drove the fishy night further is the tipping part. The bill reads s/c, to which the waiter said it's \"service charge\" and insists it's not a tip. He basically stood over us with the machine, and waited for us to punch in an additional tip amount. This is despicable. I don't recommend coming here unless you feel the need to be generous and donate to the so-called needy.",

The food was unforgettable and cant wait to go back. So much flavor and the service, I cant say enough about the service. Shook our hands and made some great menu suggestions and even whipped up some special treats for us. I also have to say I did have a chance to dine on the so called \"worlds greatest Indian Food\" on Brick land and that was less than 1 star compared to the Rajdoot. I was so disgusted with Brick Lane restaurants and this was such a relief from the gimmicky sales pitches of BL. Really need to go back to Rajdoot next time I am in London. We loved it!!

We'd been impressed with the culinary diversity in the city and have been jonesing for some naan and Indian curries. Upon entering Hussain took amazing care of us... rather than ordering we asked him to bring us his favorite dishes... needless to say he knocked it out of the park. The location (next to the park), the simple open window ambience is quaint yet the food stole the show. Enjoy",

This was my first time having Indian food outside the US and had heard it's a must try in London. We were not disappointed, it was probably the best Indian food I've ever had. The only downside to this establishment is that it's 5000 miles away from where I live - wish I could go all the time. If I'm ever in London I will be back!",

As a warning, space is quite small and waiters and other patrons are always jostling in the very narrow aisles between tables, especially between tables. At one point, someone swept utensil (and thankfully not food) off our table as they tried their best to squeezePortions are moderately sized but moderate is all you need for heavy Indian food. The chicken tikka masala is much less creamy than I'm used to, but the chicken was very tender. We also ordered tarka daal which I personally don't love, but my dinner companion seemed to appreciate. Highlight was the garlic naan which was well seasoned and perfectly pillowy at the edges. Unfortunately, I felt that the food we ordered lacked depth of flavor compared to my expectations of Indian food.",

The restaurant is family owned, and the brother's running the operation were not only friendly, but incredibly capable servers who made sure we were ordering exactly the meal to sate our palates. The food was ready in a timely manner and everything was cooked to perfection. The dish for which they named their restaurant was definitely a treat: a mix of both chicken and lamb curried with a sweetness complimenting a potent blend of spices. And to round out the entire meal the chai is the perfect blend of spices and herbs presented in a tall and inviting glass. This was a great pick for our first meal in the city and we'll definitely be going again.",

    "text": "I came here for dinner the other night and had a great experience. We made a reservation for a party of 7 people and were immediately taken downstairs to our table. My first impressions was that the restaurant was very presentable and that the staff were very friendly. My mom and I got there slightly earlier than everyone else in our party, so we started off with a bottle of wine and a couple of starters. They had a pretty nice selection of wines on their wine menu. We started off with the \"cheese and garlic naan,\" which was excellent! However, I think they accidentally gave us just the plain garlic naan so I was a little bummed about that. Regardless, their naan was fantastic. We also all each ordered the \"chutneys\" (onion salad, pickle, mango chutney, & mint sauce) which came with their crispy flatbread. This was really cool to try. All of the chutneys were very interesting (and some a little spicy)! We also started with the tomato chom chom (fried crispy tomato stuffed with homemade cheese and minced meat). I highly recommend the tomato chom chom--great flavor, interesting, and delicious! It was done perfectly. For my entree, I ordered the \"lamb tikka masala.\" I also split an order of rice with others at the table because it goes really well with it. The lamb tikka masala was also really good! I highly recommend it. The lamb was tender and flavorful and the dish wasn't overly salty. Overall, the service was very good. In fact, it was some of the best service that we have had while in London. The only thing that made us a little uncomfortable was the fact that the server was lingering very closely to us and watching us as we were figuring out how to split the bill amongst our party. We all felt a little rushed because of it. Other than that, everything was wonderful. Clean, nice restaurant, friendly staff, fair prices, good service, and great food! I highly recommend :)",

We were not hungry from snacking all day but by the time it was 11pm, we wanted something to warm ourselves in this dreadful snowstorm. After calling the restaurant, they were willing to stay open a bit longer to serve us and the food was delicious! Everything was custom made with our requests... I'm not a big fan of lamb so they took it out of the rice dish I ordered. The spice level was perfect. The texture of the garlic nan was perfect dipping and eating with my aloo gobi and curries!",

The chicken masala was sweeter than expected, but overall very tasty. The veggie curry was good, but the lamb was dry and tough. We do highly recommend you eat here on your next visit to London.",
