Everytime I have been to Sarastro's the food has been delicious and the atmosphere even more so... The waiters are fabulous and have always looked after my friends and I extremely well. The toilets are also fabulous - not for prudes or people who lack a sense of fun though! Consider yourself warned! More than a restaurant... this is an experience!!!",

They were hilarious for adults but maybe not so appropriate for a restaurant that claims to offer a child-friendly atmosphere. Luckily I went with two colleagues and not any children. On second thought, it's not very lucky - we are all suffering from gastrointestinal illness today. My guess is that this is from the shellfish we ate (2 x prawns, 1 x mussels) - salmonella maybe? The food itself wasn't awful, it's just that there wasn't much of it. For example, at \u00a314.50 I got 5 (possibly contaminated) prawns and a very small mixed green salad. And the service wasn't much better. We were practically begging them to give us the dessert menu, most likely out of starvation! A terrible experience.",

I remember getting some attitude from the receptionist when arrived since I was late, though it was only late by ten minutes. We were crammed right next to other people and could barely squeeze between the tables. I remember having the dover sole, fairly large and well cooked (though still very juicy). It's main attraction is the cheesy threatre decore surrounding the place with many old theatre props hanging around the roof, on the walls and all around you. The menu wasn't particularly memorable but as long as you realise you're going for the atmosphere, then I guess you'll do okay.",

    "text": "Went there for lunch a couple of saturdays ago. The mains were decent. I had seafood linguine, and it was a proper italian \"primo\" portion. So any gentlemen - or ladies, let's not discriminate - of generous appetites, beware, you shall need to order a second plate or a meat/fish \"secondo\". The pasta was nicely cooked, properly al dente if I remember correctly, and the seafood was fresh and delicious. My friend had an oven-cooked lamb dish which smelled divine, and she said it tasted lovely as well. Our disappointment came at dessert. And this is what has lost this place a few stars. Excited about the pasta, I ordered tiramisu! My favourite dessert. Now thing is, my boyfriend is italian, and I have often made this at home for us or for friends. And my tiramisu is good. And I know what the original ingredients, assembly, and so on are like. So when a slice of cheesecake-looking tarte with some cement-block-like base was offered, I shivered. It honestly looked like it came out of a box from tesco's (not even M&S). I tried it. I think I made it to 3 reluctant \"how bad can it be\" bites before I gave up entirely. There was no mascarpone (that I could taste), no savoiardi, barely any coffee.... It was a mildly caffeinated synthetic semi-stale cheesecake! Most emphatically NOT tiramisu. Fail... If this was a single occasion, that would be fine. But my friend got a chocolate cake, and that too seemed like something from a tesco's box. Honestly. I'm no pastry chef, yet I make better at home! Anyone can afford some real chocolate, surely! So Sarastro.... Go for the pasta, and most definitely AVOID DESSERT. With a cheaper main, a glass of wine and a dessert my bill came up to around \u00a320. A bit much for a plate of pasta, home wine and i'd-rather-eat-my-slippers dessert! My friend's was about the same, as she chose the 2-courses for \u00a315 (or was it \u00a313?) lunchtime special and had wine as well. Oh, and if you go, insist to be seated in one of the high alcoves that resemble opera balconies. It's warmer there, and the door does seem to have a nasty habit of being left ajar and the cold wind finding its way to whatever part of your anatomy is most exposed to it! And, most importantly, bring a camera!! This is a lovely place for pictures, with rich red and gold decor, and random theatrical paraphernalia scattered all over the walls.",

What you are paying for is the ambience, the experience of dining somewhere so different and quirky, and the entertainment (live opera on certain nights - it changes as to which night so check before you book). Service can be painfully slow. However, the starters and main courses are okay (as opposed to excellent as they used to be), desserts are not worth ordering - unless you go for the fresh fruit. Lamb is cooked well here, the pasta is okay. Worth a visit if just to get away from the 'same old' restaurant looking places.",

    "text": "Sarastros is an Opera inspired restaurant offering something different and quirky compared to your usual restaurants. The mass of foliage and shrubbery outside the restaurant gives a really exotic and extravagant first impression and when you get inside it's a feast for the eyes. There are drapes hanging everywhere, gold ceilings, trinkets, balconies that are beautifully decorated and carved to sit in. If you are going on a date or with your partner I would recommend requesting a private balcony as it creates such a magical and romantic eating experience. They have large balconies as well for bigger groups. I recently went to a friend's birthday meal and sitting up looking over this incredibly flamboyant restaurant is a really unique experience. The food however doesn't match up with the d\u00e9cor and atmosphere this restaurant offers. It certainly wasn't bad but when you compare the dishes to the surroundings there is little correlation-the food is quite basic, not full of flavours and scents as the restaurant is which is a bit of a shame because if this place had the whole package it would be a regular stop off of mine. Having said that I would definitely go back just to be able to see and experience the restaurant again. It is a definite must see!",

    "text": "We went to Sarastro last Friday: the local it's very impressive seen from the outside windows, or the entrance door: it is like a surrealistic mediterranean fantasy, an ideal place between Italy and Turkey with its lodges, carpets, golden decorations and lighs. Some opera's music enhance the atmosphere, and it looks very \"luxurious\". When you are inside and setted at your table, things change a bit, and you understand that the luxurious facade (there is a rolls royce always parked in front of the door) it's only a facade, like in a operetta theater. During our dinner a crappy orchestra (romanian i presume) started playing touristic songs begging for money from the customers...and you understand that Sarastro it is only a funny tourist trap. Dishes are on the average side: some sauces for starters, hummus, tzatziki, olive, and the main courses are not a big selection: chicken, lamb, roast duck, grilled salmon or vegetable pasta. Some customers on the lodges were drunk and so wine and tomatoes fell down to the downside tables (and people), and it was not so funny. But after all i think that Sarastro still is an experience you should do in London, better for a big happy crew of friends than for an elegant soir\u00e8e or a romantic dinner. When the opera airs play in the restaurant the atmosphere is much intriguing \u00a0than the romanian orchestra. Go there, enjoy the local, take some photos, drink some wine and be happy, but be prepared to pay for the atmosphere, not for food.",

The restaurant is a baroque fantasy crossed with a Prince's bedroom in the Palace of Versailles. Everything is gilded; strange, tiny balconies jut out above you, almost like cliff precipices, only these ones contain tables with diners. I was petrified that one would fall on top of me!Sarastro's is not the place where you go for memorable food. It is a place where wine and conversation flows, and everyone has a raucous and loud time. Don't think about coming here for a quiet meal. I come here for friends birthdays (they are great at catering for big groups) and this place is a safe bet for a Christmas party.",

    "text": "You will have gathered from the other reviewers that the interior is great, and that is the case. However, the time we had to wait for our food (when the restaurant was pretty empty) meant that out chief interest in the decor was whether or not we could gnaw it to stave off hunger. We called in pre-theatre , with over an hour and a half to eat in. We told the manager we were going to a show. But still, we had to wait nearly an hour for our starters to arrive, and another twenty after that for our main course to arrive, despite asking the waiter when it would arrive (\"Five ten minutes, OK\" yeah, right). As a result, we had to rush our food. Good job the food wasn't particularly special and deserving of attention, then, eh? Ordinary/OK-ish food. Stale bread. Nice olives to be fair. \u00a360 for two. 12.5% optional service charge? Best laugh I had all night.",

The decor inside and out is excellent, lavish, extreme, and definitely quirky, the layout amazing with a long room transformed into 2 layers of lavish and gilded theatrical boxes. The food was plenteous (or my fellow diners did not eat much?) and Turkish so it was tasty and enjoyable. All in all a great evening for enjoying wine, good conversation and plenty of music. Prices are not cheap, but I wasn't paying..",

From the name I thought that it was either Italian or Spanish.It is decorated in the theme, as tribute to the theatre, with great colours and masks and statues everywhere. The last time I ate here, I had the grilled Dover Sole in a special sauce, which was fantastic. Baring in mind where the restaurant is, you may think that it would be really expensive to dine here, well, it is, but not too bad. The starters are around \u00a34-6, which is decent, and the mains are around \u00a322 on average. It is a great place to dine and the waiters are brilliant. I haven't been for a while but for all the times I have been, there has been a brilliant, tall and bald waiter who just makes everyone laugh. He was born to do his job and has been working there for years. I would recommend this restaurant any day, to anybody, with great food, great location and a great layout, you will love it. Just to add, a 12.5% service charge will be added to your bill at the end.",

    "text": "Not sure how I managed to overlook this wonderful place - I guess I thought the whole of Soho is full of tourist traps. Sarastro is a family business and filled to the roof with decades of theater and opera props and quirky details (like the potholes that were filled with pennies as the owner determined this was cheaper than cement) The seating is cozy with balconies and little separ\u00e9es and booths. The music is naturally mostly from operas and makes for a \"demimonde atmosphere\" There are regular free shows with show tunes and arias at 8:30 pm and the staff seems to have a good time. Unfortunately, the food ranks behind the promising set-up. For being firmly in Mediterranean hands the food is pretty bland and uninspired, albeit reasonably priced. I was a bit underwhelmed by the fish dish and the stir fry but we had a lovely braised duck. I would happily give 5 stars if the would up their game there. Better stick to the starters, they were all lovely. They also keep the good tradition to serve a wonderful tomato paste, fresh olives and bread with the meal. Still, it is a brilliant place to go after theater for a drink or two with some excellent house wines and a setting that will blow away your visitors. If you want to sit in one of the balconies reservations are advisable (only four people or more!) PS: The bathrooms feature painted murals with orgy scenes in them that some might find offensive. Just take it with a wink and \"warn\" your guests before they go there. After all, this is theater land and not Disney land.",

    "text": "This place had so much potential, but this is a prime example of how a bad server can just destroy an experience. We made our reservation and were really looking forward to our dinner. Upon walking in, we were really excited about the decorations, and overall look of the restaurant. It is stunning to say the least. Very unique, vibrant, and colorful. We were seated immediately, even though we were about a half hour early for our reservation.There was live entertainment the night we were there, and while he was very friendly and we enjoyed him, our table was right near what turned out to be a very lively dance floor. As a side note, it would have been much appreciated to have been told that we were being seated by the dance floor, because once the entertainment started, we could no longer hear the others in our party, and we struggled to even get up and go to the restroom because the dance floor was so packed. We knew there would be a singer that evening, but had no idea that there would be a dance party and that we would be confined to our table just looking at one another.Then there was our very unpleasant server. She was curt, disinterested, and inattentive. We were at the restaurant for almost 2 hours, much longer than desired, and in that time we had our first order of drinks and water with our meal. We had water because we were never offered any additional drinks, and could not get her attention. And once we finished our first glass of water, we were never offered more, so we just sat there thirsty, trying to get the attention of one of the worst servers I have ever had. The food was good, definitely not even close to the best we had on our trip, and more expensive than any other place we dined at. One of the members of our party finally got up and wriggled through the dance floor to go ask somewhere for our bill. The bill was promptly brought to us by the gentleman she asked, not our server. We thought perhaps she just disliked us, but she was equally inattentive to the older couple seated next to us who seemingly got up and went and ordered more drinks with someone. So to sum up, the food was okay, our server was horrific, and the atmosphere was a cool aesthetic visually but very loud and not conducive to enjoying quite a pricey meal. This was by far the worst dining experience we had in our week in London. We will not be going back the next time we visit.",

The decor in here is fabulous, over the top, quirky and fun. You can sit in mezzanine booths that look over the restaurant we had a booth at the far end so we could see most of what was going on downstairs. We were not sure if our very sweet, but most incompetent waiter, was a replacement for the entertainment that we didn't get to experience on the night. He certainly provided laughter with some bizarre situations throughout the night. Unfortunately the food wasn't brilliant. It was ok and edible but somethings (fish) were a little over done and mine lacked flavour. However, this is a reasonably priced restaurant in theatreland and it's more interesting than your bog standard chain.",

As I looked closer at the props filling the restaurant, I was impressed that they were dust free. \u00a0For the shear number of things crammed into this restaurant, I thought they would be dust filled but no. \u00a0Good sign.We ordered from the set menu. \u00a0The starter is a mezze which you really have no choice with but there are a number of mains to select so not too restrictive as some set menus can be. \u00a0Service was prompt and polite/friendly.I will cut to the chase. \u00a0You don't really come here for the food. \u00a0This was..food. \u00a0Not terrible but nothing to review on. \u00a0The part that makes this restaurant is the entertainment. \u00a0A little old lady sat near us and brought us into her conversation (79.5 years old she said). \u00a0After a few minutes of polite conversation, she landed information on us of what her job was. \u00a0She was the Queens lookalike - fantastic. \u00a0As the singing began up Queenie got and was dancing with the singer. \u00a0National anthem played she \u00a0returned to her table giving us a wink and saying 'you didn't expect that did you' \u00a0Very right, we did not!!As the singing got into the flow, we found ourselves up and dancing with the other diners. \u00a0I even got a jig with the queen ;) \u00a0Then, if we couldn't get more strange, in come a bus load of RAF personnel clearly on a quick night out. \u00a0Up they get and join in the dancing (Queenie asks me to set her up with one of the young RAF men and I oblige - yes I got a strange look when I asked if he wouldn't mind dancing with the queen!). \u00a0They all congo out the restaurant onto the street and back in again..... WHAT???I get tourists up who were sat next to us to join in the dancing and this goes on until the restaurant closes and then and only then, do we leave.Strange, strange night. \u00a0I do believe it really happened and will be back to make sure that I didn't dream all those odd things put together for a great and memorable night!!!",

    "text": "Well where to start...at the beginning is best I guess. This is a restaurant which is like nothing I have ever experienced before and i use the word restaurant loosely!!From the outside it is covered with many plants, apparently it has won awards for its greenery. So you see the outside and think hey a bit quirky but as they always say its whats on the inside that counts and boy has it got some insides.So on entering you are struck by the very different layout, they have balcony seating and on this evening had a row of tables down the middle for a birthday celebration. Now the restaurant clearly has a link to the theatres in the area as many of the props which decorate it have come from theatre land. They have a good selection of cocktails and the food..well I don not think this is the place for a foodie. The food is ok and hits the spot but nothing special. The special thing is the atmosphere created by the live performers.They have live entertainment on different days, Monday is a string quartet, Wednesday is Raphaela Trio, Thursday is Colin Roy. We were there on \u00a0Thursday so \u00a0I cannot tell you about the other acts that reside there.Colin Roy is down as a singer of swing and Motown legends and he delivers on this. With a very good library of songs, all of which get you tapping your feet or swaying in your seat. Once we had done away with the food, which we had of the set menu so choices are limited but as I said earlier the food is not the priority (well for me it was not)There was an old dear sat near us who we had a chat with and before you knew it she was pulling out the little book which showed she was a Queen impersonator. And once the singing started she was up on the floor p.aying the part. All very good and unsuspecting.So as the evening went on the songs kept coming the RAF popped in for a quick drink and we kept on we kept dancing (well dancing is the technical term!!)The evening was so good we were there swaying away until it was time to leave. Had a great time here and will be back. If you are passing by this place pop in and book a table!!",

We didn't get to eat much because our friend didn't feel very well (before we ate), but the waiter brought food and drink to make her feel better before we ordered (which he did not charge for). We had some starters which were all SO DELICIOUS. We couldn't stay for mains but judging by the starters I feel it would taste equally amazing. \u00a0Would like to especially give a review to the waiter with the glasses who brought our sick friend some fresh lemon juice which ultimately made her feel better. The staff were all very accommodating and I had a very good time there. Would definitely go again!",

    "text": "From the moment I arrived to the garden exterior of the restaurant with a giant poster telling me that Colin Roy would be performing that night I knew I was in for a good time.The interior is like something from the lost orient. There are tables in the rafters and exotic art and trinkits everywhere. Try and book in advance to get one of the high tables.We got the two course set menu with mezzes and a main. The downside is I think it's a little over priced. The two courses comes to \u00a328.95 per person without drinks (and then there's a service charge added to your bill). However, the food itself was really good, the mezzes were delicious, the Cheese Borek in particular was great. The wine was nice... I should know I drank almost two bottles of it.But I think the evening was made when a guy in a white suit came out and announced that he was Colin Roy \"your entertainment for tonight\" and launched into a set of Motown and popular hits that wouldn't be out of place at a wedding in the 70s. He managed to prize people off tables to a makeshift dance floor. This may sound like your idea of hell but if you're sat at the top you're not likely to get picked on and it's hilarious to watch. Only one of our group was taken by the hand and led by Colin to the dance floor where he danced awkwardly by himself for a while before sheepishly returning. The highlight of the night is when Colin led a congo line of the majority of the restaurant outside and seemingly round the block whilst still singing Soca's \"Hot hot hot\".We ended up staying long after we'd finished our food, drinking far too much wine, just because we were enjoying ourselves too much.If you're looking for a fine dining experience or a reasonably priced meal this probably isn't the place for you. But the decor is special (right down to the erotic doodlings in the toilets), the food is tasty and I'm not sure what the entertainment is on the other nights but I'm pretty sure you'll be entertained. The waiters were a bit grumpy but I kind of found this endearing.I hope to be experiencing Mezzes feat.Colin Roy again very soon!",

Food and server were great during our meal, but as we finished dessert and waited for our coffee, the hostess approached and said they had a large party coming in, and could we \"please pay and leave in the next 5 minutes.\" Never have I had such an uncomfortable and rude encounter with restaurant staff, particularly having spent over $100 and not finished my meal. Our polite server asked us to move to another table, and our coffee was complimentary, but the hostess' lack of courtesy towards a paying customer would make me reconsider a return visit.",

    "text": "I found this place when out for a walk with my mum (she was curious as to what the place was with all the flowers and plants on outside), and I'm very glad that I did. Sarastro's is not your usual restaurant, with everything from the fantasy-land decoration, silk napkins, and the friendly Turkish staff (especially the owner) giving it a really authentic feeling. Both times I've been (once with my mum and two friends, and another time on a date) I went on the night they had a live string quartet and an opera singer, accompanied by two dancers who do their best to invite people up to dance (I was too shy to join them though!). It really is about the experience as much as it is about the food, though the food is equally fantastic. I had their three-course set menu (\u00a332.45) with the fabulously tender Lamb Anatolian (slow cooked lamb shank served with mixed vegetables and keskek, traditional Anatolian creamed wheat) as my main the first time I went, and it was an easy choice to have it again the next time I went (on my date). The restaurant really is perfect for anything from a date or an easy-going dinner with friends, as the mezze starters to share is perfect to try exotic foods together, and the vibe is very energetic in the restaurant. Expect to pay around \u00a390 for two if you're having wine and their set menu, though for a special occasion it's most definitely worth it. Although I haven't been to the restaurant when they haven't had live opera and dancers, I see no reason why you wouldn't book a table on that night, it really adds an awesome dimension to the dinner.",

Starter is meze style which was very nice and I had the lamb for main course which was also enjoyable. My friend had panna cotta for dessert but she didn't like it. So why the five stars I hear you say! The decor in the restaurant is quirky and interesting, with some risky art work in the toilets. The staff are good and there is entertainment . Colin Roy, started with Swing followed by Motown, he is a great singer and entertainer encouraging everyone to get up and dance. The night finishes with a few more recents tunes being played by the DJ, all in all a fabulous evening and I would recommend it for a great fun night out.",

    "text": "I have walked pass this place many times over the years. \u00a0Every time I passed, I looked in and thought 'must try this place', but until now, never had. It always struck me as great place for groups, as there is entertainment, whilst you dine. I was really excited when a group of 22 of us decided to give it a go for a leisurely Sunday lunch. The d\u00e9cor is really unusual, but that unusual, if you have visited any of the 'Little Bay' restaurants. In fact it looked very much like a 'Bigger Bay'. \u00a0It has loads of gold leaf, and rich velvets going on, with elevated boxes around for diners to sit. We were seated in such a box, which was a bit of a squeeze.Being such a large group, we decided to go with the fixed price set menu. It started with a Meze. This sharing platter consisted of Hummus, Cacik (Yoghurt with chopped cucumber and garlic), Kisir (Turkish style cous cous salad, Shakshouka \u00a0(Saut\u00e9ed aubergine, green peppers and onions in tomato sauce), Cheese Borek (Cheese filled puff pastries), Mushroom Borek (Mushroom filled puff pastries) and (Sucuk (Turkish style spicy beef slices with mixed peppers and tomato sauce). All were very pleasant. Actually the Shakshouka was very nice.For the main course I decided to go for the Beef Bourguignon. I was really disappointed with it. It had little flavour. If felt like I was laboring to eat it, rather than enjoying what I was eating. It was a huge let down for me.For desert I played safe and decided on Panna Cotta, which was described as home-made fruit compote and mixed berries. For mixed berries, read one raspberry and two blueberries. Again, it was nothing to write home about.Whilst we dined, we had string quartet, and opera singers to entertain us. They were fine. They played to the crowd with tunes and songs that people would recognize from TV adverts. It felt 'Now That's What I call Opera/Classical 60.All in all, I felt let down by my experience, and at \u00a360 for the set menu and three beers, found it expensive for what was offered. I kept thing how much cheaper the same sort of experience would have been at a Little Bay, and probably more fun too.",

Food is distinctly average and smacks of wedding preplate (especially the main course). What gives this the full 5 stars is the entertainment! I don't know if it's every night or just because it's the Valentine's time of year. They didn't mention it at time of booking. Enter stage left; professional karaoke crooner in white suit, armed with a microphone and a steely determination to find all the birthdays in the house and terrorise them. (it wasn't mine so I was safe!)I'm not sure what was worse; his song choices (drunk and sentimental Dad at the juke box), his schmaltz or his cheap backing tape.It was perfectly cringeworthy, so bad it was hilariously good. And an excellent date icebreaker, not to mention a distraction from the salmon, which was flavoursome but soggy, with overcooked potatoes and trimmings.I'd had no idea what the interior was like; I literally gasped when I stepped inside! Bachannalian and sumptuous theatre inspired decor. I wanted to dress up and feast, cavort about and drunk wine. (maybe they do private hire?!)They get very busy so you have to book. Check that they have someone singing when you do. Don't take people that don't have a sense of humour!",
