The Salami, Rocket and Parmesan was nice but the Goat Shoulder with Savoy Cabbage and Sumac Yogurt, though it sounded weird was fantastic. Nice intimate vibe inside in Covent Garden and some tasty pizza to match,",

I went here with some colleagues from work during a lunch break - what a nice spot. \u00a0Nestled into Neal's Yard inside Covent Garden, this is a great space to bring a small group.There are a bunch of pizzas to choose from (the classics all the way from black pudding or oxtaill to mushroom and ricotta). \u00a0The 20 quid whole pizza is more than enough for two people (or you can bring home!) or you can opt for couple slices at 4 quid each. \u00a0Though I ordered the \u00a0half Caprese pizza and half corn and chrizo, I was actually happier with my colleague's choice of plain ole marinara and salami at half and half.Service: Friendly and quick - they came over a few times to check on us & collect napkins - nice vibe!Food: Pizza in London is getting better and better. 3 years ago I would have been \u00a0blown away and so excited to finally have some sort of decent pizza but now with the likes of Pizza East and Rays cropping up - I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. I prefer more of a NY style pizza - and found the crust to be not so yummy and the bottom too soft and also burnt in some spaces. The sauce, though was quite yummy.If you're in the neighborhood, shopping or roaming around central - stop by for a relaxed slice or two but don't expect to have your socks totally blown off.",

After walking around and looking at all the tourist trap restaurants, we stumbled on Homeslice and immediately knew we'd found what we were looking for. I'm from New York and I've had some good pizza, but this was by far one of the best pies I've ever had. My friend and I ordered the 20 inch pie with half salami/rocket, half cauliflower cheese/auberjine/spinach. Both were amazing!Definitely my goto spot for when I'm craving wonderfully made thin crust pizza",

    "text": "Given we only had a few days in London, we were so impressed with the unbelievably incredible pizza that we went back for a second dinner there. This may be the best pizza I've ever had, and that includes all of NYC, Chicago, and Italy. The ingredients are of fantastic high quality, menu is direct and straightforward (food is slice, pizza, half&half from a menu of creative pizzas, drink is water at the table, red or white wine sold by the centimeter or a couple of beers). Service was great and we got the same awesome waitress both times.The pizzas are so big they're the size of the table, leaving sparse room for drinks and even plates (they ask you if you want plates or just eat off the wooded pizza service). We just ate off the wood directly, a little messy but part of the fun experience.Downsides: you'll wait quite a while for a seat, but while we were eating we saw people who knew they were going to wait for up to 2 hours happily standing in line. After eating the pizza, I can see why they'd wait like this. It's also packed, shoulder to shoulder with multiple parties sharing a table. It's also so loud inside it's hard to have a conversation. It won't matter much, it's that good. I wish this place had a branch here in the states!",

You can get half and half on a whole pizza which is 20 pounds or by the slice is 4. The wine we got was just a house red. Tasty for being a house wine. They give you 1.5 liters of wine and charge you for every glass you drink. There are 11 glasses in each bottle and we finished the bottle. The glasses are four pounds each so we spent 44 on wine. 64 total for 4 people in Covent garden area is not bad at all. I would recommend putting your name in and going to a nearby pub though because the wait is typically pretty long. Fabulous pizza and the weight staff was pretty friendly! I'll be going back next time I'm in London.",

I SAID...BRING ME THE HOMESLICE. \u00a0BRING IT NOW! NOW! NOW! ARRRRRRGGHHHH!",

Very satisfactory foodie experience. Their other pizzas are quite tasty and original, too. Everything washed down with a decent lager. Plus, very professional and warm service.

We tried the courgette and artichoke and the margherita pizza slices (\u00a34 each). The waiter suggested courgette and artichoke, and when you first hear the name you think they must be crazy. I wouldn't put courgette on my pizza, and I would never put artichoke on my pizza. Why the hell would I put courgette AND artichoke on my pizza? But seriously, it was amazing! Now, they were both delicious, but the margherita was one of the best pizzas I ever had. \u00a0That wood fired oven you pass by on your way in makes a difference because the crust was well baked and delightful. \u00a0They also season their pizzas really well and I think it was the seasoning that made the margherita stand out.The atmosphere is hipstery (trendy?, I don't know I'm old). The location is a great place as well in Neal's Yard. So if your a tourist, it's a great place to visit. The staff were welcoming and friendly, and willing to walk you through their crazy menu.

    "text": "Homeslice is one of those London places that I had been meaning to try out forever. It's right near my uni which is quite convenient, but it's in the center of super-crowded covent garden/neal's yard. This means that eating here takes a bit of planning and coordination. Either you must make an effort to show up at a slow time, or you should be prepared to queue...but fear not, it's worth it! I always remembered that this place existed at precisely the wrong moment--on an after-dinner walk, following a chinatown feast, on the way to class, running late from the bus, or after drinking on a weekend evening--when the place is so crowded it seemed futile to even try. So, a few weeks ago, after a few pints, when my friends and I were deciding what to have for a celebratory post-exam dinner, I had a lightbulb moment--I knew it was time for some pizza. The queue at this place was formidable on a weekday evening. It was clear that we would be waiting to sit-in so we decided to get a few pizzas to go and eat in a friend's flat, just around the corner. I am so happy that we did--as eating these pizzas in the relative private meant that fewer people witnessed me inhaling it in a decidedly ungraceful/unflattering way. Worth it. I am a big fan of this pizza. There were 6-8 of us and we split three pizzas--this gave us the chance to try almost every pizza on the menu, thanks to the option to order 1/2 and 1/2 pizzas. We devoured the pies and fought over the precious last slices and the delicious salty/savory crusts. The crust is thin and crunchy with a satisfying chew on the interior. Parts of the crust were a bit charred--if we had been sitting in, we might have sent it back...but we definitely ate it anyway with smiles on our faces. :P I was a huge fan of the goat shoulder and also the salami with rocket. Writing this review has made me crave pizza...hopefully I have some in the freezer. I am dying to go back to Homeslice to eat more yummy pizza.",

The pizza is great but it was the atmosphere of the restaurant that really made for a perfect night. \u00a0Set in the middle of Neal's yard, a collection of eclectic buildings and interesting shops with both outdoor and indoor seating line the street and set the scene for the quant pizza restaurant. Lights strung across both the inside and the outside create the perfect mood lighting and the \u00a0staff was extremely friendly.Now back to the pizza My boyfriend and I were in a rush so we ordered just by the slice. We didn't get too adventurous because they only had Margarita, Pepperoni and Courgette by the slice but they were incredible. The pizza crust is very thin and the toppings all very fresh. My favorite was the Pepperoni and my boyfriends was the Margarita. If I was to go back with more time I would order one of the others because the variety of toppings are endless. Basically, it's a must visit spot.",

I love the simplistic pricing and all the choices and combinations you can have for pizza.Me and my boyfriend were very hungry and decided to demolish one pizza between the two of us (which I personally think is impressive!) the 20\" pizza could probably feed 3 moderately hungry guests, especially if you wanted drinks etc.We ordered our pizza with half goat shoulder and kale and half classic margarita. It is a struggle for me to decide which one is better! The goat shoulder was very tender and flavourful. It tasted well balanced with kale leaves on the pizza. The tomato sauce on the margarita half tasted very fresh and slightly sweet. I do wish we had more basil on the margarita end though. Perhaps that is something we could request next time...The location is really cute, right inside neal's yard. Warning that this place can get very full quickly! And they don't take bookings. I suggest trying to get here either earlier or later than peak dining hours or trying a Sunday evening!",

It's filling in a carbolicious way but it has a ceiling as to how good it can really beHomeslice has a good reputation and I was able to join a little band of Yelpers yesterday to finally sample it. There was a nice smell pervading the small restaurant space in Neal's Yard when I arrived but as there's a no booking policy, our group faced a 45 minute wait on arrival. However, what was a bit off-putting was that my friend and I were given the hint twice to go away despite there being \u00a0more than enough room in the restaurant to wait. Then, no sooner had we sat down in a nearby coffeeshop when we were then summoned back as our table was ready.The small space is compact with stools and low tables but they have been clever with providing things like hooks for coats. Be prepared to share tables. The menu of pizza is up on the wall with old classics mixed with some innovative combos - all pizzas are \u00a320 and you can mix 2 flavours on one pizza. They have an innovative way of selling wine in a large bottle and you're charged by them measuring the amount remaining in the bottle. The music was too loud with conversation taking place with uncomfortable shouting across the tableBut the food, the food, I hear you cry. Well, I did like the toppings with the butternut, bacon, stichelton and smoked onion being my favourite combo. However, the base didn't impress me - it was soft, making it hard to cut with the blunt pizza cutter. The middle of the pizza was too floppy, making eating the pizza very messy as fillings kept falling off. The edge was too doughy and most of our group left our crusts. I like my pizza bases more crispySorry, Homeslice but I can't really add my glowing love for you",

The not being able to reserve a table although annoying is made up for by the fact you can put your mobile number down and go for a drink, as they call you. Generally speaking the time estimate they give you is normally accurate, my most recent visit we did end up waiting a little longer, the bonus of this though was finding a little restaurant Compagnie des Vins Surnaturels in Neal's Yard that let us just order wine so will definitely head there in future. I love the changing menu as it really allows for variation (in a small place) the 20 inch pizzas are more than adequate for 2/3 people, they do individual slices too (but the menu is a little smaller). The pizza itself is amazing, the bases are thin, the toppings are always fresh and hot and just generally delicious, the range of flavours and combinations always makes it more interesting and tasty.They have opened up 2 other restaurants now so I'm hoping that the Neal's Yard store becomes slightly less crowded, it's always a bit of a squeeze (worth it but having elbow room would be great too).",

We ordered a pizza to share just classic Margherita. We severely underestimated the size of this pizza. The look of shock on our faces when a pizza came out that was the size of the table! Challenge accepted! We tucked right in. The crust was amazing, perfectly thin and has a nice salty flavour to it. The tomato base was delicious and fresh and the mozzarella and basil were divine. We topped ours off with some chili oil. Yum yum! We somehow managed to finish the entire pizza and because the crust was so delicate and thin we didn't even feel sickly full. I will definitely be returning for more pizza! The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is the fact the tables were crammed together and I felt quite cramped. There wasn't even enough room for our drinks and pizza on the same table.",

Nothing fancy, just straight up comfort food.Homeslice Pizza delivers just that. I sauntered in on heatwave day 2015, and luckily were early enough to beat the flood of post-work eaters. We were seated pretty quickly (just 2 of us, though), and our order of a 20\" margherita was pretty fast. But that didn't mean it wasn't freshly made. It was delicious! Yes, it was enormous, but it is very thin, so the 20\" can easily feed two very hungry people. As others have mentioned, if you wanted a beer or another side/dessert/starter, sharing the big one between 3 would suffice.The crust was so tasty - soft, a bit crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. I wish it were a biiiiit thicker, but I think that's down to personal preference rather than what makes a generally good pizza crust. The sauce and basil leaves on ours were pretty good, and went well with the chilli oil on the table.Definitely will be back soon to try other toppings. At the moment, it's my 2nd favourite spot for a great Napoli-style pizza, so it's up there, for sure! Also, the name's pretty fun to say.See you soon, Homeslice!",

It is super rare that I could tolerate waiting 2 hours for dinner especially when it was already getting to be dinner time. Thankfully there's a nice wine bar nearby so after a few glasses, the time flew by and Homeslice called to say that our table was ready. We had a vegetarian in our party of 5 so we ordered 1 pizza of vegetarian options that 3 of us were going to share and then 1 pizza with meat options that 2 of us were going to share. Mine was 1/2 salami and Parmesan and 1/2 goat shoulder and sumac yogurt. Both were incredible- the salami one salty and so satisfying and the goat shoulder very unique and equally as delicious. I ended up having 5/8 of the whole pie and I have to say it was worth the 2 hour wait. Gorgeous ma\u00eetre d as well.",

And this would be the song: When the mooooon hits your eye like a biig pizza pie, it's amoooreee....I'm not a pizza person, but Homeslice is a yummy exception I am happy to make. Biting into a warm slice here is comforting and delicious at the same time. The pizzas are big and I really appreciate that you can order each half with separate toppings. I experimentally ordered soujok on one side and the salmon on the other. Surprisingly, the salmon was my favourite!With it's soft crust and saucy interior, Homeslice pizza reminds me of authentic pizza in Naples. You will definitely be eating this pizza messily and hopefully with a plentiful amount of tissues on hand. This won't be for people who only like the crispy neat pizzas that you find anywhere but Italy, but if you are flexible about how you like your crust, I highly recommend this pizza. The restaurant itself is small, dark and cozy, and tucked away in Neal's Yard, not far from Leicester Square. It is quite busy and you may have to wait for a table. We didn't wait too long since it was a weekday and since there were 5 of us, we got our own table. The menu is written on the wall and there are some cool pieces of art on the walls to add atmosphere.I liked it so much I am already in need of another visit to try some more flavours. And what flavours! I love the unusual and yummy topping combinations they offer, which I have not seen anywhere else yet, in or out of Italy. I appreciate that they offer the choice of flavours with tomato sauce and others with white sauce.",

After reading all the great reviews and waiting 45 minutes for the table (relatively warm Saturday around 2 PM) I was hoping for a large portion of delicious pizza. Well, I left the restaurant absolutely delighted. The dough, which tends to be my benchmark was a perfect balance between crunchy and soft, with a tinge of saltiness. I like large portions and the 50cm pizza was perfect for me, especially since I was able to get it in split style - half salami-rocket-parmesan on tomato sauce and half goat shoulder-savoy cabbage-sumac yoghurt. The salami was a perfect classic while the second half was quite unusual and maybe if I went again I would have chosen full salami, not sure. I am not a pizza afficionado extraordinaire, but I do pay attention to quality and I found bucketloads of it in Homeslice. Add to that a wonderful location and you have a receipe for a wonderful afternoon.",

For flavourful, amazing pizza, there is just no place better.They bring out gigantic 20\" pizzas and hand you a pizza cutter, at which point everyone gets stuck in! At 20 pounds a pizza I think it's very reasonable.I especially like the Corn, Chorizo, & Coriander Pizza. I'm also a huge fan of their Cauliflower Cheese Pizza (it's got some sort of venison sausage on it as well), and the Lamb Shoulder, Watercress, Tomato, Red-Wine-Soaked Goat Cheese. Pro tip: This place gets incredibly packed. Ideally, you should only come with one other person, thus minimizing your wait time. Even if there's only 2 of you, be prepared to wait around 20 minutes on a weeknight, and 45 on a weekend. Luckily, Neal's Yard is a really cool area and there are a lot of shops/pubs to explore nearby while you wait.",

    "text": "I'm probably in the minority when I say I really don't enjoy pizza. I am very very very skeptical when people recommend me pizza places because I always feel like they don't match up to the best pizza I've ever had, which was in Copenhagen surprisingly but that's not important. I'm always chasing that perfect crunch, the right balance of toppings and crust, and I feel like most pizza places I've tried have always been a bit off. Homeslice was everything and probably even more? The flavors were amazing and even the ones I was a bit uncomfortable with (pig cheeks?), I found that it was still enjoyable. The location in Neal's yard is very small and cozy, and definitely a popular choice for dinner so if you plan on coming in for dinner, I recommend coming in a bit earlier than usual to avoid up to an hour of queuing. The price for individual slices are definitely a bit pricier so I recommend getting a whole pizza and splitting it with friends (only \u00a320)! Overall, I highly highly recommend this place for anyone who loves thin crust pizza and even those who are skeptics like myself!",

I also love that they are different by serving the pizza, and also the wine, in over-size. You don't order by glass but will have a 2-litre bottle on the table which will be measured at the end. Possibly dangerous but above all just fun.Unfortunately the deliciousness of Homeslice Pizza is not a secret so you will have to queue if you want a table. If possible, go before dinner time and it will be less crowded.",

After a somewhat boring hour of listening to a not so interesting professor she asked me whether I like pizza. Duh. Who does not like a good pizza? \"We ought to go to Neal's Yard\" she said. \"You will love it.\" So we walked.This was my first of frequent visits. My first ever slice was as she predicted loved and I took my self appointed task of introducing the place to numerous friends very seriously. After a geocache adventure we ended up in Homeslice and I converted two friends. After another mystery, namely the core exam of my degree, we had to celebrate our survival with three pizzas and when my siblings visited me in lovely London I knew where to go as well. Homeslice has never disappointed me. I particularly like the goat's shoulder and savoy cabbage pizza, but would recommend any really. I like the cosy setup of the restaurant. Simple wooden tables and a good view on the burning wood oven. This is a true gem in the middle of the crowded West End.",

The waitresses were rude at best, but worst of all they gave us 30 minutes to eat. Yes, 30 minutes, and they did not let know it before. We were still finishing our pizza and they already asked if we wanted the bill as they had to give the table away.

Its location in Neal's Yard is really quaint and nice, but it also means the restaurant is small and you might be sharing half of a table with another group. The menu starts off with your basics like margherita pizza and toppings like parmesan, but it goes from 0 to 100 real quick after that. The goat shoulder, cabbage, and yogurt dressing pizza sounded the best to me, so we split that and a margherita (half and half) in case the goat shoulder turned out to give us the cold shoulder.The ginormous 20 inch pizza came out (cut your own), and just by looking at it, you could tell the goat shoulder side was going to be better than the plain side. It was. Some of the best flavors I've had on a pizza came from that combination. The yogurt dressing is sweet and the pizza is salty and you have some protein and some vegetables--it was really quite good. The margherita was nothing to write home about. Average at best.Our waitress was pleasant and came to check on us once. Water was provided in a huge bottle for free which was a nice touch.I hope to be back next time I'm in London. Delicious.",

Then the other half with Salami, rocket and parmesan.The Goat Shoulder and savoy cabbage was nice in flavour but although it was drizzle with summac yoghurt, I thought it was on the dry side compared to the tomato base pizza.\u00a0Whereas the salami, rocket and parmesan pizza was the complete opposite being tomato base. The tomato sauce was still moist which meant the pizza was less dry to eat. The two toppings made a good combination as 50/50.",

It is a colorful and enchanting little court yard just up the road from Covent Garden filled with a few other restaurants and little shops. When I came here, there was a two hour wait time for a table. This place gets filled up quick so if you're planning on going with a group, make sure you have a reservation or go super early. Thankfully, for those eager to try it out they do offer take away by the slice. Just be aware that they only offer three selections for takeaway - margherita, salami, and one with artichokes - and they charge 4\u00a3 per slice which is a bit ridiculous but the portions are huge. I ordered the margherita, which was really savory and delicious and I ate it just outside the restaurant since there are benches all around the courtyard. I wasn't full after this meal but if you are doing some exploring in this neighborhood and don't feel like sitting down for a long meal, it is a great place to grab a satisfying bite to eat and continue on with your adventueres!",

You can split the toppings if you want, which allows for trying out different toppings at once. Also should you want just a slice you can from their regular pizzas. However at \u00a34 a slice the value isnt great. The pizzas are \u00a320 each, which between 3/4 is totally excellent value, because:THE PIZZAS ARE BLOODY AMAZING!!!!!!Oh my word, garlicy, cripsy and soft, with generous toppings, exotic but balanced. I'm salivating just thinking about this place.Every time i've been its been rammed, regardless of which day of the night it is, so book ahead.

As we're all aware, London severely lacks delicious takeaway \"pizza by the slice\" places....much to the chagrin of all the expat residents. You can get an entire pizza anywhere, but dear lord, what if I just want a quick slice to takeaway?! Sure, there are a few places peppered around, most notably in Dalston...but nowhere central that pops to mind. But, with Homeslice, all that has changed. I'm sure, at some point, I'll be patient enough to sit down and try one of their fancier, sit-down pizzas, but for now, I am stoked just to grab a delicious piece of pepperoni and and be on my way.",

The last-minute actuality: Nava, Adam and I went for cocktails nearby until the other half was free and the four of us went to get some pizza. There were four of us, so no reservations, but they kindly took my phone number to call us when our table was ready.The only downside is the place is small. The tables are small. There were people spilling over into our area when we first sat down, but once they left we had quite a bit more room.They keep is super simple. \u00a320 a pie which you can order half-and-half if you like. They also do a few of their pizzas by the slice (but those were the least interesting ones in my opinion). The booze is super simple as well. They have prosecco on tap. They have a house red and a house white. They whip out unlabelled magnums of wine with glasses. They measure how much you drink, and if you drink the whole bottle, it's \u00a344. (And for a magnum! That's only \u00a322 a bottle!) The white and red were also way better than expected for house wines (and better than the prosecco). They also do a couple of beers.But their pizzas SHINE and they're HUGE! We split the bone marrow (YES they do a bone marrow pizza) and the jamon, blue cheese and walnut. It's hard to decide which was better (but I do love blue cheese and walnut on a pizza). The crust is super thin and flatbready and DELICIOUS. After a couple bites I was in absolute heaven. Of course there were four of us, so two slices each wasn't quite enough, so we ordered a second pie. Because for \u00a320, why not? Our second pie was salami and rocket and oxtail and horseradish. Both were also really tasty, though I think preferred the first one.After finishing our red and having four glasses of white, we all left satisfied.

    "text": "I took my friend to Homeslice based on recommendations from Yelp and she loved it so much she's taken loads of friends since! And I love it as well, though I've only been one other time, where I've since gotten to try loads of other flavours and I have to say this is the best pizza I've had in London. I do have issues with 2 things: the floppyness of the pizza, and the dullness of the pizza cutters they give you. If you really dislike floppy pizza, you really won't want to go here, but I can deal with it if the flavours are good.The first time I came here was at lunchtime and we were seated immediately, had really good service throughout the meal, and ended up having loads of leftovers. It's definitely worth it though to get the full pizza between 2 people, because if you get a better range of toppings and if you're going to buy 2 slices at \u00a34 each per person, might as well pay the extra 2 quid for 2 more slices - value for money!On the second time we were a group of 4 so got to try 4 different flavours - I was in love with each one though I probably particularly recommend the lamb shank and goat cheese. The house red wine was really nice, though be careful because they'll give you this huge bottle of red wine that they measure how much you've drank, and if you drink that whole bottle it's \u00a344! Which, well, we did. Stuffed to the brim with delicious pizza, it was a merry night indeed.",

I must admit, upon entering the restaurant, I was a little skeptical (as I glimpsed paper plates being used). Definitely worth saying here - don't judge a book by its cover! The pizza was incredible! We ordered a 20\" half and half (one half:chorizo, coriander and corn, second half: ricotta, mushroom and chilli) and I couldn't help but gasp in awe when it hovered above our heads and served to our table. The aroma that filled the air...only goodness!! It was perfectly cooked in their stone bake oven (thin crust, perfect amount of toppings and of course a generous portion). They also provided us with a pizza cutter (which always a plus in my books), which provided me with great entertainment as I watched my friends attempting to equally divide this gigantic creation!!",

    "text": "We came here on a Sunday evening - had to wait a bit for a table but it was worth it. We ordered half of the lamb shoulder and half of the scallops pizza. The dough is really thin (you almost have no choice but to crease it) and kind of has the same taste and consistency as fresh naan. The crust is a bit thick and on the chewier side, but good for sopping up all the sauce/toppings that will fall off when you try to eat these huge slices! It's also kind of cool that they don't pre-slice the pizza, so you can cut it into as many slices as you want. The pizzas look big but since they're so thin, two people can easily devour one (or maybe we're just gluttons).4/5 stars because it is on the pricier side, and the thin-ness of the dough doesn't allow it to hold many toppings, so with each slice you really only get two or three bites of the full flavor profile.",

    "text": "Well. I really do not understand the 5-star rating this place is holding. I really, really, really don't.First, let me cover the things I did like:- Communal seating seems to work really well and feels very cozy. (tables for two also available)- Service was very good.- Drinks were quick and perfect (beer or Prosecco).- Location is perfect, on a quiet street moments from ridiculously good shopping.- Has a hipster cool vibe that I like.Now, the reason Homeslice does not deserve 5 stars (at least from me):- The pizza. Seriously, the crust was rubbery, chewy and only crispy on the edges.- The bottom of the crust was burnt in too many places. I like a little woodfire char, but this was too much.- The edge/crust was stupid-salty.- No cutlery. None.- With no silverware, rubbery crust and lots of sauce, guess what happens? Ingredients and sauce everywhere. A friggin' mess.- On the pepper pizza, the peppers still had their stems attached. Again, no cutlery... am I supposed to eat the stem? No, so I pick it off with my hands? More mess.- The oxtail was... just chewy and gross. Not great.- The pizza cutter didn't cut. At all. My husband had to stand up to put enough pressure on the pie to cut a piece off. Dull pizza slicers are a downer.Rubbery-ish, burnt, picked-at, ripped pieces of pizza, all over my hands and face. Does that sound good to you?I really wanted this to be it. My States-style pizza place that I would love. But it isn't. It has the right attitude and tons of potential, but not the right execution. At least not last Saturday. :(",

All were good but none were great. Too little sauce on some. Too little cheese on others. Most of the toppings seemed to be just tossed onto a regular slice that was warned up for a minute or two. Perhaps it's best when you order a whole pizza and it's made to order. Ambiance is nice as was the service but this place wouldn't be so highly rated in the states. Not on par with places like Roberta's in NY or Cambridge 1 in Boston though the style is similar. Highlight: chili oil which I felt added some much needed flavor to all of the slices.",

    "text": "Yum.Having prepared for my visit to Homeslice by reading the Yelp reviews, my husband and I arrived around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon with a pizza cutter and two forks in hand. We were seated promptly and as I looked around the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice that the seating was not at all what had been described in the reviews I read.Seating:Given the reviews, I thought the seating at Homeslice was going to resemble Wagamama. Not the case. Not even close. There are only TWO, count them, TWO large tables which can seat 8-10 people, depending on if someone sits at the \"heads\" of the table. The rest of the tables (meaning the vast majority) are two-top tables along with two booths which can uncomfortably seat four people. The big problem with the two-top tables is that they are pushed together to form four-top tables. This works if you are in a party of 3 or 4 people but it gets a tad bit uncomfortable when you are in a party of two people and then two random people are seated right next to you with no space between your table and theirs. You essentially end up with two couples at a four-top table. I got over the seating situation as soon as I started eating pizza and you will too.Eating utensils:I am happy to report that pizza cutters now accompany each 20 inch pizza (\u00a320 regardless of the kind of pizza you select). No more strangely shaped knives or butter knives or even cheap plastic steak knives. You can now enjoy your pizza, sliced to your liking with the pizza cutter provided to you. I was happy to see the pizza cutter because it meant that I didn't have to pull mine out of my handbag.I am not happy to report that there are still no forks at Homeslice. I agree with previous reviews that the pizza can get messy and a fork would be helpful, if not required. The crust is very thin and if you order a pizza with heavy toppings (e.g. caprese), the crust simply cannot support the weight of the toppings. Let's call this \"pizza subsidence.\" We encountered pizza subsidence with the caprese half of our pizza - the chopped tomatoes (very delicious, by the way) fell off the slice of pizza when I picked it up. What's a girl to do when the toppings fall off her slice of pizza? She pulls out the fork from her handbag and eats the toppings off her paper plate with her fork, that's what she does.As a side note, I overheard the customer next to me ask her partner, \"I wonder where she got that fork.\" That's right, at least one customer was envious of my fork.Pizza toppings/variety:There are no starters or desserts at Homeslice. Just pizza, beer, wine, and fizzy drinks. The menu appears to change daily and is scribbled on a chalkboard near the entrance. A 20\" pizza is more than enough for two people though my husband and I plowed through the entire thing for the sole reason of it being that delicious.Drinks:A bottle of tap water was delivered to our table immediately upon being seated. This alone be grounds for awarding Homeslice five stars. No more trying to flag down a server for more water or even to ask for a glass of water. It's just there, ready for you to drink and refill you glass, taking pressure off the serving staff and making you a happy and hydrated customer.Wine is served based on your consumption meaning if you want to drink wine, they will deliver a massive 1.75 liter of wine to your table and you will pour your own glasses. When you are ready for your check, the server will bring a ruler over to your table and measure the remaining about of wine, tell you how many glasses you consumed (I suppose you could dispute this but our measurement was spot on) and then the server will bring your bill. Serving wine like this is once again a brilliant move by the people of Homeslice. No more flagging down a server for another glass of wine - just pour it at your leisure and get drunk while enjoying some of the best pizza your taste buds will ever encounter. \u00a0My only beef about the wine was that I was the only one drinking wine and felt a bit like I had a drinking problem given a 1.75 liter of wine was put in front of me. I mean, if only one customer is drinking wine, a smaller bottle should probably be delivered to the table but then again, it could be a marketing ploy to get other customers in that party to also drink wine (which happened to us as my husband poured himself a couple of glasses even though he didn't order wine).Tap beer is served in small and large sizes. Not sure on the \"brand\" of beer but it looked like a lager and beer drinking customers were smiling and laughing, so common sense tells me that the beer didn't taste terrible.Pizza was excellent (half salami, half caprese) and the service was also excellent which is something I think I've said four times since moving to London over two years ago. Take your tastebuds our for a treat at Homeslice BUT remember to bring a fork.",

This, however, is truly delectable pizza with quality ingredients. The dough is perfect. I wish I knew the man behind this place but I suspect it's the guy who stands around and tells people what to do and sometimes welcomes folks when they come. Anyway, kudos to that guy and to the pizzaiolos and Neil's Yard and the whole operation. I dare say it's my new spot. Love going at off times and trying two or three different types while enjoying a craft beer. So far, I've had Anchor, Beavertown, and Partizan. Can't really beat that combo. Only downside is because of its central London by the slice monopoly, it charges \u00a34 for a slice. But it's a great slice. Thank you, Homeslice.",

Its a small place that serves wood fire oven pizzas and has very unique combinations for the pizzas.We, a group of 4 got the oxtail and watercress pizza, and the chorizo, corn and coriander, both of which were really delicious.The servers were nice and friendly and pizza was quick. Although the it is a bit busy and the tables are a bit small, overall highly recommend it for the pizzas. Would definitely come back next time in London.",

I would fly out to London from California just to eat their salami slice in the freezing cold.... I did just that! It was a busy night so I took my slice togo. By togo, I mean outside the front door and on the tables no one was sitting on. This was my first meal in London. I actually stumbled upon this hidden gem in the alley after striking out at another restaurant I had my stomach set on.It was busy for a Thursday night but the place isn't too specious either. They only offer a few pizzas by the slice. I tried the mushroom slice and salami. I really wanted to try the ox tail but a whole pizza would have been too much for two.I really hope my next trip back to London it will be as good as the first! And it wasn't just super amazing because I was starving from a 15 hour plane ride.",

If you are going in a group, I recommend ordering the whole pizza because you can still order half and half of a pizza. i.e. two types on one pizza. The slides are HUGE but also very thin. Not a good place for you if you're a thick crust pizza lover. We got the anchovy, venison, mushroom, and sausage pizza. The venison pizza has GOT to be my favorite. It was so flavorful I just wanted to devour the whole half. The pizzas are a little on the salty side, so drink up on that water. If I were to visit London again, I NEED to go back to this place.",

You can't really go wrong with massive bottles of wine and 20\"pizzas.Food and Drink: 20\" Pizza and the menu changes all the time. Between the 3 of us, we ordered one half/half pizza and it was enough. The pizza was half salami, and half mushroom/rocket. The pizza itself is very thin and drenched in tomato sauce so the pizza doesn't hold it's shape well, and eating it can get really messy. But it tasted amazing. For drinks, you get a choice of red or white (which comes in a massive bottle). You can drink however much you want and they'll just measure what you had in the end and you pay for that bit. To give you an idea, it's a 2L bottle and the waiter said it would cost around \u00a344 to finish it all. Everything Else: The restaurant is a causal pizzeria where you can bring your family and friends. Also note that this place is particularly busy so it does get really loud. This doesn't diminish the excellent service that we had. I would come back again!",

The 1st time I stopped here on a Sunday evening around 3 pm and the line was out of the door with crowds milling about. I ran away.Went back at what I thought was an odd time (Monday afternoon 2 pm) and it was still packed but I managed to get a small spot to sit in after a 10 minute wait. The service was fast and efficient and since I was alone I chose one of the pizza \u00a0slices. Delicious slices (4 GBP) - you have to choose from 3 options if you're getting the slice - the Margerita, the lamb shoulder or courgette and artichoke. I chose the last one was I love artichokes and more people should be using them in their food. I was super hungry so didn't manage to get a picture, but it was really wholesome, light and delicious. The crust was thin & salty and I dipped mine in the chili oil kept on the table and savored every bite. Definitely go and try some pizza if you get a chance - it's excellent.",

The other great thing about this place is the wine. They come in these huge green bottles and pay for what you drink. This can be dangerous when with a group of friends! Although Neal's Yard is a great location, it doesn't take bookings and the line/queue can get long. So either order a slice to go or you can book ahead at one of their other locations.",

The heat of the coal fire pizza oven blasts your face as you push open the door and the music blasts into your ears. You have two ordering options a selection of unique pizza's by the slice or a 20 inch pizza you may choose to order half and half. Our party opted for a 20inch and chose two pizzas to split down the middle. We had the Aborigine and Cauliflower and the Salami and rocket choosing from the two a favorite is an impossibility. \u00a0The crust is thin and crisp yet also soft and doughy almost like a naan, the unique blend of flavors is perfection on all accounts. Having only sampled the two we had I can not speak to the full menu however from what I did sample I'm certain you can't go wrong here.",

They were also very attentive when it came to making sure we had plenty of water and napkins throughout our meal, despite how busy everything was. The most inconvenient part of our visit was how tight the space was.

We wanted a vegetarian pizza. \u00a0We ordered a twofer - half of the pizza was the Mushroom, Ricotta and Pumpkin Seed pizza while the other half had Aubergine (Eggplant in the USA), Cauliflower and Harissa.I liked the Mushroom Pizza more but the Aubergine Pizza was also excellent.Excellent Pizzas, thin wood fired crusts, great fresh ingredients.We bought Salads and Apple Cider from the nearby M& S to complete the meal.",

    "text": "Saw the reviews and just had to try this place. Restaurant is not that big but can sit quite a few diners, which means the tables have to be shared. We waited 15 mins to sit but we went on a Sunday and arrived at the resto at 16:00. Menu has limited choices, but I believe that when the menu is small, the restaurant specialises on the quality of the product and taste. We ordered the half and half pizza - half salami, parmesan cheese & rocket leaves and the other half is mushroom, ricotta, pumpkin seeds & chilli flakes. Their pizza is enormous (thank goodness we were starving!). Good for two people to share. Both sides were good but I enjoyed the mushroom side much more. And because of the size of the pizza, the dough in the middle is not as crispy as I would like it to be. Apart from that, think it's a pretty good pizza place overall. Although not as mind blowing as I thought it would be.",

Not many places in the city you can get a full sit-down meal for \u00a37 and it was some of the best pizza I've tried anywhere! We ordered two for a group of six - the chorizo and corn (which was surprisingly good) and another one with sausage and parmesan. Would recommend both! \u00a0The menu is small with six pizza options so it's easy to choose.The service was also great - our waitress was very chatty and took the time to have a conversation with our group given we were from out of town. As for the restaurant itself, the atmosphere was pretty casual yet pretty lively with good music and an open kitchen. There's plenty of tables but I'm sure it gets packed during peak hours. Overall a great place for dinner, especially for young people on a budget that would still like a full meal in a nice setting!",

I love that you can split the pizza down the middle and get two different styles of pizza, so you don't have to settle on something you might not like when sharing with someone.My boyfriend and I got the Wild Venison w/ Onion, Kale and Dukkah on half and Mushroom, Pumpkin Seed and Chili (No Ricotta) on the other half. It had to have been one of the biggest pizzas I have ever witnessed, so I was quite in shock when it came out. I ate a lot more than I thought I could, I think because it was thinner crust and not greasy at all. I left feeling satisfied and full, rather than overly stuffed. Also, this restaurant is in a cute little area called Neal's Yard, which was so colorful and picturesque.",

    "text": "While meandering through Neil's Yard we saw Homeslice and were intrigued. Could a couple from New York (New Jersey technically) who have also traveled to Naples and had multiple delicious pizzas in their life fined a decent slice in London? Sound pretentious don't I. Well let me tell you the answer is a resounding yes!We arrived around 20.30 on a Sunday night and had about a 8 minute wait for a table. The place was hopping. The menu is vary straight forward...pies are one size, you can get certain combinations on a 1/2 and 1/2 and some come by the slice. We opted for half MUSHROOM, RICOTTA, PUMPKIN SEED & CHILI and half PROVISIONS' 4 CHEESE, JALAPE\u00d1O SALSA & RYE CRUMB. The pie came out in no time and was amazing. The crust was of a perfect thickness to support all the toppings when you lifted it and had just the right amount of char on it from the oven. The base \"sauce\" on this was garlic oil which provided just the right balance to all the toppings. The earthiness of the various mushrooms with the slight crunch of the pumpkin seed and touch of chili was a great compliment to the richness of the 4 cheeses and salsa which was not a burning hot one so no worries there. The rye crumb was nice, they somewhat mimicked bacon bits, but for me were not needed.We were only two people and when the pie came (they leave it on the peel and you serve yourself right from that) it literally took up the entire table. These are huge pies but despite that I know I could have had more. That's not a critique on them, it's more about my insatiable appetite for good pizza. This place is a must stop for any pizza lover and my personal goal is now to try every combination they can possibly serve. I love this place!",

They offer pizzas by the slice or whole pizzas. They also have an option where you can put two different types of pizza on the same pizza. We decided on getting pizzas by the slice. We both ordered a slice of margherita and a slice or proscuitto, parmesean, and arugula. The slices came out fairly quickly; everything cooks fast in a super hot oven. The pizza was delicious and very filling. The slices are big and two filled us both up. Crust was perfect and good balance of sauce and toppings. Homeslice is cozy with a mix of communal tables and separate tables as well. Service is good; they were busy but they moved fast and made sure we had what we needed.",

This pizza is very floppy and about the size of a NY pizza so you have to eat it like one too - folded in half. It was perfectly salted with the cheese underneath the sauce. I saw a few people opt for several slices with different topping than go for one whole 20\" pizza. I may have done that, too if I was hungry enough. It wasn't too crowded when we dropped by but this could have been because it was in between lunch and dinner time. To avoid lengthy queues you might want to do the same.",

The tomatoes and basil did their job, but it was really the last few bites at the end (when the crust became a factor) that really brought me back into positive territory with this slice.With all the amazing pizza back home, it's hard to say I'd seek this out on a trip to London, but it's good nonetheless.",

The pizza was huge (20\") but we ended up finishing the whole thing because it was so good! The combination of toppings are pretty unique and delicious! I can taste the quality of the ingredients used and they were generous with it too. The pizza crust is bubbly and thin. It's not exactly like a New York thin crust but I'm still a fan. I'd definitely come back to try all the other ones!",

It says it all when locals and tourists alike are waiting in line because the entire eatery is packed with pizza lovers!They have simple and trendy pizza options, ranging from a classic Margherita Pizza to the more specialty toppings like Lamb and Cabbage Pizza.These were actually the two pizzas we chose to indulge our pizza cravings with. The pizza dough was truly amazing! It had that chewy texture, ultra thin, and perfect. The only thing that I did not enjoy was how little of the toppings they put on the pizza, but I know it's because the pizza itself was too thin to put anymore toppings on them for it to be handled.For the price (18~20\u00a3 // $24-$27) a pie, it was not a fair price. However, because it is in a prime location, with such great pizza dough, I'm sure it's fair in that sense.The workers are super friendly, and attentive! They hustle really hard! Had an amazing time.On a side note, the outdoor seating is at a first sit first serve basis. So sit as soon as you see someone leaving. Cheers!",

My first friend in London (who's taste I now question) said these exact words \"This is the best pizza London has to offer! Even better than American pizza and a close second to Italy\". Maybe it was the beers that were talking when she told me this or my HIGH expectations, but these pizzas are only good because of the creative flavors and large size (one pizza can serve 3 people). But my biggest reservation of Homeslice is the sub par service, the lack of sauce, and inconsistency of pizzas. The first time I came, I ordered the corn and chorizo and the brisket pizza and it was amazing! It was also cool that you could do half and half on their pizzas. Second and third time around, these were the shittiest pizzas. Barely any sauce and lack of flavor. To be safe, I would stick with their mushroom or rocket pizza (which are very reliable!). Also, the queue is at least 1 hour during dinner time and there is no seating to wait. Yelper's Note: Me and this friend are no longer friends. Not because of this pizza choice, but because they cannot hold their liquor and probably thought this place was amazing because she always comes here drunk.",

We put our name in and hung out in Neal's Yard for nearly 45 minutes before we realized we could've just ordered slices to go!After realizing this, we went back to the hostess and ordered four pizza slices for take away. We waited maybe another 10-15 minutes and then was finally given our pizza. We both got the same thing, a slice of margherita and a slice of salami, rocket and Parmesan. We then ate at the benches in Neal's Yard. The margherita was pretty good! I really enjoyed the dough, it was tasty. The sauce was alright and there could've been WAY more cheese. The salami was good too but it was spicy! I couldn't really separate the flavors either between the salami, rocket or Parmesan. My favorite was the margherita but I won't really be rushing back here. It was honestly only OK pizza.",

There is a line to order pizza, but most are getting it to take away and return to work or eat in the public courtyard! We ordered most of the available slice options- they have a more extensive menu but only four options are available by the slice. We had margherita, salami topped with rocket and Parmesan and mushroom slice! The crust was PERFECT- I was very impressed. Honestly our salami pizza was a bit cold but the flavor was great, the fresh Parmesan was plentiful on this pizza. The margherita was not my favorite, but it wasn't terrible- if you typically like the simple slices, you'll like it! Mushroom- also delicious! We finished some sodas and ended up ordering three slices of salami as we were still a bit hungry! These slices were FRESH, so they were hot and steamy and they were delicious! I would definitely recommend stopping here, we almost got this again because it was so good, kind of wish we did!",

Arrived at about 5:15 pm on Saturday, and the wait was 1:20. Took our names and told us to return around 6:10., since I didn't have a local cell to give.Returned about 6:15 and it took about 5 minutes to be seated.Small space with picnic type tables. The menu is on the blackboard and it's a 20 inch pizza for 20 pounds. The pizza is thin like a crepe with a crust and pizza ingredients. It's really delicious.It's really still good when it gets cold. Can't eat a 20 inch pizza too quick. I'd recommend trying this place. It's really for the under 30 crowd in my opinion.

Also it's a rather small place so there is often a wait outside, so come during non-peak times! The second time we came it was around 2:00 on a Friday so we had to wait for around 25 minutes, but oh was it worth it. Oxtail was again my favorite, but we also tried the salami and it was delicious. If you have a craving for pizza, this is the place!",

    "text": "Around the same time when legendary Pizza Pilgrims opened their first permanent restaurant in Soho, not far away over in Covent Garden, another highly praised mobile pizza business went permanent: Homeslice. I had my first Homeslice Pizza back in the days, when Qype was still Qype and they did a great summer party at a place in Brick Lane. Besides Big Apple Hot Dogs and other traders I cannot remember, Homeslice had a stall and were giving out pizza in quantities. They had a very busy evening, and if you ever tasted a Homeslice pizza, you know why! Sadly, I rarely had the chance to enjoy their pizza ever after \u00a0until now. As soon as I heard about the new shop, I decided to head down to Covent Garden to check out their restaurant. It is tucked away from the busy crowds and has quite a few places. It feels more informal and social than many other places. The menu of Homeslice Pizza is somewhat limited. No starters, no desserts, just pizza. Huge pizzas or pizza by the slice. Especially pizza by the slice is a great offering that you do not find at most pizzerias. If you are not too hungry or want to mix a little bit, this is perhaps the best idea since sliced bread. I had the simple margherita and can fully recommend it. The dough is very thin, flexible, yet still crispy, the toppings are tasty and the whole thing is one of the best pizzas you can get. Homeslice Pizza. Check it our yourself.",

I was waiting for the rest of my party to arrive before they seated me and the man was very welcoming and trying to make sure even though they were busy, they could accommodate us right away when everyone got there. It is a small place and gets busy because its delicious, so you might have to wait. They have slices to take away as well. We had the half salami/ rocket & half mushroom, ricotta & pumpkin seeds (SOOOO DELICIOUS!!), and half scallop, garlic and pancetta, half lamb shoulder and goats cheese (even better!!!) . I cannot recommend this place enough if you want a fun girls night out or a great date night.",

    "text": "We're found Homeslice on Yelp while searching for food that was a relatively short walking distance from our AirBnB in Covent Garden. We'd heard Yelp wasn't as reliable in Europe but this place certainly lived up to the hype! Located in \"Neal's Yard\" - a cozy little hidden courtyard full of excellent food and drink definitely worth checking out - Homeslice delivered some of the best pizza I've ever had. Be prepared to wait upwards of an hour if you go later in the evening and don't have a reservation (we passed the time with a beer at Craft Beer Co right around the corner). Once we were seated though the service was fast and the food was delivered quickly. We choose one pizza with a garlic based sauce and some white cheeses, and another more traditional Italian meat style pizza. Both would hold their own against some of the better pizza joints in San Diego. Highly recommend this spot for anyone looking for good pizza or a fun night out in Covent Garden!",

    "text": "There's little for me to add to all those who have waxed lyrical about the incredible Pizza at homeslice. I approached this place with caution, despite the generous reviews on yelp. So let's get personal, I popped in hoping for a snack and despite the size of the pizza, the thinness of the crust makes this snack-worthy and meal-worthy. I ordered 3 slices between two people, they even give you a slicer to share their slices (blatantly know that they're too big). The pizzas are very thin, so a lot of folding technique will be involved here, not to worry, all those origami folds weren't mastered in vain. We had the margherita, courgette and artichoke, and a salami (and something something pizza). So many things about homeslice are great, but the best thing is the well seasoned and perfectly baked dough - I'd be happy to eat just crust, and I'm not even a bread-lover (I know, I know, judge away). The margarita was tasty and tomato-y. I like tomato. The courgette and artichoke pizza was delicious. So much so, I've already decided that I'm having a whole one to myself next time. There were some other great choices challked up on the board, like the cauliflower cheese, aubergine and spinach pizza, or the pulled pork with mint pesto or something pizza.I didn't go down the route of drinks on this occasion, but they seem to have beer, prosecco and other good things on tap which I will need to try. All I know, is that I need to come here again. It's phenomenal.",

I don't know if its the best pizza I have ever had, its good and the novelty 20\" size (two toping choice possible) is a great idea but to be honest it was a little bit floppy when cut. - a few people complain the cutters are blunt, and yeah they are but they get the job done!We turned up on a friday evening and had to put our name down for a table of 6. We were told it would be 30 minutes and turned up a little late, this was lucky as the table wasnt yet ready. When it was ready turned out they thought we said 3 people, to there credit they quickly sourced another table for three but in a different paet of the restaurant...... after a little chat with some other patrons we managed to get a table altogether. They have a good selection of beers and we had a cracking meal. The waitress was helpful with suggestions and also joined in on the lad banter that was going on. My one concern with this place is its very small and if you turn up at the wrong time you may just have to go hungry. :-(",

Only slightly more private though as they crammed in to close to each other that the couple next to us had to move their table about a foot for me to get through the gap! The vibe is cool here though and it reminded me a lot of some of the pizza joints in New York, with the pizza taking up most of the table, no cutlery and paper plates.Our good friend Kirsty was with us this evening so we ordered a few a Camden Hells Lager each and got down to choosing our toppings. Every option sounded awesome but we settled on half Goat Shoulder with red kale & sumac yoghurt and half Mushroom, ricotta, pumpkin seeds & chilli flakes.Both were gorgeous. Crispy, slightly chewy and tasty dough with generous helpings of each topping. The combinations work brilliantly on their own or in this 50/50 style, especially the tender goat with cool yoghurt.We really enjoyed Homeslice, it's definitely one of the best pizza places in London. It can be a wait to get in but they take your number so you're free to go off and grab a drink in the meantime. I'm very keen to go back and their interesting, exciting toppings certainly help them stand apart from the competition.",

There is a a good variety of interesting/more adventurous toppings compared to most pizza restaurants. There were 3 veggie options. I had a veggie pizza which was densely packed with mushrooms and ricotta. The base is nice and thin, but was a little charred in places for my taste. My boyfriend got the brisket pizza which was a little sparse in toppings, but he assured me that the rich flavour of the sauce and meat made up for this. Very yummy!

No pasta, no sides, just pizza. \u00a34/slice or \u00a320 for a 20 inch pizza that's begging to be shared by at least two.Pizza. So what? Why not go to Domino's?Because this is the best pizza in London. Straight out of the pizza oven come almost impossibly thin and crispy pizzas with few ingredients. The margherita is a standout as a direct result of this - the ingredients do the talking. Imagine the best pizza you've had - this is better. I'm a particular fan, somewhat bizarrely, of the crust - it's jam-packed full of flavour.My one gripe with HomeSlice is that it's ever-so-slightly inconsistent. Pizzas can come slightly under- or over-cooked, and with quite significant variations in the amount of toppings - like a distinct dearth of mozzarella on my last visit.Everything I've just said negatively about HomeSlice, however, is entitled and should be ignored. That I'm able to be so bloody picky about pizza in London is quite frankly incredible. But when you've tasted pizza perfection at HomeSlice, continued pursuit of that perfection becomes addictive.",

Okay, so four slices for \u00a320 kind of sucks compared to a whole pizza for \u00a320, but when you can only finish two (mind you, they are huge), it's \u00a38 really well spent. Plus, I don't know any other pizza joint in London that does slices (if you do, hit me up!)I feel like you either love it or hate it here. The first time I was like, why is the base so chewy?? I don't understandd.. This is not pizza?!?! And by the fifth slice I think my jaw was a little tired.. How I even ate that much I do not know. But I now know this to be 'real' new york pizza and hey, I like it. So it's sometimes too charred at the bottom and its floppyness gets annoying at times but they really do the best flavours!They used to have this amazing mushroom one with maybe feta and pumpkin seeds with the best balsamic glaze drizzled over. I can't explain it but there's something about the ambitious complexity of flavours that you don't ever expect on pizza. It's so unassuming! I really like mushrooms and have had them foamed, freeze dried and turned into sand at fancy fine dining places but this is my favourite mushroom 'dish' OF ALL TIME. Well, was :( :( :( :( :( (I REALLY AM VERY SAD ABOUT THIS PLEASE BRING IT BACK!)I'd go into more detail about the other varieties but this rambling review is long enough so in short, yes it's crowded and busy and there's a line at any sensible hour but noooooo, just get take away, take the slice out of its little baggie, fold the plate in half and sort of slide the pizza into your mouth as you walk around seven dials.

Wood fire oven pizza that is closer to Roman and NY style than Neopolitan style pizza. Interesting toppings like haggis but also traditional ones appear on the menu. Just the right amount of toppings to keep it light. An airy space with indoor and outdoor seating, both shared tables and individual tables. Prompt and attentive service aiming to please. No reservations and the queue can get long but the turnover is fast. Not my first choice for pizza but I will be back!",

I had the margherita and the salami, rocket, & parmesan. Both were excellent: the pizza is thin, there was a perfect amount of crust, and the toppings are quality. Because the pizza is so thin and the slices are so large, it can be a bit of a handful to try to hold and eat them, so get ready to be a little messy and use a lot of napkins. There is no silverware provided, so mentally prepare yourself. (I myself do not usually eat pizza with silverware, but in this instance it would have been nice since the pizza is a little challenging to tackle otherwise.)The place was extremely crowded but not unpleasantly so, and the hostess gave me a very accurate estimate of how long I'd be waiting for a table. I didn't have to wait long since I was eating alone, but larger groups should expect a bit of a wait. Additionally, you can give them your mobile number and browse the shops or get a drink while waiting for your table (I would recommend this as there's not really room to stand around and wait inside the restaurant). If you do stand and wait near the front door, take the time to look over the menu on the board -- they don't bring paper menus to your table, so if you have poor eyesight (like myself) you'll end up needing your server to give you a quick overview of the menu. The service was quick, polite, and pleasant. For what it's worth, if you're not particularly comfortable eating alone this is not the place to try it out. You WILL be put at a table with another party as the space is so small and it's so popular.Despite any short-comings with lack of silverware or the crowded space, this pizza is the best I've found in London and absolutely worth a stop in.",

    "text": "Who likes white pizzas? Normally, not I, said the Katie. The artichoke and courgette pizza from Homeslice? Sorry, can't talk. Mouth full.Tucked in the somewhat hard to find Neal's Yard, I was so excited to see my favourite pizza food stall go brick and mortar. This is arguably my favourite pizza in London. Now, I know this is a controversial topic, so please don't jump all over me with how much you were disappointed once you tried it based on this review. If you like SUPER crispy pizza, this won't be for you. If you like super 'authentic' (whatever that means), this won't be for you.If you like interesting, if not experimental, toppings, intense and well thought out flavour, doughy, well-salted crust that is crisp on the outside, but delightfully chewy in the centre, this may be for you. You sort of have to fold it in half to eat it. Yes, eat it with your hands.\u00a320 will buy you a massive, 20inch pizza. You can choose two different pizzas and go half and half on the same 'pie' (as they say in America). They also have beer (just one kind?), and wine that they let you pour yourself. They come around with a ruler afterwards to see how much has been drunk and charge you based on that. Their tomato sauce is really nice-- super tangy. Andrew M. and I tried a half artichoke/courgette, half pork belly pizza. I preferred the lemony artichoke and courgette (with a garlic non-tomato base), but both were tasty. Next time, I want to try the basic fresh mozzarella/tomato/basil 'caprese' pizza. a good standard by which to judge pizza ingredients.**UPDATE: The Caprese is delicious too!!!! Possibly my favourite. Straight foward, tangy, and SO fresh tasting.",

So you can imagine how I feel about the trend of London restaurants making me wait in line for \u00a0the pleasure of eating food.Luckily Homeslice avoid my wrath by letting you leave a number and wander off for a drink. Add to that that they serve basically the best pizza I've ever eaten and they've avoided my ire entirely.With an ever-changing menu a return trip can be a little heart-wrenching (oh, Lincolnshire poacher how could you desert me?) but their menu options are always amazing and original (mint pesto? sure, why not?). The 20inch half and half is definitely the way to go and I've, so far, never been disappointed.I'm also overly fond of the giant wine bottles that they then measure to work out your bill; but that's primarily because that, paired with a giant pizza, means I can pretend to be a borrower. Always a good time.I've been here a few times now and will no doubt be back again. I just hope that they manage to open a larger version at some point - it is sometimes nice not to eat with a stranger's elbow in your side...",

Seriously though, the size of the tables is my one gripe about this place. \u00a0You have a booth for people to sit in, but the table is maybe only 2/3 the length of the booth. \u00a0Weird.But the pizza! \u00a0Oh, the pizza! \u00a0It's thin crust, which I find to be a necessity. \u00a0The pizza is a bit floppy and does require folding for munching, but it takes you back to an American sloppiness without the British politeness of eating pizza with utensils that I love. \u00a0We tried four types that evening, but the standout for me was the bone marrow pizza. \u00a0The oxtail and horseradish is a great flavor combo, but when I grabbed my slice, all the sauce came careening off, so that was a bit of a bummer. \u00a0The menu is super simple, and if you missed it on the board when you walked in, the waitstaff has pictures of it on ipads for you to take a gander.The waitstaff is hipster quirky for sure, but also super friendly and didn't even give us the stinkeye once, despite our closing the place down for the evening.I've already sung the praises of Homeslice to others, so I will hopefully be back soon!",

It definitely was a bit tricky to eat this pizza with no utensils.We opted for a half half of oxtail and salami which set us back 20GBP for a giant 20in pizza. They also offer some pizzas by the slice. The pizza crust was thin and crispy which was great for the first couple of slices but as the minutes ticked by it inevitably got softer and harder to eat. This is where the fork would have come in handy! The oxtail was good but a bit heavy on the horseradish. The salami was yum. Lots of crispy salami pieces topped with rocket!Seating can be a cramped here and it was hard to get in and out as the seats are pretty close together.",

Very fresh tasting with bold exciting flavours.The sumac yoghurt was a tad too liberally applied so overpowered the rest of the toppings but nonetheless was truly great.The real showstopper was the BBQ brisket which was an inspired choice.These pizza's are huge so one can be comfortably shared by two people unless you feel brave and go for one each (I did and had LOTS of leftovers).Drink selection was limited but they offered me a Brixton beer which is now a new fave.Win win.",

The rest need to be bought as a \u00a320 pizza - its recommended you share these and the restaurant will happily make them half one topping and half another.Positives:+ Pizzas (I tried 2) were really tasty, we finished all of our pizza easily.+ There are also some imaginative options (e.g. the cauliflower cheese pizza)+ Service was quick+ Decent value for moneyOn the other hand:- Limited tables for groups of 6+- Most choices require you to buy the 20\" pizza for \u00a320 so not great unless you're at least 2 people, really hungry (I reckon I could eat a whole one myself if necessary, they're quite thin) or happy to take leftovers home- Our crusts were very salty, I liked the taste but that much salt must be v bad...Overall: We've become very picky about our Friday lunches as spoilt for choice around Covent Garden but we agreed unanimously that we'll come back here.

Now, I pondered my options and thought 'well I can either sit at home and hear about what a wonderful time everyone had catching up or I can go and spend time with my friends'. I obviously opted for the latter and myself and a few of my friends contacted Homeslice to inform them I was coming and ask what options there were...None. Now I'd been expecting this, so asked them if I could bring a lunchbox so I could at least eat alongside my friends but they wouldn't even accommodate this request. So not wanting to cause a fuss, I settled on some food in the pub where we were having drinks and then we headed to Homeslice. We had to wait a long time for the table and the staff weren't that helpful. My friends ordered their pizzas and whilst they enjoyed them none of them were waxing lyrical although I half suspect this may have been for my benefit. All in all, it just didn't seem to live up to the hype for my friends and also left a sour note that they were so unwilling to accommodate me even if I brought my own food.",

    "text": "Located in one of the cutest areas of London - Neal's Yard - Homeslice's buzzing, loud atmosphere is a contrast to the romantic and quiet backalley (in a good way). The waitresses are not-in-your-face cool, maneuvering around the many little tables with giant pizzas and a good attitude.The restaurant is filled with 20somethings, primarily in groups of 2, shouting at each other over jaw-droppingly/conversation-startingy large pizzas with unlikely toppings. The fairly small room is quickly filled with the impressive pizza oven, the cooks throwing their dough in the air, the waiters' explanations of how this all works, the loud music and all the chatter. You get one giant 20 inch pizza for \u00a320 which you can split in half by topping. There are 10 choices only written on a chalkboard, because menus are so 2014.We went for the classic salami, rocket and parmesan, with mushroom, ricotta, pumpkin seeds and chili flakes (but, were vey tempted by the goat shoulder with red kale and sumac yoghurt!). Pizzas arrived quickly and were eaten off paper plates - who needs table space for plates when you have a giant pizza? You get your own pizza slicer, which in our case led to some irregularly sized slices... Sharing napkins and condiments between tables is encouraged and adds to the warm buzz of the place.The dough was thin, the crust was soft, the toppings are very well put together. The ricotta was so fresh, the salami wasn't greasy - you can almost pretend you're eating healthily. The chili flakes and pumpkin seeds gave the pizza a kick without making it too alien. I found the bottom of the pizza a little smokier than I would have preferred, but devoured all the crust, because it was incredible. Generally, one of the best pizzas in London.We went at 10pm and there was no queue, but larger groups behind us couldn't find an available table anymore. Definitely worth a try in a small group at an awkward hour!USP: Giant sharing pizzas, good price, gourmet toppings, (cool name).Go with: Somebody you don't mind shouting at, that can both share and eat. I'd say bff, sibling, fourth date.Price: Low - \u00a310 will fill you up!Comparison: Similar style to Franco Manca in terms of interesting toppings, dough was more similar to Pizza Pilgrims, but major wins on size of pizza for price, and collaborative atmosphere.",

    "text": "Who would have thought you could get good pizza in London. Being originally from the NY Metropolitan area, we are pizza snobs. Now we reside in Florida where pizza goes to die. I had read the reviews and figured, what the heck, lets try it. We stumbled into Neal's Yard, a cozy alcove of shops in Covent Garden/Soho and found a line out the door. There additionally were patrons sitting at the outside tables and doing takeout. Just maybe...So we went inside and were told it would be about 40 minutes before a section would be open. Folks this is community sitting and then some. There is not a spot to waste and forget about private conversations. Noise level is extremely high but that is a spacial thing. The chalkboard gives you the daily list of available pizzas; you can purchase a whole 20 incher or individual slices. Since it was just me and my wife we went for the slices of two different varieties. Thinking back, the 20 incher would have served us better even though it doesn't fit on the table. The poor girl next to us was having an awful time trying to hold her plate and eat at the same time. The slices were large and thin; so thin it flipped down and was foldable like real pizza. The combinations were not crazy and made real sense. Delicious with a good amount of sauce (good pizza should have the appropriate ratio of sauce to cheese leaning towards more sauce). The service was adequate and the wait staff should consider being gymnasts as they wiggled their way through the tight spaces expertly. We left sufficiently filled with enough room in our bellies to seek out gelato later. While we can't give it five stars as that is saved only for the very best, we do feel their effort in creating an actual real live pizza in a country not known for food is well worth high praise; praise I unfortunately cannot give to my current adopted home.",

Pro tip, go in with three others and split a whole pie for \u00a35.00, each. \u00a0 Super pro tip, you can select two toppings for a half-half pie.I have eaten my way through most of the toppings:SALAMI, ROCKET & PARMESAN - this is a fan favourite. My coworkers are always campaigning for this topping. This is a straightforward, traditional pizza, no explanation necessary. Personally, I am not a fan of Salami on pizza. \u00a0 \u00a0CHORIZO, CORN & CORIANDER - This is another group favourite. I like it better than the Salami, but it does tend to get a bit greasy if you don't eat it when it is at its peak heat. I quite like the cheese (maybe a cheddar, or some other sharp cheese) used on this one.CALABRIAN PEPPERS, CHERVIL & LINCOLNSHIRE POACHER - This is the all-time fan favourite and why Home Slice is earning 5 stars. Everyone loves this pizza. THIS IS A MUST ORDER!GOAT SHOULDER WITH RED KALE & SUMAC YOGHURT (G) - Most of my coworkers are off put by this \"exotic meat\". The goat holds up well in the pizza oven. I have never had kale on a pizza before, but after having it at Home Slice, I don't know why! Keep an open mind; give goat shoulder and kale a chance. OXTAIL & HORSERADISH CREAM (T) - Again, most of my coworkers were not having oxtail. But again, oxtail holds up really well in the pizza oven. Plus, I am a sucker for anything with horseradish. \u00a0If you want a unique pizza eating experience, go for the goat shoulder or oxtail (well.. half you need to get the pepper topping, obvi).",

Your restaurant is 1/2 empty, no need to be so bitchy about it. \u00a0I'd understand at 8 on Friday nights, but before 6 on Tuesday? \u00a0With nary a queue waiting? There is just no need for this kind of attitude.It's fine, we'll just go somewhere else, bitchface. \u00a0You don't have patience or kindness for me, I don't have the patience to deal with you either.",

    "text": "I had two bites of my first slice here and thought, I have to blog about this! I have to write a review. Although I neither write a blog or reviews. It's enough to say, the pizza here is Amazing. You either buy slices (\u00a34) or share a large pizza for \u00a320. Definitely doable for two people, or perfect to share between 3. We had half/half with pepperoni, rocket and parmesan, and chorizo, corn and coriander. The sauce on the salami pizza. Simply perfect. The chorizo pizza has a yellow creamed corn sauce which was lovely too, and a bit different. I'm coming back to try the caprese pizza I've heard is The Best Ever. Still, I don't feel we missed out on my first visit here.It can be busy at lunch time, but the wait was only 20 min. They take your number so you can walk around covent garden and before you know it your table is ready. Definitely worth the wait!",

    "text": "This is the way pizza is meant to be. Thin, lightly charred, wood-fired crust. Delicious sauce. Gourmet ingredients.Staff is very friendly and master at managing the masses storming the gates (and they are always storming the gates.)The place itself is chill and fun. Long, shared tables (count on a quasi-public conversation and the occasional bumped elbows), but everyone is jovial and having fun.First time I discovered this place, I ate there three times that first week. Now I have to force myself to only go twice (for my waistline) as Homeslice is just...that...good.",

    "text": "Pammie and I came here based on what we;d heard from other people. It was a place we 'just had to eat at'. I was not disappointed.We opted for pizza by the slice (20\" seemed a bit much for lunch!) so we got to try three different toppings. They all tasted amazing. The mushroom one was perhaps a little too mushroomey (I know. I never thought I'd say that), but they were all really tasty.It's a very communal eating kind of place. You sit on long tables with strangers and attempt to eat the floppiest pizza in the world. If you order a 20\" that's pretty much fine. They give you a pizza cutter - so you just cut smaller slices. If you are given slices however. you have only your hands. They are massive (yay) but you have no way of cutting them without getting covered in the sauce / topping (you just tear into it). I know this is a minor thing but Pammie and I had a few shops to go to afterwards and the idea of going clothes shopping with sticky pizza hands isn't the greatest thing in the world.It would have been nice to have some wet wipes or something to take the edge off the stickiness.The service was pretty attentive, given how busy they were. We had to wait Nando's-esq in a corner by the door for a few minutes. Which was ok, if inconvenient.I'd recommend coming here if you're in the area. Just expect to leave a little sticky.",

    "text": "I really liked this place. \u00a0The pizza is very thin and crispy with excellent ingredients. \u00a0So thin in fact that if you don't eat it within 10 minutes or so, it starts to flop out. \u00a0I doubt this pizza travels well, but it was delicious right out of the wood fired oven. \u00a0Did a half and half pizza because they only offer one size, large! \u00a0The sweet corn and chorizo side was soooo good. \u00a0The chorizo was excellent and really made the pizza. \u00a0The mushroom, ricotta and pepitas side was pretty awesome as well. \u00a0The ricotta is super creamy. \u00a0Really nice.Got a couple of slices of margherita as well. \u00a0Really crispy from the second bake. \u00a0really good.Love the fact that they bring you a huge bottle of wine and you help yourself as much as you like (they measure when you are done and then you pay for the amount of glasses you drank). \u00a0 \u00a0Offer whole pizzas and slices. \u00a0Very simple menu, very nicely done.I'll be back for this. \u00a0For sure.",
