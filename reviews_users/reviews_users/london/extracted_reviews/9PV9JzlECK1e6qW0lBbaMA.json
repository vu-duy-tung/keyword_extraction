I can tell their focus is more the food, so I was looking forward to that. There are surprisingly few veggie options for an asian noodle place. I got the yasai katsu curry, because it sounded different and interesting; it was decent but actually didn't have as much flavor as I expected. I'll probably go back and try a noodle dish to see if there are better results, but I don't have high expectations at this point.",

Just like other poorly managed franchise, everything kept in a very low standard. The soup was warm (not hot) when brought to table, this makes it lost flavour and taste bad, the noodle taste just like instant noodles, and most of all, the service was horrible! We got totally ignored for the whole meal time, and the restaurant was only half seated! The waitress seemed trying to avoid to come to our table, though it was our first time there. We chose this restaurant because I checked the review on Yelp and it got 4 stars from over 30 reviews. I had to say that London people are realy nice and had low requirement of their restaurant. \u00a0Never come again, will look for other options if want noodles.",

That said, Wagamama's is usually a reliable bet for Asian fusion food, and last night proved no exception as I and a friend ate here before going to the theatre. The quality of the food was good, and service was correct and rapid, if slightly impatient during the ordering process at times. Pricing is (as every) reasonable -- perhaps slightly expensive compared to the individual Asian canteens, but the food quality makes up for it.This particular Wagamama's is very well-placed in the Cardinal Place complex, merely 5 minutes walk away from Victoria station, and very close to both the Apollo Victoria and the Victoria Palace theatres. Its location is also picturesque, on the quieter upper tier next to the SW1 Gallery and on the partially glass-covered courtyard. A restful place to eat before the theatre, with no need to worry about slow service!",

This time, I had a raw salad and the signature Wagamama Ramen. The salad was fine--I was just happy to have some greens instead of the heavy pies, sausages & gravies I had been eating the prior week in Northern England. The ramen itself was filled with lots of delicious things - pork, shrimp, chicken, mussels, a tea egg, chikuwa and wakame. I didn't find the broth to be very flavorful - in fact, I had to add soy sauce to add salt as it just tasted bland without it. And well, this is not their fault, but this just reconfirmed that I really don't like mussels. If you do like mussels, then you will be happy with the amount they add to the bowl, but if you don't, it might just be best to ask them to not add them at all.Other than that, everything else was pretty enjoyable and despite being super crowded, my service was very attentive from start to finish.",

We had the squid to start. The seasoning and the dipping sauce didn't add that much flavour so it was still quite dull. For my main I had the vegetarian noodles with mushrooms, eggs and veggies. They were quite nice, the portion was very generous and I was very satisfied.For desert we had the new banana pudding with salted caramel ice cream which was lovely. The service was very quick, literally straight off the wok to the table.",

    "text": "I doubt I can add much that's new to the many, many Wagamama reviews already on here, so I'll just echo the basics: it's a large, spacious, minimally decorated room, service is friendly enough, and the food is delicious and reasonably priced by London standards.This location seems to get a lot of business lunch-hour traffic, but by 1:30 pm on a Tuesday, we could walk in and be seated right away. The large outside tables are family-style, so you might very well have to scoot up next to strangers and pass the soy sauce.I had the pork ramen bowl, which was a generous portion and had meltingly tender pork bits, although the best part of the dish was actually the crisp, fresh bamboo shoots - go figure. My boyfriend had the ginger chicken udon and thought it was good as well.Maybe it was being out in the patio area, but service seemed spotty and somewhat chaotic - we were served by a variety of different staff and were never really sure who our server was if we needed something. Getting the check was pretty slow, which was a bit surprising, since it sounds like they're known for fast turnover. Overall, I was glad to have tried the much-hyped Wagamama experience and thought they delivered fresh and tasty food for a decent price.",

Also introduced three new people to Wagamama, so I was psyched.Our service was great. We sat outside on a lovely day and it was quiet during an early Monday dinner time. Drinks came quickly, as did the food as always. I had the udon noodles, a change from my normal ramen (largely because they have gotten rid of the seafood ramen, which was always my favorite). It was tasty, with slight spice but overall good flavor. You can't go wrong with udon. My wife and her aunt had chicken raisukaree - chicken with Japanese curry. It was really very good, but both of them felt a little iffy afterwards. Neither had had Japanese curry before, so likely that's the situation. Wife's uncle had ramen, and enjoyed it. So, all food was good but none was amazing. Solid outing, but I still find the food at other locations better for whatever reason. Will always return to Wagamama, but I still prefer Mansion House.",

Had to add soy sauce or chili flakes to both curry udon noodles and the 'chili' ramen with chicken.The good: the prawn gyoza were actually quite good and would def order that.-the japanese nest beer was very goodThe bad:-the chili ramen was not spicy not hot, but is called chili as they sprinkles a few pieces of chili on top. The broth and ingredients were basically vietnamese pho, without the robust flavor of pho not the right noodles for it. Epic failure-the stained egg is actually a confuses attempt at japanese soft boiled egg used in ramen, since they also tried to infuse soy sauce flavor like chinese tea eggs. The execution and result? Well , confused. Half the 'stain' was ripped off since they prepared incorrectly and it wasnt runny at all, and no flavor-curry udon fried noodles. Udon well cooked, which was great. Everything else however tasted like what i might make at home by throwing leftovers on top of fried noodles Finally, food is always based relative to price. This was priced like a japanese one star michelin restaurant but was quality of a cafeteria...",

We ordered ebi(shrimp) katsu for starters and the shirodashi ramen (pork belly ramen with in chicken broth), I am so glad we shared the ramen because the sizes are really generous! I really liked the ebi katsu, really flavorful sauces and shrimp was fried perfectly. The pork belly was really tender, the fatty parts basically melted in your mouth! Good flavors to the broth, but I was a little disappointed in the egg, usually ramen eggs are marinated in a combination of mirin and soy sauce, other than that the food was really delicious.

The BBQ pork buns were probably my favorite of the meal. The meat was spicy and the Japanese mayo was a nice touch. The Chicken Katsu Curry was delicious and a very generous portion. The Chili Ramen was terrrribleeee. I got the top sirloin and it was inedible- tough, chewy, and no flavor. The copious amount of raw onion on top made the broth taste disgusting.

So I opted for the ginger chicken udon. They use pickled ginger, which I was a bit iffy about at first since I'm not usually a fan. But this was actually really good. The flavor paired well with the saltiness of the noodles. The chicken tasted a bit leftover-y but I still ate everything since I was starving. We have one Wagamama location in NYC so I'll probably go and try the ramen there (though I'm sure it won't be as good).

The veg ramen was excellent and the chicken raisukaree was the best dish we had. Perfectly flavoured and good amount of veggies I would go back for this dish. The service was fantastic and very friendly. Love this place.",

    "text": "Before my trip to London, my friend strongly recommended Wagamama, particularly the one in Westminster- saying it's one of the best ramen he has ever had (anywhere). \u00a0There was a Wagamama right across my hotel in SoHo but I had to do my friend justice by going to the location he raved about. \u00a0The (lack of) queue: We came in around 3:30p and there were no lines. \u00a0The restaurant had a lot of seatings but luckily it was a fairly quiet afternoon. \u00a0The food: We ordered Asahi beer (yum, classic), fried squid, Wagamama ramen, and Ginger Chicken udon, which were all delicious! The ramen's broth was not as creamy as what I'm used to back home but I love the fact that you can drink the entire bowl and it was not salty. \u00a0I would describe the bowl as the healthiest ramen bowl I've eaten (lol). \u00a0My friend described the broth as slightly bland. \u00a0(To each their own I guess lol). \u00a0Although it was a good ramen bowl, I don't think I would order it again - I rather try something else on their extensive menu. BUT I would definitely recommend the fried squid and ginger chicken udon! \u00a0The texture of the udon was to die for - I'm huge on texture of noodles and these were on point. I'm always catious of ordering chicken dishes because in most cases, the chicken is too dry. \u00a0Unforunately, the chicken that came in the ramen bowl was dry but the chicken in the udon dish was absolutely delicious. \u00a0Surprisingly, I liked all the bean sprouts that came with this dish. \u00a0If I were to order the udon dish again, I'd ask to put the ginger on the side. \u00a0Sometimes it was too much for me. \u00a0Wagamama needs to be on your list of to-do's if you're visiting London.",

    "text": "I credit wagamama for embarking me on my ramen journey years ago. It's the first place I can remember trying the Japanese noodles outside of the microwaveable college staple variety, the first time I found out such a legitimized version even existed, and I had a glorious \"well, well, well... and what is this?\" moment that's stuck with me over time as a result. After a decade hiatus, and many American ramen adventures in the interim, I was excited to return to London and re-visit where it all began.As it turns out, my ramen palate has evolved since my humble beginnings slurping noodles at a British-based, pan-Asian restaurant chain. I ordered the Shirodashi Ramen (pork belly in bulgogi sauce, chicken broth with dashi and miso, pea shoots, menma, spring onions, wakame, tea-stained egg) and the broth was a bit thin and needed more flavor, while the noodles were somewhat clumpy. But I gotta tell you, ramen is ramen, and none of these nitpicks stopped me from scarfing down the whole bowl. That, and a bottle of Hitachino White Ale (a pricier Japanese import beer in the US) was a steal.This specific wagamama is on the second floor of an indoor/outdoor shopping centre, with its typical communal seating set-up. Our initial waitress was a bit of an alarmist when she found out there was a food allergy at the table, saying that we might not be able to order anything. Thankfully, that was not the case and the accommodating manager took over our table and guided us through appropriate options.Fittingly, there was a group of guests in their late-teens / early-twenties not far from our seats, a group that probably didn't look all too different from mine years ago when I first entered a wagamama. Perhaps I'm giving too much credit to this chain, because my nostalgia for this place sadly slipped away as I realized how inferior its ramen was to most other ramens I've had in between. Or perhaps other ramen joints have just gotten that much better. Or perhaps I've just gotten older and more judge-y and should just shut up and enjoy quick-service ramen for what it is. Probably that last one. Regardless, to the aforementioned random group of British uni kids, I pass the ramen torch to you, young millennials.",

I ordered the chicken ramen and my boyfriend ordered the chilli chicken ramen. Both were mediocre as they were pretty watery and had grilled chicken/pork.. odd. Though the most disappointing part was the service. They didn't let us sit out on the patio even though they were still operating for at least an hour, and it was a beautiful night. Also our waiter was pretty dissatisfactory and rude. When I asked if they were able to give me lean pork instead of the usual fatty one, he said 'No we don't do that.. you get what we make.' There we're other little remarks that we're unpleasant. Overall, this is not the place to go for a nice ramen dinner, it is a cafeteria style place with a very loud atmosphere that gave limited attention to the actual guests.",

The noodles lacked flavor, too much of the other things, the noodles needed to be fried longer to get the crunchy taste. Chili squid was ok. Nothing to rave about. The chasu bun was amazing. The bun itself was moist, warm, and melts in your mouth. The pork was done right and really flavorful. I was not a fan of the Korean BBQ one. Just the flavors were meh, overall, meh. Wouldn't recommend. Two stars for chasu bun and free wifi :)",
