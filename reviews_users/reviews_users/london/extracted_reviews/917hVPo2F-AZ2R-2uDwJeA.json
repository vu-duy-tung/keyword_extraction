Make sure you book ahead as its usually packed. Great food, yummy free bread sticks while you wait for your Food. The mains are decently sized (pork and apple to die for!!) the wines were lovely and the desert (can I reccomend the trifle!!!) all great!! and resonably priced. Lovely staff also!",

It was closed in the afternoon anyway.)",

The upstairs dining area was a bit stuffy and I think I may have just had really bad luck with ordering. The duck I ordered was way too salty and the dessert I had clearly hadn't been properly defrosted not a good sign considering their above average prices. My dining partner had better luck but still nothing spectacular. I think I'll stick with grabbing a beer in the pub area in the future.",

Unfortunately thats where the good stuff ends. 3 of us had a ploughmans recently and it was by far the worst quality I have ever had the misfortune to be served, the bread was stale, cheese rancid, tomatoes and celery tasteless and the portions (thankfully!) miniscule. When we complained we were told the manager would pop over- nothing happened- when we pressed on this the waitress was rude and said it was meant to be like that! I suppose the arrogance and ignorance must come from the top down. Big shame as we would never visit again and hope the rumour that it is on the market is true and that it passes into ownership of people who care about their customers and produce decent food.",

Owned by Gordon Ramsay, the Warrington is popular with media peoples and committed locals alike. Retaining it's orginal atmosphere by serving real ale, organising quiz machines and keeping prices steady, the Warrington makes a good choice for those who aren't too interested in an overly pretenious venue. Upstairs (previously home to Ben's Thai restaurant) has been redeveloped as part of Gordon's plans to develop the orginal venue into a gastro pub. It's definately worth checking out.",

The gorgeous exterior and interior of this former hotel, former Gordon Ramsey venue make me want to return to experience the ambience and let my eyes wander over the exquisite woodwork, tiles, and frescos, BUT there's always a detractor on each visit. Either the staff ignores me, they're out of one or more taps, they don't know how to mix a drink I order or they're closing early.  \u00a0 \u00a0 And yet, I know I'll go back. It's such an architectural gem that I want to show it to friends who visit me in my neighborhood. Could this be why the management doesn't attend to the details of running a top-notch establishment? It seems like they owe it to the building. \u00a0 \u00a0 The front entry to the main pub is the grand entrance to the old hotel (no longer a hotel, and YELP should delete the Warrington Hotel listing option). There are mosaics on the steps and tiles on the columns and walls that will dazzle you with their beauty. Inside is a large pub with a semi-circular bar on the left, and tables to the right and in the back. A large staircase toward the back goes upstairs to the dining room.  \u00a0 \u00a0 There's also a door (both outside and from the main pub) to a second set of rooms to the left of the main entrance. In front is a cozy fireplace with a leather tucked sofa and two chairs in front of it. The fire was going the last time I was there and I vowed that the next time I was there it would be with a date--very romantic! High on the wall, over the exquisite dark wood paneling in that room, is a frescoed lunette with two art noveau woman ala Alphonse Mucha, hovering over you. \u00a0 \u00a0 Behind the front salon is a smaller bar with just a few tables, a quieter option from the main bar. \u00a0 \u00a0 The Warrington sits on the corner of Randolph and Warrington Crescent and has enough space on the corner lot for several tables and benches, to catch the overflow and smokers on the busy nights.",

Apparently they found mouse droppings in the kitchen, under the sink and in the window sills. I'm writing this review as if I didn't know that, but be advised that mousecrap supersedes whatever tasty things I had at The Warrington I started out with the potted duck with apple and onion chutney. I wasn't sure if the lukewarmness of this dish was intentional or not, but I found it to be a nice light start to the meal. Bread was meh. The main was a braised lamb shank with sweet potato mash. Lamb shank should fall off the bone and melt in your mouth. This did that, but unfortunately what fell of the bone was mostly fat. Ick. I also wish there was some sort of a vegetable served along with this. Lamb is good, sweet potatoes are excellent, but I need something to cut the salt and sweet. That said though, there were some really nice flavours out of this. The broth was really nice. The Warrington's food was just ok. The building itself is just gorgeous. Considering the whole mouse crap thing, I won't go back to the restaurant proper, but I enjoyed my meal enough when I was there. I would definitely spend time in the pub downstairs though. It was also nice they had a California Zin on the glass list. You don't see that every day in England.",

    "text": "The Warrington, Gordon Ramsay's latest investment of \u00a36million opened earlier this month, without publicity, but rumour has it that it is already fully booked for several weeks due to word-of-mouth recommendations.Kate Moss is among those who have been seen eating at the pub in Warrington Crescent, Maida Vale.The Warrington features an art nouveau bar and dining room and has been renovated extensively by the celebrity chef who bought it more than a year ago.The TV chef seems to be sticking to a very down to earth menu and doing his best to keep the locals happy by considerately restoring the pub's listed Victorian interior. The menu features classics such as steak and kidney pie (\u00a311.50) plus more adventurous dishes like braised Gloucester pig cheeks with Swede (\u00a311.00) and roast Guinea Fowl with Puy lentils and bacon (\u00a313.25). Bar snacks include pork pies (\u00a36) and pickled cockles (\u00a31.50).The pub's archaic stained-glass windows, mosaic-tiled porch, stone fireplace and frescoes featuring semi-naked women attests to its origin as a brothel, later became known as Warrington Hotel- have all been retained.The Warrington is run by Mark Sargeant, the former head chef at Ramsay's Claridge's restaurant, who is responsible developing the Ramsay group's expansion into pubs.It was bought by Gordon Ramsay Holdings as part of a strategy to conquer London's gastropub market.Last week, Ramsay purchased his fourth venture - the York And Albany in Camden, which is set to reopen in May.His two other pubs are The Narrow in Limehouse and The Devonshire in Chiswick, are being received positively in their respective localities. At best I think you could end up paying around 30.00 for lunch and 45.00 for dinner ot just go in for a drink and eat for under tenner.",

    "text": "I live in the area and have been going to the Warrington for the last twelve years. As a keen cook, follower of TV chefs and owner of too many cook books, including Ramsay books, I was delighted when I heard that Ramsay was taking over the Warrington. This was my local and we eat out regularly and were thrilled. A long time went by for the refurbishment during which time the Thai restaurant owners moved to local Browning p.h. (never mind we thought good food was on its way) Now my review... soon after the restauant opened we had one very nice evening restaurant meal, the baked cod was really good and we liked the atmosphere of the restaurant; I recall the bread was lovely.. next time, not so good, only fish on menu was salmon, which was Okish., not put off we took our son and friends there for his 21st birthday and again just a limited OK meal at high cost. I firmly believe in giving local restautants a chance but our next meal was so very poor with poor starter and main meal. This is not a cheap menu the cooking is now totally sub-standard. That aside, my real main moan is that recently we went to our local (Warrington) for the pub quiz and ordered (not had) a salt beef sandwich. What arrived was nothing remotely like a salt beef sandwich; white bread mixed with some sort of meat mixed with some sort of cream. On speaking to manager who came to see us after some considerable time, he confessed he had never had a salt beef sandwich before and did not know what it was. (he was a manager not a chef) - I did not establish who had prepared this totally substandard expensive mess). The sandwiches were taken away and we were offered complimentary desserts - not what we wanted - what an absolute disaster - perhaps Ramsay should do a Gordon Ramsays 'My own Hell Kitchens\" Now, when we go for a drink/meal in our local area we go anywhere but our local - try the Salt House Abbey Road, Clifton Hotel or go the Browning where the Thai restaurant has moved to. Ramsay taking over our local has been a disaster; great pub but then it always was - what a total disappointment. Tina, St John's Wood, NW8",

While the pub itself is really great with lots of character and a really local crowd who clearly has been going there before Mr Ramsay came, the restaurant was a bit of a disappointment.First the room, which has a great volume, is really poorly decorated. White, beige and light grey dominate with some dark wood tables but the inconsistent lighting (strong in the main room, low on the side) create an atmosphere best described as greyish, not warm at all in a room which has so much potential. More important is the food which again was a bit puzzling. It's never great when you arrive in what is supposed to be a fantastic restaurant (not talking about anything too exotic here) and then you dont know what to order because of lack of inspiration The menu is very down to earth and wintery (snails, pies, duck, steak, sole) and I ended up having endives with stilton as a starter followed by a choucroute. It was good in decent quantities (probably right if you want to have 3 courses). We ended up sharing a crumble which was really good (and light with liquid cream on top). Finally the service was rather average which was surprising for a Ramsay kind of place. The highlight of the dinner (beyond the dessert) was the wine, a very good Bordeaux decently priced. We did end up spending over \u00a350 a head including service so that was a bit steep So we spent a good evening with our friends but really found that the place looked too formal and lacked both character and warmth. I will stick to my other favourite gastro pubs who are much more lively and warm while serving great food (The Cow, The Westbourne) in the area.",

Some hits, some not so much. I've decided I can't go wrong with bangers and mash, anything with chips involved, and salads. Their sausage roll and Scotch egg also made a good impression. The prices were reasonable and the staff was incredibly friendly and fast. I should have taken them up on their offer to return for New Year's Eve.",

My boyfriend and I walked in, perhaps one of the few tourists in the not so crowded bar, and the blonde waiter completely ignored our order, simply walking by us over and over. We sat at the only available table, waited for it to be cleaned for a good ten minutes then asked to order at the bar \"because they are too busy\". \u00a0I, now the only female standing at the bar, waited fifteen minutes for someone to get my order. All the locals were attended to, but I was completely ignored by the same blonde male waiter while he attended to all the locals. Racist much? I had to yell out excuse me.. Probably not coming back here again. Wouldn't recommend it if you're not blonde/English looking.Oh and our burger was cold and tasteless.",

It's big, Gordon Ramsey owns it (most people say it was much better before he bought it) it's expensive (\u00a312 for a vodka orange and a Kopparberg) and the \"locals\" are some old farts with huge bellies, who are very drunk and they really try to impress you by pinching your bum. The toilets are unisex- which is a great idea- but again, if you're stuck with the old drunks in there - no fun!Gypsy bands lurk around the pub and once they start playing, you are surrounded by young boys asking for money... and they insist.The place has a very Victorian air to it and the garden, again, is big. On a Friday night it's very crowded - I don't think there was anyone inside, except for the people at the bar. Obviosuly, I had to wait ages until I got my drink.",

Fortunately when Gordon Ramsey took over and gastro-pubbed this place he didn't change much. The gorgeous art nouveau style panelling is still there. I think there was maybe a dart board before, and he did kick out Ben's Thai from upstairs though ('dang!' a Maida Vale institution), but fortunately they have found a new home in the Sam Smith pub down the road. I also think the pub looks quintessentially English as has two big red telephone boxes outside. I'm sure they are there just for show (I bet you Ramsey rents them), as I have never seen anyone use them ever.Good beer and wine menu. I haven't tried the food here yet, I have to admit from all reports I don't hold high hopes, especially after the frozen ready meal controversy (see Wikipedia). However they appear to have a reasonable price set menu for autumn so I will come back, and let you know how it works out.",

But, it couldn't have been more different; we were served frozen fries a la Tesco/chicken shop, the service was poor (until we got a little bit narky later in the night at what we had experienced), and they wouldn't serve us the drinks they had the last time (even despite our bad experience).

The chips we ordered came out as frozen French fries from a bag without any warning that they wouldn't the homemade ones from before. A big letdown from the previous visit. Instead, I ordered the paprika chicken. So misleading because the title suggests it's going to have lots of flavour. It was so bland, I was so disappointed with my \"diet\" dish. The waitress did try her best to make up for our disappointment, bless her. She gave us all she could to make up for it. It was just a series of unfortunate events for the Warrington that night.

    "text": "I'm not a fan of Gordon Ramsay as a television star. I think his aggressively abrasive egomaniacal personality is appalling, and the crude way he demeans everyone who crosses his path is deplorable. As a result, I never would intentionally seek out one of his restaurants, but friends who live in St. John's Wood brought us here, and I'm sorry they did, because they spent far more than the meal warranted.First of all, the pub is spectacular, from its stunning mosaic floor to its stained glass windows to its marble fireplace to its Art Deco details and Victorian fixtures. The decor in the contemporary dining area is crisp and clean, although the tables are much too close together to allow for private conversations.As someone who fancies himself to be perfect, Ramsay needs to keep a tighter rein on his kitchen crew and wait staff. None of the food that reached our table was extraordinary, and there were long delays between courses. Our friendly waiter was very apologetic, but he seemed to have trouble handling a full station.My chicken liver and game p\u00e2t\u00e9 was slightly dry but the spiced plum chutney served with it was a wonderful complement. My husband's onion soup was thin and bland, surprising underseasoned. He had better luck with his entree, succulent roasted pork belly served with kale and pur\u00e9ed onions and a slightly too-sweet raspberry sauce, but my lamb steak was so overcooked I had to send it back. The replacement finally arrived after everyone else had nearly finished eating, and it was neither hot nor medium rare as I ordered. Our friends thought their selections - roast baby chicken and hangar steak - were adequate but nothing special. The fig and almond tart with clotted cream was slightly dry, and the caramel sauce served with the sticky toffee pudding was much too thick. Coffee was excellent.The restroom looked and smelled like it hadn't been cleaned in a week, and we left without using it.After this experience, I truly believe Gordon Ramsay is a legend only in his own mind.",

The drinks aren't that expensive (about 4 pounds for a 10yr single malt), there is plenty of room, and a pleasant crowd spanning varied ages. Nice leather chairs, and I think I saw a quieter section with a fire place on one end.

The pub downstairs is a decent size (tables and seats for maybe 50?), and is beautifully decorated in a style reminiscent of how a British pub should be - with a few lavish touches. My drink of choice (vodka, soda and fresh lime) is \u00a32.80, the staff are great and the music is as well. Really fun pub quiz on a Monday night (\u00a33 entry per person, max. team of five), and posh pub food - but no Sky.My lovely other half took my Mum and I to the restaurant upstairs a few weeks ago, and I fell in love a little bit. It's like stepping into a Victorian dining room, with a lot of light and standard white-table-clothed service.We went on a Sunday, and though I was tempted by the set lunch menu (\u00a318 for two courses, \u00a322 for three) - we all had roast beef. It was THE BEST I've ever had out. You can't compare restaurant cooked to that served at home, you just can't. We also had some tasty home-made bread, and amazing deserts. The best was the tarte tartin, and the dark chocolate mousse - with blood orange sorbet to die for. Reading the reviews to my right, I totally disagree with the negative ones - but I always think that who you go anywhere with makes a massive difference.I'm considering booked one of the private rooms for my birthday. An all together perfect weekend eatery and a great pub to boot.",

    "text": "The Warrington Hotel is renowned as having one of the finest pub interiors in London, and is now part of the Gordon Ramsay empire. Mr Ramsay himself is said to dislike the 'gastro-pub' label, (good so far) and so has retained the downstairs bar as a pub, and created a fine dining restaurant upstairs. (NB It is no longer a hotel as such - there's no accommodation). Built in 1859 and extensively refurbished in 1900, the classical white Italianate exterior belies the opulence within: only the entrance pillars, with their green and blue glazed tiles with plant motifs, and a pair of huge iron-and-glass lamps hint at the splendour to come. The bar area is dominated by a huge curved bar, with a marble counter and carved mahogany base. Elsewhere, Tiffany-style lamps compete with etched and stained glass, murals, mosaics, elaborate plaster work and yet more glazed tiles. The style is hard to define - a sort of art-nouveau crossed with arts-and crafts. The restaurant, on the other hand, is restrained cool in the extreme: creams, greys and beiges make for a calm, if slightly dull, dining space. It still serves real ale, with three reliable if unadventurous regulars (Fuller's London Pride, Greene King IPA and Adnam's broadside) joined by a guest ale, which this week was the very nice (and rare, in London) Harviestoun 'Bitter and Twisted', an blond beer coming in at 4.8% ABV. The menu (and I haven't yet eaten here, so can't comment on the quality) also divides between bar and restaurant. The oddly-named 'Bar Snacks' menu features meals rather than snacks - soup at \u00a33.50, a Ploughman's lunch at \u00a36.50 and a selection of pies, mushy peas and mash at \u00a311.50. Hot food is only available at lunchtime. I'm less impressed that a 12.5% service charge is added in the bar - perhaps a sign of restaurant-management thinking. The restaurant, on the other hand, is much more what you'd expect: starters from \u00a36.75 to \u00a39.25, including scallops, potted duck, snails, steak tartare, fresh salmon and risotto; soups and salads from \u00a36.50 to \u00a38.25; and mains - all restrained modern British fare- range between \u00a310 and \u00a320, with side dishes are around \u00a33 and puddings at \u00a36. The wine list has plenty of variety - ranging from \u00a313.50 to a selection in the \u00a3100+ bracket, so you should find something to suit your taste and pocket. Again, a service charge of 12.5% is added, so expect a two-course meal with wine to cost around \u00a350 a head. The restaurant seemed very popular, judging by the constant arrival and disappearance upstairs of a stream of generally well-heeled diners. A few quibbles, however: the menu has, rather oddly, a separate 'Crustacea' section, which is slightly too biological for my liking, when 'shellfish' would suffice. (They could go the whole hog, I suppose, and go for a menu headed 'flora, herbivora, ave and icthyes'. Or maybe not). And the development of the restaurant has changed the atmosphere somewhat, from the local pub it was to a slightly more varied and, it has to be said, more pretentious crowd, although the atmosphere was still welcoming enough. Overall, it's worth a look inside, with a pint or two",

We didn't realise we were in a Ramsey's Gastro pub until we looked at the bar menu.I had low hopes for the food as I thought it was simply a nice looking pub, which have all to often tricked me into thinking the food will match the decor. Once we had seen Ramsey's name gracing the menu I was reminded of the ready meal scandal mentioned below, and luckily so. We ordered a cheese plate as a tester, with the potential to order food later if the cheese went well.10/15 minutes later our small plate of British Cheeses with a few crackers arrived. It looked interesting but I can honestly say I had never before encountered sweaty plate of cheese. Every cheese was wet and limp looking which worried us but we tried it regardless thinking Ramsey might know something we didn't. But after a mouthful each we could see it just didn't taste right. The fact the wait staff didn't notice \u00a0how sweaty and awful the cheeses looked was a surprise, as was their indifferent response when we pointed it out.When the plate was replaced it was fine and clearly a fresh plate of cheese. All the cheeses were nice enough but only one or two stood out more than the small portion of each cheese.This said service was charming in places and it is a beautiful pub so i would go back for drinks (maybe) but doubt I would pay Ramsey prices for another potentially disappointing meal.",

Ramsay doesn't own it anymore, but the food is still decent (what you'd expect from a normal pub) and the drinks are cheaper than at the close-by Elgin!",

    "text": "So we're on vacation now and I want the REAL English/British experience. My friend insisted we have a traditional Sunday Roast. My friend says that Sunday roast, obviously only on Sunday's, but it's usually a very LARGE Sunday brunch typically with potatoes and Yorkshire pudding and some type of meat and gravy. It's like dinner for breakfast.We first initially tried to eat elsewhere but it shut down! Well, not too far away was this location, The Warrington.(It is also a Hotel mind you. So I'll only be speaking on the bar/restaurant.)Located in a very nice neighborhood. REALLY nice. Within walking 20 feet down the street, I crossed 3 Porsches and 1 Range Rover. The houses are 3-4 stories high with freshly manicured topiaries. Anyways, as soon as you walk in you're welcomed to a large, ornate lounging and dining area with dark wood furniture. Very beautiful and antique feeling as if not much had been changed over the past century, everything just looks so intricate.Back to, Sunday roast! You choose either chicken, pork, or beef. I ordered beef. Let me tell you, this was the best breakfast ever. Two generous slices of roast beef atop a bed of a variety of roasted potatoes, saut\u00e9ed kale and Yorkshire pudding all slathered with a warm brown gravy. Honestly, I could have had more and could eat this every Sunday if at all possible. My other friend ordered a Ni\u00e7oise salad which I just learned is a traditional French dish that has Tuna, hard-boiled egg and olives. I didn't try it but the presentation was just as beautiful and she said just as delicious.",

Room was fine - clean, but not as luxurious as appeared in pictures on their site. For $240 a night, expected slightly more. Additionally, housekeeping did not visit my room although I was assured they would. This was disappointing. Breakfast in the pub (a la carte) was quite nice, though difficult to navigate with a gluten allergy. All in all, a fine stay, though I will probably try a different spot on my next trip",

The rooms are all unique and they must have been recently remodeled because they are super modern! Our good friends had recommended the Warrington and we are super grateful. We did not know the history of this place until we arrived. The authentic and original bar on the first floor is super cute. Apparently this place use to be a brothel back in the 1800's for nobility and is the place where the term \"randy\" was coined (the hotel sits on Randy Street)!You should note that there is no safe in the room. There is no \"do not disturb\" sign to put up. There are only like 5 rooms so be sure you pick the one you want! \u00a0Just remember if you are coming back to your room after 1am, the bar entrance in the front is closed so walk around to the back and the electronic piece on the room key will get you in. We were a little worried that it might be loud at night but it totally wasn't! The bar is on the first floor and the rooms are all on the third floor so we didn't hear anything at night. There is no elevator so you will have to carry your luggage up the stairs to the third floor, but it is manageable. \u00a0The only thing we did not like was the breakfast. There are tons of good eateries in walking distance that you can enjoy. We walked to the river and walked to the train station which is only a few blocks away. The location is pretty convenient!This place is like a hidden gem!! If you come across this as an option for your stay in London, definitely consider it!",

Not surprisingly, it is always very busy and I have never managed to secure a seat! Luckily there is seating available outside!Great emphasis is placed on gourmet food, as The Warrington is a Gordon Ramsay establishment!This is a truly outstanding pub full of character and a must see!",

I sat down on a messy table and after a good 15' wait, I had to ask a waiter if he could clean. He took the dishes and left the table just filthy. I had to go and ask for a towel to clean it up myself. Fine. It happens. I am not mad at a waiter if he/she is a bit distracted once but then comes the food. A piece of dry, overcooked meat with a bunch of veggies thrown together is not what I call a burger. \u00a0All the people that work in here are nice. The just seem very disoriented all together. The dessert was OK. This pub seems to have a reputation but it doesn't meet the standards of the most average pub in London.It's definitely out of my list.",

We promptly found a few seats and a lady customer greets us with \"do I know you?\" with a snooty look just because our eyes happened to meet when we were looking for seating (what great hospitality from the community). After looking at the menu and being ready to order drinks and food, we had decided to wait about 20 minutes and hadn't seen ONE employee!!! No one behind the bar, no server, no Busser. After the 20 minutes we finally saw someone emerge from behind the bar and helped customers that arrived much later than us. At this point we got up and left! This place is lucky that they can't get anything less than a star because start to finish, the service and customer atmosphere is rubbish!",

I wanted to get a pudding but I didn't dare in case it was as bad as the main. My friend ordered a burger it was also quite mediocre. Expensive food for what it was.
