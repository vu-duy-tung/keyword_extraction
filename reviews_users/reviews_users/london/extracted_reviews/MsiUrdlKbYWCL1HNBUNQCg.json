The food arrived. I had ordered chicken tikka masala and it was rather bland but I chalked it up to them catering to a western audience (I am Indian). Then my order of Fish fry came along and it was cold and tough as leather which indicated it was probably old. When the waiter/manager came along to ask how things were I pointed out that the fish fry was cold and tough and uneatable he said \"That's how fish fry is and if you want something else you can order separately\". My girlfriend wanted to protest but I didn't want to spoil our night further and paid and left. I am not only Indian but I have organized two yoga tours of India taking people from the US around various parts of India so for someone to try and pass off spoiled food as \"that's how it is supposed to be\" just left me astounded. We certainly will not be going anywhere near this place during our next trip to London.",

Even though it was Southern Indian food and not the indian food like I'm used to (naan, tikka masala), I was thoroughly impressed. Thanks to recs, we tried the lamb puffs- AMAZING! The sauce that came with it was like a spicy ketchup and complimented it perfectly :) Then we split an order of the lamb dish with chillies, coconut rice and pranatha. Good portions and and an even better price- it came out to around 23 pounds, which is super cheap. Totally recommend! Go out of your comfort zone, it's totally worth it",

So one night I went to Rasa W1, to taste their kind of Indian cooking.The best was their mixed poppadom etc. plate for starter. Mostly, you just get one or mode poppadoms (and almost every Indian restaurant write it differently anyway) with the usual chutneys. Here you get a selection of normal poppadom, some special poppadom, some tasty crunchy sticks, and some other thing. With the usual chutneys, but also with some lemon chutney or pickle, what I haven't tasted before. The main then was okay, could have been a bit more meat, but besides that, it really tasted good. They also offer a special pancake as side \u00a0it sounded good and I was curious, so I went for that instead of plain naan. The pancakes, called appam, were really good. Very different from naan bread, but also a good supplement to finish the delcious masala sauce.The mango lassi also turned out to be a good choice.The problem began, when I wanted to order a dessert. If you don't like bananas and raisins, the dessert menu becomes quite short. I wanted to try a special sort of Indian ice cream. Unfortunately, they did not have that this evening. I don't go to an Indian restaurant, to eat just normal ice cream, so I left without a dessertsad ending for a otherwise good dinner.The only thing, I really did not like, is the colour scheme. And maybe music.",

    "text": "Ok so.. First things first:do you remember last time you went to an indian restaurant? Ok take everything you remember from that experience and throw it away, as this is NOT the usual indian. It's Kerala cuisine! Much more similar to Tamil/Sri-lanka food than to Rajasthan!You will understand the difference from the very beginning: more flavored, with bananas, coconut, lots of fresh cardamom, different types of curry.. Take a minute and try to understand the different flavors you find in every bite: amazing uh!Anyway, speaking more in particular about the place: it's pink, SERIOUSLY PINK. I call it (in italian at least!) \"ancient pink\", I'm not aware of any actual translation... Anyway, the restaurant is developed on two floors and it's quite small: that means that it will be crowded and noisy, please don't bring your date here (as I saw today....)! Bring your friends or your at-least-two-or-better-three-years-partner here and have fun!We took the non-vegetarian menu: a set of flat bread/dry bananas with sauces (awesome sauces!!), a starter composed by three pieces, lamb puff, chicken samosa and fried prawn (please don't ask me the exact names!), and an assortment of main dishes, chicken, lamb, fish, potatoes and rice (something like a biryiani), and a small dessert to close everything, the classical rice pudding (if I remember well it's called kheer...).Damn! this food is good!! I mean, it's not simply good (maybe not for everybody.. it's hot! but well if you don't like spicy food why the hell you are in an indian restaurant!?!?) but it's INTERESTING: As I said before, try to think about what you're eating at every bite, it's simply unbelievable! wonderful raw products and with a lot of experience in mixing them in a terrific result! That\u00ecs why I'm suggesting the menu, so that you can actually taste the highest number of different plates in a single meal!Just a bad side-note: they were a bit slow (but that's ok, it's saturday night!) and I hate to pay for white rice in indian restaurants usually rice is for free! but anyway totally recommended, come \u00a0and discover a new state of India and its wonderful flavors!!",

He basically picked our dinners with some minor input and we definitely didn't regret it.The appetizers were really special. Try the banana boli!! It was sweet but had a great peanut sauce. :-D",

And it's often done poorly. Luckily, this was not an issue at Rasa. In fact, I want to bathe in the sauce used in the basar baingan (a dish of fried aubergine in a creamy cashew, yogurt, and chili base). Please feed this to me every day (and watch me get really fat.

    "text": "I am one of those who complains all the time about how UK does not have any authentic Indian restaurants but well, err, I guess Rasa has made me finally shut up! I was quite literally bowled over by the menu as they had some very unique south Indian dishes which even I had not tried before. India is such a massive country that it is pretty much impossible to try all Indian dishes even when you are an Indian (Yes there is a lot more to Indian cuisine than curries). Rasa has several branches around London (sadly not in Manchester yet... *sigh*), I went to the one near Bond Street for a work dinner. We were 15 of us so you can imagine the amount of food we ordered, I can safely say we pretty much ordered more than half the menu (which means I get to try a little bit of everything -- yay!). We commenced our meal with a starter platter which included aloo tikki, wadas, fish cakes and prawns along with a plate full of chutneys --- yummm (not saying anything more). For mains we ordered Dosa, Aubergine curry in a cream sauce, coconut rice, chicken madras curry and many more (pardon me for not remembering the names of 10 dishes) and all of them tasted absolutely delicious and very authentic. For all you people who know Bollywood stars, Aishwaria Rai (ex miss world) has visited this place several times (saw it on their website -- :D). The pricing is not sky high either, rather I would say it is very affordable compared to other London restaurants. Verdict : Definitely going back when I visit London next and I hope they open a branch in Manchester soon (Rasa -- are you listening?)",

One of the best I've ever had. Kappayum Meenum - Tasty spicy fish dish. Remember to order a side of their coconut rice to go along with it. You won't regret it. Overall, Rasa might not be the fanciest Indian restaurant in London, but the food here is solid and tasty! I'd recommend making a reservation first since it gets packed quickly during dinner hours.",

We also ordered the Konju Manga Curry and Seafood Starter. It's definitely different from any Indian place I've tried but I'm still coming out of my American shell and making sure to order things other than the Chicken Tikka Masala ;) \u00a0Both curry dishes (I think they were both curry) had incredible flavours. Sweet and subtle but nice hints of savoury from the shrimp. Both were also very different. The Beet option was the most unique and I really enjoyed it. I could have done without the starter but it was interesting to try the multiple items. The prantha though... holy crap that was amazing! It's like a flatter more sweet naan. We both gobbled it down.

A cute, pink, multi-storied establishment, you won't miss it when you are near it. The interior is nice and cozy, with a sleepy atmosphere - perhaps a tad too sleepy as the waiters were more than a bit slow. The food was delicious though. The menu is more South Indian, although you can definitely find tikka masala amongst the dishes. The curries were delicious and complex in flavour profile, while the breads (or starch) didn't disappoint. Leave some room in your stomach and round it out with one of their desserts. It is certainly hard to compete with all the other great Indian restaurants in this city, where even the flights serve curry onboard. Rasa doesn't disappoint and can definitely stand its own.",

Course #1: buncha' amazing chutneys served with crispy chips (mmmmmm ya, they were solid)Course #2 potato, plantain, aubergine fritters served with a chutney for each (least fav was the plantain, the aubergine with tomato chutney was great)Course #3 lil' bowls of greatness: mixed veggie curry, daal saag, mango yogurt (ah-may-zingggg) served with roti (paratha was a win), spiced potatoes Course #4 rice pudding (had a taste, but didn't eat the rest. Not their best work)Service was a little slow, as they were slammed and basically only had one waiter upstairs. Everyone was super nice tho. There was a bit of a lag between courses, but other than that, it was a great dining experience! I'd go back, no doubt.",

    "text": "Mediocre food, terrible service.We had a reservation for 7 p.m. and we were there right on time. We sat on the second floor (there's a weird spiral staircase to get up there) and placed our orders pretty quickly. I don't know if this is just standard for England, but rice isn't included with your dishes; you have to order it separately. We also asked for water. The waiter brought over sparkling water to pour in our glasses, but that's not what we wanted. I don't think you should assume people want sparkling water. We told him we wanted still, and he seemed really pissed and went back to the bar to get a bottle of still. I saw him putting down the glasses rather forcefully. Our appetizer came quickly; we got the selection of various fried starters. I thought the frying was heavy and nothing seemed particularly inspired, though the eggplant (tempura-style) was probably the best. The dish also had plantains, a lentil donut-type thing and a potato ball. Our entrees took FOREVER, about 45 minutes. The table next to us came later and got their food faster--they didn't order appetizers, but I still don't think they should be all the way through their main course before we even see a main course show up. The waiters never took any time to explain what was going on and seemed to avoid eye contact with us when they walked by. The food, when it finally came, was just fine. It lacked any hint of heat-- we understood it wouldn't be Indian-level spicy, but thought it would have something-- and came in pretty small portions. The best was probably the chicken biryani and the roti. Everything else just seemed rather uninspired: the chicken tikka masala, the fish curry and the spinach and lentil vegetarian dish. It was also very hard to see how any of these dishes could take that long to make. They tacked on a 12.5% service charge at the end, which seemed high, given their attitude problems and our interminable wait.",

    "text": "I had some friends visiting, and when Americans come, Indian is always a safe bet. Even the okay stuff goes over well with them. My usual go-to has recently had a menu overhaul (not in a good way), so I thought about trying out Rasa.We arrive. There's a ton of space which is nice, but not many people. Of course, it is a Tuesday night, so that may have something to do with it. But after careful consideration, we decide to go for the non-vegetarian feast (\u00a330 pp). And we order a bottle of red wine. Which turned out to be really good.The non-veggie feast started with snacks (poppadoms, banana chips plus more delicious goodies) and SIX chutneys. It was like being back in South India again. And they were all really good. The coconut and the lemon chutneys were my favorite. This is followed by some starters. You can also tell them what starters you're interested in, and one of my friends wanted the samosa and my partner wanted the lamb puffs, so we made sure to get those both. There was also a fried prawn. And a couple of really nice sauces.But then the feast arrived! FOUR different curries, two different rices, potatoes, paratha and chapati. Wow! It filled up the table. And it was really good. The potatoes were spicy. My partner said the paratha was better than usual (I get them quite a bit because I love them, and he always tries them). The curries were great. My favorite being the lamb and the spicy chicken. The fish curry had nice flavor, but the fish was slightly over cooked.The meal ended with some rice pudding. I loved the flavor. I think if I had a choice, I'd probably get a different dessert as the banana dosas sounded great. Speaking of dosas, the table next to us ordered them and they were huge. I'm definitely going to go back and try them.I loved my time at Rasa. Good food, good service and good company. I'll definitely be back and probably be bringing visitors who want some good South Indian food.",

    "text": "Ah- MA-ZING! \u00a0This was the best South Indian food I have ever eaten. \u00a0From the first bite (to the completely stuffed) last, I found myself humming and closing my eyes and saying \"mmm,\" through the whole meal.The menu is a little daunting for me because there is so much text. \u00a0I would have like to have taken it to the hotel to read a day before to understand all the great stories being told about the food, how the smells remind the author of one thing or the next from his childhood, etc. \u00a0But I didn't have that luxury. \u00a0It was 10pm on a Sat, I was starved and YELP said they closed at 10:30p. (Luckily, on Sat- they don't stop seating till 11pm).I am traveling alone and unlike many prix fixe menus I have seen around town, this one was not a min of 2 ppl. \u00a0So I ordered the \"Non Veg\" FEAST. \u00a0Here's what came with it:- Part 1: Pre-Meal- a basket of cruchies of all sizes, including savory banana chips. \u00a0All perfectly seasoned and delicious enough that I almost got full just snacking on those! \u00a0Also included was a small sampling of spicy pickles and a garlicy yogurt- Part 2: Appetizers - served with a small cucumber, carrot and lettuce bed, the apps were a lamb puff, chicken samosa (this was THE BEST SEASONED SAMOSA I HAVE EVER HAD) and a fried prawn. \u00a0The prawn was just at the right temp, not rubbery or overcooked. \u00a0The lamb was mixed with potato and a little bit dry- but compared to everything else- a small textural note.- Part 3: Mains- there were three curries- Chicken, lamb and fish- a large helping of lemon rice and a large pancake roti. \u00a0The fish seemed hard at first, but did not taste dry at all. \u00a0It tasted almost like it was compressed. \u00a0Not sure what fish it was, but it was wonderful. \u00a0The lamb was a solid curry in a dark sauce. \u00a0It was cooked perfectly. \u00a0The best of the three was the chicken curry. \u00a0This wasn't your average tikki masala, the seasoning was just spicy enough and went perfectly with the roti they included to mop up all the juices. \u00a0Before I could finish this part I was bordering on stuffed. \u00a0I couldn't resist noshing on more of it, so I barely left any behind. \u00a0Then I was truly stuffed. \u00a0and along came...Part 4: Dessert- this was a delicate tapioca rice porridge with hints of coconut, cardamon and little slices of cashews. \u00a0Unlike other tapioca that I have gotten to finish and Indian meal, this one really knew how to hint at spices without overpowering it. \u00a0Cardamon is a difficult spice to work with if its not toasted properly and (preferably for me) strained out rather than included whole. \u00a0They handled it perfectly.The service was spot on, I was visited several times, but not enough to feel intrusive. \u00a0There was an entertaining party sitting nearby, so I heard some fun conversations. \u00a0The only downside was the lack of wi-fi and spotty phone reception, or this review would have been posted while i ate.PS: I heard from the waiter that the cousin of the chef/ owner has a restaurant in Culver City on Venice Blvd. \u00a0He wrote down the info for me. \u00a0Now I have a place to check out when I get back to LA!",

I was flabbergasted.We ordered a bottle of wine 4-5 plates and our bill was \u00a360. We started with the lamb puff, which was shockingly good. Although this dish is typically a street food type of pastry, they way Rasa prepared it was elegant while retaining the best features of the dish. Superbly flavored lamb and a beautifully fluffy pastry texture. The kingfish curry was outstanding. Deep tomato sauce, but very well balanced. Kingfish was cooked perfectly and very fresh. We also ordered the Tikkhali curry, a vegetarian dish, but an amazingly rich, and creamy sauce. The paratha went was soft with a beautiful texture and went perfectly with the curries. Overall we had a tremendous dinner at Rasa and will definitely be returning soon!",
