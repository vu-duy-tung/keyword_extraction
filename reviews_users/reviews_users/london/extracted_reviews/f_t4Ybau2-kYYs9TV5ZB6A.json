After wanting to try out this place for ages, I recently made it here and, double espresso in hand, clambered up the stairs to the first floor area. I think it's great! Lots of antique sofas and tables, lots of kitsch, the music was 30s-50s, and I believe that they were playing Fred Astaire. I thought that my espresso was quite good and I know that I will be back but, after the lack of positive comments on the cakes, I think I will stick to drinking espresso.",

I must say that i don't think it can compete. The coffee is average and is overpriced for what it is. The downstairs is small and sometimes feels busy, even when there are not many customers purely because of the awkward shape of the bar. Upstairs is much nicer with a relaxed atmosphere and different, it somewhat tacky decor. If your in town then don't be gutted if you give this a miss, head down the road for a coffee instead. Totally average, very hoxton coffee place.",

I have been wanting to come in here for a while having passed it on numerous occasions on the way to or from Vietnamese food on Kingsland Road. From the outside you can see a cool bar with lots of coffee paraphernalia. I went in recently with a old friend visiting London. The downstairs looked nice, but we were given a pretty hard time when we tried to sit at the bar. We were told it was OK, but really they would much prefer us to sit upstairs. The staff then made it impossible to sit at the bar by continually putting dirty dishes from upstairs in front of us (OK so we really can't sit there say so at the start, and perhaps don't put chairs there). We went upstairs, and it was amazingly tripped out in a faux Art Deco/17th C coffee house sort of way. I have to say at first I was pretty impressed, but over time it sort of annoyed me. The paintings that covered every wall were, when you looked at them, pretty ugly and cheap looking, and the lamps while nice-ish, were not real art deco, but just sort of fake imitations. OK you say, what's the problem with all that? But I think it was the fakeness of it all that annoyed me. I felt like I was in some sort of themed coffee shop ; nothing that reflected the owners own feelings, but just something that was there to impress. It just sort of felt a bit like a weird Disneyland coffee experience. And perhaps just as importantly I found the coffee a little burnt, and over priced.",

He replaced it but continually told us we were out of order, shaking his head at us and saying that because of us he'd wasted a tea bag.

I walked past this place about a week ago and it had only been open a few days. It's was pouring down with rain and I peered though it's wonderful windows at the warm glow coming off the copper coffee pots. I begged and begged to go in but my partner in crime at the time dragged me on to the bus and I stared back at the orange lights as they faded into the distance. This time however I was alone and missed two buses just standing in the rain peering in. It looked so wonderful that I didn't want to go in and soil it by the place being bad. I can't tell you the relief I felt when I had my first sip of my fabulous mellow, deep, smooth, rich... coffee. I don't know if I told you but this place isn't a bar, it's a coffee house, a proper old skool hang out where you can chill out, relax and read a book, pen a novel or even just stare out the window and pass the time people watching. I can't even describe the decor, it was a cross between an old pub and someones sitting room. I'll upload some photos so you can see what I mean.I think their beans are Brazilian, and they are tasty too so you should come her and drink coffee. As I said this is a coffee house and unlike many others I have been too, this one is of a particular style yet it's not trying. It's just great, and it's doesn't need to try hard at all. They do have a selection of cakey cakes and sarnies but... I didn't try those, damn it, I'll have to come back.",

It is a small venue, so seating can be a challenge if you're looking to pop in a stay a while, but he told us that they will be opening the upstairs soon for seating -- in fact, according to the photos, it looks like it could be open now.

It's a tiny little place with seating for about 15. The walls are almost completely covered in kitsch prints and paintings, boxing gloves and old signs to Brick Lane. In the window and behind the counter are pieces of golden machinery- the espresso cup dispenser (pictured) and an old gramaphone give the place a real retro feel to it. Hot chocolate I had was delicious and the cream on the top was fresh and devine. My housemates' coffee was lovely and rich, they claimed. The owners are Italian (I believe) and introduced themselves to us and invited us to come back again (which we shall) which gave it the personal touch sometimes lacking in establishments. It's the sort of place you can imagine being a cover for a waterhole in a time of prohibition or something, although I think it only does coffee and no booze! Although with the array of syrups they had you could spend a twitchy afternoon trying out them all! I'd recommend it as a place to catch up with a small group of friends/family or perhaps a date of you can get a seat! Small but perfectly formed!",

The coffee and cake was good, but my real attraction to this place is the interior decorating & the ambience. I found myself playing with things in the bathroom (err...wall fixtures, weird looking hand dryers etc, not what you're thinking...!). The downstairs coffee bar is packed with retro gadgets and you really have to see it to appreciate just how well put together the experience is. Very cosy in a good way.And we haven't even got onto the main event, the pimping pink palace upstairs. The upstairs lounge accosts your senses at first glance, and doesn't relinquish it's hold very easily, you literally have to tear yourself away to get out of the place. A lavish pink Victorian esq lounge, for lounging in (what else), with delightfully soothing acoustic music. I've honestly not seen anything matching this place in London yet. I felt so immediately relaxed that I actually felt a strong yearning to curl up and drift off to a blissful power nap against the dreamy background music on one of the large pink couches. \u00a0Just take my advice, try it out.

    "text": "Popped in on a freezing cold Saturday afternoon to warm up with a coffee and was not disappointed! Loved the downstairs counter area where you order; long polished dark wood bar, walls heaving with old photographs and memorobilia and the cabinet of cakey-goodness.There's no particular era the owners seem to love, more an eclectic mix of everything they think is cool. Some of the pieces I spied: leather boxing gloves, bagpipes, gilt mirrors and victoriana, old radios behind the bar, glorious coffee machines, leadlight lampshades and classic movie posters.Yes, it was a bit pricey, but loved the feeling of being in a '30s Manhattan cawfee shop.Then we went upstairs to the first floor dining area. Basically, they've shoved as many regency chairs and chesterfield sofas in there as will fit, decorated with floaty, sheer fabric and strange lamps. I liked the fact that it was cozy and quirky - sure beats the sterile Starbucks-esque environment of other coffee houses.Coffee was great but sadly my millefeuille was a little dry and a tad overpriced for what it was. If cakes seemed a little fresher I'd go for 5 stars.I think I'd love to go back here for a coffee now and again just to enjoy the atmosphere - anywhere that plays Ella Fitzgerald gets my vote.",

    "text": "Judging by the reviews, this place seems to be the coffee house equivalent of Marmite: you either love it or you hate it! I'm in the former school of thought. I loved the quirky, vintage decor of the bar once I walked in, but the upstairs seating area just blew me away. It's so crazy, it's wonderful. The staff were really nice and friendly as well, and checked on me several times even though I chose to sit upstairs, right by the front window (i.e. the furthest from the staircase). The coffee and cake I had, however, weren't fantastic. I had the server's favaourite - a strawberry tart - and for the price, expected something far better than what I got, but I figure they've got to pay for the antiques somehow. I mean, the decor can't be cheap. That being said, I do like the place. Like the previous reviewer meneer said, it's very Shoreditch, but I mean that as the highest of compliments. It's quirky, it's got character, it's memorable and it's relaxing. Just don't come in here if you're on your last few pennies!",

Ok, the upstairs could also be called major twee as well, or described as the patterns section of a fabric store barfing over an antiques shop, but it just worked well, with so much seating and so much style. And the idea that at 9PM on a Saturday night you can sit down somewhere near Old Street, and talk without having to strain your voice over loud music, being stared at by proprietors to drink or move on already, or deal with an alcoholic ambience, is just great.And The Bridge did not serve me hot water and a dry biscuit. They served me delicious hot chocolate with tons of whipped cream and cheesecake with strawberries. You bet me and my friends stayed until closing time. I'd move to Shoreditch for this.",

It's got great coffee, table service, reasonable prices, and the most wonderful atmosphere you can imagine. Their pastries aren't bad either. They've got this cozy attic done up like an old crazy grandma's sitting room. Lots of antique looking chairs with funny old style paintings in extravagant frames covering the walls. Really cool, too bad it's been getting more and more popular since it opened and it can get hard to find a seat : (",

It feels like you're teleported into a bar in a rural part of America, that's brandishing it's owners travellers trinkets on the wall like a dusty 3D wallpaper.As you walk into this beautifully retro American themed bar, you're greeted by an assortment of antiques and bizarre bits and bobs that fill the walls and reminded me of some of the bars in America during my travels. Honestly you could look for hours when you explore the several rooms tucked away in this maze of a bar. From obscure to retro, classic to neon lights and signs. Every inch of this place is covered in stuff, but not in a cluttered way somehow. The lighting in here is awesome too, with the neon lights giving off eery colour and some old school lights giving off a moody glow, it's relaxing and easy on the eyes in here.Take a ganders upstairs and there's an adorable room designed for small groups to gather around small tables and talk the night away on vintage victorian seats. This place is honestly the coolest bar I've been to in London in terms of unique styling.They also serve food here but I didn't try it so cannot comment. Though it's not the usual selection of pub food but more of a cafe - and Turkish themed at that.This place is a cafe, a coffee shop and bar rolled into one. It has an awesome atmosphere and isn't crazy expensive either. I paid just over a tenner for a double cointreau and coke, which is standard for london.But for the experience? Too good. Gather your friends, organise an event, go for a drink and enjoy the experience of this time capsule cafe/bar/thingy.Cash only.",

    "text": "To quote Winston Churchill \"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.\"As I rest my fingers on the dull black qwerty keyboard, I thought of these wise words from W.C. when contemplating my review for The Bridge. It's a drizzly unusually chilly Wednesday evening in London. I'm rushing passed the lazy hipster walkers blocking my path as I exit Old Street station heading towards Hoxton steadfastly. Per usual, I'm running 7 minutes behind schedule and most likely my friends will be waiting for my arrival silently with impatience. My body temperature is increasing as I scurry through the corner of Old St and Kingsland Rd internally indicating that my body will require an extra beer to compensate for this amount of caloric burning. Parched and yearning for my first humpday sip of crisply carbonated bottled beer, I quickly apologize for my late arrival and we all enter The Bridge.Instantly I'm transported into the 1920s with gaudy statue replicas, dark red velvet inner lining and dim lighting coming from sources unseen. Following the instructions from the muscular and slightly difficult to comprehend barman, I walked with anticipation to the cooler compartment filled with an average yet satisfactory selection of mainstream and local brands of beer. Reaching for an IPA unknown to me, I offered to pay in exchange for my delayed arrival.Oh... but what lies here in an artificially lit glass display yearning for my attention?? Seeing the syrupy glimmer emanating from a large sheet of lumpy golden brown flakes, I immediately knew that before me stood a glorious army of baklava! How marvellous, my stomach quickly noted to my brain via quick electric impulses. However, just as fast as the baklava revelation took hold to my eyes, they quickly looked south to see a see of flaky flat sandal shaped pastries. \"Are these bourek?\", I ask the good man cutting slices of red velvet cake behind the dark wood counter.\"Why yes! Let us know what you would like and we'll bring it upstairs to you\", kindly replied this Ottoman-food knowledgeable gentlemen.Longing for that crispy and slightly oily sensation of biting into a virgin bourek, I placed a requisition for a meat bourek. With a slight look of apprehension, the now nervous man carefully yet secretively examined the meat bourek. After his investigation, I was told that there are no meat boureks and that I must settle for one with cheese. The easygoing flexible food lover in me quickly complied although the seed of scepticism for this establishment began to sprout with images of a possibly expired and fuzzy bourek. \"That'll be \u00a322.50 please!\" Exclaimed the Turkish Adonis of a barman. Admittedly I was thrown back by the high price for but a mere two bottles of beer, cola and bourek, but often times for quality, one must pay. Regrettably, after some masterful pan frying of the bourek it arrived at our lovely Victorian style table upstairs as I was finishing the 4th sip of my IPA brew. The bourek was severed into several pieces but more note worthy was the inappropriately placed mounds of ketchup, mustard, pickles and unidentifiable substance drowning in what I could guess to be mayonnaise. With heavy reluctance at the sore sight before my eyes, I precariously placed a portion of the triest limp bourek into my mouth.Sour...Why???I could not fathom the sour taste that was thrust upon me. Had I not had an appetite, I would not have taken another bite. As unfortunate as it is with the splendid and almost grandiose furniture and ambiance of this interesting establishment on Kingsland Rd, I am not able to justify another visit based on beverage prices, selection, and very questionable bar nibblets. As the famous quote of Winston Churchill wisely illustrates, although this establishment proved to be a failure, my enthusiasm for drinking and eating (albeit in other establishments) have not diminished in the slightest!! And as many wise Yelpers would say, \"come here for the ambiance and not for the food and drink\"",

More fool me, I love The Bridge. And I love the old school looking robot-like gold and silver twin coffee machines more.The decor is pretty manly downstairs, all dark wood with old school posters and sporting memorabilia downstairs; but venture upstairs and you find jewel coloured armchairs and drapes.Coffees were good and the pastries and muffins were pretty, but I really want to come back and make the most of the alcohol licence, get myself tipsy and pretend I'm Alice in Wonderland and make myself at home upstairs.",

    "text": "Its an interesting spot but also a little weird. We wanted a chilled place for a drink. When we walked in it was all eyes on us, slightly intense. A turkish type cafe downstairs is your welcome. When we were taken by two separate people to the cute victorian lounge upstairs, i was intrigued by the decor but concerned by the hygiene. Everything is old and stained. My allergies kicked in with sneezing, but if you can move on beyond that, its not bad. Cute, quiet and a bit of a sanctuary away from crazy Shoreditch High St. Two negatives to note is that they don't take cash which only volunteer after you order and receive your drinks. I am always suspicious about place like that as in this day age EVERYWHERE takes card, even the farthest, quietest villages. So why not a central bar right in the middle of East London's drinking and eating hub. Next is the service, quite cold. They hover and once they tell you how much you owe, they stand over the table like a club bouncer expecting a fight. For \u00a313 you won't get any hassle from this little romantic couple outing mate. I am hoping that this was a one off bad service and vibe visit, as the place is waaayy cute, the pricing was right an its a welcome break from the noisy licenses establishments just down the road.",

This is a great place to take your friends or colleagues for intimate meetings or catchups and is nice and quiet in the earlier part of the day.",

Now I'm not one to put a bad review down based on one experience and I've now tried (suffered) here three times at different times of the day.To say it's pretentiously average is the best compliment I can give. Eclectic shabby style over substance.Expensive, cold coffee with spray cream, one toilet (give me a break) no payment by card and staff attitude that may be \"trendy\" but just smacks of contempt for customers in my book.If you want shabby eclectic chic with a cool laid back attitude, go to the Spread Eagle.",

The decor, the people and the vibe are all epic.This is a Cypriot bar that oozes creativity. When you enter you feel like you've gone back in time and you've landed in the age of Marion Antoinette. There are random trinkets placed everywhere. The whole area is welcoming and friendly.But I implore you to go upstairs. There is nowhere more bohemian in London!",
