Quick service, excellent food, and they were also understanding when we realised it was cash-only, letting us pop out to get money after we'd ordered. I opted for the salad with a side of chips (an attempt at being only a little unhealthy?), and was pleasantly surprised when I got a plate heaped with veggies and cheeses with a delicious oil dressing on top - oh, and some top-notch chips! My colleagues also got pizzas and burgers, and said these were wonderful (and they looked delicious!). I'll be back again to try the pizza because they all raved about it, and I'm very happy to know they serve lunches quickly. (So no stress about getting back to the office in time for that 2pm meeting!)",

The pizzas are the centerpiece of the experience here.. crispy Italian style crust, with a clean tasting sauce and quality toppings like rocket, italian parma ham, feta, etc. \u00a0Side salads are creative, their tiramisu was heavenly, and they have other options for those who are all pizza'd out (like veg lasagna). \u00a0They also offer some cheap breakfast specials, like a free croissant with coffee and a sausage baguette/BLT. \u00a0Considering their pizzas are a mere 6 pounds, you can't do much better in the area for lunch (and yes, this is much better than Icco!)",

So it was a very refreshing experience to go out for a meal in Soho and spend less than \u00a320. All pizzas at Soho Joe are \u00a310, and they're absolutely huge. They make Pizza Express pizzas look like crudities. I had a Diavolo pizza which was gorgeous - \u00a0it may be the first pizza I've had trouble finishing, only because it was so massive. It's been a long time since I've had something that huge. The atmosphere is buzzy and fun, perfect for a night out. My only small complaint would be that you need to go to the counter to order your food, I am a bit of a snob, I do like waiter service. But I can easily excuse that for the delicious pizzas, great atmosphere and incredible prices.",

The toppings were okay and, commendably, it wasn't showered in cheese. The problem however was that the thin-crust base quite simply wasn't cooked. Throw in a tragicomically blunt knife and and most of the time I was skating across the pizza rather than slicing it. Really, I should have sent it back, but such was my fatigue and tight schedule that I didn't have the time, settling for bemusement and mild indigestion instead.Obviously this kind of issue is solveable, and another time I'll happily wait the extra 30-60 seconds for the base to cook. But with zillions of other cheap eat places to satisfy culinary cravings in Soho, returning to Soho Joe isn't currently top of my list.",

But a month has marched on and let's face it, now if you're a new restaurant and you don't have a Twitter feed constantly updated, you are nothing, nobody and going nowhere. But it's also true that people on the internet don't know jack about anything and still blather on regardless. Not that I'd know anything about that, ahem. What they fail to realise is that Soho Joe is just average. Yes, admittedly it looks funky with its pavement seating and open pizza kitchen. Very med inspired. But inside is distinctly canteen eating. The 'any pizza for \u00a36' offer will draw you in, and fill you up. The array of fresh salads will tempt you. The bottles of wine chilling on the counter will suddenly make your throat dry. But the too close together tables, tourist children coughing in my ear (\u00a36 pizzas + central London, you do the math) and the fact that you must order and pay at the counter make for an unimpressive experience for me. Fine for lunch, pass on by for dinner.",

From the outside the place looks a little run down and the menu some what plain - centred on pizza and a few burgers. Recently they introduced a wagyu beef burger and I was lucky enough to attend the launch night with my boyfriend.We were greeted by Mrs Joe herself and I was pleased to see they had created a lovely atmosphere - no harsh lights, plenty of candles and flowers on the table etc. At 6 o'clock there were a few people already seated however there was a nice buzz from them, waiters and the kitchen.We were instantly brought Prosecco which was continuously topped up throughout our meal by friendly waiters. To start we were bought 2 small pizzas to share (spicy pepperoni and basil & tomato). They were nice to nibble on while we waited as we were starving and they tasted good but were nothing special.Our wagyu mains were brought out to us after 20 minutes or so and were presented nicely on a wooden board. A huge burger, tin of chips and a few slices of steak. Alongside this they served the beer the Welsh cows are given everyday (along with a massage!) which was a nice idea - and tasty! For once the brioche bun was good! Buttery, toasted and fluffy (normally my main issue is the buns). The beef burger was also very tasty however a little dry and definitely needed some homemade sauce. It was stuffed full of tomato, lettuce and red onion which I liked as it gave a fresh, crunchy something however my boyfriend didn't like it and was desperate for some cheese (always an added extra).The chips were a huge disappointment - really terrible - and normally \u00a33 extra on top of the burger made for a total rip off at then nearly \u00a315 for a burger and chips. Luckily we were also given 2 perfectly cooked strips of wagyu beef which were also really well seasoned. All in all it was a nice enough meal with good service. It is never going to be 5* but for 4* there are a few easy wins they need to sort out!",

You would be fooled by the appearance of this place to think it was another pizza pasta bog standard, uninspiring eatery but you would be wrong. First of all it has a very relaxed atmosphere where you feel you can talk to a friend as loud as you like and about any subject with the feeling no one on the next table is listening in on your conversation. They also do an array of excellent healthy salads and serve alcohol at a reasonable price, about \u00a314 for a bottle of house red. But for me I love the grilled breakfasts that can be had.The humble British fry up seems to have fallen out of fashion in recent years but they do a fantastic one here and if I remember it comes with a drink. What I like about it is that Joe has done the grill up much as if you where doing at home. Gone are the cheap sausages and bacon and aluminous surgery ketchup you would be served in a greasy spoon and in come the quality Cumberland sausages and non cheap bacon, thickly cut crusty bread and Heinz red sauce. All done for the price of what you'd pay on a greasy spoon less than a fiver.",

I used to cringe whenever a client ordered a pizza from here, as the wait time is often long, and good luck trying to get anyone to pick up the phone in there. The staff (during lunchtime) can be abrupt to the point of rude, but that is where the negative review ends.Their pizzas are out of this world. They are thin and crispy, laden down with toppings, and oozy, without being soggy. Their pizzas defy the laws of physics. I don't know how they do it.If you have some time to kill during your lunch in Soho, I'd thoroughly recommend it. If you're in a rush, avoid. They do \u00a35 pizzas on a Tuesday. What's not to like?",

The prices are slightly higher than others and the cash only aspect annoys me. Cash only, really? It's London! Plus, pay your taxes...If you time your visit badly, you might have to wait a while. Thankfully it is on a busy and social street so finding a bar is not difficult.",

    "text": "Soho is now my new favourite place to eat when I'm in London. This was the 2nd pizza place we found that served really great pizzas for a pretty good price. Different in so many ways to Franco Manca, including the type of pizza served, though (in my opinon) not quite as good it's still definitely worth a visit.This place was JUMPIN' when we arrived. We saw a queue at their strange, meat fridge-esque flappy doors but luckily only waited a few minutes before being shown a rather small table in the middle of the room. We had to squeeze past a few folk to get seated & it was very much a case of once seated DO NOT MOVE! But we had to as we found out this restaurant takes a tip from the Nando's book where to order you have to go up to the counter and then also pay up front. Another note is it's CASH ONLY, which can be a tad annoying, but as long as you know that before heading all is cool. The waitress who seated & another who served me weren't the most amiable of waitresses...but as I said, it was VERY busy so I put that down to the fact they were probably a bit stressed, still politeness & smiles don't take too much effort...They were however a lot friendlier upon us leaving but by that point the place had quietened down a lot, so I think we just hit this place at rush hour.I ordered the Diavola pizza and my boyfriend had a Burger with chips. I also ordered a bottle of beer (Corona) and a soft drink. The prices were pretty good, especially for central London. Our bill came to under \u00a330. The food came speedily and as soon as my pizza arrived my boyfriend regretted ordering the burger! It was a mighty fine, 12\" pizza with a beautiful thin base and really generous, delicious toppings. It was pre-cut which I liked so that meant I could go all 'Noo Yoik' and eat it with my hands, although if you're more of the formal type they provide cutlery too. I tried some of the chips & burger & that was also really nice but I think when you're dining in Soho Joe's you NEED to get the pizza. Duh.Upon looking around I noticed the cocktails here were very popular. I'm guessing the prices for them were good for London, but me not being from here I thought they were still a bit pricey...I'll stick with the reasonably priced beer thank you. It was quite noisy and dark (candlelit) in here and our table was a bit too wee for the size of plate I had so had to be careful I didn't knock my drink over or burn anything on the candle (I am a bit clumsy though...) When we were leaving it emptied out and it was a lot nicer/quieter and had a more chilled atmosphere so I imagine the feeling of this place very much depends on at what time/day you visit. For all the wee niggles I had with SJ's I still really liked it & I would visit again.",

Although, I found my burger to be quite appetizing and it wasn't overdone at all and lightly seasoned chips to compliment my meal.The workers were very friendly even when it started to get busy. The area and tables are well kept and clean. I would recommend getting one of their 12\" pizzas for only \u00a36.50, a good deal.",

I didn't believe such a thing existed, but Soho Joe is there to prove me wrong.I turned up to see some friends who had already ordered some pizzas to take out. \u00a0Next thing I know a beer has been put in front of me - apparently you get a free beer while you wait. \u00a0That was a good start. \u00a0The pizzas are \u00a312, so very reasonably priced. \u00a0I ordered the Soho Joe Special, which had aubergine, artichoke, parma ham and other stuff. \u00a0It was a decent classic italian style thin crust pizza. \u00a0All the ingredients were cooked perfectly, and I liked how the ingredients were just draped over the pizza without too much care for making each slice equal. \u00a0Being italian style, most the pizzas were various combinations of parma ham, pepperoni and vegetables. \u00a0Don't expect anything like a meat feast.The staff are all really friendly and chatty. \u00a0The decor is bohemian chic, so the same as pretty much everywhere else. \u00a0We got our pizzas before we even finished our beers. \u00a0Then we went down to soho square to eat in the sun. \u00a0Would definitely go back!",

What makes this place fairly unique in soho is that the food quality is great considering the very very fair price. The first time I came here I got the bacon and egg baguette, which for \u00a33.50 was fantastic. Two full eggs and a couple of really tasty full slices of bacon in a freshly made warm bread. Mmm. The second time I got the Parma ham, mozzarella and basil ciabatta, which for \u00a33 was similarly awesome. \u00a0The full dishes (pizza, burgers, pasta etc) looked great on the table next to me and are again very well priced - I must try them next time.Keep it up Soho Joes - you're honest approach to eating out in central sets you apart!",

The food is great, especially those small, cute pizzas that always come just enough to fill me up. Joe's Special pizza is the star of the menu and it's quite frankly the one that comes really close to my heart as a favourite. They also offer a small variety of salads, pasta and sandwiches so there's something for everyone.",

The food is Italian with an emphasis on pizza (HUGE portions). It is dimly-lit and buzzing, making it a great place to get together with friends or for a date. The food was very good and the value was excellent. Mains averaged \u00a310 and they had very reasonably priced wine on offer. Service was great. I would say if you're looking for a fun spot before a night out that won't break the bank, this should be your go-to.",

As ever you need to bring cash and order inside rather than at the table but as long as you know that, it's fine. We had club ciabattas and they were delicious. The prosecco was reasonably priced. You don't have too much interaction with the staff, though they were pleasant. Be warned though, if someone is not eating or drinking they'll normally call you out on this. They've done it to us before and I saw them do it to someone on Thursday. I highly recommend it though and particularly for breakfast or lunch where you can get some good deals.",

    "text": "A top notch place to go before a night out in Soho. Why? Because unlike it's many neighbours, it's quite cheap, fairly cheerful, and will offer you a selection of foods and booze to get you started.Soho Joe's is primarily a pizza place and while the prices have gone up from the \u00a36/pizza they used to offer, at \u00a39 for a pizza the size of a very large dinner plate it's a pretty good deal. They have about 8 or 9 pizzas on the menu ranging from the traditional to some quirky creations. I loved the chorizo topped one with its rich spiciness although there was a bit too much oil from the cheese and chorizo to make it perfect. We had another one that was essentially a bruschetta pizza with pancetta - light and tasty with just enough salty meat flavour to make it filling. The others (a Diablo and something else) were also good but didn't stick out in my mind nearly as much.It was a bit of a let down that they didn't have some of the other main menu items as I had originally had my heart set on a lasagne. At 7pm, I wasn't expecting them to say they had run out, but maybe they only make a dish for the day.As far as drinks, the house wine is pretty spot on and they have a full bar more or less. They also offer ranges of fairly cheap shots (tequila was on offer that day) if you are gearing up for a big one.This is a CASH ONLY place so make sure to hit the cashpoint prior to getting stuck in. You can reserve tables but they usually also have space for walk ins so don't let that stop you. Overall, I enjoyed my time at Soho Joe's and will keep it in mind next time I'm in the area.",

I found out they only take cash, no cards. We then ordered the bargain \u00a37 12\" pizza \"Four Cheese\" flavour (me) and he had the burger and chips for \u00a38. Both were lovely and we were really pleased with our food and we shared a bottle of red too for \u00a316. What I liked to when I asked for some tap water was they directed to over to the side of the till where jugs of cold water are awaiting for you to take them to your table - watch and learn other restaurants! The food & wine came really quickly and I noticed on my visit pre-meal to the loos that the ladies and gents are in the same area but each cubicle is allocated male or female AND has its own sink and dryer / towels. Clever idea kids! Located on lively Dean Street right in the heart of Soho and at such great prices, you can't go wrong. Great, friendly atmosphere.",
