Of course, you're not, you're in Soho and you're paying more like 20 quid a head, but the illusion is nice until you get the bill. Having said that, if you factor in that I paid 700 quid to fly to Chengdu to eat this stuff, it's relatively good value. The weird taste sensation (ma) you get from the pepper corns has to be experienced. It's almost like going to the dentists and having your gums injected, in the best possible sense of that experience! I'm a massive fan of potatoes in Chinese cooking too, which is something you seem to get in Sichuanese stew-style dishes. They really soak up the complex array of flavours... and well, I'm salivating just thinking about it. I must get some breakfast...",

I loved the Szechuan hotpot and Numbing and Hot Dried Beef - as they've translated it. But the party I went with all said the side dishes they ordered were good too. Price-wise, you could go as low as 5 pounds for a bowl of noodles, but for a whole meal, you would probably reach about 15 pounds per person for a good meal.",

Being outside the normal Chinatown catchement you wouldn't quite expect to find a good restaurant here, especially as at night this area is a bit seedy (be warned, my female Chinese friend got accosted when she went out to make a phone-call). The food is styled from the Sichuan region and as such many of the dishes are very hot and spicy. The restaurant's signiture dish is a fish in chilli oil dish. Very spicy without much else which was a disapointment.Helpful hint however, the restaurant will let you take the chilli's home with you in a box, perfect to flavor dishes for weeks to come :) Other dishes are above-average to excellent and as such I am always happy to come to this place. There is a lot of space inside, including some private rooms but I've found on Fridays it is very full and you might want to book, (There's no where to sit inside waiting to be seated). Prices are moderate to high, I think the \u00a320 estimate another reviewer mentioned is probably on the low-side but is possible if you stick to Green Tea and don't take the very large dishes such as the fish above. I've been to China for a number of months before and sadly I've yet to find a Restaurant that really matches the food I had in the different provinces. However Bar Shu really does make a good attempt at it and I'd honestly recommend you try it at least once, (remember to order some tap water!) :)",

My interest in the place was encouraged by the involvement as a consultant of the British food writer Fuchsia Dunlop as I had read her delightful book on Sichuan cooking. The first Westerner to train at the famed Sichuan cookery school in Chengdu, this lady knows her onions )and chillis) All the starters on offer are cold, although smaller starter-sized portions of street foods including Dan-Dan noodles and dumplings in chilli oil are to be found at the back of the menu. I recommend the Numbing-tongue Dried Beef with Sichuan Peppercorns to get your taste buds ready for what may follow - if you have been to Sichuan please note the food here is a toned down unless you request it Sichuan hot. Over the last 18 months I have eaten most tings on the menu and recommend you try everything be it the well known Kung Po Chicken or Prawns to tripe or the amazing hot pot. Many dishes are not for the faint hearted. The wine list is very poor and not thought through even though I understand it is difficult to choose wines that compliment this type of cuisine. I would like to see some Pino Grigio from North East Italy as well as some good Alsace.",

Though leaning towards the spicier end of the spectrum, this restaurant manages the capture the subtler, delicate flavours in Sichuan cuisine, without relying on heavy handed use of grease and burnt dried chilli in other lesser Sichuan restaurants.My favourite is the Sea bass poached with chilli on a bed of noodles (the precise name escapes me) and the Mouth Watering Chicken. Dan Dan Mien is a must too.Bar Shu is one of the more authentic Chinese restaurants in London and you may be disappointed at the lack of more familiar dishes (don't ask for a fortune cookie; they're not even Chinese!). Yes there are bones, the skin is kept on the fish and there are few decent vegetarian dishes, but that's why there is a strong Chinese clientele. Be bold and you will be rewarded with an authentic taste of China that is rarely executed so well in this country.4 stars because I have yet to compare it to Hunan in Pimlico and with ones in Manchester, plus I don't want it to be even harder to get a reservation.",

The dishes there taste practically the same as the ones I had at home. I live in NYC where there are many Chinese restaurants and many good ones, and I can tell you that Bar Shu is that much better. I wish they had a branch in NYC. The decoration is also very nice, nicer than any Chinese restaurant I've ever been to in the US. If you want a taste of real Sichuan food, which can be very spicy and isn't for everyone, Bar Shu is the place. It is a little pricey though, but that's true for most good restaurants.",

The Gongbao Chicken is great, and try a Shuizhu fish if you're in the mood for some real spice.

Its dark furniture and intimate tables help make it a fave dating hangout for Chinese embassy staff, as well as clued-up Londoners -- spesh those not averse to their date smelling of garlic for the rest of the evening ;-). The decor is nice, memorable and well-though out, and the restaurant also has at least one room set aside for group bookings, including stags, hens etc... keen to cash in non its \"extreme eating\" label. Other than the usual Szechuanese chili dishes, the braver -- and hungrier -- among you cold ask for the Szechuanese hotpot. This is better if there is a large group at the table, as it is a shared dish. Be warned it may not be to your western tastes, but does give a nice authentic -- and copious -- flavor of China. The bar also stocks some quite strong Chinese liquors for those inclined to experiment there, but be warned you may not remember how you got back home. If indeed you do. On the downside is the price, which is way above the usual Chinatown level, at almost 50 pounds a head. And it is the price that brings back the star rating, as it takes the restaurant just out of the comfortably affordable range, where it should by rights belong.",

We had the whole shrimps as well -- less dry than what I've had before but still quite good. Also the spicy noodles (tantanmien), good and smoky spice.Pretty good selection on their menu (I'd go back for the soup pots and kang pao chicken) and non-Chinese friendly with photos for most dishes! Do look out for their spice ratings (number of peppers) as the hot stuff is no joke.FYI for those familiar with South Beauty in China, Bar Shu's mask logo resembles the logo for the Chinese high end Sichuan chain South Beauty (it is one of the standard business trip meal in Shanghai), but I asked and they're not related.",

    "text": "Despite being a vegetarian, I generally consider myself an adventurous and accepting sort of eater who never shies away from new cuisines or copious amount of chilies. But apparently, traditional Sichuan cuisine and vegetarianism is a little like oil and water. At least, that's how I felt perusing the menu at the acclaimed Sichuanese restaurant, Bar Shu in London's Soho. It was one of those menus where even if you didn't stray beyond the quarantined 'vegetable' section, failing to read fine print, meant you might find minced pork in your fried green beans.From what I could tell, I only had two options, since there were only two veggie dishes demarcated with a chili for \"hot.\" (I need spice). And much to my dismay, when queried, our waitress, who was irritated that I'd even had the gall to ask her a question instead of just placing my order, curtly assured me that Bar Shu's most popular vegetarian dish is the \"pock marked Old Woman's beancurd\" - named for the \"smallpox scarred restaurateur\" who invented the dish.Oy. Call me prejudiced, but ordering a meal that references a highly contagious disease was the opposite of appetizing, and the accompanying photograph of the soft beancurd, pocked and jiggling in a thick red sauce, did absolutely nothing to make it any more so. I knew if I went ahead and ordered \"diseased tofu,\" no matter how tasty it was, I'd spend most of my time imaging this wrinkly old Chinese lady's face and it's unfortunate bout with smallpox - which had so wrongly become the namesake for her dish. My sister struggled through her order for a slightly different reason: the food coming out the kitchen, which we had spied while waiting for our table, looked amazing, however, the pictures of the food on the menu, did not. We're aware that this is fairly typical Asian phenomenon, but still... couple the bad photos with the endless off-putting descriptions (cloud ear fungus, strange sauce, slithery mouth feel), and we were both at a bit of a loss. Help! Someone well-versed in Sichuan! Guide us! Tell us what to do! But our abrupt waitress had little interest in the task, so we ended up with a handful of hit-and-miss dishes (my \"stir-fried vegetables\" was nothing more than a pile of stalky greens - before placing my order, when I asked if they could throw in some tofu for good measure, the waitress delivered her matter-of-fact \"no\" in a way that I understood right away meant \"and that goes for everything else you might have been wondering if we can do too\").On the upside, the food was fresh and of high-quality, and our appetizer of garlicky cucumbers was *unbelievably* delicious; we used the drippings from this dish to jazz up everything that followed.By all accounts, this was a rather authentic Chinese dining experience, which probably would have been better if we'd brought one of our Chinese friends with us... simply to point us to what we *should* order. \u00a0Though, authentic or not, the rushed, impersonal, \"I don't give a damn\" service was really off-putting, and I really would prefer not to be talking about smallpox when I'm dining. \u00a0And I hate to admit, but I missed the customary token fortune cookie.",

    "text": "This place isn't bad, and I have to say it's one of the best chinese restaurants I've been to in Europe. \u00a0I will have to disagree with one of the other reviewers though, and say that given the very large population of Chinese people in California (so yes you can find far better Chinese restaurants in the US than in London---maybe not in New York, but try SF and LA---remember that all the white immigrants went through NY and all the asian immigrants went through SF), the Chinese restaurants in Cali are much more impressive. \u00a0I could name at least 4 Sichuan restaurants off the top of my head that are FAR better than Bar Shu and 1/2 the price in the SF bay area. \u00a0I admit that I am a bit of a foodie, and it can take a lot to impress me, particularly with Chinese food. \u00a0My mother is from Sichuan, and the thing about Sichuan cuisine is that it's not JUST spicy----it's the taste you get with the freshness of your chili sauce, etc. \u00a0The sauces they had at Bar Shu tasted like they came out of a pre-packaged bottle. \u00a0No where near the strong flavours you get in authentic Sichuan chili sauces. \u00a0Particularly, the Mouth-Watering chicken was a HUGE disappointment (way better in California). \u00a0 Things like Ma Po tofu, dan dan noodles, and ants climbing on trees---I could (and do regularly) cook just as well at home (these are EASY family dishes, not restaurant dishes), and I find it painful to dish out 10 pounds for it in a restaurant. \u00a0With that said, if I were a working girl again, I would dish out the money to come back here. \u00a0Chinese food in Europe is often extremely disappointing, and since I will be living here for a while, this is the closest I can get to an authentic Sichuan restaurant. \u00a0But I will definitely be hitting the Sichuan restaurants in the bay area for Christmas holiday when I visit.....edit: in response to one of the other reviewers that said SF has no good Chinese restaurants---you need to leave the city of San Francisco and go out to where the middle class Chinese people live (not all the poor ones stuck in touristy SF Chinatown, which by the way is way less awesome than Oakland Chinatown). \u00a0The city of SF does not have a large Chinese population (the SF BAY AREA does) so you're not going to find much there----it's still probably predominantly white (with the exception of the Mission, which maybe has a good number of Latin americans). \u00a0And stop taking chinese restaurant recommendations from white people/bananas!!! \u00a0No wonder you haven't found anything good!",

We ordered one fish dish one chicken dish and two vegetable dishes which was more than enough food for three people. The eggplant (aubergine) dish was one of the best Chinese dishes I have ever had and I could have licked the plate clean. It is an absolute must order... unfortunately I cannot for the life of me remember what it was called... The ginger scallion fish was also delicious, although a bit pricey. Next time I would go and get all vegetable dishes as these were cheaper and most certainly the highlight of the meal.",

Cross over Shaftesbury and meander into Barshu.Barshu amuses me because the prices are the same as at their sister, Baiwei (and Ba Shan, cattycorner from Barshu and part of the same family) but the setting is cleaner, the staff have some concept of service standards, and the noise level is much more reasonable.We ended up ordering man and wife offal, pickled vegetables, red braised pork, and gong bao prawns. The offal was good, nicely tender, though the spicing was a touch tame. The pickled vegetables were nice, though a touch overpriced.The pork was succulent, served with steamed baby bok choi, and not overly sweet. The prawns were a touch on the sweeter side and the portion was ample, but \u00a319 for gong bao is sort of ridiculous.Two appetisers, two mains, a pot of tea, still water, and one portion of rice came to \u00a366. The value for the money isn't quite there, but the food is solid and closer to authentic than not, and you feel better paying that much here than at Baiwei.Also, unlike Baiwei, this place takes card.

    "text": "A few months ago, my husband and I were shopping in Covent Garden and decided to go out for dinner nearby. Remembering a review of Barshu I had read a while back, we gave it a try. Since then, Barshu has become one of my favorite London restaurants (and one of my favorite Chinese restaurants outside Asia) for several reasons. First, it is very difficult to find authentic Sichuan cuisine outside Asia, and I love those flavors - cumin, tingling hua jiao, vinegar, star anise and of course chilies. Barshu serves up a pretty authentic repertoire - \u00a0I've traveled in Sichuan and these guys do a good job. If you don't usually like \"Chinese food,\" but like fragrant, spicy food - Silk Road flavors - it's worth giving Sichuan a try. Most \"Chinese food\" around here consists of bastardized Cantonese and does no credit to China's varied culinary traditions. Second, they don't treat non-Chinese diners as second-class customers. There is one menu, in English, Chinese and pictures. I did an experiment and spoke (broken, rusty) Chinese my first visit, and English only on my second, and now usually a combination, and I have received the exact same quality food every time. There's no \"secret menu\" rigamarole - the staff seem to want to educate diners about Sichuan cuisine and have made recommendations to maximize the balance and authenticity of the meal - compare this to many places where even when I can read and order off the \"Chinese menu,\" and can point to other tables eating those dishes, staff still hesitate to serve me tripe or bitter melon because I'm not Chinese (no, I would NOT rather have orange chicken and pork fried rice!). Makes sense because Fuscia Dunlop, the first westerner to graduate from Sichuan Institute of Higher Cuisine in Chengdu, is involved. Third, the atmosphere is elegant and appropriate for most occasions. Works for everything from a business dinner to a date to a boozy chile fest with friends. I've liked pretty much every dish I've had here. Both my husband and I are huge fans of the dry wok dishes and the \"water-boiled beef in a ridiculously spicy soup\" (shui zhu - a Sichuan classic). The fragrant shell-on prawns are huge and succulent, if a bit messy. For cold dishes, I can't get enough of the whelk with Sichuan pepper and cloud ear fungus with coriander. For a break from the heat, I love the water spinach (kong xin cai). But really, you can't go wrong, so order what sounds good to you or ask the staff for recommendations.One note: they make their dishes authentically spicy. If you are sensitive to chiles, ask the staff for recommendations for less-spicy dishes. And those of us who DO love heat don't have to go through the rigamarole of assuring the staff they can in fact handle authentic levels of spice!",

    "text": "I miss out the last 2 stars on this review because it's so damn pricy. pay day only!(I went after i got paid) and a minor problem with one dish. \u00a0I'm a BIG fan of spicy chinese food, especially sichuan (I have yet to try hunan which my dad tells me is SUPER-hot, if anyone knows a good hunan place in London, please let me know :)) Bar Shu is definitely one of the better sichuan places I've been to and also, I want to compliment them on the standards not dropping. I've only been twice but visits were spaced apart by a year or so. Anyways, onto the actual review, I booked for 4 at 7pm for Thursdays and was told quite abruptly that we could only stay for one and half hours. No problem, it's london, it's a famous chinese place and they want a quick turnover. Standard for Chinese places in chinatownMy friends and I are pretty assertive people so no sooner as we sat down, our orders were quickly taken, what we ordered: cloud ear fungus with coriander- (definitely a dish for the brave if you're not chinese) which was incredibly moreish as an appetiser, spicy and sour in the right doses and whereas it may look like a small dish for \u00a37.90, THEY PACK ALOT INTO THE PLATE. :DAnts climbing tree: glass noodle dish which came out less spicier than i expected but it was very well flavoured.Sliced Pork with Silk Gourd: Our vegetable dish, instead of seasonal chinese veg, this was a welcome dish because it's not spicy at all, and it definitely cools the mouth down after VERY spicy dishes. It probably tastes better because it's so cooling. Water boiled Pork: WARNING eat with rice, it's numbingly spicy! That's the thing with sichuan, it numbs your tongue with chilli until you cry. If you're crying, it's a sign of a good sichuan dish.Fragrant chicken in pile of chillis: Or what it actually is, Bits of chicken bone/skin/fat in chillies, this was the fatal achilles heel of the meal, the dish was not worth the \u00a318 they charge, the chicken was inedible, it was just bits of bone and chicken skin- tiny tiny bits that we had to treasure hunt in the pile of chillis. AVOID AVOID AVOID. opt for the gongbao chicken instead!Bears Paw beancurd in spicy sauce: Very nice, again quite spicy but i wish they used thicker slices of beancurd and spring onions on top would have totally MADE the dish. \u00a0if you hear something wailing, that would be your wallet crying. Bill inc. service charge came up to \u00a397. Sobsobsob Anyways, I read alot of reviews here complaining about the service but actually service was really good, except that might have been because we were chinese and we ordered in cantonese. (The waiters do both cantonese and mandarin) and the people who served up were really nice and i think under legal advice, they had to warn people about how spicy the dishes are. Our waiter warned us, but it's okay, that bit of malaysian chinese heritage in me can totally take the spice!I'm apprehensive about when i'll be back. it's too expensive to be a regular haunt, but I have regular cravings of sichuan (Biiig problem there!) but I've heard Laodifang does similar dishes for a bargain price so that is my next stop.",

If you keep your expectations at just that, then this place will blow you away. Probably the best Sichuan food I've ever had!You are definitely not going to get a dining \"experience\" at Barshu. The service was pretty standard; not very personable, but speedy and efficient. We also got great recommendations from the server. \u00a0We went on a busy Saturday night. The ambiance was not very energetic, but quite comfortable. The food was definitely the star of the show.Everything down to the Ginseng tea was spectacular. The Gong Bao prawns and Dry-fried green beans were out of this world! We also tried the Beef with chilies, chicken and peanuts, cold pork roll appetiser and the dumplings...nothing disappointed. Looking forward to going back for some of the dry wok dishes that feature some more adventurous meats. The prices are moderate. I would plan on \u00a325+ a head without drinks. Portions are quite generous, but the drinks are a bit overpriced. A good Sichuan meal is expected to be spicy. The spicier the better for me. \u00a0My lips were still burning when I woke up the next morning. Can't wait to go back!",

Dan dan mien - the flavour of the sauce was good but the noodles were overcooked & the bok choy or whatever veggie that came with it was raw. I had to spit it out.2. Boiled crescent dumplings in chili-oil sauce - this dish was not good. The meat just tasted foul. Traditional dumplings are supposed to be made with pork. The meat in these dumplings did not taste or look like pork.3. Red-braised beef with beancurd stick - My brother said the beef reminded him of the way our mom cooked beef stew.4. Bear's paw beancurd in a spicy sauce - this dish was good. It came with sliced chicken even though this item was listed in the vegetable section of the menu.5. Boiled sea bass with sizzling chili oil - the flavor was spot on. My complaints of this dish...usually I've seen restaurants serve this with just filets of fish & not the entire fish with the head (our bowl had 3 halves of heads), bones & skin.Overall the food was good but I felt like it could've been a lot better.",

    "text": "Let me start with a story. Last September I was lucky enough to be able to take an independent holiday in China (meaning we weren't with a tour). Everyone told us we would struggle doing it independently if we didn't speak the language and we laughed in their face when we got to Beijing and everything was in English or at least in pinyin (Chinese words in English letters). Then, we took a trip down to Xi'an...It's not that Xi'an didn't have it's fair share of restaurants with menus with pictures or pinyin (they even had a pizza hut!). It's just that we found ourselves on a budget and ended up in many a restaurant where we were only presented with lists of Chinese dishes and no way of deciphering them.One night we found ourselves in such a restaurant but were lucky enough to be sat opposite a young Chinese couple who saw what we were pointing at, had a good laugh to themselves and immediately intervened. They basically ordered our dinner for us but what came was the strangest, weirdest but tastiest eating experience of our trip.You can imagine then, my excitement at stumbling upon Bar Shu one evening in Soho with my partner, only to find the same strange dishes we had on that fateful night in Xi'an. And let me say, that they were as good as I had remembered. In one mouthful I was transported back to that fragrant, humid main street where I had first tasted a Szechuan pepper so integral to the cooking of this region.I was even lucky enough to get a taste of something we had fallen for whilst in China: the humble Pea Jelly in sauce. Actually when we had it was agar agar we thought, But I recommend it highly, along with the Gong bao chicken and anything with peanuts or cucumberAll in all, I would go back to this restaurant and would highly recommend. Only lost a start because of the price - you could get 4 meals for this price back in Xi'an...",

At the time I didn't always know what I was eating, but it was sure good! \u00a0I could sense everyone was missing their homeland, and these special off-menu meals helped them deal with the homesickness. \u00a0Bar Shu does a great job of providing its diners with adventurous, delicious Chinese food, and I'm glad I've found it!",

You can pretty much find all sorts of meat, poultry, seafood, intestine on the menu. \u00a0 In terms of the dishes, I really like those special Sichuan dishes made with loads of dried red chili peppers, and you have to dig through the peppers to find your food. They are so delicious with the heat from the pepper and numbing tingling sensation from the numbing peppers. They are usually not as spicy as they look, but definitely not for the faint-hearted. I think you should at least have one of those dishes on your table.There are also plenty of non-spicy dishes. I have to say, they are not as good as the spicy ones. We once ordered oxtail with turnip and that was quite disappointing. Overall, it is a great choice for Sichuan food.",

I say that as kind of a bad thing - I'm there for the food and could give two bits about the quality of the chair on which I am sitting. As someone said previously, this place is just 'pretty good' and when you have been going to 'very good' level places in N California or NYC, its a pretty poor showing. The dan dan noodles came with oddly dry and over cooked ground pork. The bok choi was excellent and super fresh so points for that but it was otherwise not real strong and I thought even the spice level was too light although I realize that dish is not particularly spicy. Then I had a sliced pork dish that was supposedly 'hot' but it was 'not'. Also the meat quality was a bit low and I just generally was not impressed with the overall dish. I was coveting a spicy chicken dish being brought to another diner until I read the other review that said it was actually inclusive of bone and very hard to get at.Where is a good Sichuan place in London?!?!?I've now tried just about every place that's been recommended and I feel my three stars are charitable.",

We ordered a few beers, LiLi fragrant beef and of course the chicken with chiles. The waiter \u00a0warned us about the chicken being super spicy, but we were ready! The food came out pretty quickly and was piping hot. The beef was spicy, tasty, tender and tossed with red sweet peppers and edamame. And then the chicken came out...literally small pieces of chicken (with bones) and a gazillion dried red chiles. Wow its was amazing. It's not actually \"hot\" spicy, but more flavorful and the different spices kinda overwhelm your palate. Definitely a must try but recommend ordering some plain rice to smooth out the flavors. Loved it and will go back the next time we are ever in London!",

I really enjoyed the searing heat of the Sichuan peppercorns. The green beans were also quite tasty- stir fried with a bit of pork - but this was on par with other places I have been to and could easily be replicated at home.  I wouldn't say it was over the top amazing considering the cost but it's very solid Chinese cooking for London. A meal for two with wine came to \u00a382. However the wine was excellent and the service was good. Much better than what you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant!",

    "text": "This place has it all! (Except for vegetarian. They don't reallly have that down.) You can have your Szechuan spicy or spicier, your meat identifiable or non-identifiable, your chills regular or numbing. We always go for the Szechuan king prawns, hot and numbing beef, dry fried chicken, and loads of rice to cool it down. They do some interesting things with bean curd as well. I tend to go here once every few months - good for an impressively large and fancy meal.Everything is served family-style, so don't expect your food to come in any particular order. If you sit upstairs, it's less cramped and drafty but the servers are less friendly. Downstairs you'll sometimes get the owner, who can give you menu and cooking tips. Definitely book ahead.",

    "text": "My wife and I usually go to Lido for hot and sour soup when in London but we felt like branching out. Barshu did not disappoint. We got there just before the kitchen closed (10:30pm, not 11:00) and ordered quickly. Despite rushing, we got 3 awesome dishes. The king prawns with cashews and ants climbing a tree will definitely be ordered again. Our third dish, fried chick bits buried in a pile of peppers (some on the bone which the waitress explained), was just as good flavor-wise but was a little too much work to get again next time around. Each item was pleasantly spicy and we asked for a little oil/pepper mix on the side to take it up a notch. Great restaurant. Highly recommended if you're in the area and are in the mood for Szechuan.",

In their defense, I only had 2 dishes -- the spicy chicken and the dan dan noodles. That + a hot tea cost 30 quid (including tip). Fairly stiff pricing.The dan dan noodles isn't really very special. It tastes good, but ...The spicy chicken is different than what I've had before. Usually, it's been pieces of breast or thigh sauteed with the red chillies. This one was much smaller pieces of chicken (including with bone) crispy fried. Really delicious, but a little bit difficult to pick up. Also, hard to pick up the sichuan peppers and experience all the flavors of the dish. You have to work at it. But absolutely the right amount of spice (a lot!).I probably wouldn't go back, simply because of the cost to value ratio. You might try it once.",

With so many tourist traps there, we did some Internet search and stumbled across Bar Shu. It's technically not in Chinatown, but just across Shaftesbury st in Soho. The restaurant itself is quite cleaner and nicer than most Chinese restaurants, and the prices are higher compared to other Chinese restaurants in the area - basically, you pay for quality :-)I had the prawns with cashew, while the other members of my party had the roster pork leg, chicken with cashew, and chicken in chilli. I'm not an expert on Chinese cuisine, so I can't comment on the authenticity, but what I can say is that everything was divine! Especially the pork leg is recommendable, it tastes absolutely phenomenal, amazingly seasoned. One note to remember: if it says 'hot' you better believe them - I've never had food as spicy as this!",

That's all I can really say about Bar Shu in all honesty.This trip, ants climbing a tree were, average, and so was the dan dan mian. The noodles, here, were poor - indistinguishable from the sharwoods packs you buy at Asda.A dish of kung pao prawns was better than average, with delicate spicing (I suspect it would have benefited from more of a mala kick), with plenty of jumbo-sized king prawns. But at nearly \u00a320 for the dish, I'd expect nothing less.It's certainly one of the few places in London that does authentic Sichuanese food. It's massively expensive for what it is, however, and sadly, Red Chilli in Manchester really blows it out of the water both in terms of price and in terms of authenticity. Still, Manchester's a long way from London...",

    "text": "Food was so so but over priced. I grew up in Szechuan so I know about Szechuan food. Service was sub par. The waitress did not speak much English nor did she understand much Mandarin - she speaks only Cantonese. She was impatient & seemed to be in a hurry to get us out of the door before even servicing us food. I would not recommend this place.",

    "text": "I've had the pleasure this week of having two wonderful Chinese meals, one slightly better than the other. I'll start with the better of the two. This week was one where coincidentally, I had plans to eat at two Szechuanese restaurants. BaShan and BarShu. Both are incidentally across the street from each other, and both are authentic. However, I would have to admit that Barshu is finer cuisine and ultimately a better experience. We came as part of a work party of 6 to BarShu on a weekday for lunch. It was quiet and thus service was very attentive. Having had BaShan the night before, I had no qualms having spicy food again (I love it), and had heard so much about BarShu prior to going. Lots was ordered, and everything from MaPo tofu to other starter plate type dishes to non-spicy tofu with pork. For starters, everything came piping hot and definitely is the way Chinese people love being served. No point having cold plates and serving food that gets cold quickly. The other thing you notice here is that everything has a sauce. Mostly spicy, some not. The food can be greasy, but it's with chilli oil, so I'm fine with that. We had quite the spread of everything from Morning Glory vegetables to Spicy Mapo Tofu and I think my favorite of the lot was this pork dish that had both the szechuanese peppers and white cabbage. Compared with BaShan, this place is slightly more refined, and less doused in dried chillis, making the food a little more palatable and accessible to a foreign diner. Additionally, BarShu doesn't seem to use MSG (or at least had a lot less of it than BaShan) so for the mildly allergic like me, this felt definitely less bloating and leaves me feeling a little less breathless in a bad way. 4* and definitely will come back if looking for Szechuanese food.",

    "text": "They're so nice here now! The service has greatly improved and the food is delicious! I came by myself this time and had a mini feast composed of all kinds of little Sichuan appetizers. Bean curd skin with scallion oil (still awesome), boiled dumplings, mushrooms with chili, and my new fave: Yunnan chicken salad with basil and chili.The table next to me ordered a bean thread noodle dish (\"ants climbing a tree\") and it looked enviable. Definitely trying that next time.",
