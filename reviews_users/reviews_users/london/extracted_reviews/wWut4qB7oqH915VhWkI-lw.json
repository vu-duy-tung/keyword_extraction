I was astounded by how long people were prepared to wait in line for food and unsure I'd ever get a look inthankfully I managed to slip in wielding a camera and tried out a veggie burrito. I'm pleased to report it was very nice, but unfortunately I wasn't blown away. Now, I realise the veggie burrito is a different beast to the animal variety, but it's not a bad benchmark for overall food skills. A bit of TLC in the vegetarian department shows an overall sense of care and attention to detail I think, and in this case I'm not sure I understand what all the fuss is about. I'd like to give Freebird another chance as on home turf and with ample ingredients (they were running low on a few things by the time I got to the stall) they may yet convert me. Impressive speed burrito rolling though!",

    "text": "Oh, Mexican food in London, how elusive art thou. Despite several recommendations of 'amazing' places I find myself constantly disappointed (Taqueria, anyone?). I'm starting to lose hope! I got a glimmer of it back with Freebird. Freebird works off of the Chipotle (amazing American burrito chain) school of thought: Take a tortilla the size of a newborn and stick it chock full of rice, beans, tomatoes, salsa, guacamole, cheese, lettuce and if you fancy it, sour cream; wrap it up in tin foil and present it like a compact log. I love Chipotle, so they were off to a good start. Taking a bite, the tortilla was nice and fresh. I'm not sure if they make them in-house, but I wouldn't be surprised. It was very good. The other ingredients were tasty as well. Even the salsa had a good kick to it. I'm also glad they had a black bean option. Finding black beans in London has proved trying to me in the past. I usually have to go to Whole Foods for them. Sooooo much better than pinto beans. All in all, a tasty little concoction. It's not the best I've ever had, but it would certainly do for a drunken 4th meal if I'm ever in Soho on a Saturday and feeling vulnerable. (That said, I hope they keep late hours. I can't find them online. They would make a killing around 2 am on Wardour) Or at least until Chipotle finally comes to London.",

They are the closest I have had to a San Fran one which I sorely miss. I usually go for ether steak or carnitas, but on my visit I had a bit of steak. To say it was good was an understatement. I was whisked back to Californian nirvana with each mouthful and shall have to get some business cards printed if it means I might get one of these beauties for free. But to be fair they are reasonably priced and in times like these its nice to get a relatively healthy, gut busting lunch for a fiver.",

Poor fellas: the three of them in their short assembly line at their mobile stall were absolutely beleaguered by about four hundred ravenous Qypers. Admittedly, I'd made use of the free bar by this point so my taste buds might not have been working at maximum efficiency. Nevertheless, I got a massive burrito stuffed with everything: choice of black or refriend beans, rice, salsa, steak (or chicken or veg). It was seriously big, and seriously filling. The search for good Mexican is a constant challenge in London, but youn could do a lot worse than Freebird for a takeaway burrito.",

After years of looking for the best burrito in town Big Dave still swears by Daddy Donkey on Leather Lane (a 5 star joint if I've ever seen one). The only reason it gets a four star review is because Big Dave wants to taste every filling with every bite. Freebird doesnt deliver this. You tend to get most of the cheese in one bite, most of the sour cream in another. The big man tends to leave it for about 5 mins when he gets back to his desk, so everything has the chance to blend before eating. Still, top quality burritos far better than any shop or street stand (other than Daddy D). I will be back tomorrow for more of the same goodness.",

And let's be honest, that's a lot of love.On the recommendation of Eamon B, I paid Freebird a visit one sunny London day. I'd been riding for a couple of hours and to say I was starving was an understatement. Luckily, the sheer size of the burrito I was made took the edge of the gnawing in my belly. Once I started eating it I was in burrito heaven.While standing in the sun chowing down on this beast, a cyclist from Belgium struck up a conversation with me about riding in London. After a couple minutes I noticed him eyeing the succulent meat I was in the process of devouring. I was torn...do I play a good British host and share? or do I run away screaming \"it's mine...my precious!!!!\". Sadly I must admit I opted for the latter one after making hurried excuses and whispering the aforementioned line to myself...I don't want Belgian's thinking I'm crazy. They have great beer.Anyways, more to the point Freebird is one of the best burritos I've ever had and definitely the best in London I've tried to date. It's set me up for a good comparison when I tackle the burrito scene in SF next month. And now I'm hungry.",

    "text": "Ten years ago, I nearly moved to London to open a chain of burrito stands. Nice to know that my business idea was a good one. Even an OK burrito is pretty damned good. Particularly on a Thursday after a two-night-bus Wednesday eveningThis is a 4* burrito for London, though just a 3* for San Fran.Street market style with excellent carnitas, and grilled tortillas. Two types of salsa: One pico and one tomatillo-medium. Totally decent (Hass Avocado-based) guacamole. \u00a35 for a burrito, \u00a35.50 with guac.And everything's OK, but really just OK. Like many of the new burrito start-ups. Beans and rice were a little flat and flavourless, the carnitas were absolutely stuffed with flavour, however. It might be nice if the staff spent a little time learning to roll, though. The burrito should resemble a tube more than a blob wrapped in tinfoil.",

    "text": "I've been an occasional at Freebird for a while now, but I'd love to be a regular. It's a small stand tucked just off Brewer Street on Rupert Street.Freebird are about as good as it gets for London burritos (I've had SF Mission based burritos and these are not too far behind in terms of tastiness!). For a fair price \u00a35-6, you get a hefty burrito made freshly in front of you, piled high with generous portions of either beef, pork or chicken (or veggie for those who are so inclined). Guac is optional and well worth adding!They are speedy (and that's a good thing considering how popular they are), friendly and a great lunch option. Anyone who considers themselves a fan of Mexican food needs to try this place.",

    "text": "This is it. The one. The burrito in London that wouldn't go out of business in San Francisco. I had a 'just-OK' burrito here early on, and didn't go back for a while. Well, I don't know what's happened lately, but every burrito I've gotten here recently has kicked ass. Maybe it's because I'm going earlier and beating the rush. Maybe it's because the ingredients are very good quality. Maybe it's because they don't skimp on the good stuff (meat, guacamole, pico de gallo, fajita veggies, etc). They roll fatties.In fact, I've had a few Freebird burritos fall apart on me. That's OK. If my burrito must fail, let it fail due to its ambition. I've often lamented the politeness of competing burritos, so let it be known that Freebird suffers from no such good manners. PS- This review is actually for the stand on Goodge Street, not the Soho one, in case that matters.",

    "text": "Lions, and tigers, and bears, OH MY! \u00a0I can't believe the burrito that I had today. \u00a0I thought Tortilla was going to be the best I had in London, even though it was Chipotle style mexican, but I was wrong. \u00a0Freebird is the best.It's not an actual restaurant just a stand and I almost went \u00a0past it. \u00a0It is right on the corner of Rupert and Brewer. \u00a0Yellow sign. \u00a0In front of Snog. \u00a0I'm not sure if they are there everyday or the hours, but it seems like lunch time. \u00a0I was there today around 2pm.It's obviously not the best Mexican I've ever had, but it is on the comparison level of San Diego. \u00a0The only place I've been to here that I can say that to. \u00a0Great flavors. \u00a0The black beans. \u00a0The chicken. \u00a0Very great tortilla as well. \u00a0Hot sauce is good, but I wish the hot was a little hotter. \u00a0I'll probably go back once a week, except I'm going back the next two days to try the carne asada and carnitas.No place to sit immediately around since it's a stand, but I really don't care that much. \u00a0I'm honestly excited to tell people back home that I found a Mexican place. \u00a0So stoked.",

    "text": "I first learned about this place when my boss ducked out to grab some lunch and returned with a Freebird burrito. After 2 bites he declared to everyone in the office that this was the best burrito he ever had, much better than his (former) regular burrito place. Needless to say, I went there a few days later to see what my boss was so impressed about. I went there around 11.30 so it was quiet and the guy making the burritos let me try both the chicken and the beef as I could not decide which one I wanted. I settled for the beef and was treated to a very, very good burrito with fresh ingredients and well-seasoned meat. I was equally impressed with the chicken burrito that I had on my next visit; the meat was very tender. Alltogether, a very good deal for a fiver.",
