    "text": "An institution in the Borough Market area and the pub with the most charm out of the collection surrounding the area. However, that charm does mean it pays the price of being very very busy at times. It's pretty much your quintessential boozer insider - all wood, brass, barrels for tables and real ale. There's a decent amount of room inside, but it's not huge by any stretch of the imagination. It has a lot of real ale on offer so for any CAMRA fans, this is a decent pub to head for a visit. It gets very popular in the evenings, and you can often find yourself forced out onto the street outside - not the worst thing as the pub's atmosphere flows out onto the street and its a generally very friendly crowd. However, the delights of the British weather can make it a bit of a lottery especially on a Friday night. It's been said already - but despite it being very busy the service is pretty decent and they get through serving people quickly, generally are good at getting the order right and are friendly. Food here is your typical pub grub - but of a pretty good quality. Oh and as dmj1962 says - if you fancy a beer at 6am, this place is open for businessalways a bit alarming when I work past it on the way to an early start to work and there's a load of people tucking into their pints(!)",

Excellent both in the Summer and Winter for different reasons. In the Summer it's nice to have a pint in the road outside the pub, watching the busy goings on of the market. In the Winter it's a great place to escape the cold and grab a warming pint of ale. Be warned it's not the best equipped pub, spatially, for the number of punters who frequent it in the evenings. It is however a very traditional and good all round boozer for a proper London pint.",

Stand outside in the summertime to catch the busy throng of the market. Great place to meet up if you're doing the tourist thingy or an after work quicky. The staff are fast on their feet and don't dawdle! The place is awash with both local residents and office workers. The atmosphere is friendly and engaging.

The toilets are sometimes are little on the grubby side but perhaps that adds to the whole London charm?This is definitely more of a summer pub and if you do stand outside which is probable, make sure you try and stay on the pavement as they are now becoming strict about customers standing in the road and causing havoc with the passing traffic.",

All this means the atmosphere is a little less scrum-like: all the better to enjoy the impressive range of beer! --------------- Located right in the heart of Borough market, this is a real-ale pub par excellence, serving one of the largest (if not the largest) range of ales in London, together with the odd real cider. And by large, I mean large - they have 12 hand-pumps, with a regularly changing choice through the day (they have over 20 beers ready at any one time - see web-site for details). They often feature West-Country ales hard to find elsewhere in London. The pub itself is large, with several rooms, all with wood-panelled decor. Despite this, it can get absolutely jam-packed, especially in the evenings and when the market is in full swing opposite. Service, however, usually manages to cope and is generally friendly. One advantage of being next to the market is its early week-day opening time - if you fancy a pint at 6am! There's a restaurant upstairs, although I've not eaten here. You could always have a bite of something in the market, of course - indeed, it would seem the perfect venue to round off a trip to the market itself - or a visit to Southwark Cathedral Finally, film buffs may recognise the pub from some of the many films shot in the area, because of its slightly grimy, Dickensian feel. The pub even became a book-shop in a Harry Potter film!",

Don't fall in love with your pint, because some handles will see two or three badge changes per night when busy.The MP is easily the best pub in the Borough Market area and should not be missed.",

I think it's quite a long standing establishment but how longI must confess I know not. The pubs proximity to Borough Market and to the business district nearby mean that its stays busy throughout the week. I've been here twice and it's been packed both times which can make getting served and finding a place to stand a tricky business. It's worth giving it a try though because they have an excellent oft changing selection of ales on tap (check out all the different beermats on the walls too!). I think I need to figure out when this place is at it's quietest because I'd like to come here from time to time.",

    "text": "Just a brilliant, brilliant place to go for a drink. It does get extremely busy, both inside and out so not really some where to go for a swift, cheeky Sussex half but if you've got the time (and patience) to wait to get served (not criticism of the service, just reflects how popular it is) then it is well worth it. The range of beers available is truly impressive, constantly changing, and even the most fervent ale geek will find his (or her) beard bristle with the anticipation of supping a previously unknown brew. And if you're unsure of what to go for the Harvey's Sussex Best is consistently top drawer. As mentioned above, it does get absolutely rammed so a degree of tolerance is required, especially on a Saturday, but it really is worth it, honestly. There is a dining room upstairs, staffed by the most charming waitress I have had the pleasure to have met. The food is pretty damn good. A proper pub menu, generous, well presented and with a couple of surprises thrown in for good measure. (I started with a delicious duck, fig and pistachio terrine on Saturday. Wow. Truly wow.) I highly recommend the burger or fish and chips. Classics done extremely well. I've never had one of their mixed grills, much to my shame, but I am extremely keen to give it a shot! Everything about the Porter says proper, old school boozer and in my humble opinion, it really can't be beat. One of my greatest pleasures is to wander through the market, maybe picking up something to eat on the way through, a pint of Harvey's Sussex best from the Porter and an hour or so spent outside, chatting in the sun, soaking in the sights, smells, and sounds of the market. London simply doesn't get any better than this.",
