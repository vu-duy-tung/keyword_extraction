I was ecstatic when I heard that Petrus earned two Michelin stars -- it definitely deserved it!Yes, it is very expensive, but your tastebuds will thank you. Everything was meticulously prepared and, as much food as we got on the tasting menu, we were never uncomfortably full. I even had room for a few items from the carte de bonbons -- the manager was kind enough to provide me with a small \"take away\" box with some extra chocolates as well!The wine list is also something else to behold -- especially when you get to the listings of Petrus and realize how rich some people must be!",

Service caused them to miss the fifth star as well as a fried item (I don't know what it was) that was served with the scallops. We arrived at 9:30 pm with reservations and wasn't able to order until 10:00pm. Once we ordered, the courses came quickly and they also threw in a few extras. We felt like they were reinventing the wheel while all we wanted were some quality food. Of course, the extra dessert was awesome as well as the red mullet dish, pork and duck! Chocolate sphere dessert is a must!",

    "text": "Petrus is a place that you shall never forget. Like some who go on a pilgrimage to Mecca, Petrus is a pilgrimage for the true gastronome. I had the luxury of sitting at the Chef's table, so we got to watch everything being cooked and prepared in the kitchen and it was like watching poetry in motion. The kitchen was almost silent, all you could hear was the sizzling of food and the odd clang of a pan. It was incredible to see how each dish was lovingly prepared. The skill and concentration from each chef was enthralling. We had the pleasure of Marcus Wareing cooking for us, and we were spoiled. The amuse bouche of a parmesan encrusted deep fried risotto ball was heaven. These were goldenballs with a particularly tangy bite. My Mother was a particular fan. We then had a foie gras starter which isn't usually my thing for taste reasons and a little for ethical reasons, but it was rather nice. The wine we had with that was perfect. Next came a shot glass filled with vichyssoise and an oyster. I managed to embarrass myself by almost choking on the oyster, but I was very thankful that I wasn't in the main dining room as I feel that would have been even more humiliating than just being laughed at by everyone at my table. Following on from that we had some skate, which was the best skate I have ever eaten, it had been deboned and was cooked to perfection I didn't know existed. The reduction was just right, off setting the sweetness of the fish and that was matched with a rather lovely Loire valley white wine. By this stage I was feeling a little fuzzy, the wine matching was spot on and I was also aware that I was drinking some of the finest wines in the world. The food didn't stop coming, We then had some scallop and black pudding which made me want to change my sexuality and have Marcus Wareing's babies. Next course was some pork which was served with a Chilean red. This pork literally melted in the mouth and was so beautifully seasoned and was a real treat for the taste buds. They still haven't recovered from the near orgasmic tickling they were given that night by a man called Marcus. We then had some cheese, which was like having the whole range of cheeses from La Fromagerie on a slab of slate! I had some beautiful cows milk cheeses that were quite stinky and runny, I also had a few goat and sheep milk too. The chutneys and crackers that accompanied the cheeses were spot on too, they had just the right amount of tang to leave the palate clean after each cheese. We then had some chocolates as a pre-dessert which were stunning. Then out came the desserts which were absolutely amazing. There were a selection for out table (8 of us) and they were presented on a slab. There was everything from creme brulee, chocolate tart, fig tart type thing but I was a massive fan of the panna cotta. Marcus again had seduced me. He really knows how to turn a girl. With our coffee came a seection of petit fours and they were very nice too. We had everything from little madeleines, to macaroons but my favourites were the little pastries with custard in. By that stage I did feel like Moby Dick but all of this nice food did turn my stomach into a bottomless pit. We then ended our meal with a 1936 Armagnac! It was quite exquisite and I am convinced it was the thing that made me really tipsy. Not the wines or champagne aperitif beforehand. Well that is my story that I am sticking to anyhow! It is one of those places that is really worth going to, the food and service are out of this world. If you really love your food and want to visit one of the finest restaurants in the world, you really should go. I guarantee you no disappointment to be had with a meal in Petrus.",

The food is out of this world - we had a 5/7 course meal and believe me we were very full. We have been to quite a few good restaurants and this has been my favourite so far. The service was the best we have ever had - thanks for the overall experiance to Jean-Philippe Susilovic and the team and of course the Chef Sean Burbidge. Also a big thank you for showing us around the kitchen it was a nice end to an incredible day. Well worth a booking - food and service is 10/10 PS - if you want to really impress your guest\\s buy them a nice bottle of Petrus Magnum for a jaw dropping sum of \u00a349500...LOL",

    "text": "It would have been a great experience food wise, but the service is what absolutely killed it. My partner and I went there to start our first day off in London right. We were exhausted from a 10-hour flight and just looking forward to our meal. When we arrive, it was a bit awkward to start with, there is no music, the staff looked at us as if we were strangely as if we were lost, and there were only 4 other people in the restaurant. So we are seated in the middle of the restaurant, even though we requested to be sat by a window, however we didn't mention it. Our server came over to greet us, and things started off smoothly. We had never seen such great service in our life...in the beginning that is. We got our \"Palate Cleanser\" which I thought was terrible and inedible, but my partner seemed to enjoy it. I was confused on what to do with it because I couldn't imagine eating it by itself, so I politely asked my server if it was a spread or if it should be eaten together with something else. She glared at me as if I was the most unintelligent human being on Earth. She asked, \"what do you mean?\" \"you just eat it\" then walked behind a large vase of flowers by the restroom and talked to the hostess about my questions. We could hear every word as she tried to whisper it. \"He just asked me what he should do with it....\" \"You should have told him to eat it and motion with your hands a spoon to his mouth hahahaha\". So now that I was fully embarrassed on top of being exhausted, I was just looking forward to finishing and heading back to my hotel. As other courses were brought out to us the servers and hostess continued to just stare at the both us making us feel very uncomfortable. We have dined at countless classy or upscale places and none have ever made us feel remotely unwanted or unwelcomed. To top things off, we went from about 2-3 people coming by to check on us and bring out food to absolutely nobody. Halfway throughout our lunch, every server disappeared, except for an exceptionally hard working French man who was now stuck with about 4 tables by himself. At least he was pleasant. It was the most bizarre thing I've ever witnessed at a restaurant. Everybody in the restaurant seemed to vanish out of thin air all at once. So now, our new waiter offered us some cheeses and then went on his way. We then waited... and waited... and waited some more for our dessert. Finally after becoming super annoyed, we asked the hostess that finally reappeared, if we could place our third courser. When it was all and over with we had been there about 2 1/2 hours just for lunch! That was ridiculous and unacceptable. If I could have knew how bad this experience was going to be ahead of time, We certainly would have ordered our food to go and tried to eat it elsewhere. I would NOT recommend this restaurant to anybody. It's a bit sad based on our expectations of a Gordon Ramsey restaurant. The food, other than the \"pallet cleanser\", was amazing but the experience ruined it.",

    "text": "As a fan of Gordon Ramsay (I've watched Hell's Kitchen, Kitchen Nightmares AND own his autobiographies) I'd been thinking about going to this place for ages, but somehow it'd slipped my mind during my recent trip to London... till the last day when, fresh from Paris (and its disappointing meals), we'd decided to make a reservation on a whim. How lucky to be able to get a reservation for the day itself just 2 hours till lunch service! (Overheard a conversation between our server and another guest that this is rare- usually it's fully booked and it's impossible to get in without a reservation, so make sure you book in advance!)Located reasonably near the Knightsbridge tube station, yet far enough to be situated in a quiet neighbourhood- I almost forgot that busy Knightsbridge was just minutes away.Service was excellent from the get-go, they went out of their way to check in our coats AND tons of shopping bags (we'd spent the morning at Oxford Circus) and we were quickly seated in a bright, airy area (actually the entire restaurant seems bright and airy). Our servers were polite and chatted with us easily, making what could be a somewhat formal and intimidating meal much more relaxed.We decided on the 3-course lunch menu for 30 pounds and I thought that it was worth every bit of that.Amuse-bouche was watercress puree with smoked salmon that came in a very generous serving. The puree was light and refreshing and smooth, really helping to tickle the palate, and complemented the smoked salmon well.We had the beef tartare and duck confit as entrees. It was delicious and servings were also very generous. Everything was well-seasoned and cooked.But the star of the show was definitely the mains. I had the steak, and my dining partner the cod and they both came cooked just well- especially the cod which was really fresh, cooked evenly and well with no areas of under/overcooked-ness and basically just perfection in a plate.Desserts were impressive as well. Our \"pre-dessert\" was passionfruit mousse with a secret twist- you'll have to go there to find out what! It was rather Heston Blumenthal in that aspect, and we were really amused (nothing too out-of-this-world, for all the conservative ones who may be worried). We had the baked alaska and also a apple parfait which were also excellent- nothing particularly new or different but just 2 desserts very well done. Post-dessert, we also had these complimentary delicious white chocolate balls that came in a dry-ice filled metal container.In addition, we had handmade cherry macaroons as we had a special occasion to celebrate. Although it wasn't as brilliant as the other macaroons we'd tried recently (those being Pierre Herme and Lauduree- masters of the macaroon industry), it certainly held it's own and was a very nice touch to the meal.Most amazing meal I've ever had. Would definitely visit again when I'm back in London... and won't someone give this place their well-deserved 3 Michelin stars already???",

    "text": "We dined at Petrus in January 2013, with snow falling softly all around. It was a very special weekend for us, and Petrus really made it shine.The restaurant itself has a very relaxed and comfortable feel to it. Whilst we like our fancy restaurants, sometimes the Michelin-star places can be overly formal, which I think takes from the atmosphere. Not Petrus; though the staff are obviously of the highest caliber, they relax rather than intimidate - friendly without going over the top.Petrus caters well for us vegetarians, another huge plus for me, Usually, Michelin star French means I'll be having the salad, but Petrus serve a full vegetarian menu - perfect!For starters I had the tomato broth, which will forever be 'the best soup I ever had' Beautiful vegetable pieces presented on their own first, then joined by the tomato, which tasted like the juice of about 30 tomatoes condensed and condensed and condensed into the most flavoursome starter I have ever enjoyed - wonderful.For mains I had a mushroom pithivier which simply collapsed with a puff when touched it with my fork; a beautiful dish with pastry, mushrooms, slightly creamy but not too much, served with vegetables. Peter had lobster, and we didn't leave one scrap on the plates; fab-u-lous.Before the deserts came we had an in-between treat of small spheres of white chocolate, each on a perspex stick and presented in a 'dry-ice' silver container.We watched our fellow diners have the signature desert 'chocolate sphere' but we decided on some other choices instead. I had the hazelnut parfait, and again - sweet, delicious, inventive and so flavoursome.Next was an in-between treat of sugar pastry fashioned into tiny ice-cream cones, with a soft white fondant cream, full of popping candy!We had to try the cheeses, and again the staff were more than helpful; we really had fun going over the selection.Even the presentation of chocolates at the end of the meal was special.We had several other amuse-bouche throughout the meal. We're not drinkers as such, but we did have G&Ts made with Berkeley Square gin (like drinking flowers; yum!) and my favourite white, a really good Gew\u00fcrztraminer.Obviously this kind of meal doesn't come cheap, but save your pennies and have a real treat for yourself if you are ever in this part of the would. If I could rate Petrus 6-out-of-5 I world; I loved it.",

We tried a little bit of everything and there was not a single dish that was disappointing. Even the cheapest of the wine selections suggested by the sommelier paired perfectly with our courses. At any given time we would have 4 staff members delivering food and topping off drinks. But this was by no means overwhelming. They did it in such a way that you barely noticed they were even there. The size and ambiance of the restaurant was perfect. Definitely a pricey meal ($200 / person), but the value of quality for the price makes this one of the best dining experiences in a long time.",

    "text": "For starters, when you walk in you are not only greeted by the friendly staff but also by a large circular glass wine tower, outfitted with hundreds of wines, nearly all outside my budget. The restaurant is small, though not cramped, and has room for sixteen tables. With ten cooks in the kitchen and at least ten more \u00a0staff in the dining room, it's more than one staff member per table.With all the supposed high-rollers around us, we were the only table with a bottle of tap water on the table -- London's finest. There are two menu choices at dinner -- a 3 course dinner or a 5 course chef's tasting menu. They also offer a full vegetarian menu that can be used for the 3 course dinner. Each dish sounded amazing, so the choices were tough. Before we even ordered, we were brought a canape to start which included a mini fois gras sandwich and a fish croquette. Hard to dislike fois gras or anything fried and each were quite a nice start. Next we were served a watercress mousse with salmon tartar, horseradish sauce and thinly sliced potatoes (the Vegetarian's mousse substituted pickled vegetables for the salmon). Whoever thought to make a mousse out of watercress was probably laughed at, but when you make it this good, it's no laughing matter.For our first course, I selected the pan-fried scallops with cauliflower, anchovy and caper beurre noisette. Often times a scallop dish will come with 2 or 3 scallops, but this dish had a whopping 5. Each were perfectly crispy, yet delicate on the inside. Between each scallop was a potato (I think) pancake of sorts. The dish contrasted the delicious scallops with the crispy cakes and was brought together with the tiny fresh anchovy and beurre noisette sauce. The Vegetarian ordered the English asparagus salad with quail eggs and hollandaise sauce -- and topped with truffles, of course. As any true Michelin starred restaurant, each dish was sauced table side. The meal was off to a killer start.The second course was a no-brainer for me -- pork belly. The dish was a crispy Suffolk pork belly with sage Lyonnaise, braised apple and Madeira jus. The pork comes out as a pressed square with the crispiest crispy skin you'll ever see. I've actually seen Ramsey make this on TV, and it involves cooking the pork twice and pressing it for hours before crisping the skin. I could eat this dish almost every day. The Vegetarian had wild mushroom linguine with spring onions, shaved parmesan and cep sauce -- with the obligatory truffles. The pasta was so rich but not heavy, a magical balance.Prior to our dessert courses (more on that soon), we were pressured (not really) into a cheese course. For the first time I tried a goat cheddar, something I didn't know existed....Now dessert. First we received our regular dessert, a White chocolate cylinder filled with coffee and mascarpone ice cream for the Vegetarian and a Pistachio parfait with sour cherry carpaccio and elderflower cream for me. The coffee \"mousse\" cylinder was just over the top. My parfait was hardly traditional, but it was all gone after I was done with it, so it was great. After this regularly scheduled dessert we were brought a cone of passion fruit cream which was topped with what can only be described as \"pop-rocks.\" Yes, you heard me. Though I'm certain they were house made and that we were the only ones in the dining room that had ever had them let along heard of them.Soon after this course, the manager kindly asked if we were interested in taking a tour of the kitchen and sitting in the lounge area to relax. I think it was mostly to turn our table over, but the way it was done was perfect. We toured the kitchen, watched them in action and then were treated like royalty in the lounge. We were given a little chest of chocolate, chocolate almonds, frozen ice cream on a stick and coffee. We sat, digested and relaxed. It was pretty splendid. After a nice relaxing espresso and more chocolate than I could eat, it was time to bid Petrus adieu. Upon leaving, the Vegetarian was presented a small box with a chocolate treat for later.Overall, I was pretty blown away by the service, the food and the decor. A trifecta of awesomeness. Considering the level of service and quality of food, the prices were reasonable, though with the conversion rate to pounds, it's a bit more expensive. Definitely not a cheap meal by any means, but as a celebration for our one-year anniversary, it was well worth it. If ever in London, it is well worth a visit, especially for the lunch 3 course menu du jour which is half the dinner price.",

    "text": "Again, comparing this vs. other fine dining establishments and not against your typical restaurant, I'm not extremely impressed, but had a good exxperience mostly due to a gentleman by the name of Pasquale, who was quite great to deal with. \u00a0I have to begin by saying I absolutely adored the decor. \u00a0If I were to design my own restaurant, I think I'd design it exactly the way Petrus looks. \u00a0I actually like the lack of a bar, similar to Tru. \u00a0The wine room in the center of the restaurant is really great. \u00a0I couldn't get a reservation for 7pm, despite the fact that when we arrived (at 6:45) there was only one table occupied. \u00a0We had to request a wine list, which we looked at for about five minutes without anyone coming to advise us and then finally after this time they asked if we would like to see the Sommelier (you would expect as soon as the wine list was requested they would send over the Sommelier). \u00a0Nonetheless, we got a great bottle of wine from Provence. \u00a0They then brought out the precursur to the meal, which was a pumpkin puree with mushroom foam and some foie gras bites, which were good. \u00a0It took a bit longer to take our order, which I found strange considering the staff to table ratio was about 1:1 with people sort of just walking around looking busy. \u00a0I was a bit confused when different people were coming over to try to take our order as again I'm comparing with say, Tru, where there are about three staff members watching your table at all times, but you still always know who your main 'order taker' would be. \u00a0Continuing on with the service, the only complaint I had is it took about half an hour for our desserts to come out after we ordered. \u00a0They did bring out a 'pre' dessert as they said there were some problems in the \u00a0kitchen but that was still rather annoying. \u00a0I did like how they asked if we needed a taxi upon receipt of our dessert, which we did so that it was ready \u00a0just as we finished. \u00a0The food, I have to say, was amazing. \u00a0I'd put it on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best thing you've ever eaten (Tru) at a 9. \u00a0It was very flavorful and extremely well prepared. \u00a0The plating was also wonderful. \u00a0To start I had the frog legs and my husband had the quail. \u00a0Both were just amazing. \u00a0Again, plating was perfect and taste was great. \u00a0For mains I had the pigeon and my husband had the pork belly. \u00a0I have to say if you're going, get the pigeon. \u00a0It's clearly their specialty given the elaborate presentation. \u00a0They butcher the perfectly succulent bird table side in a sort of show causing the neighboring tables to look at yours wondering what you've done to get this treatment. \u00a0They prepare the meat in a pile and give you the legs separately. \u00a0The meat was so tender. \u00a0They bring out sides not on the menu (scalloped potatoes and roasted veggies for us) that were also great. \u00a0For dessert you have to get the white chocolate cup with chocolate mousse. \u00a0It was so great. \u00a0The plating was creative, given the vessel (cup) can also be eaten and tasted great too! \u00a0Would definitely recommend if you're looking to spend a lot; be preapred to leave spending USD400.00.",

    "text": "As par of our honeymoon, my wife and I passed through London. \u00a0London is a great city and one we hope to spend more time at in the future, but the most we could manage was a 20-hour layover this time around. \u00a0Given the short amount of time we were here, we decided to squeeze in a few sights, shopping at Harrods, and of course, a meal. \u00a0The wife is a Gordon Ramsay fan, so I decided to have us visit one of his many restaurants. \u00a0Because I knew shopping at Harrods was going to be a priority, I chose Petrus. \u00a0Petrus is a short 10 minute walk from Harrods on Kinnerton Street. \u00a0It is a 1 Michelin Star restaurant serving French food with British flair and British ingredients. The atmosphere here is a balance of modern and classic, with the focal point being the enormous, circular glass wine cellar in the center of the dining room. \u00a0Around it are the tables with a variety of regular tables & chairs in addition to tables with booths. \u00a0The service here is, of course, top notch. \u00a0It's very attentive, but not overbearing at all. \u00a0You have a good amount of privacy, but your drink will never sit empty and empty plates will never sit in front of you. \u00a0But of course, you're probably wondering how the food is? \u00a0It's great! The menus here change seasonally and are presented a la carte (3 courses, 65GBP) or Chef's Tasting Menu (75GBP). \u00a0On our visit, my wife chose to go the a la carte route and I chose the tasting menu. To start, we were both serve an amuse bouche consisting of a foie gras + jelly sandwich and a cigar filled with truffled cream cheese. \u00a0This was followed by a carrot soup. \u00a0All were very tasty small bites. \u00a0Wish I could have had more! \u00a0The first menu item up was my wife's appetizer. \u00a0She chose the a la carte menu just to order this special. \u00a0It's a pasta with wild mushrooms, parmesan foam, and A LOT of fresh Alba truffles freshly shaven table side. \u00a0At the same time, I was served my first course: \u00a0ballotine of Landes foie gras with semi dried grapes, green beans and hazelnut crumble. \u00a0Again, both dishes were simply AMAZING! \u00a0The foie gras was very well balanced and the wife's pasta was just pure decadence. \u00a0Next up was my second course: \u00a0pan-fried sea scallops with cauliflower, anchovy and caper, lemon beurre noisette. \u00a0The scallop was perfectly cooked, as expected, with a great crust and tender center. \u00a0This was followed by our main courses. \u00a0My wife ordered the roasted venison with braised red cabbage, smoked chestnut puree and juniper berry jus. \u00a0For my main course, there was a choice in the tasting menu, so I chose the Red leg Partridge with pearl barley, pancetta, roast fig, walnut and jus. \u00a0Both were good and different for both of us, as these kinds of dishes aren't available back home in Hawaii. \u00a0Next up was my palate cleanser/pre-dessert. \u00a0There was a choose of this standard dish or cheese plate (additional charge). \u00a0The standard option on this occasion was a Blackcurrant sorbet with lemon meringue and champagne foam.Next up was dessert. \u00a0For her's, my wife chose the caramelized figs with hazelnut sable, fresh honeycomb, cob nuts and yogurt sorbet. \u00a0My dessert, on the other hand, was the standard menu item, and the dessert they're known for hear. \u00a0It's a chocolate sphere with milk ice cream and honeycomb. \u00a0It's served to you as a sphere as the name implies, however, they pour warm chocolate sauce over it, melting it and revealing the ice cream. \u00a0Both were great, though the wife wished she had ordered something sweeter. \u00a0Finally, we were served petite fours of white chocolate coated ice cream. \u00a0After we paid, the staff gave us a tour while we waited for our cab. \u00a0We even got to meet Petrus' head chef. \u00a0After that, it was back to the Renaissance London Heathrow to get some sleep before heading over to the airport for our noon flight the next day.",

The highlights was the Fillet of Cornish Turbot, the Seared Orkney Scallops and the Braised Short Rib. The service was impeccable and I highly recommend you order a mixed drink as the bar was on point across the board. The only objection I have against this place is simply the cost. As long as you know it will be a very pricey dinner upfront - but I certainly felt it was worth the price.",

If you have lived in London this walk is a breeze. As for the food, it was definitely worth it. I thought that my foie gras and pear balanced each other to produce an enjoyable starter. My husband on the other hand was super satisfied with all his scrumptious choices. We felt like we got extra love from the kitchen as they served complimentary surprises surprises in between our courses. Furthermore, the presentaion of the food absolutely pleased both our eyes and taste buds. The serving portion here notable adequate. We were really full to the rim when we exited.Contrary to some reviews, the service we received was excellent, friendly and attentive. Our glasses were never empty the whole 3 hours we were here. We stayed this long because we really enjoyed our experience here. In conclusion, it was well worth the \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3.",

    "text": "Petrus is one of the London's top fine dining destinations. Excellent service paired with equally fantastic French food. They have a great tasting menu - 5 courses for 75 quid. While expensive, for a Michelin starred restaurant, Petrus was surprisingly reasonable.My friends were an hour (yes an hour late) for our reservation, but the good staff at Petrus kept me nicely hydrated and offered me a few snacks to nibble on including freshly made salt vinger popcorn and mini cod fritters. As for the Chef's menu, we started with a pre-appetizer of a braised pork. This was quickly followed by a delightful dish of pressed foie gras and confit of duck served with some pineapple garnish. The sweetness of the pineapple was a great match for the decadent foie.The next dish was a single ravioli of lobster and salmon arguably the best part of the meal. While small it hit just the spot. For the next course, we had the choice between the pork fillet and belly or a fillet of beef. I chose the later, which was quite tender and delicious, and those who ordered the pork were clearly jealous. For dessert, we had not one, but I kid you not 6 different courses. It was a bit much, but I think as it was closing time, they were giving us samples of all the desserts on the menu. The main attraction of this parade of desserts was the Chocolate Sphere. The waiters would come by with hot chocolate and pour it over the sphere, which quickly melted revealing the ice cream centre. Needless to say I left stuffed.Overall, this Petrus is a great spot for high-end dining in Knightsbridge, a worthy destination when you're in the need for a decadent meal.",

We opted for a Jura white @ \u00a356.Lowlights:- Small-ish portions - While nobody in our party left hungry, the foie gras starter and the venison loin entree were ridiculously tiny. \u00a0They both should have been double in portion size.- Confusing menu - we opted for the 3 course a la carte menu but were told *while ordering* that only 2 courses could be picked off that menu and a third dessert course could be chosen later after the meal. \u00a0It would have been nice if this was explained to us prior to ordering or if the menu had additional verbiage.- Not much description or explanation about menu items upon ordering or while being served. It would have been nice to hear where items came from and how they are prepared.- Too much salt - we are not salt sensitive, but a couple of items were overtly overly seasoned. \u00a0As a result, one of our fish entrees was comped by the restaurant, which was much appreciated.",

I treated the BF to a surprise birthday dinner here. After sitting down we were greeted with canap\u00e9s and an amuse-bouche. The canap\u00e9s were a small, but delicious start to the dinner and the flavours of the amuse bouche left an amazing after taste in my mouth. I had the quail starter which, to be honest tasted like chicken, however the au jus poured over the quail was packed full of flavour. My main of venison was absolutely gorgeous and melted in my mouth. The sides of dauphinoise potatoes and vegetables were a great compliment to the main. \u00a0The chocolate sphere dessert was like heaven in a bowl. I could have easily skipped the whole meal and eaten only the dessert. They brought out a little cake with a candle in it for the BF's birthday which was really lovely, and after dessert they came out with these little white chocolate lollipops. The servers were all super nice and helpful and we even got a tour of the kitchen after dinner. The ambiance was small and intimate, however it would have been nice to have some light music playing in the background. The wine we had was one of the cheaper bottles, but still tasted very nice. It's quite expensive, but a good treat to yourself for a special occasion.",

    "text": "I'm being terribly honest as usual but unusually I'm saddened to rate this restaurant 3.5 stars but in this circumstance it is deserving only of such. Being a massive Gordon Ramsey fan, I finally get to dine at one of his Michelin starred restaurants when given the chance to book this place. Yes, reservations are required. In fact they're so required I had a great many correspondence back and forth via email just to confirm reservation. Already I'm wondering if I should interpret that as thorough or pedantic.We arrived on time, our coats were cloaked and we seated and offered drinks and canapes immediately. We were seen to by already three different ma\u00eetre d' staff by this point. Almost to stump them, we ordered simple diet coke and freshly squeezed orange juice and I asked to see the drinks/cocktail menu. I never saw the drinks menu until long after the cola had been served which was nearly at entree arrival and they brought out the wine menu instead.Food menus were brought out and a waitress explained choices of 6 course tasting menu or 3 course al a carte. We went with the 3 course.Now if I could go back in a time machine I would not order any of the dishes I chose but other choices that appealed more, so I ended up doing the \"safe choice\" route.We ordered:Entree: dorset crab with avocado, radish and pink grapefruit and roasted Norfolk quail with foie gras, pancetta and charred lettuce.Main: roasted fillet of Cornish cod with peas, pickled onion and sauce gribiche and rack of Herdwick lamb with pomme puree, artichoke and wild garlic.Dessert: Coconut parfait with dark chocolate and lime and black forest with kirsch mousse, Amarena and Morello cherry sorbet.Before the entrees they served two canapes each, a mediocre bread basket and a palate cleanser and before the dessert they served another palate cleanser. The pre-dessert palate cleanser, if toothpaste could be made into fine dining edible format, that was how I pictured it and it tasted like such.Disquietingly, my dorset crab was so very inedible, it was served like a tartare with additional bits of cucumber balls and pea and pea shoots. The worse part was how un-fresh it tasted. I can only assume a restaurant of this calibre serves fresh crab from their kitchens but they had somehow managed to turn it into a canned crab taste. The only saving grace was the avocado and the grapefruit sauce, but I couldn't finish this dish.My partner enjoyed his quail greatly and only wished there were more of it. The main downfall for this restaurant and this course was the wait staff, in particular our waitress. Their snobby attitude was very offputting and almost laughable, I mean we are the customers, just because we don't look like Michelin men doesn't mean treat us like we shouldn't be there. So with this \"lovely\" vibe up in the air, we dined. One bizarre occurrence was that the waitress performed the final touches of the sauces on our entrees at the table. She did not demonstrate the same skill or finesse that a chef would. So inept was she, her hand dislodged several quail from their original positions on the plate as she splashed the sauce on top. What a unsettling concept, a Michelin star restaurant relying on their waiters to finalise the sauces on their dishes. I would've much preferred to either have the sauce poured by a professional chef or set aside for myself to add at my own leisure. Not some attitude-filled waitress in a rush to go back to standing and chatting with her fellow staff members and pretend to look like their doing something.For main, the Cornish cod was actually bearable and the pea puree was tasty, however that sauce gribiche was probably one of the worse sauces I've ever seen and tried. I had one spoonful and it took everything in me not to spit that back out. Unfortunately, once again, the waitress just shoved the sauce all over the cod, ruining my fish for the dish. My partner said that the sauce smelt so bad he wanted to ask my dish to be removed from the table. His lamb wasn't a rack but two small lamb chops which were 40% fat and not rendered. Not the ideal way he enjoys lamb, maybe for others, but very disappointing. He said the best bit was the puree.Then came dessert, now at this point I was praying the dessert would make up for everything so far. For my partner, whom had the coconut parfait, it was. His only wish was that there were more of it. My black forest however, ugh why did I choose the chocolate?! It was heavy, infused and tasted like a block of mousse you can buy at a pastry shop. Amarena cherries are officially a turn off for me now. The only bearable part of that dish was the sorbet.The wait staff made unnecessary amount hassle about my second order of orange juice, apparently they were concerned whether they had enough. Really? You don't keep fresh oranges onsite at your Michelin star restaurant? That small incident sums up the impression of this restaurant: over complicated fine dining.",

    "text": "If you've been following my reviews for a while, you'll know that we typically do a ton of research (which usually includes a bracket) when trying to choose a restaurant in a different city. This was no different - we were celebrating our anniversary while in London (well, to be fair - we celebrated our anniversary in every city we hit on this trip), and we knew we wanted something special.Our research started with a broad field of places, and in short order, they started to blend together. Then, we saw one of Chef Ramsay's restaurants, and we perked up. Soon enough, we were comparing his restaurants only, and had settled on Petrus.We were excited to try one of his restaurants. We were excited that it is Michelin-starred. We were intrigued by the menu options, and fully expecting a fantastic meal and evening.We had a late reservation on our final night in London, as we wanted to be sure we had time to get back to the hotel to get cleaned up after a day spent exploring. So, gussied up and ready for a good meal, we hit the tube and walked our way to the restaurant.It doesn't look like much from the outside, but once we stepped through that front door, the magic hit.We were given a friendly greeting, our coats were taken, and we were shown to a table in the back. There isn't much of a view (unless you like looking at the street and a restaurant across the way), but I actually liked the ambiance inside. It was open, dim without being obnoxious, with kind of an eclectic feel.It didn't take much consideration for us to decide on the tasting menu, and of course we paired that with the wine selections (the classic wines - no need to get crazy, now). After ordering, we sat back and waited to be awed. And awed we were!Chef's compliments came out first - a toast with thinly sliced mushrooms and a fried ball of deliciousness started out the evening (I'm almost certain they'd call those two things something completely different...) The mushrooms on toast sounds simple, but it was quite delicious. The mushroom was very thinly sliced, and there was a sauce - not too overpowering - between them and the toast that held it all together. Next up was an amuse bouche of Yuzu Chawanmushi, which was a custard in miso soup. It was interesting. Course one was Norfolk quail with morels, pancetta and charred lettuce, to which they added an au jus. The quail was good, but kind of difficult to get off the bone. I was afraid I'd be hacking at it with my fork and knife, only to have it go flying off the plate, skittering over the tablecloth, before ending up on the floor.Course two was an Orkney scallop with braised kombu, bacon and egg sabayon, which was very good. Scallops can be really hit or miss with me, but I was pleased to find that this one was perfectly cooked, and paired really well with the kombu and bacon bits.Course three was a small piece of Cornish brill, covered in cuttlefish and served with a cep Bolognese. This dish was my favorite by far. The brill and the cuttlefish worked really well together, and the sauces helped bring out the flavors, instead of being too overpowering. I'd order that dish again.For course four, we both chose the Herdwick lamb, which was presented perfectly cooked and accompanied by a miso gratin, soy beans, pickled mouli and a another au jus. It was hard to remember what was what once the plate was set in front of me, so all I remember is wishing there was another piece of lamb on the plate.Our palate cleanser was a lemon meringue, done fancy style. The meringue on top of the lemon foam was light and airy, and the lemon wasn't too strong (not that there's such a thing for me, but the hubs typically isn't a fan of citrus).Dessert was pure craziness. It was a black forest cake - again, done fancy-style. The mousse was rich and creamy, and the cherry sorbet was a perfect, not-too-tart complement to the decadent chocolate. They even created some realistic-looking cherries to serve on top. It was divine.And just when I felt like having one more bite would surely split the seams of my new dress, they brought out four truffles. I think they were some kind of dark chocolate ginger, but I really couldn't tell you, having opted to save the dress. And wouldn't you know, right after the truffles, they brought out a coconut-something nougat. I was in the middle of trying to talk myself into trying a bite of at least one of them, if not both, when they brought out another couple pieces of chocolate in celebration of our anniversary!At this point, I turned to my husband and told him that if they tried to bring one more dish, I'd stab their fingers with the chocolate truffle.Thankfully, they showed mercy on my poor (expanding) stomach, and ended the meal there. We were stuffed, but more importantly, we were impressed. Every item they set in front of us was beautifully presented and enjoyable to consume.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that the food and wine were both amazing which is the important part. However, the difference between a restaurant with 1 Michelin star and a restaurant with 3 is often service and atmosphere. The good is generally phenomenal at all of them.We opted for the tasting menu with the wine pairing which consisted of 2 amuse bouches and 6 courses, including 2 desserts, one being their signature. The scallops were amazing and the cod was the best fish I've ever eaten. The lamb was delicious but I wasn't wow'd which was slightly disappointing as it was the main course.The real trouble came with the service. Now let's start off by saying we showed up pretty early for our reservation, but it's not the type of place that turns over tables and the gladly seated us early. There is an art to top-quality service where you are present but not visible. The wait staff at Petrus does not subscribe to this theory. They would be constantly doing laps around the restaurant, always looking at your table and making eye contact. Especially early in the service this was very uncomfortable. It became less noticeable as the restaurant filled up but it left a bad impression.I will say that we were very fortunate and were given a brief tour of the kitchen and introduction to the head chef which was absolutely above-and-beyond. I almost feel bad giving them 4 stars but I really felt like the service could have been less intrusive.",

    "text": "This was my first Michelin star experience and did not disappoint!Being a big fan of Gordon Ramsay, I searched far and wide for reservations to his restaurants months before going to London and got a coveted reservation at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, but due to unfortunate circumstances, I had to cancel it and could not find anything for months. Luckily, Petrus was there to save my dream of dining at a GR Restaurant with a perfect reservation time! After looking at the menu, I knew I made the right choice.As soon as we showed up, we were warmly welcomed, the servers taking our jackets and guiding us to our table. The restaurant was pretty empty at this point. We chose the tasting menu which actually is cheaper than a three-course meal at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay (even though we are treating ourselves, it's good to know!). With the tasting menu, we got about eight courses along with some amuse bouches!Everything was impeccable: service, timing, temperature, DELICIOUSNESS! My favorite dishes of the night were definitely the foie gras and the dessert. The foie gras was huge! You can't find foie gras like that anywhere for the price you're paying. Before the entrees, we were served scallops and fillet of brill. I usually don't like cooked fish (only sashimi/sushi please!) but this was the most amazing fish I've ever had, it melted like butter in my mouth. I wish all fish tasted like that. For entrees, my mother and I ordered the duck, while my dad ordered the pork belly. Both were amazing. We refreshed our palette with a light pre-dessert of lemon meringue and onto the most amazing part, the dessert: the amazing, famous melting chocolate sphere! Servers poured hot fudge over this shiny, chocolate ball which melted away to reveal ice cream and honeycomb. To this day, I still dream about this dessert. There are a few imitations here in the US, but they can't compare to something straight out of a Gordon Ramsay restaurant!After dessert, we ordered cheese and fruit which were quite yummy and fresh. We also ordered a cappuccino and they were nice enough to not only give us truffles on dry ice but also a box of chocolates to go with the coffee! Wow!PS: The waitress, noticing we were American, was so thoughtful and kind to print out little menus of everything we ate and give them to us as souvenirs! That is some true Michelin star service right there!",

    "text": "This was my second visit to Petrus. The first was about 9 months ago. I couldn't have been happier with my first visit, excepting the over-attentive waitstaff. I still think about that earlier meal, and I eagerly reported to my foodie friends, \"No this guy isn't hype; he really can cook\" (Chef Ramsey, just in case you were waiting for my review).This time, it wasn't a repeat 5 stars. I'd give it a three. \u00a0The meal was good, it just wasn't spectacular. \u00a0I ate from the three-course lunch special. For the first course, I had Cornish cod brandade agnolotti, charred onion, wild garlic. The taste was there, it's just that all three agnolotti tasted slightly different and one was a bit watery. Also, it was a tad lukewarm for my taste.For the second course I had Slow roasted sucking pig, cuddle fish, charred pineapple, cider jus. The suckling pig was cooked to perfection; I wish as much attention had been given to the butchery. I found my portion a bit grisly. \u00a0Admittedly, I'm not familiar with cuddle fish. I found it well-seasoned, but just a bit tough and chewy. I would have preferred my texture in a different accompaniment. For dessert, I had the Millionaire shortbread, ginger ice cream. The ice cream was delicious. The shortbread was layered (from bottom to top) shortbread, caramelized chocolate mousse, and a chocolate layer. Chef Ramsey made a very delicious candy bar. That's what it reminded me of, and not something I'd order (if I known).",

Where was it. \u00a0Most of the food could have used a nice heap of extra seasoning. \u00a0French food should have some underlying smooth subtle flavors that pop out right at the perfect moment when your tongue mingles with a savory piece of meat. \u00a0This place? \u00a0Bland. \u00a0It is like the English inspired it.... oops this is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant...maybe it was my mistake.I can't complain about the staff- they get a five star rating. \u00a0But you don't come to a restaurant for the staff or even the \"ambiance\" (which this restaurant is nothing special to be honest) you come for the food.I spent almost three weeks in the UK, and this was on the same food level as a pub I ate at in Wales...actually the pub was better.. If you want amazing inspired food in London, go to Tamrind, which also had scallops on the menu with real flavoring and the money was well spent.",

Probably not the single best plate of food I've encountered but from the moment we sat we were constantly wowed with the cuisine & drink. The setting is quite intimate and comfortable all set around a fabulous wine room/display/work of art. The staff were extremely attentive, hospitable, and knowledgeable. If you're looking for an exceptional dining experience give P\u00e9trus a chance to make you say WOW.",

    "text": "I hate to give this place 3.5 stars because I was really excited to try this restaurant. I've been to a Gordon Ramsey restaurant in Las Vegas & loved it so I was anticipating another amazing meal here. We ordered the 3 course meal for lunch to get the full experience. The meal started with a complimentary Beef Tea. It was just as interesting/weird as it sounds. The Beef Tea was made for aroma. And yes, it was poured from a teapot. It was actually really cool to see it being presented on the table. \u00a0 APPETIZERI ordered the Foie Gras Parfait as my starter, which was actually a substitute for one of the starters. It was SOO GOOD! All of the ingredients together was amazing...the bread, figs, pistachio, crispy panchetta, flower petals, & herbs. It was way beyond my expectation! The flavors balanced one another & the flowers filled your mouth with the aroma of the food. I could've eaten this for the rest of my meal. ENTREEFor my second dish, I ordered the Filet of Cornish Hake with smoked mussels and Merlot sauce. The only part I loved about this dish were the mussels. Overall, the dish was wayyy too salty for me. :( The Cornish Hake was perfectly cooked, but it was already salty and it was wrapped in seaweed nori, which made it more salty. I thought the Merlot sauce would've toned down the saltiness, but it was salty too! I tried the breaded balls (potato?) in the dish & that was REALLY salty. I felt really bad to tell the server after he noticed I didn't finish it & asked if everything was ok. The server was very kind to ask if they could remake it for me or offer me something else. DESSERTFor dessert, I preordered the selection of cheese (\u00a310 supplement). The server asked what my preference was for cheese & I said I like strong cheese. I should've chosen my words more wisely because I definitely met my match and I absolutely LOVE cheese. The server cut me a slice of the Stinking Bishop. It was, BY FAR, the strongest cheese I've ever had & I would like to meet someone who could handle it. Challenge anyone? The server joked if you put this cheese in the fridge, you have to throw the fridge away afterwards. Lol! All of the other cheeses I tried were great. I think the server cut me thick slices to make up for my entree. This is my warning!! Be cautious of what you get into when you say you want strong cheese. My husband's dessert of the Coffee & Hazelnut Parfait with Amaretto jelly & Frangelico ice cream was beautiful & delicious. Our meal ended with complimentary Chocolate, Caramel Truffles. The service was EXCELLENT! I'd give service 5 stars if could because they were very attentive and kind. They made the whole experience luxurious. If only the food wasn't too salty, I think it would've tasted much better. It wasn't just the food that I ordered...my husband's Beef Wellington was cooked perfectly, but it also left a salty aftertaste. The Foie Gras Parfait set the standard high for the rest of my meal.",

This Ramsey restaurant has good quality food at reasonable prices (\u00a375-95 per head) and the service was wonderfully friendly without being obtrusive. The current menu is simple and interesting and I particularly enjoyed the lemon sole. The Black Forrest desert was wonderfully decadent only matched by the complimentary lemon meringue. Thank you to the assistant Head Sommelier Masa for looking after us too :-)",

    "text": "My friend and I wanted to try a Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, but wasn't prepare for beef wellington yet, so we choose Petrus's set lunch as a first :)I've heard some criticisms of Petrus: how it is obviously created and designed to get a Michelin star. HOWEVER, this doesn't have to be a bad thing for diners! I think overall Petrus is a very good restaurant to start to get a taste of Michelin. It was consistent and well-rounded in all elements (food, decoration, service, atmosphere, etc), and screamed \"This is Michelin one star!\"Set lunch was reasonably priced, 3 course with 2 or 3 choices for each, and complimentary starter and chocolate. Each dish were decorated beautifully and very photogenic. They also had multiple layers and textures. There were some surprises, and yet the taste weren't too adventurous to the point that we weren't sure if we like the taste or not--a pretty common feeling I encountered when I ate at a Michelin restaurant, heh. Our mains (duck and lamb) were pretty solid, and desserts were wonderful and delicious! There were also different types of bread, which I always love!Amazing service that made you feel you are dining in an upscale restaurant for a special occasion, but didn't suffocate and overly fancy or pretentious for no particular reason. The decor is very classy but comfortable. We had a good time enjoying our lunch while chatting and catching up. The food may not be groundbreakingly creative or with wow factor all around, but I think it is a safe restaurant to recommend to people who want to spend money on trying out a taste of Michelin--the people who aren't usually as welling to spend $$$$, not very adventurous or travel a long way just to try out certain food.",

    "text": "I'm definitely not an expert at reviewing fine dining experiences let alone Michelin Star ones but I can definitely say that my night at Petrus could not have gone any better. My boyfriend and I came here for my birthday dinner and I still cannot stop thinking about this place!The service was impeccable from the moment we stepped into the restaurant till the end. Everything on the menu sounded delicious but we were determined to get the full experience here so we both chose the Discovery of Petrus Tasting Menu (7 courses). The wine menu was huge as was the physical glass-encased wine room in the middle of the restaurant. Luckily, we had a knowledgeable sommelier help us pick a red wine to go with our meal.Shortly after we ordered, we got to try two complimentary starters which were both so good and completely raised my expectations for the rest to come. I could go on and on about each dish but we both felt that our favorite was the heirloom tomato salad with mackerel tartare, smoked creme fraiche and basil. The combination of ingredients was unexpected but worked so well together to create the fresh and unique flavors. My second favorite was the Roast Veal Sweetbread with almond and gooseberry. The veal was tender, buttery and bursting with flavor. The almond sauce was so delicious, I wanted more! My boyfriend also loved the Seared Orkney Scallop with braised kombu, bacon and egg sabayon. The giant palm-sized scallop was perfectly cooked and tasted so fresh. All the toppings were really flavorful but didn't overpower the scallop either.For dessert, I couldn't get enough of the raspberry souffle. The souffle was warm and filled with light fluffy sweetness in a crispy outer shell and a scoop of raspberry and rosemary ice cream in the middle. My boyfriend thought it was a bit too sweet but I loved that the flavors were bold. We also enjoyed the pre-dessert and the little treat after our dessert.Our night at Petrus exceeded all my expectations. In short, you won't regret getting the tasting menu. I also found out from our waiter that they have a chef's table experience (minimum party of 4) and this is now something I want to come back for!",

    "text": "As a newbie to the Michelin Star dining experience, I don't know that I can write a review worthy of our experience. \u00a0But it certainly makes me want to keep trying Michelin restaurants! \u00a0We were a bit early for our reservation, but everyone made a fuss over us when we arrived. \u00a0The decor was fairly minimal...definitely more modern in nature with the focal point being the wine display in the centre of the restaurant. \u00a0Mr. Snarky is able to pull off the 'I'm here, impress me' vibe... meanwhile I'm like the kid who has finally been allowed to sit at the adults' table. \u00a0We were provided with the wine menu in addition to the food menu... it was massive. \u00a0I decided to have a cocktail to start with while Mr. Snarky had his usual Diet Coke.We were tempted by nearly everything on the menu, but in the end, we did want the full experience, so we chose the Discovery of Petrus Tasting Menu. \u00a0The waiter asked us if we had any food allergies/intolerances, so I mentioned that I am lactose intolerant, but asked if they could just consult me on any dishes with dairy because mine isn't straightforward... and they did so I was able to make a decision on whether or not to have the original dish or a modified dish! \u00a0I can't tell you how annoyed I get that lactose intolerances are treated all the same and that restaurants don't consult their customers to fully understand it, so I really appreciated that the waiter checked with me before each dish.They brought us some bread, butter, and some warmed olive oil from Provence. \u00a0The olive oil was beautiful... it had a floral quality to it, a hint of lavender. \u00a0They kept asking if we wanted more bread, but we were not there to fill up on bread ;). \u00a0There were two amuse bouches, one of which was a soup. \u00a0Because of my lactose intolerance, I had a consomme made of mushrooms. \u00a0I never understood the allure of a consomme, until now. \u00a0I could happily have a bowl of it!I asked the sommelier if he could recommend a full bodied red wine. \u00a0Originally I thought about adding the wine pairings to my tasting menu, but the last time I had wine pairings, I ended up with loads of unfinished glasses on the table because I only enjoyed a couple of them, so I thought best to stick with one... or two glasses. \u00a0I don't know the name of the wine, but it was the best glass of wine I have ever had. \u00a0There was a hint of spice making it warm, but it had a lovely dark berry flavour. \u00a0It was smooth and it didn't give me heartburn. \u00a0Mr. Snarky later told me it was a \u00a340 glass of wine... so not something you drink while watching t.v. in your pajamas.I've decided to give some highlights of the dishes, otherwise we'll be here all night. \u00a0Mr. Snarky's favourite dish of the night was scallop with braised kombu, bacon, and egg sabayon. \u00a0My favourite dish of the night was the roast sweetbread with almond and black truffle. \u00a0Admittedly it was the dish I was the most worried about because I had never had a sweetbread before, but it was lovely! \u00a0The sweetbread was tender, almost buttery and the taste profile of the sweetbread with the almond and black truffle was so delicious that I wanted more. \u00a0Who knew I'd be a fan of sweetbreads?!The flavour combinations on the pigeon were a bit surprising... especially the avocado, but it was delicious. \u00a0Although there was a bit of tendon (or something) that was making it difficult to cut through. \u00a0I nearly had a 'Pretty Woman' moment, you know when she flicks the snail across the restaurant. \u00a0Fortunately my pigeon remained on my plate. \u00a0I was excited about the Raspberry souffle for dessert, but the waiter informed me that it was full of dairy, so I had the Caramelised Braeburn apple, lime, mint, and kiwi sorbet. \u00a0I did have a small bite of Mr. Snarky's Raspberry souffle, even though he didn't want to share at all. \u00a0The souffle was creamy, but light although I found the rosemary in the ice cream overpowering. \u00a0my dessert was not just beautiful to look at, but the way they were able to get such a strong flavour from the apples made it absolutely delicious. \u00a0And you have to eat each element together as they balance each other... sweet and tart. \u00a0If you want a dessert that isn't heavy, but is still sweet and rich, the Caramelised apple is the way to go.They also brought us a little treat at the end, blood orange fruit jellies. \u00a0I think they should box those up and sell them. \u00a0I'd definitely buy a box. \u00a0They would make great gifts, if I didn't eat them first. \u00a0The staff made us feel at ease and welcomed. \u00a0I think they were quite proud that they were our first Michelin Star experience. \u00a0When we told them it was our anniversary, they invited us down to see the kitchen. \u00a0I know it is probably rare, but I was really hoping Gordon would be in the kitchen yelling out profanities, but he wasn't. \u00a0However, I did see that they have a Chef's Table and that is now on my bucket list!",

Luxurious lemon-y sorbert dessert. Omgsogood. Warning - still AND sparking water cost a hefty \u00a36 per bottle, and the champagne they pour at the beginning is *not* free (derp...). If you don't care for paying extra for drinks, ask for tap, and make sure you really want the champagne! I chalk this up to a cultural misunderstanding, because in some of the restos in the States, still / sparkling water is free.",

Every course was like a magician performing a difficult trick and you have no idea how it\"s done. At one stage my brother went for a pee and while he was away from the table, they refolded his serviette.

Everything was phenomenal, my favorite was the lobster omelette, the roasted halibut, the chicken with foie gras. I wasn't too fond of the dessert, it was a raspberry cake with some mousse. Overall- service was amazing, dinner was fantastic. I would come back and try their a la carte menu in the future.",

Our sommelier was especially helpful and friendly - the white wine we had was so delicious.The dining room has classic simple decor, as with many michelin star restaurants, with a feature of a walk in wine cellar in the centre of the room.We had a few canapes to start which were all delicious while we enjoyed our glass of champagne. I had the cod agnolotti to start, which was really superb. Perfectly cooked.I then had the brill with new potatoes which was also very good - though i'd day good rather than amazing.I adored our palate cleanser of watermelon granita, melon and lime sorbet...so divine that I was making some rather expressive noises!Dessert was an absolute treat. The chocolate tart was so dark and moreish and the cheese plate was really excellent quality. A great selection of cheeses - the goats cheese was marvelous.Fantastic service, wine and food - the trifecta! I wholeheartedly recommend!",

They have a 3 courses lunch menu that's a good way to enjoy a Michelin star restaurant without breaking your bank. We each picked different items from starters, mains and desserts, so that we can try different dishes. \u00a0I had ravioli for starter, rack of lamb for main and raspberry tart and lychee sorbet for dessert. The creamy filling of the ravioli was simply delightful and tasty. The rack of lamb was quite simply the best lamb I had so far, even my husband liked it and he usually didn't like lamb. The meat was tender, flavorful with a slightly crispy outer layer. The garnish complimented the lamb perfectly. I can't find a single fault about the dish. My dessert was also amazing. The lychee sorbet was so silky in texture and so fragrant in taste. \u00a0The presentation of all the dishes were all so beautiful. It make me not want to break it up to eat. But once you taste them you instantly wanted more. My hubby's fish main course and chocolate ganache dessert were also extremely tasty. The fish was flaky and nice with a little \u00a0crunch on the top side. The chocolate dessert was delicious and not too sweet.The service was also impeccable here. They are attentive, nice and friendly. \u00a0We have had lunch at a 3 star Michelin restaurant in New York before. \u00a0I have to say this place is very bit as good as the 3 star restaurant. I didn't understand why do they only have 1 star. Dear Michelin guide rating folks, if you are seeing this review, please give them 2 more stars, they are worth it.",

All dishes came with a mini croquette with chives and a little soup. For my starter, I ordered a greens ravioli with duck egg yolk and a red wine sauce, the main a chicken dish with bourguignon sauce, and the dessert a grapefruit dessert with blood orange. The chicken was very tender and the grapefruit dish was very refreshing. In addition to the courses there were also palette cleansers in between. The first palette cleansers was a fried fish piece with a curry mayo. The palette cleansers \u00a0between the main and the dessert was a mango ice with cream of some sort. I did find a hair in mine which was disappointing. The last thing that they served us with a salted chocolate with some sort of cake inside. It was a bit sour and I wasn't too fond of it.Our server was very knowledgeable, courteous, and helpful. We were very full after the lunch so it was definitely money well spent.

For special occasions we try to find restaurants where someone we know from TV either is the executive chef or the owner. In this case, currently watching Master Chef, Gordon Ramsay was fresh on our minds for our holiday to London. The expectation was met perfectly by Petrus.Located in the embassy area of London, Petrus is tucked away down a side street (currently sort of blocked by construction on the sidewalk). Once inside, the circular room surrounds a glass wine cellar and gives those on the inside of the circle a very intimate setting.We had the prix fixe dinner menu which was very well thought out, hit both savory and sweet notes, and we opted to pair wine with each course. Shout out to the team of servers who were both attentive and discrete. Well done.",

The amuse bouche, the first three courses... amazing. And then they forgot about us. It was a good two hours for the sorbet and the gateau. We watched multiple other tables that were seated WELL AFTER us get served well in advance, while we sat there twiddling our thumbs for half an hour to 45 minutes. I don't know what the mixup was. But it turned an amazing dining experience into something that was soured. If the courses were timed correctly, it would have been perfect. Maybe it was a mixup that caused three tables to be served dessert of us, despite them being seated well after us and finishing their mains after us as well. But whatever the causes, when you're paying over \u00a3350 for dinner, it's these errors that you don't expect. Would have been 5 stars otherwise.",

I ordered the tartar, Beef Wellington with Foie Gras (an extra ~\u00a325), strawberry dessert, and Chocolate Sphere (yes... I ordered two desserts and I'll explain why later)The tartar came in multiple small pieces, and each has its own distinguishing flavor. I really, really enjoyed it a lot :) The beef Wellington was SO good!!!!!! The outside was the perfect amount of crispy and flaky, and the meet inside was just so tender. It wasn't too salty (which I find is a big problem in a lot of American restaurants back home), and was simply delish! Now I ordered the Gariguette Strawberry and Earl Grey trifle with strawberry sorbet. I literally got zero bites in before my friends Chocolate Sphere won me over. The chocolate sphere has milk ice cream and honeycomb in it, and sounds exactly as it sounds (look at the video I posted to see what I'm talking about). Hot chocolate is poured over the sphere, and the walls of the sphere slowly melts. I ordered my own sphere for ~\u00a310 and was sooooo happy as the waiter actually let me pour the hot chocolate on the sphere myself and even took a video of it for me (SUCH an awesome memory). On top of that, I absolutely loved the dessert itself as well. PS the pre-desert lemon meringue was phenomenal! The service was extraordinary- very friendly, yet professional. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal there! I only wish Gordon Ramsay had visited the restaurant when I was there (he had come in the day before!). Very much so deserving of its 5 star rating, and also of its Michelin star!",
