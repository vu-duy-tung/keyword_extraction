I am embarrassed/proud to say I've never had a fried chicken before and what enticed me is the fact is that chicken is not deep fried here but still has that buttery crust. We had an awesome time, the place is pretty cool inside, we ordered BBQ wings-yum, beef brisket-omg! Double yum, and corn bread-for me the highlight of the meal. Man that corn bread was so tasty, so soft-prefect. We had to have the specialist chicken and it was good, but that's about it. I would definitely come back but not for the chicken. Sorry, not been blown away.",

Nor is it, by any standard, southern. Think of it as a Londoners' interpretation of southern barbecue. The pulled pork plate comes with a thick cut slaw (okay so far), barbecue beans (with HUGE stew beans), rice (huh?!), and a grilled, naan-like flatbread (are you KIDDING me?!). The pork itself was fine but lacked any smoke flavor and the sauce the pork was cooked in was ... well ... meh. (My wife thought the sauce was more Mediterranean than American.)That said, the service was attentive and the portions were large. And while the meal wasn't what we expected, it was fine.",

The only two vegetarian dishes on the menu are a CHICK(PEA) BEAN BUN and a VEGETABLE GUMBO. I ordered the latter and was impressed by the yummy flavour and also enjoyed the corn bread muffin that came with it. So I really can't say anything against that and apart from the food we also liked the cocktails and had a nice waiter. I can't judge if it was an authentic New Orleans atmosphere because I've never been to the Southern states but it somehow didn't do it for me. Maybe it was the downstairs bar that we visited after dinner which gave it an overall less positive mark. At Cocktail Baby I had a Watermelon Martini which tasted so artificial to me that I could only sip on it a few times. Apart from our group, the bar was also completely empty, which ruined the atmosphere. I wonder why there was no one...",

We were prompted to order quickly and the food arrived before our drinks. Worst thing ever! Drinks should never arrive after the food. For a place that is suppose to be emulating an American dining experience Joe's falls short. It's a lively and eclectic place that has been done well. The men's toilets were clean however I found the troff to be somewhat 1970's football stadium restroom. Would you ask women to use a troff, seriously poor and barbaric design. So the food... the BBQ pulled pork was good. I found the BBQ sauce a bit sweet and I was disappointed only one type of sauce was offered. The veggies served on the side had a strange pickled flavor which I wasn't fond of and chose not to finish. My sandwich came on a plate with wax paper under the sandwich. My bread was wet on the bottom and mixed with the paper. I also ordered the watermelon and feta salad. Typically watermelon salads have no seeds from the watermelon but not this one. To confuse the eater further they sprinkle pumpkin seeds on the salad too. When you take a bite it's like Russian roulette with your fork. Joe's was largely a disappointment aside from their tasty pulled pork meat. I suppose this touristy style restaurant isn't my cup of tea. Maybe you'll like it but this American Southerner says no to Joe's, y'all.",

Thank God they took out most of the chicken option, as you could only get them until 6pm. We decided to go with a small portion of chicken wings (yummy) and shortbread with paprika butter for starters. Very small portions. We the decided for burgers, one prison plate and one coq of the week. All fairly nice, but not super great. The whole experience was a bit lacking from the start, as they couldn't provide one particular cocktail. At the end of the meal they were also very clearly trying to get us out (after only an hour at the table), as there were coming around a lot to ask if we need anything else and as soon as we got the bill they appeared with the credit card machine. They didn't even wait 10min. Not a nice atmosphere.",

The d\u00e9cor is very typical of a pubby/restaurant of anywhere from Tennessee to Texas right down to the uniforms of the serving staff. Their alcohol collection behind the bar is beyond impressive and their menu is vast. They also have a great little sheet for those with food allergies which ticks which items have gluten, dairy, nuts etc. Vegetarian options are also clearly listed. In true American style, the portions are huge and you get way more chicken than we were expecting which was a nice surprise. The potato mash is good, the potato roasties are a little spicy but delicious and the chicken gravy is super delish (and apparently gluten free!). The chicken isn't the best chicken we've had but it was certainly decent, especially for the centre of London. We were very intrigued by the chocolate fried chicken option on the specials menu but weren't \u00a0game enough to try it... definitely on the list for next time though! The music is great, and really adds to the American vibe. The biggest thing it did for me was make me really really miss my time in the Southern States, but at least I know there's a place I can go in London to get my Southern USA fix!",

In neon light, sitting on a barstool, the drinks menu gives you a metropolitan vibe with all the choices you could think of. Feel free to take the beverage you settled on upstairs as well, once your table is free.Upstairs the atmosphere is quite different, and goes more to the roots of the menu - reliably delicious (and fried) food - with a rustic appearance. My highest recommendation goes to the special Joe's sauce available next to regular condiments like ketchup and mayonnaise. It pairs well with fried chicken, chips and anything else you can think to batter.It can get quite loud, as Joe's Southern is a popular choice for dinner through its central location near plenty of theatres. If anything though, it's part of the charm of the place.",

I really enjoyer the Brooklyn Lager beer (served in a bottle) i had waiting for the food. I ordered sticky BBQ wings and chilli fries. The BBQ wings were decent (and sticky) but i was well disappointed with the chilli fries. They were way more spicy than i expected and from someone who really enjoys eating spicy that means a lot. It kind of ruined my palate and i couldn't enjoy eating as much with such a burning mouth. I think they should warn customers as of how spicy it actually is because i don't think a lot of people can handle that burn. Finally the fries themselves weren't tasty nor crunchy, fast food quality at most. The service was fast and attentive.",

We were also pestered quite a bit when we were getting ready to leave as someone wanted our table and were apparently being aggressive about it.

Yet I just don't think it's that finger licking good for me to spend 15\u00a3 on catfish. The Mac and cheese was great, just get the side as a whole plate of it would be way too much. The fried chicken was good but I've had way better. The funniest part of this menu is its beer selection which does not include a single Southern US brew. Ha! Also vegetarian gumbo is a sweet gesture to the veggie community but seafood gumbo is the only way to go from this Nola girl to you. All in all Joes has a fun vibe to it, great music tracks as well, but it does not really match up to its source and could improve.",

    "text": "This three-storey eatery boasts the kind of vibrant young atmosphere you'd expect from its location. With a large (and extremely tall!) bar plus a dance floor and more downstairs, Joe's certainly isn't a one trick pony. Our large group were quickly taken to our table on the top floor, overlooking the main bar. The decor, tables and jazzy music was in keeping with the 'southern' theme and felt authentic. Our waiter was incredibly enthusiastic and thrived off the atmosphere. Joe's menu is, like southern American food, in my opinion a bit limited; burgers, chicken and pulled pork covers most of it. \u00a0However, where the variety lacks perhaps, the portion sizes don't! My starter of BBQ chicken wings was substantial and very tasty and thankfully came with plenty of wipes. For main, I had the Prison platter which as the name suggests came on a brilliant metal tray with lots of sections. Tomatoey butter beans, crunchy coleslaw, smokey pitta and stringy pulled pork - prison food surely isn't this good! The portion size was huge and I sadly couldn't finish it all. Other mains (such as the burger) were smaller and definitely needed side dishes. Joe's is an exciting restaurant that does very simple food well. As expected for a eatery in London, it is expensive but you'll leave feeling full.",

Joe's Southern was and always is a great choice especially if you go during Happy Hour and get half price cocktails! They make a mean Mojito!The food is awesome. \"Broasted\" chicken which is brined in sweet tea. Amazingly crispy and juicy. Creamy mashed potatoes, French fries with chicken salt, a side of pulled pork and extra chicken gravy. Ooooooh my it was good!! Everything was improved by the house hot sauce which was nicely tangy if a little tame. They could definitely up the hot on the hot sauce.The service could be a little more attentive but it's adequate. All in all, I've enjoyed my visits to the restaurant and I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "We came here for my brothers 23rd birthday and due to our party size we booked well in advance. The booking was straight forward but the only thing to note is that you leave a \u00a350 deposit to safe guard any no shows but you do get this back when you turn up with your party. This place is a nice stroll from Covent Garden station \u00a0which is also a stone throw away from the Apple Store.Personally I feel this place is in a great location and benefits from the flow of shoppers and party goers. The decor of the place can be described as modern trendy as is reflected in the dress code of all the smart casually dressed people that visits the restaurant. I always tend to worry about set buffet style menus and if the food will actually be enough and I'll tell you this it was. I mean it really was. No one finished any of the three courses cleanly, I mean there was still something on the table that wasn't finished or even touched in some cases. Let's start with the starter, now it was a good starter as there was something for everyone due to the fact we had like five or six different things to choose from. My favourite was the popcorn shrimp but there was no chilli lime salsa and this was supposed to come with it, but it was nice none the less. A natural favourite for everyone was the chicken wings and no restaurant should be getting this wrong to be fair. Finally the total miss for me was the rice balls they were really rude, it was just texture of a crispy breadcrumb fried outside with a sticky gooey rice on the inside. It almost sounds like a dessert but it was far from a sweet tasting dessert it was just a bland tasting rice ball which had the potential to be amazing with the right seasoning as they already had the textures right. On to the mains which we had the lovely crispy fried chicken, but there was no Tabasco honey and this was suppose to come with it. The beer can free range chicken was alright but I can see the appeal for those who didn't want the typical southern fried chicken as the beer can chicken also had a BBQ rub on it. What was a hit on my side of the table was the mac 'n' cheese which they ordered seconds for, now yes I did like it myself but not as much as some. My personal hit was \u00a0the whipped potatoes mash with the chicken gravy, that for me was a simply nice smooth creamy mash that was a nice balance with the crispy chicken I was eating it with. I can only imagine if I had the Tabasco honey like I was supposed to of had with it, it would have been the perfect finisher for my plate. What I did find odd was when we were getting closer to the end of our main and our minds were already thinking if we actually have rooms in our stomachs for desserts, my brother \u00a0asked the waiter for BBQ sauce as his plate was as dry as mine, when I was eating it and it was at that moment the waiters brought out an assortment of sauces for us, but like I said we were like 5 minutes away from getting our desserts, so too little too late. What was the only real upsetting feature of the night was that we were placed by the front entrance where the red leather sofa seats are and literally one or two of us was getting water splashed on our heads from the aircon that was directly above our heads. So a word of warning is to try and avoid those seats as the water from above can and will land in your food and drink as it happened to us. It was so bad that the waiter had to completely replace one of our food and drink which was fantastic and really helpful of him but unfortunately this meant that they had to wait for a fresh order meaning they were slightly behind compared to the rest of us. I cannot understand why they would have the aircon on next to an open door? It defeats the purpose. You can't \u00a0condition the atmosphere of the environment if there are doors and windows open, it's like putting the cold aircon on in your car and driving with the windows down, it is a pointless waist of time and it logically makes no sense. Moving on to the desserts and out of the selection my personal favourite was supposed to be the brownie and ice cream but surprisingly enough it was the pecan pie and cream that I have never had before which I thought was absolutely smashing. It had textured cream and a pastry bottom, really good stuff. I noticed the other side of the group didn't really touch what was my favourite. \u00a0The drinks menu was great even for people like myself that does not drink alcohol. I had the joes creamy lilt, which had lilt, ginger, cream, ice and a slice of pineapple for good measure. In summary the positives were the drinks, shrimps, crispy southern fried chicken and the whipped potatoes. The negatives were the aircon, rice balls dry food due to missing Tabasco honey and missing chilli lime salsa sauces. I hope to come again and try from the normal menu as the set menu tries to please everyone but falls slightly short due to service. If the set menu could be tweaked within budget then it would be great.",

I'm veggie so it wasn't an ideal choice to start with :p I had the goats cheese watermelon salad which was a giant bowl of spinach with a weird combo of toppings. Also the southern fried potatoes were hard and not tasty. I sent them back and got some fries which were very very yummy! So a bit of a ho hum meal for me, but the staff were lovely and helpful and the meat eaters seemed fairly satisfied.",

I made the mistake of ordering the BBQ bun because when I saw the Nashville hot half bird that someone else on my table ordered, I suddenly realised that I am very hungry. While my burger was great, I had a piece of the half chicken which was definitely better! It was also a much larger portion than what we were expecting. The side of my Mac'n'Cheese did make it all better. For those looking for some good southern comfort food, I would definitely try this place out!",

My boyfriend had gone to the bathroom when I requested the bill. The waiter was pretty reluctant to actually give me the bill when he came back with it and I told him I would pay it now. He asked me if it was OK, and I was pretty confused. He pointed to my boyfriend's empty chair and said 'Is it OK with him?'. The BBQ beans were also pretty tasty once we convinced the waiter that we had ordered them, not corn. Would recommend this place for chicken wing lovers and with people still stuck in the 1950s.",

I've had a fried chicken wing or two, I dare say and unfortunately, Joe's did not live up to my expectations. As moist as the meat was the \"fried\" in their fried chicken consisted of a bread crumb coating. Not a fan and not authentic of southern fried chicken. I wanted the crazy crunch from a thick flour batter but no luck. Plus it was pretty bland tasting overall. My cornbread was extremely dense and perhaps it is personal preference but cornbread should have a nice crust and be crumbly, not dry, on the inside. The general experience was fun for my English other half as he's never had American southern food but for me I wasn't impressed. The waitress we had that evening was quite slow and inattentive as well. \u00a0She never remembered our drink order until another waitress noticed our distress. \u00a0I do forget to mention that I booked our reservations via Square Meal and got 50% off the bill so big plus! Anywho, this place is kitschy enough for non-Americans and as I prefaced in this review, I said id be biased :)",

    "text": "Fine staff let down by a poor menu and disastrous food. On any other day, having seen the menu I would have left the restaurant, but seeing as we were hungry we decided to stick it out. Overpriced and bearing little resemblance to a southern menu, we chose the least offensive looking item: their house burger (medium rare) with chicken salt fries (those were extra). The offer of their special milkshake, containing apple pie and peanut butter along with a whole host of other ingredients, was eschewed in favour of water - a good decision, as I soon found out I'd need gallons of the stuff to wash the 'food' down.When the burgers came, they were both \u00a0reduced to a cinder block and cooked well done throughout - unlike the waiter, you'll remember I asked for medium rare. My friend remarked that it tasted like they didn't clean the grill, which was gracious of him as it actually tasted much worse. At this point, we struggled between us whether to complain and leave or take the hit, and fill our empty stomachs with our charcoal patties. Somehow we decided upon the latter - I can only assume our collective hunger had made us light headed.While I'll admit the fries were absolutely fine, the ordeal cost us almost \u00a345 and a great deal more in trauma. We will not be returning.",

    "text": "Somewhat another tourist trap. My boyfriend and I were craving some fried chicken and using the Tastecard we discovered this place, located in the central of Covent Garden which was convenient to get to. It is a really nice venue, cool trendy dark American wooden decor, red leather seating, all very comfortable. It was a nice atmosphere and a good vibe. We were seated inside where things got a bit narrow. I didn't particularly enjoyed the view of the sink/store room area but I suppose it can't be helped unless they cover it with blinds. Food was definitely quite overpriced without the Tastecard, especially for the quality we received. We started off with some Corn and Monterey Jack rice balls and Joe's Chicken Wings both priced at \u00a35.95. As light and crispy the rice balls were, they lacked flavour, quite bland and the consistency was too runny. Chicken wings was on the other side of the spectrum with it's overly salted breadcrumb batter, not evenly covering the chicken and the chicken itself being quite bland. It was helped the Tabasco honey that gave it a good sweetness and kick of spice. The chicken itself was also very tender, cooked perfectly which meant that both the starters were edible but not much difference from the local chicken shop in my area.For the mains we shared another portion of Joe's Southern fried chicken. The batter was a lot better this time round, crispier and thicker whilst maintaining the tenderness of the chicken. But still it was the only thing that gave the chicken taste and too average to be charging \u00a312.50 for four pieces. Beef ribs were overcooked and dry around the edges. Those on the bone marbling around the layer of fat was more successful, soft, succulent and tender but the rest was too dense and tough and was definitely not worth \u00a316.95 after what was left. I was quite disappointed with the presentation of some of our foods as well, especially our mash which did not look appetising. My boyfriend found it a bit rude but luckily it tasted fine. Chicken was also just thrown in a bowl and beef ribs on a wooden plank with no extra touches. A bit of salad on the side or arrangement would have been nice. Luckily service was very friendly by our waiter and I think he made our experience a lot better than what it could have been. Overall an average easy going meal but not somewhere I would return to for American food or recommend it for that cuisine. Still 3 stars but being edible, the cool decor and the service.",

    "text": "Still...digesting. \u00a0Southern-style food has been slowly creeping in over the last couple of years, and with places such as The Fat Bear and Stax as well as various street food traders opening up, people now know what shrimp'n'grits are. \u00a0Hooray! \u00a0Perhaps it's an indicator that the end of days is well on the way, what with the popularity of excessive cuisines, but, well, it's all rather good. \u00a0Joe's is a pretty big space (very high ceiling, and a high spirits shelf too for good measure) with \u00a0decidedly polished cosy decor (no pretence of being a rustic shack here). They do have metal tables, but the dim lighting feels more trendy than dive bar-esque. \u00a0The menu is pretty extensive and it was hard to narrow down the choices - about 15 different snack/starters, a selection of burgers, fried chicken, beer can chicken (beer can or bacon?), about 8-10 mains ('prison dinner' pulled pork, mac'n'cheese...), sides, and steak-of-the-day (today being a 41-day aged British one. \u00a0Sounded tempting...). \u00a0The cocktails looked good, but we didn't have any (hungover dining buddy ;) ). \u00a0I had a lemongrass lemonade instead which was ok - a bit sweet for my tastes, but enjoyable nonetheless.We went for popcorn shrimp, half a fried chicken, the buffalo chicken burger, collard greens, chicken salt fries, and mashed potato. \u00a0The popcorn shrimp was ok - I thought they were a bit soggy and the outside could have been crunchier. \u00a0I did like the accompanying tangy green salsa though. \u00a0The buffalo chicken burger was decent, it was more blue cheese than buffalo, but enjoyable nonetheless. \u00a0I did devour it pretty damn quickly, so I didn't necessarily take the time to savour it in the same way...The fried chicken is the centrepiece and it's pretty good. \u00a0The skin is crispy, the chicken is well-flavoured - it's satisfying. \u00a0I found the large breast piece got a bit dry, but the other pieces were fine, and given the decent flavour of it I thought it forgiveable. \u00a0I'm a bit on the fence about the lemon dust on the chicken - not that it's bad, but it does have a slightly artificial flavour to it, and I might have just preferred normal lemon. I liked the sides - the fries were good, chicken salt always goes down well for me, the whipped potato was also good (maybe could have had a bit more gravy, but I wasn't too bothered).Overall, I enjoyed my experience here and it was just what I needed today. \u00a0It didn't blow me away, but I came out really satisfied - moreso than, say, the Big Easy - and would be happy to come back and try some of the other things here, especially the pulled pork and beef rib. It's not cheap (\u00a325 a head), but that's not necessarily out of line with similar places. \u00a0Still plenty of things to try for my next visit, so I expect I'll be back soon in the near future.",

The waiter was nice and attentive, too!The only reason I took a star off was because it was good but not actually what most southern restaurants would have or wasn't how that dish would be prepared. Kind of a European's idea of southern food, if you will. The main culprit would be the fried pickles. They were good, but the long spears aren't what you would ever find in many restaurants in my neck of the woods, though. Overall, I liked the restaurant and liked the atmosphere of the place.

We opted for familiar spinach and artichoke dip, chicken wings, chicken, French fries. It was all okay, and VERY expensive for a lackluster experience. We felt stupid for expecting it to hold a candle to anything from the US, and it basically was the equivalent of probably a bar in he US selling British food. Good enough, but way off the mark. We spent 90 pounds for not a lot of food, and certainly would never return.",

We walked in and there were only two other tables with people at them, we were not greeted immediately but we didn't have to wait long to be seated. \u00a0 Once seated, we were given menus and a drink menu, our waitress came over to ask if we wanted drinks, and seemed annoyed with us when we asked for a moment before ordering so that we could all look at the drink menu. I decided to splurge on the \u00a315 Cherry Lincoln, which was supposed to come in a cup shaped like US president Abe Lincolns head/face. I got my drink in George Washingtons head instead, no big deal. The drink itself was a joke, it literally tasted like it was just juice (is this an English thing, make the cocktails weak so they'll drink a pint of beer instead??). \u00a0I felt cheated out of my \u00a315, the juice wasn't even good and they put SO much ice in it, I broke 3 straws before the drink was gone. The food was decent, it arrived quickly and it was nice and hot. The \"Coq and Balls\" was ok, very crumbly and it had an odd taste, possibly from the chipotle seasoning? \u00a0I also ordered the Frickles, which are just fried pickle spears, definitely better than some I've had here in the states and the dipping sauce that came with them was quite good as well.",

We shared the southern fried chicken - lots of meat with a reasonably nice coating (could have had more flavour) but they coated it in parsley which I hate! We ordered Mac and cheese which was sooo cheesy with a nice crusty crumb topping - a recommendation! Also got the bbq pulled pork butter beans which I had high expectations but they were really watery. Not what I had hoped for! Good beer selection and I have been for cocktails at happy hour before which are very tasty.Friendly staff and reasonably priced lunch at \u00a315 each but I'm afraid it didn't wow me! I do want to go back to try a few other cocktails and some of the other dishes so it can't be that bad!",

Not to coin my mothers phrase but, \"I couldn't hear myself think\", never mind hear Jody across the table!But it was a Thursday, and I was very sleepy, so I may have felt differently in a change of circumstances.The decor was pretty cool - they have a terrace area above the main bar/restaurant which works well and I imagine makes it so that you're never really waiting long for a table!I ordered 6 sticky BBQ wings and the corn! For someone that isn't really keen on wings I actually really enjoyed them - they were sticky, light and delicious!Now, for someone that REALLY likes corn on the cob, I didn't enjoy it that much at all, sadly. The chilli butter, although obviously expectant of it, was a lot spicer than I thought it would be and this kind of ruined it for me. If you don't like spice, no butter is a must! Overall a good experience.Note: they also have a bar downstairs which sounded pretty poppin'!",

After a long day working in London we were more than tempted by the thought of chicken, ribs and after looking at the menu chicken seasoned fries....any place adding chicken to more of the dishes than they need to can never be a bad thing in my opinion. Upon our late arrival we were happy to see that they were still serving food here. It was after 10pm but this place has more of a bar/diner feel so the decision to serve food that little bit later seems to suit it. The majority of other people in the venue were drinking at the bar and general kicking back but because of the layout of the space it didn't feel weird that we were eating. I decided to go for the quarter Nashville chicken with fries and coleslaw which was decent just not mind-blowing. The chicken was a good portion but lacked spice and seasoning and the fries were pretty average in my opinion. This is a place that suffers from a slight style over substance issue. It looks and sounds great but the food does not live up to the design and playlists for me.",

I've been continuing my search for good fried chicken in London TownJoe's recently opened another branch in Kentish Town, which triggered an alert on my foodie radar. Their menu sounded promising with tea brined fried chicken bringing a little drool to my lips. The American practice of brining their chicken beforehand helps it to stay moist while getting its crispy deep fried coatingI headed to Joe's central London location as it was closer and was given a warm welcome. On the southern American menu, my Chinese thrift gene was excited to note that another American tradition had crossed the ocean - the blue plate special. This is a good value meal marked out on the menu and as it offered fried chicken, that was perfect. I added a side order of Mac n cheese to round out my American dining experienceThe chicken was moist and the coating crispy though I had hoped for a little for zing with my crunch. Fries were competently crispy and the BBQ pulled pork beans close in flavour to baked beans. Mac n cheese was lovely and gooey on top but a little heavy towards the bottomThe homemade lemongrass lemonade tasted nice but was fizzyNice meal but The Lockhart is still my favourite American style fried chicken in town",

The bar could be a bit better attended (there are two bartenders and they struggled a bit during the night) but they know how to mix their drinks, maybe better to be slightly understaffed until they can add someone who can meet the other two guys' calibre. Drinks aren't too expensive, I think the most expensive we had was about \u00a310 but boy was it worth it. Looking forward to trying their Kentish town location",

The staff took a while to notice us given they weren't busy at all, but soon put a smile on my face with a warm welcome and let us choose our table near the front windows. My smile only got bigger when they told us it was happy hour all day on Sundays - win! I hadn't been planning to drink, but \u00a34 cocktails seemed too good to pass up so a lychee martini it was. Joe, you're a bad influence.The menu is a mix of hearty southern classics, slow-cooked meats, burgers and chicken in various forms - suffice to say it presented us with a tough choice, especially with all the delicious smells teasing us at the same time. In the end I went for the Coq (in a bun) Of The Week from the specials board - chicken thigh, bacon and monterey jack cheese with hot and spicy sesame coleslaw, which was tasty and oh so satisfying. I really liked the coating on the chicken and the slaw in particular. My date got his caveman look on with the 8 hour slow roast beef short rib with BBQ rub and more tasty slaw, which was a bit of a monster when it arrived on a chopping board but looked tender enough to fall off his fork, and obviously he managed to finish it. Fries with chicken salt on the side finished us off, so the desserts will have to wait for next time.A satisfying but food coma inducing start to a Sunday - highly recommend walking your first few tube stops home if you plan to do anything other than flop on the sofa afterwards...",

I enjoyed the 'Miami Vice' cocktail I had - Tanqueray gin, orgeat syrup and cranberry juice topped up with Prosecco in a tall glass. It was tasty and refreshing which was nice. The atmosphere wasn't bad and we got a seat straight away as it was quite early on a Saturday evening. However whilst wewere there they decided to put the music up really loud even though it was still quite early AND the bar wasn't packed. Totally the wrong time of night to be pumping up the music and it wasn't the right crowd for it either. So I found that a bit weird and it also became difficult for myself and my companions to talk to one another!",

Despite the place being busy, the waiter gave us lots of attention, was very friendly, and ensured the service was fast (but not too fast, meaning we had time to chat!).The menu had lots of choice, but all within the American theme. Chicken wings to start were delicious - packed full of flavour and dripping with sauce. Lots of them too!Mains were just as good; I had a huge burger - although you did have to order fries separately. Still, it meant that I could go half fries and half Mac and cheese with a mate which I enjoyed. One of our friends had the 'prison plate' which was interesting - pulled pork, butter beans, rice and corn bread served on a metal prison tray! Novel.Drinks were pretty reasonable to say we were in Covent Garden. For starters, mains, sides and a few drinks each it came to 30 quid, which seemed around right for such a good location.Great place to go as a group - hope to come back soon!",
