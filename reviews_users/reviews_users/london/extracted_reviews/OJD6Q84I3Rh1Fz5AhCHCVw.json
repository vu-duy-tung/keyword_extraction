There is a big dancing area where drunk people sometimes cut a rug, and lots of chairs and sofas and things for those of us who have to rest our joints. The toilets are downstairs and are horrible. The bloke's is drowned in an enthusiastic amount of piss. It stays open late, and would probably appeal most to teenagers.",

That's right, because the Rocket is so cheap and close to UCL, all the American exchange students (including myself) use it as their exclusive watering hole. The drinks here are never that great but the prices will make sure you have a good night. On the same note, the food is also deplorable but cheap. In fact, a friend of mine remarked that the Gammon Steak there look a lot like a plastic toy. All in all, The Rocket will definitely not be short of cheap fare and Americans in the future.",

Some places I still like to visit, while others I very much associate with first year. The Rocket on Euston Road is definitely one of the latter.The Rocket is a pretty rubbish Yellow Card (cheap drinks) pub on the Euston Road. The pub is loosely divided in two areas, with seating in both, and a small dancefloor and snooker tables in the back half. The decor is pretty garish, though not as bad as it once was. The clientele is a mix of alcoholics and students.I used to go quite a lot because it was near my halls and I had a crush on one of the bar maids. Essentially it's the sort of place you go if you're a first year, want to get very drunk, and maybe 'get lucky'. If that's you, you could have quite a lot of fun, otherwise avoid.",

The bartender (what a cutie) stayed to chat despite the crowd and always made sure I was satisfied. And about the crowd, one man even told the bartender to serve me first. Chivalry is alive, and drunk! There is a DJ on Thursday nights. He doesn't play the same usual mainstream crap. It's all special remixed songs by him or his friends - you'll find Passion Pitt, the xx, Florence + the Machines, etc. The owner is a lovely man; the bouncer is from NYC. And they have a slideshow of drunken customers :) It's not my goal to be up there - but maybe yours? Sunday is quiz night, I heard it's popular! 8PM!Oh and burgers after 3PM for 3-4 pounds with a drink?! Can I not stop raving about this place?",

If I was but a fresh faced, first year student, I would revel in your cheap beer, two meals for \u00a36 and your dbl Vodka Redbulls for \u00a33.90. When half your optics are Smirnoff, the others with smatterings of Apple Sourz, you know this bar is about getting lathered.I liked the screens everywhere showing music videos, the jukebox with the bartenders favourites listed above, and I even spied a few arcade games and a pool table. The food is archetypal Wetherspoons, without actually being a Wetherspoons - cheap and good.The bar itself has an old feel, which resonates strongly with the old, ragged and often times slightly senile old folk who come in. The rest of the revellers on my visit were made up of young, spotty chav boys with their hoods and caps. They mixed quite nicely with the older, fatter, chav boys who have proudly paid for every pint of their flabby beer bellies. I can say with reckless abandon that I had no wish to converse with anyone I saw in this place today and I am far from being a toff.My lunch meal of gammon steak with chips was tasty, my New York cheesecake not so. I have nothing against cheesecake, but my first bite coincided with me watching a mouse stroll confidently across the floor not 5ft away. Mmmmm, appetizing!All in all, if you want a cheap night watching sport or watching young girls get wasted, flashing their ass as they fall on the floor, all coherent thought lost in the latest bottle of Smirnoff Ice, you will find no better place than The Rocket.P.s. I have successful used free wifi here. Whether it belongs to The Rocket is a different story.",

BANNED. this mortified me. never return to the rocket???? but it was only november...what would i do for the rest of the year?!!? terrified of staying home by myself while all my friends were out drinking, i went back the following week, hoping the bouncers wouldn't remember me. of course they did. but finally, after my friends and i begged the bouncer for nearly an hour, he grudgingly agreed to let me back in. honestly, i felt like i'd won a million freaking dollars at that moment. but here's the thing - while i do miss the rocket, i dont think i could handle it anymore. \u00a0these days, i want to be in bed by 11, latest. and the thought of pounding pitchers of beer makes me want to rush straight to the gym or do a yoga session. and that downstairs girls' bathroom that was perpetually stanky and flooded? ughhhhjksldf. i would NOT be able to handle that today.so adieu, rocket. you were honestly one of the best parts of my year abroad in london.",

    "text": "Mediocre pub. Lots of university students go here so it is packed during certain weekdays. The drinks are reasonably priced but the atmosphere could be a lot nicer. Some of the staff were a bit rude, but having lived here a while it should be expected and it could definitely be a little cleaner, especially the toilets. My advice would be to work on your customer service a little. Some of the pubs I have been to have really been able to make up for other areas where they are lacking with great customer service.",

Drinks are around \u00a32 (they run promotions through the week) and you can get food for a fiver. The quality is ok, edible pub food. And now, the bad thing... Very bad thing in my opinion...The place is grimy: the carpet looks disgusting and thoroughly stained all over the place, the tables are not cleaned regularly so you will probably find a half drunk pint and the toilets... Better not to talk about them...",

    "text": "This is the kind of pub that makes you understand why people are more inclined to go to a chain like an oniells. At least there you know what you're getting and you're never disappointed. This is incidentally the first place I've ever sent food back. I've never had to cut through mash potatoe before either. We popped in here because we're forever walking past it and always meant to pop in as it looked nice. Bang on midday we try and order the veggie breakfast, but they stopped serving it at midday so apparently missed the deadline. That's ok, there's not much on the menu for me so I order a veggie burger prepared for a standard dry meal. Fifteen mins after I was informed by apathetic staff that they had no vege burger. Half way through my pint and a little unimpressed I go for the veggie sausage and mash and wait another 40 mins for the food to arrive. The most pathetic dollop of mash potato followed by a weird, very salty gravy and vege sausages that were just chewier than your normal cheap and tasteless veggie alternative. I take my knife to try out the measly specimine and determined very quickly this was not worth anything near what I paid and took it to the bar. I stood unacknowledged for a while, then as soon as I said look, it's just not nice the guy just said the the other guy 'refund *sigh*' and gave me my money back straight away. It must be common practice there. As the Mrs finished what was edible on her plate... the scampi from scampi, chips and peas I was approached and got 'want a drink'?.I declined. While it doesn't clearly advertise the fact, it is indeed a Mitchel and Butler pub.",

This was surprising to me since it was Eurocup so I thought everywhere would be a bit lively. Not so much. We walked by The Rocket that had a decent amount of people and a DJ inside. Finally!We had sooooooooooooooooo much fun here, so much that we came back again for our last night in London too. We were drinking Tetley's mostly, which I liked, and Jagerbombs haha. We freakin limboed here. Limbo. I haven't done that in foreeevverrrr. Then we did this weird dance with guys and girls, which I hated, but whatever, all in good fun. There was a Journey sing-a-long at the end of the night. Typical bar fun. If I had been home, I probably wouldn't have been too ecstatic about the limbo and things, and would probably have rolled my eyes with a \"what grade are we in again,\" type of question. But hey, when you're a tourist, you have to enjoy it to the fullest extent. It's one of the only times people actually expect you to act like fools. We definitely lived it up at The Rocket.",

    "text": "Monopoly Pub Crawl - Stop #8 - Euston Road (Light Blue)The Rocket is an easy choice for this stop as it's large, cheap, and most importantly it's located on Euston Road (we're crazy like that). As pretty much every review will tell you, it's a very popular student pub and you can easily see why. However, the Rocket does have a few surprises in store - for example, it stocks Fruli which is a sweet strawberry beer. Not the most manly of drinks, but very refreshing when you've been knocking back bitter ales and herbal jaegerbombs all day.I couldn't tell you about the food (there is no time on such crawls to order anything beyond McD's) but they do seem to have the usual pub staples. The barstaff were very friendly and happy to see my intrepid group of rambunctious crawlers - but then again when you are used to being swarmed by students, crawlers are par for the course at best.Overall, an excellent pub crawl pub, but probably not a place I'd opt to go for a night out.",
