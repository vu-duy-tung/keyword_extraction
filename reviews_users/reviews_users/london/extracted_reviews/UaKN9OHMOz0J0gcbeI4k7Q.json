    "text": "This South Ken branch opened in late 2014 and has been jam packed every time I've passed by.The menu is reassuringly short. 6 choices with quality ingredients and safe combinations. I had Pizza 4 - Gloucester Old Spot Ham (Home Cured), mozzarella, buffalo ricotta, and wild mushrooms. I am a sucker for ricotta and will try it wherever possible, and it did not disappoint. It was creamy and heart warming, as ricotta should be.Now, Franco Manca sells itself through its sourdough, but that unique taste didn't come out as strongly for me. Considering they spend a minimum 20 hours letting the dough rise, I was expecting it to be a kicker of a taste (it was good, the crust was soft, the base was thin). What blew me away though was the home cured meat. Glorious texture, glorious taste - would go back just for the meat.Glad to have so many branches around London to enjoy an inexpensive artisan pizza. But definitely do go at an odd hour or expect to wait in the new branches! I will try a tomato, mozzarella and basil next to get to the proper sourdough taste.USP: Excellent toppings.Go with: Somebody that you want to talk to as you wait in line.Price: Low: \u00a34-7 per pizza.Comparison: A simpler, cheaper, more local Pizza Pilgrims! Major win on the meat.",

(Strike 1) We Almost went to Union Jack but for some unknown reason we walked back to Franca. While we continued to wait outside for the table, a nice lady came outside and started handing out small slices of pizza. Possible because of the long wait or Bc she wanted us to get even more hungry while we waited. The four of us got seated downstairs \u00a0with another couple we did not know (strike 2) and while we hoped to eat upstairs, the taste of that small slice of pizza outside still lingered somewhere on our tongues. \u00a0We had a sampling of the red wine (both house and organic). Decided to go with Club of Queen's House wine bottle. Excellent choice. After 2 small bites, the mozzarella prosciutto and the bruschetta, our mouths started feeling really happy!!! \u00a0We could not wait for the pizzas we ordered! After getting 4 pizzas, we slowly and quietly ate the first bite. It was very difficult as the slices were not pre cut so it annoyed us a little and that almost got the 3rd strike. But after the first slice of part thereof, we went into a state of awesomeness. These pizzas were truly the best we have had in a long time. No more strikes, we hit a HOME RUN!! We only gave this place a 4 star because the prices were too cheap (50 pounds for 4 persons) and the noise too loud due to the people complaining they ate too much. We will surely come back when we visit to London again! This is my first review so enjoy it!!",

I was appalled at the quality of the service and the temperature of the pizza, which had clearly sat unattended to for awhile before it was served to me during my last visit. Worse yet, Iwas consistently ignored despite the fact I wanted to order more drinks. Why ignore customers that want to spend money? I'll be sure to let as many people in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea how Franco Manca has taken a turn for the worse. My recommendation is to think twice at least before entering this particular restaurant. Appalling. There are a lot of other quality options in the area.",

The pizza was out fast and it was soooo fresh and tasty! One of the best pizzas I've had in my life. I could actually taste the sourness of the sour dough, and the olives and artichokes were delicious. The side salad was also very flavorful. I'm a fan for sure - so happy I didn't wait for Farmacy!",

Definitely enjoy the choices of personal pizzas given, they all seemed delicious and it took a while for me to decide. I ended up picking item number three! It was basically zucchini, ricotta, basil, and no tomatoes. They had low prices for a nice big serving of your choice of pizza, so I think that's a plus, especially in London. My pizza was 6.85 or so and it filled me up proper. From what I saw, the pizzas ranged from 4-7 pounds. They also had a variety of drinks for choices if you don't want water!! I definitely recommend this place to anyone that loves pizza, they use sourdough and it's delicious. Thin, personal pizzas that can make you happy!",

I no longer live in London, but on a recent visit it was still delicious and considerably closer to places you actually want to be. As a pizza purist it is always about the margherita for me. They nail it, of course: fresh tomato sauce, just enough mozzarella to give the thing some depth, razor thin underneath and with perfectly chewy crust (that could be sold as a standalone bread in a gourmet bakery). The rest of the menu looks good, but pizza with other toppings is no longer Neapolitan pizza.The prices have remained very reasonable, especially for South Kensington.

If you haven't heard of Franca Manca you have definitely been living under a rock, a non pizza filled rock!I didn't actually know that there was an FM in South Kensington so it was a lovely surprise when looking for a cheap-ish place to eat that it popped up on my Yelp feed (it's very hard to come by anything 'cheap-ish' in South Ken). We headed over and as expected it was packed - we only had to wait around 5 minutes for a table though and the waiter continued to apologise for the wait throughout those 5 minutes which was nice. Being quite a small restaurant you are sat rather closely to other tables but not close enough to be stumbling over each other, or knocking elbows when you eat.Both Alex and I opted for the number 4 pizza with extra tomato! The number 4 is topped with ham, mushrooms, mozerella and buffalo ricotta.The food arrived quickly - like 5 minutes quick. I do LOVE Franca Manca pizzas and the ricotta on this type of pizza just makes it - mix it with your crust and it's just heaven. The only thing for me is that the dough is a bit too doughy and I usually end up leaving quite a lot but the pizza overall, with its fresh and delicious toppings, is one not to mess with and for just \u00a36.50 it is unbelievably good value for money. Just as a side note, we also had the olives. I didn't like them - way too buttery and they left a really funny taste in my mouth BUT again persona preference.",

Honestly wasn't expecting something this good in London but my sister and I stopped here per recommendation of a YouTuber (Joan Kim). This was our first meal upon landing and it hit all of the spots and then some. They're personal sized pizzas and very reasonably priced, the cheapest being $5 pounds and others ranging around $9-10. My sister opted for the tomato basil (keeping it simple)and I went for their meat special on the board that day.The crust is Neapolitan style I believe. Perfect mix of doughy and crusty; it's a bit hard to explain. The sauces never overpowered and let the flavors shine by itself. My pizza particularly had some type of cheese that blew my mind (I wish I remembered the name!) added so much flavor to it. We crushed the pizzas in a few minutes and if it weren't for us wanting to food hop, I would've gladly ordered some more.The atmosphere is nice and almost made me feel like I was in Italy. Overall felt pretty authentic and is a great place to have cheap, delicious lunch.",

    "text": "Living in Europe has made me gobble up as much Neapolitan pizza as I can, even though it's pretty much the norm here. All pizza is comfort food, whether it's a dollar slice or an artisanal pizza... or wait, European-style sourdough pizza?!San Franciscans, you owe it to yourself to hit up one of Franco Manca's locations when you're in London... if you don't have any dietary restrictions.This pizza place is a leisurely walk from the museums in the area (Science Museum, Natural History Museum, and the V&A) on a nice spring or summer day--those ten minutes will feel like forever on a cold day. We had a lot of fun checking out all of the restaurants and stores on Old Brompton Road.I immediately noticed the cool, young vibe as soon as I walked in (very warehouse chic), but rest assured that Franco Manca isn't a rude hipster restaurant. Our server seated us immediately, brought over some tap water, and answered any questions we had about the menu. Although there are two daily specials (one meat and one veggie), I felt like people who don't eat red meat get kind of shafted by the menu. I went with the day's veggie special (something with courgette, or zucchini for my fellow Yanks), and while it was tasty, I wasn't really wowed by the flavor. I also tried some of the #5--the salty anchovies practically made the pizza inedible.Our lunch didn't seem too expensive for the South Kensington area, but I couldn't help but feel that Franco Manca just wasn't the right place for me. Maybe they should offer more pizzas on their menu? But I wouldn't hesitate to give this place a shot--as long as you check out their menu beforehand.",

The menu is pretty simple and they have daily specials. I went here with a friend and we decided to each order a pizza and split it. We ordered the daily special and the number 3 pizzas. The special came with salami, mozzarella, goat curd, watercress, and tomato. The special was delicious and had the most flavor from the salami and mozzarella. The sourdough crust is amazing! It has a spongy texture to it, but also adds in some crisp from the thin crust! The number 3 pizza was tasty and the ricotta went well with the sausage. We also ordered the organic lemonade and it was so fresh! It tasted like actual lemons and was a great refresher with the pizza. The pizza here is absolutely wonderful! The dough is fresh and a new favorite way of having my pizza made!",

    "text": "Pay no mind to my 4 star review - this pizza is without a doubt the best in London. I'll explain why I've knocked 1 star off later.---~ Atmosphere:This place is constantly really busy and hectic, but the atmosphere and design of the restaurant is quite nice. Be prepared to need to sit up right close to someone else though as tables are really squashed together to maximise space.~ Customer Service:Service was friendly, but this is where the 1 star comes off. I ordered my pizza (ham hock) without mushrooms. At first glance when it came out, there were no mushrooms but upon eating it, there definitely were - just a bit hidden. I'm assuming that the mushrooms were already in the sauce or something?All of that is completely understandable - and thankfully I wasn't allergic to mushrooms it's just a personal preference (I can't stand mushrooms - I'm not a picky eater with anything else, it's just that ONE ingredient). However, they didn't know I wasn't allergic. I wouldn't have minded if the wait staff had just said \"the mushrooms are in the sauce\" or anything like that and I would've been happy to change up my order. As an example, the next day I went to Shoryu Ramen, ordered no mushrooms, and the waitress asked if it was a preference or an allergy. Very easy to do.Basically what I'm saying is, if you have some sort of allergy, I wouldn't trust this place to take care of you.~ Food:The pizza itself was amazing. I've never had such flavourful dough that I could straight up eat on its own and be happy. The pizza was great (I picked out the mushrooms and ate around them) and my partner loved his as well and claimed it was definitely the best pizza that he's ever had. I've never been fussed on pizza but I just realised that I've never had PROPER pizza before! Franco Manca definitely changed my mind.---Overall, I would definitely recommend this place. Just be wary if you do have an allergy.",
