    "text": "Cor wow you gotta love London. So many hidden gems. I don't agree with the general opinion that Finsbury Park is a hole, not no longer anyway- I've developed something of a soft spot for it over the last year. Walk West from Finsbury Park up Stroud Green road passed all the hair product shops and take a right. Enjoy looking through the windows of all the Victorian terraced houses and just like that, out of the middle of nowhere, up pops the Fullback. Weekend nights is jammed packed, I was following instructions to go find my girl who was there playing pool. First step through the door took me into a tiny horse shoe shaped bar and I assumed I must be in the wrong place where on earth would they fit a pool table?? Tardis, that's what the Fullback is. One room peels off another off another until you come out into a hall dedicated to the art of beer swilling. Garden picnic tables furnish the room with pool table to the left. Outside there is the most charming series of little terraces- they have made something out of nothing here, clearly thinking if we can't go outwards, we shall go skywards. It's just so cool. Probably my favourite pub in all on North London at the moment and what a cool name right?",

    "text": "The Faltering Fullback has won local awards and is generally considered the best pub in Finsbury Park. Where, in keeping with name, sports are shown. The inside of the pub is divided into two areas; a handsome traditional bar at the front a slightly ugly barn like area at the back with pool tables and a jukebox. Outside there is a spacious split-level decked seating area, pleasant in the summer. The charm of the Fallback is that whilst many pubs are either gritty and intimidating or contrived and aspirational, it feels organic in it's appearance and clientele, attracting a good mix of Finsbury Park community. It is the sort of place where you immediately feel comfortable.",

The place is split into three areas: Main Bar: This feels like a fairly normal pub, just a bit darker and has loads of random stuff hanging on the ceiling. A selection of tables, chairs and booths. 'Sin Bin:' This is a large-ish open room/hall with outdoor furniture inside and a TV screen which shows sport and a jukebox. Outside: This is the hidden gem of this place, which has made what was a small beer garden into one of the best beer gardens in North London, which has been built up with the use of some very well designed decking. The only bad thing about this place is that the toliets are not very nice and could do with a refresh and a clean.",

The front room is dimly lit, and really cosy, this too has been split into 2 areas and has a really warm ambience. The back room has more of a 'younger vibe', brightly lit with a funkier feel to it. Complete with quiz machine, jukebox and a pool table. The music is at the right volume and if you fancy a bit of quiet you can pop out into the beautiful hidden roof terrace. The rear of the pub is the beer garden/roof terrace which has it's own bar. there is the floor level and around it is a rooftop terrace, dimly lit and really chilled. It is in a square shape so you can walk up one side of the stairs and do a full circuit and come back down the other side and back into the back room of the pub. It also has split levels at the top and some hidden areas.",

The Fullback apparently used to just have a couple of tables in a small courtyard at the back, but come the smoking ban decided to look after the nicotine addicts and build them their own wooden refuge. The garden is on about five tiers with tables and benches all built into the walls and floors. Inside the pub isn't without its charm too - the main bar is cosy and happy, the canteen area outside the kitchen is loud and fun (particularly good when the Arsenal are playing). Staff are awesome - you can get served within seconds of walking in, even when the air is thick with people. They serve a load of lagers (didn't notice the other beer options I'm afraid - update to come) and what appear to be local wines - didn't get to try as I only caught sight on the way out - a couple named Seven Sisters drew my eye to the blackboard. Another thing to check back on. Full marks for friendliness - everyone there up for a chat and good banter. Well done, Finsbury Park, I think you've ensnared me.",

If I am indoors, I spend most of my time thinking about my next trip outside and if I am with companions, either I see very little of them or, if we go outside together, we risk losing our seat. If we are both smokers and take turns going outside, we never see one another. The Faltering Fulback is the best pub in London, in my opinion, for smokers and their companions. The garden is built on five levels, like a huge Escher building, with mad steps going up and down interlinking the various levels. The outside seating area, much of which is covered in case of poor weather, is charming, and because of added items of furniture such as bookcases, paintings and mirrors, those non-smokers who resent it when smokers insist on getting a table outside will not feel that they are missing out on the pub atmosphere, as the outdoors atmosphere in this pub is second to none. Comfortable, and at night-time buzzing with people. Sports fans can enjoy a good atmosphere also \u00a0a great place to watch major sporting events such as the World or European cup is guaranteed to bring in large crowds from the surrounding multicultural population. I couldn't recommend this amazing pub highly enough.",

It's upstairs is where the place really shines, where you are presented with several levels of mind boggling sumptuous beer garden. By garden I don't just mean an outside space, the wizards here have made a multilevel labyrinthine forest for your enjoyment with quirky little details such as japanese books and pin badges sneaking around.

I don't venture much farther than Camden, mostly because the bus routes and tube lines spread out in a beautiful graphic that means walking and occasionally getting lost. Call me naive about London, but hey, I'm still a baby in this city. When the opportunity came to catch a pint at the Faltering Fullback near Finsbury Park, I figured it was a good opportunity to step a little bit out of my knowledge zone, and I was well rewarded.It's a huge place, first of all, though you'd never know from the inauspiciously standard pub facade and quiet neighborhood location. There's many, many rooms, tons of seating at both tables and benches, and all kinds of corners to tuck into for whatever surprises the night may hold. They have a normal pub bar, featuring bottled and draught pints, but I can't speak to wine options or anything like that. I'm also unsure of food, as I was unfortunately short in my visit to the place.I'd like to come back though, as it seems like an interesting locals place. I never would have found it on my own, so I also appreciate the local friend who introduced me to The Faltering Fullback. Long live the north, I guess!",

It was painfully hot inside on the day I went, so much so that even in the time ordering a drink you'd start to sweat.Outdoors generally:The garden was really full when we first checked it out, so we decided to just sit on the street outside for the first drink. It deserves a mention only because it was a great atmosphere. The street was lined with people from the pub for about 20m and it just had a perfect vibe to it. Obviously nothing quite as fun as a street party or a festival but there's a certain pleasure that comes from drinking on the street with a load of other people that's hard to nail down.The garden:Allegedly inspired by the Ewok village, the beer garden here truly is a wonder. Somewhat small in terms of its actual per floor area, but overall, it's a three-storey multi-tiered garden and has a lot of space. Didn't quite feel like I was in Return of the Jedi but certainly did semi transport me out of London for a bit.

People wise, you get a friendly north london crowd on most days of the week, thanks to its gentrifying location. The Fullback shows the footy and the rugby but its not really a footy pub, and if thats not your bag, you can easily escape it.Definitely worth a visit.",

    "text": "It's a full house of five stars for this not-so faltering Finsbury Park public house.I think they are justified, because this is the kind of pub you will travel to visit because it has got so many things going for it. It's a big buidling, almost warren-like in its selection of rooms and outside areas. You can wander through cosy snug bars, an open barn-like room with pool tables, and along outdoor wooden decks in search of a spot to stand and sip. The outside area, which ranges across 3 levels and is decorated with bright flower tubs, is great.The thing I probably like best is the sense that stuff happens here - you won't just spend the night sat in a corner cut off from the rest of the punters. There's a real pub atmosphere, which isn't always easy to find in poserish London, with a varied clientele who seem happy to mix and mingle.On my trip, a quiet drink with a lady friend, we heard plenty of laughter, met a couple of characters, and even saw a little bit of a fight (admittedly not a selling point for most, but, hey, 'a pint and a fight is a great British night', right?). My rugby team (Hackney RFC) often end up here on a Saturday after games, so you can expect it to be fairly buzzing, and very boozy on those evenings!As a previous reviewer has said - its selection of real ales is somewhat lacking compared to other good pubs.",

I don't think the beer selection is all that stellar (though it isn't bad by any means!). There is always football or rugby on. BUT THERE IS A TREEHOUSE IN THE BACK. And the jukebox is good! And the crowd is always friendly and having a good time! And the bartender lady asked me to be useful and open a dumpster for her!It's just a great place to relax.

Alas, the Thai food isn't served until 6:30 on a Saturday, so we decided to nurse a couple of pints whilst we pondered where we would go for lunch.We sat inside the pub (by the bar), hence not seeing the garden. I really liked the quirky decor of different bits and bobs hanging from the ceiling and cuttings and clippings on the wall, but it definitely had a sports pub vibe. They had a couple of craft ales on tap and it didn't seem too expensive price-wise. I believe a couple of pints was shy of \u00a39 (which is crazy for Birmingham prices, but seems about average for London). I can't really say a lot more, as we only had a fleeting visit - but consider this review a placeholder for a much more detailed summary of the gardens and the food when we next get back!",

You'll feel like you're hidden away in a secret garden, which is conveniently a little sun trap.The inside of the pub isn't great, it's a very Arsenal pub which gets very busy, but the gardens remain lovely and tranquil.Even in the autumnal days, it's lovely as there are heaters to sit under.Drinks are the usual kind of price for London pubs. They serve delicious Thai food which is very authentic. I haven't had such a tasty Pad Thai for a while.",

    "text": "I lived in Finsbury Park for about ten years, and until 2009 I had a flat pretty much across the road from the Fullback. This was a truly great thing because the Fullback was one of the best pubs in the area, making \u00a0it super easy for lazy old me to persuade all and sundry to come to my neck of the woods for a drink. And at the end of the night, after a coupla beers and a delicious Thai, I could take a hop, skip and a jump into bed.I've since moved though and don't go there quite so often. But a few of us went for a quick drink there yesterday and I gotta say, for me, it ain't what it used to be. Why? Can't quite put my finger on it... I love the upstairs outdoor seating area, but there was no way we were ever going to find ourselves a seat up there. There was space in the downstairs outside bit, but it's pretty enclosed and so super smoky. The inside feels a bit sticky. 30% of the women's toilets were out of order, so I had to wait an age to spend a penny. And I've been told before by the staff that the veggie Thai curry contains fish sauce and they won't make it entirely vegetarian especially for you (though this may have changed since.)Maybe I'm just older and soberer than I used to be. Or maybe it's because it's not my local anymore. Or maybe it's just not as good as it used to be. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great pub, but I'm not utterly in love, not like I used to be. Perhaps one day the Fullback might win me back. Until then... meh.",

Always busy as they are heavy linked to sport, showing games and also as a social meet up after local rugby tournaments. Amazing tiered garden that again gets full very quickly. They also have a Thai Kitchen set up that serves some good tasty curries to help you wash down your drinks. (Visit - 27/05/2014)",

    "text": "I blame an early childhood obsession with ewoks as to why I love this pub so much. For summer months you really can't beat a treehouse beer garden. Even if, after a few, the stairs do start to feel a bit perilous.The inside is a bit less glam but just as good an atmosphere and I have even ventured here in the winter months and it's been a good cozy find.With a solid selection of wines and ciders, this is a happy-making pub for me. If it wasn't for the Hunger Games style fights you have to engage in for a table in the summer this place would be pretty much perfect.",
