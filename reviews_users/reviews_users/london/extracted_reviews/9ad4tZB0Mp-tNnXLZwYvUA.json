    "text": "Our first visit to this venue was one of the highlights of 2011 so far \u00a0so it had a lot to live up to! On our second visit we arrived to find a queue of people waiting to book a table. With no bookings taken over the phone/a first come first serve system, there's always the worry that someone will need to get there quickly from work to secure a table before 9pm. The staff are efficient, fair and friendly though which means it's a less stressful experience to get on that all important list than it might be with the wrong person managing the bookings. The bar was pleasantly busy, with a good rotation of space, as the lucky people (there before you) are called to their table in the main restaurant.The barmen were pretty busy which is why it meant all the more that the gentleman looking after me (I wish I'd got his name) really took some time to help me navigate the wine list. Faced with a selection of grapes that I wasn't familiar with, he allowed me to try one or two wines before settling on a delicious bottle Chianti which stayed delicious through out the next 2 bottles with dinner! We didn't have to wait too long to be seated \u00a0about 40mins and we had had some bread and butter to keep us going. The gentleman serving us was the same as before, a lovely fellow with a distinctive moustache and friendly yet professional manner. Generally this is a meat heavy meal. I'm sure they provide well for vegetarians but I have to say I didn't check, as once you start on the menu your mouth starts watering with their descriptions of choices such as Goat, mounds of beef, Steak, Leg of Lamb, chicken etc. One potential downside is that they only plan for a certain amount of dishes each night so when it's gone it's gone. On our second visit we were caught out by this and had to forfeit the lamb (which had been the best dish on our previous visit). For starters the squid was delicious and not too chewy like it can so often be. I enjoyed the lobster soup, although my partner thought is was a bit too this (you cant please everyone!) The best idea for main courses is to team up, as the portions are usually for 2 or moreyou don't need to pick your battle buddy carefully though, as you certainly wont leave hungry. For mains, the Steak/Beef was amazing. Wedges of beef that were both tasty and easy to chew. Honestly, it takes a lot for me to enjoy beef or steak, as I usually find it really chewy, even when others say it's not \u00a0I have some theory about evolution here but I'll leave that for another time! The goat was delicious \u00a0a meat that a lot of people wouldn't necessarily order but they have no idea what they're missing out on and this was perfectly cooked. My chicken was a little too fruity for me but a sneaky call for some Aioli made all the difference. By the way, The Anchor and Hope don't do sauces \u00a0I'm not sure if I agree with that or notThe aioli was definitely a winner though. To full for dessert \u00a0do they get that a lot? I'm guessing so. It's not cheap but worth the splurge occasionally with a group of friends who enjoy meat and wine!All round this is a lovely experience, as long as you can get there in good time to book a table before all the best food run out.",

    "text": "The Anchor and Hope is a gastropub on The Cut between Waterloo and Southwark underground station. I have now visited twice for dinner and a couple of times for drinks and bar snacks, and I highly recommend that you try it. The pub is split into bar and restaurant sections, both well presented in the mock aged style which is popular at present. A daily changing blackboard menu is on display in the bar, which serves a good range of drinks including excellent lagers and a couple of bitters on tap. It is lucky that the bar section is a good place to relax, as the restaurant does not take bookings so it is a first come first served affair. This is generally no problem, as the staff are very amenable to seating you and it can be quite good fun to share a large table with some randomers. My most recent visit was for a Sunday lunch, when we strolled in quite late (2:30) to be initially told that we had missed the lunchtime service of a set 3 course menu. We had gone barely a couple of steps away from the pub when the chef came running out to catch us and offer just the main course and pudding. This set the tone for the whole meal, as delightfully cooked food was accompanied by superb service. We eventually ended up with some gifts from the kitchen as starters, a main of excellent mutton and an incredible apple tart desert. A special mention really must go to the staff as the service was wonderful. The chef made repeated trips to our table to bring little extras and check we were ok. The waiting staff were attentive, relaxed and , most of all, happy. It makes such a difference when the staff are obviously enjoying themselves, and really added to the whole experience. Well done the Anchor and Hope.",

    "text": "This gastro pub is often packed with a crowd of eager hungry patrons. It gets really busy. My friends was living right next to it for a few months so i visited here often, there is no booking system, it is strictly on a first come first serve basis, and this means the bar area is packed with the hungry and ready. The food is nice, and changes with the seasons, using great English ingredients. I do feel it's slightly too expensive for a gastro pub, the cheapest on the menu is \u00a310, so for a lunch, is quite pricey for the type of establishment. As things get busy, service can become confused, but everything seems to run smoothly at quieter times.I would say if your in the area, and willing to pay and wait for your meal, to give it a go, but that's as far I would take it.",

Put simply, The Anchor and Hope produces some of the greatest food in London. But it also refuses to take reservations (I'm never quite sure why). So you, dear customer, must take a chance on whether you'll get to eat there. But if you do, you'll be amazed. This place understand pigeons and pork, charcuterie and cassoulet like no other. And they serve Bombadier. Enough said.",

    "text": "Anchor & Hope, I wanted to love you. \u00a0But sadly, my hopes were dashed.So this was what happened. \u00a0We fled the Old Vic after a particularly snooze-inducing The Tempest. \u00a0The night was getting cold and windy. \u00a0With high hopes, we rushed down the street to the buzzing warm embrace of Anchor & Hope. \u00a0The front room was already half empty, although still buzzing, when we walked in. \u00a0A waitress saw us and asked if we wanted a table. \u00a0She proceeded to grab a menu (a single sheet of printed paper), and motioned us to the nearby bar table. \u00a0She crossed out a few items on the Starters list. \u00a0\"These are out.\" \u00a0She then crossed out the whole lower half section of the Mains. \u00a0Then she said, \"These are all out. \u00a0Instead, we have...\" and started writing on the blank space at the top of the sheet. \u00a0\"Scottish Kippers, simply grilled, the only proper way to cook kippers, with a pat of butter on top.\" \u00a0\"Braised duck leg with carrots and peas.\" \u00a0She looked up at us and said, \"This is what we have. \u00a0Are you still interested?\"Walking into the dining room, the crowd was loud, and we squeezed our way to a 2-top in the corner. \u00a0It was the only empty table in the room. \u00a0After we settled in, and decided on a Verdicchio from the Marche, we looked at the scratched-out and scribbled-in menu in front of us. \u00a0In the end, we got the following: \u00a0Hereford Beef Carpaccio, Octopus in Aioli, Grilled Kipper, and Braised Duck Leg. \u00a0The carpaccio arrived. \u00a0A plate of raw, red beef, topped with a mess of rocket. \u00a0The beef were about \u00a01/2 inch thick slices, and not dressed at all. \u00a0The arugula were barely dressed with oil. \u00a0I suppose a carpaccio at an English gastropub is not the same as a carpaccio at Harry's Bar. \u00a0Not having embraced a Paleolithic diet now popular with a certain demographic, we took a few bites and were overjoyed that the octopus has arrived. \u00a0This dish had a lot of pungent garlic flavor in the aioli, but the octopus had the texture of canned cephalopod. \u00a0Trust me, i've had canned squid, i know. \u00a0We ended up using the sauce in the octopus to dress the beef. \u00a0Next came the kipper, with a wedge of lemon. \u00a0The fish was smoky and salty on the outside, but sweet and mild on the inside. \u00a0Needless to say, the fish was gone in a flash. \u00a0Lastly, the duck leg. \u00a0A perfect braise, if a tad on the salty side. \u00a0The carrot and peas only provided some mushy texture, as all I could taste was salt.Why 2 stars? \u00a0I suppose after what happened, do I need to explain further? \u00a0The story itself is certainly priceless. \u00a0Perhaps on another visit and under different circumstances, Anchor & Hope deserves another try. \u00a0But until then...",

However I'm now finding I need a fix at least once a week. It's a place where you can enjoy world class bourgeois cooking like , Cassoulet , Ox Cheek stew with Dumplings , Slow cooked Tamworth ( along with Gloucsester Old Spot the only edible pork in Britain) with sauerkraut , Lanchashire Hot Pot , great soups and decent deserts. Go in a group and share some of the dishes for 4 or 3 that come in rustic looking pipping hot Le Creuset cookware !

The menu (which changes daily) seemed a bit intimidating at first...(ox heart, lamb's neck?) but once you commit, dive in and decide to be a tad adventurous The Anchor and Hope can set you on a course for food nirvana.The staff was friendly at the tiny gastropub. There was no clear indication of how things worked here. No hostess or anything. I eventually asked the bartender about getting a table inside the adjoining dinning room, which is divided from the bar area by a curtain and he pointed and said, \"talk to David.\"After finding David we did have to wait awhile, but no complaints here as we enjoyed some beer and a yummy Dark and Stormy cocktail.When we got to our table we had already chosen our meals. I opted for a pork dish with apples and my husband settled on a leek and cheese dish. I have to say that my husband chose best. We are still talking about his snail salad. YUM!After dinner we met some lovely Brits who were actually surprised two American tourists had found this little gem.\"Yelp,\" I replied.",

    "text": "I was very excited about my visit to The Anchor and Hope as it came very recommended. So what better than a romantic meal out with the other half on Friday night. Good food and amazing company surely can't fail to satisfy?I had been warned that they didn't take reservations, and as I peered into the overflowing bar my fingers were tightly crossed for a table. And as luck would have it two seats were available immediately on a table of six with two other couples. So much for the romantic meal.The tightly packed dining room is gastropub classic with wooden tables and odd chairs and wine served in goblets (unless you buy the expensive stuff). For such a small dining area there were a lot of staff dashing around in what I'm hoping was organised chaos - although despite the numbers it was hard at times to grab someones attention.As per usual I was taking sneaky peeks at other people's tables and food probably very rude, but who cares. The menu isn't hugely varied, lots of meat and fish, but all the portions looked very healthy indeed.So to the food.Starters were a Radicchio and Saffron Risotto and Pigs Head Vinaigrette. Pigs head I hear you cry. Well not a whole one. It was really just brawn. Served at room temperature the fat was tepid and unappetising. The risotto was more of an oily rice, not the creamy indulgence I was expecting. It was certainly stuffed with saffron though.Mains were several notches up. Both the Half Lobster and Corn on the Cob and the Baked Wild Sea Trout with Beetroot and Samphire were glittering combinations of taste and colour. The sweet succulent lobster meat performing a little tango with the most amazing corn I've had for a long time - crunchy and sweet - all moulded together with melted butter. The cold sea trout dish produced a perfectly cooked fish with the tingling surprise of pickled cucumber and sweet beetroot.But the hit of the evening had to be the dessert. Strawberry Tart. But not just any strawberry tart. The Strawberry Tart. Buttery melt in your mouth pastry encasing a moist hazelnut filling topped with juicy strawberries. You'll be pleased to know that I did share with my other half, but only a couple of fork-fulls and only because his cheese platter really wasn't up to much.At \u00a385 for two including a bottle of wine I found it a bit steep. This is certainly a restaurant to come as a group with excellent deals like a whole roast seabass or rib of beef for two or a seven hour lamb shoulder to share with 4 of your closest friends. Food 3.5/5 - The Strawberry Tart gave the edgeService 3/5 - A bit slow but very cheeryEnvironment 3/5 - Typical gastropub just small and tight.",

    "text": "I always find myself wanting to rate with a half star and this is another time. \u00a0I think The Anchor and Hope is a solid 4.5. \u00a0Last Friday, after a gruelling workout, six people from the gym went out \u00a0to launch a birthday celebration. \u00a0After two hours of real ale, we all realized that if we didn't get some food immediately there would be serious problems. \u00a0 Someone in the group suggested The Anchor and Hope so we walked there with purpose. \u00a0We saw a line of people waiting for tables when we entered at 10:25 and found out the kitchen closes at 10:30 so we figured it was a lost cause. \u00a0I asked one of the waiters if there was any chance of a table and he told me he would check and see. \u00a0I didn't see his face for five minutes and we were afraid the answer would be \"no,\" so we left to find nourishment. \u00a0After going about half a block, we heard the man from The Anchor and Hope calling us back into the restaurant. \u00a0It was unexpected and extremely appreciated. \u00a0The man took our orders before we were seated so he could get them into the kitchen as soon as possible. \u00a0I looked at the chalk board menu (most things were crossed off because they cook fresh daily) and nothing really caught my eye, but I was told one of the replacement dishes was lasagne for two and my husband and I ordered it immediately. \u00a0The starters came out shortly after we were seated. \u00a0I shared a snail and bacon salad. \u00a0There were large portions of each on a bed of warm \u00a0lettuce. \u00a0Someone ordered the soup and managed to say the broth tasted homemade in between rapid slurps. \u00a0 Oak smoked salmon was also ordered and devoured quickly. \u00a0The lasagne was served in a large oval \u00a0cast iron dish and we found it to be a delicious cheesy, meaty mess. \u00a0It filled my husband and I completely and there was still enough to give a scoop or two to others at the table. \u00a0The noodles were outnumbered by the cheese and beef and if it was served with tortilla chips it would have made a nice dip. \u00a0Pure decadence. \u00a0Dishes like this are why I go to the gym. \u00a0Three people ordered the rabbit. \u00a0Its portion size was also big and we saw a few people in the restaurant with little tinfoil purses taking food home so that seemed to be par for the course. \u00a0I found the meat a little dry and salty, but my friends finished their meals. \u00a0Another person ordered the duck and said it was the best she had ever had. \u00a0It was falling off the bone moist without the fattiness you sometimes experience with duck. \u00a0We each ordered dessert and those dishes were also licked clean. \u00a0I enjoyed a little chocolate pot with cream on top. \u00a0The liquid topping, hard outer shell and moist dark chocolate inside provided three nice textures. \u00a0The buttermilk pudding with rhubarb and spiced oranges was just okay. \u00a0It was akin to a bland flan and could have used more rhubarb. \u00a0The person next to me made quick work of the little lemon pot. \u00a0It was a great meal with fantastic service. \u00a0I definitely recommend The Anchor and Hope.",

    "text": "So, faced with an evening doing my tax return, I decided the best way to warm up was to sit in a pub with a cocktail and my book for an hour before wheeling home to grapple with a bag of receipts and several utterly incomprehensible access codes. The Anchor and Hope has fantastic cocktails. On the rare occasions I've managed to squeeze in before, a friend and I have hunkered at the bar and got stuck into the cheap, small measures. They do Sidecars, which is fantastic. In fact, the whole menu is pleasantly old school \u00a0Americans, Negronis, Dark and Stormys, and so on. The major problem with the A&H is, ironically, how good it is. I've wanted to eat at The Anchor and Hope for ages. Seeing as I live a tramp's stumble from its front door, this shouldn't have been hard, but every time I've passed it it's been rammed. You have to mentally prepare yourself to go there as it's rarely filled at anything less than scrum capcity. There are a couple of tables where you can hide away from other people's elbows, bags and knees, but it's not a tremendously great place to unwind. I decided the tax return needed to be put off for at least another cocktail's worth, so called up the boyfriend and asked if he'd like a break from crap weather and work and to come to dinner. After waiting an hour or so for a table, we were slotted on to the end of another table which was a bit of a surprise. Some people like this, I really don't unless you're at Wagamamas. But hey-ho. A waitress immediately got us some bread (two slices, delicious. I accidentally ate most of it much to the amused disapproval of my boyfriend). I had the starter of duck's heart and radicchio risotto as my main course, boyfriend had the hare. I've never had hare before and am kicking myself: unctuous, impossibly dark meat that melted in the mouth with a wistful Animals of Farthing Wood aftertaste. The risotto was a good risotto, the duck's heart could have been a mushroom. Not much more to say about that really. Boyfriend had pecan pie and ice cream (I wrestled a pecan from it, pretty good) and I had a scoop of salted chocolate ice cream. Ordinarily I'm not keen on chocolate ice cream but love the sweet/salt mix. This could have done with a smidgeon more salt to make it proper orgasm on a plate, but was still nice enough. The staff are impeccable. They must have some secret genome that lends them good looks, saint-like patience, manners and good waiting ability despite working in the SE1 equivalent of London Zoo. I was utterly mortified last night to pay the bill by card, ignoring the service charge as always, and then reaching into my purse to find out I didn't have any change. Next time I pass, I'll throw in some pound coins and hope they hit their mark, because as decent as the food and drink is, the Anchor and Hope is too stressful to bother with again. As it is, it really doesn't need another fan, it's already well over capacity.",

    "text": "Had been looking forward to going to The Anchor & Hope for a while. Went for a late lunch in the hope that we would be able to get a table reasonably quickly. We got a table immediately. Service began well and then deteriorated but I think that was because the service was coming to an end. Really liked the menu overall, although the special of steak pie didn't sound that special to me. They close the kitchen at 2.30PM and we were lucky enough to get our order in at about 2.25pm. The meals came quickly and were delicious. I opted for the potato and gubbeen pie which was hearty and delicious. Serving sizes are huge here which is something I appreciate because it means I can fit dessert. Once we got our mains the service was really patchy. We had to remind the waitress about our drink orders as well as reminding her that we would like to have dessert. The desserts were delicious, I had the trifle. Not impressed that they don't do decaf coffee as one of our party cannot drink caf coffee. Overall, will definitely go back as the food was extremely well prepared and delicious, but I agree with other comments that they need to work on their service.",

    "text": "Beware, for this is not a typical gastro-pub. This is certainly not a quick eat-and-go place. Anchor & Hope is strictly for those who treasure a good gastronomic experience and are willing to slug it out for one. Although, it would be unfair to say that the possibly long wait for a table in this wee pub is equivalent of slugging it out. They have no cider on tap, but they had bottles of fine Devon cider to keep me suitably occupied. The bar area, on a Tuesday night, was choc-a-bloc with wooden stools, round tables and a whole lot of people - some might consider this annoying and noisy but I found it a fabulous exercise in people watching while catching up with a fellow foodie friend. We were eventually seated on a 6-seater with two of us on one end and a couple on the far end of the same table - we weren't terribly fussed, really. A few minutes later, after we had placed an order for the house wine and starters, the waitress came bustling towards us and apologised while asking us if we would mind moving to a 2-seater table next to us because they needed the table for a big group. We didn't mind it at all, but they said the wine would be on the house for the inconvenience - so big props on the service :)The house red was nice and so was the starter (I'm struggling to remember what this was, it was over a year ago, but I remember being well pleased with it) but what really clinched it for me would be the tenderly cooked duck in a sweet date sauce - indeed, a well made meal can be a joyful memory for a long time to come! My friend ordered a chicken which she found very delightful too. This was followed up with some brilliant chocolate mousse and at no point did we feel like we were being rushed through our email, despite the inevitable flurry of service staff dashing between tables.While not cheap, it is fairly inexpensive for a place that ranks consistently highly in gastro-pub ratings.I wonder why I haven't been to A&H since that wonderful meal, this review reminds me that I need to make a trek to the Cut soon!",

But enough of my homespun wisdom, let's just stick to the Anchor and Hope.I like the dim lighting, makes everyone look more attractive. And the drink selection is great. The food was really yummy but not as amazing as I had hoped. I think this is because I went really late and had the one main that was still available. So there's your lesson. Go late and you have a better chance of getting in without a wait, but go early and you get a better dinner. Go forth and get gastroed out of it.",

Some of my lunch companions mentioned this place, but in the same breath also said, \"Oh, we're probably not going to get in, it's always rammed.\" \u00a0But we decided to take a chance and in we walked to a table for five. From the off, it's worth saying that the menu is not your traditional gastropub menu. It apparently changes on a weekly basis and when we went, the menu was full of offal and game - think pig's head and duck hearts. \u00a0I'm not really one for these more hard-core cuts of meat, so I opted for the semolina gnocchi with chicory leaves and St. Teo goat's cheese. I know now that I don't like chicory, but the gnocchi and goat's cheese were just sublime. This wasn't traditional gnocchi though. It came in two very flat rectangles with quite a lot of St. Teo's on top. Really delicious and well balanced. What a great place. I can imagine a lot of boozy lunches here in the future.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to eat here for a while. A previous attempt with some friends from out of town was abandoned since we weren't \u00a0patient enough to stand \u00a0with a bunch other people pushed into the corner of the pub on the off chance we might actually secure a table. They don't take bookings.This time we had an excuse to go early before the theatre so checked in at 5:30 and got on the list for a 6pm table which is when the evening session starts. At 6pm, the lucky groups, including us, filtered into the dining area which is separated off from the pub area.The dining interior is fairly cramped with wooden tables and chairs, similar to the pub area.Menu looked good. British classics with one or two continental offerings thrown in (andouillette sausage for example). Sustaining meat and fish dishes and hearty puddings. I like this simple kind of no frills food.I had the potato soup with crisp bacon as a starter. Food came quite quickly as the kitchen swung into full steam ahead and suitably rustic bread was brought along with water (no attempt to upcharge for bottled which is good). The soup was OK but reminded me of thinned down mashed potato and the bacon wasn't crisp but more like slightly dried out ham. I know it's a simple dish but I have had potato soup that has been quite memorable. I do like the idea of very simple dishes that can be made special.For mains I had the middle white pork with prunes and mashed potato. The dish was perfectly acceptable and well executed but nothing special to note. My dining companions had the lemon sole which was reported to also be quite good but not too exciting.Some decent and reasonably priced wine selections, with wine served in a tumbler, utilitarian style to match the rest of the concept.Since the portion sizes weren't huge despite the heavy sounding descriptions, we had room for desert so opted for a date or fig (can't remember exactly) pudding with whiskey sauce and clotted cream. I was expecting a warm, melt in the mouth steamed pudding. What came was a wodge of slightly heavy and slightly dry \u00a0loaf cake served cold, slightly dry with some dcent whiskey flavoured sauce and dollop of clotted cream. Again, OK but not as good as I was anticipating. Should have had the Queen of Puddings instead perhaps.Service was efficient \u00a0and prompt.Overall A-OK sums it up well for me taking into account the food and value for money. With the price tag approaching \u00a340 a head I have eaten better at other gastro pub or restaurants serving similar themed British food. Good enough but wouldn't rush back. It's puzzling since the place has such a reputation as one of the best gastro pubs. Maybe a victim of it's own success since there is a queue out of the door or maybe other places have just got much better or perhaps just wasn't the best night here since others rate it more highly.",

    "text": "We stopped in here on a recent trip as it seemed highly recommended on various online forums. We got there at 6 and it was packed, which was a good sign. But it was pretty chaotic and no clear way to get a name down for a table or any such thing. We squeezed our way to the bar and got drinks and inquired about getting a table. The bartender sort of blew it off, telling us to find a \"slender red-haired girl\" to ask. Okay. I thought I spotted the person he may have been referring to, so I headed over her way, and as I rounded a corner, I became a momentary road block for a server coming through and he was not at all pleased. He asked if I needed a table and I said yes, to which he said to wait around the corner and he'd send the hostess over to us. Okay, that sounded good, despite the fact that he seemed clearly agitated with my mere presence in the building. Skeptical, I watched him closely and it became clear after 5 minutes or so that he had no intention of alerting any hostess. We gave it one last try, flagging down the possible red-headed hostess and were successful on our third try! We actually got a table pretty soon after that, after hanging in the bar area for 10-15 minutes. Long enough to see a couple people get served a delicious looking slice of porchetta that made me drool. By the time we sat, I knew I needed it. My husband ordered a couple appetizers for his meal - bacon-wrapped snails and pig's head. He liked everything very much. My porchetta, however, looked completely different from the slices even one table over from ours. Where the plates I saw earlier were pale, juicy looking, and about an inch thick, mine was pink and jagged - thick on one side and thin on the other. It wouldn't have mattered if it tasted good, but it didn't. It was pretty much inedible. I didn't bother trying to do anything about it given my already less than welcomed feeling. Oh well.. my sense was that it's overhyped. But the crowds definitely implied otherwise. Wish we had a better experience.",

    "text": "Our first visit to this venue was one of the highlights of my summer so far - so it had a lot to live up to!On our second visit we arrived to find a queue of people waiting to book a table. With no bookings taken over the phone/a first come first serve system, there's always the worry that someone will need to get there quickly from work to secure a table before 9pm. The staff are efficient, fair and friendly though which means it's a less stressful experience to get on that all important list than it might be with the wrong person managing the bookings.The bar was pleasantly busy, with a good rotation of space, as the lucky people (there before you) are called to their table in the main restaurant.The barmen were pretty busy which is why it meant all the more that the gentleman looking after me (I wish I'd got his name) really took some time to help me navigate the wine list. Faced with a selection of grapes that I wasn't familiar with, he allowed me to try one or two wines before settling on a delicious bottle Chianti which stayed delicious through out the next 2 bottles with dinner!We didn't have to wait too long to be seated - about 40mins and we had had some bread and butter to keep us going. The gentleman serving us was the same as before, a lovely fellow with a distinctive moustache and friendly yet professional manner. Generally this is a meat heavy meal. I'm sure they provide well for vegetarians but I have to say I didn't check, as once you start on the menu your mouth starts watering with their descriptions of choices such as Goat, mounds of beef, Steak, Leg of Lamb, chicken etc. One potential downside is that they only plan for a certain amount of dishes each night so when it's gone it's gone. On our second visit we were caught out by this and had to forfeit the lamb (which had been the best dish on our previous visit).For starters the squid was delicious and not too chewy like it can so often be. I enjoyed the lobster soup, although my partner thought is was a bit too this (you cant please everyone!)The best idea for main courses is to team up, as the portions are usually for 2 or more...you don't need to pick your battle buddy carefully though, as you certainly wont leave hungry.For mains, the Steak/Beef was amazing. Wedges of beef that were both tasty and easy to chew. Honestly, it takes a lot for me to enjoy beef or steak, as I usually find it really chewy, even when others say it's not - I have some theory about evolution here but I'll leave that for another time!The goat was delicious - a meat that a lot of people wouldn't necessarily order but they have no idea what they're missing out on and this was perfectly cooked.My chicken was a little too fruity for me but a sneaky call for some Aioli made all the difference. By the way, The Anchor and Hope don't do sauces - I'm not sure if I agree with that or not...The aioli was definitely a winner though.To full for dessert - do they get that a lot? I'm guessing so.It's not cheap but worth the splurge occasionally with a group of friends who enjoy meat and wine!All round this is a lovely experience, as long as you can get there in good time to book a table before all the best food run out.",

    "text": "Having lived in Waterloo for a year and spent much of my time in the area, invariably I had Anchor and Hope recommended to me, both by word of mouth and seeing it vaunted in Time Out et al as being a must-visit gem.Laziness and lack of persistence, alas, when taken in concert with it being borderline impossible to get a table without an hour+ wait (and they don't take reservations), meant that I never got to try it.Thankfully, having started working around the corner, I'd made this place number one priority on my list. A smarter man would have angled for lunch, but I was determined to get in there with some of my more foodie friends in the evening. Fate, it seems, was smiling on me on my second attempt - miraculously there was a table the exact size I needed, which was the only one available. So it was, after such torturous travails, FINALLY we were there, seated, and soon to be wowed.Firstly - I've heard various complaints about gruff service. As per usual, it's probably completely overstated, or they had one troublesome server who's since been booted. I figure that you get out what you put in - treat staff politely and cheerfully and they'll reciprocate. Act like a prize a***-hole and don't expect high levels of service. My experience was fine - sufficiently attentive, polite and helpful, I couldn't really ask for much more given the type of establishment.The food sounded absolutely sublime, so much so that we were struggling what to choose. We had settled on sharing asparagus, scallops and \"duck ham\" followed by a mixture of Middle White pork and breast of lamb (wonderful to see this cut starting to make its way on to menus), until eyes lit up when daily specials were read out - not only was there rabbit offal (liver, kidney and lungs) to tempt us away, but a monstrous 4-5 person shoulder of veal. Needless to say, this overtook everything else and we settled on scrapping starters and diving straight in to a whole joint of baby cow. On the veal issue - given its hue after being cooked, I presumed this was rose veal. If so, a commendable sourcing decision.It came in a huge casserole dish with root vegetables and a wonderful accompanying stock. Meat was so perfectly done it simply fell off the bone (though being furnished with tongs, sharp knife, carving fork and a large spoon meant there was the opportunity for plenty of ceremony too!) and was still a delightful soft pink on the inside. Superb quality meat, expertly executed in a very simple manner - what more could you ask for.We washed all of this down with a delightful (and fairly priced) Corbieres, though the rest of the wine list looked reasonable too.In truth, it is early days to be able to judge the Anchor & Hope after only one visit. Or at least that's what I keep telling myself. Clearly, for the sake of taking one for the Yelp team and providing only the most well-informed reviews, I will have to endure this experience again. Woe is me.",

Just brilliant.The pub is on The Cut within spitting distance of Waterloo Station and is separated into two distinct halves - one restaurant, one bar. That said, you can eat in the bar too. The kitchen is totally open, giving a great atmosphere and a host of smells.They don't take reservations, so it's a case of turn up and get a drink while a table becomes available. They'll put your name down for a table in the restaurant if you want, but we managed to poach a big table in the bar early on. The furniture is old and mismatched. While this might be trendy and stylish, the choice of chairs we had was verging on treacherous as we wobbled and balanced our way through our meal.The menu seems to change on a daily basis (given by the date at the top of the A4 inkjet printed menu). We plumped for the seven hour roasted shoulder of lamb, shared between three. Furnished with a huge carving knife and plates, we quickly munched through what seemed to be half a sheep. It was tender and delicious. It was \u00a347 for three people, including a generous helping of potatoes dauphinoise.Drinks were very reasonable, with a decent selection of beers and cocktails.

Tables are communal but we got a small table to ourselves which was nicer (although it was a table you'd normally expect for two when there were three of us so it was a bit of a squeeze). The staff were friendly and attentive and it's great that they have a different menu each day so you get really fresh and seasonable ingredients. If you like fish and meat, this is a great place for you! Lots of game and whole fish. \u00a0I'm a bit of a fussy eater so I was quite limited on the menu but my friend and boyfriend I was with had plenty to choose from. \u00a0If you want a special, get it ordered quickly as I was gutted when the steak had sold out, although I had roast beef which I did enjoy - it was really rare and tender and there was a lot of it.The food was great, but we weren't wowed by it and it was quite pricey, especially for what we had.i probably won't go there again, but I can see why it is popular.",

    "text": "Let's say for example that you've never had anchovies and have no idea what it tastes like. You walk into a restaurant that specializes in anchovies and you try it and realize, wow, I really hate anchovies...how do you review this restaurant?I had picked up a London 2011 pamphlet when I first arrived here and Anchor and Hope was on the list of restaurants to eat. The place is ridiculously close to my work so one day for lunch, I suggested we go there. Someone in the group had gone there before and said it was a decent choice so off we went.We sat down, took out the lunch menu, and the Canadian in me was so confused. \u00a0I couldnt understand half of the menu and had to ask ppl at our table what they were. The things I did understood included ox heart, rabbit, wood pidgeon, sheep liver pate, and salad. Most of the entrees were at the price of 14 quid.Since it was lunch and I wasn't that hungry or adventurous, I thought the safest thing was to order \"crab on toast\" (6 pounds) and a side salad (3 pounds). What I got was half a slice of toast with this crab innard tasting pile of goo on top. Two people beside me ordered a grilled kipper, and the wood pidgeon, which looked alright. What was the WORST, however, was their service. Two people in our group ordered salmon salad and one person in the group ordered wild salmon entree. What came instead were three wild salmon entrees. The two people who ordered salad was a bit confused and said they got salad. The server didnt look happy, went back to talk to the person who took our order, who came and claimed it was his mistake and he said if we didnt eat the salmon he'd have to throw it out and that he'd take the salad off of the bill. We kept the salmon and when the bill came, we were charged for all three entree, each of which were TEN QUID MORE than the salad. Perhaps I don't understand what is called \"rustic british food\" but I'm definitely not coming back here.",

The downside to this is that menu items do run out. \u00a0I had been thinking about the fresh made ice creams the entire evening only to find out they had run out when it was time to order puddings.The quality of the food is somewhat brought down by the kinda crummy service. \u00a0At multiple points in the evening, we were greeted with surliness. \u00a0Definitely not my favorite emotion in the world of service. \u00a0At one point we were told we were taking too long to order and that there were people waiting at the door. \u00a0I mentioned above the chiding I got for wanting mayo when there was already aioli on my plate... \u00a0Just odd little service related things like that which really got under a lot of our skin.Eh, it was a good experience for the food! \u00a0Give it a go... maybe you'll have a better service related experience!",

To me, gastropubs in the States are more serious about the balance between drinks and the food, but after all they are pubs aren't they? \u00a0The world is offering tons of interesting beers, and in my opinion Britain is mostly unaware, despite being a beer drinking culture. \u00a0This was a cool, neighborhood spot, casual and serious at the same time and is a nice break from traditional pubs and chain restaurants.",

    "text": "Quite a few people have commented about the long wait at this gastropub, but realistically, if you're reading the reviews before going to this restaurant, you should know what you're in for! Get there early if you can and prepare to wait a while. You can get a bottle of wine and have some good conversation before taking the bottle to your seat -- even though the place fills in, the wait generally isn't as long as one would assume. Although I have arrived later and was still seated without too much hassle/wait, you will also benefit from arriving early because their menu changes daily, meaning it's fresh, but they will also run out of their most scrumptious items!Once you do sit down, do some exercises to expand your stomach and prepare for a feast of meat or fish. They do also have vegetarian options which are generally great, but this place excels in its huge portions of impeccably cooked meats, ranging from lamb to wood pigeons. You will not leave hungry! If you're with a larger group, the 3-person lamb shoulder is phenomenal, if it's on the menu that day. I have also sampled quite a few of their fish choices, and I have never been disappointed. Highly recommend this spot for people with some time on their hands and in the mood for a huge amount of delicious 'modern European' food in a gastropub setting!",

You'll struggle to relate their menu to typical pub fayre, and you might even need to ask for a translation (or use your iphone) for some of their offerings. I liked the open kitchen arrangement - you can see for yourself the care going into putting your meal together. It was surprisingly quick too, given it was full.The menu does change daily, but if they have the pork on the list; do yourself a favour. It was delicious. I was heartily jealous of the couple next to me sharing the cassoulet - smelt and looked amazing.Can't say I'll be back in a hurry, as I feel like I've got the t-shirt now, but I'll not grumble if someone invites me there for dinner.",

In brief: The dining room is completed separated from the bar area. You have to go to the back of the bar and around the corner towards the bathrooms to see the dining room. I could not find a separate door for the dining room so am uncertain if one even exists. The Host/Hostess should be back there somewhere. Read on for my complete disgruntled story.I was seriously confused by this place. I stopped by here after reading reviews hoping my bf and I could just grab a corner or table or something. It was pretty crowded but there were some space on the patio benches outside. Pretty good sign I'd say. I go in, and I can't find a host/hostess. I look around to see what others are doing and they are all going up to the bar. No official line, as most bars, so I squeeze in between some people and wait to get the bartender's attention. After 5 minutes he asks what he can get me so I ask if there's a menu. He asks if I mean a drink or food menu. I ask for both and then clarifies for me that they have a dining room down the hall way and around the corner (where I couldn't really see past). Embarrassed, I apologize for not realizing it and ask if I would still be able to get food at the bar as well. He said he would check. Disappeared for about 5 minute, comes back and says the guy would be over to take my order. We wait some more... Another guy asks what he can get me, I tell him I wanted to order some food, and he points at the first guy I talked to and tells me to give him my order and walks away. Well I wasn't going to try the same guy again so I give up. But the BF keeps trying! (yay)Once we figured out where the dining room was we head back that way down the narrow and cramped hallway. We see a waiter and ask if we can get a table. He points out the host (way in the back) and wait for him to come back toward the entry way. When he finally does we ask how long the wait is and he says at least an hour. So we ask can we get food at the bar too? He answered ask the bartender (and describes the same guy I talked to the first time). We give up hope and leave.",

The octopus was tender and my friend loved this but I found it a bit bland. It just lacked any bold flavours.  The crab broth with cheese toasts also lacked depth. \u00a0The broth tasted of crab but also had another flavour that I couldn't place which gave it a slightly odd taste - nothing horrible but it just detracted from the crab. \u00a0And the broth wasn't hot enough to melt the cheese into a gooey melty stringy mess. \u00a0This dish didn't work for me.  The purple sprouting broccoli wasn't purple and was slightly overcooked. \u00a0However, I loved the pairing of the anchovy sauce and the toasted almonds.  To be honest, a lot of this could have been circumvented with better presentation. \u00a0Everything looked slopped on the plate and reminded me of what you might get at someone's house for dinner, on a weeknight when they did't have time to prepare. \u00a0It also came out much too quickly, giving the impression that much of it was not made to order, and the staff weren't good about re-arranging things or taking things away to free up space.  Overall, a decent meal. \u00a0But the food was slightly disappointing.",

Went there by myself on a Friday night layover in London (this ID girl sure does get around!) and when I walked in at 8:30 was told the wait was about an hour. But they have communal seating at tables, so luck would have it there was a space at a table with a party of 2 woman and another 3 ladies. Initially I ordered the pork shoulder, but they had just run out. But the mallard was recommended. I had overlooked it somehow on the menu. Perhaps because it was labeled mallard and not duck. But I ordered it and was delighted. Place is \u00a0noisy but that's just because it attracts quite a crowd. Anyway, I recommend this place.",

Went with groups and without and while you do need to reserve if more than 4, you can find some tables for 2 easily if you are ready to wait. Simple, yet very nice cuisine. Always went on weekends, and all times were great. Lamb, Duck, Mozza, Chocolate deserts, Great ales, Steak, infused Gin (SO GOOD), etc. All times we picked good dishes out of the list and we tried a lot of different things over the few times we have been, making me think all are good, and can equally satisfy you the same way. Plus this location feels less touristy than other places we have been across the city. Staff is friendly, place is a bit noisy but brings a nice warm feeling. After digging a little we fond out they have a sister location in Soho and one on the South bank I will review as well.",

Then my friend, who is an expert on good places to eat, suggested it for gossip and food. It was a little hesitant but trust her judgement more than my hesitation so we ended up there. They do not have a good selection on non alcoholic drinks, but I'm used to pubs not having a good selection.When we were ready to eat we walked through a screen that I hadn't seen when I arrived. There behind the screen were a mixture of tables and chairs creating a restaurant. It was then revealed to me that The Anchor and Hope was one of the oldest traditional gastro pub in London. \u00a0We ordered food, slightly expensive for what we got but it did taste nice. The menu, I was informed, is always changing as they use locally sourced food. This sourcing of food is why the food was more expensive than other places. So I was happy to pay the slightly higher price. Well worth it.",

My husband ordered the lamb shoulder which was fork tender and delicious. Our friends shared the rabbit for two. They throughly enjoyed it!! I ordered the wrong thing.

    "text": "We arrived ten minutes after opening time on a blustery, wet Valentines's Day. We wanted to leave it to chance and find some place spontaneous that doesn't take reservations since we were walking around the city all day being Tourists. The Anchor and Hope could not have been a better place (with a few exceptions).We didn't know that all the tables are communal. If my boyfriend had known, he would have vetoed the choice from the getgo. The look on his face when he saw the three other people at the table in various stages of eating/ordering and waiting for dates, was priceless. But we were completely soaked from the weather and happy to sit down and warm up. We ordered a bottle of Rioja, the octopus, foie gras and the pheasant pie. One of the people across from us suggested the pie and so did the server. It may not have been my number one choice for a v-day dinner, but we needed two people to share it, and I'm always game for pheasant. (Ooh... Sorry... That was really bad, wasn't it?) order it, we did!The wine was light and crisp and the foie gras was great. The octopus was nice, but I wouldn't order it again-- I found the pieces a but too small and lost in the creme fraiche sauce that bled down beneath and made the rest if the dish suitable for nothing more than sopping up with bread. (The bread was wonderful btw.)Communal table became more fun one everyone was acquainted. Londoners are so friendly and polite! I saw the braised Lamb Neck go by and had a severe case of food envy as I watched them tear the soft tender meat from the bone like the beastly carnivores they were!!! It's worthy to note that although the Anchor and Hope is heavy in the game and meat, they did have some nice vegetarian options like the Tagliatelle with Hedgehog Mushrooms, butternut Squash and ricotta.Our Pheasant Pie arrived and it was massive!!! A golden crust, huddling carrots, mushrooms and tender pheasant. There were quite a few bones in this pie, which was a but if a turn off for me. While I understand that's what pheasant is like, I swallowed a couple and prayed the whole time that they made it down ok.Then we had a little lemon pot with cassis. And while it was, indeed-- little. It was pure perfection and about all that we would have been able to eat, anyway.Now, after such a charming evening... Why only three stars? Well, my boyfriend and I were both really sick for the rest of the night. We made our way straight back to the hotel, but instead if V-day lovin' we were both gripped with cramps and nausea for the remainder of the evening. I never quick to blame the food I've eaten, but we both shared the same things and were both very uncomfortable after that for a good long while into the night. We thought that maybe the Pheasant was just hard for us both to digest???Anyway, whether it was the fault of the pie or not, we are both left with some good and some awful memories from last night. I would still recommend this place, but the food itself was just ok. The service and ambiance made it more if an experience for us.",

    "text": "Came here with a few friends on a Monday evening, and it was still very busy! The pub is divided in two, with a dining room and then a pub area where you can also have food, and there are a few outdoor tables as well (but no standing room outside, really). The pub area is kinda odd, with an assortment of tables of different heights and types... one was high with stools and had an annoying pole in the middle, whereas the next one over was low to the ground. My friend and I sat at the bar for a while, but there was also a big pillar in the middle of the bar. Eventually we snagged an outdoor table where we waited for our two other friends, a decent spot even though there were a few passers-by that approached us to ask for money, which was a bit uncomfortable. It also rained for a little bit while we were eating, and the awning has a few holes, but we just about managed!As for the food, the menu changes daily so unfortunately the exact name/description escapes me, but I had a venison dish (round cutlets of them served with vegetables) and it was great. I'd say they only have about 5 main courses to choose from if you're not sharing, so it's probably advisable to check the day-of to make sure there is something to your liking. My friend ordered the sole and they served the whole fish, bones and all, and also suggested potatoes as an extra side dish as it came served with almonds and swiss chard... I thought that was a bit unusual, for sure. But the service was good, and luckily I ordered a pretty tasty meal, so overall I'd say that Anchor & Hope is a solid pub, a little quirky, but I'm not sure what has cultivated its reputation as one of the top pubs in London (as there is pretty fierce competition).",

    "text": "I find it quite common that English pubs are usually named by putting two of these following words together: Angel, Anchor, Arms, Castle, Crown, Elephant, Hope, etc. \u00a0So when I saw the sign \"Anchor & Hope,\" I assumed it is a pub. Situated close to the Young Vic Theatre, we went to A&H after a show, looking forward to some standard pub grub.We were quite confused when we saw the menu. Where are the pies, burgers, and fish-and-chips? It turns out it is a gastropub, so instead of the burgers and fish-and-chips, we have rump of beef, Spanish ham, pigeons, etc. Since it was late, we decided to stay and give A&H a try.I, being a non-adventurous meat eater, opted for the pappardelle with asparagus and fresh ricotta for \u00a316, which was more expensive than some of the meat dishes. I thought there must be something special with this pasta dish. I was underwhelmed. The assumingly homemade pappardelle looked homemade: irregularly sized, clumpy, and some of the noodle had holes in the middle. If the food tasted good, then I would have overlooked it. But it was super greasy (oil and ricotta), and for what I got, it was overpriced.I'm not the only disappointed diner. The worst dish for us was the roast rump of Longhorn beef with horseradish, dripping potatoes (cooked in beef fat), and rucola. We were served a HUGE rump of bloody raw beef that was soooo chewy that we had a hard time cutting the meat. After a while, I even got nauseous watching the beef being sawed and yanked and ripped apart, blech! We had to complain to the server about how inedible the beef was, and nicely (and appropriately) enough, the server took the beef off our tab. (Btw, the service was nice.)On a slightly not-so-bad note, my friends got Spanish ham with white asparagus and duck with lentil, and they thought it was fine.However, the disappointment does not end there. We continued onto dessert. We got the lemon pot & cassis, buttermilk pudding with Bramley apples and salted caramel sauce, flourless chocolate cake, and a cheese plate. The presentation of the buttermilk pudding was so unappealing. All 3 components combined onto one plate; it looked like chew-less food served at a nursing home. The other 3 desserts were fine; nothing spectacular.Our tab (minus the beef) ran up to \u00a382. This kind of money should not be spent on such a mediocre meal.",

It's been a while since I'd been, and longer since I'd written about it, so thought that a re-review was due. I'm very pleased to say that its place in my personal grubby, food stained list of London's dirty, sexy and cool restaurants is still assured. If you can't cope with the recycled pub schtick, the buzz and irritations of tightly packed, shared tables or are looking for a quiet romantic dinner (at least one that doesn't involve sucking meat juice from your fingers) then steer clear. If you're fond of being hypercritical, you'll be pleased to know it's also unsurprisingly difficult to get a table, even early week, so either get there really, really early or be prepared to wait in the over spilling and rowdy bar. Whinge about that, because you won't be whinging about much else. Arriving late we were lucky enough to stroll straight in. Skipping the usual wait at the bar with it's attendant reasonably priced (if basic) cocktails and well kept pints, we opted for a lovely drop of spicy Douro from the shallow end of the wine list as we took to our rickety wooden chairs at the brushed wood shared farmhouse table at the front. For the Farmer, this was home away from countryside home, particularly when he'd settled long enough to peruse the single sheet menu with its gruff single word descriptors of fish, flesh and fowl. Hunks of fresh tangy sourdough with a huge pot of butter were followed by fresh, fragrant and wonderful British asparagus, succulent green vestal virgins dipped in a sharp hollandaise and decapitated as quickly as we could get them down our greedy little necks. Coming down to the mains eyes and bellies just couldn't resist the whole mustard braised rabbit for two to share. A quick check before committing for both of us - \"How's the rabbit? Worth it?\" The waiters eyes glazed over as under his breath before he smilingly muttered \"it's fucking beautiful guys\". The staff are utterly delightful - when you ask opinions, you really get them. They smile as they reel off the staff dinner menu from last week, smile as they advise a cheaper wine than we were planning on and genuinely seem to love working there. And who wouldn't with this kitchen? I'm tempted to pay for a job here, just to guarantee tasting this food daily, though I'd struggle to get through the tightly packed tables after a week or so of it. The Farmer has the most marvellous day job, a classically trained singer for hire (like a gun for hire but with marginally better better life prospects, despite the hairy tour tales he has), it'd be a cliche, not to mention untrue, if I said he was singing in praise of it. That being said, there was a contented hum from us both as we sucked the last bones dry. Soft, slow braised bunny in a creamy sauce sopped up with triple cooked chips. It's not a healthy option, but when it tastes this good you just don't care.",

    "text": "Even on a Monday we had to wait one hour for a place to sit down and eat at this place. As we were so hungry regretably we took up the invitation to sit at the bar counter which was a big mistake. Crammed inbetween some office workers who had come in for a drink we had to endure an abysmal meal which I regret paying for. Anyway food was one fo the reasons why I came here and the other was to have a look at the environment.I was quite impressed with worn wooden floor boards and high celings-its what they call a proper boozer.Numbed by a vast amount of alcohol we carefully avoided the snails,bacon and laver bread on duck fat toast;or the octopus,chickpeas,roast tomatoe and aoili.Instead we made a wise move and headed for the main course -I had the tender leg of Duck with mirabelle-plums but they were very sweet,and what put me off was that the dish arrived lukewarm,and to add insult to injury the tasty side dish of lentils arrived after I had consumed the duck. Looking back on the experience I feel perhaps this place is better suited to large groups as many of their daily changing dishes reflect that-i.e.(the seven hour lamb shoulder).The only redeeming factor of the meal was the Pistachio Cake which was dense,fruity,nutty served with a creamy lemon curd.",

    "text": "Had an absolutely shocking and disgusting evening at the Anchor and Hope. Having drank on a number of occasions at the bar with colleagues after work, I decided to go for food with my girlfriend and a couple of friends on Friday night as the food always looked tempting. Firstly I knew that there were no table reservations so we got there early, and got our name on the wait list. We were told 20 minutes and got some drinks at the bar. We ordered 2 beers, and 2 glasses of white wine. The wine was served in little tumble glasses that were filled to the brim. When we politely asked the barman if we could transfer them into a wine glass, we got a very abrupt and extremely rude NO! I pointed out that the there were others at the bar who had wine glasses, and yet the response was still NO as apparently it was the bars policy to only serve wine bought by the bottle in wine glasses! The fact that we would be buying a few bottles at the dinner table once seated didn't count for anything, so the partners had to carefully manoeuvre a ridiculous glass to their mouths taking a sip being careful not to spill it all down their dresses!! 20 minutes was in fact 45 minutes to be seated, and at the time, my friend had slipped out for a cigarette. Instead of a normal welcome to the restaurant can I take your coats we got Where is the 4th person?!!! from a waitress with what were the worst stained teeth I have ever seen. That was followed by a We cannot hold the table if he does not return in the next few minutes! ironically the restaurant had several available tables. My friend came in from the outside, and we were given the menus. After the rude teeth stained waiter had given us the menus and swiftly crossed off the venison, there were 2 main courses left available on the menu, one of which was the vegetarian option!! That was the final nail in the coffin! We looked at each other, got up, and left. My experience of the Anchor and Hope was by far the worst restaurant encounter I have ever had. Go here if you like waiting, want to drink wine from small tumblers (because some idiot behind the bar must think that it is trendy), and want to be made to feel about as welcome as a fart in a spacesuit! Never going to go back here againnot even for drinks after work!",

We had sprats, followed by oxtail and a date pudding. We shared a table for 6 with two other couples and by the end of the evening we were sharing our pudding and wine with all of them! The atmosphere is contageously friendly. The staff were lovely too. Another thing we came on a saturday at about 6, had one gin&tonic and were seated. The place operates on two rolling seatings, so if you arrive in the middle you will definately have to wait!",

So if you have a sense of humour, arent in a rush and have money to spend then try the Anchor and Hope.",

    "text": "Having lived on Lower Marsh I am even more disappionted by the Hope an Anchor. Went in tonight with a chef friend of mine and ordered Razor Clams (barman know last one's available and ordered) hence 1 star. Also ordered Octupus salad which turned out to be some chewy tubes and a pretty average tomato sauce now both of these Below \u00a37.00 which is ok not very good but ok. Then we add the ham and Picallilly and then it really goes wrong \u00a315.00 for some lovely ham worth say \u00a35.00 in a restaraunt and then Picallily which turns out to be crisp cauliflower (good) plus crisp green beans (good) and then dressed in some dreadful white sauce. I have no idea what this has to do with Picillily but for \u00a315.00 pounds I expected at least some crusty bread. All in all it wouldn't have been so bad if the waitress in helping us resolve our problem hadn't been so rude. We paid for our beer and also the razor clams but then we just got left waiting at bar as if she needed to prove a point. Whatever happened to the customer is right. I guess after a while you brlieve your own hype.",
