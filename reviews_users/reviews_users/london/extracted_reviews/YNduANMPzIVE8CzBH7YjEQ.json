    "text": "Such a simple breakfast, but so so good! Came here the morning after landing in London and was pleasantly surprised. My boyfriend and I arrived slightly past 8am on a Saturday morning, but there was already a short line. The place is CASH ONLY, so be sure to have some on hand. While in line, we started chatting with a frequent customer here who recommended a couple of typical English breakfast items that were good here. Bubble and Hash which is basically mashed potatoes with cabbage and black pudding which is basically blood sausage. Although black pudding doesn't necessarily sound appealing, it was actually very good as was everything else. We both got the breakfast deal which included bacon, eggs, toast, choice of beans or grilled tomatoes, and choice of tea or coffee and added all of the extras to share including hashbrown, mushroom, bubble and hash and the black pudding. The breakfast was so simple, affordable and delicious that we made it back here TWICE during our 4 day stay in London. Definitely recommend!",

Once you get used to that, you won't get distracted from your food and won't have to halt your conversations with others anymore. Note this place only takes cash!",

    "text": "Having worked a short walk away from The Regency for over 7 years you'd think that I would've been here more than twice...but you'd be wrong. Today was my second visit to this brilliant cafe. A cafe so brilliant that you have to get her well before 12 to miss out on the massive queue out the door.We arrived around 11:50 and had to wait about 20 mins to order out food. The rule is that you order before you sit down and this rule keeps the tables ticking over nicely.The lovely lady at the counter is a bit Jekkyl and Hyde... Very polite and softly spoken as you're ordering but a booming \"builders cafe\" voice when calling out the orders ready to be collected. This all adds to the great, bustling atmosphere.One this occasion I opted for the Set Breakfast (egg, 2 bacon, sausage, a choice of beans or tomatoes, a choice of bread or toast and a choice of tea or coffee) with beans, bread, extra hash browns and black pudding and a cup of tea. I was disappointed that I had arrived too late for the bubble and squeak. All meals are customisable for a price so you can pretty much combine most things on the menu as far as I can see. It took less than 10 minutes before I heard \"Set, beans, hash browns and black pudding\" hollered from the countered and I was sat down demolishing a brilliant all day breakfast. All the ingredients are high quality, nothing tastes cheap and you're guaranteed a full belly at the end of it.I will always come back to The Regency. It may take me 4 or 5 years between visits but I love it today as much as the first time I went.Oh, and did I mention that a rather famous scene from the film Layer Cake with Daniel Craig was filmed in there...?",

I've had Regency Cafe on my bookmark list for ages, but since it closes at 12 on the weekends and I like to sleep in, it hasn't happened... until now and boy is it worth it.I can understand the 12:00 close for breakfast. They seem to have a constant queue of customers craving an English brekkie and have it timed perfectly as they seem to run out of food at just about noon. Upon arrival, the queue seems a bit intimidating, but it's one of the most efficient queues I've seen in London. The main guy takes your order, fixes your drinks and makes the toast while also yelling out orders for pick up and doesn't miss a beat. He knows exactly who's ordered what and obviously has rapport with repeat customers. If you're a local, it's the place you want to be on a Saturday morning.And then there's the food. It's simple, but it's delicious. I had 2 eggs over easy on 2 toasts plus sausage and hash browns.... REAL hash browns, not potatoes, hash browns. Hit the spot, perfect fry up, and definitely worth waking up early for.",

It's a real shame as when they are this good they surpass any other breakfast on offer. For six quid the full English, complete with bacon, sausages, egg, beans, tea/coffee and bread/toast is out of this world. I'd recommend adding the homemade hash browns for an additional 90p. As in all traditional cafes the coffee is crap so stick with the tea.We were so stuffed afterwards that we had to walk our bikes for half hour before cycling back across town.

Moreover, you start thinking, how am I going to get a table for 8? Somehow, it just happens. The micromanaging type A behind the counter is making it work. Mushroom and onion pie with beans and chips were our orders. Kids ordered spaghetti bolognese. Family was happy and it was the perfect place for our first meal in the UK. Arriving at 12:30 was rush hour, but by the time we left at 2, you could have your choice of seats. Yes, even the one where Daniel Craig filmed his role. \u00a0If you have that friend who takes forever to order, this place is not for them.

It was 10.45am but who cares!Now normally I am slightly cautious about ordering things like fish and chips from a cafe ie not a chippy but this place is something else. It was honestly some of the best cod I have ever tasted, so fresh and perfectly white. Very good.The place has a wide spectrum of customers including tradesmen, office guys and the odd tourist who has read about it.The prices are freakishly low and the service is friendly and efficient.

If I ever return to London, this will be my first stop.",

We got there about 9 and by the time we left at 10:30 the line was atleast 50 people deep OUTSIDE. The line inside moves \u00a0quickly and I was impressed that the small staff handled so many people so efficiently. The man who was the manager/order taker/owner was so impressive with how he was so fast yet so kind when it came to ordering. The breakfast was so good! I will certainly everytime I come to London go to the Regency Cafe for breakfast. P.S. It is not that far(walking distance) from MI6.",

So if you decide to visit the Palace you might as well stop here for breakfast. \u00a0A breakfast special included 1 egg, 1 sausage, 2 bacon slices; a choice of tomatoes or baked beans, toast or bread and tea or coffee! I opted for baked beans, toast and tea! It was so freaken good! I added hash browns for 90 pence and blood sausage for another 90 pence. In all my boyfriend and I spent 15 pounds for breakfast! This is practically a steal! The interior has a retro dinner feel and lots of locals come to this diner. The owner was nice and the food came out quick. Tip: order first and pick up your own food.

I'm not a local, but I wanted to try this place after reading all the reviews raving about this \"authentic London institution.\" I couldn't agree more!The line was out the door, but moved quickly. The older man at the register was taking orders, cashiering money, expediting food, and pouring coffee all at once! He even called out our orders by name! Even though the environment seemed rushed, he was still attentive enough to make sure I got my toast, coffee, and juice :)I split the full English breakfast (7 pounds) with an extra order of hashbrowns, bubble & squeak, and orange juice! I'm American so I've never tried bubble and squeak before (baked potatoes with onions in cream?), but it was pretty bland and heavy. The sausage was really yummy though, not too fatty--and I'm not even a fan of sausage. The bacon was salty, but it tasted good with the soft egg and crispy hashbrowns.It's also walking distance from London Victoria train station!",

I give four stars as the food and coffees/teas were bog standard.

I didn't get the near-religious fervor that seemed to surround this place; the food was just okay, as expected. It wasn't bad for what it was, but there's only so much one can do with bacon (not the thinly fried slices we're used to) and beans. I ordered a side of black pudding as well, which was okay.",

With that out of the way here's what I thought...This place is incredible. I got there around 10am and it was packed. Soon after I ordered there was a line out the door and it didn't slow down during the 45 minutes I sat and enjoyed my breakfast. I ordered the breakfast special, also my first full English breakfast. I received a HUGE plate full of baked beans, 2 sausages, an egg, 2 large strips of bacon, and 2 pieces of toast. I was a little scared of the baked beans at first but then I dug in and found that the mixture was delightful plate of heart stopping greatness! The sausages were something different, I can't really put my finger on it but it was almost if the filling was breaded or something...probably the best breakfast sausages I've ever had. I thoroughly enjoyed everything on my plate then sopped up all the leftovers with my toast and downed the rest of my tea. This breakfast really made my day and in fact I didn't have to eat anything until my dinner later that night, which is a whole other story (Fifteen London). I'm so glad that Matthew Vaughn introduced me to this place in his movie. Now I'm stopping in on every visit I make to London.",

The line wasn't out the door but there was definitely a wait...beneficial to my husband because he had to absorb the menu. I did a great job ordering and got the set breakfast, black pudding (which sounds more appetizing than blood sausage), chips, beans and tea with milk. This is A LOT of food!! Hubs got the omelet with chips. So amazing and filling! We walked around London all day and didn't really get hungry until around 9 or so. The ambiance is fantastic!

Ordered the set breakfast deal and all I got was a blank stare and a \"I don't understand.\" He told me to have a read and asked the person after me to order. After ordering it again I watched as he interacted with other customers. Specific ones he was very friendly with. Telling them to come in and take their time looking at the menu. Other times telling people they could not sit down until they ordered when another group did the same thing but did not get the same treatment. As for the food, it was overly salty and just mediocre. Nothing special. Highly overrated. If I had known I'd get breakfast elsewhere.",

    "text": "We who are about to dine, salute you! The Regency Cafe is undoubtedly one of culinary jewels in Westminster's crown. First there's the 1940s original tiled interior, large windows and classic sign, which have featured in car adverts and the film Layer Cake. Then there's the moulded seating, complete with brown sauce, salt, vinegar and ketchup bottles for diners. Next there's the guy who takes your order, politely and respectfully noting your desired dish, and then later proceeding to announce its arrival from the kitchen with a bellowed \"PIE AND CHIPS!\") across the cafe when it's ready. And finally, the food, which is in a class of its own for honest, greasy spoon grub. Two dishes deserve special mention: First, the thick, roughly cut chips, which are deep fried on the spot. I don't know of many other places in London that come close, fish 'n chip shops included. Second, the bread and butter pudding which is likely to be like no other bread 'n butter effort you've encountered before: a collosal serving of approximately 5 slices of white bread with generous amounts of butter, sultanas and cinnamon in between, doused in hot steaming custard. It's quite simply the best bread and butter pudding I've tasted: my colleagues unanimously felt likewise.Prices are impressively competitive too - main dishes don't cost much more than a fiver and the bread and butter pudding a scarcely believable \u00a31.60. It's not surprising then that this place is hugely popular at lunchtimes, with a queue of students, builders and office workers often leading up to and out of the door. It's best to arrive before 12:30 if you can, but even if you have to wait (and to be fair, the queue does move quickly), it's going to be worth it.",

The cashier was friendly and is a wonder at multi-tasking. Good sense of humor too. I got the set breakfast (\u00a35.50) and at the recommendation of other Yelpers, added on the hash browns and black pudding (90p each). The food came out very quickly and was delicious! Definitely can pass on the recommendation of the 2 add-ons. I thought the cost of the food was a great deal. And that's coming from a frugal accounting graduate who's been backpacking across Europe for the past 2 months. The diner has a great atmosphere about it, was clean, and the busboys promptly cleaned the tables. And to top it all off, the cashier said a thank you to each customer as they headed out the door.",

But this was their combo special which comes with 1 fried egg, 2 bacons, 1 sausage, baked beans and toast (choice of white or wheat) or just bread and coffee or juice. i asked for an additional egg because.....we eats just ONE? \u00a0 the beau went crazy and ordered the liver sandwich which is exactly what it is, pieces of liver stuffed between 2 white pieces of bread. he also ordered orange juice which comes in a jar and they give you glasses to fill them in. our order total came out to \uffe110.50 which may seem like a GREAT deal.....until you convert it...and realized it actually cost $15 (-_-) that's London for ya.other than the price, the food was wonderful and the service was really friendly. theres this lady probably in her 40's that works the counter and man, she's a beast! taking all the orders, grabs the beverages, prepares the toast and bellows out your order once its ready! the only thing she doesnt do is go into the kitchen and cooks the food!the people working here are genuinely really nice. just a few notes: its cash only, there are no restrooms here and order first before grabbing a seat!",

    "text": "I love me a good English breakfast and nothing was as good and affordable as Regency Cafe. I spent 10 days in London and went to an English breakfast eatery every other day (I am not a heathen!) and this by far was the best one.The location is small, on a corner street, and the tables were pretty full when I got there. The fine people of London are considerate and they move fast so other folks can get a table. I saw other people come up to a large table and ask if a spot was taken and they accommodated without hesitation.What gets me is the owner of this place. A fit, small, and short-haired older woman who can bellow out orders like a football captain. When I first walked up to the queue, I thought some big burly chef from the back was calling out the orders but it was the lady running the registers!I ordered the set breakfast which consisted of eggs, bean, sausage, bacon, and toast. For an extra 90 pence each I received hashbrowns and a fried tomato as well. Total damage done with Tea and Orange juice was just 8.90 pounds. Wow! If you're looking for a traditional English breakfast, this place is the bees-knees and I hope I threw enough British lingo in this review to make me sound like I am a native ;-)Cheers!",

So the premise is, you queue up to order and then take a seat and when your food is ready, the lady taking your order shouts it out! The funny thing is, she is very softly spoken when taking your order hit as soon as the food comes out, her voice totally changes! I ordered the breakfast for \u00a35.55 and for an extra 90p had a block of bubble and squeak on the side however you can also order a portion of hash browns (3 pieces) or black pudding. The breakfast came with 2 pieces of toast and butter, a fried egg, one sausage, two rashers of bacon and beans and a cup of tea or coffee. I also got an orange juice which is ordered in straight from the dairy and served in milk bottle which I thought was quite novel. The decor is like an old fashioned cafe, white tiles on the wall and plastic chairs with random pictures adorning the walls. I loved this place and I really want to go back and have some lunch there!",

The english breakfast is great. You can get all of the staples and trimming and probalby won't spend more than 15 lbs. Regencey Cafe is also quite accessible from the touristy areas. You have to walk, but the area is quite nice and easy to navigate. while the food is good, i've never been a big fan of the english breakfast, so I wouldn't have come here except for the fact that a friend wanted to, but it was totally worth it. You can tell the staff has been doing this for awhile. The orders are put out rapid fire and while a bit abrasive, the attitudes of everybody are actually more confident and rather warm once you get talking with them. The facilities are pretty average if not below it, but what do you expect from a diner type restaurant? I would drop by anytime you are in the area. It is well worth it. It might not impress anybody, but it'll beat almost anything else you make at home hungover.",

    "text": "Ever since this little cafe was listed in the Wall Street Journal as one of the yelpiest places in London, I had bookmarked it. Alas, months went by without me converting that bookmark into action...and I was already afraid that by the time I would finally get there, the place would be so overrun that it'd lost its yelpiness. (As I've witnessed many times when hidden gems get written up by major publications.)I am happy to report: all good. The place is (still) amazing and the owner still loudly shouting out the orders when they're ready. In a parallel world, this guy would be an opera singer for sure, with such a baritone voice; imagine Pavarotti shouting \"two eggs with beans and hash browns coming up!\"Here's a tutorial on how to order:* make sure you've got cash on you* you need to place your order before grabbing a seat, so get in line* while in line, take advantage of this and watch the folks rotating behind the counter and in the kitchen; it truly is the perfect human assembly line* get the set breakfast and customize it as you like (if there's two or more of you, I recommend getting a bottle if fresh orange juice as well)* once you've placed your order, go find a seat and listen to your order being shouted out* enjoy your food* afterwards I highly recommend a digestive walk along the nearby Thames...May this place stay like this for a very long time...it's timeless and perfect as it is.",

When your order is up, the man taking orders calls it out and you go and fetch it. This was quick! Under ten minutes from when I placed my order till I was eating it.They offer a variety of breakfast specials, or a la carte. I chose the fried tomatoes, \u00a0mushrooms, hash browns, chips, and 2 eggs. Also a cup of tea and a bottle of orange juice. The eggs were perfectly cooked. Not runny in the slightest but still with a soft enough yolk for dipping. The mushrooms were savory and well cooked, the tomatoes also. Hash browns and chips were fried just right; crispy and delicious. Writing this review is making me hungry! I'll certainly be back in the morning. I went in around 11:15 am, brunch... not too crowded but definitely busy. Ample seating and good atmosphere. The portion was very generous, and the price was unbeatable. My entire meal cost about \u00a37.30, including juice and tea!",

Super rude service, and okay food. \u00a0The woman behind the counter is a real yeller, with a very deep voice, which I think adds to the charm. \u00a0A lot of yelpers (even my brother) talk about a man yelling, maybe there is a male who also does this?This is how my experience went:Arrived with cash (no credit accepted), waited patiently in the queue for 25 min, practised how to orderme: I'll have the set breakfast, with tomato her: and you? (to my friend, the second I finished my last syllable)I wasn't done yet. I want a side of hash browns. So, when my friend finished ordering, I said \"and also, can I have a side of hash browns please?\" \u00a0She rolls her eyes, sighs, writes it down, looks rudely at us, and asks \"anything else?\" with her hands in the air (like a 'hold up' style). RUDE. Keep in mind, the lady was very cheerful and patient with the man ahead in queue, who kept amending his order. My order was over in 12 seconds - he took a minute or more. You wait in queue for a bit, and it stops moving periodically - pretty sure they intentionally delay the queue so that tables clear up (makes sense). So, you can always find a table, no problem. The food - nothing to write home about. The bacon was way overly salty. The tomatoes are canned. \u00a0The sausage was ok. Egg and toast were good. I added one star for the Ok food, but the service was shit..however it seems to be hit or miss judging by the way others were received.",

My boyfriend and I came here around 11am on a Thursday which was good timing because this place looks to be constantly busy, full of locals and tourists. A long line quickly formed after 11:30 but the execution and delivery of food is rather quick once your order is put in. Order first and then sit. I ordered the breakfast deal which included an egg, sausage, bacon, beans or tomatoes, bread or toast. I got an add-on of black pudding and hash browns which was absolutely delicious. Everything was really delicious. Simple yet full of flavor and tasted freshly cooked. For a meal under 10 pounds, this was well worth it. The hash browns were nice and crispy, bacon was salty and well-cooked, beans were soft and plentiful, black pudding was black and delicious for the more adventurous eaters. A great last meal. I would definitely come back again if ever in the area.",

Their English breakfast is one of the best in England you'll find! The fish and chips on a Friday are a must! The fish is very fresh and they have a variety of different types of fish. The chips are the typical English 'chippy' style! Other items on the menu are also delicious such as their chicken fillet burger and the mushroom and chicken pie. Price: Very affordable and reasonable, given the central London location. However it is cash only (with no nearby cash machine!)Atmosphere: Very traditional and old English cafe that hasn't had a refurbishment since it's establishment by the looks of it! Their are plenty of locals and the cafe has a very homely feel. One of the only remaining 'old school' English cafes! Highly recommend this for a visit!",

The beans really threw me for the loop but considering the bacon, this meal will keep you full until dinner. Aside from the meal, we were quite entertained my the lady taking and passing out food orders. She is very soft spoken during the ordering process but once the food was ready to be picked up, she transforms into a public announcement system speaker. She definitely keeps this place running in tip top order.",

We got two dishes:- egg and chips- sausage, well done egg, beansA couple of odd observations:- The texture of the scrambled egg was so odd, it was so fluffy that it looked like soft tofu or pudding/custard, especially as you slice through the egg. It was strange. The egg was also rather unspiced, but maybe thats the norm and its best left to the consumer to dress the egg.- The size of each dish was rather disproportionate. The egg and chips was a heaping plate, while the sausage, egg and beans was lacking.Regardless, it was a relaxing spot to have breakfast at an affordable price.",

Given the summer like weather (finally), the doors were open and even at 10am, we saw that it was quite full inside.Based on advice from previous reviews and tips, we knew exactly what we wanted before we reached the front of the line and had cash ready for payment.Full English and corned beef with a side of mushrooms with orange juice. (The full English comes with tea or coffee) The mushrooms were really really good. The bacon was thicker than the really flimsy ones you get st some places, but not too thick. Sausage was lovely and the eggs, cut through the saltiness of the meats.There were a lot of chips and we could not finish that, I also saw them left over in a lot of other plates around.Bread is white, coffee is standard- with or without milk. This is not a fancy coffee place where you can order a low fat soy Macha latte. It's down-to-earth food, served up with all the affection of a harried mum in the kitchen at breakfast time.",

I did all my research of where to go eat as my husband and I love to eat. When I saw the good reviews and rating on yelp, well I wanted to give it a shot so we went one morning. Unfortunately that morning I didn't feel like sausages, beans and stuff like that so I was looking for something that would make my sweet tooth happy. When I asked for a slice of cake, the guy behind the cashier (I think he was the owner) rolled his eyes at me, was irritated with me and made me feel so uncomfortable and so stupid for asking a simple slice of cake. Apparently the cake was only for lunch so I had to order toasts and eggs but I was so upset that I didn't even touch my plate. I would never go back and I do not recommend this place if you want to have a nice time and a good experience. They need to work on their customer service!",

I was watching the new Bletchley circle this weekend and I was crazy with excitement to see it on the show. When we travel we like to experience what the locals enjoy so on our trip to the UK last year my hubby found it on yelp and loved the description of the owner. We took a bus and had a \u00a0wonderful experience. The owner is a character. We still tell everyone about his great way of pouring the tea. The food was typical British breakfast food. We cannot wait to return to London and I want to go back to experience this place again. The street outside looks like a movie set and I love the way the place inside looks untouched for 60 years. I am sure there was minimal set dressing required for the Bletchley circle plot.",

My valiance was rewarded generously with a heap of complicated order fry-up--complete with runny yolks (and charmingly runny hot chocolate).Don't be intimidated by the Regency.

Meets all our criteria. Little did we know what we were walking into.We must have gotten there at the right time because by the time we got our food and sat down, the line was out the door. Even if we would have needed to wait in a line, it would have been worth it. This restaurant is just about as cute and British as they come. I wanted to go back every day of my trip, but knew I needed to explore other places.You can get a pretty traditional full English breakfast but I opted for some a la carte offerings. My friends wanted to experience the full English and they really loved everything on the plate. There wasn't a crumb left when they were done. I got some chips (fries) with my breakfast because it was on the menu and really, why not? I mean, we eat hash-browns and home-fries with breakfast, so why not regular fries. I am seriously considering starting to order this in the states. If you are in London and want a great breakfast, go here.",

Sticking to the basics is simple - you get one over-easy (or as it appears to be called in the UK, fried) egg, British-style bacon, sausage, baked beans (certainly not something I've eaten at breakfast usually, or even in a while), and toast. The price is reasonable by UK standards (5.50 pounds), and you certainly get a full plate's worth of food. The meats are done well; in particular I was a fan of the sausage. Everything else was pretty standard by my tastes. Aside from the price (which is expensive to us Yanks with the depreciating dollar), I do wish we could've been served a simple glass of water instead of tea.All in all, though, a very solid breakfast joint, and I'd come back if I wasn't looking for anything too fancy.",

There's a long line, there's not much choice in breakfast (it's pretty much just full English breakfast and Eggs Benedict). I got the Eggs Benedict because I had eaten sausage for 4 straight days prior. It was a very mediocre Eggs Benedict. NYC places would treat Eggs Benedict as a work of art. This place treated it as a chore. It did have a sort of charm, though, as did the man fronting the operation. He was a very English guy, with an unusual amount of charm, energy, and efficiency (yet still quintessentially English) He was taking everyone's orders and coordinating the kitchen folk, and seemed to love his life and his job. Stand-up guy! The food is prosaic, as is the ambience, decor, and the uniforms of the worker. Only in England could you find this, but it's beautiful.

It is likely a combination the wonderful sense of familiarity you get when a term of endearment is sent your direction and far too much exposure to British literature, TV and movies.Not only was I called \"Love\" by the proprietor, this place FELT like love. It felt like home, like I had just sat down at the table of Nonnatus House, or made my way in the The Burrow, or that I could soon be accosted by Mrs Bennet telling me that Netherfield had let at last!Sadly, I was sick when I found my way into this slice of heaven. AND YET, I had what I would call the best egg sandwich of my life. Thick slices of white bread I wanted to rest my head on, and eggs cooked to perfection, with fresh ground pepper and salt. I have dreamed about this sandwich almost daily since having it.I love that the tea comes out of a big urn, and that the menu is simple and hearty. I love that it feels like you are part of the family when they call your name to get your plate. I love EVERYTHING about this place. It will become a mainstay of all my London visits, and it should be a definite stop for you, if you're in the city.",

    "text": "I don't know what I was thinking- I have very few pictures of this place. Wish I took more pictures. Their English breakfast is delicious. And the best bang for your buck. No actual vegetarian option, so I did a lot of adding and switching with my other half to create one: beans, has browns, eggs, bubble and swueemThere were a bunch of options, most of which I didn't understand, but they were patient as I fumbled through choices for coffee or tea, with cream & sugar? toast or bread (bread is lovely), bubble and squeak...? What? As you can tell from above, customer service was great. It's kind of confusing because you don't get a number. They just call out your order and you go and get it.Since we were clearly from out of country, we just kind of sat down and wandered up every time something sounded like ours. The lady just glanced at us and shook her head until it was ours, and then she finally said, yes, this is yours. But not horribly. Just matter of fact. It's definitely an experience worth having, even though there's not really a close bus stop. The food was well worth it.",

We went and got the traditional bacon, bread, beans and eggs, my bf got tomato instead of beans and both broadened our horizon! They are good of course but it is the experience of eating traditional English breakfast with Londoners that we love and cherish a lot. If there is another opportunity I will definitely go back to London and go to regency cafe again! Oh please note this place is cash only but does not shadow any beauty of this little historical great restaurant!!! There is even a picture and autograph of Al Pacino on the wall, how awesome is that?!!!!",

I came here by myself on an early Monday morning with two weeks' worth of luggage; I had just gotten off of an overnight bus from Paris and was absolutely famished. I ended up sitting at a 2-top table relaxing and planning out my day for a good three hours, and never once did I feel rushed by the staff.I did already know what I wanted to order (breakfast deal + hashbrowns), but the workers were still friendly and one thoroughly recommended the black pudding. Everything was absolutely delicious! Ratings of individual foods:Black pudding - 5/5 (love that stuff)Hashbrowns - 5/5 (served super hot and so yummy, but let's be real.. when are hashbrowns not good)Tomato - 5/5 (always a sucker for a good grilled tomato)Egg - 4/5 (fine. it's an egg)Sausage - 3/5 (a little oily and salty for my taste)Toast - 3/5 (always meh in my opinion)Bacon - 3/5 (also very oily and not hot enough)Coffee - 6/5 (don't know what it was about this coffee, but it was absolutely STELLAR! they sprinkle some sort of cocoa / cinnamon on top that takes it from good to great)Overall very impressed with this place. You'd be hard pressed to find a better place in London for an affordable and delicious English breakfast!",

    "text": "Walking into Regency Cafe was like stepping back in time. This 70's diner serves simple meals for all day long. My bf and I had an early tour to get to on our last trip to London and Regency was on the way to the bus station so we stopped by for some breakfast. We were surprised at how much we liked this neighbourhood gem that we came back again on our last day. As a Canadian tourist, this is one of the few restaurants that served affordable food without breaking our vacation budget. If you're coming in the morning, it's filled with locals and construction workers because of how early it opens. I loved sitting by the window and people watching while I ate my first meal of the day. Being a tourist, it's always interesting to see how others start off their work day in a different city. If you're coming during the lunch hour rush don't even attempt to hold a table - you're not allowed, there will be a sign saying this. When I say lunch hour rush, I really mean it - expect a line, sometimes extending outside the doors and around the corner. You're welcome to come grab lunch and dine-in, but I would watch the time to make sure that you're not overstaying and being respectful of other people who want to sit and eat. There is no table service here. You order at the cash desk, and wait for your order to be called. I don't believe they call numbers so I would recommend that you remember what you ordered :)",

    "text": "I didn't really anticipate this place being my favorite meal in London - but it was pretty much no contest. After some decently pricey meals in Europe, Regency Cafe is an absolute steal for some ridiculously well done breakfast. We ordered a big plate of breakfast and an carafe of OJ (which was only 50p!!! Why am I being charged like 8 dollars for orange juice in the US?).Our breakfast had Eggs, Hash Browns, Sausage and Bacon, Black Pudding, and Tomatoes along with a side of toast. It was a little too much for us particularly because of how heavy everything was, but it was DELICIOUS.Sometimes I don't really know why breakfast can taste so good. Everything is simple. But they absolutely crush it with their execution.I wasn't sure about black pudding having never had it, but it was quite delicious. I'd compare it to eating sausage with a little bit of an earthiness to it. The tomatoes were key as the acidity helped with all the heaviness of the greasy meats. Everything else was just great.I'd definitely encourage people to try and show up early. When we left a little after noon or so, the line was stretching up the block with probably 100 people waiting. We managed to arrive when there were only 20 or so people in line. Seats open up almost perfectly in time by the time orders are made and filled, so don't panic if it seems like a booth won't be available in time.",

Turns out, they really know what they're talking about.It's incredible. A beautiful cafe of a certain vintage, it's all the better for not having been updated. It's unbelievably popular, but I've never struggled to find a seat (and we've been back a fair few times since). The clientele is a mixture of tourists, workers and locals, most of whom look like they're regulars, which is a great sign. I've only ever been for breakfast, but as it's the best full English I've ever had in London, I assume the rest of the menu is also fantastic.Every time I've been with my Mum we've had the same argument - she is convinced that the counter staff wear microphones, as there's no way they can project their voice like that (she's wrong). When you go, you'll know what I'm talking about. Just trust me when I say, definitely order before taking a seat - hell hath no fury like the Regency staff scorned.",

The lunch crowd is rather busy, so you may need to share a table with someone else if you're only one or two people, but I didn't mind too much.Many tasty-sounding choices, but I settled on the vegetarian version of the eggs benedict (normal but ham-less) and chips (because according to reviews they are fantastic). I really enjoyed both, but made the comedic mistake of putting sugar on my chips instead of salt. It took me a while to realize my mistake, too, because the salt shaker was hidden - I thought at first that the chips were just really sweet. Then I finally found the salt shaker and had the second half of my chips in a sweet-n-salty style. It's interesting, you should try it sometime!",

This is not the case at Regency. It's a simple restaurant with an amazing owner (guy at the register) and great overall vibe.The owner patiently waited and helped us decide what to eat. It was affordable (cheap actually for London) and there were so many things we wanted to try. We had baked beans, the bubble and sqeak potato, black bloody sausage, regular sausage, eggs and coffee with milk (comes with a dab of chocolate powder melted) . All delicious and hit the spot.Tables fill up fast here, but everyone is so nice that is here. We want to come back and try other dishes. Perhaps we will!",

I usually hate beans but these beans were pretty good. Picked the bread and not the toast and it was very good. Was just bread and butter.Not sure what the brown sauce really was but t went well with the meal. Great for vegetarians as there was beans and grilled tomatoes and of course eggs :) Choice of tea or coffee as well.",

    "text": "Review #900! Regency Caf\u00e9 was one of the shining stars in my London dining experiences. I forgot whether I found them from searching on Yelp as I was finishing my tour of Buckingham Palace or via a bunch of lists of Must Eats in London, but they are well worth a trip!One thing to note, don't come on a Sunday! They're closed on Sundays! We came back to London last year (2017) and had just finished visiting Buckingham Palace (again! We had the one year pass that barely expired that day.). We walked to Regency Caf\u00e9 and thought we heard the familiar loud bellowing from their female employee that calls out the order. Oh, we were wrong. They were closed that day. =(So let me take you back to our first visit in 2016. We came close to 2 pm and it was still pretty packed, though the queue to order was not too bad. We ordered the steak pie with potatoes and vegetables (\u00a34.30) and the chicken escalope with half salad and half chips (\u00a35.80). Make sure you order first before trying to grab a seat. It worked out that way as more tables freed up after we were waiting for our order. We got our order shortly and dug in. Having not eaten since that morning, we delighted in discovering the food was great along with the price. Hence, we tried coming back the next year and didn't coordinate our trip plans accordingly with their business hours. We'll try again on our next trip to London!",

My husband found The Regency while I was fixing my hair, and we decided the quick walk from our hotel to the restaurant would do us some good. We knew we needed something filling, having only eaten one meal the day before, so we had high hopes for the English breakfast.You have to place your order at the counter - and this place is cash only, so come prepared. The guy working the counter was a seasoned pro with a good sense of humor. He took our order, called out the names of the people whose orders were ready, got us our coffee and popped bread in the toaster for another order as we stood there, money in hand.We did both go with the set English breakfast, adding on the black pudding because we're pigs. That kitchen was going at a breakneck speed, slinging beans and eggs at a record pace.The food was hot and filling, and fairly standard. There are several tables inside, but the only one that was open when we went to sit down faced the door. It was a cold blustery day, so every time that door opened, we froze a bit. Nothing can be done about that, but it was unfortunate.We did leave feeling much more human than when we walked in. We definitely got our money's worth with the amount of food and the speed at which we were served. It's a nice little neighborhood shop that seems to get its fair share of \"usual\" customers.",

    "text": "You want a proper fry-up? Look no further than the Regency Cafe! I recommend all my friends to go here for your typical full English breakfast.This is the real deal: their breakfast is no frills but oh so good (and oh so many calories haha). I've cooked hundreds, maybe even thousands of eggs in my life and ate even more but somehow the Regency's fried eggs taste so much better than anywhere else. Is it the eggs? Is it the cooking technique? Someone please enlighten me!When I was here recently, I noticed how unique this place really is: it fills up quickly in the mornings and it attracts all sorts of people, from construction workers to men in fancy suits mixed with a lot of tourists. All of them stand in line and are united in their love for this breakfast institution. How often do you see that?Maybe I should write a letter to the world leaders to tell them to take the Regency cafe as an example on how to unite people but in the meantime: Move over Avo on toast & granola! I am eating at the Regency Cafe!",

    "text": "Oh goodness. I was so close to not trying out the traditional English style breakfast because I'm not a huge fan of breakfast in general. I also don't care for beans. But my husband and I decided to go because -- come on now, look at how popular it is! Look at the reviews .. how can we forgive ourselves if we didn't give it a try?We went to Regency Cafe for some brunch before we left London so we got there at around 11 am. We were lucky that when we got there, the line was not long. Keep in mind that you have to order first before you sit your butt down. No such thing as saving seats! My husband and I got a breakfast plate with bacon, eggs, sausage link, tomatoes, hash browns, blood sausage and tomatoes. We also decided to share an eggs benedict, as well as an orange juice. The breakfast plate comes with coffee or tea and it is an AMAZINGLY good price. I think it was maybe $6-7 USD? It comes basic (bacon, eggs, tomatoes or beans, sausage link) but you can add hash browns, blood sausage, etc. They also had lunch menus on the items if you aren't interested in breakfast. And they have a different special each day. Forget the eggs benedict -- the breakfast plate was where it's at! Everything was so DELICIOUS. It just hits the spot -- filled with savory goodness. The only issue is that it is a bit on the heavy side of things and after a while, everything becomes really salty. I had to take a pepcid after the meal because when a meal is too greasy, I start getting nauseous. I would probably suggest you sharing the plate with someone else. Oh and do try to come before the rush. The line gets REALLY long. It literally goes out the door and down the street. It gets especially busy during lunch hours. You'll see business people coming here to grab food on their lunch break. Regency Cafe is definitely the place to come for the proper English breakfast. Cheap, delicious, and quick!",

We took the Underground to St James station getting lost along the way, we exited the wrong part of the station as usual. When we finally arrived this place reminded of an old school breakfast joint, English style. I had the eggs, toast, sausage, ham and beans. I'm not big on pork and beans type beans , but not bad. I ate my wife sausage and ham so I was in heaven. The lady(maybe owner) had a set of lungs, when your order was done you could be down the block and hear her yell in her unique way, but very nice too. Good food for a good price, a rarity these days.",

Because this was my first meal in Europe and it did not disappoint. \u00a0 --- \u00a0 --- \u00a0 ---For the rest of my life, I'll never forget:\"DOUBLE EGG, BEANS, TOH-MAH-TOE\"As you enter the facility, you hear some guy yelling out orders at the counter as they're ready. It's a bellowing voice that echoes through the halls of our the building and your brain. It's like going to breakfast AND the opera. Much to my shock, as we get closer to the front of the line, I realized that it was a woman yelling out orders! It was shocking and impressive that she was able to go so deep with her baritone. And the absolute best part was that she would go from her gladiator to a gentle/normal voice so seamlessly when taking your order. \"...BEANS, TOH-MAH-TOE, and yes, you had the hash browns as well?\" It was amazing. If you're reading this and don't understand why I've spent all this time talking about this woman yelling, you just need to see it for yourself.Aside from the entertainment, the meal was great too! And cheap! I ordered the set breakfast, which was bacon, sausage and egg - while adding on beans and toast. Two things stood out to me about this: bacon in Europe is different than bacon in the U.S. and in a good way. It;s large and thick, more so like ham than bacon. But it's very flavorful, and I definitely wish we had bacon like that over here! The other thing that stood out was that I'd never had baked beans for breakfast. I wasn't sure if I'd like it, but I ended up being a huge fan. Maybe it's something I need to try on occasion while I'm at home.This was one of the cheapest meals we had in Europe and definitely a memorable one!",

I recognised the interior from various TV programmes and photoshoots that had taken place here. The interior is what you'd expect of a traditional British greasy spoon, a look that has been hijacked and reproduced by overpriced hipster eateries across the city, but you can always tell an original! The prices here can't be beat, and though its a greasy spoon, vegetarians aren't forgotten!There's little more I can add to the glowing reviews above and below. Delicious, generous portions of food, served efficiently, and GREAT value. I'd recommend getting here in the mid-morning, before the queues. Best chips I've had anywhere in England, and I adore a good chipper. As you take your fill, drink in the classic interior and the characters sitting at the tables around you. Be polite, don't gawk, don't take too many pictures. Afterward, admire the nearby 1930s Sir Edward Lutyens' buildings on Page Street, and stroll to Tate Britain to take in a dramatically different facet of British culture.",

I was a little intimidated at first because it looked heavily populated with locals (or at least regulars) but when I stepped up and gave the main guy my bumbling order, he was very patient and kind. After that (and asking where we were from which pleased him) I felt as welcome as anyone in the place. Then came the food. When I picked up the plates, the locals at the counter said \"THAT'S a breakfast.\" Yes it was! Eggs, tomato and mushrooms, hash, sausage, bacon and toast! A proper full English just as I like it! Delicious and filling! I wish I lived here to frequent this place much more. Quite possibly the perfect diner!",

Especially when quality is taken under the consideration. - Great and several options for those who are not into full English breakfast. I hate beans in tomato sauce!- The kitchen efficiency and organization is fun to watch while waiting.- The cakes: b&b pudding or layer cake are to die for. Perfect to share!- The set of lungs on the cashiers calling the orders to be picked up: they could hold jobs at the Opera!Cons:- This is where tourists need to go but sadly it's way off the tourist usual tracks.- As tourist or newbie you need a manual first on how to order or behave.- Almost always busy so not for the timid who can't share tables with strangers.",

Decent priced, decent grub for the hard working men and women of the post war years. Formica tables, gingham curtains, a rattling coffe machine and cabbies sucking up industrial strength cups of tea. OK it's 50 years on now, but the Regent hasn't seemingly changed much from that socialist post war ideal, albeit that the brickie can't have a smoke after his ham, eggs, fried slice and the cabbie squeezes in amid more monied Pimlico residents and trendy Asian tourists (the latter location spotting from photoshoots in Japanese Vogue and appearances in Brighton Rock.) A full breakfast with tea, toast, extra hash browns and black pudding comes to a princely \u00a36.80. You'll struggle to finish it, even if you have just come off a building site. Plump properly porky sausages, decent (if slightly too salty) bacon and bright yellow eggs belie the low price.",

At this particular place of work, there was a lot of after work boozing going on, such that it did not seem to be ten minutes from stumbling out of the pub at past eleven, waking up and being on the way back to work in the morning with a thick head. A quick stop at the Regency to get fuelled up would help see me through the day, indeed several colleagues remarked that I was the paragon of effectiveness, all thanks to the Regency and despite the heavy nights. Eat in or take out. My favourite - bacon and egg butty, or sausage and egg butty, the sausage neatly sliced lengthways to ensure ease of consumption at one's desk. Eat in you can't beat the fry ups. Probably still the best cafe in Westminster.",

The Regency is decked out in its original Edwardian tiles, both inside and out, so that when the baritone voice of the lady who takes your order rings out to the kitchen staff, it echoes around the interior like a cavern. Its the normal satisfyingly greasy fare, all cooked and served in a classic fashion by the clean and proud-looking staff. Always busy, the clientele are a mixture of builders, suits and students, all tucking into their bacon rolls and egg'n'chips, knowing real quality when they see it. My only complaint is that the Regency is located too far from my Hackney home to visit more than occasionally, and that it's opening hours don't stretch to the evenings or weekends.",

The menu is pretty straight up: either tomatoes or beans with your full english breakfast or toast (I can't remember the other option) LOL but it was crazy good. You have to pay before you sit down which is good because it keeps non-eaters from occupying tables which eating patrons need. Plus, it ensures that queues are kept to a minimum. Will definitely visit this gem again when in town; btw, our visit was the 2nd week of Nov. 2017 for reference.",

They're perfectly fine for what they are, but they are what they are.Everything else, though? INCREDIBLE. Best in class (and even well above it).Update: My five stars are for breakfast. I've been back for dinner now, and it's solid but less spectacular diner fare. Come whenever you want: just order from the breakfast menu.",

Luckily, we were within walking of Regency and braved some stormy weather to trek over to the cafe. I ordered the eggs, sausage, tomatoes plate and it did not disappoint. It was so hearty that we didn't feel hungry till late in the evening (pretty much went from 8:00am to 6pm without eating -- only a couple cups of coffee to ward off the drowsiness).Lastly, I'd point out the economical value of the meal. After coffee and tea with our meal, the total was under \u00a315. For a city where an average meal is like a highway robbery, I'm glad a place like Regency exists.",

    "text": "So after years of knowing about the Regency Cafe, my best friend and I finally paid a visit.Things were definitely in full swing and a long queue snaked to the door when I entered at 8am. I joined the queue and thankfully this moved very quickly and before too long I was putting in my food order. There is a menu, but I think pretty much most people go for the standard English breakfast. If you are going to do this you have to take a few really tough decisions -Tea or coffee?Bread or toast?Tomato grilled or not?Once this is out of the way, it's plain sailing. Choose your seat and wait for your toast/bread order the surface and go back and grab that! Once our breakfasts surfaced, we tucked in. I've eaten a lot of full English breakfast in my time, but this has to rate very highly up there. It really was the perfect blend of just enough salt just enough grease without being too over the top. One of my biggest complaints with cafes, is that they use crappy ingredients to cut corners, but I was happy with all of the produce that they served here.As I visit more and more places around the world, I truly despair of the corporate homogenisation that is occurring throughout the globe. What happens when finally the only place to get coffee in the UK is a Starbucks, Costa or Cafe Nero? What happens when the only place to get lunch is a Macdonald's or a Pret? Even the small businesses that were once quirky, are now becoming more and more prevalent. Places like the Regency Cafe are the true gems that we have as they offer great value for money, individual style and friendly, if somewhat shouted service!",

Part of me feels obligated to rave and gush about it because it seems like a London institution, but I can't get on board with that 100%. You have to wait in line to order before you can sit down at a table. That's not a problem since the line moves at a tolerable rate. I think it contributes to control of their limited table space. There is certainly value in terms of the amount of food you get for the price. Coffee or tea, eggs, tomato or beans, sausage, bacon, and bread or toast. A massive plate of food! Maybe I'm just not accustomed to this hearty of a breakfast, but it just seemed extra greasy and extraordinarily heavily and nothing particularly special.",

Absolutely not.Why did I get yelled at, you ask? I made a huge mistake, I suppose. I ordered English breakfast with some toast, but I had no idea the toast doesn't come at the same time as the breakfast. When I went to pick up the breakfast platter, the guy who's dispatching the food asked if I also ordered a side of toast(furiously). Said yes, and he pushed the toast plate over and yelled \"I've been shouting for you to pick up your toast for the past 10 minutes!\". OK, I'm sorry that I didn't know every rule in this restaurant, but hey I brought cash, I waited in line patiently, I said to-maa-to instead of to-mae-to... I made an effort but that did not prevent me from getting scolded. I can understand how they are trying to maintain the quirky culture, the attitude is a part of the charm. But I just want to have a nice meal without hearing so much shouting in the background, and I'd prefer not getting yelled at. It's just not the place for me. Sad face.

I decided to get the homemade steak pie and chips. The man who took my order was very adamant that I should have vegetables - but from what I could tell, they really only have peas or beans, and I didn't want either. He was also insistent that I had gravy. I caved and said yes to the gravy, and he conceded that I could just have half gravy.We grabbed a table and about 5 minutes later, I heard the call of 'steak pie and chips for the young lady'. Young lady? Don't mind if I do, thanking you!So he was right, it was nice with the gravy. And half gravy meant that my delicious chips weren't made all soggy by a ladle of gravy. The steak pie is the only pie they make on-site, and it's really nice - the meat is tender and there aren't any fatty bits. It's pretty plain, with the filling being some sort of tomato-based sauce (American readers, it reminded me of swiss steak). It was a solid choice!So yes, for the caf\u00e9 it is, it's a 5*. Charming service, quality food, and at a good price.",

It comes with tea or coffee, and bread or toast.After you order, you find a seat and wait for your order to be called out.After reading reviews I was worried about the apparent rudeness of this guy, but honestly, I think he's great!He remembered my name the second time I visited, and was joking around with me.The food itself is brilliant.It's the kind of food you just want to eat while curled up in a blanket watching TV.Will definitely return without a shadow of a doubt the next time I'm in London.",

The staff is rude, and they literally yell at you. The food is standard at best, the setting and the decor are lacking, and there isn't a moment's peace, because the whole time there's a staff member yelling out orders at the top of their lungs for people to come and pick up their food. If I were in the military, or in prison, I imagine it'd be something like that. Just absolutely not worth going to, at all.",

Oh and listen for your name, do not make the cashier angry by having to call it multiple times.The breakfast is hearty and arrives quickly, I went for a full English, with beans, toast and tea, with added extras of bubble and squeak, black pudding and hash browns. To be honest the bubble and squeak didn't do anything for me, but the pudding and hash browns really hit the spot. Eggs were cooked with proper runny yolks and the rest of the plate was went down a treat. The idea here is to get in, eat and get out, it's not fine dining, nor are you entitled to keep your table for ages. As greasy spoons go, it's good, but unfortunately a little too far for me to go for breakfast on a normal occasion.",

I'm glad I chose the Regency Cafe (near Pimlico station) instead.The set breakfast goes for \u00a35.50: egg, sausage, bacon, beans or tomato, toast or bread, and coffee or tea. You can add extras like hash browns or black pudding for 90p each. You'll likely have to queue up at the counter, place your order, grab your own utensils and find a seat amongst the suits and construction workers, then listen for your order to be called. There are specials throughout the week: shepherd's pie on Tuesdays, curry on Wednesdays, and fish & chips on Fridays, for example. There's quite a selection of other dishes as well. The cafe feels like its stuck in another time--nothing seems to have changed in decades, and that gives it a certain charm. While you wait, have a look at the photos on the walls showing the cafe throughout its history.The food was exactly what you'd expect in a full English. Everything was tasty, and it was served up remarkably fast. I will say that the fried egg looked somewhat plastic-like, although its appearance belies its taste, and that the bacon was rather on the salty side. Certainly worth a visit.",

Good god did we leave happy. It's a super casual spot, but you'll see a wide array of clientele, including guys in suits and guys in construction hats. The food is impeccable and crazy reasonably priced considering how expensive food can be in London. We had the traditional english breakfast, with tomatoes, hash browns, mushrooms, basically everything extra you could get. We also got the special of the day, shepard's pie, which I couldn't resist even though it was breakfast time. I dream about this place and am devastated that I can't hit it up every Sunday morning.

I live in the area and only get to go at weekends but from what i've experienced the food is great, especially if you've dragged yourself there with a hangover. In fact i reckon it's the best place for a decent brekkie in the area!The decor doesn't try to be 'retro' or kitsch' - this stuff is originall! The cafe is so visually striking it has also starred in Layer Cake and a VW ad.",

This filled me up and next time I am in Regency Street, I will definitely try some of their other meals as well. They looked really nice",

    "text": "\"CHICKEN, CHIPS & PEAS\" This is a fantastic British cafe. \u00a0I'd call it an old school diner myself. \u00a0Lots of charm to this joint that looks as if it's been transported from a movie set with actors included. \u00a0You can call it Edwardian but I don't know what the heck that means. \u00a0Wait in line, head to the counter and place your order. \u00a0Mostly diner type food; burgers, pastas, omlettes, roasted chicken and everybody is having chips (fries to all you stateside wankers). \u00a0When your order is ready the same guy who took your order yells out whats ready in a booming baritone voice. \u00a0CHICKEN, CHIPS & PEAS. \u00a0Great stuff.I think some of the locals were pissed because I was sitting down before ordering my food, a supposed no-no. \u00a0Damn Yankees. \u00a0Once I got my chicken, chips and peas I realized why the place was so damn packed. \u00a0A line was there when we arrived and the line was still going strong when we left. \u00a0The chicken was crisp yet moist and tender inside, covered in a nice pan gravy. \u00a0The chips aren't your daddy's french fries, they're more like roasted crispy potatoes. \u00a0If you've eaten proper chips you know what I mean. \u00a0The gravy had a sheen and tasted home made. \u00a0I gooped up every last drop on the chicken, the chips and the peas. \u00a0Proper British food to start off my all British day. \u00a0Go you Irons!!!",

Other reviews have captured the atmosphere better than I can after just one visit - but I will be coming back here every time I'm in London, I guarantee it. The shepherds pie was good but the Cornish pasty was absolutely to die for. Good pastries, too.",

    "text": "Vintage formica. Love it. Great atmosphere and NOT a tourist joint - mostly locals and tradesmen (plumbers, gas fitters, etc) getting fuelled up in the morning. You should see the number of small vans parked outside in the morning! All the more reason for tourists to come and check out a genuine piece of London in the heart of Westminster. Bacon sandwiches are made wth slices of bloomer bread i.e. not a factory square loaf and bring your false teeth if you wear one because the bloomer bread is lovely and chewy. I still cannot get over watching people order and eat chips with their fry up breakfasts in the morning (before 10am)!!!! Queues at lunch time are long and a testament to the Regency's popularity. Check out their displayed boxing and football memorabilia too.",

    "text": "I'm happy to report that the Great British Greasy Spoon is alive and well in Westminster. The Regency Cafe is certainly no secret, with a queue that stretched out of the door for the duration of my visit. Inside, tiled walls are decorated with movie memorabilia (although strangely no mention of Layer Cake) and the noise is almost deafening. What at first appears to be total bedlam is, in fact, an amazingly well organised operation. \"How does this work?\" enquires an American lady, \"What do I do if there are no seats available when my food is ready?\", \"Don't worry, there are always seats ready\" is the confident reply from the waiter. He was right. Quite how this places works so well I can't quite fathom, but work it does. At the counter a diminutive lady shouts out orders so loud that I can't hear myself think. Well cooked, hearty grub flies out of the kitchens to feed the queuing hordes. The Regency Cafe is a real find, and I loved it. I suggest you try it too - there will always be a seat for you.",
