Utter delicious carnage. Greeted with a glass of champagne that was regularly filled (naughty!), I perused the delights of the deli upstairs then mooched down to the kitchen for hefty canapes such as freshly battered fish and chunky chips, chicken satay, sausages with a piquant sauce, and focaccia burgers! Super tasty and exactly what I needed. Especially after one of their spiced apple rum punches with earl grey tea foam - it's fresh taste certainly belied it's kick! The space itself is HUGE (did I mention that already?) and there's plenty of benches and tables upstairs and a very long bar so your hopes of getting served at speed by their friendly and very attractive bar staff are very high! I like. I like even more the more cosy space downstairs, replete with high backed comfy chairs with round tables for a good old natter over cocktails with friends. But more than that, they have great (quality and quantity) ladies toilets. Perfect, they smelled divine as I walked in and the walls were a soft velvet. For a lady, there is really nothing better than a good quality, spacious, CLEAN, fresh smelling toilet - the dives i've been too with wet floors and queues to rival your filthiest festival would curdle your milk! The Folly is a misnomer to say the least, this is certainly no foolish or \"costly ornamental building with no practical purpose\". it's the perfect lunchtime/after work meeting place.",

We had the service charge removed from our bill but service didn't improve with single drink orders taking another 15-20 minutes when there was noone at the bar (plus service charge).

The reception lady booked the area right to the entrance on ground floor as I requested (my 1st preference was semi-private room on the right but it was already booked). We pre-ordered food and drinks days before. But on the day at arrival, we were told our preferred area wasn't booked as they never locate a specific area at time of booking (clearly self-contradictory vs semi-private room booking) and the only available area was the very inside corner downstairs. It is a dark hot and very noisy (next to speaker) / worst corner! What's more, we were told our pre-order wasn't received and we will have to wait for 1 hour for the new order served. All these totally spoiled the celebration spirit and some colleagues have to leave hungrily as they cannot stay long. It is extremely disappointed esp. considering we have been looking forward to this celebration drink for whole week's hard work! Will never ever come here again.",

Contemporary.But I came on a Friday night at 10pm, having already got drunk at a pub in Canary Wharf and not really realising or caring what I was going to be in for once my colleagues steered me toward a bar in the City.It was dire. And I couldn't even see the decor amidst the crowd.Think alcohol-fuelled sexual desperation of miscellaneous City colleagues playing out all around you. Think awkward impromptu pockets of dance parties around handbags. Think expensive and unimpressive drinks.But you'd get this at any City bar at 10pm on a Friday night, so I'd be unfair in giving it two stars. The toilets were like a tree house. I'll give an extra star for that.And there you go. That was my experience.",

On one hand, this looks like a cute foodie outpost of an Anthropolgie (and likely a sister restaurant to the Anthologist) with a Sunday roast that could feed an army for a reasonable price but on the other it has service that rivals molasses that's been in a freezer next to Han Solo after that carbonite incident. If you've got a lot of time on your hands though, the food is worth the wait and is served with a bit of flair to match the surroundings. The roasts are served family-style, so you'll need to bring a friend to take advantage of the big roasting pans filled with veggies and meat. To be fair, I'll still probably recommend the place but some elements shine brighter than others.",

You feel cozy at the Folly. There's a little boutique in the corner that is very cute. So there's clearly some magic in the air, but it quickly fades away once the very poor service and average food kicks in. Very sad.I wouldn't recommend for a meal. We tried it for a sunday lunch, and we had mixed feelings. The service was hectic, slow and kinda random despite very few customers there for lunch.Food is similarly disappointing. The burger is served on a tiny wooden board, between 2 very (very) thick pieces of chewy bread. The parmesan/rosemary chips were super greasy and the strawberry cheesecake is a cocktail but listed in the dessert section. To be fair, some of my friends likes their meal. The linguine and the chicken/pasta salad seemed nice - except for the presentation: why would you serve the salad in a take away box?The cocktails were great. The barman is clearly a clever guy.All in all, a little disappointed. Mixed feelings about the whole thing. I'll probably go back and give it a second try. Maybe I was just unlucky and it would be better suited for a relaxed dinner evening :)",

High ceilings, fun decor and casual communal table with benches. I was finally there for a goodbye drink last night. And I was duly disappointed, no so much of the place or the drink but of the services. I waited literally for over 15 minutes just to get a drink and the bar wasn't that busy. There were quite a few barmen behind, but for some reason, they won't take my order and I had to wait for the guy who was taking forever to make two cocktails. The drinks are relatively cheap here if you can get someone to pour one for you. I am not going back for sure.",

With flower pots as light fixtures and gorgeous colorful prints throughout this place is stellar. And the bathroom? Amazing. Seriously. Check it out if you go.We came here for the Sunday roast after it was recommended to us. We were warned that the service was slow so be prepared to wait. So I figured I would book a table for noon, the time they started serving roast. We arrived a bit early but we were quickly seated with a smile. When the server came over he was really timid and almost intimidated by us and it kind of made the whole exchange awkward. He didn't know when the roast would start being served and after finding out when he failed to give us the menu so we could at least put in our orders. Oh well. I did order a coffee and a pastry to snack until it was time to order lunch. When my coffee arrived it was lukewarm. I'll forgive you a lot of things but not shitty coffee. After we had our snack I got the server's attention and we got to order our lunch. They serve the food family style and a minimum of 2 people have to order one of three choices. We went with the roasted chicken. Our food came out fast (was it because we were there early? was it because the place was better staffed? who knows but I say 'yay!') and we dug in fast. Sadly the chicken was dry but thankfully we had gravy so that saved it. But the roasted potatoes and leeks were FIVE star. Seriously. Best roasted potatoes I've had in a long time. And the leeks were cooked in butter. And we all know butter is good for you, right?We left with very full bellies. My husband was only disappointed with the dry chicken and I was still cranky about my warm coffee. A second visit is necessary before I can give it the 4 stars I think it's sooo close to deserving.",

The food, when it FINALLY did arrive, was very very good. I had the pork belly roast and stuffed myself past the point of full. At \u00a312.95, it was slightly less than the average roast and had a LOAD of food. I heard the beef roast was also good, but the fish and chips quite oily.Really, If I had loads of time, I may come back here for a roast, but seriously the waitstaff are a bit scaterbrained and distracted; It took nearly 20 minutes to get a green tea...What, did you go all the way to China for it?So...yeah.

    "text": "Been meaning to visit here ever since I saw the building work going on a few months back. Finally got the chance last night when I met a friend in the Bank area and we needed a bar that did food. First impression is a 'wow' at the size of it - it has a couple of floors and tons of space for drinking and eating. The decor is 'fresh' lots of wood and green colours def. has a garden feel about it. We headed for the basement bar as the tables with big comfy chairs looked cosy enough to stay all night in. Once in the bar we spotted a large private dining room (didn't get a chance to ask if there is a fee/minimum spend for using), but one to keep in view!. We ordered food from the bar (I believe it's table service upstairs). I had a crispy duck salad, which was superb - a generous amout of duck and tasty sauce, great value at \u00a38.50. My friend went for the fish pie which she said had loads of good quality fish in it. My friend also commented that the ladies toilets were really nice, when I went in there I agreed, lots of cubicles, space for make up and nice soaps/hand creams. I met another lady in there who claimed 'these toilets are fabulous!' how many times do people say that?! We did have a little hiccup though, when a waiter cleared our plates he knock over our bottle of wine. Despite losing most of the bottle, and it covering one of my trouser legs and my new coat, when I asked for replacement wine he refused. I kept asking (eventually asking to see a manager) but didn't get anywhere. It was an accident but still, that was \u00a315 worth of wine!. I eventually caught a manager walking past and explained what happened. He offered to pay for the dry cleaning on my coat (but I wasn't too worried about it) I asked him to replace our wine and he immediately brought over another bottle so we were more than happy with that. I think the poor waiter was worried he would get in trouble but accidents do happen. Overall we had a really great evening. We could hear a DJ playing upstairs so I think we will be back for dance! One last thing, my friend was reading 'Stylist' magazine in the bar and they actually had a half page review of the Folly bar in there, so if its good enough for them... Recommended for dates, groups of friends and work events.",

It is an amazing bar, you feel a million miles away from the hustle and bustle outside, the huge windows allow a huge view and open feeling.The decor is very modern and chic its very well done, everything flows and works well. The stye is spot-on and the atmosphere is friendly and lively without being too cool. The crowd is mostly young.The drinks list is very good with skinny cocktails so perfect for a guilt free drink or two. The food menu is nice too more for nibbles than a posh meal.",

I called twice and The Folly messed up my booking twice. We ended up sitting in the waiting area, which is lovely for waiting (comfy seats) but horrible for eating (low tables). The food was very 'meh'. The ambiance was also 'meh'. It feels too spacious and oddly arranged, so you never really feel comfortable at The Folly. A friend of mine went to The Folly for drinks and liked it, so maybe that's what it's good for...",

The \"Roman\" chips where meant to have Parmesan and truffle oil on it ... Both were only visible if you bring a microscope. In top if that my burger was basically burnt to a crisp ... And that's from someone who normally likes a medium burger. My friend was complaining that her flatbread was as try as shortbread.

Meanwhile they were upstairs at a different table and HAD arrived. I was told they had come in a different entrance. Not really a good excuse when its my lunchour and I'm wasting time.The food was cold-ish. Nothing was piping hot and it seemed like it had been sitting around. Poor.The sauces took ages to come/never came, and were served in mincule saucers. they need bottles, badly.The lunch food didnt taste great. Quite bland even.The evening niblles I had whilst have after work drinks were better - very hot, and much more tasty.Serving sizes were small, considering the prices.Good Points:Everything looks amazing, from the decor, to the presentation of the food, even the staff were presentable and bright eyed.the pop-up boutique is so cool, and the florist is stylish too.Its going to be a drinks only venue from now on I think....But I'll still come here because it is local and very beautiful.",

    "text": "Stepping into The Folly is almost like being in Meatpacking District in New York, with the large space and high ceelings. If you are looking for a place with a bar, restaurant and also somewhere you can dance later then this is the spot for you. Although during a weekend night you can not be sensitive to really loud volume from both the music and the crowds of people when you are eating. A cosy dinner for two - forget it. But to start the evening with some friends, then it\u00b4s a cool place. I like the different areas in the restaurant - one part looking like a kitchen, another like an outdoor garden with lamps in the trees and the third larger part is in an open space. Downstairs is almost the same area with a bar and tables, dance-friendly on a Friday night. (speak-friendly ... well, if you don\u00b4t mind shouting). :) When it comes to the food it\u00b4s hard to review as I \"only\" had the Salad Nicoise, but it was really great and I just loved the mustard sauce to it. Never had that combination before and the strong mustard was so great to the tuna. The tuna pices were perfect as well, medium fried (not to dry). The only thing I would have wished for was Champagne on the glass. Now they only had cava on glass and Champagne on a bottle. In Sweden (where I come from) and also in New York all restaurants offer a glass of champagne.",

It was fairly empty down there when we arrived, and we got a nice table with arm chairs - the chairs and table were just the right height and it was surprisingly comfy to eat in them. The decor is right up my alley (so to speak), quite eclectic and playful. There are lots of different styles, but all work really well together. My favourite bit was the girls' bathroom. It was vast! It had a huge amount of cubicles, an interesting trough-like wash basin and even trees growing in there! The wallpaper is velvet and so tactile (Although I wonder who else has been touching in in the loo!) and there is plenty of room for mirror and gossip time. We did have lunch there, and it was perfectly decent. My friend had the fish pie and I had the duck salad. Both were very generous portions and neither of us left in any way hungry! The service was lovely, but sporadic because it seemed they were short-staffed. We had to flag down waiters and waitresses who were really running about and not wearing a discernible uniform (embarrassingly this meant we accidentally flagged down a random customer instead, twice!) They hunted about and found us a blackberry phone charger, but took about 10 minutes to bring tabasco sauce. I would definitely go back here again, and I suspect that it may be even better on a Thursday night.",

The friendly service however encouraged me into a false sense of security that perhaps he mains would be better. Wrong. The fish and chips (as I said before) looks fantastic - however the heavy/under cooked batter masked any taste of fish. There was no seasoning used on any dish which left me with an unpleasant heavy oil slicked mouth and light wallet for the pleasure. We were genuinely disappointed.

The service was fabulous (even walked away with some suggestions for other great places), the clientele was cool (chatted with a few locals), and the ambiance was just what I like. Modern and open but still somehow cozy.I ordered the pork belly roast, which came with au jus, stewed carrots and red cabbage, also a small side of lemony dessert, which was delicious. This was also my first time having Yorkshire Pudding, which was flaky and delicious and I sopped up a lot of the juices with it. Also had one of the special cocktails (something with spiced rum, spices, coffee, and kahlua), and it blew my mind. Super spicy and super tasty. I ate everything they set in front of me, even the big knicker-bocker glory that this Harry Potter fan was simply unable to pass up (remember Dudley having one at the zoo?). Prices were appropriate.When I go back to London, I will definitely be having Sunday Roast at The Folly, and I recommend that you go too.",

The cocktails are always good and a bottle of wine is reasonably priced.I love the decor in here and, if you ignore the fact that every branch of this place looks the same, it can almost feel original...The Folly is enormous.

They have a very nice system going. The reason I give the folly 5 full stars on because our waiter was such a nice guy. Though he was absolutely swamped, he was still very friendly and cared about what we thought of our food. The food itself was also extremely good. Though I don't usually go to bars, I would definitely come here after work with some friends to unwind. Well done!",

    "text": "I like The Folly comparatively to your other choices in the city. It's got great eclectic decor, and a decent cocktail list (big fan of the skinny mango mojito). It's almost always absolutely rammed in the evenings - and downstairs can get pretty rowdy. With large crowds of suited men prowling the landscape for ladies (yes, it's a total meat market), it sometimes can smell pretty unfresh down there. But don't let that deter you, this place is fun. I've eaten here a couple of times (you should call and make a reservation, as it's very busy Thursdays and Friday especially). The food is a-ok, the Christmas meal I had here was lacklustre, but the other time with the main menu was decent enough - good burgers and sweet potato fries in particular. Oh, and surprisingly decent bread. Overall, i prefer The Folly's sister bar, The Anthologist (at Bank) - it's the original and the best. However, The Folly is a great place to kick back in the city of London and have some after work drinks in a busy spot.",

When you order a burger, and they don't ask you how you like it cooked, just change your order to something else. The burger here looks good with its tall stature and brioche bun but, upon closer inspection, the meat patties have that preformed frozen from the factory look. You know, that machine formed hockey puck like hard edge (not ground or hand formed on prem). And it tastes like it. They cooked the thing well done and it was dry and tasteless. The fries that come with the burger were underdone and not crispy enough around the edges. When you have thick steak fries, there is little chance of the center drying out, so why not cook it a bit longer?",

I took a visiting friend here because the decor and space is just so damned great, very rustic cottage chic (pretty much an anthropologie show room).We ordered from the apps-to-share portion of the menu, which range from 5.95 to 7.95 a dish. We got the \"prawn lollipops\" (which is a cringe-worthy name, just call em fried prawn skewers, cause that's what they were). and those were fairly tasty and fresh. My issue was with the duck pancake which were served in deplorably, obviously been sitting out a while state.The pancakes had hard edges and were cold, the shredded duck meat was greasy/filmy, room temp and getting it's own layer of crust. the hoisin was way too thick and forming a skin like old gravy. seriously? taking into account my previous review (and another reviewer's same issue with their steak), they clearly have an issue with expediting/running food in as its ready. i'm not going to keep coming back to pay out the nose for food that gets served in that state.",

It's a big space but broken up well into smaller areas, and that's before you realise how big it is downstairs. We had a couple of drinks, ventured out to see the fireworks for the Lord Mayors parade then, as we don't know the area well and it was still raining hard, headed back to get something to eat.The staff are friendly and the menu interesting. They have a good range of drinks as well so on that front it's all good.We both ordered the Fish & Scampi main course, and it arrived pretty promptly. I was hungry so tentatively forked a couple of chips, blew on them and shoved them in my gob! It was then I realised they weren't all that hot. The food wasn't cold but it didn't seem to be all that fresh either.My guess is the chips were under a heater, and the fish/scampi was re-deep fried at the last minute.That said, it was a nice combo, scampi, chunks of haddock and salmon, with a sauce that wasn't tartare but... well I'm not sure what it was (chive and onion?) but it was tasty enough.Not somewhere I'd choose to visit again I don't think. And whilst it was very loud, down to both the music and the number of people all shouting to make themselves heard, it did seem to be quieter than it seemed, clever acoustics?All in all a pretty standard pub that happened to be en route. Next time we'll look further afield (depending on the rain...)",

It's also a really cool space with lots of little nooks and crannies and it's great for people watching.Sadly it seems to be all about style over substance when it comes to the food. While everything looked good the taste was very much lacking. I was served easily the worst chicken satay I've ever had and the fish and chips was lacking in seasoning and the batter was undercooked and very greasy.

    "text": "Great service and a detailed d\u00e9cor does not save this place from getting two stars.I visited The Folly for a birthday dinner and had the Beef & Reef for main course since it was promoted as a special \u00a315 deal. It included half a lobster, steak & chips and a glass of bubbly (or another drink). Not bad a premise but that's where the compliments end: the half a lobster should actually be called \"two bites and you are done\" and the same can be said about the steak. Furthermore, the meat was tasteless, hard and charred. Even the chips were a disappointment; they were either waiting for a while before being brought to the table or, worse, they were cooked beforehand and simply heated. How can you go wrong with chips? I suppose that if something sounds to good to be true...The cr\u00e8me burlee was equally disappointing and for a meal that came just short of \u00a325 I would have expected much better.Despite the great decoration that aims to recreate a \"secret garden\" environment (the bathrooms are actually quite cool) and retains some interesting pieces of d\u00e9cor (the feather chandelier to name one) , I don't agree with some reviews mentioning it has great \"ambiance\". It doesn't. It's ironic that their website promises a \"calm place\" and yet the volume of the music is loud to the point that you can hardly hear the person next to you. I would never host a client dinner here.5 stars to the service though. Polite, fast and took the initiative of bringing a cr\u00e8me burlee with a candle to the table so that we could sing happy birthday to our friend. A nice little touch indeed...Food was a disappointment and it's clearly overpriced. I won't come back for more.",

Not necessarily mind-blowing stuff from a culinary perspective, but nevertheless upscale-looking contemporary bistro fare, whether Belgian mussels, Thai coconut curry, or a savory, delightfully juicy Wagyu beef burger. Service is friendly and professional, and the ambience manages to be both social and intimate. Folks didn't hold back from being intimate while on dates, despite the communal seating.

    "text": "Dining at the Folly have been a very mixed experience. The restaurant itself is lovely. beautiful interior, cozy atmosphere and very clean. On the other hand, the food and staff is a whole other talk.**The restaurant**Getting to the restaurant is very easy, just a few minutes walk from Bank st. The inside of the restaurant is absolutely stunning, with plants hanging from the ceiling, and the dimmed lights create a very cozy and relaxed atmosphere. Some people have mentioned that the music is too loud and while I personally didn't mind, I understand that some people might find the volume too high, which might make it very difficult to have a conversation with someone.**The food**There's a lot of different dishes on the menu, which accommodates most people. There's a problem, though, when it comes to special dietary requirements and allergies. One of my guests is vegan and celiac, so we both tried to contact the restaurant in advance to make sure she could actually eat something. We never heard back from them even though we called them, filled out the form on their website(which says they'll get back to you within 48 hours), emailed them and sent them a message on messenger(which they saw but for some reason chose not to reply to). I did also specify this when making the reservation, but it didn't seem like they even read the message. Based on what me and my guests ordered, I would say the restaurant is more suitable for omnivores. Although, the people who ordered the vegan risotto said it was very good. My vegetarian dish was very tasty, but it's not very enjoyable to eat jerusalem artichokes when some parts still aren't fully cooked and the roots still are left.**The staff**From my experience before and during the dinner, it seems like the staff doesn't really want to have anything to do with things that might make the cooking and service complicated. I really don't believe it's a coincidence that we never heard back from them after trying to get in contact with them for almost 3 weeks, and if it isn't then it's absolutely impossible to get in contact with the restaurant whatsoever.When my guest asked the waiter if the glutenfree bread was vegan(most glutenfree bread contains eggs) he simple replied with \"madame! I can asure you it's glutenfree\", even though she phrased the question in multiple ways.If we just kept our mouths shut the waiter was very nice, but if we was being just a tying bit difficult he would start to get annoyed.I would definitely recommend dining at the Folly if you don't have any allergens or dietary requirements, but if you and you don't find the menu clear enough, I wouldn't bother coming for dinner.",

We ordered the same drink - homemade lemonade - but one tasted very watery and the other had a dark unidentifiable object floating about. \u00a0 The first was replaced, tasting less watery but with another floating object, and was replaced for a second time. I had the salmon special. It arrived quickly and \u00a0was beautifully presented but pretty tasteless (I felt the need to add salt to flavour, but resisted). The cheeseburger was also very good, and onion rings tasted great. Be careful ordering drinks.

It took ages for anyone to come over and take our order. In fact, we had to ask a guy to come take our order. There was 3 of us, we got a duck flatbread to share to start. The duck was nice but the rest wasn't really. The bread wasn't quite right and the vegetables had no flavour. For mains, the boys both got a steak with peppercorn sauce & chips. I got fish and chips. The boys were both satisfied with their meals, and I was too but the batter could have used a little longer in the fryer. It was a little doughy in the middle. The fish itself was great though. With 4 beers and 2 virgin cocktails it all came to about \u00a3100.",

    "text": "I was recently in London on vacation and decided to stop in and visit some English colleagues of mine who work nearby. They picked the Folly because it is one of their usual lunch spots. When you walk in you'll notice that the decor is pretty rustic and fresh which was very cool. We had stepped out pretty early for lunch so when we arrived there wasn't much of a wait. We were led to a communal high top table and our server came by right away. We ordered waters, cokes, etc. and had a chance to look at the menu. Everything sounded very good and I wasn't shocked by the prices at all. Having spent quite a bit of time in London before I was anticipating some higher prices right in the heart of the business district but that wasn't the case at all. You would find similar prices in most big cities at sit down restaurants. I settled on the Chicken BLT sandwich with chips.The food arrived quickly and it looked good. The chicken was well cooked and just the right amount of food for lunch. Coming from the US I often see enormous lunch time portions so it was refreshing to see a proper proportion of food. I'll be honest though...the chips were my favorite part. I love English chips! My colleagues told me that The Folly was a popular wine bar after work and after looking at the wine menu I'm sure I would agree. Would I return? Yes, for sure! The food was good, the location is good, the ambiance is good. An all round good experience! I just wish I hadn't worn jeans to meet up my colleagues as they were all dressed in suits. Part of the insurance crowd.",

    "text": "Our hotel concierge recommended Folly as an easy brunch spot. At first glance the place is gorgeous, large, charming with lots of mixed electric decor. There were several baby carriages on the top seating area, which seemed a great spot for parents, however the whole restaurant smelled like dirty baby diapers..We rolled up around 12:00/12:30? and brunch was just about to end. We had to order fast, and I didn't really have a chance to see the full selection. I ended up with one piece of avocado toast, with a tiny egg on top, and chili flakes. I was starving and expected a lot more food - a couple eggs with toast, and avocado smothered in chili.. Cultural differences lesson #1, you are not in Brooklyn anymore smaller proportions. Chili on a British menu might equal chili flakes. I also had a very blah mango smoothie. The whole thing made me feel sick.My fianc\u00e9 got a full English breakfast and it made him ill to the point he had to run back to the hotel halfway there :(. I felt ill as well. Maybe it was because we were delirious from our overnight flight? Sadly service was not great either - our bill needed fixing twice. I would give it another go though, certainly has potential perhaps at a different time of day.",

    "text": "Mixed feelings about The Folly. \u00a0Located close to our office building, we had a team dinner while several of us were visiting London from the US. \u00a0It's got a great vibe, and we were seated immediately when we arrived on time for our reservation. \u00a0We were seated at a long picnic table with long benches. \u00a0Three of us had to pull the bench out and then find a way to gracefully get ourselves seated on this bench while wearing dresses. \u00a0We ordered drinks and it took a while for them to arrive. \u00a0We had a mix up with one of my co-workers, every type of wine she ordered was not available. \u00a0Finally they found one she was happy with and then left the whole bottle even though she only wanted a glass. \u00a0It took 10 minutes before someone came back and we could get the error corrected.We ordered main dishes and sides and everything was delicious. \u00a0I ordered fish and chips and a beetroot salad (I don't like mushy peas). \u00a0Fish and chips were great and the beetroot salad was amazing. \u00a0A few of us ordered desserts and we had an issue with the apple tarts. \u00a0Three of us ordered the same thing. \u00a0Only one came out properly cooked, the second was slightly burnt and the third was inedible. \u00a0It was a production finding our server and getting it taken away. \u00a0I really could not believe they served them that way. \u00a0Before we had finished desserts, a man came over and informed us that we would have to leave immediately, as they needed our table for someone else. \u00a0He said we should have been told when we arrived that we had a time limit (we were not told that). \u00a0We had not even been given the bill yet, but he stared at us uncomfortably from across the room as though we were disobeying his order. \u00a0Our bill finally came and it was wrong. \u00a0They made an attempt to correct it and it was still wrong. \u00a0A replacement dessert was brought for the burnt apple tart but then we had to ask for it for take away as we were not being allowed to stay at the table. \u00a0The server did not seem to understand that which led to more confusion and more time. \u00a0On the third attempt the bill was finally correct and we were able to pay, but my co-worker who was paying said she wanted the service charge to be removed. \u00a0That led to a series of questions, but she finally agreed to remove the charge.The food was good and the company was wonderful, but the experience overall was tainted by the service and the attitudes of the staff.",

Crammed in like sardines. \u00a0Full of the type of people I usually want to slap across the face.There is little redeeming about this place. It was so loud that even once our group did find each other, the shouting to a person a shoulder's width away left most of us with gravelly voices the next day. \u00a0My ears were ringing the next morning as if I'd been at some sort of great music gig. \u00a0Except it was just 2 hours in a horrible City bar. \u00a0I was drinking soft drinks. \u00a0Each round seemed to come in a smaller glass than the last. \u00a0Never the same shape or size. \u00a0Yet, when a member of our party ordered a Jack & Coke, it came in a pint glass. What sort of logic is that?The handful of guys who were picking up glasses were like vultures, constantly circling and pushing through groups and conversations. \u00a0Any time I sat my glass on the countertop, a glass collector was there. \u00a0Of course, only rarely was the glass emptied. \u00a0Some people do just like to use a table or counter to rest their glass as they speak. Add to this that the vulture-like glass guys were incredibly rude. It was just one more thing to make this place pretty much the worst London bar I've been in. \u00a0And that's saying something. Trying to push your way through the crowds to the restrooms was hilarious. \u00a0Drunk, dancing, barely clothed girls falling over besuited City dude bros and blocking the way through the downstairs was at least something vaguely entertaining to see. \u00a0At least the bathrooms were clean. \u00a0And quiet. A few minutes' respite was appreciated as I probably washed my hands well enough to go into surgery. Danger, Will Robinson. Just save yourself sticky shoes and a headache and go anywhere else.",

    "text": "You will struggle to pay me enough to ever visit this place again. Possibly the least fun bar experience I've had in years, anywhere.Someone in our group of friends had the bright idea to meet up here; and without any experience I had no reason to disagree. Now I do. We were expecting 10 or so of us throughout the evening; but we'd be lucky if you could fit 3 of us next to each other for any kind of conversation at any point. Yes, it was a Friday night, but the place is absolutely huge both upstairs and downstairs and yet is inexplicably the most popular place in the City, by the look of things.I said you could fit 3 in a tight circle for a conversation, but that's not entirely true: there's little hope of being able to have a conversation. The music (an, obnoxious, repetitive, utterly pointless dance/club interpretation of the subject) was surrounding both floors with a multitude of speakers all turned up to \"maximum ear pain\". We couldn't hear anything but the music. Except maybe for other, larger groups of greasy suited city workers, shouting to hear their own conversations. I do not understand what makes a bar turn the music up to the point that the patrons can't talk to one another. Is that not what a bar is meant for? Atmosphere can be achieved through background music (if at all) and the general buzz of a busy bar.Elsewhere, such as on the way to the bar, or on the way to the bathroom, people were trying to dance to this music. There was no room to do so, so it was just obnoxious drink-swinging, spilling stuff all over the place, or awkward rubbing up against strangers just trying to get by. If you want people to dance, make a dance floor (NOT in the bathroom hallway) and put the music up there only.If you find yourself in here, you have to ask what you want from the evening. Do you want to talk? It's too loud. Do you want to dance? It's too busy. Do you want to eat? Well, I don't know how good the restaurant section is, but the food must be insanely amazing for the diners to put up with not being able to hear their date/friends. Do you want a fine selection of beers and spirits? Well, they have, erm, Peroni, if you ever make it to the bar...Really, there is very little to do in here except stand in a crush with the post-work crowd and watch each other drink lager or pinot.",
