All were great although the amount of chicken per person vastly exceeded what you get with the beef and the pork. The kale and carrots that came with each were also very nice. I couldn't eat any of the potatoes as I'm not a massive potato fan and I was too full of chicken. We had a bottle of the house wine (its branded as the Albion's own house wine) which was tasty and reasonably priced at \u00a316",

We originally had a reservation for 5 people at 8pm on a Friday night, and had to change it to 4 at 9pm, but they were very gracious about it and it wasn't a problem at all (which was much appreciated since I was expecting to be treated like an annoying tourist).I had a smashed pea/broad bean & crumbled goat cheese crostini to start with, and a rump steak with garlic butter. Both were fantastic. Everyone else loved their food as well--the lamb, grilled fish, and desserts were all excellent. If I lived in London I'd come here often, but I'll at least make it a point to come back the next time I'm there.",

    "text": "Gastropub, as I've long said to anyone who'll listen - and shouted at anyone who won't - is a word of two halves. Er, Brian. There's equal emphasis, therefore, on the gastro element and the pub bit. Simple no? But amazing how many get it wrong. The Albion, while flawed, does at least get the balance right. If you want to eat, the food is great. If you want to drink, the ambience is proper, smart pub. Having paid \u00a34+ for Leffe in many spots and with \u00a33.50 being a pretty standard pint price these days, I don't really understand that gripe but I'm with Sir Eamon of Qype in terms of speed. Service here can be a little intermittent, he says, politely. But, while the timing of wine and meal in that instance is completely unforgivable, having to wait a few minutes longer than anticipated for an excellent half dozen oysters and a very good, nicely herbed fish pie isn't a terrible price, particularly when the Black Sheep is kept this well. If you're looking for a boozer, head elsewhere. If you're thinking of nestling in for a few hours for a very pleasant culinary and boozy experience, I'd rather be here than anywhere else in the area.",

As for dessert, I'm not telling the dentist - I naturally went for the sticky toffee pudding with extra sauce as I wasn't having the icecream.

When my husband went back to query it, the barman, in total silence pulled the receipt from the till and handed it to my husband. When my husband sat down, I could see the barman looking at us and sniggering to another barman. Leffe is my drink, as is my husband bitter, we never pay these sort of prices, not even in the West End. Are they charging these prices because of the surrounding area and taking advantage of it? Me thinks they have delusions of grandeur! Would never go back on principal. One little positive, there was a guy there that appeared to be some sort of manager, he was very sweet and seemed very helpful.",

But a change of management and make-over a few years ago has left this place short of average. The light blue decor appears cold, and the overall look reminds one more of Scandinavia than a good local English pub. Just like the interior, the food appears to be all style over substance, as portion sizes are very small and prices are high. The biggest shock, however, was the presence of bouncers one Sunday lunchtime, who politely told us that there were no tables free and that we would have to wait outside until one became available \u00a0management certainly doesn't want pub customers to stand up here! It is such a shame to have seen the changes made to this place, especially since the garden at the back and seating in front are definitely worth enjoying on a warm summer's day (and worth at least 4 stars!).",

Lots of shiny wood booths and cute armchairs of all sorts that I vaguely daydreamed about stealing and putting in my living room if there was any possible way to do so surreptitiously. Which there isn't. So I stopped daydreaming. Anyway...back to the Albion. It's cute inside. However, I was a little disappointed by the food and the service. The menu was exciting - they do a whole roast hog if you order in advance and have a whole bunch of pork-loving friends or maybe a hungry pet tiger. Since I like trying weird things, I ordered the fried pig's ears. They were sort of like deep fried fat. Chewy deep fried fat. Perhaps this is just the nature of pig's ears and not the fault of the Albion, but it could have at least used some sort of dipping sauce to mitigate the taste of a mouthful of oil. Regarding the service, I ordered the pig's feet and a spring vegetable salad. I got the pig's ears. They were aaiiiight. Then I got another order of the pig's ears. Not mine. Then I waited. And waited. And waited. And then I went up to ask about my salad. Apparently they had forgotten to enter my entree. Oops. I know that stuff happens sometimes (I used to waitress) but there was no checking on our table or anything to see how we were doing and possibly notice that I still hadn't gotten my entree. I definitely would still be waiting for my salad now if I hadn't said anything. And sadly, the salad was also...just aiiight. The most interesting thing about it is that it shouldn't really be called a salad. It was hot. Lots of hot spring vegetables may be tasty, but they do not a salad make. All that above blather aside, The Albion is probably a good spot to sit and drink and drink and drink. Just don't expect much from the food.",

Rather impressive. The staff will often remind you you're in a pub that's nicer than most - wearing black uniforms and referring to you as Sir and practically bowing in politeness. You might feel a little stung by the punchy prices (I was drinking San Miguel to be fair) and your relaxation might just be interrupted by the staff telling you they've got a reservation for the very table you're sat at, despite it being one of only 2 without a reserved sign on it on this Friday evening.

Now, maybe it's just my Lancashire roots, but I have to be honest and say that I found the Albion, a little, well snobbish and with ideas above its station.

There were two little ones, under 12 months old (jeez I'm getting to that age when I'm surrounded by breeders!), anyhoo, they'd be told in advance and sticking us in a corner where people stuck in the middle had to crawl over 3 people to get out. Not really on is it? And then a woeful server, does not a four or five star review make.However, the food was delicious and came out a tepid temperature and roughly at the same time, which for a table of 15 people was pretty ok. But, alas, an infrequent server, vacant and stressed looking bar staff do nothing to relax the atmosphere on a Sunday afternoon.Plus points go to the great garden out back which really is terrific. The interior in the nicer eating areas also looks pretty special. If they didn't have the garden (and it wasn't beautiful day), they would definitely lose a star.Give your staff some happy pills. Get some common sense regarding booking large parties in, and offer just a touch more for your indulgent Sunday roasts, then maybe, this could be a 4 or 5 star place. True dat.",

Beautiful and simple presentation. My companions had a cheeseburger and pork chop, respectively. The one with the pork chop savoured every moment of it (it looked so juicy and full of flavour) and cheeseburger girl raved about the fries (er, chips ... can take the girl out of America ...).Beer garden outside looked lovely ... fabulous atmosphere and decor - I felt like I was back in Williamsburg in my undergrad days with the colonial dining sets!Located in a quiet, village-esque neighbourhood, I'm just sad that I don't live close enough to the place to visit it for special occasions ... or at least see a cute server ;)",

    "text": "Hi-di-hi? More like Hi-di-low. Super low. Don't bother trying to come here while Su Pollard is trying her custom-made salad. The one they're apparently naming after her now. \u00a0In fact, don't EVER bother coming here. Unless management AND the chef somehow miraculously disappear.Three of us came in on a very quiet Tuesday evening for dinner. The dining room looked particularly empty, but we were assured that the kitchen was still open, and were told to sit wherever we liked. Our bottle of wine was delivered promptly, but we had to wait well over an HOUR for our simple starters. \u00a0The waitress and manager were purposely avoiding us, so we ended up having to get up from our table to ask them what was going on. \u00a0The waitress then was sent over tio tell us that our starters were on their way out right then. \u00a0Another twenty minutes later, now well past 10pm, our starters FINALLY arrived: cold pre-made pork pie, a decent side salad, and chipolata sausages that actually weren't chipolata sausages at all. \u00a0They were regular breakfast sausages cut into halves. \u00a0As the manager delivered them, she coldly apologised for the wait and said that \"the chef is new and lost your ticket. \u00a0We were aware of it.\" \u00a0Really? \u00a0If the order ticket was lost, then how did you still know exactly what we ordered? \u00a0If you were aware of it, why were you purposely avoiding our table like the plague? \u00a0Yet there wasn't any problem when it came to kissing up to the 60-something year old brightly dressed Su Pollard in her mini skirt and high white fur boots, at the table directly across from us, was there?Despite being starving, we still were polite and said thank you when our food was delivered and when our plates were taken away, etc. \u00a0Yet, for some reason, neither the manager woman, nor the waitress, would say thank you or your welcome back to us. \u00a0Just silence. \u00a0Is it really THAT difficult?We were on our second bottle of red before our main course arrived. \u00a0A cheeseburger with chips that was \"nothing to write home about,\" a decent skirt steak and potatoes, and some pheasant. \u00a0Now, we're truly not people who normally complain. \u00a0But this entire experience was actually just ridiculous. \u00a0The pheasant was extremely pink in the middle. \u00a0It even had a raw consistency. \u00a0Very politely, we asked if it coud be cooked a bit longer. \u00a0The waitress tried to assure us that \"pheasant is supposed to be cooked like that\" but that \"she wouldn't eat it that way, either\". \u00a0So the waitress takes the pheasant away and brings it back about five or so minutes later, rearranged into different pieces. \u00a0At first glance, it looks more cooked this time, thank God. \u00a0But then... ooops, no. \u00a0Pieces are still bloody. \u00a0It was a joke. \u00a0So much of a joke that we had to take a photo on our phones of the bloody pheasant meat after being cooked twice. \u00a0(Please see our evidence in the photo uploaded on here.)The manager tried to compensate us for the wait and sickly grub by telling us we'd get a free bottle of house red on the house. \u00a0And she looked extremely annoyed about it. \u00a0Thanks.It's really a shame, as this place is physically a really beautiful pub in a great neighbourhood. \u00a0It's probably fine for a beer or something, as that should be a lot harder to mess up.As we were working on our desserts, now well past 11am on a Tuesday, the manager puts our bill fot the dinner face up, telling us that (as soon as Su Pollard had gone) they need to close out for the night, and that we need to pay now.Then, after we paid and we'e trying to finish our wine and dessert, a random bar man is sent into the dining room and tells us we need to leave because the pub is now closed. \u00a0Really? \u00a0After we were forced to wait all that time? On our way out however, we notice people sitting relaxed, still drinking away in the pub.Extremely horrific service and mediocre/poor quality food. \u00a0Definitely do not waste your time, money, or patientce here! \u00a0 ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.By the way, the place is also haunted. (And by more than just terrible service.)",

The food is tasty but rather more than what one would expect to pay for similar grub in a similar establishment (for example, an 800g steak to share comes at a whopping \u00a350 which does seem to be a bit on the pricey side). They also do a whole suckling pig for \u00a3300 as long as they have ten days' notice.The best thing about this pub however is the building itself, a lovely Georgian construction with a number of different areas for the consumption of food and drink. its lovely garden, with ivy, willow and wisteria aplenty. A shame it closes at 10pm, especially in the summer, but an even bigger shame is that there are no covered areas for when its raining. Whereas in the days before the smoking ban, no one in their right mind would want to be in the garden when it's raining, in these days a good percentage of smoking customers \u00a0and their non-smoking friends \u00a0would happily sit outside all night if there were some shelter. As a result, I will not be returning to the Albion if it is raining, or if rain is forecast, as there is nothing worse than needing a cigarette, having to go outside, and finding absolutely nowhere to shelter. With a garden this size, there really is no excuse.",

As you are taken through to your table, you pass the main restaurant used for wet and wintry days. On other days like today, the restaurant is in the garden, dappled with sun under a huge willow tree, or further back in an open courtyard area surrounded by tall trees, and a well tended vegetable garden. The garden's capacity is around 70, parties of 10+ seem well catered for table wise, and on the menu with the whole roast suckling pig with trimmings (order 72 hrs in advance).The menu offers a small but varied choice, we started with the pressed pork terrine with home made piccalilli (\u00a36), which was meaty and full of flavour. The two grilled Cornish sardines on toast with capers & herbs (\u00a35.5) were huge, but light, juicy and perfectly cooked.For the main event we opted for the shared 28 day aged (600g) rib of Longhorn beef (\u00a338), which comes thickly sliced in a warm skillet with super crispy roast potatoes, oven baked sweet shallots, large Yorkshire puds, cabbage, buttered carrots and a jug of gravy. I don't think I have ever tasted better roast potatoes, they are fluffy and soft in the middle with a thick crunchy coat. The meat was perfectly cooked, tender and juicy.The Albion is a perfect place to while away a few hours over some beautifully cooked food. Our total bill with desert, coffee and wine for 2, was \u00a390, so it isn't a cheap option, but it is worth every penny spent. Book in advance.",

The old style and a certain grandness gives a clue of what is within. It is not that much off the beaten track, but when you are there, you do not really feel as though you are in this part of town. Drinks are pretty pricey, however they did have a well stocked bar. And that's good. Staff were friendly and served us in a timely manner. The garden was busy but the inside of the pub was almost completely empty, as was the restaurant. I would enjoy returning here for food, as the menu looked good. We all gathered on a large table in the beer garden and enjoyed the company in great surroundings. What's not to like?Well, I have two admit that the outside areas both front and back of the best aspects of assets of the Albion. Whereas the interior, including the tables chairs and decor, reminds me very much of an old-fashioned British sea front hotel - the only thing that was missing was the smell of old people!",

I had been wanting to go here for ages, but considering it is a little bit out of the way and one can never count on the weather, it hadn't happened.Occasion finally arose when, after the Yelp GBK event in Angel, the sun was still shining on a midsummer evening and we were looking for a place to grab a pint outdoors. The Albion is in a beautiful tree-lined residential area, and it pretty much fit the bill 100%. We didn't get to try the food whist there, as the week we were there, they were remodelling the kitchen. Given it was a sunny weeknight, there were still plenty of tables out back that were free, though I can imagine the place gets busy on a sunny weekend. Outdoor drinking near Angel?

I walk by it all the time, on Thornhill Road which is roughly 2 streets over from Upper St and runs parallel to it, and it has the most adorable front area where you always see people sitting outside on a sunny day. I passed by today and people are even there with their laptops or a book because it is just such a nice place to hang out. But when my friend and I stopped by on our pub crawl around Islington the other day, I was amazed to find out that the back garden totally puts the front area to shame! They have the nicest big tree and enough tables to fit hundreds of people. It is exactly where I want to spend my sunny weekends, and it can easily fit large groups which is perfect. Looks like people aren't such big fans of the food, but just come here for a drink, or a few, and the atmosphere!",

From the outside the place is impressive, inside its like a Tardis, it will be great in the summer when the outside spaces can be used. The staff are very pleasant and aim to please, we'd got a small cosy corner but there were going to be 10 of us, no problem the waiter cleared a table in the dining area and sat us there. There's good reason too, he knew we'd probably order dinner later, and six of us did. The menu is clever it offers a mid range of well liked foods, some exotic starters and to die for puds, it's a 'gastro' pub, they have a good turnaround and need to serve up the food quickly. The price range is about right, we had plenty to eat and it was as tasty as it looked. It's going to be a place I'll aim for when in the area, it's a good 15 minute walk to any of the transport links, but worth the walk through a great area of London.",

For a semi-tourist, it was rather out of the way, but the house was very cute, and the atmosphere was very welcoming. I got a glimpse of the beer garden, and I could imagine how glorious it would be come summer time. \u00a0I was very glad we made reservations as it was packed at 3:30, and the tables were all taken by large groups of friends and families. I really don't think we could have been able to dine here if we didn't, and even with reservation, we still had to wait a little. The staff was very nice about it though, so I didn't hold it against them. It was St. Patrick's day after all. Sticking to our goal of getting a traditional Sunday roast, that was exactly what we ordered, along with the braised pork cheek for appetizer and the triple fried fries as sides. First, the pork cheek was very nice and tender. The sauce was terrific, but I suppose it is on the pricey side for just 4 small pieces of meat. Next, the roast beef was very tender and well cooked, but it didn't have much flavour, and was under-seasoned (I had to add salt). It also wasn't very hot when it arrived. The fried whole potatoes that came with the main was alright, but the triple cooked fries were amazing!All in all, I liked the Albion, but the main star of the meal - the roast beef - was slightly lacking.",

So why do I like it less than before? \u00a0I need to tell you a little story... Once upon a time, The Albion was a humble boozer with a fantastic beer garden. \u00a0On sunny days it did a roaring trade, but looking at its affluent Barnsbury neighbours, it wanted more. Calling on its fairy god-renovator, The Albion was transformed into a beautiful gastropub. But it went too far. It became a restaurant. With a \"host\" who won't let you in the beer garden without a brief interrogation, and two-hour reservation slots for tables. Sure, the food's great, if pricey, but beer gardens are for lounging in, not vacating promptly for a second sitting. And Eliza Doolittle's accent keeps poking through. Sorry, I've confused my metaphors... um, things turn decided pumpkin-shaped when you consider Cinderalbion's service. It's awful. We had to ask for everything three or four times. They brought us the wrong wine. And charged us for it, even though we didn't drink it. When we mentioned this to the manager he replied \"We're short staffed\" and flounced off.There are two problems with that.1. The phrase is \"SORRY, we're short staffed\"2. He spent a good chunk of the night drinking and guffawing with his mates instead of chipping in to help his overburdened waiting staff.",

Well the roast was amazing, meat cooked to perfection. I had the pork belly and it was delish, others had lamb and beef and both were cooked to tender medium-rare perfection. Kale was a nice touch and the huge yorkshires (for 75p extra) did the trick. The potatoes were a disappointment - not cooked fully. The dessert was decent, we had the chocolate tart and the creme brulee. \u00a0All-in-all the food was as good as you would expect when you are paying 15-20 quid for a main! The one thing that let them down was the service was VERY slow - yes we get that the place was busy - but as you have to book, well, they should've prepared for the busy-ness by putting on more staff! The icing on the cake of a nice afternoon was the very cute little puppies that people had brought along. Definitely would come back if I was in search of a delicious roast (with puppies) and had some money to burn!",

The Albion came highly recommended by our new neighbors and our estate agent.The pub is neat, it's got the desired old charm about it, including the drafty windows and main door which would not stay closed. Not sure what to expect when we walked in, we snagged the only non-reserved table located directly in front of the bar. Also not sure if the pub offered table service, we marched up to the bar to order. Clearly this was confusing to all involved. After ordering, I asked if table service was provided for tables in the \"bar area\" and was told that, yes, there was table service. Good to know for next time.The beer selection is not great. On draft are your standard English pub selections. In bottles, there were only a few gems to be found, including, but not limited to, BrewDog Pale Ale and Erdinger Weissbier.Both my husband and I ordered the burgers. I'm not a burger lover but it was the only desirable option on the menu for me. We both ordered our burgers medium and they came out well done. The buns were very dry - so dry that I would not risk ordering a burger again, especially with the hefty \u00a312.50 price tag. The triple cooked chips were devine - some of the best I've had in England.Did The Albion fit our needs at the given time (9pm on a Tuesday night after moving all day)? Yes. Will I be sprinting back to The Albion before trying out other pubs in the area? No.People either seem to love or hate this place. I naturally fell somewhere in the middle - a solid three stars.",

I will say the chicken was a bit dry and the sirloin quite tough, but they were tasty and the accompanying sides were incredible enough to almost make up for it. Worth a visit if you're up by Islington.",

    "text": "You know, I actually had a good time at this place. But it was the company rather than the food or (some of the) wait staff that made it so.Came on a Sunday afternoon, and enjoyed seating outside in the English 'Summer'. Ordered the highly overpriced steak (is it an English thing not to ask how I want it cooked? Not sure yet), although I'd be complaining less if I'd ordered the lamb, which was far tastier I discovered on pinching some of my gf's. It was okay, but I'd've probably done as well at Wetherspoons.I quite liked the guy who collected the bill at the end, joking about as he tried to hold the card reader to get reception in the garden, but one of the wait staff got annoyed at us after we asked her on two different occassions that we wanted to order dessert. She refused to take Dessert orders from us, despite standing there with pen and paper(?), so this part took ages. I preferred a Sticky Toffee pudding I'd had up in the Lake District the previous weekend, but my gf preferred this one. Go figure. It wasn't bad.No amazing beers selections, which was a shame, as a table of 20 Aussies relaxing on a Sunday afternoon were bound to have a couple.",

The majority of indoors is also reserved for people eating, over priced poor quality food. This place could be something special if they were not so money grabbing. If most of your clientele are eating then just turn into a restaurant. The Sunday roast I had was more fat than meat! And the class of wine I ordered was the same price as the roast. This is another on of those places where people go to be seen.",

The yorkies were amazing, fluffy but also somehow crunchy (an interesting feat! ) I would definitely recommend this place, great for bringing out of town friends or guests. ....they did play some strange music though (pussycat dolls?

    "text": "I remember my first visit here on a sunny Saturday (we used to have them). It was someone else's round and they brought my beer out to the bright beer garden. I thought it was a lovely place.Subsequent visits have ripped off the head and spat down the neck of that balmy memory.First an evening visit where we tried to enjoy our overpriced short measures despite the fact a group of posh twits was trying to start a fight with us. Luckily they decided that vomiting in the street was a more suitable activity.Then my latest, and hopefully my last visit. The first one where I really had any interaction with the staff. I walked into an almost empty pub with 6 members of staff behind the bar. No-one else was waiting and only 1 of them was actually doing anything (glasses in the washer). I can only assume that they were playing a game of chicken on a quiet day..seeing who would crack first and serve the customer. No other explanation can account for an uncomfortable 5+ minutes where I stood there trying to get attention as they slouched about. I am hardly a meek or minor presence..easily missed! I only persisted as I was meeting friends there so couldn't immediately take my unwanted custom elsewhere. And after all that it turned out they had no beer on anyway.Avoid henceforth I shall.",

No roast beef sold out... no apple crumble, sold out... no sticky toffee pudding... Seriously??? So one choice of pudding, none of my choices available, neither main or dessert... Why have a menu if you can't offer it?",

    "text": "We went there for a Sunday Roast for one of our Aussie friends.Even though I don't mind paying more occasionally for something delicious, the meal was slightly not up to a standard expected in that price range. The lamb was quite good, but nothing exceptional, and the size of the portion was not enough, but it might have been because my bf was digging into my plate as his steak was not as good.The summer garden was great, as it was loads of sun and fresh air, and even when the pub got quite busy it still didn't feel overcrowded. It felt very local and authentic.I am grateful that this place helped me to find my absolutely favorite cider - Brothers toffee apple, but realistically the selection wasn't great.The service was one of the main reasons for a 3 star rating. First of all we were rushed to order food before 1:30, which was less than 10 min after we arrived. That was done in a slightly unfriendly manner. After we finished the meal a girl came twice to take drink orders, but when we said we want a desert she replied that she does not take desert orders. Nice think would have been to ask somebody who \u00a0does take orders for deserts to come to our table (with 20 ppl waiting)... but no... 15 min later she was still only taking orders for drinks. And was annoyed when we asked for deserts again.And on the bright side, the sticky toffee pudding was delicious...",
