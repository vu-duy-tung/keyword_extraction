    "text": "Sartori is a superb new Italian joint, opened October 2010, in the heart of the theatre district in London's West End. I love pizza. By that, I mean I hate Pizza Sexpress, can't stand Deep Bland Pizza, abhor Pizza Slut, can't be arsed with Ask, and please don't get me started on how Dodgy Domino's has single-handedly bastardised the concept of pizza and turned it into the Divine Brown of the UK Pizza scene. (\"You're hungry, you say? And you have no soul? Here, use my Domino's Calling Card! You can find them in most phone booths around town! It will feel great at the time and they will deliver straight to your door!\") Truth is, Brits just don't get pizza. The idea that there exists this unspoken hierarchy of quality that differentiates Ask from Pizza Express from Pizza Hut is absolutely bonkers. Fact is they are all lowest-common-denominator, hen-do-serving chain restaurants whose sole purpose is to shovel out food that is marginally above adequate according to the British palate (and we all know what that means), thus making the most profit possible. It's how Tesco and Starbucks operate, and the discerning foodie should shun them not because they are all corporate and evil like, but because they have forgotten what it means to do things that make you smile. Sartori, this lovely cosy and sophisticated little restaurant in central London, is the perfect antidote to the above. If I tell you that this restaurant transported their pizza oven piece-by-piece directly from Naples and reconstructed it in their basement (no expense spared: the whole thing cost a cool \u00a318k), you might correctly assume that they also shipped-in chefs from Naples to operate the beast as well. And if you know a thing or two about the average food ethic of a chef in Naples, and the commitment they have to the art of making pizza, you might start to understand that you are in for a rare treat. Actually I first heard about this place when I was looking at reviews of my favourite new coffee house nearby, Notes Music and Coffee, who have probably the most expensive and sought-after espresso machine currently in the world. Sartori was noted in the same piece as having the Maserati of pizza ovens. I had to investigate. I had to see it for myself. A quick look downstairs at this oven, and a chat with a waiter, confirms this is indeed the Maserati of pizza ovens. The waiter actually compared it to a Ferrari, but the point is that this restaurant is sufficiently geeky about the construction of a pizza to employ pizzaioli who know exactly what they are doing. Their menu proudly states \"please refrain from asking for a variation of toppings; our pizzaioli are experienced in the art of combining ingredients\"... and my Pizza Napoletana was the evidence. Each new mouthful tasted different to the last, each made me go 'wow', and without wishing to gush too much, each mouthful made me further resolve to tell all my friends about this place. If pizza isn't your thing, there are numerous other dishes from Naples to get excited about. Although the aspirations are high, this is a humble restaurant. The service is smart and friendly, the decor is classy, the atmosphere is intimate, and the prices are astonishingly low given its location. When you visit, you absolutely must go downstairs and take a look at the oven. The chefs might stare at you like you are a bit strange, but it's a thing of beauty. It has an integrated area for storage of wood. What's not to love? A great place for a date or a meal with good friends, and it won't break the bank. If you fancy a coffee pilgrimage at the same time, visit Notes Music and Coffee just down the road (open late).",

    "text": "This is one of my favourite London restaurants; I must have been here about a dozen times! The food is about as authentic as it gets outside of Italy (for example, they use pecorino in some dishes, instead of the default parmesan you see everywhere). I have taken many friends here, and everyone has loved it (including the Italians!). I always have a lot of trouble deciding what to order, because I know it's all so delicious. As almost everyone else has mentioned, the pizzas are definitely worth trying, but the pasta is good too. Just note that the main course portions are pretty huge!Regarding the service, I haven't had any particular issues (once the waiter misunderstood my pizza order, and they made the wrong one, but made me a fresh pizza within about five minutes when I pointed this out). The service is 'Italian style' though: you will see the waiters chatting to each other a fair bit (in Italian of course), and it's sometimes a bit difficult to get their attention. Service expectations differ in Italy, and I think the service at Sartori (and in many other authentic Italian restaurants in London) reflects that.",

I'll go back.. especially for the sausage and greens pizza.. it's rare to find nice open chunks of proper sausage and not just thin slices of cured salami like everywhere else.",

Because of the recommendation, we were able to get in to the busy restaurant with a time deadline (because of another reservation in one hour). It was a fortunate thing for us because the restaurant was of good quality and service.We had a group of 6 people, so we got lucky and the service to meet our expectations and their timing requirements was very good. The restaurant is a upscale Mediterranean version of Italian with thin crust pizzas and a variety of lighter options for dinner.Our group had a variety of dinner choices and everyone really enjoyed them. My pizza was very good, but I think was a bit light on toppings. The potion size was good though. But, the other dinner options were very good as told to me by my colleagues.I would recommend the restaurant based on the quality of the food and the service, despite the very busy nature of the place.",

    "text": "Walked in randomly, and the Italian restaurant is not only busy, but also full of Italians, great and promising start. We went for smoked duck, sundried tomatoes, avocado and balsamic vinegar as a shared starter. This was on the specials menu, well worth a look at. For main I opted for the ruccola pizza and dared not ask for different toppings as per instructions on the menu, but instead put my trust into the pizzaiolos, but I feel customizing your pizza to your make it your own, is also part of the experience... Having said that, this is a must place to have a pizza, next time I will try one of their pastas, as their ingredients were fresh and well prepared. I wasn't that much more adventurous than a house red, but just one glass was enough for me. Very filling and a must go for good pizza. I will also try and open up that second stomach for some dolci/dessert, maybe learn a bit of Italian so I can order in Italian like some of the diners.. or is that a bit much? ! I feel the food was very good but fell short of 'wow' - will definitely be back to tackle my fave secondi, pollo milanese !",

    "text": "Ok pizza combined with bad service. I really didn't expect it to be like this and I'm disappointed, but maybe it's because of the area - they don't feel the need to try hard.We went for lunch on a Saturday. It's two floors - ground and basement. The basement accommodates larger reservations. Maybe half the tables were occupied when we were there.We ordered two of the most standard pizzas possible - the margherita and the classic marinara. I say \"classic\" because they have a pizza called \"marinara\" on their menu, which has nothing to do with an actual marinara. It has anchovies and capers and a pizza like that is generally called a napoletana, but that name was already taken by another pizza. Anyway, after explaining to them what a classic marinara was, they finally made it, although only after arguing with me that it shouldn't have basil on it (and charged me 75p for the addition of this).So when the pizzas came there were several things wrong with both. The margherita, which we ordered without olive oil, had olive oil poured on top. They tried to tell us it didn't have any, but then later admitted it did. The marinara didn't have any garlic and when we inquired about it, they said they decided not to put it on because it was roasted in oil and we asked for no oil. Fine, but tell me that, ask what I'd like to do, and the obvious solution is to put fresh garlic anyway. They ended up brining me a plate of raw chopped garlic - as if that's the same as actually having it cooked on a pizza. What am I supposed to do with that? Eat a bite of pizza and then a bite of raw garlic? The marinara also had very little tomato sauce - it was dry and cracking. They brought some extra on the side, but it wasn't pizza sauce, it was just a vat of pasta sauce.On top of that, we asked a waiter two separate times whether he could please take a picture for us. The first time he just looked at us and walked away and the second time he said \"give me a minute\" and never came back. On purpose. Rude waiters, lousy service, amateur pizza.Nothing was right about this place. No apologies for any of the mistakes. I would not ever go back.",

    "text": "There is nothing worse than a poor attitude. There is simply no need for it, nor is there any excusing it. Especially if you work in hospitality! Note that I am asking not asking for all smiles all the time, but if a customer (operative word being customer) tells you that they are not happy with something, sighing, huffing and puffing is not acceptable.I ordered the octopus with rocket to start, followed by the sea bass. When my starter arrived it was covered in parsley. Now, I hate parsley, but I didn't complain as I just assumed that I had missed that on the menu. I remember seeing that parsley was in some of the main dishes, so I specifically took extra care to order a main that didn't have any.Low and behold when my main arrived, I'll give you one guess as to what was used as the garnish? Yep, you guessed it, that evil tasting green herb. I can hear you asking, '\"why didn't you just put it to one side?\" Reason being, because it was chopped into sand size particles and it wasn't just around the edge of the bowl, but it had infected the tomato sauce too!I informed the waiter of my dislike (hate) for the green goblin and he said something along the lines of 'just eat around it.' \"I will not just it around it!\" I thought to myself Would you ask Superman to just skirt around a pile of kryptonite? I think not! Why I had to explain myself further I don't know, but still, I was made to justify myself so I went on to explain that I had not complained about the 'evil' in my starter, but I was unwilling to endure it for a second time. This is where the huffing and puffing started and with the roll of his eyes he took the plate away.Honestly the dish wasn't that great anyway but perhaps I just ordered the wrong things. My three other companions has a lovely meal. Overall I'd have probably given the food 3 stars but for making me feel bad, you only get two.",

    "text": "Went here with a large group of about 16 people and I have to say, given the glowing Yelp reviews I expected something akin to the glorious Italian food I shovelled into my mouth while touring around the Northern and Tuscan regions of Italy last summer. However, I was more than a little dismayed. First: the service. Clearly everyone here is Italian, which is usually a great omen of deliciousness to come. But this time it led to a miscommunication. Our friend ordered a seafood mix with pasta and when the food arrived he was presented with a slab of swordfish. When my friend protested, the waiter began arguing with him and gesticulating at the menu at the thing he allegedly said he wanted. A few of us testified to hearing him say the other dish, but the waiter refused to acknowledge us in his mini-rampage, assuring him directly that that was indeed what he ordered. Our friend was too embarrassed at this point to continue the argument which was heating up and relented. To their credit, he did say the swordfish was well done and tasty. But I would have fought to the death. The guy sitting next to me ordered a creamy mushroomy, pancetta with spaghetti. I heard him say the pasta part, 100%. They returned with his food, almost 45 minutes later, and there were chunked potatoes on the side rather than the tossed pasta he has asked for. The waitress did get them to make the pasta, but it was placed on the side for him to mix in rather than creating a cohesive, completed dish.My friend and I each got a wood-fire baked, Naples-inspired, 'I Panuozzi'. Mine was the Sarracino with sausage, aubergines, and mozzarella. His was the Estate with Parma Ham, tomatoes, and mozzarella. We went halfsies. These covered, filled, pizza parcels sounded incredible but I found them to be slightly burnt, under-filled, and hard, perhaps due to the delay in stove-to-table delivery. Either way, I just wasn't satisfied. Perhaps I should have just stuck with traditional pizza, which is what this restaurant was recommended to me for. Also, it was SO noisy downstairs. Just unnecessarily so due to the crowding of 4 large tables in the same room as the oven. This made it unbearably hot and almost impossible to speak to anyone. Don't get me wrong- I don't mind the occasional 'Happy Birthday' medley. Just a bit disappointing as this was meant to be our 'social' event. There was lots of clanging and metal dropping which added to the cloud of buzzing conversation. Came out with a headache.",

There was clearly a language barrier which wouldn't have been a red flag for me had the waiters not been disdainful and accusatory toward my friend when an order clearly got lost in translation. Similarly, they poured drinks and handed out menus when we were trying to get them not to and they seemed irritated about our requests in general. The downstairs was much too noisy for easy conversation -\u00a0not just from the chatter of other tables in such a cavernous space but from all the crashes of dishes and carts among the serving staff. I'm not sure why the reviews are so high here except that the food was good, but surely London has places with good eats and service.",

It's a lovely idea, even if it does just add to my yelp to-do list. Sartori was the choice for January, and I was excited to see if I could find a place that served as good of pizza as I had recently had in Italy. Their menu promised authentic Neapolitan style pizza, and I was eager to try. Unfortunately, what I ordered, or maybe my poor understanding of the layout of the menu lead to, what turned up being not even close to what I expected. It was good, flavorful and fresh, but you know, it's always a bummer when you're excited about one thing and you get something else. Like getting a sweater on Christmas in 1996 when you asked for a furby. The service was alright, not very present and difficult to flag down. Unfortunate that my expectations of good service have changed so much since moving to London. The location is great, of course, just in the heart o the West End. Overall, it was an okay meal. Certainly nice enough, but no candle to Italy, and nothing to yelp home about.",

I think the most important part here is ONE METER LONG PIZZA. Which is crazy??? But also amazing. At the end of the day it's average but tasty italian food for a good price. But if you want to impress a large group of friends who are just expecting average food, bringing them here and ordering the meter long pizza is not a bad idea.",

I could have easily had 2 of these and been fully satisfied.For mains I had the ear pasta with broccoli and Italian Sausage. \u00a0It was different to what I normally eat for pasta and really enjoyed it. \u00a0Filly and flavorful and didn't feel too indulgent. Others had the gnocchi in tomatto sauce and mozzarella. \u00a0Also amazing but an insane amount of cheese, so make sure you're hungry as this one's very filling. \u00a0The Bolognese also was amazing and came with equally impressive Pappardelle noodles.The service was friendly and down to earth. \u00a0Very welcoming, although a few staff aside from our waiter were a bit frazzled and couldn't be bothered with our inquiries. \u00a0No big hit however. \u00a0Also we had reservations on a Saturday at 7:30. \u00a0When we arrived they were nearly full but a few open tables here and there. \u00a0By the time we left the queue was massive! Not sure if these were all walk-ins or reservations that had backed up, but word to the wise make a reservation if you're coming on a weekend night.Overall this was a very impressive Italian style joint and I'm eager to come back to try some of the non-pasta mains or even their impressive pizza offerings (which include pizzas up to a Meter long!!).",

The place feels classy with the business lunches going on around us and the wide variety of wines looked very tempting for a tasting at noon.The pizza itself was def insta/snapchat worthy as it spanned across 2 tables, whoever came up with that idea is a genius I tell ya! The flavors, service and company def made it worth the hour long trek into Central London and that day was def one of the highlights of our trip!",

    "text": "The range of pizza options is more than enough to satisfy everyone and you can order a few different options of pizza toppings if you do order the pizza by the meter so it is near impossible to not please the entire crowd. I do not know what toppings I ended up trying as I think we ordered almost every one across the numerous meters of pizza that the group ordered. Even stuffed to the brim with all the pizza I found some room to split a desert with a fellow diner and it was not a mistake!The atmosphere of the restaurant was inviting and while crowded made for a great night out with friends both new and old. And the tables are well set up for the long slabs of pizza, with plenty of room for plates and drinks with the pizzas occupying the elevated center spot on the table.Overall I highly recommend this place and with it's central location it makes for a great meal out in London whether as the highlight of the night or as a pre-show meal.",

All our servers seemed to speak fluent Italian and were very nice, even though we were clearly tourists and had no idea what we were doing. Calamari was just okay, but our pastas and desserts were absolutely delicious.",
