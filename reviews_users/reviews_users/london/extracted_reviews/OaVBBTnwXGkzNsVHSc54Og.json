    "text": "I've never been passionate about veggie burgers the same way people are passionate about their meaty counterparts. I eat them. Occasionally I enjoy them. But generally, I find them bland. Last night, though, everything changed. I was introduced to the puy lentil burger at Gourmet Burger Kitchen. The burger was a piping hot, large green patty on a perfectly toasted sesame seed bun, which absolutely blew me away. I could actually taste the veggie patty, and it was delicious, didn't fall apart and had an even consistency. The curry flavor wasn't overpowering, but it was distinct and worked wonderfully with the tomatoey relish it was topped off with. I'm sure the other vegetarian options are fine--there are a few portobello burger options, and there's a falafel option as well--and I probably will try them eventually, but this veggie burger alone is worth going back for. I also had some fries, which were also super hot. And we had a mayo chili dipping sauce, which was good, though I hear their mayo garlic sauce is even better. I hear their meaty burgers are winners, too.",

    "text": "The same menu as any other GBK. To me, the beef options are not particularly original or impressive, so I usually opt for something more unique (I can get a beef burger anywhere, is my mentality - though my husband assures me the beef is very good at GBK). This time around I had the DELIGHT of their aubergine & goat's cheese burger. Wow, it was absolutely FANTASTIC. Anchored by the largest piece of fried (to me it was more like camembert than goat's cheese) cheese I have ever seen, this mammoth of aubergine, relish, sun-dried tomatoes and salad was heaven in my mouth. The cheese squirted and oozed and was perfectly married with the strong, smoky flavour of sun-dried tomatoes. I'm not a vegetarian, but this far surpassed any meat burger I've ever eaten. Sadly, the lovely aubergine was a bit lost in the midst of these commanding flavours, but it was probably more there for meat than anything else. The service at this particular location was mediocre. Why is it that every time I order a milkshake at GBK, it literally takes 15 minutes to come? It doesn't take THAT long to make a milkshake, folks, and I hate that my husband's finished his beer by the time my drink comes. Of course, since we were in Soho, the place was quite busy, but nothing too rushed as it's a rather small GBK. Food came fast and was hot.",

I like banana best, but the chocolate is also good. I was adventurous and tried the burger with bacon and avocado but I didn't like it at all because the bacon wasn't crispy enough for me, and came with a lot of fat on the meat. My favourite is the chilli burger, which has a nice homemade relish on it, that is sweet but spicy with chips to share as well. Trust me, these are the best burgers to be had and really good value for money. Always good if you are craving meat in a big way.",

    "text": "If you want to pay $20 for a nearly inedible burger, GBK is the place for you! Otherwise, stay away! My friend and I went to GBK on the enthusiastic but badly mistaken recommendation of some locals. It was supposed to have \"the best burgers in London,\" but they were literally among the worst I've ever eaten. My friend is a Kiwi, as were the original founders of GBK, apparently, and I'm an American. We both know a thing or two about food...and burgers. The place is tiny, chairs uncomfortable, cleanliness middling (our table needed to be wiped down twice), noise level high, ambiance nonexistent, and service indifferent. You order at the bar and wait (and wait and wait) for your food to be brought to your table. We got two burgers, chips (fries) with dipping sauce, and two drinks -- and the tab exceeded FIFTY DOLLARS in pounds sterling. Worse yet, the food was nearly inedible -- the burger was overcooked, grey, tasteless; the fries were cold; and the mayonnaise dipping sauce seemed off. So much for GBK's claim of serving only the finest, grassfed Scottish beef. My burger tasted (and looked) like cardboard. You can get a better burger almost anywhere in London -- or the world -- at a fraction of the price GBK charges. I understand GBK's original owners recently sold out to a much \u00a0bigger company, so perhaps it was good once \u00a0but it certainly isn't now. And grossly overpaying for badly prepared, poor quality food only makes the whole experience even worse.",

    "text": "A good joint to get a burger on a night out, but I would recommend to get a discount whether with their multiple vouchers or 50% off the food bill with Tastelondon. Without a discount, it is a very expensive burger indeed. Some might argue that it is a good burger and therefore it is worth it, but if you have chips and a drink you can easily end up paying almost \u00a315 per person. For that price you can get a good menu in a restaurant. Now, that aside, this branch is ok to get something quick before going to the theatre or the cinema or when in the area. However, it usually is very busy, so you will need to make sure that you go with plenty of time because you will most likely be queuing for a while. There are too many tables for such a small place, and so they are all too close and it is difficult to move around some of them. So it is good with a discount for a quick bite if you are in the area.",

    "text": "What? An American flying thousands of miles and out of everything that London has to offer he eats....a burger? Yep, I sure did but it wasn't some crappy U.S.-owned burger joint that litters the world. This was London's very own Gourmet Burger Kitchen. What makes GBK so different from those other companies (Is that a clown or a mime?) that are poisoning the earth? That was my opinion, of course - keep your lawyer dogs at bay. Well, here's some info that I lifted: \"The oversized sourdough buns are baked each morning by our artisan baker. The Aberdeen Angus Scotch Beef, fresh English chicken and fresh vegetables are delivered each day. Gourmet Burger Kitchen uses only 100% Aberdeen Angus Scotch Beef which is sourced from fully traceable grass reared animals.\" These aren't just mere words because the taste of everything (that I had) speaks volumes. A burger, fries and a shake - almost everything was delicious. The flavor of the burger (that had cheese, ketchup and bacon) was great, I had the impression that the fries were originally frozen and the shake was huge. I was stuffed and looking forward to continuing my London walking tour so I could try to burn some of it off. Back in the United States of Obama, specifically in San Diego, we have a similar place called Burger Lounge. The loo at GBK was interesting. Whoever designed this part of the building never took into consideration that I might be showing up because it's not made for someone who is part giraffe. The ceiling is about 6'3\" (if you want that in meters, you'll have to do your own math) and I'm 6'5\". Needless to say, every inch of my sexiness was slightly inconvenienced as I had to keep my head tilted the entire time while I tinkled. You thought you had it bad when you were bombed by the Nazis? N-word, please! London is wonderful and I felt right at home. I look forward to returning someday and I'll try to hit up GBK again. But I'm telling you this right here and now - next time, I am NOT minding the gap.",

Although it sounds like a great option, a burger with chips and a drink for a fiver, the standard of food goes down hill- chips are soggy and burgers solid as a rock.

    "text": "Gourmet Burger Kitchen - Pics @ The London Foodie(thelondonfoodie.co.uk ) I have been one of GBK's most loyal customers over the years since the opening of their first restaurant in Clapham's Northcote Road. Hundreds of reviews have been written about this new London institution, and I am positive they are in no need of further publicity. However, I would like to include GBK in my list of burger joints I will be reviewing in the coming year, as I feel no list would be complete without it. Some might argue that GBK's burgers are not as outstanding as they used to be - I am not sure whether their fast expansion has had a detrimental effect on the quality of their burgers or whether it is just a novelty that is now wearing off. Either way, I personally feel that GBK has been consistently good over the years. I still go back there frequently, and I still love their burgers. GBK has also been resourceful getting its punters through the door in more recent/difficult times. It teamed up with Voucher Codes (vouchercodes.co.uk ) and frequently offers generous discounts via this website. Offers vary from \u00a35.95 for most burgers & chips to BOGOFs on burgers and main courses. All you need to do is to print these vouchers and bring them to the restaurant, highly recommended if you would like to save a few pounds. Following our disappointing visit to Hach\u00e9 in the previous week, Mr G and I headed to the new GBK branch in the trendy Spitalfields Market. The place was buzzing; the d\u00e9cor and lighting are slightly more upmarket than other branches. Our allocated waitress was young and quite friendly, and at my request, accommodated us at a larger table as I needed one with good natural light for the pictures below. I ordered my old time favourite Avocado and Bacon, while Mr G had a Pesterella with two chunky portions of chips. As usual, the burgers did not disappoint \u00a0my burger was delicious and perfectly cooked. The bacon had been beautifully charred and added a smokey flavour to the sandwich that married well with the meaty burger. I love the addition of avocado as it makes the sandwich creamy and rich and counterbalances the other flavours perfectly. Mr G's Pesterella was also good and well presented \u00a0I had tried this burger before but felt that the Pesto tasted as if it had come out of a jar. If you know Pesto, you will know that the jar variety is a very poor imitation of the real thing. The mozzarella was fresh and delicious but as expected, the Pesto was disappointing. Overall, however, the sandwich was good and Mr G munched through his quite happily. The chunky chips were good, but not exceptional, as they were a tad dry. I think there is definitely room for improvement there. The table next to ours sent theirs back and they were quickly replaced by fresher ones. Our choice of Chilean Merlot wine was not available, so we ordered a bottle of the Argentinian Malbec (Norton) which was very good and only \u00a34 dearer, at \u00a316.75 it was still good value. Verdict \u00a0GBK's burgers have been consistently good over the years and have never ceased to impress me. Burgers are meaty and perfectly cooked, and the combination of flavours, which sometimes may seems odd, is well balanced and works well. Their wine choices are good and well priced. Still one of my favourite burger joints in the capital, which I would have no hesitation in recommending.",

I like the prices in there and I really like the quality of the food, especially when you use a 2-4-1 voucher. These are available from their website. Another thing GBK are very good at making are milkshakes. I would rate the Oreo one lots as would my partnerI think they only go to GBK for the milkshakes! Still, if GBK can please someone who was brought up in France then they must be on to a good thing. For a chain they are one of my favorites, and again they have a branch in Spitalfields, which is very handy for the Shoreditch crew!",

Firstly they had no space for us to sit, for a good 15-20mins, aparently you cannot book a table so we just had to wait it out. Once we finally were seated we had to wait a long time for the food to trickle out. Whilst all the burgers did arrive, half of the fries did not, and we had to ask 2 times before they eventually showed up. Also my milkshake arrived after I had already eaten all of my food, which was bizarre, they did however offer a refund for it. Nevertheless, I won't be back soon.",

The staff were unethused except for one guy who actually seemed to know what to do.Ordered the chicken burger with sweet potato fries. The fries were good but the burger was super disappointing. Looked ok on arrival but when you lift the bun you can see just tiny dry pieces of chicken - I can't call it chunks, or strips.. more like tiny off cuts? Quite disappointing and about of a rip off tbh.Don't think I'll be coming back. Not to this branch anyway.",

This time was much better - we arrived at around 7pm on a Friday evening and were seated almost straight away in one of the booths near the back. The staff was friendly and attentive, and talked us through the various deals they had on. It's a Nandos style order-at-the-counter place, and the food comes nice & quickly.I knew I would be disappointed if I ordered a beef burger (especially as an Honest Burger has opened just around the corner), so I went for the chicken, camembert & cranberry. It felt a little bit blasphemous to be eating camembert & cranberry outside of December, but it was absolutely delicious - the flavours were spot on and the chicken was perfectly cooked. I'd definitely order it again if I go back. My only criticism would be that they basically jumped on Paul to collect his plate when he'd finished eating but I was still going, so we did feel a little rushed.",

    "text": "Another day, another GBK. I'm fast becoming their best customer. Armed with my GBK app, I fear not hunger because no matter where I may venture in London GBK is just around the corner... generally speaking.GBK's name is a bit aspirational. It's not gourmet, it's not as atmospheric as say... Byron and it's not as good as Patty & Bun... and they don't let you choose how you want your patty cooked. It's still really just a fast food joint with half table service but the beef burgers here are made with grass fed British beef, the shakes are massive, the fries delicious (and choices numerous), you get free refills on soft drinks, there are vegetarian options, great salads and even a secret vegan option. Yes the prices are extravagant for burgers and fries, even the milkshakes come with price tags to match their serving size but it's London, you should be used to prices like these by now. This particular branch in Soho is tucked away off Soho Square on Frith Street. Like all GBK's you can opt to use their takeaway service but do remember that the shakes become about 35% smaller but remain the same price. If you have the time, take a seat inside, there's no pressure to be a big spender and tip. I will be honest and say that although I appreciate a bit of blue steak and the odd brioche burger, I'm by no means a burger aficionado and have never ordered a beef burger from GBK that wasn't their classic. It's not because their burgers don't look good, they're stacked and look delicious but their secret menu vegan burger, aptly named the 'Dippy Hippy' (\u00a37.45) is so insanely original that I hardly ever entertain the notion of ordering anything else. Add to it some skinny fries, a side of slaw and a bottomless elderflower fizz and that's lunch done (and dinner too because you probably won't need to eat until tomorrow.) Shakes are big and cost over \u00a34 so if you're with someone else, think about sharing. Likewise a regular side of skinny fries is large enough to share if two people are ordering individual burgers. Ketchup is free but posh mayo costs. There's a good lunch menu that starts at \u00a36.95. Essentially you pick a burger and the side is free. If you don't fork out for a drink and just drink water, it will cost you about \u00a37 for a burger & side depending on which burger you choose.The staff here are lovely, I especially love being here when Jonathan is on shift. Oh dear GOD I've become one of those people who are on first name terms with the staff at their favourite burger joint... Do yourself a favour and get the app for loyalty rewards. It's very much worth it. If you're a student let them know and they'll make sure your GBK account automatically entitles you to 30% off food Sunday - Thursday. The offer lasts until the end of August 2014. N.B. Dippy Hippy is a grilled aubergine, pineapple burger topped with spicy peanut sauce, alfalfa sprouts and a slice of tomato and it is everything that's right with the world.",

They often do voucher deals which means a nice cheap dinner. No, they won't be winning any Michelin stars but come on, it's the kind of dinner you wolf down in a messy ketchup and meat-juice mess and chase with an oreo milkshake, you don't savour it while sipping fine wine!I really love the chips and blue cheese dip which has huge chunks of blue cheese in. Yum! My favourite burger is the grilled chicken with camembert and cranberry.I have to mark them down at this particular branch for two reasons. Firstly the guy serving, who I'm pretty sure was a manager or supervisor, was pretty abrupt and rude when serving my friend and I. Also, my friend asked what 'malt' meant as we'd been debating it (sorry, excuse our ignorance) and what the \u00a31 extra charge was to 'add malt' to the milkshakes. He didn't know so asked one of the waitresses who seemed just as confused and then said it meant they'd add Horlicks to it. Erm... firstly, why the hell don't they know what it is when they're adding an extra charge, and secondly, I thought malt meant to make it thicker?Can someone who knows please tell me because it's still bugging me!Overall if you're looking for a quick tasty burger then give it a go - just don't expect it to be 'gourmet' and don't pay any extra charges unless your servers know what they're charging you for!",

    "text": "I went to the Chiswick Park Location and the problem was about the service..wish I could comment on the food (never got it). This was my second time going to a GBK.Anyway, I placed an order over the phone, went in, showed my NUS Card and asked for a student card. It came time to pay and I was told, \"Sorry but you can't use your student card this time.\" WHAT??? \"That is just our policy.\" REALLY? Well that is the most inane and absurd thing I have ever heard regarding student discounts. If that is the case, WHY IS IT NOT WRITTEN ANYWHERE??? The card itself had no issues with stating all other disclaimers, this one seems pretty significant yet it is absent. If there was a GBK up the road, I could more than well use it that SAME DAY. There is no system that validates and activates the card before/upon use, so if this is the policy, I would suggest they put it in black and white.I wasted 50 minutes of my 1hr lunch break!!! RIDICULOUS. I had to join another queue and wait on food elsewhere. I walked like 20 minutes to get to GBK. Why wouldn't she just let up?? I only ordered TWO ITEMS. Stinginess at its finest. I promptly told them NO THANKS, keep the food and I walked out.I went to the Kensington location a month ago as my first experience and the burgers themselves were good. \u00a0I am still debating whether or not to return. Get it together and improve the transparency of your policies !! College students have enough expenses as it is. Don't advertise anything you will not honor.",

It was this garlic mayo sauce and I don't exactly remember the name of the burger I always got but it was really good. I think all the burgers here are tasty so go for it! Don't forget to pair it up with some fries because the fries are sooo good too. Also, the ketchup bottles here are so cute! They look like tomatoes. haha.",
