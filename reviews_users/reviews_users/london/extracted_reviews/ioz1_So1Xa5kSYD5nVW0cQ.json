    "text": "Located in Hoxton Square, in a really great location, the Red Dog Saloon had its soft opening a few days ago and the proper opening today. They describe themselves as authentic American BBQ which pretty much sums up the menu. As it was a nice warm evening I decided to grab one of the outside tables so I can't say much about the interior other than what a quick glance showed me. The inside felt slightly saloon-ish (is that a word?) to me while the outside is mostly generic outdoors seating. Diving right in, after ordering a milkshake to have while reading the menu (haven't had one in years), I noticed a few items had been redacted from it. No idea what they were as I didn't ask. The idea was to have the burger and order something extra to try on the side. This is how I ended up thoroughly stuffed... First off was The Punisher, a massive burger with a burger patty, pulled pork and bacon. This thing was very filling but unfortunately a bit bland. A bit of green would have been nice as well I feel.Next up were the buffalo wings which were probably the best item of the evening. Nicely deep fried with a slightly crispy exterior, perfectly cooked inside and a spicy mix on the outside with a good amount of heat.The ribs were a bit like the burger, looking much better than they were. Flavour wise they were a bit bland with not much flavour coming through but they were really nicely cooked though. Overall not a bad place if you're in the neighbourhood but I'm not sure I'd travel there to have it.",

Some friends had the Devastator and Punisher burgers and raved about them. So we decided to go back this weekend. But it didn't quite live up to the first round. Had the Punisher burger and it was lacking - perhaps they missed the sauce or overcooked the burger, but it was kind of dry, a good burger, but not stand out. Service here could also be improved - our waitress was not very attentive (forgot to bring us things we asked for, took forever to bring our bill, etc.)",

I've visited twice now and both times the staff have been really friendly and it actually has quite a nice atmosphere, inside (lots of wood) and outside has a decent seating area.This place has lots of good 'ol American BBQ food on the menu, which is something I personally enjoy. If you're a vegetarian you might not find what you're looking for here.The pulled pork sliders and coleslaw was quite nice, but the real reason to go here is the devastator burger challenge. It's an absolute mountain of food, not no mention there's a large milkshake to finish too. For the \u00a320 something pricetag I actually think it's quite reasonable, however this is no fine dining establishment by any stretch of the imagination.But if you like meat & BBQ sauce, I'd say it's worth a visit.",

Buffalo wings were tasty with that 'crunch' you get from proper deep frying, served up with blue cheese dip but no celery. I prefer the original flavour over the BBQ and sweet but that's personal preference. I will work my way up to the Naga Chill challenge soon tho as I do like it hot! Sides are, as with all places around Hoxton, expensive \u00a33 for a handful of fries but if you're hungry the rib dinner make better value. 1/4 chicken comes with 3 pork ribs or there's the St Louis cut pork ribs that were melt in the mouth delicious. I wasn't so keen on the beef ribs, a bit too fatty and bland for my liking. They do a Philly Cheese steak challenge, 2ft cheese steak which is free if you can finish it in 45mins, otherwise it's \u00a327.50. Nice range of imported beers tho the Dixie is brewed under licence. Have never yet had room for dessert but they sure look good! Free live music in the basement on Friday nights.",

I think the only thing they had going for them was the macaroni and cheese with bacon. But that's it. We were seated downstairs which was fine and within 5 minutes of getting settled, our waitress took drink orders and wanted to know our dinner order as well. We nicely explained that we had just sat down and would need a minute before ordering dinner. She became visibly annoyed but kept taking drink orders. 45 minutes later, people were still waiting on drinks and getting restless (we hadn't even been given water yet!) Dinner came out very slowly and most of it was cold. The ribs were ok, but extremely fatty with hardly any meat. When it came time to pay, we all sat with our money/cards and the server was nowhere to be seen. One of us had to go wander around until we found a staff member and asked if he could go find the waitress. When she finally made her way over, she was sassy, rude and just unpleasant. I'd stay away from this place, and if you decide to brave it, definitely stay away from Kate. Yikes.",

I say this just to, you know, ensure you that the absence of smoked BBQ at a smoked BBQ joint did not escape me. Otherwise, Red Dog Saloon had great potential. The interior with its abundance of wood, booth seating and casually dressed servers hit all the right American-BBQ-joint notes. The blackboard of the day's specials, the pitchers of draft beer, the rowdy and lively atmosphere created by the after-work crowd partaking liberally in the pitchers of draft beer - it all felt legit.But, again, no smoker.But, then again, I am a vegetarian, so does that matter? Yes. Yes it does matter. Because I go to smoked BBQ places so that my dining companions can partake in smoked BBQ. And when there's no smoked BBQ for them to try, I am disappointed by proxy.That said, Red Dog Saloon's rendition of mac & cheese was certainly better than any I've had elsewhere in London, and the sweet potato, avocado, and feta salad I got to accompany it was delicious and oily - a fattening delight. My companion enjoyed his 'Punisher' burger, which came with pulled pork (presumably not smoked as it would have been otherwise), but it wasn't particularly special.The fries? Those were fantastic. Probably because they were covered in salt. But fantastic nonetheless.The spicy chicken wings are supposedly very good, and I saw plates and plates of them coming out to the hoards of men drinking their aforementioned pitchers of beer. So maybe that's what Red Dog Saloon is all about for the time being: pitchers of beer and hot wings. Since I can't think of a single other London establishment where you can get pitchers of beer and chicken wings, I think that might be just enough to make this place thrive...",

Plus the service can be a bit on the slack side (tonight I must say the service was fairly good). Now for the foooood. The wings are simply the BEST. You will need to try them to understand. My favourite main is the burnt end sandwich. Other options include pulled pork, chicken, ribs and a selection of burgers and awesome milkshakes.

    "text": "I went here a couple of weeks ago to attempt the devastator challenge along with a few friends on mine.The cost of the devastator burger is \u00a317.00 but when you attempt the challenge which comes with a milkshake and fries the cost jumps to \u00a327.00 pounds which I think we can all agree is quite a jump.The price of the challenge isn't on the menu, presumably as the rise in cost would be many people off and I imagine many people are caught out when the bill comes.The burger itself tasted better than I expected it would but not perfect.The milkshake was essentially a pint of blended ice-cream which tasted nice and the fries whilst cooked properly were far too salty, a sentiment which everyone at the table agreed with.You only have ten minutes to attempt the challenge and sadly we all failed. Though we were a bit slow to start the challenge a friend of mine almost managed it and I think my attempt wasn't too bad (see uploaded picture). The record was just under 7 minutes so it's quite doable if you are good at eating challenges.From what I have learnt from talking to eating challenges 'experts' always choose vanilla or the simplest of flavours when choosing a milkshake.The staff were very friendly and there was some good banter between the waiters and my friend whose attempt was atrocious, he only ate one third of the burger and barely touched the fries and milkshake and as he's 6ft 4 you would expect him to have done better.",

They were perfection and I really didn't want it to end. Not too saucy, cooked just right with that buffalo tang that I have longed for in London. My other friends tackled the devastator...just go to the website and take a look at this monster...RIDICULOUS...but they managed to finish it! The \"house white\" was amazing too and a bargain at twice the price! So, get yourselves down there folks...a lovely night out.My only let down was the ranch dressing. Believe it or not, one of the reasons I decided to venture over! When I asked for it, there was some confusion saying they didn't have any and finally, a waiter came out with a small portion. It had essence of ranch but definitely not the real deal...and...wings just aint wings without the celery sticks...please add them next time :-)",

    "text": "Yup I'm a fan - Why? Because we stumbled upon Red Dog trying to get a quick bite on a Wednesday after a long work day and were pleasantly surprised. Service: Admittedly, it started off a bit awkward. We walked in and asked if there were any tables available (note: there were definitely tables available) and the hostess asked if we had a reservation, passed us on to someone else - sort of - as he wasn't aware we were being passed on. \u00a0We ended up just approaching the server outside and getting a table straight away. Whew! After 5 years in London my service expectations aren't very high but throughout the rest of the night the guy taking after outside was SUPER attentive.I was almost afraid of making eye contact as each time I did he either ran over or made a sign to ask if we needed him. I'm only noting this as we were actually shocked by how on the ball he was for late on a Wednesday when after work crowds were still pouring in.Food: Pleasantly surprised. We left the house seeking a \"healthier\" option so I settled on the Cobb Salad - and was delighted. I opted for the appetizer portion but it came out much larger than I expected and full of avocado (what!), tomatoes, bacon bits, chicken - my only disappointment is that upon taking home the takeaway menu I see that it isn't listed as an option (bummer!). \u00a0Since I only went for the \"smaller\" portion of salad I also ordered prawns with dipping sauce. \u00a0Caveat: You need to WORK for your prawns - these babies come out heads and all. I'm not sure what sauce they had them sitting in prior to hitting my plate, but it was delicious. \u00a0If you're feeling spritely and have the patience to unwrap these - you won't be disappointed. For those looking for a meatier option, my partner chose a burger, and said it was nothing to write home about - in that case I'd stick to Meat Mission right around the corner.As this is a neighborhood local for us, I'm pretty pleased - though I wouldn't make the trek over from other parts of the city just to get a taste.",

    "text": "Whilst I may on occasion bemoan the lack of sophistication that a lot of American food lacks, I do have a dark side which craves smoky meat slabs...and in that respect, Red Dog does not disappoint. \u00a0Modelling itself as an American Midwest joint, the walls are aptly covered in paraphenalia from Colorado, Arkansas etc, and the restaurant boasts a smoking pit on site. \u00a0I will say that, although I know sod all about dates, this is not an ideal date location (the boy:girl ratio in this place makes Imperial College's gender imbalance pale in comparison).The fare is pretty much as you'd expect: pork ribs, beef ribs, chicken, good selection of burgers, very little greenery...their drink selection isn't bad either, offering beers such as Sam Adams and Sierra Nevada, albeit at \u00a34+ a bottle. \u00a0I tried some of the wings (there are three choices of sauce - BBQ/buffalo/honey-mustard glaze) which weren't bad - decently sized, but a little overcooked. \u00a0For the main event, I tried the half-rack of pork ribs with onion rings, whilst I also nicked some pulled pork and collard greens from my-not-unsuspecting dining partner. \u00a0The ribs are good - whilst they don't quite fall off the bone, the smokiness definitely comes through nicely, and the quality of the meat is pretty good too which is a plus. \u00a0The pulled pork was also tasty, and nicely moist. \u00a0I really enjoyed the breadcrumbed onions - it's great when they're not slathered in an impenetrable layer of batter and holding twice their weight in oil. \u00a0The mandatory coleslaw which comes with every dish isn't really to my liking, but I can't hold that against them as it's not something I'm a fan of anyway.All in all, I'd happily come here again. \u00a0It's not the cheapest place - \u00a316 for the half-rack and a side - and the portion sizes are the least authentic bit of the place (although to be fair, the wings and ribs were plenty for me), so unless you order the 50-wing bucket (a tempting challenge) or a full rack of ribs, you won't be ending up in a food coma. \u00a0I think the food is a solid 3.5 stars in general, but bumped up to 4 based on location - this is one of those things that is hard to find in London, and Red Dog do a more-than-respectable rendition of this type of cuisine. \u00a0Since Hawksmoor is rather beyond my means, I know where I'll be going if my raging inner carnivore kicks up a fuss.",

    "text": "I'm going to apologise. This is going to read less a review, but more a post-mission debrief from a wartorn battleground; a meaty, delicious battleground, where the fork is your rifle and the near-1kg Devastator Burger your enemy.So let us set the scene; an unusually mild Wednesday evening in London's Hoxton Square. Long time hangout of East London's hipsters and scene of many a summer's evening spent sipping on lukewarm Strongbow, tucked away in one corner stands a bastian for the growing number of Britain's competitive eating fraternity; the Red Dog Saloon.From the cool American Blues BBQ interior, to the All-American style smiling greeters waiting for you when you first enter, Red Dog nails that authentic diner style vibe. The Polaroid's stuck on the 'Wall of Flame' and the 'Book of Heroes', filled with those brave souls who beat the Hot Wing or Devastator challenges, add to that feeling that this is an experience straight out of Man vs. Food, \u00a0a show that owner Tom Bert clearly takes inspiration from.And so on to the food; eight young men entered, and of those four ordered the Devastator Burger, a behemoth of a burger weighing in at over 3,000 calories and containing no less than three beef patties, six bacon rashers, six slices of cheese AND a handfull of pulled pork to boot.Of those four, only one, yours truely, was foolhardy enough to attempt the 'Devastator Challenge' offered with the burger. The rules, simple; eat the burger, a side of fries and drink an entire milkshake within the time limit. The limit, you ask? 30 minutes? 20 minutes? Oh no. Ten minutes; a mere 600 seconds between you and glory. The timer was started, and we were off.And that is as glorious as this story gets. Ten minutes was too short by half; the burger was gone, but the fries lay intact and the milkshake without a dent. This brave hero was felled by the Challenge; but in that I take no shame.The burgers at Red Dog are delicious, the pulled pork a particular highlight. The beer selection is limited but delightfully Anchor Steam is available on tap, a rarity in London, and the milkshake was as delicious as it was painful to drink.If you like beer, meat and a lively atmosphere, you will love the Red Dog. Just be wary of the challenges on offer; the Wall of Flame is reserved only for the truly elite.",

You can get better patties elsewhere, sure, but for variety of toppings and combined with the atmosphere, it's a winner for me.

The burnt end pie itself was a little pot of delectableness, and while the onion rings were average at best, the salmon was from another World. A World where Salmon are worshipped as Gods and upon capture cooked to perfection.I will be returning here in the not too distant future (next week) and will be ordering the exact same dish (adventurous I know) with the exception of the onion rings. I will sub them out for the fries which are also little strips of potato heaven and who knows, maybe when I man up a bit I may come out of food challenge retirement and take on the devastator challenge.The saloon/restauarant is located in Hoxton Square which is a cool place itself if not a little hipster-ish. The saloon can get busy from 6pm onwards so I recommend booking in advance if you are in a party bigger than four. The decor is true to the name and like an American Western style saloon while there is a good energetic atmosphere both inside and in the outdoor area.",

    "text": "Although I like to think of myself as a staunch patriot I have to admit the American's know how to do meat. \u00a0While a British BBQ typically involves luke warm sausages and a couple of dry burgers the yanks create food handed down to them by some sort of meat god. \u00a0As a result I have been hitting the american bbqs and diners and hitting them hard and after spending many happy lunches in bodeans and the various diners I came across red dog. \u00a0A lot cheerier than the others and in a good location I was ready to add a stone of extra meat.The place was quiet which wasn't great for the atmosphere but the service was good as a result. \u00a0It was around 3pm so can't complain. \u00a0The best thing places like this can offer is a cheap way to try everything, unless you have a real craving for one thing then you want to try everything. \u00a0The wings were good but i've never been a real chicken person but the ribs were just awesome. \u00a0Crispy, tasty outside, fell off the bone but still felt substantial in the mouth. \u00a0Man, they were good ribs. \u00a0The pulled pork was pretty amazing too, they do pork well obviously. \u00a0Had the small burger afterwards which was good for \u00a36, better than burger chain restaurants and was a nice finish. \u00a0Having three animals in one sitting made me feel like a roman emperor.Didn't feel for desert and had to be elsewhere so drinking was off the cards but they had beers both on tap and in bottles which is far too rare. \u00a0On draught they had a couple of standard numbers like amstel but also the camden brewery beer which has been popping up around London which is pretty tasty. \u00a0The bottles were all american and I was impressed by the selection.As much as I love American it's never going to be blow my mind good but this was very, very good. \u00a0Would like to go there on a night out so I can drink but dancing afterwards could be challange. \u00a0They had a downstairs for music which I was told would be up and running regularly, that would make it pretty good. \u00a0I had fun and I'll go again, what more can you ask for?",

I ordered the meaty beans (if you're going to a BBQ place I figure there is no point trying to be healthy) and they were pretty good. Not great, just good.Also: the service is a little slow.Also: I wish they didn't try and come up with some trendy update to the Long Island Ice Tea. It's a classic for a reason, don't mess with it.Also: I sort of object paying \u00a325+ for a meal where the food arrives on plastic trays.Also: I felt a bit sick once we'd finished. That's my own fault for being a greedy hog. But there's a difference between feeling overfull of awesome food (which you don't regret at all) and overfull from average food (at which point you wonder why you bothered eating it)On balance: next time we come to trendytown we'll go elsewhere in search of dirty, carnivorous thrills.",

Glorious, glorious american good. It did not disappoint at Red Dog. Our massive smorgasbord included (but was not limited to): Pulled pork sandwiches, onion rings, root beer floats, mac n' cheese with bacon AND milkshakes.Yes, I was in heaven.My only complaint? The service. Slow service and a sour faced waitress.",

Food on plastic trays, sliding around in grease is going to have to be outstanding to win me over.

I really like the menu, it's on the smallish side but seems flexible so that you can pair up your favourite items (see various combos, fried chicken by the piece, three sizes of wing portions).The fried chicken with waffles was delicious, I've been burnt often by dry tasteless fried chicken in the UK but this was moist and the crust was spicy, a real revelation. Three pieces and the sweet waffles would have been enough but in my greed I chased it with buffalo wings. Again these were great, I prefer mine a bit sloppier but that's just a taste thing. I tried the ribs, brisket, chilli side, meaty beans and all were great. The only thing I didn't love was the coleslaw, nothing wrong just a bit bog standard.Drinks: \u00a35 a pint for Camden Pale Ale unfortunately seems the going rate, and at least it wasn't coots light. Mates had Sam Adams, which people always seem to get excited about. The staff were really nice and patient while we waited for our friend to arrive, generally efficient and smiley, I don't need any more.They lose a star on a couple of points: the veggie options are extremely limited, granted they're a meat place but the only real option was a bean burger. They sat the six of us in a booth, which was extremely snug and combined with the vast consumption of meat led to a sweaty affair for those by the wall.",

    "text": "We came here to do the Hot Wing Challenge. And honestly, there was a severe case of chickening out. I was sick! I couldn't eat a ridiculous amount of hot food as my nose was already not doing well. And also I observed someone else do it while I was waiting for a table, and it was not a pretty sight. Not at all. Perhaps more liquid courage next time...But we had dinner anyway. We did try some of the regular buffalo wings and some of the spicy mustard wings. They were decent, but kinda lacking for me. I went for the spicy burger. There was a good amount of heat in it when I got to the habanero peppers, but it wasn't that great. The patty itself was lacking in flavor and the bun was really crumbly and fell apart. The meaty beans were good, but the chips were pretty terrible.As a plus, they do have unsweetened ice tea which, as an American, I fully support. They did have a rather crappy selection of hipster beers on tap though. Which as a non-hipster-beer drinker, I wasn't a big fan of. The service was pretty good though, so that was a plus as well. So yeah, it's a fairly average Americana style restaurant. I wasn't overwhelmed by anything. The few barbeque sauces I tried on my fries were a bit lackluster as well. I think I'll only be back when I gain enough liquid courage to blow my mouth out with ridiculously hot wings, but for burgers, there's definitely some place near by that I would go to before coming back.",

Seriously, whenever I look over a restaurant menu, I ask myself, \"What are they least likely to screw up?\" But Red Dog Saloon knocked my socks off with 1 simple meal:: the Bar-B-Q chicken sandwich.

It was so good that it didn't need any of the sauces on the table, though I sampled-and loved- them all.I also order the collard greens, which had actual pork in them, so I had to send it back.

I don't get why you'd ruin it with a challenge that would potentially make you sick, so I didn't do the challenge, I did order the burger n fries though.The fries are tasty and well seasonedThe Devastator, my my what meat taste sensation it is. 3 burgers, cheese n bacon to compliment them, and topped with 200g of pulled pork... good lord the pulled pork is niceeven with my non-challenge unlimited time, I still couldn't finish the burger and left a fair wodge of my chips so was quite dissapointed in myself :) just means I'll have to go back for a round two.My friend had the chicken, fries and mozerella sticks, he was pretty happy with it all.I won't speak for all the staff as that feels a bit like brutal, our waitress I'm not sure what to say really, it wasn't even that she came across as just going through the motions, I almost felt like we'd offended her somehow or that we were really inconveniencing her by being there, it took a noticeable amount of time to get drinks, and then order (when I was ordering she made no mention of the 'challenge' despite me ordering the burger that was it, seems a little silly from sales point of view not to encourage people to do it), there was no smile, and often she'd be looking elsewhere in the reasonably empty restaurant. this was slightly compounded by later into the meal I noticed her at two other tables very chatty and smiley, maybe she disliked my beard or my friends bald head, who knows...the service though I will always try to never let that mar my view of a place two much unless it happens on return visits... and when I can next get myself down to London I will most definitely be returning",

    "text": "If you're a big meat lover then this is probably the place for you as pretty much all you can get on the menu is a lot of meat! Hoxton Square is a charming little square in London with restaurants at each corner but Red Dog Saloon is by far the most popular. Not being such a meat fan, I was quite skeptical about going to this restaurant but thought I would give it a go. For starters I went with the deep fried catfish and it was amazing. It was so light and delicate and came with tartar sauce. For the main dish I went with the ribs and pulled pork combo. Main courses usually come with two sides of your choice and I chose the mashed potato and onion rings. I found the ribs a bit too fatty to enjoy and ate most of one but couldn't manage the other one as fat is what really puts me off eating meat. But my good God, the pulled pork was amazing! I have never had pulled pork before but will be having it again. The mashed potato was lovely and creamy and onion rings were.... Onion rings. Don't be fooled by only getting two ribs when you order a rib combo... They are massive! I have never seen so much meat on a single rib before. The staff were very friendly and tentative, which is great because they bill you a service charge. The restaurant does get quite loud though so you have to kind of shout at the person/people you're sitting with. I think the dessert let the meal down, there wasn't a great selection and I think they come up to your table with more quantity than quality. Great selection of drinks on the drinks menu though! See you again, Red Dog Saloon ;)",

She picked fries and the salad with blue cheese dressing as her sides.We shared the fries but she loved the salad. The ribs were also amazing, just peeling off the bone. The chicken also good but not as special as the ribs. In the end she couldn't finish all the meal.I had the pulled pork chilli sandwich thingie (\u00a313) which came with a side of coleslaw. It was very good especially with some of there Texas BBC smokey sauce added to it.We had 3 cocktails between us and total bill was \u00a360.00 so was very reasonable for the taste, quality and service.",

You pay to eat as much as can, and you also pay to try to eat the food soaked in that spicy sauce. The conditions of the challenge are pretty harsh. No water/liquids for 15 minutes after having your food with the spicy sauce!I'm sure the person who wins it can bid farewell to their taste buds and would create an upside down volcano when they go to the loo.Will post more details later",

This was going to be big.The Red Dog Saloon has a challenge where you have to eat 6 of the hottest wings ever within 10 minutes. None of us were daring enough to attempt the challenge itself, but some of the guys in the group wanted to try a wing. Just to see. It was carnage! All three who tasted the wing were in some obvious agony and were feeling the effects the next day. Based on this evidence, I would not recommend attempting this challenge unless you are a fan of very hot food or you are insane.We had a lot of choice available to us for the meal proper. If you choose something from the Pit Cooked Bar-B-Q column down the middle of the menu, you will be laughing. I was torn between a couple of the combos, but three of us ended up ordering a Carnivore platter to share. This has a generous helping of all of the barbecued meats. There was certainly enough for the three of us to have a good taste of everything. My favourites were the ribs and the sausages. The platter came with two sides per person, so we got a variety. They were ok, but really you're coming here for the meat.I was uncomfortably full at the end of it. It's counterintuitive, but this is how you want to feel at the end of such an eating session.

I went for ribs and my friend had the Pitmaster special, brisket and pork in a bun. The ribs were good, the meat nice and tender, wasn't too impressed with the BBQ sauce but I'm not a Kansas type of guy, both sauces were a bit too vinegary for my taste, but the ribs were good enough without them. Mac n cheese and beans were tasty sides, and the Pitmaster went down well. Good and tasty apparently. It was huge and messy, exactly what you want when you eat BBQ.

I've had better elsewhere. At \u00a335 per head for a starter, main and a couple of drinks I can't help but feel a bit cheated as I left hungry. I also disliked that they add a service charge, considering the minimal service provided this just seems a bit cheeky.",

    "text": "We finally managed to go here. I had been wanting to go to the Red Dog Saloon for a while now and it completely delivered on my expectations. First of all, they take reservations. Given the fact this is a famous burger-place, that's definitely a plus-point, compared to all other burger-places here in London. And you get exactly what you're expecting: great American-style wings (we took first the combination platter and then went for a second round of the spicy mustard ones), pitchers of beer and fatty juicy burgers. I had the standard bacon cheeseburger, topped with two extra patties, making it 4 layers of meat, bacon and cheese it total. This was heaven dripping down my fingers. The whole thing staying relatively together while eating.I do have to say I expected the burger to be a little bit bigger (given that I made it almost double it standard size). Maybe it's because I was already a bit drunk, but I had no problem finishing it (having had some wings beforehand and a side-order of fries to share as well) while I was expecting to have some heart-failure afterwards, which wasn't the case.But in the end, a great evening with friends and some great American-styled food.",

    "text": "Ordered: The Devastator ChallengePrice: \u00a327Review: DO NOT BRING SOMEONE ON A DATE HERE FOR THE CHALLENGE. THE DATE WILL END IN MISERY. (Saw someone doing this - probably ended up with him going home alone). Perhaps not the most legitimate of reviews as I had rallied a few co workers to eagerly attempt this challenge! We had been beating our chests like small primates, talking trash, intimidating one another for.....two months just for this challenge. The Devastator comprises of - 500ml of milkshake (Vanilla for me), a bowl of crispy fries, and the burger (3 patties, 6 bacon slices, 6 slices of cheese, salad, tomato and incredible sauce)...So the crowd I went with - 5 men, 5 devastator's and 1 victor. Luckily, perhaps not so luckily, I managed to eat the The Devastator under 10 minutes (the challenge) and won. The unfortunate part - I wasn't truly able to appreciate the delicacy of the burger. The burger itself was extremely tender - much better than I had expected - perhaps a waste to eat it all in sub ten minutes! I will come here again with my fellow friends at some point! My father and mother were joking about coming here to share the burger....but not to race. I am slightly worried about their proposal as they are quite the fearsome foodies too.Nonetheless - great place for a burger fan. Very juicy burger indeed! Definitely worth the extra mile to travel to Hoxton Square.",

They are crispy on the outside, succulent inside and covered in a sauce that if I believed in a god, would be made from his own recipe. I'm of course referring to the original buffalo but the bbq are good too. The pulled pork is great, ribs good and the burnt end sandwich is mdhebahudb. \u00a0Oh sorrryyy dribbleded on my phine keyboard not working. No honestly this place is so tasty it makes me feel so happy inside just thinking about it. The only downside is that it gets so busy they need to expand as often have to wait ages for a table. And good luck trying to book it needs well over a week in advance to get a table on a weekend. Stay away they're my wings!!!",

    "text": "American food was trending heavily in London a few years ago, and it definitely feels like RDS was there to ride the wave in order to warrant its popularity and number of branches. I've heard generally positive things about it so was happy to meet a few friends here for the food and to give it a test.Don't. Mediocrity upon mediocrity, everything here was average to bad - made worse by the fact that it's expensive for what it is. Chicken Wings - average to ok, with nothing special to distinguish themFried Chicken - tasted like KFC...made me want KFC instead. Still, probably one of the better dishes on the menu as it comes with two sidesSt Louis Ribs - terrible. Almost tasteless. One of the most expensive items but not worth it in anyway. Also, their Friday deal of \u00a311? It's because they give you a smaller portion - you probably lose out by getting this deal instead of ordering it straight up with sides. Brisket - ok. Nothing special Onion Rings - bad. Had to send them back to ask them to cook it more as the first batch were undercooked and didn't taste like onion. The next set were improved but their recipe just sucks.Fries - worse than oven chips. Seriously. Macaroni Cheese - Didn't taste much like cheese. \"Tender Broccoli\" - wasn't very tender. Wasn't very good.Banana Split - if you like artificial tasting ice cream you'll love this. Otherwise meh.Mississippi Mud Pie - Looked like a pile of slop but tasted ok.Overall: The food here is not very good and will make you pay a hefty amount for it. The service was REALLY slow, albeit fairly friendly and eager to help when we raised any issues. All I can say is that there are PLENTY of other places in London that offer good American/BBQ food at much better prices. I would pick Bodeans over RDS, and I don't even like Bodeans that much.",

Which was 12 wings...we got to choose three flavours. Buffalo, Bacon & Maple and then Cajun. Bacon ones were the surprise favourite. Came with a blue cheese dip. These were ok. A little \"takeaway\" for a place like this. Little over done. Coatings were great however.Mains, I had the brisket, with Mac n cheese, onion rings. My colleague had the chicken and rib combo with sweet potato fries and spicy sausage.The spicy sausage was essentially a saveloy - which was great. But a little more thought would have been nice. The main meats were superb. Absolutely great.The brisket was tender, served dry with table sauces of different kinds. I could barely finish the two large slices I had. The Mac n cheese had bits of ham in it (as an option we took) and tasted great. Sweet potato fries were a little over done, but that's ok. Not burned! Onion rings were as you'd expect.Drinks wise - there's a nice selection of beers and cocktails - the cocktails are expensive for what they are. My margarita (orange adjusted) was \u00a310, and really didn't feel like a \u00a310 cocktail. The beers however are priced right and plentiful.I'd be back. With some slight adjustments.",

So far my expectations were set really high after Brixton's The Joint and Bodeans in Soho, earlier this week.As it happened, the sandwich served in Red Dog was the worst of the trio. It wasn't very meaty, splices of pork were hidden inside the large bun and you had to dig through the first few bites to actually enjoy the taste.Sauce - what sauce?! I had to poor a pint of some watery mud from the plastic bottles laying on the table (they are labelled with some fancy names, \"Kentucky Spice\" or something similar, but don't be fooled, it's probably ketchup mixed with some more vinegar).Alright, at least the buffalo wings that we had before the mains were kinda tasty, though chicken is not my kind of thing.",

Naturally I went with the Californian burger, which was fairly succulent and juicy. I can't say that California has some \"niche\" taste, but I suppose the avocado and bacon pairing comes close. I would however recommend adding spicy pepper jack cheese to the burger to give it a kick as the burger tasted mildly bland. Definitely trying the ribs next time as they appear to be quite the hype.The vibe was buzzing and loud, so I would recommend this place for groups versus dates.",

Even if that was probably for her own sake she does love a good spicy meal so I would have liked to see her try.Anyway, the burger itself was quite tasty, however the bottom bun was so moist from all the cheese and whatever liquids a burger has that is was impossible to pick up. I had to use a knife and fork to eat it and for me that's not the best sign for a burger. Some of my friends' burgers were the same so it's safe to say that was not a one time incident. Anyway, I wouldn't be totally opposed to going back but it certainly would not be my first choice.",

    "text": "Three of my closest friends and I have always been on a quest to find the best burgers in London. Of late, we have been side-tracked as this blog has made me want to seek out all sorts of dining experiences out and about in London.Myself and Jacki (fellow burgster), recently hung out and it was only right that we check out a burger place. We headed to Red Dog Saloon in Hoxton Square to seek out their burger offering. Red Dog prides itself on offering authentic southern US fare with an emphasis on bbq meat. They talk about award-winning smokers imported from the US and techniques that include using hickory and mesquite for specific smoked flavours. I don't know how much the hungry diner takes notice of this, but we were drawn to it because of the buzz of people and I had previously made a late night stop there. Now I have had a couple of good burgers, Patty & Bun and Dirty Burger to name a couple so I know what I like. There is an importance in the consistency of the meat (i.e. no fatty pieces or gristle), the ability to cook it as you order (mine is always medium rare) and how the bun/bread stands up to the filling (i.e. not so soggy that it falls apart). Side orders are more often than not the chorus line to the main star, so can be forgiven for being mediocre. In this case, let me first take you to the side order of mac and cheese. No. It was congealed yellow stuff that lacked taste. I go here first, because I really had high hopes for this, having watched my gran make it over the years. The burgers were okay. Maybe we caught them on a particulary busy night and off day, but it really did not pack the punch that the decor, buzz and perky staff built it up to deliver. We had the Californian burger (guacamole, applewood smoked bacon and mozzarella), Texan burger (hickory smoked brisket, kansas city sauce and american cheese) and blue cheese burger (blue cheese and bacon). We all agreed that whilst they were tasty, the meat seemed a little dry.With Honest Burgers putting in an appearance just of Shoreditch High Street in the coming months, burgers are flooding the Hoxton/Shoreditch area. One needs to step up. I am not giving up on this one though, I know they can do better and I look forward to going there again and being blown away.",

I think THINK we had Double trouble and the signature burgers, which were fantastic with cold beers.The dogs b*!locks however are the wings...GET WINGS AND HOT ONES! and don't share! It's messy, tasty and will burn you another hole...Nice place, quick easy great for a catch up... please see pics :)",

    "text": "I'd heard very mixed views on this place so couldn't resist going (especially to the the devastator burger).Positives:+ Buffalo wings were very good+ Good selection of beers+ The burger meat was moist and not overcooked. I enjoyed it+ No complaints about service+ I liked the atmosphereOn the other hand....- I feel its a little pricey for what it is. I ended up with a \u00a340+ bill which consisted of half a wing sampler (starter), fries, devastator burger and 2 beers. To be fair if I'd got a smaller burger it would have been \u00a310-12 cheaper but even a regular burger, fries and drink would be \u00a315+ before tip. - My co-diner didn't enjoy their brisket, and I trust their judgement on food matters- Whilst I enjoyed the burger, it wasn't at the level of Meatmarket or 5 guys- The homemade spicy sauces were really watery- Was the mystery sauce in a little tub for my fries or my burger? not sure it added anything, not sure what it was....Overall: I intend to go back here, mostly to actually attempt one of the challenges, but if I'm just in the mood for a good burger I'll head somewhere else.",

Nice cocktails and service, the only thing to mark this down on was the fact they took my bank card like I was a criminal and homeless men kept asking me for spare change. Maybe our fault for sitting outside.",

Whatever you do, don't get the beef rib - which is one giant rib. It tasted ok, but nowhere near as amazing as the burger. I am excited to come back and try their other burgers and milkshakes!",
