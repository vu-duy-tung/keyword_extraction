The crowd is glamorous & well heeled & the shrewdly conceived menu knows its audience perfectly, showcasing luxurious ingredients such as lobster, Dover sole & Wagyu beef in 'truly delicious' dumplings that fans say are 'the best outside Hong Kong'.",

They're pretty boring in my opinion.",

I was skeptical about their food at first, but was genuinely impressed with the authenticity and quality of their dim sum, unlike many other 'Chinese' restaurants in London. As good as the dim sum starters were, it was no where close to the matcha dessert I tried (yes, the one everyone seems to rave about). It was amazing, and no doubt I'm going again just for this. The Lychee Charlotte looks spectacular, but doesn't quite taste really good; far too sour for my liking. All-in-all, I definitely recommend this place for anyone! Good food, great service and even a bar (with a wide range of unique cocktails) makes it a winner in my book.",

Truffle oil is all the rage at this place, the food is absolute artistry, and the cocktails are fantastically, deliciously strong. The dim sum was beautiful in every possible way, and the ribs are the best ones my husband has ever had. I've honestly never had such perfect, gorgeous dim sum. That being said, it still has its flaws. I've only been to one other michelin restaurant that was so unaccommodating in regards to allergies. My husband is allergic to sesame and nuts. The waiter straight-up told us we shouldn't even being dining there with when we have someone with nut and seed allergies. Some time later said waiter returned with about six items that we could order (out of a menu of perhaps a hundred). All of them were wonderful and delicious, but it was a little sad that those were the only items they could give us. The vast majority were vegetarian. On the same note, the only desserts we were able to have due to the allergy restriction were ice creams, which were wonderful but slightly disappointing with all the other wonderful things available.I really, really recommend Yauatcha-- but if you have a friend or family member with nut and/or seed allergies, maybe consider somewhere else.",

You don't get many pieces per order. \u00a0Most traditional Chinese restaurants you'd get 4 pieces. \u00a0At Yauatcha, for the same dim sum order, you only get 3 pieces. Not cool.They also really skimp on the tea. You order tea at a Chinese restaurant they give you a pot of tea with tea leaves in the bottom...then you ask for additional water to brew more tea. \u00a0Their tea pots don't include any tea leaves so you don't get tea leaves in your drink, however, no refills! \u00a0Lame.We dined downstairs and I thought it was quite dark.

So it only made sense that her birthday dinner should involve cakes that look so pretty it would be a crying shame to defile them by eating them (we didn't take much convincing though, no arm-twisting required) and guzzling our collective bodyweight in har gau and venison puffs. Don't do what I did and do a last minute booking (sister decided to change plans on my a day before) or you'll be put upstairs, which is very nice but not quite as pleasing on the beautifully designed basement floor. It's always packed to the rafters from Thursday onwards too, which is great when you want to have raucuous conversation with someone you've not seen in ages, without offending anyone. The service is ultra efficient and attentive. They even top up your tea for you. My view is this: Yauatcha is a treat for the special people in your life. So far the only people who have been taken under my steam are my mum, my sister and an ex with whom I am still friends. So if I take you to a place with a blue glass wall, you've got to be doing something right! I acknowledge the fact that the aforementioned statement is unavoidably political and likely to result in 300 odd- demands from my facebook friends to take them too, or risk being de-listed. I'll take you all when I'm a millionaire. I promise!",

I went with Chinese friends from Beijing who thought that the food was very good. Believe me, they are hardly ever complimentary about Chinese food in the UK! The beefs? Well, the teas are seriously good but at \u00a35 for a small pot they're a bit of a rip off. And the seats. Oh, the agonising kiddy height seats cunningly combined with the massive support under the table that keeps your feet folded under you. I am really short at 5'7\" and I got cramp. STILL ... I would eat there every week if I could afford it. The decor is really uber chic and the take away sweties and tea counters are good.It is not that expensive to lunch off dim sum and they are seriously good.",

Alan Yau won Britain's first Michelin star for his Chinese cooking at London's Hakkasan \u00a0and has opened Yauatcha a couple of years ago.Placed in middle of Soho my first trip there was in a rickshaw straight from a musical. We did not have a reservation and we also risked to miss the last order at 11pm at Saturday. After several left and rights in a labyrinth of narrow streets we arrives safe and sound. Friendly greeted we entered the ground floor of a modern decorated restaurant having our eyes drawn to gold fishes swimming in the display windows. The waiters all are dressed in a uniform designed by Tim Yip, who won an Oscar for art direction in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. During peak hours this restaurant is packed, lucky for us, we did not have to wait for a table and were seated in the chic teahouse and patisserie. I prefer it to the restaurant in the basement as I have to my front colourful patisseries displayed and to my back direct view into the kitchen, where Chinese chefs prepare the dim sums. Ordering several starters to share and some jasmine tea I finally get to try my prawn and date dumplings, which literally melt in my mouth. These Chinese dumplings were among the best I have ever tasted. For those who want to have a little bit more work I recommend the duck wrap.We finally have time to relax and recover from a rather busy and packed Soho, the musical and the bumpy rickshaw ride.",

I had the King crab Shanghai siew long bun (a variation of xiao loan bao). I didn't like their version really much, Hakkasan makes it better. I was excited that they had chicken feet in chlli black bean sauce here. The flavor was more prominent then normal chicken feet dim sum dishes. The best thing I had here was the prawn and beancurd cheung fun. It had such great texture and taste. The outside was soft dumpling texture, but the next inner layer was the asian churro texture (think chalupa) and filled with deliciousness. For dessert I had the warm vanilla rice pudding with banana sorbet and caramelized pineapple. It was disappointing. So I bought some of their macaroons (yuzu chocoloate, coconut, green tea, vanilla, lemon, and chocolate) to go.anitaeat.com",

    "text": "When Yauatcha first opened I didn't understand the hype. And then, I went for dinner one evening.. and ended up going back so often(4x within 2 weeks) I got heartily sick of the food..! ;) But that's not a criticism of the dishes, because.. had I not loved the food, I would not have gone back time and again, bringing different groups of friends there. These days, I still visit.. but less often. I usually bring friends from out-of-town there for dim sum with a twist... if they fancy having Chinese. I like the fact that chefs at Yauatcha have come up with an inventive dim sum menu (and unlike other Chinese restaurants, continue serving dim sum past 5pm). Although, to be fair.. these days, it's not so uncommon to find innovative dim sum dishes at other Chinese restaurants, still.. I go back to Yauatcha specially for some of my favourite steamed baskets: enoki mushroom & prawn dumplings, shitake & duck roll, shanghai spicy dumplings just to name a few. The mango spring roll is sweetly delicious - just be careful not to burn your tongue in your haste to get in a yummy bite. I'd recommend the Singapore Fried Noodles (altho there's no such dish in Singapore!) for back up, just in case you're not full by the end of the meal. Be prepared to pay at least 20% more for dim sum at Yautatcha. In fact, some of their prices are exorbitant but, if you fancy a treat, then by all means, tuck in! I wouldn't recommend ordering ordinary dim sum dishes at Yauatcha (e.g. Har Gau, Siew Mai aka prawn & pork dumpling, Char Siew Pau etc)... because these, you can get at any other Chinese restaurant, and at cheaper prices too. Always go for something special and different at Yauatcha, because.. after all, you're paying for it! I adore their tea cocktails (non-alcoholic).. and always order a Plum Cut Larrisa when I'm there. The Mama-Zhao is nice too, if you fancy a thicker smoothie sort of drink. But everyone who's ever tried my Plum Cut Larrisa insist they want to order that on their next round. So there you go, quench your thirst!",

So fast forward some years and I'm finally seated inside. If I want dim sum, I don't need to pay such an extortionate price. I could just opt for an authentic place down the road in Chinatown. So I opted to try a few plates, unique to Yauatcha instead. Was I impressed? Sadly not that much. Maybe it was because I'd paid double (or even triple) the price for a few dumplings. Or maybe it's because I'd had so much expectation for it for so long. So I guess, if you're looking for decent authentic dimsum, don't go to Yauatcha. If you're looking for a fancy venue, then Yauatcha is for you!",

After trying a place close by with an insane wait, my group was fortunate to stumble upon a free table at exactly the right time. Usually when I think of dim sim, I think of carts coming by or offering delicious, but often unsophisticated looking dumplings and buns. Yauatcha is a dim sum restaurant that made me feel like a grownup (and that is not something that I say lightly). The dishes here were excellent. My group and I ate about 8-10 plates between us, and each item was fantastic. The char siu buns were steamed to perfection. The shrimp and bean curd cheng du...I could have eaten like three plates of that. The dumplings (considering I had about 3 different kinds) were all inhaled. And the turnip cake was the best turnip cake in the history of turnip cakes. The plates are small, but shareable with about 3-4 pieces per dumpling and buns. Topping off our meal with some delicious sake made the entire experience complete.I felt a little out of place with my jeans here, and had I known this is where we were going to end up, I would have opted for something dressier. The wait staff and FOH managers were very accommodating, and would check up on us often. Or suggest another delicious dish for our meal.So many stars. I'm sad I had to stop at five. This place was one of the best meals that I have ever had.",

    "text": "Hip and happening this Chinese restaurant is delicious. Sort of... People with shellfish allergies beware, as most dishes served here are with oyster sauce, even dishes that look vegetarian, and what first looks like an extensive and exciting menu limits those people with shellfish allergies down to a a measly few dishes to choose from. And when I say measly, I mean you can count the selection on one hand. This is important to note as one in our party was allergic and this meant that person had little to eat. Everybody else feasted. And the cuisine while distinctively Chinese had a modern approach which made for a truly tasty experience. Pork belly with truffles... foie gras, duck, and delightful pumpkin dim sum shaped into little pumpkins were divine. We came for desserts, however we were disappointed as by the time we were finished with our meal, the tempting dessert selections we had seen upon entering the restaurant were nearly all sold out and we were left with little to choose from. So, that was sort of the theme of the night here at Yauatcha: So much to tempt, so little actually available. The decor was trying too hard with its fish aquariums and Asian inspired seating. The seats themselves were very close to the ground and people were too close and on top of each other. My chair was next to one of the pillars and I had to sit a bit sideways and nearly on top of the table, so it was a bit uncomfortable. And yes, a bit noisy. Waitstaff too could have been a bit more attentive and not so rushed. Its a shame really as it is a fun place, great for small groups of friends. I think it definitely merits a try, as what was good, was tasty, but perhaps avoid Saturday night and the weekends.",

Yauatcha is more a fusion sort of dim sum. Everything we had was typical chinese dim sum but they were just presented so clean and tasted mediocre. My parents remarked that we could get better dim sum for way cheaper back in San Francisco. I enjoyed all of the dishes we got, but I believe that there was nothing special about any of them. All of the plates were remarkably tiny sized for the amount we paid for it. The only dish I thought was worth checking out were the Prawn & Beancurd Cheung Fun. Oh and this place is the slowest service I have ever experienced before.. It takes forever to get anything done. Food comes out slow, waiters never seem to see you, water takes forever to come to the table. Oh and make sure you ask for tap water or they'll charge you for still water. I would recommend just coming here for drinks and desserts. We tried the Raspberry Delice. It looked better than it tasted. The lychee ice cream that came with it was much more delicious and unique.",

The service has always been impeccable; especially on my last visit where glasses of water would appear on our table as if by magic. Our waitress (each time) was only too happy to explain some of the dishes to us as they were vaguely described on the menu. Our food always arrived promptly and of course tasted delicious! The decor is beautiful inside leaving your jaw ajar for the first 10 minutes as you take in the surroundings. Plus, the dessert display upstairs makes it incredibly difficult to resist!After tasting a variety of dishes on the menu with each one as mouthwatering as the next, I know I will be paying yet another visit for my dim sum fix as the menu is quite large I (and you) want to try everything.",

    "text": "I've been going on and off pretty much since it's opened and it's retained its quality. Of the dozen places I've been to in London this is by far the best and the only one that comes close to what I'm used to in Hong Kong and Singapore, although I have yet to try Hakkasan which is supposed to be on the level.Yauatcha brings modern cooking techniques and interesting ingredients to dim sum. The venison puff is a textbook butter pastry with French, rather than Cantonese techniques. The parcels (sorry, \"spinach prawn dumplings\") would not be out of place in a Vietnamese kitchen and are also reminiscent of greek leaf rice parcels. There are a few twists on classics, such as the pumpkin crystal dumpling which plays pumpkin's softer texture against just a hint of crunchy water chestnut (expected) and the oily nasal nuttiness of pine nuts (unexpected). Since the classics are done well without using the usual bulk frozen quality items, they taste different: the prawn and deep fried tofu cheung fun was crispier and more flavourful than expected although it's a shame they hold on to the sauce pot after pouring. The kitchen team here has taste and knowledge and the cooking is consistent. I like it, authenticity gets boring after a while.They have always had amazing desserts but having not had one in 3 years I cannot comment on whether quality has been maintained, only point out that many tables were ordering some and they still look very pretty and skilled.The restaurant itself is still claustrophobic downstairs, although it feels less packed than when it first opened years ago. There is also less queue, although it is still full. The audience, visually, seems half Chinese, and sounds mainland, probably a good sign, from large groups of men to lone diners enjoying a taste of home. The waitstaff has become more European.Prices feel much higher (4-5 GBP for the cheapest punnets), maybe I'm not used to London eye wateringly high food prices anymore, they are high at all the yum cha we tried this trip. I forgot that the \"pot\" did not have leaves and you have to pay twice as much if you want to be able to re-brew. One of the many ways in which your bill can skyrocket here, especially if you are used to tea being included.The other way in which it does not feel like yum cha is that you are somewhat rushed every step of the way. The seating is uncomfortably low, the space between tables limited, the space noisy (downstairs especially), your legs hit the table legs, and they start cleaning your table before you've even finished your pot of tea. But I expect this considering the location, fame and long queue. If they let people linger 3 hours there wouldn't be any tables for walk ins and the prices would be even higher.Well, sometimes you want to have some yum cha that does not taste of MSG and frozen prawn and this is the place to go for it in London. Maybe I should try Hakkasan some time but old habits die hard.",

    "text": "Going to Yauatcha was an exciting prospect after hearing so much about the restaurant. The experience did not disappoint. Dining at Yauatcha is an adventure. I really liked the ambience of the restaurant downstairs. There are enclaves in the walls with electric candles so the room is dark but candlelit. There is a long acquarium strip with fish brightly lit on the customer facing side of the bar. My date for the evening suggested that the noise from the music might be a problem for some diners, but it wasnt for us. In fact I enjoyed the level of noise as it gave us some privacy and also added to the ambience of the room. You can see the kitchen through frosted glass so you get a sense of how fast things are moving in the kitchen, which makes sense because the service is excellent 5/5. We ordered mushroom dim sum and prawn shui mai with chicken to begin with and these were served seamlessly right after one another. Next we were served crispy aromatic duck with pancakes and hoisin sauce. Again the service was elegant and prompt. After this we ordered egg fried rice and kung pao chicken which was excellent. The chicken was delicious and I could have eaten much more! The chilies were quite hot but not too hot to eat, apart from one. For dessert I resisted my primary urge to order the maccarons and instead ordered the chocolate pebble which was enjoyable. I could see that a lot of thought had gone into the dessert's construction and different textures as you might expect from this Michelin starred restaurant. However for me the dessert was not outstanding nor delicious. I am certainly a fan of Yauatcha and can't wait to visit again! I can see why it has earned its Michelin star as I found eating there an adventure and a delight.",

The jook (porridge) was okay, but nothing to write home about, as were the rest of the dishes, including the French macarons, which is supposedly one of the features that sets this place apart.In sum: food bad, service bad, atmosphere not great.

Now, having tried Hakkasan I didn't really have high hopes, but it rocked my taste buds to the core.We usually go for dim sum (lunch) and have on occasion been for dinner. Between three of us we order about 10 dishes and drinks which only comes out to about \u00a325 each. Some may think that is extortionate for dim sum, but how many places my friend, can you get perfect venison -melt-in-you-mouth pastry puffs? None. I've seen that Royal China have tried to add them to their menu - but they just cannot compete.Other dishes we order frequently are the pork and chive dumplings, shanghai soup dumplings and all other regulars, think pork buns, sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf etc. I have to admit I come here about once or twice a month, that is how much I love it. Service used to be a lot worse but I've seen some improvement in their waiting staff. The hostesses on the other hand could be a little friendlier. I also like, that unlike Royal China, you can make a booking and not have to show up at 11am on a Saturday morning just to get a table. As I've said before, hands down, best dim sum in London - and coming from someone who lived in Hong Kong for 18 yrs of my life, I am serious about my dim sum.",

I really think its just people saying look at this posh place and watch me drop my life savings down the poop shoot. \u00a0It was good but my wallet is much much thinner after the meal than before. \u00a0I say go there if your money is buring holes in your pockets.",

It's not Chinatown as we know it but rather some kind of newly minted sparkling 21st century version of an old Chinese favorite.We called in at 7.00 on a Sunday and we were given a table for 2. The tables are close together and as it was quietish, I requested a four-top for us as they were all empty. The hostess kindly seated us on a larger table after checking her table plan. Our waitress was excellent. I had an idea of what we wanted as I have had Dim sum before but she was great at giving us suggestions. We ended up ordering six dishes all recommended by her and I was very happy with all of them. The cocktail I had, called Lalu, was gorgeous and full of lime and zesty flavours. My favorite dim sum was the Szechaun Beef parcel and the prawn Cheung Fun. Our bill was a \u00a370 for 6 dim sum, a cocktail and a beer, 2 espressos and dessert. It was all amazing and I will be back.",

    "text": "I'm not sure how I feel about this place. I've grew up on dim sum and have had it in HK, Taiwan, China, LA, SF, NYC, etc. I went on a Sunday morning with a friend right before the afternoon rush. We got there about 12:30 and it was still pretty empty. Upon walking in, I felt disoriented. It was sleek and sexy and modern-- totally not what I expect from a yum cha place. They also have a macaroon display in the window, which I don't quite understand (since when did macaroons become asian?). Service: Pretty good, they tended to be above average for London standards.Food: It's different. It's not bad. It's actually quite good. It just doesnt really look or taste much like all the other yum cha I've ever had. Pricey though-- 5 quid (at least) for a tiny dish with three siao mai in it. (But I shouldn't complain, since I wasn't paying). I have to say though, I'm pretty impressed with the tea. I can't remember which open we got, but it was light, refreshing, hot, and well prepared.I guess it must be good since there were other Asian people there, but I still kind of like my old school yum cha/dim sum places better. The prices are really something else too. Call me a creature of habit.That said, if someone takes you here for free, it's still definitely worth it.",

Blah. \u00a0And the prawns with jasmin tea whatever was overcooked.Also liked the tea list. \u00a0I think they need a tea sommelier though with their overwhelming list of team.Unfortunately I was unimpressed with the desserts. \u00a0Yes they were really yummy BUT it is a CHINESE RESTAURANT! \u00a0WHERE THE HELL ARE THE CHINESE DESSERTS? \u00a0By all means, update them, fusion them, deconstruct them. \u00a0I DON'T CARE what you do but totally westernized dessert is completely unacceptable. \u00a0I want desserts where you can describe it normally in chinese, since you decided to do it with the rest of your freaking menu. \u00a0Here are just a few ideas:1) Mango served on a coconut zabione with black rice ice cream2) Giant Ball of Ton Yuin- but still make it taste delicious- that is very challenging. OR deep fried peanut ton yuin served with chocolate dressing kinda like chinese profiterols3) Melon and Coconut Tapioca Pudding El Bulli Style4) A Kinda Banofee pie with aduki bean instead of banana?The world's your oyster dude. \u00a0Stop being cautious and boring!If you are going to take your famous cake counter away; you might as well go all the way and be chinese about it and serve asian desserts.I am actually pissed enough to consider putting back down to 3 stars but I guess at least the desserts were really yummy.PS Why were some of the chinese characters in traditional and some in simplified? \u00a0Have you not heard of proof readers?",

Lots of advertising producers sharing a bottle or two and gassing about which director messed up which job and which producer copped off with which first AD. But frankly it's all the better for it!Tightly packed together tables in a dark buzzy basement with low ceilings and house music oozing out of the speakers. Waiters who look like they came out of Sex And The City. It's fun, why knock it?And the food isn't bad either. A couple of legendary dishes like the venison puffs and the tea smoked ribs. I had both again and they were as usual delicious.We wandered in on the off chance at about 11pm on a Sat night, and although it was packed and buzzing, they were able to accommodate us in no time which I think deserves the extra star I'm giving it. The menu has plenty to choose from and I applaud the authenticity of much of it. (They have congee if you dare order. Yuck.) You might think it's style over substance but actually there's a lot of good food too just like their sister place Hakasaan.I've had my battles in there like the time we over ordered and they wouldn't provide us with a doggy bag to take the rest home. Looked at me like I was mad when I made that suggestion. Certainly not something ladies who lunch often ask for. They are all skinny as a rake anyway.But you aren't fleeced for the experience. It's the sort of place you feel will cost a fortune because of the smart surroundings but actually if you pick wisely it's not that bad. You certainly feel like you've had a run for your money when you roll out of there anyhow.All in all, for a lively, stylish, buzzy experience in the middle of soho in cool surroundings with beautiful gossiping people, you can't really go wrong if you get a table here.",

They have great selection of teas too and the smoothie fruity teas are my favourites.If I'm craving for a quick dimsum fix, I'll go to Chinatown. If I'm in the mood for better quality dimsum (esp for dinner time as most restaurants in china town stop serving dimsum from 5pm) and nicer atmosphere and staff who treat me like their customer I will go to yauatcha.Make sure you make reservation I you wanna go here for dinner on the weekends, or prepare to wait for apprx 1 hour.

    "text": "Definitely my favourite place in London, even better than its older brother Hakkasan.I need to admit I don't really like Chineese food, but Yauatcha is an exception.All the times I have been here, I always asked the waiter to bring a dim sum selection (they can tailor to your taste if you tell them what you like) as starters: my favourite is the white roll with mushrooms, don't know the name though. Also try the crispy duck salad, is really tasty.As main, there is only one option for me: the crispy duck! It is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G, litteraly my flatmate and me have been addicted to it for months last winter...it is tasty, the meat is tender, the sauce is great, pancakes are good...the best main you can have here. All the other stuff are pretty good too, but this one deverves to be tried at least once. You might think that Asian places don't serve good desserts, but here you have some delicious ones: my favourite is the Coconut Charlotte, but also the chocolate delice is very good. There are some very nice cocktails as well, fruity and colourful, and a good wine selection, even if I always end up taking the asian beer (I think Sapporo is the one I like better).The place is very nice, the street level floor is elegant and clean, but the best part is the lower ground floor with a blue lighting and a huge acquarium at the bar: Since the first time I came, I felt like to be in a \"movie restaurant\", the places where the characters usually meet for a date or a chat in the movies.The only problem is that it is so popular these days that finding a table and even making a reservation is a nightmare, over the weekend tables are booked since mid week! They offer various time slots, at 6.30, 8.30 and 10.30 for dinner and if you are lucky and call on the same day you can find something at 6.30 only...I can't wait to go back to London to come here again!",

Not sure what to order, we shared steamed chicken dumplings, grilled vegetable dumplings and beef ho fun noodles. The food was served quickly and was simply the best i've eaten in a while. I also had a lime and passion fruit ice tea which washed it all down nicely. All together the meal was \u00a315 each including drinks which i think is a reasonable amount for a lunch date.

    "text": "My first visit to Yauatcha was more than 7 years ago when Londoners were yet to get their fair share of upscale Chinese food. \u00a0Dim sum lunch was usually taken hastily in one of the tacky eateries in China Town and there was almost no place offering authentic Chinese cuisines and western standard service and decor. Against that backdrop, Yauatcha was an easy standout. \u00a0I was particularly impressed with the quality of the dim sum. \u00a0Coming from Hong Kong, where one can get quality dim sum aplenty, I was always skeptical of these new age chinese restaurants but Yauatcha was the rare few that delivered quality with just the right amount of innovation that justified the steeper prices it fetched. \u00a0Times have changed though but my recent visits to Yauatcha have been disappointing. \u00a0First off, food was still of consistent quality. My favorites include the venison puff (venison in a slightly sweet puff pastry case where in the usual case it would have been bbq pork), the three style mushroom cheung fun (a steamed rice roll stuffed with mushroom) and the jasmine tea smoked rib. There is also a good selection of tea and desserts. \u00a0However, there are multiple things that were problematic. First and foremost, service was slow and inattentive, and frequently I seem to get the \"dont-seem-to-care-less\" attitude from everyone working there. \u00a0Friends have received the same treatment. Just not the kind of service you would expect at this price point. \u00a0The interiors also look a bit worn and old now, maybe time for some touchups? \u00a0If you want quality dimsum at reasonable prices, you are better off going to one of the Royal China's around town. \u00a0And if fusion is what you like, there are plenty of choices around. One good thing though is that you can always get a table at Yauatcha, if you have the cash and time to spare.",

My parents wanted to go for dim sum and I thought of trying somewhere new so a friend recommended Yauatcha after reading raving reviews about it on Yelp.Everything about this restaurant screams modern and trendy from the design of the menu to the ambiance. Looking at the restaurant from the outside in, you would have thought it to be a cafe to enjoy a hot beverages with \u00a0a variety of desserts. Traditional would not be a word that I would use to describe this establishment. Even Debussy, Clair de Lune that was playing in the background was given an upbeat electronic remix. I didn't mind the music as I thought it was fitting to the surroundings but I really didn't like the seats. I am about 180cm tall (5'9\") and found the seats to be awkward and uncomfortable to sit in as the chairs seemed to be lower to the ground than usual. Anyway we order a selection of dim sum and waited for out food to arrive. The dim sum was good but not amazing especially when you factor in the price. In comparison to a typical Chinese restaurant in China town that severs dim sum, you are paying anything between \u00a33 to \u00a35 more. Safe to say that you are paying extra for the aesthetics appeal. It is also worth noting that you don't get free refills of the Jasmin tea. So overall I would say I prefer dining at more traditional Chinese restaurant than a modernised one hence the 3 star ranking that I gave but whenever I need to wine and dine some one then this would be one of the places that I would consider bringing them to.",

    "text": "Have had 2 visits in the last week to this highly rated restaurant. A week ago I visited with 2 friends without a reservations and we were escorted to a table behind the staircase adjacent to a register being actively used by multiple waiters. After we received our drinks we were bumped repeatedly and asked to be reseated. The manager was very gracious about moving us to a table in the larger downstairs room with a view of the huge fish tank. Dinner proceeded uneventfully and we enjoyed our meals. Tonight visited the restaurant with friends who had not been there before but this time I called to make a reservation and asked to be seated in the large room with a view of the fish tank. I was really surprised when we were seated at the exact table behind the stairs I had been given a week earlier. This time I immediately asked for another table and told them I was assured that there would be no problem sitting in the large dining room. We sat a short while and then were given another table by the kitchen but improved. Then came issues with the service. We received one of our appetizers. Then we received another. Then we got our three meals. We finished them and Then we received another appetizer. Then we requested the bill and then along with the bill came soup we had ordered earlier. We thought the late appetizer and soup had been forgotten. Then as we were paying my one friend said \"there is a bug in my beer\" \u00a0I looked and saw a sizable live bug waving around in the beer. I wondered how many might have been in my meal. We won't go back.",

Yauatcha filled that void completely. One of my favourite Dim Sum style London Chinese of the past couple of years. Whenever I'm back in town I love to pay a visit here. Like it's many teas, the food is to be savoured and enjoyed. Recommend the Prawn Shui mai with chicken, Shanghai soup dumplings, Crispy Duck roll, Chilli Squid and Jasmine Tea Smoke Ribs. For tea I recommend the Anxi Tie Guan Yin and the Silver Needle White. Take your time and enjoy their tea selection!",

Also, service was pretty good, it got slow once we ordered but the initial order taking was prompt, they also were very helpful in elaborating what was in certain dishes as we had some special diet restrictions during our visit.I can't remember everything we ordered but here are few that I really liked:Tea: White Silver Needle TeaFood:Chive and Prawn DumplingSteamed Vegetable DumplingKing crab Shanghai siew long bun Hot & Sour Soup with shredded chickenSo if I enjoyed it why only 3 stars, the slow service after we initially sat down it took forever to get water, then after we finally got to order, it took forever for our drinks to come (at least 10-15 minutes). \u00a0It was an unfortunately long and exhausting meal as everything took a long wait. \u00a0It took them 20 minutes to bring the tea and all the waiter could say is that he forgot to put the order in -- that's inexcusable considering the prices you pay to eat here.",

Yauatcha is very popular so be ready to share your experience with hundreds of other guests and to occasionally rub elbows with the customers at the neighbouring table. Anyway, I was happy with my dim sums and the service was kind and attentive. It turns out that Yauatcha has a Michelin star and maybe it deserves it, but if you're looking for dim sums there's a couple of similarly good (non-starred) options in China Town.",

Of particular note the Chueng Fun of any variety - There is something about a perfectly cooked battered prawn inside a warm blanket of steamed rice noodle that is ecstatic to the senses. Also the steamed lobster roll and Venison puffs and spicy pork wonton were incredible.

The crispy duck was crispy only because it was overcooked, and its pancakes too sticky and thick. It's a lovely room, but I was amazed to read afterwards that it has a Michelin star.

Yauatcha tends to draw mixed reactions from people, but the great majority agree: Yauatcha rocks!!My absolute favorite dishes are the Shark's fin Hot & Sour Soup (just the thought of it makes my glands flow), the Shitake & Duck Roll, the Spinach Cube (stunning. stunning.), and the hand pulled noodles with shimeji mushrooms. Give me three of each of these and I'm happy and stuffed.Bear in mind, this is not a traditional dim sum or high street chinese restaurant. The dishes are, for the most part, variations of the oldies. A lot of the dim-sum dishes would be familiar to you, but this is a menu worth taking time over and trying as many of those that appeal to you. Chances are you won't be disappointed with the flavors of the dishes. The ingredients are obviously of the highest quality and kitchen consistently produces the same high standard every time we've been there. Added to which the restaurant (downstairs) has a very smooth decor; subtle, warm and inviting. The bathrooms are pretty slick too...Be sure to try the delicious teas (white tea... mmm-MMM!).",

    "text": "Wow. Wow. Wow. Located in the Soho district of London you will find Yauatcha, another one of Alan Yau's masterpiece restaurants. One of my mates who resides in London was nice enough to intro me to the restaurant by meeting me there for lunch, it was no doubt THE best dim sum restaurant I have EVER been to in my life, thanks Si. The d\u00e9cor of this restaurant was simply stunning, so much so that I can not even do it justice explaining it here, I'll have to leave it at that, seriously. I started with a bowl of Hot & Sour soup with shredded chicken for $6.50 quid. It was truly what I expected, a smooth sweet medley of flavours with a slight hint of tartness (doubt that's a word), one of the finer soups I've tried. They also had shark fin soup which immediately put a foul taste in my mouth althought I didn't even order it, I HATE everything about shark fin soup and that is a completely different discussion. I am glad to know that Alan Yau has removed his 40 pound shark fin soup dish from his world famous restaurant Hakkesan. Next from the menu I tried the Pork & Prawn Shumai. It was delectably different from the traditional Pork Shumai that I am used to in the GTA. The texture of this particular dumpling was just perfect with the right amount of meat. It didn't blow me out of the water, but it was damn good. Next I had a dish which re-shaped my discerning palette for good. It was a baked venison puff, the best dim sum item that has ever graced my mouth. The texture of this puff was perfectly flaky, the filling was of a richer darker meat, and the sweet taste was so good I thought I was dreaming. The puffs came x 3, but I could have done x 25. \u00a0Aside from Yauatcha there is also Alan Yau's Hakkesan which I briefly mentioned above. Hakkesan is considered by many to be one of the best restaurants in the world, and I am somewhat disappointed that I was not able to hit it up while I was in London. However, I really can't picture the quality of food and d\u00e9cor being all that much better than Yauatcha, at most I can see it being on par which says a lot! I just wanted to mention Hakkesan because if you are in London I would highly recommend both of these restaurants if you are a Dim Sum enthusiast. I will warn you the prices are very high averaging at least $6-7 quid per dish, a big change for me because the dishes here in the GTA run for $3-4 CAD, but more than worth it. Only after I came back from my visit to London did I come to learn that Yauatcha had gained 2 Michelin starts since its inception in 2004. If you don't live in the UK, book your vacation now.",

HOWEVER the staff was quite rude about stating their policies(they \"never\" allowed take-away - not true) But the main sore point was the fact when the bill came, I paid in cash over the amount(did not have exact change) - now the gratuity of 12.5% had ALREADY been added to the bill's total amount. I waited and waited until finally asked where my change was - she looked confused and walked away. I then asked the manager for the receipt to check the amount I gave them, again he said NOTHING about returning my change. - NOTE TO ALL - BE VERY WARY - I think that they feel that they \"deserved the extra tips....I definitely will NOT be returning to their establishment!",

Congratulations. A few years ago that was one of the toughest things to do here in London. The night-time 25thCentury Dim Sum bar with it's aquarium-filled cocktail bar and 1 Michelin Star was the talk of the town. The Dim Sum craze began here with Yau's creativity, coolness and excellent design.It helped that they had edible GOLD-painted dumplings too!Those bling-bling dumplings have sadly left the menu but plenty of other extravangances exist and the prices can rocket sky high for some small dishes. And if you are trying the world-class teas and masterpiece petit fours upstairs then you could be forgiven for thinking they screwed up and just converted prices one-to-one from Chinese Yuan they are so high.But don't let that fool you. Yauatcha is the cheapest place I've ever had a filling Michelin-starred meal. If you come in a three (3 is the magic Dim Sum number) then you can stuff yourself with many dishes and even have cocktails and quite easily leave without spending more than 30 each. That's pretty magical considering you'll not eat at many places so obviously cool and 25th Century.It's sounding like the perfect date place too, isn't it?Well it almost is... but think of all those awkward moments when little dumpling number 3 is lying there and you have to decide who gets it. Take my advice and do your dating mid-afternoon with the tea and cakes upstairs. Yau's Taiwanese tea-expert wife is the lord of this section and this lady gets it right - easily the best Asian teas in town.So why is my once favourite restaurant in the world only getting four stars? Because of the system... the booking, the time allocation and the..------- ---------- ---------- --------- ---------- --------- --------- --------- ------- YAUATCHA: \" TIME'S UP, please move on now! \"ME: \" ;__; \"",

I'm not experienced enough with dim sum - although I've enjoyed my fair share - to know just how experimental or creative it can be without departing from its essence or origins. But Yauatcha appears to both retain the familiar core of dim sum and push the boundaries of taste and presentation. At Yauatcha you could dine out on presentation alone: they take visual beauty very seriously. Each element is artfully combined to play colour against texture against size and shape. But most memorably, the clever an unusual combinations of basic ingredients (pork, prawns, scallops, soft-shelled crab, for example) with subtle spices and seasonings, encased in truly world-class pastry, amount to a sparkling dim sum fantasia beyond reasonable expectation. The highlight of the afternoon was quite possibly a lovely, moist, spongy, buttery pastry sprinkled with sesame seeds with a venison (yes, venison) stuffing that just oozed with sinful suggestiveness. Jade dumplings, so-called because of their green hue, stuffed with wild mushrooms were another inspired marvel. The tea menu is equally staggering in its breadth - we practically got high on so many delicate, aromatic teas. And all of this happens under the watchful eye of slightly dopey goldfish and miniature carp in a long fishtank. Service is somewhat erratic and indifferent, but when the dim sum starts flowing, coming at you in waves of colour, you are past caring. This is a damn fine restaurant.",

It is pretty funky and trendy in here which means it is on the more expensive side but the food is certainly worth it.I have visited a couple of times now for special occasions, and the place is perfect for cosy dates! I would request to be seated downstairs in the main room if you are looking for a bit of atmosphere as they have a beautiful sky effect with gorgeous lighting.There is also a fabulous range of oriental inspired cocktails but they tend not to taste very alcoholic (even though they most certainly are!) so it is worth keeping an eye on how many you order! Upstairs there is also a patisserie which is lovely to visit for tea. I would definitely recommend booking in advance as the place can get very busy.",

Since we were in the chinatown/soho area, we figured we can try Lond's version of dim sum. After some yelping, I came across Yauatcha. Hearing that they have a Michelin star, I had high expectations when I visited. The restaurant was huge, having two floors and also a sweets/dessert station. My family and I sat downstairs. The restaurant was beautifully decorated that was modern with an asian twist. After looking over the menu, we ordered some cocktails and a few dishes. The dishes are small for a dim sum place but it was expected since this was more of a fancier take on dim sum. Everything that we ordered was delicious! Also the drinks were great. I the only thing was the price. I figured that the price reflected not the food but the owner and status of the restaurant. Overall, I would definitely recommend to anyone who is not from San Francisco.",

    "text": "Where to begin on Yauatcha? I want to give it 5 stars, as the aspects that were good, were excellent. But the bits that weren't good were pretty darn poor. It's worth a visit, but probably not a return - unless you're coming back for dessert. So, can we say three and a half stars?I've heard mixed things about the staff, but I have to say we didn't have any problems. They were very nice, accommodating, etc. Our main waiter was a bit hard to track down so we ended up waiting a bit longer than we would have wanted to order some things, and one of the staff tried clearing away a plate while someone was still eating off it, but other than that, it was fine. Foodwise, the wagyu beef puffs and chinese chive and prawn shumai were big hits, and we ordered a second round of each. I loved the scallop shumai (but be warned: I burned the roof of my mouth and am still feeling it a day later). I didn't try it, but the beef shumai ws a big letdown for everyone at the table, as was the pork and prawn shaumai. I don't think we finished either order (which says something, as the portions are quite small - 3 pieces of beef shumai, for example, when you'd get 4 for the same price at other places). I had the seafood dumpling soup, which was very very good. I loved the broth (and they served it with a bit of sauce to put in, which really made it taste incredible. But, again, price is a concern: \u00a36.70 for a tiny tureen of soup with one dumpling. We also got a couple of mains to share: the quarter duck and the stir fry pepper chili seafood with asparagus. The duck was alright. A bit dry, but decent. The seafood dish was a definite disappointment. The scallops and shrimp were cooked very well, as was the asparagus, but the dominant flavour was salt. It was a really shame, as we loved the seafood-based chili sauce they put on the table with the shumai, and hoped the seafood chili dish would be just as good. The jasmine rice we got with it was a tad overcooked, too. For dessert we got a raspberry delice to share, which was amazing. Imagine a bit of lychee surrounded chocolate mouse shaped like a rose and covered in a velvety raspberry coating. So rich and so beautiful. And definitely something to return for - everyone absolutely loved it. The rest of the food? Well, most of the dim sum was a hit, if that helps?Overall cost was \u00a3170 for four (though with only two \"main\" dishes) which included 2 beers and 2 harder drinks (vodka/whiskey on the rocks, no cocktails). For that price I would have thought we walked out stuffed and/or overwhelmed with how good the food was. We did neither.",

Now this was very good value, and it's true, the dim sum are a twist on the original and prepared with exceptional care (truffle oil in spring rolls?? it works.)Second time I went, we had more standard items off the menu. The dishes tasted good, with obviously quality ingredients, but not overwhelmingly different from the equivalent dish you'd get at a regular chinese restaurant. Maybe it's just me, but perhaps it's hard to get subtle, inventive \"haut cuisine\" type flavors in Chinese food. I'd go back, especially for the tasting menu, but what I love about Chinese food wasn't totally there in the main dishes.A good plus though - great tea selection, and if you order a few, you can really compare and contrast.",

    "text": "Went for dinner and ordered the dim sum. It was delicious. The presentation and flavors were on point. I was def impressed as I've always thought of dim sum as greasy and a bit heavy and the innards always ground up in some mystery combination. Here, it was actual pieces of vegetables and meats that you can see and distinguish...and taste! I would mark for 4 stars, but I felt that 3 pieces per dim sum for the price was a rip off. Also, when you order a pot of tea, you don't get hot water top up. Gotta pay for another (small) pot. Awesome. The ambiance was very nice. I'd say it has a better decor than Hakkasan. I'd revisit this place on special occasions when it warrants me to splurge on dim sum.",

    "text": "Yauatcha is a 1 Michelin starred dim sum tea house. \u00a0Definitely upscale and posh, but didn't give it a 5 stars due to the service. \u00a0They try to be very upscale in service, so they literally whisper at you...this only works if you're in a very quiet restaurant. \u00a0This place is more happening and upbeat which naturally turns into loud in volume. \u00a0You must speak up people! \u00a0They also need more training in being more observant...there were more than too many times they walked away without looking. \u00a0They probably solely get the Michelin for their food, because food is absolutely stunning in its presentation, quality, and taste. \u00a0The desserts are so pretty here too!The two of us ordered the set menu for two people which came with the following: Blue swimmer crab salad with sesame dressing and Asian vegetables Venison Puff - flaky pastry filled with yummy venison. Seafood dumpling in supreme stock - Fish maw dumpling! So good! Great broth and exciting texture of the fish maw in the dumpling!  Poached Peking chicken dumpling - Excellent Har gau - very nice skin with excellent shrimp inside Pork and prawn shui mai - Excellent Three style mushroom cheung fun - clean and woodsy mushroom taste with excellent skin! Fried chilli squid - So yummy!! Perfectly fried and little Thai chili peppers mixed in the loose batter gives it a good kick!! \u00a0There were also toasted coconuts which made it so fragrant and yummy! Crispy aromatic duck 1/4 - Quarter of a duck fried to perfection with inside meat juicy. The server shreds the meat for us so that we can make our own wrap. Chinese vegetable - crisp, sweet, excellent baby bok choy.Then two of my kids ordered additional from the a la cart menu:  Lobster Dumpling - Lobster dumpling with tobiko caviar with ginger and shallot. Yes! They're yummy! Pork and preserved egg congee - really nice and well cooked. \u00a0Great flavor! Char Sui Bao - So good! \u00a0First note, you smell a fragrant but subtle rose. \u00a0Then you bite into this fluffy bun and taste the amazing char sui inside! \u00a0I asked why do I smell rose, and they told me that the flour they use is \"rose flour!\" \u00a0Amazing!! Scallop Siu Mai - Whole entire scallop per dumpling! \u00a0WOW!After all that food, we were stuffed, but we had to try the desserts, because they're sooooo beautiful! Raspberry and lychee rose - velvety and amazing! \u00a0Looks like a beautiful hat with a edible silver leaf on top! \u00a0Mmmmmm Green apple cake - so tangy and yummy and lovely! \u00a0Gelatin on top and buttery pie bottom. \u00a0The apple looks real! Chocolate orange macaron. \u00a0OK this is the only item that's not out of this world...only because I'm used to the finest...Ladur\u00e9e and Pierre Herme. \u00a0But still good.We also had 4 pots of tea (there's no refill on water) and their pots are personal size, as well as 4 bottles of still water.The bill was US $233, which's pretty steep for dim sum...but it was an experience to remember!",

Something better than the cheap DimSum shops that sells SiuMai @ 3 for $1.50 (USD). Bellow is a list of what we ordered.Tea Smoked Ribs - It was tasty and falls right off the bone. However, it has no tea flavor, false advertisement. it is not different than those BBQ Ribs you find at your local Chinese BBQ shop for a fraction of the price.Pork SiuMai - It tasted and looked exactly like those you can find at your local dimsum shop for a fraction of the price.Beef Rice Roll - I actually loved this dish. They used Sukiyaki grade beef instead of the traditional minced beef. the only dish I enjoyed. Chicken Feet - what can i say, it was chopped in half, not an whole feet. too many small broken bones that irritated the sh*** out of me. XLB - I prefer this dish at either DTF or any other XLB shop. The atmosphere was a miss in my opinion. The waiter sat us at the street level where a low table paired with small/low chairs, very similar to those you see in child care places.",

There are more special and better presented unique Dim Sum such as the Shanghai Blues restaurant in Holborn which offers similar fare with live musicAlso value is pretty poor. The tea is by the pot and super pricy. Don't expect refills here. Dishes start from around \u00a35 upward.

Great range of orientally inspired cocktails and not that overpriced if you watch what you order! Good service, occasionally patchy at busy times though.

And be careful when you book a table for dinner because the restaurant is on two floors - ground floor and downstairs/basement. Each has a very different atmosphere and decor. Downstairs is darker, more intimate and, I think, more atmospheric. I booked what I thought was a table in the basement (I'm sure I said \"downstairs\") but we ended up on the ground floor. The manager said, \"People get confused between the two floors. It happens alot!\"",

First you have to make a reservation, which is fine I would expect nothing less from a good restaurant. After we were seated it was probably at least 20 minutes before the waiter came over to take our drinks order. It was not busy at all, the rest of the evening was a waiting game. I found the whole experience quite rude when they tell you that you have 90 minutes for dinner.... not sure exactly what happens if you go over your limit... and your waiter isn't at all bothered with doing his job. It made the evening almost stressful. Don't come to Yauatcha hungry or thirsty because you may not see food or water for quite some time. However when you do finally get your food, not that it is worth the wait but it is soooo good. Yauatcha is an experience go for that not to satisfy an appetite.",

Fantastic for gifts and surprising that special someone. The chocolate/jasmin cake I chose looked beautiful and tasted devine.. quite bitter chocolate, light as a feather, and sweet enough to be a dreamy desert. And we must not forget those little macaroons, these brightly coloured gorgeous creations waiting to be gobbled up one by one.

Basically, these guys are making out like bandits on the drinks margin. switched to beer (one choice, small bottle, 5.50, OK) and the food was mediocre to decent, with no wow dish in our whole order, though some were decent enough. my advice, drop by for a few dim sum orders, enjoy the vibe, and don't expect much from the food. if you want a 10 quid milk shake, they can oblige, and you certainly won't have a hangover even if you are rich or foolish enough to order 10 of them. nice looking space and crowd though.",

You can sit downstairs in the restaurant but I like upstairs as that is where you get the best patisseries ever; like a coffee and absinthe cake to die for.

Dim sum dishes were roughly \u00a34-7 and featured 3-4 shui Mai or dumplings depending on what you order. Noodle and meat dishes can range for \u00a312-16 so the restaurant's food is a little on the pricey side.Overall this is a good place to take your date, get together with some friends for a drink, or to get some dinner with friends.

Honestly, everything I had was really good so just be open minded and order something you've never had before and surprise yourself :). Each person would need to order about 3 items. It's not the cheapest dim sum but it is well worth the money.",

It doesn't look like a restaurant outside though through the window we could see it was a bakery.We hadn't made a booking so they gave us a table for three people and said we had two hours.We ordered various dim sum, which are quite expensive and only really a treat, rather than somewhere you would go every Sunday like we normally have done in Birmingham!! The waitress told us we had ordered enough as they don't do take out boxes! Okay we got told lol Some of the dim sum was nice and some were too unusual for my taste. It is stylish and an Instagrammers heaven ! My friend paid so I don't know how much lunch cost! But must been expensive though we only drank water and green tea.The toilets are downstairs and the sink is like a Japanese garden with slate steps. See my photo!! There were only two out of I think six toilets working which I think isn't acceptable especially as they didn't put up a notice on the doors. There is a bakery with some gorgeous desserts which I wish I had tried but couldn't walk round london with them as takeaways. There's always next time!!!",

I do love it when restaurants do that without you asking.We ordered a lot of food and when asking the waiter if he thought that would be enough, he kindly and honestly said he thinks we'll be full after the duck but he'll keep everything written down and ask us how we're feeling once we've \u00a0had the duck.We ordered so many different types of dim sum but the real stand outs were the venison puffs, the char sui cheung and the pulled chicken dumplings but they were all amazing!The duck was also fantastic. Beautifully cooked, crispy on the outside and pure meaty bliss once forked. I love the crispy bits! :) By the time we'd finished the duck we were stuffed and I'm so glad we didn't have the rest but I'll definitely be back to try more!They also brought me a birthday macaroon which was a lovely touch!It was a birthday meal I will always remember and I 100% agree with the decision on it receiving a Michelin star.

So far business as usual.We arrived at exactly 8pm, and got our table downstairs as requested.Upon ordering, our waiter seemed quite uninterested, and was almost 'bitchy' when I asked about a dish we had the previous time. Hmmm.The music was extremely loud, even more so than previous times, which made conversation quite strenuous. \u00a0We overheard the table next to us complain about the same problem. (On a separate note, they were annoyed as well about getting their main course before their starters).The food quality was excellent, as always. \u00a0Nothing to say about that.HOWEVER .. when we decided to order desserts at 9pm (one hour after arriving, ordering, and getting our dishes), we were told that \"our table was booked only until 9:15pm, so it would be almost impossible to serve us desserts\". Wait. WHAT?So we called the maitre d' to enquire about this. \u00a0He first started asking us if we were walk-ins. \u00a0Then proceeded to tell us that our reservation was for 7pm and we'd been an hour late. SERIOUSLY? \u00a0How UNPROFESSIONAL can one be?If we'd been an hour late, our table would have been gone for 45 mins, since they have a 15min holding policy, so that excuse didn't fly! And not knowing we booked several weeks in advance, and then making us feel like it was our fault? NO WAY!As said, the quality of the food was excellent, but the service is an absolute disgrace!In the end, the desserts were on the house, but a situation like this should NEVER have occurred in a Michelin-star restaurant!The whole experience left us leaving quite annoyed and bitter, and ruined what should have been a memorable anniversary dinner.We'll give Yauatcha another try next time, but if this is the standard they're holding up now, it's bye-bye, never again.",

We settled on a citrus based cake, which was made with grapefruit and lemon. When the server brought it over it looked almost too beautiful and intricate to eat. We also ordered a pot of jasmine tea which tasted just so perfect. It was light, floral and fragrant. As we weren't eating a main meal they seated us at the bar, which was fine. The place is beyond stylish and feels like when you're at your best friends parents house and they've seated you in the guest living room, and your kind of too frightened to move in fear of breaking some expensive antique. I digress! Visit the toilets, the basin is a piece of art work in its own right.",

Venison puffs: Outrageously amazing. \u00a0The pastry is light and flakey and the filling is sweet, savoury, and just perfect.2. Chili fried squid: Coated in slightly sweet, fried oats... It sounds odd, but it was such a delight.I will certainly be returning for these two dishes!",

We headed in, they took our coats and luggage, and we were sat in the blue lit bar area since we were just having pud. We giggled struggling to read the menu in the low light and candles (who knew blue light made it so difficult?) Picking cocktails and elaborate puds. The seats were tall and oddly comfy, and the atmosphere in both the bar and the restaurant were lovely, and the view into the kitchen gave us a peek at what we were waiting for. (also, people watching through the one way wall kept us entertained too!) Things didn't take long to arrive, and they were presented beautifully, and tasted even better. We plumped for things with ingredients that weren't every day, and there was a nice range to choose from, but ours were just lovely, tart, and well balanced, with a really nice mix of textures too. I'd like to come back and eat more than just puddings, because it all smelt great!",

Make sure to reserve well in advance as it gets very crowded. Choose to sit downstairs to enjoy the blue aquarium and cool lighting.Easy to get overwhelmed by all the choices of dim sum. Best to choose a selection of three/four (3 pieces each) so 9/12 total and you are all set. Around \u00a325/person with tea. Fair price. Have had more expensive meals in Chinatown in a less pleasant atmosphere. It was my birthday and they brought a complimentary plate of macarons and a candle. \u00a0Nice touchOne star off for the service, I had booked at 830pm and we had to wait in the entrance for 30min so our table would be ready. Crowd accumulates in the entrance area so not super cool to wait there. However, you can check out the offer of macarons and pretty cakes overlooking the street... And not too much leg room under the table. In a nutshell: original, tasty dim sum in a chic atmosphere",

    "text": "Is memory playing tricks , or are standards slipping here ? A recent Saturday lunch here was marred by a few things. First, the reduced size of the menu ( relative to days of yore, circa 2009), means that some of the \"wow\" factor dishes have disappeared. I lament, in particular, the passing of the salt-and-pepper quail. The venison puffs , which used to be so ethereal, are now merely nice. Worse still, some dishes I swear could have come from any one of a dozen places in Chinatown - pleasant, but wholly undistinguished. The drinks, as has been noted, are something of a stitch up - no mid-range sake, for example, only the cloudy version ( which comes in an effete pink bottle fit for Barbie and Ken, and can only be drunk cold). Brief discussion of the situation with staff suggested that they were pretty clueless on this score - not actually their fault if the leadership is not educating them. Saving graces ? Well the macaroons are still gorgeous, and the (much reduced) dessert menu does offer delights such as the Coconut Charlotte, so light and otherworldly I'd imagine it's the kind of thing angels eat as a holiday treat. The people inside are much prettier than in your average central London dim sum factory. It's not the place to come, perhaps, for a slap-up feed, but you'll be aware that you could have had something 75 % as good for 50% of the price elsewhere.",

But the service here sucks, big time. Despite the place being half empty they were really cagey about giving us a table in the first place, and when we sat down it took some time for them to take our order. It then took considerably longer for them to serve us our desserts and tea, which is the only thing we ordered. When it came to paying we asked for the bill 3 times and it never came, and it was only when we got up and went to what looked like the manager that we got our bill, obviously with an 'optional' service charge already included.We also wanted to buy some sweets to take away but that took absolutely ages too, despite me going behind the counter and actually jumping up and down to try and attract their attention.The only redemption was that the same person who looked like the manager didn't charge for some of the chocolates, but I think that's actually because he was just trying to be nice to my lady friend (who is of course, a hottie)!Annoyingly though, I will have to return to try the dim sum because of all the other badass reviews saying how great it is!",

To quote my boyfriend: \"the food was blindingly good.\" The food came out in a well paced manner where we were never waiting for food, nor did we feel rushed, even though we had a return time on the table reservation. Our Waiter was pleasant and knowledgeable. The room itself was open and nice enough - not unpleasant, but not somewhere you would want to hang out for an extended amount of time. not to mention the music was a bit thumpy, although the chairs were so low that my ankles hurt from being cramped. It actually was so uncomfortable that i had to half take off my heels under the table. Im rather glad i didnt see the bill. i have a feeling it was not for the light of pocket.",

Example = har gow. Sticky rice was really good. The pork belly with truffle was super super fatty. The crispy aromatic duck was really dry. The macarons are to die for. I tried the toasted rice, pistachio, passion fruit and the caramel. All very good.",

I had Har Gau, Prawn and bean curd Chaung-fen, and Spinach cuttlefish & prawn balls. It added up to 22.58 pounds (including a 13% service charge and a 1 pound donation to a certain foundation that I know nothing about.)The food was over salted in general and the skin of the Har Gau broke as soon as my chopsticks touched it. The Chaung-fen was nothing special.The most ridiculous part? I couldn't finish my Chaung-fen so I asked the waitress if she could box the left-over and she said the restaurant does not allow their diners to box the leftovers. If it's a buffet, fine. But when a client has already paid for the food, you'd rather see it go to waste than have the client take it home? That logic is completely bulls. I asked for my change and put every penny back into my wallet. Definitely won't come back again. In the future, I'd rather spend that amount of money on a decent steak at Jamie's Italian.",

WRONG. \u00a0It wasn't proper dimsum. \u00a0It was stupid. \u00a0I didn't like it. \u00a0And then my boss took me to Yauatcha and I was all . . . what is this? \u00a0Amaze. \u00a0They've got turnip cakes and chicken feet. \u00a0But it's POSH. \u00a0This is culinary mentalness on a whole other level where the level is one of joy in my mouth.I used to think that all they served was cakes cos that's what they have in the windows - you know, those well pricey macaroons and stuff - and the windows are fully glass and blue (like, bright blue) and it looks Expensive and it is. \u00a0But dimsum - well, it ain't cheap, not even in China (where I lived), depending on who's paying, so you can't really go with an empty purse or expect to skimp and still get the good bits. \u00a0It's not peasant food, like beef and tomatoes or special fried rice (which are nice too but not in the same way). \u00a0Still you get used to seeing the same old crap in Chinatown and some of that's here but this is the Good Stuff, like stuff from China, the original stuff.Yeah, the starry-ceilinged downstairs with background reed flute music harks of Chessington World of Adventures and the bathroom is very S&M dungeon (with Aesop hand-soap) and the tables are so low that the waiters can't hear when you order, but blimey is the food tasty.I've always been too full after stuffing my face with dimsum and a main course (it's not how they do it in China, WHERE I LIVED, but when the boss is paying, you do what you're told) so I've never had a pudding, but they look utterly epic. \u00a0One day I will. \u00a0Somebody take me to Yauatcha and buy me a macaroon, won't you? \u00a0And I'll order the dimsum since I know these things (from when I lived in China) so everyone's a winner.The oolong tea costs \u00a38. \u00a0Don't order it.",

I've often wandered past the minimalist windows and admired their intricate and delectable delights, but until this week I had never set food inside this temple of simple but divine Dim Sum. Despite the decor making the place feel slightly like a hotel lobby bar, the food was sublime. We were being treated by a regular who steered us towards some of his Dim Sum favourites and we were rewarded with classics like a moist and savoury Char Sui Bao, the most perfect jasmine smoked ribs and some surprising but delicious 'venison balls'. Less awe-inspiring ,but all the while excellently executed, were the prawn and mango crispy parcels, the singapore and mushroom dumplings, but the pumpkin dumplings and superlative soft shell crab (you simply must order it) made up for it. The proof being in the pudding, the dessert here was always going to be outstanding. I'm glad to say we were not disappointed when we tucked in to our choices. Sometimes pretty asian versions of French pastries can be a delight to behold but a little disappointing on the tongue, not so at Yauatcha - everything we tasted was exquisite, as well as photogenic. So much so that we bought more to take away for 'tomorrow'...or maybe just a midnight snack!Oh you should also seek out the mandarine and spicy chili fruit juice in the drinks menu - lip-smackingly good!",

If you make a reservation and that is quiet necessary, ask for a table downstairs and then preferably for table 21( for 2 persons), table 16 or 20(both for 6 to 8 persons). From these tables you have a lovely view into the kitchen. Start your evening at the bar and try out one of their delicious cocktails. We, as non alcohol drinkers, tried the lime-cucumber-yasmin ice tea. Devine drink.From the dinning menu we tried and shared the following dishes; lobster dumpling with tobiko caviar, spinach ball with prawn and cuttlefish, steamed king crab roll, fried chili squid, crispy duck roll, hot&sour soup with trumpet mushrooms and our absolute favorite of the evening ; spicy aubergine with sato beans, okra and french beans with peanut. What a treat! And last but not least, the deserts are finger licking good. You can also go there for lunch or make a reservation for their outstanding high tea.",

    "text": "Oh Yauatcha, you had me at spicy szechuan wontons....My friend sent me a list of restaurant recommendations for a quick trip to London and this was at the top of the list. I was skeptical that any dim sum restaurant could be michelin-rated. Dim sum is dim sum. Boy was I wrong...We arrived early for our reservation. After standing around for a few minutes, they took us to a table downstairs. The place was packed. I started with a peach tea smoothie. Yummy, but nothing I haven't had before. Then the food started arriving.First up, spicy szechuan wontons. One bite into the thing and I was convinced. Dim sum is not just dim sum. After we ate the wontons, my husband proceeded to lick up the spicy sauce. Next was the pan-fried turnip cake. I didn't even order this - I ordered the pan-fried taro cake but my American accent must have tripped them up. Oh well, I ate it anyway. And boy was I glad I did. This thing was awesome! It was pan-fried with eggs and chives (or scallions?). Mmmm...best mistake ever. While everything was good, those were the two dishes that really stuck out at me. Other things we had - crispy duck roll (kind of disappointing), prawn cheung fun (good but not that different from other dim sum places), sticky rice in lotus leaf (good but, like the cheung fun, it was similar to what you'd get at other dim sum places), poached peking dumpling (spicy but delicious), spring onion puff (good, not great). I can't remember what else. Then came the egg white and salted fish fried rice. This was a bowl of deliciousness. I still crave this. After all of this, we were stuffed. But we ordered some more szechuan wontons anyway. My husband complained about being too full but drank all the sauce again anyway. I'm kind of bummed we didn't try more stuff from the menu. I love dim sum and Yauatcha was a nice surprise.",

I made reservation for 2:30, they made us wait near the entrance where kids and strollers are running around all over the place. Stressed out with low blood sugar level, it was a bad start to begin with.To the menu. I saw guotie (potstickers) on the menu, it was a chinese wait staff so I spoke in Chinese. and she repeated my order saying that it's steamed dumplings. I was like guotie HAS to be fried. that's the meaning of the words. She pointed to the english translation that it's steamed. If that's the case the chinese name should've been jiaozi \u00a0definitely NOT guotie .To the hongyouchaushou \u00a0. It's a shanghainese dish and shanghainese dumpling wrappers are different from the cantonese ones. Ours are made with just white flour. The fact that they used Cantonese dumpling wrapper for my hongyouchaushou \u00a0 is borderline offensive.Overall the quality of the food wasn't that great. I much prefer Shanghai Blues for similar price and much better ambience. The bill took forever to come and the place is just poorly organized. I'm glad that I tried it and checked it off the list but probably won't go back there again.",

I'd compare Yauatcha to Hakkasan; I do prefer Yauatcha a little more. \u00a0Except for the kitchen, I don't think there was a single Asian staff in the restaurant. \u00a0The wait staff is comprised of good looking young men and women that seemed like aspiring actors or models. \u00a0With that said, the service was professional and attentive. While the food (dim sum) is traditional the quality was steps beyond most dim sums I've had, even in L.A. \u00a0The non-Asian part of the restaurant is the large display of European desserts and hand-crafted gourmet chocolate. \u00a0There is also a 25-feet long macaron bar by the front window that makes every passerby stop and admire. \u00a0The sweet and sour pork was delicious beyond my expectation. The batter was crispy, the pork seemed like lean pork tender loin and the sweetness and tartness of the sauce was perfectly balanced. \u00a0The softshell crab was served with garlic chips that looked like almond slices and, along the the Thai basil, added good body to the flavor of the lightly battered crab. \u00a0The various steamed dumplings were all delicately made and tasted great. \u00a0The biggest surprise of the meal was the baby bokchoy. \u00a0It looked quite simple without any garnish yet the flavor was quite complex. \u00a0I never thought that a plain vegetable like this can taste this good. \u00a0It tasted like it had been stir-fried with chicken stock and Shaoxing wine.The desserts were all excellent and the presentation impressive. The tough part was to make the choice from so many options.Expect to pay for the superb dining experience; but it is worth the money.",

They offer so many different lovely exciting things. I had never heard of some of them. My dad got the Kung Pao Chicken dish because he's scared of trying new things, but he really loved it so that's good! My mom and I shared: prawn and bean curd cheung funscallop shui maisteamed vegetable dumplingmushroom spring roll with black truffleking crab dumpingEverything we ate was very delicious. I had never tried cheung fun before but it was really interesting! It was a delicious prawn and bean curd filling in an incredibly crunchy layer with a pasta-like cover. Lots of textures and flavours. The spring roll was also a win because the truffle flavour was amaaaaazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the vegetable dumpling just because it was nothing special, but for the most part everything was very delicious and the service was great. I even got to see the lady at the table next to me dump all of her ribs on her lap, wrap them in her napkins and put them in her purse! I suppose she's got a dog at home? Also, by the way, they don't offer take-away containers, in case you couldn't figure that out.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying how excited I was to try my first Michelin Star restaurant. My overall experience was great but I just couldn't see how this is a Michelin Star Restaurant. I've traveled across the world for food, been to many upscale venues, and have had much better dim sum. I'm mind blown that this place received such a prestigious award over other establishments. The ambiance was elegant and modern. The service was standard for a high-end restaurant but the food was not that impressive. We ordered five a la carte dim sum dishes to share between the two of us for lunch. We got Har Gow, Wagyu Puff, Shrimp Cheung Fan, Crab and Pork Soup Dumplings, and Scallop Shumai. The food was subpar but the dessert was pretty good! We got the Chocolate Pebbles cake. Hmmm... maybe they got their Michelin Star for their desserts?",

    "text": "If their take out desserts are a part of the reason for their Michelin star, I can see why. Yauatcha was the last foodie stop I made during my trip in London as I was craving macarons. Unique Asian inspired macarons, yes please! Tip - this is a restaurant, so if you're just here for the desserts, inform the hostess and then make a sharp right to the display of desserts. You won't regret it!I went with a bag of 6 for 9.80 pounds, which is pretty affordable given Yauatcha's status; they could have easily marked up their prices! The 6 flavors I chose were the coconut, matcha yuzu, apricot pistachio, strawberry, salted caramel, and the sesame. Extra star for the superb service - for my last macaron, I couldn't decide, so I asked for suggestions. The employee recommended the popcorn or the coconut, in which I went with the coconut. To my surprise, she then gave me a popcorn macaron just because! If a popcorn macaron sounds weird to you (it sounded strange to me at first), fear not because it was absolutely delicious! Definitely was one of my favorites! Although they were all really good, the other highlights were the matcha yuzu, the coconut, and the sesame. Basically just get the Asian inspired flavors! Also, these macarons come packaged in a cute little pink bow, making it a great gift :)",

    "text": "Michelin stars aren't just handed out to those who ask for them, and while i only sampled a few dessert offerings at Yauatcha as opposed to their flagship Cantonese dishes, I certainly see why they get the attention that they do. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?From their super high end dessert bar to their very chic and contemporary formal dining area (with light that's oh so conducive to taking photos of your dishes), Yauatcha absolutely oozes class, and you can immediately spot the similarities to their mother ship Hakkasan (neon blue ring a bell?). Service is fast, friendly, and formal. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Macarons are expensive these days, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that my macarons at Yauatcha, where were notably large, only priced out to be $2.10 USD each once I did the conversion from pounds. That's notably cheaper than (smaller) macarons that I've had at Pierre Herme in Paris, which is certainly a win. I also ordered a signature 'Chocolate Pebble' that was a staggering six pounds, but I really can't fault the prices of flagship specialty desserts. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?One thing I'll point out is that the macaron flavors were just a tad bit limited at Yauatcha compared to some other shops that I've been to. Sure they had salted caramel and coconut and orange, but missing were classics like vanilla and rose or fun contemporary options like apple pie or banana. That's not really a fault (Pierre Herme has the same issue), but it was note worthy. The macarons themselves were excellent. Outside of the coconut all six of my macarons had excellent and more importantly consistent contrasting textures with powerful flavors on the back end, and the salted caramel in particular was divine. Arguably most surprising was the Chocolate Pebble, which was a symphony of truffle and liquid chocolate that had me appreciating chocolate like I'm not sure I ever have done. Dual Stars Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?Yauatcha has earned all of the acclaim they've received, but their macarons fall ever so short compared to my all-time global favorites at Miann (Auckland) and Pierre Herme (Paris). I will certainly be back for the food though to give Yauatcha a proper and more thorough look. No Star Granted.",

We also had the beef hor fun noodles, which went nicely with the dim sums. Lastly, they had a rather modern and western desserts menu, which we enjoyed to top off the meal.Having said all that, I wasn't so sure if it lived up to all the fame and hype. Everything was good, but I felt lacked a differentiating personality. Service was overall good, though our waiter was quite curt. He seemed to be in a bad mood, and our interactions were not very pleasant. Ambience was posh -- possibly the most modern and western dim sum place I've been to. A good choice if you're looking to impress whilst also enjoying down to earth dim sums. Overall, would recommend it, but don't keep your expectations up too high.",

However, abysmal service soured my whole experience, and the food wasn't good enough to make up for it. Right from the start, my server gave no greeting, did not ask if I had any questions, did not explain the menu (and it's quite a huge menu to navigate), just said \"You ready?\" and waited with his notepad. He was entirely unhelpful when I asked him to describe certain dishes, giving shrugs or an apathetic \"Yeah, it's good.\" When I asked for recommendations, he asked if I had dietary restrictions. I told him I did not eat cilantro, and the one item he recommended (wild mushroom dumplings) had cilantro. After taking a bite, I left the rest untouched - but I never saw the server again, and even when I mentioned to another server what had happened, there was no attempt to apologize, or ask if I'd like to order something else in its place. \u00a0The other dumplings I got (poached chicken) were excellent. I also tried the crispy duck - and while I wanted to like it because it was a different take on Peking duck (I have no idea how it was prepared as that was - of course - not explained, but the duck was shredded in front of you instead of sliced), it was so dry that it was inedible without the sauce (which my server said would be \"oyster sauce\" - it was not - it was the classic Peking duck sauce). Too bad. Hope you have better luck than I did at this joint.",

Water was not refilled and my utensils were not changed even though we asked for new plates. Our table was left uncleaned until we had to ask the manager to wipe it after 10 minutes or so. It seems they employ young untrained waiting staff. If you are looking for a good Chinese meal with very uncomfortable seating in a hip environment this is the place for you, however if you have visited other Michelin restaurants you will be deeply disappointed.",

They phoned me up 2 days beforehand to check that I was still coming which was good. Arrived at the restaurant and the staff were really friendly. Sat down and was offered water and a Cucumber dish with 3 difference dips. One was really hot (chilli type dip) another more of a sweet and sour type and the last one I think was soy sauce. Ordered our drinks but had to wait 45mins for it to arrive which was the most annoying thing of the evening. First dish arrived which was the Venison puff, tasty bits of meat in a pastry with sesame seeds on top. Had to wait around another 15-20 mins or so for the next 3 dishes to arrive, scallop shui mai which was delicious, lobster dumpling which had a hint of ginger. Last one was Champagne scallops which was also nice. We then had to wait another 20 or so minutes for our beef in black bean sauce and rice and noodles dishes to arrive. When they came, only the rice and noodles arrived and we had to wait about 10 mins for the beef to turn up. By the time it came the noodles were cold. Shame, because the beef was really nice and soft!!! Didn't bother ordering desert because we couldn't be bothered to wait again and we had already been sitting on the table for nearly 2 hours. Asked for the bill (waited another 10 mins for it)The food was top notch, staff really friendly. Only thing that stops it being 5 stars was all the waiting about. Would give the place another go just to see if the waiting about was just a one off!!!",

Must have: Prawn and beancurd cheung fun, seafood dumpling soup, venison puff, spicy pork szechuan wontons, \u00a0and king crab shanghai siew long bao.Service was great, make a reservation if you plan on coming on a weekend.",

The food is high quality, well made, and not greasy. It's definitely far above your typical Chinese fare. I'm in love with the food here! Perhaps the best dim sum I've had yet.I saw every single table order the bbq ribs, but I personally didn't find those worthwhile. While they were very delicious, they're overly salty and not the most amazing I've had. Hey, I am from the south after all. :PThe service was absolutely impeccable.

With this particular dish, the green wrapper was delicate but held its own against the sweetness of the shrimp and distinct flavor of the chives. One bite of this little parcel didn't take me back to a different time or place, instead it created its own unique experience. Yauatcha describes itself as a dim sum teahouse but I have only known it for its beautifully designed desserts (it's hard to miss their display of carefully lined goods that welcome you into the restaurant as you enter). This time around we came for lunch as I was curious to sample Michelin star dim sum.It came at a price. \u00a0For \u00a3125 we also sampled lobster dumplings with tobiko caviar, king crab dumplings, striploin beef with enoki mushroom cherng fun, spicy pork Szechuan wonton, sweet potato mushroom mei-si rolls, two pots of tea and sake. \u00a0I have to say I was impressed, not just by the creativity of the pairing of the food but by how well it worked. It certainly isn't a place where I can frequently dine but I'll be coming back when I want to try a fusion of something old and new done right.",

Given the fact that you are paying significantly more for the food, they shuffle you out the door after your meal as soon as they can (I asked for a round of drinks toward the end of the meal which was immediately followed by a conversation with the manager), I don't think it's worth it at all. Don't order the Halibut - too fishy. Granted, I am in a unique position to eat dim sum at great places which are a small fraction of the price but when in London, I would say find another place to eat.I know London is different from many cities but I was not impressed by the service either. I usually don't ding places for their service because there are a ton of factors involved and many times, there are reasons happening behind the scenes so I only offer that up for information.

All of the food came out in a timely manner and \u00a0 our server thoroughly explained each dish to us.

    "text": "I'm making my way through high-end Chinese restaurants in London. In general, I have a narrative in my mind that while some asian foods, like sushi, enjoy a high markup, Chinese food in the Western world is often seen as cheap takeaway. You expect to have your kung-pao chickens and beef and broccolis served up to you in a takeaway box for about \u00a35 - leading to caricatures like Panda Express in the states and Wok to Walk in the UK. The problem with these too for actual Chinese establishments is that because of this unidimensional view and a universal expectation of cheapness - Chinese restaurants end up battling over operational efficiency - cutting costs, skimping on taxes, paying minimum wage. Re-imagined, upscale Chinese restaurants would bring the benefit of giving Chinese chefs in the western world more freedom to experiment and explore while raising the overall expectation of what a Chinese restaurant could be.Yauatcha, I'm visiting right on the cusp of having Duck and Rice yesterday. But Yauatcha is in style more similar to Hakkasan than it is Duck and Rice. So after I've eaten all of these foods, imagine my surprise when I realized that all three of these restaurants were created by the SAME GUY - Alan Yau; Yautcha of course being his namesake, Hakkasan named after his ethnic minority background of being Hakka and Duck and Rice I can only imagine because the guy probably GORGES himself on that stuff. Good for him.I happened to come with my Asian American roommate from New York that also went to Harvard (many shared identities as you can see) and we both had the Tou Chan. You can find the menu online, but I'll run through some of my favorite of the dishes:Chicken GyozaWild Mushroom Dumpling \u00a0- I generally like anything named \"wild mushroom x\" and this was no exceptionBeef in black-bean sauce - so good, it reminded me of my childhood favorite \"dou chi ling yu\" which is fish with black bean.Ultimately a great meal, for a reasonable \u00a335.I also highly enjoyed the \"nan\" and the \"nu\" on the door and briefly wondered how a non-Chinese reader would be able to distinguish between the men and women's bathroom, until I looked more closely and saw the \"W\" and \"M\" etched into the doors.",

    "text": "High end beautiful dim sum restaurant. Very fancy and pricy for dim sum in London but quite delicious and surprisingly the few dishes I had tasted authentic. I was expecting it to be westernized since it's not like your typical dim sum restaurant. I went solo so couldn't order too many things thus just got a few classics.- steamed pork buns : pork was good mix of sweet and savory and the buns are nicely filled with the pork, they didn't skimp on the filling. It was slightly oversteamed but the taste was still really yummy.- scallop and pork siu Mai : unlike traditional siu Mai, the scallop wasn't dried it was a fresh one! Probably why it was so expensive for just 3 pieces. I prefer the cheaper version with dried scallop but this was also quite tasty. - Xiao long bao(pork soup buns) : the wrapper is thicker than I usually prefer it but the taste of the soup and pork were on point! Overall really good experience, great service and ambiance. Heard their cocktails are worth trying as well. Will have to come back with a bunch of people to try more dishes!",

    "text": "A Michelin Chinese restaurant in Soho London that specializes in Dim Sum. It opened in 2004 by Alan Yau who also created Wagamama and Hakkasan. Rated as one of the top restaurants in London plus multiple locations worldwide.....I was excited to try this place. But what a shocking disappointment in regards to the food. This place was highly recommended by some friends. They said this place offers some of the best Chinese food in London......I would 100% disagree. Maybe for non-Chinese people (which is all I saw in the restaurant).The inside is a cool and sexy contemporary vibe. The ambiance with the bright floor, star-lit ceiling, neon lighting, and aquarium bar in the basement is a clever refreshing way to bring light to this otherwise dark and cave like space. When we arrived the hostess took our coats and bags and seated us at the bar downstairs for a few drink while our table was bring prepped. It was at that minute I noticed not one other Asians were eating here.....At the bar downstairs the drinks were divine. My husband got cognac and me some tropical lychee non alcoholic drink. The bartender was excellent. Drinks were delicious. Dishes are colourful with strong flavours and texture contrasts according to the website with dim sum as the highlight. Once are table was ready they brought us to our table to start ordering. Here is what we ordered:Scallop shui maiChar siu bunCrispy duck rollPrawn cheung funWagyu beef puffStir-fry rib eye beef in black bean sauceEvery tasted off. The stir fry rib eye and crispy duck roll was the closest to authentic...even that was a far stretch. I looked straight into the kitchen and saw only Chinese chefs......I should have asked to speak to a chef and asked him to cook me something off the menu. My husband ordered so much because he was simply hungry. But I asked him to stop ordering, grab the check, and let's head to Chinatown to eat after here. I was not about to waste precious macros on bad food. Service was pretty standard and could only get so good as it was super busy. The bartenders offered great service though. Definitely deserve a mention. I can see how this would get a Michelin Star for interior design, service, and playing/presentation. Food though no offense reminded me of PF Chang's in the states. I don't see how it get a Michelin Star. But that must be why not one Chinese person was seen here eating when I visited. Go if you want a sexy and fun dinner. But not if you want authentic dim sum.",

FOOD:Glancing at the case of cakes, I literally wanted to try everything! They all looked so beautiful. After much deliberation, I decided on the Honey Jasmine Milk Chocolate cake. I didn't try it that night, but the next day and it was soooo delicious! The decor is designed to perfect. There were 3 layer compacted into the tiny cake: milk chocolate ganche, jasmine buttercream and honey buttercream and chocolate pop rocks! SERVICE: If you want to come here just for the cakes, let the hostess know and they will call someone over to help you out at the cake station. The lady that helped us was really friendly! I asked if I could take a picture of the cake before she boxed it and she actually gave me the best looking one and asked if I wanted to take picture of any other cake. They box your cake in one of those boxes that you don't want to throw out.If I'm ever back in London, I would come back just for the cakes!",

Atmosphere - The restaurant is very modern looking and tastefully decorated. \u00a0We ended up sitting in the bar for dinner, but it didn't matter. \u00a0Many times I didnt feel that I was in a restaurant. \u00a0It felt like a cool place to hang out. \u00a0Service - The service was top notch. \u00a0The servers were attentive, but not overbearing. \u00a0I never had to ask for a refill as they approached us at the right time. \u00a0The dishes (yes there were a lot) were brought out in stages as it didn't feel that we had things piling up. \u00a0We took our time and really enjoyed the experience. \u00a0Great Job. \u00a0We really enjoyed our experience and told many of our friends.",

The sweet and sour soup with mushroom was very flavorful and thick....and served piping hot in a bowl with a lid. The Thai chicken was crispy yet moist and tasty, not spicy.The Kung pao chicken was quite good but had way too many peppers in it--they were a quarter of the dish! The vegetable fried rice was so good-- lots of flavor.And we had one of their slices of mocha cake for dessert; so much flavor packed into a few delicious bites!Pricey but worth it!",

Even though the dim sum is pricey compared to other Chinese restaurants, I think it's still worth the price since they use more expensive ingredients. My favorite was the scallop xiu mai. After eating here, I'd have to say this was the best dim sum restaurant I've ever had (and I've had a lot) but it's also by far the most expensive.

You'll need a reservation, so be sure to make one online or by phone. Things worth ordering:- Large Soup dumpling. \u00a0This is NOT the xiao long bao. \u00a0This is a small little pot lined with a dumpling wrap and stuffed with shrimp, scallop, and other delicious seafood bits. \u00a0The best part of this dish is the flavor of the soup that the dumpling is steamed in. - Shrimp cherng fun - The noodle wrap is very soft, yet not soggy. \u00a0The shrimp is also very fresh and crisp. - Turnip cake. \u00a0They prepare the dish a bit differently than the traditional style, pan frying the turnip cake with an egg. \u00a0Things you can skip: - Shumai. \u00a0These are tiny and not very good. - Small Soup dumpling. \u00a0Xiao long bao. \u00a0The dumplings have a lot of soup. \u00a0One thing to note is that they stuff their dumplings with fish and pork, which is not common.",

The Char Siu Buns (\u00a34.20) were a bit low on filling but the small amount there was tasted delicious. The Chinese Chive and Prawn Dumplings (\u00a35.60) were impressive as was the Pan-fried Turnip Cake with dried shrimp (\u00a35.50) - an often overlooked classic. To round off the dim sum we had a portion of Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf with chicken and dried shrimp (\u00a35), which was pretty authentic.On to the main courses we ordered Stir-fry Double Cooked Pork Belly in chilli sauce (\u00a311.30), Thai Style Chicken with mango, papaya and chilli, coriander (\u00a313.80) and a side of Spicy Aubergine, Sato Bean, Okra and French Beans with peanut (\u00a312.90), a portion of Beef Ho Fun (\u00a311) and a pot of Jasmine Rice (\u00a32.20). The pork was decent, but nothing special. The ho fun at Yauatcha wasn't as good as places like Phoenix Palace or Gerrard's Corner. The chicken however was a revelation! Crispy, zingy, fresh, stunning - it was a shame we had to share it!Being a birthday meal, there was an inevitable dessert with a candle and a bunch of staff singing \"Happy birthday dear ______... Happy birthday to yooooou!\". My brother had gone over to the dessert counter on his way to the bathroom and picked out the Apple Pie (\u00a38.50). Pretty cool dessert with a mousse on top shaped to look like an apple.",

I'd been told it was more focused on dim sum and was \"cheaper.\" Well, you can say that again. Pretty much anything's cheaper than Hakkasan. ;)I enjoyed catching up with an old roommate on a recent trip here, and unlike Hakkasan, I truly felt that the high quality and exquisite presentation did warrant the price premium and Michelin star. Yauatcha brings Western flair to traditional Chinese dim sum with gorgeous results. I mean that too, as I'm of Cantonese descent and I've had plenty of good dim sum in Hong Kong, mainland China, Canada, and the U.S. The one dish that still sticks in my mind was the roasted duck pumpkin puff, which was almost too pretty to eat. It's a deep fried shell made to look exactly like a miniature pumpkin - complete with a tiny leaf - and it's packed full of flavorful roasted duck. Yauatcha is also known for its macarons, and my friend got a takeaway box for his girlfriend. We didn't have any problems with service whatsoever, and all in all we had a pleasant time catching up. Definitely a place to try at least once if you're a dim sum connoisseur and your budget allows.",

    "text": "For Chinese people, the concept of expensive fusion dim sum is a bit strange. Not to mention in general \u00a35 for an order of crab siu mai is a bit ridiculous.The idea of venison puff pastry/pie at a Chinese restaurant is a bit strange, but we went for it. We also ordered the standard dishes - cheung fun (rice rolls), fried rice, siu mai, har gao etc. Some of the dishes were standouts such as the har gao/siu mai/turnip cake, but we were definitely let down by others. The noodles were greasy and bland, and the fried rice was burnt. Service here is...unique. Transport Chinatown service to Soho and that's what you get. Not a single smile, exasperated looks thrown at me...not really sure what our table did to warrant it! We ended up having to send back the fried rice because parts of it were actually black at the bottom. We also had to wait over 20 minutes to get our dessert of glutinous rice balls covered with peanuts. When I asked one of the servers how long it would take, he told me it takes time. No kidding, I realised it takes time. Then I told him that we waited over 20 minutes for the dessert. He then gives me a quizzical look and questions me, unconvinced that I was telling the truth.By this point, I was a bit fed up, so I just told him to cancel the order. I guess we attracted enough attention because five minutes later the manager comes up with a plate of macarons for us, \"on the house\". With the exception of the chocolate macaron, the four of us all agreed that they were too sweet, stuck to our teeth, and we couldn't even discern what the flavours were supposed to be. I've been to Yauatcha on previous occasions, and there was not a single occasion where the service was acceptable. Really good quality dim sum but I have no choice but to take points off for burnt rice, and the repeatedly rude servers.",

    "text": "Posh Dim Sum. It's a bit of a weird concept to get your mind around, like Richie Rich having a McD's in his mansion. Dim sum for me as always been that lazy, slightly hungover, still in pajamas, meal that I'd dragged myself out of bed for on a way to sunny Sunday. Although, now that I've grown up and somewhat matured in the last 5 years from college, I suppose posh dim sum shouldn't be that surprising.Anyways, on to the place itself. Two floors, both classy, the top being probably better for brunches due to the natural light whereas the lower ground has a starry sky effect ceiling which I could see be perfect for late night drinks or a date. The top floor does have the benefit of the dessert and pastry bar which has some truly mouth watering options on display (which unfortunately I couldn't have as I gave up desserts for Lent). We were downstairs this time, and quickly seated by an attractive hostess in a very comfortable booth. Given that I had cycled 40 miles before noon, the soft cushioning was a very welcome feeling to my sore buttocks. Tap water was requested and quickly received. I think it says something about the high standard to which a place holds itself when even the tap water is served in an elegant stemless flute, perfectly chilled but not cold, with a lemon garnish. They have a selection of teas and smoothies along with an interesting cocktail list. I opted for a lime and passionfruit jasmine iced tea which I could have happily sipped all day except for the fact my glass ran out and I was too busy fighting for food (it's still dim sum no matter how posh) to order another one.Foodwise, everything was tasty but a few things stood out. The char siu bun (roast bbq pork in a slightly sweet steamed bun) was delightful with rich tender pork in a sticky bbq sauce stuffed inside a bun so light it was like eating a cloud...filled with meat. The pork and preserved egg congee was a great comfort food and made me want to make a massive batch for myself (must add it to the weekend plans) although it was just a tad too bland (even for congee). We had the usual array of prawn and pork dumplings. They were good, but nothing to brag about. The scallop dumplings were terrible as the scallops were far too overcooked so I wouldn't recommend that.As most reviews indicate, the venison puffs are another quality dish. The meat filling is good, but the value is in the sweet puff pastry that surrounds it. It seems a bit odd, but the combination of the gamey venison and the sweet flaky pastry is brilliant. I wonder if I could make it by adding honey to regular puff pastry?The final winner was the jasmine tea smoked spare ribs. The ribs were cooked to perfection and the meat literally fell off the bones. The sticky hoisin and bbq sauce was literally fingerlickin' good and the tea added a mild smokiness to the dish that demands to be added to anyone's bbq repertoire.Other thoughts...hmmm let's see. The waitstaff are interesting and it's a bit hit or miss if you get a good one or one you can barely communicate with. The majority speak fluent Chinese (which is helpful when you have a Chinese speaker who can order) and that's always a good thing in a dim sum joint. They have a weird policy where only your waiter/waitress can serve the food from the tray to table so you may have a few minutes where you can see your food next to the table but they won't give it to you. Pricewise, it's expensive (I paid \u00a338 and wasn't left hungry but not stuffed as usual either) and only about half the dishes seemed worth the price. I'm hard pressed to say this would be a better dim sum spot than Ping Pong's \u00a320 all you can eat deal on Sundays, but it's a place to treat yourself to some unusual items.",

Very impressive. Orchids are displayed through out, \u00a0Yauatcha has many interesting features and the beautiful fish tanks are used in away that compliments the decor. Sadly... The glory of Yauatcha stops there. The pricing of the food is fair but portion sizes are quite random. The service.... On this occasion.... Terrible... We waited 25 minutes before asking the manager (who caught the bewildered expression we had on our faces) for a drink as we hadn't seen our waiter since being seated. The manager was very attentive and made a true effort to correct our waiter who clearly was failing to service his section. We noticed tables around us were also waiting, \u00a0and recieving their meals in random orders and feeling.... Like us.... Abandoned.... Definitely unacceptable for a Michelin Star Restaurant. The food.... The food was good but not great, but I think the service had affected this side being appreciated like it should have been. As I said the food is fairly priced although some food items are heavily hiked for what you get. All in all I'm not sure if I should be so hard as to say we didn't enjoy ourselves. We appreciated the friendly attentive staff who ushered us to our table, \u00a0the trendy decor, the innovative ice teas on offer and the food was acceptable but it wasn't mind blowing. The table \u00a0service where we were seated needs work. If I go back I will adjust this review as the restaurant had a feel of being able to redeem itself.",

There was already a queue--of people who had reservations. We waited 40min to be seated, and meanwhile there was no place to sit, no bar, no apology, just a harried-looking man at the front desk looking panicked.The waitress who took us down plowed ahead at speed, clearly feeling rushed; forget the fact that heels + slippery stone stairs down into the basement =/= me sprinting after you, lady. She essentially abandoned us at our table, leaving us to find the coat check ourselves.While the upstairs is fairly quiet and chill, the basement is like a bad nightclub. The music was so loud and so repetitive in its beat (imagine the stereotypical nightclub scene from the last show you watched: it was like that) that we couldn't hear our waiter. The seats are super low; neither of us is particularly tall, but we felt like we had our knees up to our chests and were sitting in kiddy seats.When our waiter finally found us, it was to plunk down the chintzy-looking vinyl-bound menus and run off to see to another table. The menu had plenty of overlap with Hakkasan, so we were fairly hopeful that the quality would be similar, especially since (if I'm not mistaken) it's Yauatcha which has the Michelin star. The waiter kept cutting me off, and so my partner ended up ordering everything. Forget asking questions; he either didn't know the answer or couldn't be bothered to find out.The first cocktail tasted like turpentine, and the waiter apparently had a hard time understanding why it was a problem. It wasn't a matter of a cocktail that wasn't to someone's taste; it tasted like pure (and cheap) vodka rather than something that cost as much as a main.Once that was (begrudgingly) replaced, the appetisers started to show up. Everything was decidedly lacklustre, and we kept comparing the dishes to their parallels at Hakkasan--an easy thing to do considering that many of the dishes literally just had ingredients swapped out (ie, duck 'pumpkins' vs lamb 'pears'). Our food arrived fairly fast, but was shoved onto the tiny table in a haphazard fashion, and someone placed the hot teapot right within easy burning distance (and knocking-over distance) of my elbow, meaning I had to kept avoiding it.Forget getting our waiter's attention for anything: he was too busy juggling six other tables, carving duck tableside, etc. By the time we managed to catch his eye, we were informed that half of the desserts were gone as options and we were pretty much over the ridiculous noise of the place: screaming at each other to be heard is really not how I anticipated spending my birthday evening.I really, really wish that the Michelin rating of this place was revisited, because not a single part of our experience warranted a two-star rating on Yelp, much less a Michelin star. And the price they charge for this sub-par /everything/ is down-right embarrassing.If you want faux Chinese food, noise, and dismissive service, go to Wagamama and save yourself a hundred quid.Oh, and as a bonus, we got to watch a fish dying slowly on its side at the top of the bar-side tank. PETA would have had a ball.",

We ordered five dishes: the char siu bao, lo bak go (or turnip cake), duck/pumpkin puff, crab salad, and prawn and beancurd cheung fun. The char siu bao were amazing, best I've ever had. The duck/pumpkin puff may have been the standout of the night, and those two along with the cheung fun rounded out the top three. The lo bak go was made a bit differently than I'm accustomed to - it had a layer of spring onion and I guess egg over the part you expect. Not bad, but I'll stick with what I'm used to on that one. The swimmer crab salad was nice with mushrooms but probably not worth \u00a311. Desserts all looked great, my friend picked the chocolate pebble and I confess I was slightly underwhelmed. I chose a couple of macarons that were outstanding - esp the mango/passionfruit. Service was great, price was bearable but certainly a rare treat.",

It took about 10 minutes to get the attention of a bar man to get a drink which was a bit disappointing. The food was delicious but the menu quite overwhelming. It would have been nice to get a bit of help/suggestions with it. The staff made a mistake with my friend's drink giving her a gin and tonic when she had asked for a gin and soda. They then insisted it was a gin and soda, however it unfortunately clearly wasn't and took quite a bit of insisting back that the drink was incorrect. The staff also take away plates before you've finished. Be prepared to grab them quick or unfinished plates will be swept away! Overall nice ambience and decor. Lots of choice of food.

    "text": "For more pics: roastedmontreal.blogspot\u2026  Yauatcha was stunning. I was fortunate enough to be part of a corporate night out which included dinner at this restaurant. We entered the restaurant for our 7:00 reservation and had a short wait in the front shop area which is exquisitely designed and sells a selection of macaroons and chocolates in house. They are extremely tempting and a few in our party bought a selection to take home. We were lead downstairs to the restaurant which is a square brick room with a partially hidden kitchen, sparkly lights on the ceiling (sounds tacky \u00a0it isn't) and cut outs in the brick with faux candles. I can imagine what the room must have looked like at one time, and am very impressed with what they've done. The service was absolutely stunning, and I can hand on heart say it was probably the best service I have ever had especially considering we were a group. At one point the manager came to me (I was the organizer) and asked me how my food was. He then very specifically asked how the service was and to please tell him if there was anything. It was extremely sincere and very surprising. A colleague later told me that the reviews about their service on the website were very poor so this appears to be something they are working hard on and have completely turned around. This is impressive, and if you were ever put off from a visit because of this I recommend you visit. For the food I just asked them to bring us a selection to the table. It was brought in even intervals without any long waits, and the empty dishes were quickly whisked away. If we needed another glass or bottle of wine it was almost immediate. I couldn't believe it. We were all very impressed. The food was also very good. Highlights for me were the Beancurd Cheung Fun which I believe was beancurd and pork in a long roll, the scallop shumai with the most exquisitely cooked scallops, and the Ribeye Beef in Black Bean sauce. I didn't try it but was told that the Orchid Pao Chung (Orchid Tea) was amazing. They chose a wide range of dishes for us, and served a perfect amount of food. We didn't drink a lot (3 bottles of wine for 9 people) but it turned out to around \u00a346 per person including tip which is fabulous. I can't wait to go back, and hope it can live up to my previous experience! roastedmontreal.blogspot\u2026",

Quality of food was very good though but the experience was totally ruined by an obnoxious and sarcastic waiter. Service was downright unacceptable as he keeps forgetting our order of extra drinks / coffee and we even have to ask the dessert menu twice. Said waiter always avoided eye-contact and finally we decided to complaint to the manager. We told her to take the discretionary service charge off the bill and she kindly obliged. She apologised for the unpleasant service experienced by us and even took off 2 of our desserts order from the final bill.We appreciated her help / offer but sadly, I don't think I will be back in a hurry. Don't mind splashing out for good quality food on special occasions but service level was just atrocious! We overheard the same service problem on an adjacent table before we left. I would have thought for the price they are charging, the least they could do is provide decent service. As I mentioned, food is great but let down terribly by their unprofessional service!!!",

A sophisticated fusion of tastes and textures. Very good indeed, but still not the best in the kingdom. The shop itself is a delight. A huge array of incredibly good looking cakes.

What the premium pricing does get you, however, is some of the freshest dumplings you will ever have tasted. The dimsum tastes like it is made to order, unlike the mass produced stuff that has been sitting in bamboo steamers all morning. There are also many items on the menu that are certainly not-dimsum or Asian at all: honey glazed lamb ribs, venison puff pastry, etc., that are an interesting take on fusion cuisine. People often talk about the decor here: it is an interesting modern and trendy looking space but very un-Chinese. In fact, other than the kitchen staff, almost everyone else you will encounter (at the door or serving your food) will be Caucasian PYTs of both genders. The experience felt more LA than London. So save up some money and give the place a try, and you'll walk away with a dimsum experience you will still be talking about a year later.",

    "text": "I have eaten at better restaurants, I have eaten better dim sum, I have had better service. But somehow this restaurant still gets 5 stars because I always come out feeling like I've had the loveliest treat ever. The quality of the teas (and tea cocktails), the beauty of the dim sum, the ritual of it all, and the fish and flowers. Yauatcha is a hybrid of a swanky dim sum restaurant and a very posh tea house. Although it's possible to eat dim sum upstairs, the restaurant is technically downstairs, and tea and cake upstairs. The two are very different in character; upstairs is light and airy and downstairs is dark and sexy. When you book to eat, you can choose upstairs or downstairs. Evening meals go downstairs, light snacks, afternoon tea, upstairs. You cannot choose the exact spot when you book, however I recommend once you get there that you specify you would like to sit in the main section downstairs, not around the side. In fact you should insist upon this, and prepare to wait a bit longer. Although this may be a hassle, you will enjoy it far more, I promise. As a reasonably critical person who has visited Yauatcha countless times over the last six years, which is akin to giving the place spot checks throughout its history, I can say one thing: Yauatcha is consistent. As such it's a great place to entertain friends, treat clients, or take one's partner. The style of decor, food, and service treads that fine line between being suitable for business and for romance. One can equally bring one's glamorous Persian girlfriend here late on a Friday night, and one's aging mother for a Sunday afternoon tea. (Currently one has the latter, not the former...) You may find the front of house snooty. Personally I love it. I don't want to be greeted and subsequently ignored by anyone other than the impossibly (I'm not allowed to say \"pathologically\" am I? No) slim, beautiful girls who do it so brilliantly. I like my FOH efficient, with that edge of slight disdain that says \"you do realise where you are, don't you?\" The dim sum is inventive and seasonal, the ingredients are fresh. The menu has naturally changed over the last few years but the favourites still exist to this day; the Baked Venison Puff is a must, although the venison is a little more stodgy than it used to be but the pastry has got even better. Sadly the shark fin soup appears to be off the menu - it's probably best though, isn't it? Oh and I love the latest (Autumn 2010?) addition of the Crystal Dumplings - lovely little translucent steamed things stuffed with pumpkin and pine nut. The Lotus Leaf Rice is another simple, well-executed crowd-pleaser. Mooli puffs are fun little creatures to behold, they are vegetable dumplings with a pastry exterior rolled into the exact shape (and presumably dyed to the same colour) as a little carrot, with some spinach coming out the top. This is high-end-pastry-chef-meets-Roger-Rabbit and I heartily approve. It's a terrible shame their cake counter has been replaced. Yauatcha staff say this is because the cake chef left in Autumn 2009. Oh, the gold-flecked chocolate ganaches - I mourn their passing. (I'm not serious. Actually no yes I am.) Nevertheless the macaroons are still great. The downstairs decor is stunning. You know how some people, when they walk out of the house, they put on a suit and look smart, at all times? Even if they put on a bit of a shabby jacket, they still look ridiculously hot? The interior decor of Yauatcha is that person. It could never become a bit tatty, because it's so hot in the first place. The tropical fish and the flower displays are very special indeed. Music is ambient and always at the perfect level for conversation, and the restaurant's acoustic allows it to become quite lively when busy, but never too loud. It has a lovely bustly feel, but I never get offended by loud groups here. (I usually hate loud groups.) I personally love to enjoy food at Yauatcha on a Sunday afternoon, post-lunch, when the service is relaxed and the downstairs restaurant is quiet. I'm sure it's possible to bring children, but really it's not that kind of place - in case you hadn't guessed. Personally I find it nice to get away from restaurants (especially Sunday afternoons!) that are brimming with prams and cots and toys and screams. Oh, and the bill? It's not pricey especially compared to a number of notably inferior chain dim sum restaurants I could name (some are very nearby...) It caters for all appetites and tastes in food. You simply can't go wrong. Go!",

The most obvious one is a sophisticated tea house, serving the most elegant and amazing cakes and macaroons, which you can see from the big windows opening onto the street. They just look so perfect and colourful and full of flavour. These are served on the ground floor and many people come for takeaway.The other part to Yauatcha is a high-class (and expensive!) dim sum restaurant on the ground floor. Routine dishes are given a lift with exotic ingredients like venison and even gold leaf. Lovely to eat. Expensive ingredients make it better? Debatable I think.So a solid 4 stars - lovely experience but heavy on the wallet.",

Now the exchange rate is much better at least.Apart for the UK pricing, this was a really good restaurant. All the food we had was excellent, and they made some interesting cocktails as well. I definitely liked all the fish tanks. All the decor was well done. We had made reservations so there was no wait. There were some people waiting though who had not.After all was said and done it came out to be about $80 a person. Of course my friend I was traveling with and I paid for the two friends who we were staying with so it became a cinder block to the groin night, and not in a good way.",

    "text": "For pics see Greedy Diva @ greedydiva.blogspot.com/\u2026  Sometimes, when one needs comfort food on a lazy Sunday afternoon, only dim sum will do. And as if to prove that comfort and style need not be mutually exclusive, there's Yauatcha. (There's also my new Massimo Dutti heels, the mildly glam-in-an-officey-way exterior of which belies a sensible, I'm-on-the-wrong-side-of-30, cushioned inner sole. But I digress.) Yauatcha is a modern dim sum tea house with a refined air and a Michelin Star held firmly between its chopsticks. Formerly owned by Alan Yau, it proves to be surprisingly good value (say, around \u00a325 per head) - particularly if you stick to dim sum and tea. Although I caution that the bill does start to stack up if you opt for larger dishes and wine. The ground level, where we enjoy our lunch time dim sum, feels bright and fresh, with shades of blue and a large fish tank lining the entrance. Downstairs, is more dimly lit and clandestine - a popular option for the evening crowd. We start with some roasted blue tea, the Fuijan Wuyi Yan, Shui Xian (\u00a34 per pot), which we chose on the basis that other options are more expensive and our waiter tells us they all taste fairly similar. It's rather bland, and doesn't really improve with the food. Choose another one. Dim sum comes in sets of 3 (reflecting the number's association with good luck and the word \"alive\" in Chinese superstition, but often resulting in heavy negotations for me and the TPG.) The beautifully presented scallop shui mai (\u00a37.50) is a treasure-like bundle of juicy scallops and prawns topped with gleaming jewels of roe. The winter melon dumplings look like pudgy carrots, but are an enjoyable taste of Thai winter melon, black fungus, straw mushroom and gong choi (\u00a33.80). The sticky rice in lotus leaf with chicken and shrimp (\u00a34.80) is good (but not the greatest) but then the char sui bun (3 for \u00a33.50) is fantastic (a must) - and also great value compared to the lesser morsels you might get for around the same price in Chinatown. We steer off the dim sum menu to try the Szechuan seafood claypot (\u00a317.00) - a fresh and colourful mix of prawns, (slightly too chewy) squid, peanuts, mushrooms, snowpeas, baby corn and chilli. TPG was more of a fan than I, but possibly because I think this a dim sum haven for me and I'm reluctant to diverge to the larger dishes unless it's for something extraordinary. Our warm vanilla rice pudding with banana sorbet and caramelised pineapple (\u00a37.50) is absolutely gorgeous, even if the pineapple was a little hard to negotiate. Handmade chocolates and macaroons are also on display - I tried a selection of 4 chocolates for \u00a33 which were reasonably nice but no match for the pudding. One possible hitch to any long, lazy, Sunday afternoon plans you might be hatching is that we were warned our table had to be returned after 2 hours - although no-one policed that once we sat down. We paid around \u00a330 per head for our meal. Yauatcha comes with my seal of approval for dim sum with a touch of glamour on the side. I was so impressed, that I've already booked us into Yauatcha's big brother, Hakkasan, next month. My only regrets are that we missed the bulging, glistening har gua dumplings and the blue swimmer crab salad with sesame dressing, both of which we had to suffer through others enjoying on the next table. As if we need another excuse to go back.",

    "text": "For a world class city, London has some pretty dreadful dim sum venues. Fortunately Yauatcha is one of the good ones. Yes, you end up paying a lot more for the food than you would at some of the other places in London (and certainly more than you would at most places in Hong Kong, San Francisco, Vancouver). Yes, you pay for some of the attitude and decor. Yes, the chairs are pretty uncomfortable.In the end, it's all about the food and you have to admit that some of the dishes are pretty darn good. The har gau are excellent with clear skins and the right amount of bite. The venison puff (cha siu so) are excellent versions with a nice hint of black pepper and a fantastic flaky crust. I especially like the shrimp and beancurd cheung fun; it's their version of \u00a0zha leung but instead of a chinese donut inside, they use a shrimp and beancurd skin roll. Fantastic. Save room for the black sesame dumplings. Some of the best I've ever had anywhere with a truly handmade taste and texture.I agree that some of their dishes (especially the non-dim sum mains) are overpriced. If you can avoid those, you can have an excellent dim sum deal for not much more than you would spend in London Chinatown.My biggest pet peeve is that they only make one pot with each order of tea leaves. Some of the teas, especially the oolongs, actually taste better with the second brewing!",

The food is pretty good but is pricey for what you get. \u00a0I ordered about 8 dishes total for 4 people and we were good in terms of quantity. \u00a0The meats we ordered were on the sweeter side. Shu mai comes in 3s which is a problem for groups not in multiples of 3s. \u00a0Yummy to my tummy:Prawn & Bean Curd Cheung Fun (Excellent contrast of soft and crunchy)Spicy Softshell Crab with Almond (I could eat the entire bed of spicy almond)Jasmine Tea Smoked Ribs (Meat falls off the bone! Sweet ribs but not so messy)venison puff (good pastry but sweet meat)King Crab Siew Long Bao (one of my favorites - soup dumpling! The brothi inside is tasty)Meh - wouldn't get these again:Pork and Prawn Shu mai (meat could've been anything - this came with 4 pieces)Chive and prawns (bitter, wasn't a hit with my group)Crystal Dumpling Wrap with Pumpkin (fried spring roll)Desserts were aiiiite. Raspberry Delice - chocolate raspberry cake. Prettier than it tastesLychee rose - a lot of things going on, Coffee Mascarpone - my favorite of a creamy dessert with hint of coffeeGianduja Lemon - not a fan of chocolate and lemon",

I have tried so many dim sum restaurants in London - most of them in Chinatown or Soho and for me, this is the only one that really met the mark.Came here with my husband and in-laws for Friday night dinner and we were all very happy with the experience. Highlights of our meal were the shrimp dumplings - amazing - I could have had an entire meal of them, the crispy duck pancakes (the duck was so perfectly crisp and tender) and the stir fried rib eye, which had the most beautiful flavours. We also had delicious Singapore noodles and a fantastic shrimp dish that I can't recall the name of. The calamari and prawn toast were tasty, but not a must-have and I wouldn't order them again.Good wine and cocktail list and a great selection of virgin cocktails (bonus for me as I am pregnant!).Fabulous meal, great service and lovely surroundings (I love the starry sky ceiling). We will definitely return again soon.",

I am not going to say it's spectacular because many restaurants in Hong Kong can match up with this level. This is average when comparing to a Hong Kong restaurant but with better ambience.I consider everything else fast food (ping pong or whatever else in china town)..... but this one is the only good quality dim sum place in London.",

    "text": "Hands down the best dim sum in London. You pay for the food for sure, but it is totally worth it. The ingredients are super fresh, the flavor is authentic and the presentation is elegant. This is not your stereotypical dim sum place where people hustle for food. Don't get me wrong, I love that atmosphere. Yauatcha is more posh and proper, you get tiny baskets of food brought your table with a smile. Shrimp dumpling is served at every dim sum restaurant and it is my litmus test for authenticity of a dim sum place. The Shrimp dumpling here among the best I have tasted. They are juice and fresh and you can taste the subtle flavor of the bamboo shoots inside. Everything is really good here, but I particularly like the Xiao Long Bao, turnip cake, shrimp cheung fun, fried chicken chive dumpling, and we can't forget the congee! The pork and preserved egg congee is out of control tasty and perfect for a cold and rainy day in London! No meal is completed without good desserts, and apparently this rule applies to dim sum as well. The desserts here are beautiful, delicate and mouth watering. If you are too full you can bring these lovely babies home to enjoy and prolong the whole experience. You already figured this is not your typical dim sum place, so don't expect they to top up water for your teapot! They charge you for each pot of tea, which I think is not cool. Oh well, nowhere is perfect!",

    "text": "5 stars for the food, -3 for the poor service. I had extremely high hopes for BOTH the food and service, but I was sadly very disappointed. My friend and I had a reservation for 5 pm and were immediately seated upon arriving. Good. Then, we sat there for a good 5 minutes without a menu - heck, we weren't even acknowledged. We had to ASK for the menu. I mean, really? Is it not logical to bring the menu when you seat someone? Anyway, we went for the \"Taste of Yauatcha\" since it included a nice selection of the dim sum options for a great price (28.88 for 2 people). For drinks we just asked for tap water...which arrived 10 minutes later, after having to ask twice. The first six dishes arrived fairly quickly, which was nice. The spring roll, baked venison puff, har gau, prawn shui mai, and siew long bao were all incredibly tasty - definitely the best dim sum I've ever had. After that though, our experience went very downhill.We waited 20 minutes before our next dish arrived, which might have been understandable except for the fact that the table next to us - who ordered around 10 minutes after we did - got their next dishes (they ordered the tasting menu too) before us. They weren't even done with the first six, which we had finished long before their first six even arrived. What made me even more upset was that I could literally SEE the dishes sitting on a nearby cart as the waiters stood by nonchalantly minding their own business, chatting amongst themselves. After a while we also decided to ask for a tea refill, but were told that a refill would incur an extra charge because they don't reuse the leaves. Ummmm ok, whatever.Our last 2 dishes came about 1.5 hours after we first ordered. The cheung fun and stick rice in lotus leaf were both absolutely amazing. Again, they were the best I've ever tried. After finishing, we considered getting dessert but the service was so annoyingly inattentive we figured it would be more efficient to go to order directly from the patisserie bar. So we paid and did just that. Overall, all I can think about is how utterly appalling and slow/inconsistent the service was. The waiters were not at all attentive - not once did they check in on us - and they also treated us very coolly. Whenever we asked for something, they would just briskly set the thing on the table and leave without glancing once at us. Same thing when we asked for the check - they literally dropped the bill onto the table and left. No \"thank you\" or \"hope you enjoyed your dinner.\" Just \"here's the bill ok bye.\" Even when we were paying, the waiter didn't even have the courtesy to ask us the amount we wanted to pay - she just punched her own number in and stuck her hand out for our credit cards. Sorry lady, not that easy. It actually mattered this time because the amount we wanted to pay was different from the receipt because the service was SO bad we didn't want to pay the service charge - which we've NEVER done before. Honestly though, they didn't deserve it AT ALL.Yauatcha - sure, your food is good. But your service is also terrible. So no, I will not be back, and I would not recommend anyone to visit either unless they're ok with sloppy, disrespectful, and terribly disappointing service.",

After ordering some amazing appetizers, we had a lovely dinner... much of it was small plates, the normal dim sum, just higher quality... One thing stuck out, it was the Wagu Beef item, it was almost like the flakes of a croissant wrapping pieces of wagu beef in truffle oil.... it was to die for! obviously we ordered 4 or 5 of these, but everything here tasted very good, this just won us all over. The bakery looks absolutely delicious, although the deserts tasted good, it was nothing amazing in our opinion. It did satisfy, but not to the exceptions left after the food.

The quality of food was pretty good.Another thing I liked was that, while this is a Michelin-starred restaurant, I didn't feel out of place wearing jeans and a fairly casual shirt. I don't like dress codes. I come from a city where frankly, restauranteurs are lucky to get people to arrive wearing trousers at all.Service was a bit slow, and our final bill came out to just over \u00a3115 for the two of us--\u00a3100 without the beer--so you should expect your wallet to feel a bit lighter after eating, but it's definitely worth it if you want to treat yourself.

In 2005, Yauatcha earned a Michelin star. \u00a0I believe Yauatcha is deserving of the rating. The restaurant serves a wide range of teas that pair perfectly with any of the beauties in the elegant p\u00e2tisserie at the entrance. You are immediately greeted by a gorgeous case of chocolate truffles, macarons, and petit g\u00e2teau. The dining area downstairs feels like a very hip night club decorated with tiny lights, colorful orchids, and the bar has a lovely tropical fish tank. The service was excellent and the food was amazing. I had the prawn and bean curd Cheung Fun and the Spicy Soft Shell Crab with almonds. \u00a0For dessert, I had the coconut mousse with tangy lime curd, and coconut pandan cream. This restaurant came highly recommended by my aunt and uncle as one of their favorite restaurants in London. I agree...I loved Yautcha also. Reservations are recommended. \u00a0yauatcha.com & @YauatchaSoho",

The place was swimming with people, as well as fishies in an enormous tank that stretches across the bar downstairs, stylishly decorated for a nice ambiance. As a group, we had the Yauatcha Signature set menu. As a Cantonese person judging an upmarket Cantonese restaurant, I found the food was tasty and delicately prepared, but the portion size was not particularly generous at \u00a360 a head for 8 people. At that price I had expected perfection but was disappointed by the two plates of desserts (one per group of four) dishing up slightly different sweets. (It looked like an error that one plate had duplicated chocolate pudding while the other plate had four distinct offerings - small things, but alas I have high expectations!). The restaurant offers a good selection of wine, including Camel Valley from Cornwall, and the a la carte menu looks alluring and attractively priced. If I come back again I would definitely stay away from the set menu, but then again I would probably feel more at home in a less grandiose venue...",

    "text": "In short, I think Yauatcha is over hyped and over priced. Positives:- Design and atmosphere: very posh, intimate, nice lighting, nothing like a loud traditional dim sum place- Wine list: most extensive wine list I've ever seen in a dim sum place, they also have a trendy looking bar- Dessert bar: they look like works of art, just so pleasant to look at. The rest is not as jolly: On this bitter cold night I decided to reward myself for walking around Oxford University all day by coming to Yauatcha. I've heard so much about it and there are more than 100 reviews with an average of 4 stars, it's about time we meet ;). So I decided to examine the place by the 4 basics:- Shrimp Chang Fun- Chicken feet- Pot stickers- Gai Lan (Chinese broccoli)Food wasn't bad, but not among the top of my dim sum billboard either. Chang fun was smooth, but the prawns were a bit fishy (could be the a different kind from what I'm used to). Chicken feet were a little too sweet and too greasy (they usually are). Pot stickers were okay, not enough meat in the stuffing. And gai lan. Oh the garlic gai lan, it's very good but considering it's just steamed vegetable stir fried with garlic, there's no way it should cost more than 8 bloody pounds! \u00a0That can buy me 2 lunches! 3 from Tesco! Most authentic dim sum place will serve you tea for free. Not at Yauatcha, where they have a big tea menu with fancy names. While I'm in no position of judging the various English tea, \u00a0I know my Chinese green/black/floral tea pretty well, and that Pu Er served with no tea leaf is definitely no more than mediocrity (hence is not worth 5 pounds). In the end I was full and my craving was somewhat resolved. But the sum wasn't so dim - it ended up being a 35 pounds meal. Ouch. Although the cakes looked lovely, I had no stomach or budget to try any, if I ever return it'd be for the desserts. It's not surprising to me though, knowing that this place is created by Alan Yau, who also created Wagamama. Basically his target is Asian food for non-native Asians, and I don't blame him, the market is big and margin is fat. \u00a0I should have known better. I do, however, take objection to the fact that this place was rated two Michelin-star. It does not deserve it, and it made me believe that nowadays Michelin rating is more an indicator of the price, not the food.",

The vibrant atmosphere sets the tone that this is a place where one can let your hair down whilst enjoying some great food and drinks.The lichee cocktail was great and the waitress was especially attentive when suggesting items from the menu. Our group was divided into two non - veggie meat lovers and 5 veggies. So, it's interesting to see how our relevant dishes went down. The non -veggie seafood dishes are Amazing ! Our favorite was the dim sum shrimp with beancurd and the prawn toast balls ( which we re-ordered) . Other dishes we tried included chicken noodles , jasmine tea ribs , scallop din sum and a few others , all great. Our vegetarian companions largely enjoyed their dishes too, apart from two that not one of our party , including the non- veggies very much disliked. Truffle is normally something that all of us enjoy , but not this time - the truffle flavored dim sum was awful and the taste just felt wrong ( for all 7 of us ). Likewise we had the same issue with the truffle spring rolls. We could not place it but something was not right as these dishes did not impress and left an awful taste and the gooey texture did not help. The manager was very accommodating and did not hesitate to remove the dishes from the bill , a gesture of goodwill which was much appreciated. Aside from the strange tasting truffle dishes we all love this place and my suggestion would be to try each and every one of the seafood dishes , appetizers and mains as these were fantastic ! If it wasn't for the truffle experience, this place would have got a 5 for sure .",

Craving Asian food in a sea of fish n chip restaurants and pubs, my travel buddy convinced me to give this place a shot. FOOD: 1) Lotus wrap-Standard dim sum, but very good. 2) Jasmine tea braised ribs-Ahh the famous tea braised ribs! I found the ribs to be good, but since it was served without rice, it tasted almost overseasoned with sauce. We ended up ordering white rice, which took ages to arrive, and the rice ended up being dry. Overall, a good dish, but did not live up to the hype for me. \u00a03) Pumpkin puffs-My absolute favorite part of my experience. Presented as 3 mini orange pumpkins, the exterior is fried mochi (a little firmer than ham sui gok). When you crack open the puff, the inside has pine nuts and shredded duck. The interior is similar to the inside of a pumpkin- stringy with seeds. The taste was amazing and the design was so creative. It was very memorable!SERVICE:The hostess was friendly and seated us when our table was ready. The server was constantly unavailable. After putting in our orders, he never came back. Different servers brought us food and we had to flag down a random server to order rice. By the time the rice arrived, the braised ribs were cold. We should have cancelled the order. No one checked up on us. We had to flag down a server down to bring us the bill. In a nut shell: Mediocre service, good food.",

We have one of their locations opening in Houston so had to taste their prime restaurant first. Reservations were made through OpenTable so it was fairly easy when I tried. We were greeted by the hostesses and brought down to their lower level dining area. Nice atmosphere. \u00a0Looking at their menu, it had so much a variety and different twists on traditional dim sum. My bf and I were so stoked. We ordered the Scallop Shu Mai, Lobster dumpling w/ tobiko, king crab dumpling, traditional shu mai (pork & shrimp), prawn cheung fun (shrimp roll wrapped in a clear rice layer), \u00a0and curry taro cake. The presentation for each dish was beautiful, they all looked so tasty. However, actually eating it... very mediocre. Maybe my taste palette is different from the dim sum I'm accustomed to, but the price and the hype didn't really justify what I tasted. Everything tasted exactly what it is. The lobster dumpling just tasted like pieces of lobster, the kind crab tasted like bits of king crab. The curry taro puffs were more overwhelming with curry than taro. The shrimp roll was ok... Very plain and bland. Scallop shu mai tasted like scallop. Even the traditional shu mai was ok... \u00a0All of them tasted like what it is, but nothing more. All of the ingredients did taste quite fresh, but it lacked so much in the flavor department. Quite disappointing. Did not get a chance to try any of their desserts. Service was good.",

    "text": "I did not have dinner at Yauatcha but visited the shop part of the restaurant where they sell their pastries. I hesitated a lot but finally decided on the milk chocolate and jasmine mousse with honey panna cotta one and it was delicious. The mousse was very light and the panna cotta soft, the chocolate cake moist and the addition of the popping candy was delightful though I wish there had been a bit more. Entremets often lose on texture and taste because of the gelatin they use to make them but this wasn't the case and I could have eaten another one of these right away!Service was perfect, the lady described all of the cakes and answered all my questions while I was trying to decide and even offered to let me sample a raspberry and chocolate macaron which was out of this world!You can go in there with your eyes closed and I will be looking forward to an occasion to eat at the restaurant, even just for the dessert.",

    "text": "It may not look like much from the outside but as soon as you enter Yauatcha you're in for a treat. As you wait for your table to be set up you can see all the luxurious dessert available from their dessert counter; this is surely enough to heighten up your anticipation of what's to come. My party of 6 was led downstairs into a sparkling underground dining area lit up with life-like (but actually fake) candles and twinkling lights on the ceiling that mimic stars. Yauatcha achieves what Hakkasan and Hutong fail to do, which is to create a special twilight-like atmosphere without plunging the restaurant into darkness; testament to this is that photos can still be taken with the utmost clarity whereby all the natural colours of the food are proudly visible.So, the first impression Yauatcha achieves is certainly promising, but what of the meal itself? Well the menu is an issue...the issue is, there are so many fabulous options to choose from! Plus you are mindfully conscious of the fact that you want to leave enough space in your stomach to consume at least one of the delightful desserts you've just seen and etched into your brain. However, one of the fabulous benefits of dining with a group of friends is that you have a greater capacity for ordering more, feasting your eyes on more and trying out more.The Duck Roll had a suitably crispy but light exterior with a satisfyingly meaty filling. The Scallop Shuimai was delicately soft with a quality offering of roe on top. The Siew Long Bun dumplings were tasty but easily split, letting out the juice of the dumpling - which is one of the cardinal sins of this type of dumpling; but it is hard to get these perfect. The Wheat Squid was so very well flavoured with dried shallots, garlic, spring onion and chilli peppers that I found myself lapping up all these extra bits until my tongue was burning from all the spice (- so be warned not to get carried away with polishing this dish off). The Beancurd and Prawn Cheung Fun had a beautifully smooth exterior around a crispy beancurd layer encasing a juicy prawn filling. The Crystal Pumpkin Dumplings were an attractive orange colour and delicately handcrafted to give one of the most original versions of dumplings that I've ever seen. The\u00a0Seafood Asparagus dish was another fantastic creation, with sweet scallop and prawn amongst crunchy carrot and asparagus, all spilling out of a beautiful rice cracker shaped like an oyster. Probably the only dishes that were unexceptional were the seafood noodles and vegetarian noodles which were satisfactory but indistinctive and Yauatcha's attempt at vegetarian duck which was a good effort, with the texture of the duck and seaweed being a nice touch but the overall taste being a bit too salty.The meal and experience of Yauatcha would not be complete without trying their dessert. As mentioned from the offset, the dessert on offer is enough to make your mouth water and your eyes widen. At this stage of my indulgent meal I was still able to spoil myself with one and a half desserts. The Exotic Pandan Dessert is a remarkable construction of thin layers of pandan cake, cream and mango filling with a shiny delicate gel on top that exhibits an intricate design. The cake is also accompanied by a dollop of smooth mango sorbet and the whole dessert is decorated with delightful titbits. The pear almond dessert was beautifully put together with the a smooth pear-flavoured layer on top of a quality biscuit base alongside a helping of nuts, a dashing of cream, a couple of pretty petals, a dollop of coffee-flavoured ice cream and a musky dessert sauce on the side. Needless to say, the desserts that Yauatcha serves up are truly a treat: with intricate designs, great colour combinations and a creative combination of textures and taste.\u00a0As you can see, the whole dining experience at Yauatcha was exemplary and to top it all off, our waitress, Marjorie, was the most patient, accommodating, efficient and genuinely friendly waitress that I can ever remember having at any restaurant. The only mini-annoyance I have is that we were billed for the still water (one bottle of Still Water = \u00a33.90) and not forewarned about this (which unfortunately can happen in restaurants if you don't check beforehand when they ask you if you want water). So, this aside, Yauatcha is for sure a restaurant to visit if you desire excellent quality Chinese food with original ideas and authentic Chinese recipes complementing each other at every turn. The desserts are sublime and the array of drinks well concocted. The location convenient, the atmosphere positive and the service as perfect as you could hope for.",

I would book if I wanted to take more than 4 people though. I found the tables a little uncomfortable when sat at them but not something that would prevent me coming back.The service is high end, with the staff being very attentive and 100x more friendly than your usual Chinese (get em in, feed em, get em out) restaurant. The food is probably one of the best dumpling places in central London, they have a great selection and its all made to a high quality. I also like the small quirky takes they have on classic dishes. The best way to sell this place from me is... I don't really like Chinese food but I can always be persuaded to come here (especially is someone else is paying!)",

The latter definitely suited the place, which is dark, seductive and framed by blue neon lights.Yautcha does tea well (on street level), complete with great cakes, but this place comes alive at night. Each time I've been there, I've sat downstairs, where the tables are packed in, but it still doesn't seem crowded or uncomfortable.The best food on the menu is the dim sum (the steamed mushroom dumplings are to die for, and I love the venison puffs), though there are larger Asian dishes and curries if you fancy something more hearty. Make sure you have a dessert as well. I had a ginger and white chocolate cheesecake that knocked me for six for a while as I floated away in a pudding-induced daydream.The waiters do a fantastic job of recommending dishes if you're unsure (the first lunch I had here, one of the guys just brought us a selection of their best dishes and man, it was good).Not exactly cheap (I could probably get just-as-good dim sum at Ping Pong - which I prefer as a destination), you're paying again for the place itself. The swanky designer decor, the attentive service and the oh-so-hip atmosphere. That said, I think it's worth it as the food is yummy and it's the sort of place you feel happy having a long conversation-fuelled dinner in and not being rushed.I'll definitely be going back, if anything just to try the cocktails (the list looked intriguing, but my dinner guests weren't drinking).

Decor and atmosphere was on the too painfully hip side of things, especially in the loungy downstairs room where we were seated. Low tables and low padded chairs felt a bit like sitting at the kiddy table. Otherwise, I suppose you are getting your money's worth, as the tab will reflect the quality of the surroundings ;)The large menu of overly flowery, fruity, asian-themed cocktails seemed to highlight their mixologists' importance, but didn't interest me much, especially at 9 quid a drink, but what do I know, the young gals at the other tables were having quite a few.Well, the eats - dim sum and other Chinese dishes were executed quite well, with authentic, distinct and varied flavors. A number of interesting and unique variations on dim sum were pretty good, especially fried and pastry items, like duck pumpkin puff. Haute dim sum, I suppose. Didn't have dessert, but after reading other reviews, glad I didn't, as it seemed they used to do much better sweets. On the way out spied some plated asian BBQ short ribs in the kitchen that looked tasty, we missed out perhaps?Almost 4 stars, but quite average service and the steep prices keep me from getting all the way there. Plus, I was getting such a pre-recession posh vibe from this joint, for dim sum and Chinese food, of all things, but maybe that's just me.",

Booking a table is advisable as both floors are packed, though if you go for lunch, it will still be busy but you will get a table. \u00a0My first visit a few years back, I booked a table and still ended up sitting on a large round table with a few other couples, which was fine, but I did want my own table, especially as I booked.The d\u00e9cor is modern with massive fish tanks and black marble floors. The service is typically first class by the Japanese and the food is exquisite, on my last visit I had venison puffs, which were great, Ostridge dumplings, great! I didn't like the whole fish I ordered, which was haddock, at \u00a330! The spicey squid and rice sticks were delish. They have a great dim sum too. Everything is expensive but you will definitely attentively waited and the food will be great. One downside is that on my last visit, me and two friends booked a table, but we still had to wait 20 minutes or so, they gave us the menus so we could get ahead of the game, and I didn't really like that, they really are so busy. On leaving the restaurant, you can buy some goodies or teas and herbs to take home, the shop is right next to the exit as if it were a museum, but they do have some nice deserts to take home.",

    "text": "About a year ago I was at Yauatcha with some friends, and someone got to wondering whether Yauatcha had ever had a Michelin star. \u00a0There was some disagreement (some thought it still had a star), so we eventually asked a waiter who, after leaving to consult colleagues, eventually returned with the news that at that moment, Yauatcha was still the holder of one star, but that it was uncertain whether this situation would continue for much longer! \u00a0Evidently the fate of the restaurant did not rest with that curiously pessimistic member of staff, for the 2010 list is now out, and Yauatcha still has its star.I revisited a few days ago, and whilst Yauatcha is perhaps not the restaurant is once was, it's still got some pretty good moves. \u00a0The dim sum is some of the best in London, and whilst not cheap, it can be surprisingly good value: it's very much possible to drink tea and eat well for \u00a325, which is perhaps \u00a310 more than an acceptable dim sum you might get somewhere else. \u00a0(I've only ever eaten dim sum at Yauatcha; other dishes will be more expensive.)The food is recognisably traditional, though with a few twists--venison might replace beef, for example. \u00a0The presentation is pretty good, even for menu items that sound uninspiring. \u00a0Dim sum is not for the truly timid, but although chicken feet are on the menu, there's plenty of safe dumplings and ribs and buns, etc. to be had. \u00a0The mushroom cheung fun (mushroom wrapped in a loose noodle sheath) is close to twice the price of the meat and seafood variations, but well worth it. \u00a0The deep fried squid was also excellent.The decor is nice and staff are pleasant. \u00a0Neither is intimidating. \u00a0It can be noisy, and isn't suited for long, lingering meals. \u00a0As other reviews have mentioned, the dramatic cake display upstairs has disappeared--a loss.Four stars--I'm a fan, and I'll be back.",

Walked in around 6pm on a rainy Sunday evening and were seated only after some fuss and the promise to leave within an hour and a half despite many empty seats available.Next, ordered two appetizers, but the waiter (who didn't seem to understand English well enough to not mess things up) brough three - one of which we had not ordered. He didn't apologize or offer to take it back. All three appetizers were underwhelming: chicken steamed shu mai, pork buns and something else we had not ordered. Greasy and not particularly great flavors.We then ordered fried rice with long beans, which for ten pounds I expected would be delicious, but was greasy and tasteless. Beef in black bean sauce - greasy and chewy. We took a couple of bites but didn't want anymore of it so asked if it could be packed to take away. They said no- they don't pack food to take away.Overall a very very underwhelming, over priced experience with cold staff. Would not return.",

The service is really efficient and pleasant - never pushy, always attentive and precise. A huge range of green, blue, and smoked teas are available and the staff are always happy to recommend something that goes well with the food you've ordered. The food is classic Chinese fusion but steers clear of the outlandish or merely sensational. Quality and flavour is the keynote. To finish, select gold leaf topped violet and rose flavoured cakes or light chocoloate mousses topped with lime flower and candied cinammon. Just looking at the cakes makes you think you've gone to some kind of food heaven. Innovative cocktails and soft drinks complete the 'event' that each meal here inevitably becomes. It's a treat.",

I let my friends order whatever the felt was right and they did a damn good job. Highlights were Salt and Pepper squid, Deep fried Quail (it was like posh KFC - fatty and sweet and brilliant) and the sea bass and crab dumplings were pretty amazing too. This is the best Chinese food I've eaten in London. There's a great atmosphere. It's buzzy enough to be fun, but dark and quiet enough to be romantic if you wanted to come here with your other half (and it would impress on a date as well - take note people). Cocktails are amazing. Huge. With flowers in and stuff. But you don't get drunk. You drink them because they're yummy. They do a ginger mojito thing which is great. I love it here. I really love it here. It's not cheap - drinks and dinner will set you back about fifty quid a head (although I reckon if you were a couple it would be much less as you wouldn't order so many dishes between you - maybe about \u00a330?), but it doesn't matter once you're here. It's all worth every penny. Can someone please take me back there?",

The atmosphere is so much more different to those you'd find not too far away in Chinatown, a combination between dark wooden panels, bright blue colours and a very colourful fishtank (I'm assuming filled with tropical fish). The dim sum is definitely of a much higher standard with some different twists including a number of dumplings with game meats in them. Of course, you will end up spending a little bit more on dim sum compared to other places, but it's great for something out of the ordinary. Their tea selection is also significantly different for those that want something other than the standard Chinese selection.",

Quite often I taken friends there on a Saturday at about 3 for a late lunch. I usually order a couple of other plates of dimsum and then share the tea.

The variety of tea leaves available is huge including hand rolled ones as well!One downside of this restaurant is the service.

My favourites include the pork and prawn shui mai and the simple chive dumplings. There's also a number of different types of teas on offer, unlike other places.

The drinks menu also offers a wide choice but the main attraction, for me at least, are the beautiful desserts that they have. Glorious creations beautifully presented and, though at \u00a34.50 each, they are a bit pricey one bite will assure you that it's worth it You can also by desserts to take out which is perfect for any special occasion or indulgent snacking.As stated, prices aren't cheap but not overly extortionate either. Service can be a bit slow considering the wealth of staff that they employ but on all occasions I've been there staff have been very helpful, offering suggestions to compliment choices rather than to run up the bill.Definitely a place to try",

    "text": "Hot on the heels, okay well two weeks after, of Yauatcha being sold by creator Alan Yau to a subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority I decided to finally check out the dim sum on offer by the restaurant. The premium price tag on the dim sum has previously prevented us from treating this place as an every day dim sum dining experience but we thought we better get in to check it out before there was any change to the formula that has so far proven to be a major success for Alan Yau. Blue is the overriding colour when you first behold the sight that is Yauatcha. Upon entering the restaurant you will see before you an elegant brightly lit modern and cleanly designed room. I'm not sure if bookings are still essential but today at just after noon we were able to dine as walk-ins. We were actually taken downstairs today where there is still a theme of blue from the frosted glass that covers the kitchen and the chefs to the long aquarium running across the front of the bar filled with bright colourful goldfish but suddenly we were plunged into darkness - a Ping Pong-ish style of decor. The service is as you would expect in a restaurant of this calibre - efficient, friendly and accommodating. Upon first sitting you are presented with the drinks menu which is an almost overwhelming list of teas and wines. You won't find bottomless pots of simple tea here - not like the pots of tea you get at regular dim sum places at any rate. There's a large variety of blue tea, black tea, green tea and flower tea on also. Not to mention they also have a wide selection of iced teas amongst which I can recommend the Lime and Passion Ice Tea which is my dining partner had and the Melon Ice Tea - both of where were extremely refreshing. The dim sum menu features some of the regulars such as Har Gau, Shumai, Cheung Fun, and Steam Pork Bun. There were also a number of items I'd never seen before on a dim sum menu a couple of which we tried out including Ostrich Dumplings (quite delicious and self-saucing) and Baked Venison Puff (very similar to Barbecue Pork Puff but obviously with venison.) As the prices were quite high we couldn't be too adventurous but it would have been interesting to try other dishes such as Chilean Sea Bass Mooli Roll, Native Lobster in Black Bean Sauce, Wagyu Beef Cheung Fun, and Box Dumpling. We couldn't resist the Jasmine Tea Smoked Organic Ribs, which we also sampled when we went to sister restaurant Hakkasan. They weren't too bad but not nearly as tasty or fall off the bone as the ones from Hakkasan. The price tag for our one meal today would have bought us two meals at any other restaurant but it was worth it to check out the hype that is Yauatcha.",

However, it won't be long before it needs a refit, as I'm sure it will begin to look a bit dated over the next year or two. So, you may not want to believe the hype, but give it a go.

All the pastries are amazing and they seem to introduce something new and innovative every few months. Perfect for my regular quarterly visits.
