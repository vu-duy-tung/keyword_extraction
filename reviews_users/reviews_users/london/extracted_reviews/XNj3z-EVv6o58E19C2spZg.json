    "text": "Ok, so I try to write balanced feedback as if it were a performance review, but Locale makes it hard. \u00a0Two nights ago they broke every customer service rule there is, and the food isn't close to good enough to make their bad attitudes ok. First impression at the door..hostess looked up at me but did not greet or acknowledge me. She walked away..then came back, as I'm about to walk out she asks how can she help. I ask for a table and am told it will be 30 minutes even though there are 5-6 empty tables and only one group waiting in the bar. BTW..its 9ish on a tuesday not exactly the busiest time. \u00a0I have a seat at the mostly empty bar and both bartenders take turns looking at me but not serving me. Finally the first bartender asks if I'm ok and i look at the empty bar space in front of me and say \"no, I'd like a beer. Moretti please\". He walks into the kitchen and does not return. 5 minutes later the other bartender asks if I need something and I said yes..I'd like the beer I ordered five minutes ago. I sipped the beer and watched the chef yell at another hostess in full view of customers. \u00a0Now..I'm torn at this point because the service IS pretty bad but you don't scream at employees in front of customers..EVER. I consider walking out again but have a half beer so I wait. Finally I get a table. Server barely speaks English and bumps into me every time she comes and goes from the table. The caprese has almost no basil, the pasta is not fresh, the tomato sauce is watery, some of the shellfish has not opened (ie...dead). \u00a0The food isn't terrible but is not good either. \u00a0Not a single smile from anyone the entire time. Do yourself a favor..skip Locale. There are plenty of rude waiters at other restaurants in London who at least serve good food.",

The crowd is mostly made up of nearby media people. That's why I have been there so often and know it pretty well. It gets pretty noisy and fills up with the smell of fried food around 7pm. Usually calimari. It's an OK place to fall into if you are working or wandering nearby but it is a transient place and not somewhere you would get all dolled up and go to at the weekend. If you are looking for a job in the media then you should go here and eavesdrop and wear a sandwich board saying you want to work in TV and hand out your CV as people pass in and out of the unisex toilets. Just make sure you don't hand it to the staff from St. Thomas' Hospital though as that won't help you get a job in tele. Oh and why people throw toilet paper onto the floor when there are bins is beyond me. Must be something to do with unisexuals.",

It was very nice, especially the zucchini fritti, but what really made this place were the staff. I dont think I have ever come across a more freindly and welcoming place. The bar staff came and chatted to us and everyone was genuinely freindly, without it feeling forced or fake. I really loved it and for a Saturday night it was nice and quiet in the bar. This is a real hidden gem I'm loathed to tell anyone about it but in all honesty they deserve the praise, I would rate it a 4.5 stars but since I cant they definately deserve a 5* rating. Grazie mille Locale, ciao e arrivederci",

    "text": "Locale was a last-minute choice for us, as it was close to the Marriott County Hall and in the middle of a downpour anywhere close was preferable! The first thing that struck us as we walked in was the wonderful aroma of freshly-grilled beef. The kitchen is a long, thin slice of the restaurant, and is open to view from the dining area. The restaurant itself is quite stylish, with beautiful looking, waif-thin waiting staff of both genders. Service itself was reasonably quick and efficient. However, the food itself was a mix in terms of quality. As starters, Gerry chose the Calamari, and I went for the Salude Miste - a mix of Italian cold meats served on Sardinian flatbread with tomato salsa and shaved fennel. The calamari was pretty generic, tasting like it was pre-purchased (and not a patch on that at Ha-Noi Cafe in Abingdon) and as for the Salude Miste - sadly, that was a triumph of style over substance, with the meats lacking flavour and the bread dry and dull. However, the meal was rescued by the main courses. My pizza Frutti Di Mare had a wonderful crisp base, and a fantastic tomato and basil sauce with the fresh basil shining through. The seafood was fresh-tasting and lively, while the capers were thankfully not over-used! Gerry's dish - short, thick pasta with an italian sausage ragu was tasty and a far cry from a usual bolognese sauce. We had other things to do, so we skipped dessert - and this was probably a good thing, as the two courses with a couple of glasses of wine was a total of \u00a358 including the (already added) 12.5% service charge. Overall, this was a reasonable meal, with nothing that really provoked complaint - but if you are going to spend \u00a330/head on two courses, even in London, you can do much better.",

This place was truly a disaster and I have never been so MISLED in my life. I found your restaurant with \"London Eye views\" on Trip Advisor when planning my short stay in London. I didn't realize London Eye views translated to Marriott scaffolding. My family and I were willing to overlook this disappointment as the menu appeared to look legitimate. We started with \"Rosemary Focaccia\" (sour dough bread smothered in jarred pesto) & Burrata (served with Mexican tortilla chips?). Once again we were willing to overlook this as our entrees sounded delicious. Gnocchi al Gamberetti (described as in a white wine & garlic sauce with crayfish) & Filetto de Manzo. Wow was my sister surprised when her gnocchi came out in a jarred red sauce with \"crayfish\" that looked like cockroaches. The grand finale was the raw steak served over instant mash potatoes. I hope no one else ruins one of their 4 meals in London on this place. Cheers.",

    "text": "Stay away from the pizza or calzones! \u00a0Neither was notable other the lack of ricotta in the calzone and that the cheese used did not completely melt. \u00a0Oh. The calzone also had a strange fishy taste, which for ham was a bit off. On the positives, the bar staff was entertaining. Between some very demanding and peculiar customers (\"No! \u00a0My lime must be twisted the other way!! \u00a0*turns it over* and \"I don't care what the bottle says...that isn't the right whiskey\") their attempts at Tom Cruise's \"Cocktail\" moves were a miss but the loose ice cube became a \"GOOOOAAALLL!!!\" Not to be missed. And I enjoyed the Italian lager, Peroni (part of a Yelp deal). I'm sure the regular Italian food would have been good - make reservations else you will be relegated to the bar and not worthy pizza and calzone. Overall, prices seemed reasonable (especially for this tourist part of London), but if you want pizza, there are other places must rank higher despite this place being voted one of London's top 10 Italian restaurants in 2017.",

It's all too easy to pay far too much for too little served by surly restaurateurs who know they will never see you again. Locale had none of this. Simply put, after a long day of seeing the sights we had a great, reasonably priced meal right around the corner from our hotel. Service was excellent, the pasta was fresh, and the salads were refreshing. All in all a wonderful experience that I can highly recommend.",

We used up all the pizza crust to get the leftover sauce from each other's plates! We're a family of five and it felt great... Calamari was deliciously crunchy, my Seafood linguine was perfect, so fresh and not too sour. Every meal had a deep flavor, because they use house made tomato sauce. Kids loved their pizza, breaded chicken on pasta and meatballs. I'd say for a nice place like that, kids meals were very well priced and portioned. To top it all off, the waiters were just genuinely nice, even though they were extremely busy. Great place, I'd go there with family or just for a couples dinner again for sure!",
