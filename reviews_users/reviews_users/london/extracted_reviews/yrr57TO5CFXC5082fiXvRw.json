I had their Garfunkel's Breakfast -- which, to someone who normally avoids breakfast diners like Denny's or IHOP in the States -- was a blessing. The food is of good quality for a chain -- it's obvious to see that items are mass-produced and/or sent in packages to each franchise, but the preparation is good and the cooks perform their functions well.Service at this venue was also good -- my server was attentive and came by often to check on whether I needed more refills of my cappucino (free refills if bought with a 5.95GBP breakfast deal)! No complaints! It's a great place to go if on a budget or a time crunch.",

The history, the architecture, the diversity, the attractions, a lot of cool things.The food is not one of them.I hate to say it, but that stereotype about England having horrible food is kind of true. Unless it's an upscale restaurant, most of the average diners and cafes on the street are not that great. I'd take a Sonic above a Pret-a-Manger any day, sorry guys.However, I remember Garfunkel's, at least this location (which I believe is the one right by Trafalgar Square), as being above average. Their shepherd's pie was tasty, as were the chips (fries). They had a decent beer selection, and seating was nice inside and on the sidewalk. Their prices weren't too bad, although keep in mind this is London and buying a soda will cost you an arm and a leg.",

The waitress took about 15-20 minutes to come over and ask us what we would like to drink. \u00a0I order a Carbonara pasta, this pasta was false advertising. It tasted tangy and weirdly unsettling. The burger that my friend received tasted and looked like the bland burger that a child at school in America would be given for $1. Nothing was seasoned... I drenched my pasta in salt and pepper. We make it clear that we have finished eating. The waitress then takes about 20 Minutes to come over and ring us up. We ask to do a separate check from each other. She says \"we don't do separate checks but you can separate your checks with the machine.\" She immediately contradicted herself. Lol. We finally have completely paid and leave immediately, she got a \u00a32.20 tip. I would strongly recommend that while you are touring London you skip this restaurant. It won't add any pleasure to your experience and it might make you strongly dislike Trafalgar Square.",

It was okay (came with mashed peas which I thought was weird). I got the pie & mash which was mediocre. If you've read any of my other reviews, I almost always say good things about potatoes but I guess even potatoes won't do the dish any justice. It wasn't distinguishing, but still disappointing nonetheless. Chilli poppers were good and came with salsa that tasted like it came from a jar--the one you dip with your Doritos while watching American football or something. Oh, and I would come back to Denny's, however, my husband will really have to really be convincing if he wants me to eat here again... And I mean real magical type of convincing, so it's hardly comparable to Denny's (which I would rate three.five stars for the type of food).",

They evwn remade it and it came out the same. They were out of all pot pies no chick no beef. \u00a0Ordered southern fried chicken sandwich it was just 2 chicken tenders in a sandwich. Very sad sandwich. . The only dissent items was jalape\u00f1o poppers were okay. And \u00a0the french frys werw okay. In general just a shame and the manager should be fired.",

The service was a little slow, but not enough to complain. It was recommended by security at the National Museum, across the street and is definitely worth recommending.",

It was larger than we expected, but we finished it pretty quickly because it wasn't overly rich, just tasty. The staff were helpful and though it seemed like they were really busy, it didn't take too long to get service. I totally would recommend this place.",

I have noticed that servers in Europe are a lot more laid back compared to the U.S. at first it was weird but I learned to just enjoy my meals without hurrying. You can't ever go wrong with Garfunkels. It was a great experience. This location was very clean and friendly. Awesome of choices in their menu and affordable.",

My favourite part about this restaurant was the service. The staff were very friendly and prompt -- one of the best experiences I've had in terms of service. As many have already mentioned, this is a chain with a diner-type of feel, so come if you're looking for a casual, down to earth ambience. All in all, a good experience.",
