The pub itself is dark, thick and aromatic from the basement up to the bubbly beige sky above Soho Square. Inside it's typically viscous with people ebbing and flowing like the micro-currents in Ireland's famous stout, and there's more than just a little of Dublin packed in.As with a good Guinness, the Toucan refreshes best on a warm summer day, where the black stuff froths over the top and spills out onto the sun-baked pavements nearby. You'll find me here in the spills, evaporating my beverages through my solar-powered thirst.(you'd barely know it, but they do Magners and a few other drinks too)",

If that's what flicks your switch, then dive in and enjoy. Downstairs in the winter is great, no windows, and a real sense of escape from the real world upstairs at street level. The food is stuff from a cardboard box, warmed up in a microwave, and some of the staff aren't interested in giving you the time of day if Suggs in in the bar, I guess the \u00a34+ he pays for his pint is better than mine. Still a great pub, just a shame about the price.",

Most of its patrons drink outside which leaves a pretty empty pub inside to take a seat and enjoy all of the Guinness decor. My wife and I spent nearly every night of our recent trip here and I miss it already. If I ever travel to London again, The Toucan will be my first stop.",

If you were flat-hunting and walked into the Toucan with the words and here's the living room echoing in your ears, you and yours would exeunt flat stage centre, pausing only to hoof the teenage letting agent in the gonads. Barely room to swing a hamster. And, much like the Nellie, the Toucan's a summer boozer. If you're lucky enough to wander in and find a stool to perch yourself on, fine, but it's busiest in the warm weather when the patrons can all spill out onto Carlisle Street and the neighbouring Soho Square. It's very much an Irish pub: good draught Guinness, Harp on tap if that's your thing, and - last time I was there - plenty of lunches based around stew and colcannon. You know the sort of thing. Nice pub for summer. A bit sardine-tin for the rest of the year.",

It's not the smoking ban that has driven the drinkers of the Toucan out onto the street - its the fact that it seats about 40 and yet any night from Wednesday onwards it usually has about 200 people trying to get a drink. But don't let that put you off - it's a great place for a very good pint of guiness and has a very nice relaxed atmosphere to it. As has already been written - its probably at its best on a quiet afternoon or early week night when you can just sit and enjoy the atmosphere of the place, but its good fun at any time. Price is pretty much your usual Soho. The food when I've had it has been fine both taste and price - pretty simple stuff though. The toilets are not the bestbut the decor and the fact that this is a real irish pub not a theme one make up for the little issues.",

    "text": "Guinness afficionados will know that for the last few years, all the Guinness you buy is brewed in Dublin. They're very careful to say in Dublin, since St James's Gate, the current brewery for Guinness, is about to be closed down and used for housing or shopping or something, and the brewing of the black stuff will be taken to a big purpose-built metal shed somewhere in the outskirts. However, because The Toucan gets through so much of the stuff, it's always very fresh. And herein lies the secret why Guinness from The Toucan tastes better than any other Guinness you'll ever drink anywhere else in London. The pub's tiny. So you'll probably end up either perched next to the casks of Guinness which are piled up in the pub itself (see what I mean about then going through loads); or you'll be outside, drinking the black stuff* from a plastic glass which'll be freezing your hand off. I didn't know it did food before reading the other reviews. It does sell Irish crisps, though - the Tayto brand, which, fact fans, were the first crisps ever to work out how to flavour their crisps in more than one flavour. I've been many times, but only once have managed to sit inside. Most of the time it's full. Which is because it's very good at pouring Guinness. I'd recommend it. If you like Guinness. If you don't - I'd go somewhere else, in all honesty. It's actually dark brown. Hold it up to the light.",

In many ways the Guiness would have a lot to live up to with so much expectation, luckily there are no problems. the Toucan is not a place enjoyed at busy hours, rush hour and weekends tend to simply lead the masses on to the streets near Soho square. The beauty of the Toucan is its intimacy and there are few better places to have a drink alone or with AN Other during the day or on a quiet tuesday evening. The Toucan may well be a bit shabby, the toilets vile, occasionally some silly tourists come in order cokes, wine and half a Guiness for the Dad to stare at and take pictures. The ancient stereo invariably spends a good few hours skipping about before anyone realises and a few potty mouthed celebrities often prop up the bar. None of this should detract from a very charming little place, very small but with a heart as wide as the Thames. One of very few oasis in Soho.",

They have the standard Guinness branded pint glasses, but for the first time that I've seen they even had the similar Guinness branded half-pint glasses.The sign caught my eye when I walked past, it read \"Great Guinness, Good Food,\" capturing a funny attitude that their beer is incredible but the food is just decent.It is busy even on weeknights, but the attentive bar staff was friendly and fast. They were also laid back and took frequent smoke breaks leaving a casually unmanned bar. They accepted card with no minimum, and a pint of Guinness was \u00a34.80. That's a bit more than the average pint here, but once you try it you'll understand the difference is absolutely worth it, plus it is still 25% cheaper than an average Guinness back home in NYC (which comparatively tastes terrible)!",

Guiness extra cold is also a very good beer if into this kind of beer. Only problem is that it goes down too easily ;-) cheers",

If you're a Guinness drinker, there is no better spot. And it's nice to duck in here to get away from some of the annoying Soho crowds. I have fantasies about being invited to wild Soho basement parties with intelligent and hilarious people (in my mind, they're all smoking, though in reality that would make my eyes water and I'd have to go home early like a loser), and this place lets me pretend that I'm hip for, well, as long as it takes me to drink a few pints on that particular day.",

Maybe it is how they do it here, I am not sure, but it was easy drinking. A few locals on a Monday night, everyone talking about movies and a few jokes made it even better. Yay! I'm a fan.",

But the beer here is to die for. They have the Extra Cold as well, my preference (1 deg C lower temp). The kegs are obviously meticulously cared for in terms of temperature, exposure etc.You pay for this pleasure, though- 4.40/pint.Dinked them one star because of an occasional Irish locals-only vibe.",

Made the experience kinda sour. I mean, it's not like there were any other people in it at the time (we went early before the crowds hit and pour out onto the street).... so yeah... The third time I went with friends the bartender made fun of me because I tipped him. He educated me that tipping is not customary in the UK unlike in America... he did thank me at least, so that's why I didn't ask for it back... but he could have just thanked me without making fun.Not sure there'll be a fourth time...Gets 3 stars because of the outstanding Guinness... and I am not even a beer drinker, but love the beer here! Also, the 3 stars represents the average of my previous 3 visits.",

Top spot, great music on the ipod/CDs behind the bar and the owner is happy to take requests. Prepare yourself for sing songs, random dancing sessions etc. Great atmosphere and probably the best pint of the black stuff in London.",

Located in Soho, it really is a little piece of Ireland in London.There are about 6 Guinness taps and only a couple of taps reserved for other (obviously less important) beers. Usually it is the other way around, but not here. Even most places in Ireland aren't like that.The place is really dark and kind of feels like a cave. You could really forget about the outside world for a while if you wanted too stay there for a few hours.",
