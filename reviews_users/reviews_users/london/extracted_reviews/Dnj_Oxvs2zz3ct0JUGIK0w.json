    "text": "My expectations were managed as I have read a few reviews before my visit. \u00a0I have not heard of them and wanted to do a little bit of research first when my friend suggested the venue. \u00a0Although a lot of the reviews rated the food as mediocre or even overrated for a Michelin starred restaurant, I thought the venue (a converted chapel) should be worth a visit. \u00a0The interior is interesting, and I especially enjoy looking up to the ceiling. \u00a0However, the general decor of the restaurant is a bit too business like for my liking. It is pleasant and would be a good place for business lunches or dinners but I thought it could have done it up with a bit more character.Now the food. \u00a0My friend found this deal - 29 for two courses with a glass of Champagne. Not bad for dinner at a place like this. \u00a0Given it is in the City, it did not look very busy on a Sunday night and I suspect that's the reason they have the deal. \u00a0The menu offers 4 choices each for entrees, mains and desserts. \u00a0These were actually selected from their normal menu so I guess it is a good representation of the food served. \u00a0We all picked the Lasagne of Dorset Crab, beurre Nantais and pea shoots, which was recommended by our waiter. \u00a0Although it was not quite what I expected, I liked it. The sauce was rich and creamy and sat well with the crab meat. \u00a0For the mains, I had the Roast saddle of Welsh Lamb, pomme Anna & Madeira jus. \u00a0This one I thought was a mediocre effort. There was nothing wrong with it, but also nothing memorable either. \u00a0My friend had the Valrhona chocolate ganache, honeycomb & coconut sorbet for dessert and I tried some of it. \u00a0The chocolate ganache was extremely rich and I feel that the coconut sorbet was a bit too sweet to balance it out. \u00a0Also, the honeycomb being also quite sweet didn't go too well with the other two. But I thought the chocolate ganache was good. I have to say though that the waiting staff is extremely attentive and professional. \u00a0Overall, I would say it was a decent experience but don't think I will come back or splurge on a full meal. \u00a0Like many others, I was surprised to find out that it was awarded a Michelin star. To me, it lacks the innovation or that little spark that makes it stand out among so many other restaurants in London. \u00a0The good service though made it all together a nice dining experience.",

This converted chapel may come across as classy and somewhat pretentious but in all fairness it isn't. The prix fixe menu was excellent. To start I had mackerel on bed of vegetables with a caviar sauce. I followed this with salt beef brisket which literally melted. The texture, the flavours were to die for. This was resurrected with the most amazing strawberry souffl\u00e9. Suma cum laude. Must be done.",

    "text": "The City's old buildings, particularly the high-ceilinged banking halls, make superb dining venues, but they must be skillfully handled to ensure there's enough warmth and conviviality beneath the mullions. La Chapelle does this perfectly. A wonderful view of this superbly converted girls' school chapel welcomes you as you step in from freshly spruced Spital Square. My lunch guest was a mathematician who almost managed to keep me focused on synergy theory, but the bottle of Fixin recommended by the sommelier broke even his resolve and we settled into a marvellous meal of fois gras and leek terrine, wood pigeon, sea bass and a souffle of myrtilles. I have rarely eaten better, and the service was as excellent as the food. It's not cheap of course - \u00a3100 a head with a wine of that quality. La Chapelle is a new Galvin offshoot which shares a kitchen with the glitzy Cafe de Luxe where many diners - probably from Allen & Overy and RBS next door - eat at the bar.",

Dessert was the real kicker, the chocolate was rich and delish. None of this milky splodge. I believe it was a single origin chocalate. The coffee was lacking body and the milk badly textured. I would like to see kitchen managers take more interest in good coffee, I came for lunch and I didn't want wine at lunch. Coffee is as subtle and diverse as wine, a good barista is as important as accomplished somillier. The equivalent would be serving up Lambrini in a fine dinning situation. So because of the lack of care with coffee a loss of a star.",

The chateaubriand I had did not taste aged enough and tasted too mineral for my liking. The sides were elegantly presented but underwhelming on flavor. Presentation was fancy. The one thing that made us all laugh was the service. \u00a0We had a late addition we all made room for. But when the starters came out, there was confusion. Someone mentioned they got the wrong thing and the waiter snapped back with a scowl 'This is what happens when everyone moves!' \u00a0Not really. We only slid over one seat and the switcharoo was across the table. We were all a bit shocked at his attitude but laughed it off as he was young. \u00a0That pretty much sums it up for me. It has the form of a Michelin starred restaurant in terms of food presentation and decor but not really the substance in terms of flavor or service.",

    "text": "We actually missed this restaurant and hit the bar around the corner. Getting odd looks from the banker crowd, we were helpfully directed by the staff to the restaurant.The first impressions were stunning. The staff were extremely gracious and helpful. Despite us not being their \"normal\" clientele (think bankers and money ppl) they were on the LivingSocial programme so knew what to expect :)We were taken to our table, and you couldn't help but marvel at the interior. The high ceiling of a converted church. The liberal blending of modern and traditional features was just divine. Unfortunately whilst the interior was nice, the lighting was atrocious. Okay, I'm a massive instagrammer, and every picture during the evening came out a murky yellow. Whether this is their way of dissuading you of taking pictures, should you be that way inclined, it is best to get a lunchtime reservation where your pictures of the food would do it justice. Just to show you how bad, I've uploaded photos.The service is definitely one thing to highlight. Bread is constantly replaced, with staff coming to the table when either you're finished with bread or appear you want to order. Additionally, the Sommelier picked out some great wine recommendations which were delivered with our mains are requested. I know it's not a big deal, but many places just don't do this. Sure not all of them are Michelin starred.Onto the food, I was a little disappointed. Perhaps it was the range, seasonality of the menu, but it seemed restricted. There 5 starters to pick from and 3 were fish, with 1 vegetarian. They were nice, but having been to Brasserie Joel a week earlier no way as good as their duck terrine starter. The mains were in similar fashion. My pork dish had a sauce that was way to salty. And I say this coming from a family where soy sauce is used liberally. Again there was nothing special about the ingredients used. It was run of the mill pak choi, green beans and that sort of fare, easy to buy anywhere. Maybe I'm wrong, but when I go somewhere Michelin starred, \u00a0I want to be blown away and sadly I was not.Desserts were good, but again, the menu looked restricted. A frangipane and a chocolate ganache dessert. Sigh. They were good, rich, but nothing I couldn't have just bought during my lunchtime at nearby borough market. In all, if what you look for is excellent attentive service a very good sommelier but un-adventurous good then you'll like this place. Is it worth the Michelin? Perhaps No. But then again I know nothing about how these things awarded, apart from the fact, I've been disappointed with the two places I've visited that had been awarded them. I suggest this place is worth the price of entry on a Groupon, but unless the menu is substantially better for full-paying customers, I would much recommend Brasserie Joel that I visited a week prior.Another thing, I was pleasantly surprised by the number of american tourists at the venue, dressed in their bingo shirts and shorts. It was quite funny.",

The food and service was of the highest quality - which was to be expected. The starter was presented beautifully and tasted great. The main (I had chicken) was delicious - everything melted in my mouth, releasing an explosion of flavour simultaneously (especially the truffle in the gnocchi). I wasn't too keen on the dessert unfortunately - caramelised banana with chocolate mousse. I thought the banana would be warm (or even completely caramelised) but it was literally a big chunk of banana and given a touch of colour by means of using a blowtorch. The chocolate mousse was a tad sour (like a sorbet almost) so I didn't care for that. But I must say, the dessert was presented beautifully. On the whole, I would go back to this spectacular restaurant as I'm keen to sample something else from their wide range on their menu. Plus they have an extensive wine list.",

The quality was nowhere near as good as my last visit but that is to be expected from a deal. It is very rare to find a restaurant's set lunch/deal qualities can match its full price dinner menu, especially at fine dining level. But putting that aside, it was still a very pleasant evening and the staff were very professional so you don't need to worry about being treated like a second class citizen.",

    "text": "The reason why we came here was really amusing: After having a rather unsatisfying dinner, my friend popped in \"desserts near EC1\" in Google and this was one of the top results - so we just decided to go after having our dinner. It was weird telling the host that we only wanted desserts and they had this peculiar look on their face when it happened. Despite telling us that \"We don't normally do this,\" we managed to get a table and when we entered the restaurant we realised how overwhelmingly underdressed we were! Thank goodness the lighting was low - otherwise it'll have made me twice as self-conscious.The interior was so posh! Our chairs were seriously comfy and the service was good enough for us. Even though we were seriously underdressed, there was no weird stares or weird service from the waitstaff which is remarkable considering that my friend was given a once-over by a waiter from another Michelin-starred restaurant. I really liked the atmosphere and we were really comfortable having our desserts there. Now the dessert part: I was soooo tempted to order the Valhorna chocolate ganache since Valhorna chocolates are superbly amazing even for a non-chocolate eater like me. But in the end, I settled for the lemon curd with lavender meringue, pistachio sable and white chocolate ice-cream. The lavender meringue was amazing!! I had seriously bad experience eating meringue having tried my first at a university hall, so this was waaaaay better. The lavender meringue was crunchy and a little nutty but also retains that quality meringues have (sorry I can't really describe it, but just take it from me that it was good). The smell of lavender albeit strange (like eating your home fragrance) was really lovely and needless to say, this was my favourite bit of the entire dessert dish. The other dessert that my friend ordered was the banana souffle with passion fruit sorbet. According to them, they loved it to bits and would totally recommend it. One of my friends ordered the crab lasagne. Despite the oddity of the pairing, it was actually quite good! This dish comes recommended as well. Would totally go again to try the main dishes - hope it doesn't disappoint! (and this time, i'll try to dress better hehe)",

It just so happened that we found a deal for a 3-course meal and glass of bubbly on one of the deal sites which made the meal far more affordable. Once you are inside, the staff are exceptional and any worry about being treated as a result of being on a deal quickly vanish. Our waiter asked if we would like our bubbly to start and promptly brought it out followed by some bread. Being gluten-free they bought me my own selection of bread and a separate butter. We chose our food from the menu and I had chicken liver parfait to start followed by fish with cockles. The food was absolutely delicious and the ambience is wonderful. It was great to experience a wonderful meal, celebrating our anniversary is such an atmospheric setting. I can't compliment Galvin la Chapelle for the quality of service and food. Definitely an experience I will remember for years to come.",

The setting is really magnificent, but the problem lies with the food and the service.In detail: - One of the appetizers (tuna) had a very weird combination of spices, making it taste, well, weird. We couldn't even believe that such a dish left the kitchen. - The breads offered looked like they had been picked up from the Tesco express a few hours before. I know they weren't, but it was the only time in a Michelin starred restaurant that we thought something like this...- The mains were good, but they were what one could call crowd pleasers. Not much authenticity or creativity in display.- I don't understand the point of having such classics as tarte tatin and baba au rhum in the menu (especially when they are being serve in Cafe a vin next door for a fraction of the price)- The average waiter was 20 years old, they all seemed rather uncomfortable and inexperienced and when we expressed our opinion for the appetizer above, their look was more like \"well, that's life\".To summarize, if you want simple french cuisine, go to Cafe a Vin. If you want more serious french cuisine try something else (Club Gascon for example....)",

    "text": "(for full review \u00a0alswharton.wordpress.com\u2026)Overall Verdict: RECOMMENDED WITH MINOR RESERVATIONSSo for those of you who were following, I must confess I abandoned somewhat my 2011 quest to dine at all 23 of the Chicago restaurants awarded at least one Michelin star. See all reviews of the list here bit.ly/nGR9Vc ..... I was able to review over a dozen of these top spots from Michelin's guide.Frankly, I think the Michelin rating system is flawed at best and a fraud if you're really a cynic. And I know I will get in trouble for that, but I will save that for another post on another day. That said, I was quite bemused when I selected La Chapelle for dinner on the last night of my last stay in London as a \"visitor\"(1) and found it too was part of a family of restaurants that included Michelin stars. Despite my lack of faith in Michelin's ability to fairly pick quality restaurants without bias of marketing and fad, I stayed!As is often our preference, my partner and I decided on the tasting menu, in this case the Menu Gourmand. There is simply no better way to get a sense of a restaurant, sampling what the chef feels are his or her finest delicacies (or what was on sale at the butcher?' said the cynic). This tasting menu had seven courses ranging from a light lasagna to a meaty pigeon I'm afraid made me think of Trafalgar Square. Including cocktails, deserts and wine pairings, the bill for two of us came to around \u00a3350. And overall it was a fine meal.With consistant service, great food, a charming decor that allows for conversation and interaction whether with two or twelve, I rate La Chapelle a 4 out of 5 and RECOMMEND WITH MINOR RESERVATIONS. If dining with business colleagues, I highly recommend it. If dining out with good friends, going on a date or looking for romance, I would likely suggest somewhere else. The place is somewhat too business oriented due to location. Despite officially being in Spitalfields, you might feel more as if you are on Bishopsgate, the closest main street. So that's my reservation. I like food and I hate attitude. There are awesome restaurants like RIA in Chicago that are fantastic AND relaxed. I would recommend those types of places first.",

    "text": "Once a chapel, now these vaulted ceilings and Corinthian columns house one of the restauranteer-ing Galvin brothers' Modern French dining creations. Sister to Galvin Windows, La Chapelle is the more old fashioned and sensible sibling, featuring a more demure outfit overall. We came here for the set menu of \u00a335 for 3 courses, plus a cocktail 'Menu du Chef', an impressive stretch of resources and a mystifying move by the Galvins. I recognise that this is truly a bargain and that the food won't be of the same haute standards as a tasting menu or a la carte. However, it was still rather mediocre and the service was elementary. The servers were not very attentive and I sincerely hope it wasn't due to our special set menu. My companion was loosely kosher (ie no pork or shellfish) of which they were informed of weeks in advance but they didn't seem to know what that entailed in terms of dietary requirements. They took away the ham and replaced it with a vegetarian alternative but then didn't really carry through the theme into the next dish which had pork portions in it. The starter was parma ham with tomatoes in drizzled oil. So, yea. That happened. The main was a rosy and well cooked chicken with 5 gnocchi. Humdrum pairing and run-of-the-mill in flavour. I always get shirty when I feel like i can recreate a dish...particularly so if it's at a Michelin starred restaurant. Dessert was a creamy Brilllat savarin.So, overall, wallet intact but a bit disappointed.",

We skipped the appetizers and started straight with main dishes: I ordered the wild mushroom, parmesan and truffle risotto. It was divine! The texture, the flavors were perfect. Also, the quantity was just enough and not too much.We ordered some red wine ( amazing choice of wines by the way) which was a French one (perfect)Finally, we finished with desserts: the apple tatin pie for me. A classic but it was very good.I agree it's a pricy place but, the price worth the service, the quality and the quantity.

    "text": "!!!WARNING!!! MARJOR TOURIST TRAP.I and my parents are from the good ol' USA. We booked a table here a few weeks before dinning. We looked at reviews, read the online menu, and were very excited to dine here. Living in Portland, Oregon, there are no Michelin started restaurants to try, so we booked at this restaurant, thinking we would experience the meal of a lifetime. I actually think this was the meal of a lifetime, but NOT in a good way.Service: the service here is excellent. No complaints there. I have read many reviews stating that the service can be spotty, but this was not the case with our visit.Food: this is where the review takes a turn for the worse. The food was, to put it bluntly, TERRIBLE. To start, I had the chilled asparagus velout\u00e9, with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche & chervil. This was entirely bland and WAY too salty. Thought I am not an expert chef myself, and I am not a world renowned food critic, it was easy to tell that the chef must have either spilled far too much salt into the dish, or he has degenerative taste buds which do not allow him to detect appropriate sodium content. Next, I had the entr\u00e9e; their famous Risotto and spring vegetables. This was a whole new level of atrocious. For a mere \u00a330, one can devour a plate of salt, wishing to be saved by rice. Yes, this dish was even saltier. In fact, I could not taste much else. It is truly ridiculous that I was charged nearly \u00a330 for a plate of salty, texture less rice, with a little grass (iceberg lettuce) on top. RIDICULOUS. At the end, I was so disappointed, I nearly forced myself to enjoy the dessert (which was absolutely nothing special, but at least it was edible). All in all, the worst meal I've had in London (this is saying a lot as that day I had a severe allergic reaction to some street food). My family made a \u00a3154 mistake, but at least we know where not to go for a decent meal. I thought Michelin had standards, but if a place such as this can scrape up a star, those standards have fallen severely short.",

The staff is extremely attentive and friendly and our sommelier especially fun, not the boring serious type at all.And then the food and wine .... amazing really. We had a 5 course set menu, booked in advance via their own website and everything was just so good, tasty and beautiful. The wine suggestions were excellent and we especially all loved The Oddity white wine from Hungary but also the Banyul red dessert wine with the best dessert ever.Want to come back soon!",

We picked 2 starters off the ala carte menu and the 2 course set menu. The starters - crab lasagne and quail and foie gras presse were creative and elegantly presented. Mains were Sunday roast and hand-made linguine. Sunday roast beef was tender and juicy, but linguine was a little bland and dry. Service was top notch. I would recommend this place for the food, ambience and service.",

With these deals, I had the expectations of small portions and with the looks of this place, I thought the food would be small in portion and artsy looking that overshadowed taste. But actually, it was a swanky spot, gorgeous, super friendly staff, delicious food, and perfect portions. It was worth the deal and more! Went on a Thursday for the pre fix lunch w/bubbly. Started with the fish starter and it was bigger than I thought. Super tasty. Then for the main ordered the chicken. The gnocchi that was cook with the chicken melts in your mouth. For Dessert, had the mango w/tapioca. It was good, but I recommend getting the chocolate dessert option. Went for some tea after lunch...came with a couple small macaroons, chocolates, and marshmallows. It was so great to compliment the order of tea with these. Planning on coming back for the weekend live jazz lunch! Loving this spot!",

We also got a glass of bubbly which was quite nice. The starter and main were both super delicious; dessert was a bit rich for me but maybe I should have gone for the lighter cheese option.

The interior is immediately striking, beautiful with soft lighting, and a two storey ceiling adorned with a chandelier. Certainly has the wow factor!We opted for the 7 course tasting menu. Service was a bit slow to start, felt like there were lots of staff around but no one approached us until we prompted! Not a huge deal as they were super friendly after that.The food- goodness! Rich and indulgent and seasoned to perfection. See my photo for the full menu but highlights for me were absolutely the crab lasagne, a signature dish of theirs. Delicate and almost too pretty to eat but I'm so glad I did! The truffle risotto I could have eaten an entire bowl of quite happily, creamy and earthy with a delicate slice of black truffle on top! Dessert was a apple tart tatin which was sweet and crispy and served with a slightly sour cream for a nice cooling effect. Delicious!Would definitely recommend for a special occasion !",

We walked over from our hotel, got lost a few times but were delighted to finally arrive at this stunning beautiful converted school/church.The food was lovely. We ordered the cured organic salmon, foie gras, risotto and something else? I think lamb... Plus wine. The food was good but the service was huge problem. First of all, the staff was overly intrusive. They interrupted our conversation repeatedly (REPEATEDLY) in order to ask us things like if we wanted more wine... We were not (I repeat, NOT) allowed to pour our own wine and we did not appear to be drinking at a rapid enough pace to suit the staff. My boyfriend and I were having a very serious, in-depth conversation about business and it was seriously annoying that they kept interrupting us. The restaurant was not busy, they did not need our table - there was honestly no justification for their rudeness.After the 5th interruption, I finally said something to the staff. Trust me, they were really pushing my buttons for me to even say anything. But seriously, HOW DARE THEY INTERRUPT OUR CONVERSATION REPEATEDLY???? I mean, cutting off my boyfriend mid sentence over and over again. UGH. Horrific. I cannot imagine ever going to this place again. Michelin ranked huh? UGH.",

The restaurant is at the edge of Spitalfields Market and is inside of an old chapel and hence the name La Chapelle. There are several giant wooden chandeliers hanging from the soaring ceiling, bringing so much character to the whole place. The services were great, as usually the case in restaurants like this. They offer a very good deal of 3-course lunch for 29 pounds. I started with beetroot risotto. It had the lovely pinkish red color of beetroot and tasted delicious. My main was pork belly, which I didn't love. The meat was on the dry side and the skin was very hard to chew on. My last course, apple tarte tatin, however, made it all worth it. I think the apple tarte tatin here is easily the best in the city.I want to come back for dinner and try some other dishes and of course for the apple tarte tartin at the end.",

The tarte tatin was just perfect, sweet, fresh and crispy. To top it all of we were treated with some minimacarons & chocolate truffles.

Service was excellent, if a little haphazard at times (one of our several servers was a trainee who was a little too keen to take unfinished items away, and when I tried to get the attention of someone it took a while, but the place was very crowded by then). But the staff were all very professional, very friendly and efficient without being in the slightest pompous, even though the place exudes class, and in an absolutely beautiful setting.The 5 courses were overall excellent, although it would not be too hard to find minor fault with a couple of them (an extra piece of toast wouldn't have hurt on the first course, the delicious crab pasta could have been a little bigger, the chicken main was a little underwhelming compared to the other courses, and surprisingly a little under-seasoned, but a pinch of salt fixed that). The cheapest wine on the list, the tempranillo at \u00a319, was excellent.At full prices and a la carte it would be an expensive but no doubt excellent experience. At \u00a329 for the tasting menu it was a steal.",

It's definitely quite family oriented on weekends-- few couples were having a romantic meal compared to all the families with young children running around.My husband and I went to the jazz lunch they have on Sundays, and it was definitely one of the more pleasant Sunday lunches I've ever had. I had the chargrilled mackerel, kohlrabi, pomegranate & cr\u00e8me fraiche for a starter and it was perhaps the best mackerel I've ever had. My husband also loved his chicken liver & foie gras appetiser. We also had an excellent bottle of 2011 Croatian wine for a very affordable price (35 pounds-ish) that complemented the meal excellently. I can't say that the mains were as good as the appetisers- my husband had the vegetarian risotto and thought it was a bit too creamy and cheesy, and I thought my beef roast was somewhat unremarkable and overly heavy. I would definitely come back, but would almost certainly go back for the fish or game dishes instead; those seemed much more artisanal. The service was also a bit of a problem- we were not allowed to pour our own wine (unlike the people who had ordered carafes) and the waiters were not attentive enough to our empty glasses. Perhaps the only real downside to this is that they charge 20% of optional service, but when they bring you the bill, they do not give you an option to change how much service you'd like to pay, making you feel quite awkward. Service should really always be respective to the performance of the wait staff.",

    "text": "I was lucky enough to win a three-course meal for two at La Chappelle via competition. La Chapelle is the third restaurant opened by the Galvin brothers Chris and Jeff and is situated inside a beautiful converted Victorian school chapel with stunning high ceilings and wonderfully twinkly lights it was a breathtaking venue and definitely somewhere to impress.I was quite early for our 6:30pm reservation but they were quite happy for me to prop up the bar. I showed off my complete lack of knowledge by asking if they had a white zinfandel ros\u00e9 on the wine list but the bartender was more than helpful when I asked for the sweetest ros\u00e9 they had available and the one he provided me to taste (sorry I didn't think to get the name!) was delicious if a bit expensive - \u00a311.50 is not a price I would usually pay for a glass but as drinks were the only thing I was paying for that evening it didn't seem so bad. I was also provided with a small range of bar nibbles to keep me going until my friend arrived.Once seated we were given our glasses of champagne. It was a beautifully light bubbly champagne and exclusive to the Galvin brand of restaurants. For starter I had the Charentais melon & Bayonne ham with Castelanotti olive oil which was absolutely delightful. The melon was just the right ripeness and went beautifully with the ham. It was also a fairly substantial portion for a starter but I was more than capable of finishing at all as it was truly delicious.I was less enamoured with the main of roast supreme of corn-fed chicken, parmesan gnocchi, spring vegetables & mushroom consomm\u00e9 that I chose finding the chicken to be quite a rubbery texture and the consomm\u00e9 extremely salty. I didn't even come close to finishing this but after the starter I didn't need to to feel satisfied. The gnocchi was my favorite part of the meal.The highlight however was the pudding a buttermilk pannacotta with poached English strawberries & basil. It was creamy and smooth just like a good pannacotta should be with the strawberries just the perfect ripeness to boot. Despite the fact that I was struggling to finish it I made sure that I savoured each and every bite!We decided against teas and coffees instead choosing to finish off our champagne and wine while we chatted some more but there was still more to come and we were presented with the cutest little dish of petit fours; almond biscotti, pistachio macarons and dark chocolate truffles. Now I've never had anything sweet that tastes of pistachio before as I find it an extremely odd combination and so wasn't keen on the macaron but the biscotti and the truffles were to die for! As if that wasn't enough on our way out we were also presented with a small chocolate box with more complimentary truffles!It's truly somewhere you go for the experience of exceptionally fine dining.",
