    "text": "I'll be honest and admit that I had very low expectations for Jackson + Rye (yet another American-style eatery) when I went there last Saturday. I needed a place to eat a big meal in the middle of the afternoon to satiate me before seeing a five hour screening + Q&A of Nymphomaniac, and J+R's all-day brunch menu fit the bill. We ordered the fried calamari starter, the roast chicken, the fried chicken, a side of the tomato-basil salad, and a (very reasonably priced) glass of prosecco. The calamari was fair - nothing memorable. The roast chicken was surprisingly juicy and flavorful, and was the clear highlight of the meal. (Though the creamy dipping sauce that came on the side was coagulated and inedible.) The fried chicken was also well-executed. The tomato salad was a joke, unfortunately. It looked like they took a carton of Tesco cherry tomatoes, sliced them in half, and threw some old chopped basil on top. Shame on me for ordering a tomato salad in February, but shame on them for serving this dish.It is clear that two people can have markedly different experiences here, depending on what they order. Based on the dishes served to other tables, the fried chicken sandwich seems to be a popular option, as are the (poor-looking) American pancakes. If I went back I would probably stick with the roast chicken or potentially try an egg dish. I am giving this place three stars for the chicken dishes, which were enjoyable and reasonably priced.",

The widely regarded buttermilk fried chicken didn't disappoint and went well with the side of American mac & cheese. In fact, I could've done with MORE mac & cheese - maybe I'll try the starter next time rather than the side. The meatballs were an underrated dish; I always think it's hard to make meatballs exciting, but they did very well with their seasoning.The only boo-boo was the peanut cookies at the end were a bit hard like shortbread when they would've been a lot better chewy - it would've made a wonderful gooey mess with the milk ice cream.",

I ordered a portion of slab bacon on the side, which I found went well with the pancakes. The avocado Benedict was also a nice alternative for those who love avocado - this came filled with bacon bits as well.On my second visit me and my friend ordered a few to share. I liked the crab cakes which came with a side of slaw. A bit mixed about the prawn and grits, not quite sure I liked the grits that much, although the prawns were quite fresh and juicy.I have a sweet tooth and liked the blueberry cobbler, it's quite a big portion and I'd recommend it to share between 2.Food on the whole wasn't too bad, although I can't say the same about service. The waitresses weren't that attentive, and some didn't look very friendly. It took quite long for someone to come take our orders. And also a long time for our bill to arrive after we had requested it. Overall, a bit hit and miss...For a full post with photos, click here: dancing-in-high-heels.bl\u2026",

    "text": "Entrance here is bad, bad, bad...Despite that, as well as suspending my thoughts about previous reviews on this place here's my take on J+RI booked for my crew and we had a variety of things from the menu as well as the cocktails.As I said the entrance/reception area is a train wreck. Congested & people on-top-of each other. Please sort that out because it can be a turn off for those of us who take the time to make a reservation. With that said, YES, MAKE A RESERVATION!! I always get annoyed with people who complain about 'service or not getting seated timely' at venues like this that are in Soho and you know darn well that is touristville. BOOK AHEAD! I did & had no issues whatsoever.Onto the staff. I chose to wait for my crew before going to our table so the nice hostess offered me a seat at the bar. Friendly & attractive barmen, kept me entertained without deviating from service to the punters. Nice to be acknowledged.Table ready, we headed to the back. Oh, yeah...this place is not huge. I repeat, BOOK AHEAD! The front area comprises the bar and a few tables for those who prefer people watching. The back area is mainly booths and a few tables which I prefer because the ambiance feels more New York to me opposed to the Parisien front area.We ordered our free cocktails while the rest of my posse arrived and they didn't take forever to get to us either. I had the Duece Royale and it was refreshing and tasty. Right amount of kick for brunch too. My friends had the Black 'n Rye, Bloody Mary and Breakfast Sour - all good and at the right strength for brunch.We had the Shrimp & Grits, which was the winner for me; Angler's, Gardener's, Avocado Benedict, Crab Cakes, Garden Salad and Sea Bass. Everything was so good. Cooked well and service came with lots of smiles. All I can say is that the portions seem to be appetizer sizes, including main dishes. This wouldn't wash in a true USA brunch venue but for London, in Soho, I guess they can try this. Everything was flavourful, seasonsed well and so very filling. We even shared a portion of chips.Thanks to Jackson & Rye for a lovely afternoon.",

    "text": "Jackson + Rye is a fairly spacious place modelled along the lines of a upscale American diner and advertises hearty fare inspired by Southern US cooking as well as a range of cocktails and other boozes to get your day started. The d\u00e9cor is mostly small tables and booths and it feels more 1940s than anything else. \u00a0Staff are friendly, albeit a bit slow (or perhaps the place was understaffed on Saturday morning), and were quick to greet and exchange a bit of banter. J+R is a bit of a hit and miss on the menu. Given our group of 10, we managed to try out a hefty portion of the brunch menu and in general I think we were a little let down. The menu looks delicious from the shrimp'n'grits to the buttermilk fried chicken and let's not forget the truffled mac'n'cheese. The shrimp'n'grits actually were pretty damn good and reasonably sized and priced for an appetiser. The shrimp were a tad overcooked but the grits textured yet soft. I think a heavier hand with the cheese would have given the dish more oomph but not a bad start. The other half of my meal was the fried squid which looked more like under-cooked onion rings (I like a golden brown look to my batter not a pale tan). Still, they were tasty and the spicy sauce was excellent with a good balance of heat and tanginess. The GF went for the buttermilk fried chicken as we'd just come off a chicken high a few days ago with the Devonshire Arms's offering. Sadly, this must have been one of the scrawnier runts of the brood and lacked even the most basic of seasoning. If you do insist on trying the chicken, get the fried chicken sandwich as that has about 2/3rds the amount of meat but only costs half as much. You'd be better off getting two sandwiches and having more meat as well as a fairly tasty bun and some sauce for flavour.Although our waitress wasn't quite sure about the difference between a flat white and a cappuccino (and indeed looking at the two, I'm not sure the barista did either), the cocktails were excellent. I tried out the Black + Rye which was essentially an espresso martini made with Rittenhouse 100 rye and it was a perfect boozy brunch cocktail. At \u00a36, it's quite reasonably priced, particularly for Soho and a decent size - about the same size as Ape & Bird but for \u00a32 less.",

    "text": "This is really one of my favourite restaurants and bars in London, as it always delivers. Dinners here are always great, and the breakfast/brunch is also amazing. The place has everything going for it - great food, unique and tasty beers and drinks, nice ambiance and really helpful staff. They have great IPAs and other American beer. The bourbon menu is vast. Cocktails and drinks are really innovative and most importantly well-priced for the area.Yesterday we had the cornbread to share, really good with just the right amount of chilli. I had the truffle Mac and cheese for starter, and it was really filling, but most importantly just amazing truffle and parmesan taste. I savoured every bite. Then I had the southern style deep fried chicken breast with sweet potatoe fries. I love this dish and they make it into a sandwhich for brunch as well, but after the Mac and cheese it felt a bit heavy and I came down into a short food-induced coma as all the energy from my brain was diverted to the digestive system... I really wanted dessert but couldn't fit it in.... I should have probably taken something lighter after the Mac and cheese.They have a lot of steak, and I haven't tried them but friend who have say they have been great.Staff seems to be genuinely interested in working there and providing great service, everyone had a smile.Oh and when they are busy, you put your name on their iPad and they text you when a table comes free - so you don't have to wait outside but can grab a drink somewhere closeby while you wait. So really great place to stop by even when you haven't made a reservation. I wish every restaurant had this!",

Right at the front is a fantastic looking bar with an glamorous old school New York feel, and just behind it the restaurant opens up to a large seating area. For dinner I've tried the truffle mac & cheese, half lobster, avocado and bacon salad, and the reuben - and I'd be happy to order any of those again! For breakfast I've only ever tried the avocado benedict, which I love. Weekday breakfast service is speedy (I've been here with a party of approximately 20 and we were still served in a timely manner!) and the staff efficient. They also offer soya for coffee and tea, so that's a bonus for me. Evenings the service can feel a bit... pushy. While we were very looked after, we were also *very* looked after and continuously had to ask for additional time to read menus - because no way were we able to make up our minds about what we wanted for dessert less than 1 minute after receiving the menu! It's also very dark at dinner, to the point where on one occasion I know the party I was with weren't the only ones asking to turn the lights up. Still, the food and atmosphere here saves it for me and it's why I know I'll come back.",

    "text": "+ upscale American comfort food+ looks appetising + friendly service- small portion size- limited booking availableI came here for lunch on a Saturday. My friend wasn't able to book in advance but we turned up anyway, where the waitress took my details and said a text will be sent when a table frees up, in about half an hour. Sure enough, within half an hour we were sat at the table, wedged between two other couples. It's not spacious but there's enough elbow room to enjoy your meal. The food is a mix of American/Southern comfort food and cafe food, including grit and cornbread. I had their fish cake from the main while my friend went for the ham and egg skillet on the recommendation of the waitress. Both looked great when delivered, although the size is small even for London standard. This may be because they serve \"brunch\" until evening time (possibly all day?), so while portion size is ok for a light brunch, I did find myself wanting more food after.",

    "text": "Jackson and Rye certainly holds itself out as being a Central London go-to brunch destination and you can find it mentioned on lots of London websites to that effect. You need to book ahead (though not far ahead).The decor in there is lovely. It's surprisingly spacious with a real American feel. The brunch options are plentiful - there is almost too much to choose from. I spotted some amazing eggs benedict being delivered to other tables and I definitely made a good choice with the beef hash with poached eggs and spinach - perfectly poached eggs are a rarity and although the portion doesn't look huge it more than fills you up for the day.The only disappointment was the 'buttermilk chicken'. The menu doesn't make clear that this is essentially a fried chicken sandwich - not necessary what you want first thing in the morning (we booked for 10am as it was the only time available).They will also add on the not-so-discretionary 12.5% service charge, even for tables of 2 or 4. When did London suddenly collectively decide that service would be 12.5%, not 10%, and that 'discretionary' means it's included on your bill??",

We were around Soho and looking for a place to have dinner when I saw a tweet from J&R about their cocktails so the siren call drew me in. It's really not what I expected and the front bar has a nice old world hotel grandeur feel. We hopped up on two seats at the bar, all the better for ordering drinks! I didn't experience the crush that other people felt and actually thought it was a pretty chilled placed to sit. And the perfect location for spying on what other people had ordered. Oh man, the truffle mac and cheese smells divine! We were being healthy and ordered two salads which were generously portioned with grilled chicken. I had a good experience here, drinks aren't the cheapest but I'd definitely return...For dessert at the very least ;-)",

I was on the Classy Christmas Crawl organised by Andrew M, attended also by Becky H, and agree with much of what they've said, so will keep it to my main feelings about my experience here:Value is truly terrible. \u00a312 for two pieces of fried chicken, sides extra? Ouch.Quality is so-so. The fried chicken doesn't compare to the excellent fare to be had at the Devonshire Arms in Kensington, for example.Overall. Disappointing, and surprisingly so. New entrants into existing food markets normally fight on something - anything - to gain a foothold against their rivals but J&R don't seem to be bothering with that. A glass of bubbles for those checking in on Facebook is nice, sure, but c'mon, it's hardly enough to draw punters away from established rivals. I hope for the sake of everyone working here that the management comes up with something more substantial to tempt in Soho's brunch crowd, because there is no shortage of worthy alternatives nearby.",

Despite the grim mood, I liked the fare on offer, distinctly American in its offerings such as jalapeno corn bread, grits, fried potatoes, etc along with the usual brunch suspects of eggs, pancakes, etc. It's also nice that they have some regular lunch mains (including steaks!) and sandwiches for those who don't fancy the brunch menu.Purely because of the menu, I decided to go back there and this time I specified an upstairs table in my booking request and we got a booth for a group, yay. The experience was much nicer. The pomegranate/orange/pink grapefruit juice was tasty but a bit of a small serving especially with all the ice. Big fan of the eggs served as Gardener's (vegetarian) & Angler's (with smoked salmon) and the corn bread. A friend ordered pancakes and the portion size was huge for the price. All in all, this is a good spot for casual dining. A note on their service, they seem to tend towards slightly trendy/snooty sorely missing the point of cheerful American service, but even so, it's acceptable enough...",

    "text": "My friends and I ended up at Jackson + Rye as we couldn't get booked at Kopapa or Dishoom for brunch and we needed to be near Leicester Square for some Sing-a-long action at the Prince Charles cinema....This was our first time at any of the Jackson + Rye restaurants, they have more near the river in Chiswick & Richmond, my friend was especially excited to see steak & bourbon on the brunch menu! The Soho branch entrance was tucked under some scaffolding and when we entered it seemed busy & buzzing, the bar area immediately in front and the place full of dark wood paneling.We were led downstairs into the dimly lit basement and ordered some of their fabulous drip coffees to wake us up - they certainly worked a treat, especially as alcohol wasn't sold 'til midday - we had arrived at a respectable brunch time of 11am... They don't advertise the licensing limits anywhere!Whilst waiting for our final friend to arrive we started off by ordering some of the snacks - the truffle arancini and jalape\u00f1o corn bread were amazing! The arancini a decadent hit of truffle oil and cheese and the corn bread warm straight out of the oven, served with sour cream to muffle the kick if you got a whole chunk of the chili.Despite the slow service, we were now anticipating the 'mains' (and the prosecco at midday!)So how did they stand up? Well my brunch was the avocado eggs Benedict - with crispy bacon, which was fabulous and made me happy. Lauren had the corn beef hash - again very tasty.Tiva had steak and eggs and a 'side' of banana cream pancakes - and OMG they were stunning. The banana cinnamon cream with maple syrup was sublime on the American style stack - worth ordering! Ellen had another steak (no eggs!) and a side of Mac and cheese - I have never been so happy that my dining companions were willing to share food :)We quickly necked back two bottles of prosecco with the food (not wanting to wait while the bar woke up and got to grips with cocktails! Our coffees took long enough to come!). I would definitely want to come back here when they've gotten the staff trained and ironed out the small issues, there's a whole menu of cocktails to try with brunch! (But only after midday....)",

    "text": "I've had my eyes on this place since the closure of Satsuma (that used to be there). Jackson + Rye it said on the sign, with that cool font they're using and in my head I assumed a rather nice all-day place. Yep, I was right.Nicely decorated . Think something from early 20th century meets Upper West Side and pops up in London's Soho. A beautiful place, dark but also loud and jammed with people. I've gone to it a day before opening, they were somehow open and without a booking we managed to get a table right away (Tuesday, 8 PM in Soho right before Christmas).We were given menus quickly and asked if we wanted some water and some nibbles before the main deal. We nodded.Soon, we received some olives that seemed to have been marinated in a mixture of brine and orange rind along with some 'filtered' water.On to the main deal, we got a salad to share and two main courses. When the food arrived, it hit me. This is run by the same people who own Grillshack. The resemblance was striking. Same sad plates, same shoestring and 'normal' fries. Same simplicity, not in a good way.So the minute steak was OK and the buttermilk fried chicken was delicious. That was some of the best chicken I've ever had. But the coleslaw was soggy and our salad, well, our salad looked like it had been taken out of the late 80s. I don't have a picture but lookwise it was not inviting. Flavourwise, it was OK. It wasn't special for a salad worth a tenner. 4 satisfactory pieces of (cold) bacon were on the sides and a couple broken pecans. Blue cheese sauce was good.Trying to hide our disappointment and drink our mediocre house wine we decided \u00a0that YOLO and we got desserts. So we ordered the apple fritters and the pretzel shake. Apple fritters were delicious, but at \u00a36.95 for 2 pieces rather expensive. \u00a0Pretzel milkshake tasted like milk with little pieces of crushed pretzel (couldnt taste the bourbon or anything sweet).The service was excellent and despite being seated in the corner we got all the attention we required - quite surprising for a brand new spot.I don't really know what to think of this place. The food is nothing special, nothing I'd go and spend that amount of money on. You pay a lot for its location. There's excellent ambiance and apparently their cocktails are their biggest strength. However, for food that tastes just as Grillshack, I'd rather go straight there and spend less than half.",

    "text": "So close Jackson + Rye, so close.I've walked past the front of Jackson + Rye time and time again from inception to opening to post production, well, not quite post production. I'll start with this, it's in a great location and it's very attractive, the space inside is a bit on the tight side, but I get it, space is expensive.Having heard great things about Jackson + Rye for it's brunch / breakfast, I thought, if it's been well reviewed for brunch, I should probably go for dinner. What tipped the scale and made me set foot in this restaurant was the great deal offered on the 'lunch menu', which incidentally, runs until 6.30pm (what kind of lunch is that). Not one to complain, we popped inside and ordered both the lobster macaroni and the flat iron steak with a salad instead of chips (I know, I know, it was the health drive).When I ordered the flat iron steak, I wasn't actually asked how I wanted my steak, which made me uneasy. However, when it arrived on my table. It was perfectly pink in the middle. Fortunately for me, that's how I like my steaks. The steak was very well seasoned and it was a perfect piece of meat on it's own. It was accentuated by a sauteed onion, which was very welcome. A few strands of greens on the side was completely superfluous though. The salad that this came with was...odd. It was basically half an iceberg lettuce covered with a creamy salad sauce. Although it was quite refreshing and the crunchiness went well the the steak and onion, it wasn't what I was expecting as a 'salad', it wasn't even a poor man's Caesar. I left feeling very confused.The lobster macaroni came with succulent pieces of lobster on top (for a mere \u00a39.90). More than I expected, which is always nice. The macaroni cheese was pretty standard - not cheesy enough for strands of cheese to pull at the escaping macaroni, but still filling and creamy. The drinks here were a no no, the mixed fruit juice came out of a V8 carton (I'm guessing here) and was overtly sweet. The 'homemade lemonade' tasted like lemon juice squeezed into sparkling water. Maybe should've gone for something alcoholic...but then again, before 6.30pm?I will probably be back for the steak alone.",

    "text": "To kick off the Classy Christmas Crawl organised by Andrew M, we had brunch at Jackson and Rye at 1pm. While a few people were late, most of us were seated and ready to order by 1:20. \u00a0Our server asked us if we wanted anything to drink, and there was a promo where you will get a free glass of champagne upon a FB check-in. \u00a0We told him all 10 of us were in the process of checking in, but it took ages for the drinks to arrive. \u00a0Granted it was free - but by 1:45, we were still getting our champagne poured, and itching to order as we had to be out of the resto by 2:30. \u00a0I do like that their turnaround time in the kitchen was pretty quick once the food was ordered, as we received the bill by that time. I was excited to try Jackson and Rye, as their menu looked awesome, but I was a bit disappointed in quality of the meal. \u00a0I had the truffle mac 'n cheese to start, which was \u00a37 - I think thats the most expensive and smallest mac n cheese I've ever had. It was definitely a side size rather than appy size. \u00a0While it tasted truffly, I was really put off by the watery cheese consistency. \u00a0Everyone has who shared a bite thought the same thing. \u00a0My buttermilk fried chicken was \u00a312, and I thought it was bland and not so great. \u00a0It was 2 fillets of chicken with a side of slaw (which I didn't care for) and a wedge of lemon. \u00a0It was crispy on the top, but on the bottom, there was a big section of mushy batter,which was off-putting. \u00a0(On a side note, if you'd like some amazing fried chicken, visit Devonshire Arms in S Ken)I was disappointed in the \u00a312 value of the chicken. I know its the Soho area, but it was a really skimpy portion of food. \u00a0I think this was highlighted when others ordered the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich - and their chicken was MASSIVE, along with a topping of coleslaw and bun for \u00a37. \u00a0My 2 pieces of chicken combined probably made up 1.5x the size of the chicken burger batty. \u00a0So the rest of us who ordered the chicken felt a bit gypped that it cost an extra \u00a35 to essentially skip the bun and get another 1/2 order of chicken fillet. \u00a0While the kitchen turnaround time for food was fast, our server was a bit on the slow side to start off. \u00a0The overall food experience was just kinda meh to me and poor value for the quality. \u00a0Nothing that fantastic here.",

Ordered the pulled pork cups, crab cakes, fried chicken and mac and cheese and it was all above average and very tasty! Ordered the burger and the fries that came with it were extremely undercooked. Had to send the fries back and they gave us new fries which were OK but still not very crispy. Service: Service wasn't great all night. They forgot about our table for the majority of the night. Took 40 minutes simply to place our order, another 30 minutes minutes to bring out drinks etc - very slow and rude service. The food came and we still hadn't even been given cutlery!

The Full American breakfast was delicious, and my friend's pancakes were also great. Good value as well, for a restaurant in Soho prices were exceptionally reasonable. Cocktails were also okay, if nothing special.I'd probably head back there again to check out the fried chicken and the desserts as they looked exceptional.

I washed down the disappointment with a delicious Barrel Manhattan (\u00a38).Paul had the Lobster Mac & Cheese with crispy parmesan topping, which was a blue plate special at \u00a39.95 and was well cooked, full of delicious flavours and contained a generous amount of lobster.Either we were particularly hungry this lunch time or the portions were a bit small but either way, we both had desserts - Paul had the Melting Chocolate Sundae with butterscotch sauce and popping candy for \u00a36.50, which was as tasty as it sounds and I had a nice Baked Potted Cheesecake with berry comp\u00f4te at \u00a35.95 - again, a bit on the steep side for what you get.",

Looking at the (very comprehensive) menu beforehand, I thought Jackson & Rye might be the exact American Breakfast fix I was looking for.First off, the tables are jammed in. The space between ours and the one next to it was minuscule - always makes for a nice awkward private-public conversation. Not a place for relaying any big news or exciting gossip.When it came to ordering, we grappled with a waiter who spoke so quietly and so fast that I still, even after asking him to repeat what he was saying several times, have no idea what he was trying to tell us.The food was good, and arrived swiftly, and the bill was pleasantly low for the middle of Soho.Unfortunately, and I can't really put my finger on why, I don't have any desire to go back. By the time breakfast was over, I wanted to get out of there before they'd even cleared the plates. Please do let me know if I'm entirely wrong, but I really wasn't impressed with the whole experience, and so my search for the best American breakfast in London continues.",

They have several locations and this was the only one open on Sunday. They took reservations for breakfast so I made one. When I showed first thing they asked was if we had reservations even though they were not full. We were 10 minutes late and had one more in the party but they still took us. The seating as not comfortable, small table with lots of traffic around us, but I was just glad to be seating. The service was friendly, and the food delivery fast. I did order a personal drip coffee and the girl that delivered it did not know how to use it. It was delivered to my table without the coffee grounds but they fixed that quickly. I ordered the Farmers and it was great. I especially appreciated getting something close to American bacon in London. The baked beans were a nice surprise, and the eggs and toast enjoyable. Others in my party ordered omelettes and enjoyed them. Be aware that a 12.5% gratuity is automatically added to the ticket. Very fair. Overall great experience for breakfast. Don't forget to make reservations. A return visit is in order if time permits on this trip.",

The menu is extensive (another reason it's a faithful suggestion - covers the picky eaters!) and our choices spanned eggy dishes to more lunchtime options. I really enjoyed my Forager breakfast which came with eggs, halloumi, kale, mushrooms, avo, spiced black beans and a slice of granary. All followed by a bite of my friend's caramelised banana pancakes to finish on a sweet note :)A spot for quiet relaxing time this is not, but for a more lively catch-up you can't beat the buzzy central soho location.

    "text": "In a city that's often full of egregiously flawed preconceived notions regarding the local cuisine, Jackson + Rye really does fall short of expectation.  Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?One thing that certainly isn't lacking at Jackson + Rye is the atmosphere - and the service as well. Located conveniently whether you're out for a meal or seeking a bit of reprieve from the drink, you can expect to be seated swiftly and from a server crew with smiles on their faces. While I'll admit my server was exceptionally slow with regard to refilling waters and settling the bill, that doesn't overshadow what was otherwise a very pleasant experience. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?As nothing on the menu really blew me away with respect to the main dishes, my entire party opted to combo two starters into a meal. My truffled mac n cheese and half lobster were a suitable amount of food for what was a combined \u00a319.20 - fair for a full meal. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?It was here that everything went wrong. The truffled mac n cheese? soupy, and lacking any flavor resembling truffles whatsoever. The pasta was overcooked, the crumbled top overdone, and the flavors simply absent from a dish that should otherwise be creamy and flavorful. The half lobster was equally poor, with little meat to speak of in a skeleton that was clearly overcooked as well. No butter dip? Interesting. All in all, this was poor across the board. No Stars Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?London is absolutely stacked on fabulous dining, but Jackson + Rye falls well short of the curve with regard to quality of food. No Star Granted.",

    "text": "We ate in here on a recent trip to London. We managed to get a same day booking, which I hear in a central London location, is no mean feat! It was busy, but I loved the atmosphere. The decor was beautiful - kind of like a 1940s Manhattan feel. The music was great too. The thing that made this review miss 5 stars was the service. I guess it's just London service. We were served by a Scottish guy, but he conned us out of \u00a32.75 in the first thirty seconds by asking if we wanted \"still or sparkling\" water. Rookie error - still isn't tap water. So if you want water for the table, ask for tap water! We did have an in depth discussion about a Scot conning fellow Scots though...On to the food. Wow! We both love American barbeque and Southern Food. We got the J&R BBQ board to share which consisted of Buffalo Wings, Ribs, Beef Brisket and chips. It was more than enough for the two of us. We also got popcorn chicken and truffle and polenta hush puppies to share too. The food was smoky and delicious and tasted quite genuine too. Again, for a central London location, the price was reasonable at just under \u00a350 for the dinner. A must visit if you're in Soho!",

    "text": "Visited Jackson + Rye for a late Sunday brunch with two girlfriends. When we arrived they couldn't find our booking, but to be fair we had left a message to change it last minute, and they were helpful with finding us a table.The decor within Jackson + Rye is dark and a little claustrophobic, but there's a definite buzz and a young crowd. Sadly this did seem to translate into a slight arrogance / snobbiness within at least one of the staff, who wasn't particularly helpful when I requested to swap an item from my dish. It also took 15-20 minutes from arrival for us to get a drink, which seems excessive even when it's reasonably busy.That said, the food is good - I had the vegetarian breakfast and enjoyed the mix of potatoes, halloumi, eggs, beans, spinach, tomatoes, kale and toast. The prices are also reasonable - less than \u00a39 for the breakfast itself (fairly standard for London and less than you might expect for Wardour Street). Overall I do feel that the restaurant has a slight vibe of being too cool for school, which might be off putting for some, and I personally would enjoy the venue much more if it took on a friendly, welcoming atmosphere.",

The staff was very attentive and checked on our table regularly. Wish the buttermilk pancakes was a main size instead of appetizer. It was delic. True American style- slight crispiness on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Also ordered the yogurt & granola. Yogurt was very liquid/soup-like. Would be better if they had a thicker yogurt. Ordered the fresh orange juice. Unpleasant surprise, there was (lots of) ice in the cup. In my opinion, a way restaurants skimp out on fresh squeezed juice by filling the cup with ice. Overall, food was good, staff very friendly. The menu looks interesting and good so looking forward to checking it out in the future.Also, great ambiance. Cozy, feel good, and not obnoxiously loud.",
