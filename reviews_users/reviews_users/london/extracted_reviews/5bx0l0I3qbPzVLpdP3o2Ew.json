Booking is recommended here as the restaurant is very popular. Seating is a bit crowded but atmosphere is lively and worth the small discomfort. Bread (a soft, highly leavened, rustic type) was served with garlic mayo which was unusual and tasty. The tapas dishes were very tasty and varied. Good selection of vegetarian options (over a dozen) and they were very, very flavoursome and tasty!! Recommended. We particularly enjoyed the aubergines and chick peas dish. Really, really good.",

But, the manager here makes it very clear he could care less about your business. No tables, no split menus items, sit at the bar of find somewhere else to dine. Poor, considering personal experience other major business locations around the globe.Food is ok, but the manager should recognize that many business people travel through this area - \u00a0many of whom know when they clearly are seen as turn-over in advance of the next larger party.I'll think of other spots the next time I am here in the next month with my wife and family.",

Pulpo a la gallega top notch, loved the mini eels, nice garlicky prawns, tasty chicken al ajillo. Wine list good value, I find, with some decent choices in the 20-25\u00a3 range. Only miss out to a complete 5* were the potatoes, which were dry and tasteless. Stick to the meats, seafood, and vegetables. Excellent choice, and we left at \u00a330 per head, including coffees and a shared dessert. Nice detail: a list of recommended years for Spanish red wines on the back of the business card.

Ok, not a great price but a good solid Rioja. \u00a0Then had the peppers and Jamon Serrano for appetizers. \u00a0Tough to screw up so it was good. \u00a0Then came the main order.. steak. \u00a0I ordered rare and to emphasize it I even said \"rojo\" or red in spanish to make sure the Brazilian waiter got the order right. \u00a0Even the guy sitting next to me at the bar heard me say \"walk the cow by and I'll take a bite out of it\" to emphasize that I meant RARE. \u00a0 The steak came out 30 minutes later well done. Oy! \u00a0Then to make up for it the manager said he'd buy dessert and Muscatel. \u00a0 On the bill was the Muscatel.... \u00a0I know enough Spanish to know he told our waiter to give us both.. but somehow the manager rescinded the free Muscatel by the end of the evening as I asked him about it AFTER paying. \u00a0\"Oh I just told him to give you the free dessert\" FYI, I didn't order the Muscatel.... and wouldn't have. \u00a0So...

The tapas bar located in Mayfair is a less than 5 minute walk near the Hard Rock Cafe.While the food is not extraordinary, there is a rather appealing energy that makes up for it. A lot of the food was fried and generously drenched in oil. The squid and the prawns were both fresh but were floating in oil. The baby eels were delicious but again, too much oil.The service is well above average however, with friendly and patient waiters offering adequate help to supplement your thoughts on the menu. Our waitress even rightly told us that we might be over-ordering which we found out to our shock that we much more than over ordered. I would probably come back to try out some of the vegetarian tapas just to make sure I didn't miss something, but definitely not something that would come to my mind when recommending a tapas bar.",

    "text": "It was Friday, 930pm, and we were in Mayfair looking for a place to have a last minute birthday meal (large group of 3). We stumbled across a very busy El Pirata and thought we would give it a try. \u00a0The waiter told us it would be at least a 45 mins wait for a table, but we could sit and eat at the bar straight away (which is what you would do in Spain so it didn't bother us).The service staff were friendly and prompt enough considering it was a full house. I was quite surprised at the reasonable prices considering the location. We ordered some cocktails and set menu 2, once the food started to arrive we switched to Sangria. The sangria was fine, nothing special, but definitely drinkable.Food: \u00a0The food was very tasty. The tapas frias (cold) was fine, nice selection of cured meats, seafood and salad. The monk fish medallions, prawns and calamares, all tasted fresh, not over cooked, nor swimming in oil. \u00a0I particularly enjoyed the peppers stuffed with hake mousse.The steak medallions and lamb cutlets were tasty and cooked well, the potato omelet was fine, by this stage I was filling up. I didn't care much for the chicken wings, but that just personal taste.The atmosphere in the restaurant was buzzing, we got talking to the groups sitting both sides of us at the bar. I noticed one of them eating something that looked amazing. They said it was baby eels, I had to give it a try. \u00a01 x \u00a0\"Gulas con patatas asadas\" \u00a0please (baby eels in olive oil, garlic, dried hot chili peppers & roasted potatoes). This was my favourite dish of the evening, very tasty (if you like garlic), my wife couldn't bring herself to try them as some appeared to be still swimming in the oil (fresh??).The meal came to about \u00a340 per person, which included a lot of food, cocktails and multiple jugs of sangria, not bad in my opinion. I would quite happily recommend giving El Pirata a try if you are in the area. Food was good and reasonably priced, and the service was friendly.",

Actually I went to Madrid right after London, so within reason I can positively state that this tapas place would hold it's own against most tapas bars in Madrid.The only bit that was a bit annoying was just how long it took to get a table. We sat at the bar for an hour before being approached by a very hurried fellow, who then gave us a table sort of squished between the kitchen traffic and the bar traffic. Absolutely no elbow space to speak off.There were the four of us, so we got a load of different things. No meat on this occasion, and we still had more than enough options. So for vegetarians and epicureans, I'd say this is a good bet. They have a decent selection of wines, and some are quite reasonable as well.",

The service was great, and I left most of the tapas decision making up to the bartender. Of the tapas I do recall, the more notable and tasty ones were the montaditos de jam\u00f3n serrano (toasted bread with olive oil and fresh tomatoes topped with cured ham) and the langostinos al chef (grilled king prawns in a sauce of tomato, garlic & white wine).The atmosphere was lively, especially for a Wednesday.

El Pirata is a nice little gem in Mayfair which is a bit unusual because generally you can only find insanely upscale restaurants in this area. It's impressive how many tapas options El Pirata has for you, and we were here with a couple so we tried a lot of different things. The one that stood out was langostinos al chef- a delightful dish of grilled king prawns with tomato, garlic and white wine. They were indeed delicious. The place is A-Ok, nothing more for me. The reason being is that the prices are very high for a lot of the food they are presenting, and although they offer a lot of dishes, not all are amazing. We tried 11 different dishes, and the one that I remember and really enjoyed was the langostinos al chef. The others were fine, but wouldn't bring me back.",

I visited on my own when in London and was looking forward to the meal from the moment I walked through the door. The service was excellent, and the waiter helped my build a dinner that matched my appetite. I started with pan con tomate, and this was as good as I've had. I paired this with padron green peppers from Galicia and jam\u00f3n serrano for the perfect start to the meal.For main course, I opted for a trio that felt like they would compliment each other. They absolutely did - the chuletitas de cordero, carrillera and uevos rotos especiales were made for each other! Each was cooked with skill and care. I didn't want the mains to end, as I tucked into each of these. The carrillera was just perfect, as it carried all of the flavours - it makes me smile just writing about it now.To finish I went for the repe de chocolate, which is a pancake filled with chocolate sauce, flaked almonds & served with vanilla ice cream. It tasted as good as it sounds, and I would come back to El Pirata for this alone. I recommend the restaurant for anyone. From the service to the d\u00e9cor and on to the food, it was a delight in every single way. If you ever near Mayfair, then this is worth visiting.",

Speaking of the bread, it's plentiful and kept the 3 kids we were with occupied when they were bored with trying new things. You heard that right, we brought 3 kids here! They did a great job accommodating us, my only complaint being our server disappeared at the end of the meal and we ended up waiting almost 30 minutes just to pay our tab. Kids were getting unmanageable and it was a bit of a sad way to end an otherwise pleasant meal. The sampling menu was enough to feed 2 adults with a small appetite. One each would be good if you're more hungry. Try to sit downstairs if you can, the alcoves are unique!",

The Pulpo was mediocre, In fact, I was discouraged with the wooden plate they used to plate the dish, because it soaked most of the flavorings and olive oil, and the octopus was more rubbery in texture than it should have been . The place was also too compactly seated. I was literally in elbow to elbow with the next Guest behind me who was overly gesturing with his friend while conversing. There isn't that much option in this particular block, and learning from this, I will organize my time better to plan for Piccadilly Circus area instead, or better yet just head down to Hard Rock Cafe which is a block away---definitely not a place i would go back to again. I also noticed, that most of the Guests who were of Asian Heritage like I am were seated in the underground level... \u00a0maybe a coincidence tonight(??)... ---Just stating my observation. When we finished our dinner, on our way out, there were no Asians in the upper level. It was an odd atmosphere.",

Some bread and garlic aioli was served as well.With the misty afternoon, my experience at el Pirata was a comforting meal in so many ways -- the flavor, the wine, and discussion about Spain with the staff.I'm not entirely up on the Spanish dining scene in London, but having lived in Spain for a year, I can very much tell you that this place is the real deal and serves up some fantastic flavors that, if you closed your eyes, would have you thinking you're on the Iberian peninsula.",

    "text": "El Pirata has been sitting on my restaurant list for a while, so when I was thinking of a place to grab dinner with a friend who works in Victoria, it was a pretty obvious choice. They don't have a booking system on their website, nor do they use Opentable or Bookatable, which leaves you the options of either booking by phone or by email. At first I called and found it relatively easy to make a reservation, but then I didn't get a confirmation so I also emailed to follow up. When my friend was running late and we had to move the reservation back by half an hour with just a few hours' notice, they were also very accommodating. All in all, quite painless to get a table. When I arrived, I was seated immediately in the downstairs part of the restaurant.The other thing I loved about this place is that they have set menus! We really just wanted to catch up and talk, and it was great to not have to spend time agonizing over the options and instead go with one of the two set menus. They are also incredible value, for either \u00a318 or \u00a322 / person. \u00a0We went with the \u00a322 option, and we got three courses of tapas - first bread / aioli and a round of cold tapas, like parma ham and some stuffed peppers. We then had fried fish and calamari, prawns, and some chicken wings. Finally we had large servings of lamb, steak, and Spanish omelette. \u00a0All the food was fantastic, but my favourites were the lamp chops, the calamari, and the prawns. Everything was delicious and we were both incredibly full at the end.As for the drawbacks, service was not fantastic as I had to ask a number of times for water and for the bill before I managed to get either. The table for 2 is a bit small to fit 3 plates of tapas at a time. But overall, I thought El Pirata was great value and I would definitely recommend it for excellent tapas without a wait!

Service is a bit ad hoc - not all that bad but more attention can be paid so diners would not have to attempt to pour their water or wine by themselves. Just a thought/observation. We were perfectly equipped to serve ourselves and I liked all of the waiters. The tapas was fresh and well-executed. The tortilla was moist and light. The patatas bravas was also flavorful, even though we were originally dubious about the shade of the sauce. My favorite dish was the baby eels (which we ordered due to a Yelp review recommendation) and E liked the tortilla best. The croquettes jamon iberico were yummy but showed up at our table at the end so we were already quite full. It didn't stop us from ordering the platanos fritos (fried bananas) for desert. See photo. So good.If I'm in the vicinity again, I would definitely go back. Not pretentious at all nor crazy expensive and great tapas. * written in collaboration with E",

On each occasion the dishes are similar to those I enjoyed in Spain \u00a0and I give them an A+. \u00a0The service however I'd give a D- I was basically ignored throughout the meal on each occasion and received terribly slow service. So yesterday, unfortunately, was the last time I will return to this hot spot in London. Looks like Bilbao Berria next to the Sofitel might be a new London hotspot to try next.",

I don't think it's someone though the place is packed and I've noticed that a few people here are regulars. I'd recommend the toasted bread with tomatoes to start. Enjoy it",
