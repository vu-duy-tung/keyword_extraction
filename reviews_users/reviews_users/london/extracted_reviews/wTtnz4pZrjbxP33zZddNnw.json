    "text": "An idea as great as simple. Hummus and a topic you can choose (cold or hot) with freshly baked pita. In London there are countless places to go when you are hungry, but Hummus bros. is something extraordinary. Probably because they haven't really competition. Until now they are quite unique and the idea is perfect, because hummus is indeed something you can just eat everyday without getting bored (as they make different topics, dependent on the season). I tried chicken and lenses - both were delicious! I also loved the drinks (ginger lemonade with mint or fresh aloe vera with grapes, also a homemade limonade) which were really yummie and well measured. Funnily enough while checking the card and deciding what to drink the waitress suddenly asked: \"Are you German?\" I (uncertain, disappointed in my accent): \"Yes...\" She: \"Also k\u00f6nnen wir uns auch auf deutsch unterhalten.\" She heard us talking german before. Obviously she was a student from Berlin. Cool coincidence. Anyway Hummus Bros are great! Everybody who wants a bit oriental-big-city-flavour should eat here. The prices are ok and the drinks are great. Also perfect for vegetarians! The paper instructions/analysis about the way you eat hummus and therefore your character are hilarious! The Berlin waitress gave us some as a souvenir. Also it was a great distraction while waiting in the airy room for our meals to come.",

    "text": "I've been to this Hummus Bros on two separate occasions. I was pleased with my chicken dish the first time and decided to come back for more. The curry lamb special caught my eye, so I thought I should give it a shot.The dish was pretty underwhelming. I'm a big fan of lamb, and the flavour just didn't come through all the way for me in this dish. Beyond that, the curry wasn't very spicy, which only leaves a strangely bland taste.That said, the regular portion is substantial -- certainly enough for a meal on its own considering the pittas served with it. I wouldn't recommend buying the baklava -- although it's tasty, I think the portion is too small to justify the price.",

    "text": "You are provided with a dish of houmous and lots of pittas. What you get to decide is the topping that comes with it. My personal favourite is the beef. I never really thought it would compliment the houmous, but It was darn tasty. The pittas are delicious! Wholemeal and fluffy, I think they make a great addition to the meal. Don't be fooled into thinking that you need to order lots of food because the dishes arn't too big. The food is really really REALLY filling. The side dishes are worth trying too. The aubergine is an aquired taste. My friends didn't like it, but I loved it. A real smokey taste. The only problem I had is the seating. Everyone is arranged on benches, which normally i wouldn't have a problem with, but we were sitting RIGHT next to some very loud people, who were slightly inconsiderate to everyone around them. I think we were just unlucky this time. Not too expensive either. 5 stars!",

The food was great and the hummus was lovely aswell. However, I must say that, when I eat oriental food, i like to have the entire oriental experience to go along with it. I like the decorations to be very oriental and the music aswell. Hummus Bros was a good place, however it did not really reach my oriental standards. Pro's: OK food, nice decoration, modern, clean and simple Con's: No oriental feeling",

    "text": "I really want to give Hummus Bros more stars because I love the whole idea behind the cafe, the staff are so, so nice and the restaurants are attractive, but I'm afraid the hummus just isn't that nice. The brainchild of two University buddies (who aren't actually brothers) Hummus Bros first opened in Soho and this is the second branch to appear. They are a very environmentally friendly business; recycling, using renewable energy for their electricity and even the menus are printed on recycled card, so I'm really pleased about all that, but the hummus just doesn't cut it.You can choose from a small bowl (around \u00a34.50) or a large (around \u00a35.50) with crudit\u00e9s, salads, or more substantial combinations all served with a nice fluffy, warm, wholemeal pitta bread. I tried the special of the day which was spicy meatballs. They pipe a huge, thick roll of hummus around the outside of your bowl and the rest of the food goes in the middle. I really found this to be too much, even though I love hummus it was more than you'd get in an entire shop bought pot and you wouldn't eat all that in one sitting would you! The thing I didn't like was that it's so smooth, for me it barely resembled real eastern hummus which is meant to be textured. The strangest thing though is that they don't add lemon or garlic, you get it in a little separate pot on the side, but pouring this on the top of your hummus makes it taste even stranger as this has to be mixed well during preparation to offer a subtle flavour. I guess one good point is that you wont stink of garlic for the rest of the day! Unfortunately this all means it tastes mainly of tahini, and is the same consistency, so after a while we both just began to feel queazy and left half of our small dishes. This restaurant has real potential, but they just have one major problem... their main ingredient. If you're a true fan of proper hummus I just can't imagine that you'd like the stuff they make here, it's rather like eating squirty cream out of a can instead of jersey clotted cream. It's such a shame because Hummus Bros is a nice place, but for now I'll stick to cafes like Maoz who although don't specailse in hummus have a much tastier recipe.",

Almost the best part is the friendly welcome and service you receive (and the buttons they give you saying \"give peas a chance!\"). The last time I went, my friend ordered dinner while I just had lemonade as I had already eaten earlier. By mistake, they made two portions of my friend's order and offered the second to me at no price.

A great place to get a fast lunch or dinner if you are gluten-free, also, as most of the food is GF and they will substitute the pita for GF bread (dry but good for mopping up hummus), tortilla chips (weird with hummus but fabulous with the garlic/cilantro/tomato topping on the falafel), or carrot sticks. The grilled aubergine is smokey and garlicky - also really great with tortilla chips. Almost everything is vegetarian except for maybe 2 meat options. Definitely try the aloe juice - I'm now completely addicted and don't know what I will do when I go back home. :( \u00a0the mint-ginger lemonade is also incredibly refreshing.Two other great bonuses: free wifi!!! and student happy-hour discount where you get half-price drinks (non-alcoholic but a great deal) and half-price side dishes with your ID.

I think the feeble attempt at what I assume to be Mexican fusion was really strange, and I hate pickles. And we're not talking assorted pickled vegetables, but actual pickles like you would put on a ham sandwich or something. My friend got the spicy wrap and it tasted like jalapeno, and you can add guacamole. I'm sure people like it, but I didn't expect it or want it.Anyway - besides that the food was good. Hummus is thicker than usual, more like a heavy paste. Quite good. Falafel was chunkier than usual but the texture and flavor are good. Yeah, it feels a bit expensive for a vegetarian meal but I've paid more for worse falafel in London...I'll go back. Supposedly there is a student discount as well.",

The falafels were good but the 'falafel salad' was a bit of a rip off! they gave me two bits of pita bread which were free but I didn't ask for them and would have preferred more salad than them because the salad was tiny and I didn't want bread! very friendly staff on a positive! but very average hummus!!",

    "text": "I love, love, love Hummus Bros. I just need to put that out there. London is known for having bland, greasy, and overall lackluster cuisine. However, Hummus Bros. is the complete opposite of everything that food in London has been known for. The food at Hummus Bros is always fresh and full of flavor, and fairly priced! They serve each hummus dish with a side of lemon and garlic sauce, and the hummus itself is flavored just right. The meats are tasty and the garnishes are all mouth watering. It seriously makes it hard to eat hummus anywhere else. My favorite dish is the half-gaucamole, half chicken plate. Who knew that guacamole and hummus could go together so perfectly?!Every time I'm in London I make it a point to bring a new friend to Hummus Bros in hopes that they'll be just as hooked and continue the trend. It's a great place for anyone that enjoys a good, hearty meal. There are student discounts and there is also free wi-fi as well (which is actually quite hard to come by in Europe outside of McDonalds/Burger King).The only thing that is missing at Hummus Bros is alcohol!Give (chick)peas a chance!",

Although I won't say I was disappointed --there are a lot of options, even as a vegetarian, that I'd be willing to try on future visits -- I wasn't thrilled with their hummus recipe. The texture looked and felt almost whipped, and the colour strikingly grey, which I suspect is due to a larger ratio of tahini. The taste seemed to verify that - it had an exceptionally smoky flavour which at first bite was quite nice, but became almost sickeningly rich after subsequent mouthfuls. \u00a0Although I'm not a spice addict, I found myself dumping the entire bowl of cilantro/coriander chili sauce \u00a0onto my hummus plate to try to balance out the flavour. (I will say that the sauce was very tasty on its own). I do also agree with other reviewers that it's a very large amount of hummus, (topped with a basin of olive oil) even as a small portion, which makes me wonder at what point it ceases to become a \"healthy\" option...The mint/ginger lemonade was quite good (and the student discount even better). I imagine I'll go back sometime to try some of the sides and drinks but I can find hummus more to my liking elsewhere in the city. Otherwise, the menu is innovative, the prices are good, and the staff seems friendly so overall I'd recommend it, but if you are used to more of a chick-pea flavour in your hummus you might be a little disappointed. Menu items ordered: Small lunch reduced-fat hummus with vegetable salad topping. Mint and ginger lemonade",

The hummus salad was mild and creamy with rich sesame flavour. Then crunchy aromatic falafel and chicken gave a wonderful accent! Tender Tzatziki also helped to make a wonderful completion of the dish! For the second time, I finally ordered \"Hummus bowl with Guacamole and falafel salad which was great as I expected!The restaurant is stylish and modern style on the wooden floor at the clean premises.I felt their passion into the brand (as you can see they put effort into the design of bags too!) and they select the ingredients carefully.",

But then I went to Hummus Bros. The chicken and falafel salad is perfect. They have two sizes depending on how hungry you are or if you want to save some for later. The larger size comes with an extra pita slice and they toast the pita so its warm and soft for you even if its for take away. You can substitute the pita for rice cakes, carrot sticks, gluten-free bread, or corn tortilla chips. They also have a little chart on the front counter that states what items are vegetarian/ egg free/ gluten free/ soy free / peanut free, etc.....The falafels are so so so good and the hummus and toppings it comes with makes for a perfect and satisfying meal. I love having it with jalapenos, which do cost a little extra. I would crave Hummus Bros which would lead me to come here several times and I was satisfied with each visit. Oh and they have free wi-fi as a bonus",

WIN!clean, modern and industrial is how i'd describe it. Although mainly aimed at lunch time take out ( i think), it does have some seating. Menu is clear concise and not overly complicated or too many options. With this said i must have still looked a little baffled (probably because i wanted to eat it all) as the lovely lady on the till taking orders quickly jumped into action to help me through it. Excellent service. And continued as i had everything bagged and ready to go within 2 mins. FYI i ordred chicken & Guacamole hummus bowl, with pitta and a drink and a side of tabbouleh salad. \u00a38. not bad for london, when i can get a sandwich and drink i dont like for \u00a36+I'm now sat at my desk eating it and aside from the taboulleh perhaps requiring a little more lemon juice (which i expect is a personal preference) its a winner!!

    "text": "Had dinner here recently, but overall came away with mixed feelings. First, the place has a nice setup, with \u00a0a small ground floor quick service area set up with picnic style tables and a large upper floor. It was fairly busy when we went, with two large tour groups occupying the upstairs in succession. A server quickly took our order at the table, and the food came out within a few minutes, which was great.The portions are decent sized, especially as pita and hummus are quite filling. We got a large bowl and a wrap, and this was more than enough for two people to share. The hummus was delicious and the two warm brown fluffy pita was perfect to tear and dip. The wrap was pretty big, but stayed together nicely. Onto the negative: first, they got our bowl order wrong. We ordered chicken and guacamole, but were served chicken and falafel. We were hungry though and didn't want to wait for a new one so we didn't bring this up with staff. Second, the falafel had a delicious crunchy exterior but they were almost cold, which wasn't too appealing. Third, they added almost \u00a37 to the bill, with an item apparently coming from a table that had already left. When we brought that up after paying they apologized and gave us \u00a33 back, mystifyingly; we had to prompt again for the correct change. Fourth, the bathroom was pretty messy, with shreds of paper on the ground and the ol' watered down hand soap trick, which made it difficult to feel like you could wash your hands well - kind of important with this kind of cuisine. Fifth, to top it off, when we asked if there was a student discount, staff just said, \"No.\" That was a bit disappointing considered how it's all over the yelp page, but also left us puzzled and no further information was given. So all in all, despite the genuinely delicious food, probably won't be heading back here. Too many little bothers came up and took away from the overall experience. That said, it seems very popular for large groups, probably for the location, space, fast and good eats, and decent price.",

But the UK has dining places that specialise in freshly made hummus. As the hummus tub has been a party lifesaver for any American event, stuffing ones mouth with pre-made hummus is not the same experience as stuffing one's mouth with freshly blended and whipped chickpeas. It makes me sad that a place that specializes in homemade hummus only exists in the United Kingdom.The hummus is whipped into a cream-like texture. The hummus cream tastes slightly tangy, and nutty but well-blended with oil, chick peas and possibly garlic; and served with the freshest most fluffy pita bread imaginable. The hummus has such a fine flavor that has the quality of it being blended with egg yolk (though it is actually vegan.)My favourite part about this place is that table service is not compulsory. The hummus with pita could be eaten in any part of the two-story building but there is no waiter service on the ground level. Upstairs offers table service, with couches and a food elevator. It is a lot more quiet and business meeting-like up there. Three Tips:Tip 1:While the picnic table/communal table style seating fills up on the ground level very fast, takeaway is also an option and cheaper. Tip 2:Dinner prices are more expensive than lunch prices. Perhaps the more expensive the quieter? Takeaway for dinner, for example, is same price as eating in for lunch.Tip 3:Although this place is small and seating is limited, find another dining place in the area that offers free wifi!Tip 3 A:Credit cards are accepted.",

    "text": "I LOVEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE Hummas Bros. LoveLoveLove. I won't leave London without some. I get hummas with 'shrooms on top. There's a low fat hummas (minus the Tahini), but it gets gone quick!I was there twice last week. The first time, I was quietly reading and minding my business. A few annoying students decided to practically sit on top of my TUSH (I wanna say something else). Why not sit at the other bench or the stools??? They gave lame, meek apologies and proceeded with their loud and inane banter. Eventually I got up and moved my seat. I think the server felt badly because he came over and offered me a lovely mint tea on the house. Oh it was yummy. I had another.Love this place and if someone wants to go in with me, I'd open one in NY, DC and Miami!",

    "text": "I think if you combined the different franchises of this single restaurant concept around London, you might actually find it to be one of the higher rating businesses, and certainly one of the strongest performers among 'chain-ish' restaurants. Certainly since my first visit, I've been back several times, and have converted several people by convincing them to 'Give Peas a Chance'... and they've all loved it.Hummus Bros does... hummus, unsurprisingly, but they do it very well. Warm pitas, fresh toppings, mmmmm. Also, a falafal salad I die for. And, a mint and ginger tea that never fails to refresh.This is a little slice of the Mediterranean that shouldn't be missed, among locals and visitors alike. Situated so well between Holborn and Russell Square stations, there's not excuse not to stop in.",

Honestly, the prepackaged hummus at the nearby Sainsbury's was tastier. I'll give credit though to the texture of the hummus here, which is very smooth and lovely. Perhaps their hummus dishes with the toppings are actually good, but I think I'll look elsewhere when I'm craving hummus.",

Yes, it can be done!I have been here many times, so I can say it's really well made hummus, everything taste really fresh. FOOD: My usual is the regular beef with warm cider, but the veg and chicken options are just as good. I will say that I wish they had more pitas, but I rarely ever finish mine, so I take it home for a late night snack, hence the regular over small. SERVICE: They guys here are really great too, and for first timers, patient and helpful. LOCATION: They have an upstairs location and for being so close to a busy intersection, it's a relatively quiet place to work, especially after the lunch rush. I highly recommend it as a place to break up the lunch monotony and keep with a healthy diet.",

However it's slightly pricey for what you get -- I got the small portion and was disappointed this has one small piece of falafel and was mostly hummus. I only had one pita to eat all the hummus which wasn't enough. Still, it filled me up and tasted delicious. As Alex said, not a lot of places to sit here but great for takeaway. Service was really quick and I took my lunch over to Russell Square for a picnic.",
