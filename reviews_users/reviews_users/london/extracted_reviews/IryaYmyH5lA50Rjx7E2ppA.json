Meals are super-cheap and come with plentiful salads and yoghurt. The chilli with rice and Moroccan meatballs with yoghurt are an especially tasty treat. There's also a nice selection of deserts and chocolate for afters. As it's fast food, it's also super-quick, so is ideal if you're heading off to the theatre and are in need of speed. It's also nice to see a healthy restaurant which features some meat and isn't entirely veggie based. The only thing about this one is why they insist on giving you table service when you're eating in \u00a0at the other Leons you just take it from the counter and it's even quicker.",

Pining for NY's Coldstone Creamery, I traipsed round a few streets and racked my brains for somewhere sweet and swish, to no avail. I love Leon for its Power Smoothies and Superfood salads in the daytime, but I thought it might be worth a shot at 9pm \u00a0and glimpsing the menu, my trio, desparately seeking pudding, thought we had hit upon a gem. The evening menu looks simply sumptuous and so we ordered three pecan pies. Hurrah! Sticky nutty delight \u00a0or so we thought. Nope, all gone. Home-made lemonade? Sold out. Hot chocolate? No such luck. We begrudgingly settled on coffees and chocolate milkshakes, and these were served and enjoyed \u00a0great quality, very tasty, if a little pricey [almost \u00a35 for a shake]. We came to pay so we could make a hasty sashay off to Charing Cross and our trains \u00a0but this proved to be the most trying process of all. The young lady who served us was slow, rather rude and incapable of simple arithmetic. She was reluctant to let us pay the bill in two parts, refused cash, left us halfway through the transaction and had to ask repeatedly the sum we wished to pay! This little episode won't put me off Leon for good \u00a0but it might make me think twice about visiting in the evening. Three stars because the decor is divine and the food fabulous, but the service was nothing short of very poor on this occasion.",

There were also nuts sprinkled on top, as well as brown rice and coleslaw with cabbage, carrots, and peas (thankfully I could not detect any mayonnaise).

As a result, I ended up waiting roughly 20 minutes for my Moroccan Meatball Box. \u00a0However, I was very promptly compensated with a free appetizer, which was nice. \u00a0Besides that, service appeared prompt, and it's nice to see that you can watch the chefs make your meal. Star Granted.Star 2 - How were the portions relative to the cost?Compared to your run of the mill fast food joint, Leon is expensive (10 GBP+ for a medium portioned meal), however, as is often the case, you get what you pay for. \u00a0I often describe Leon to friends as what a Whole Foods Markets take-away joint would look like. \u00a0The portions are a bit small, but the quality of the food brings in the star.Stars 3/4 - Did the food taste good?I was thoroughly impressed with the taste of my Moroccan Meatball box, and it was nice to see that the menu appears to rotate frequently, however, while the meatballs were great, the box was filled with what appeared to be pretty common fillers. \u00a0Disregarding the pulses and basic beans, I pretty much paid 10 pounds for some quality meatballs. \u00a0One star granted.Star 5 - Would you eat it every day if you could?I'm a huge fan of the growing healthy fast-food movement, and it's places like Leon that are really pioneering the shift in consumer perspectives. \u00a0While many of the menu items have some fillers and prices are high, I really could eat at Leon every day and be happy. Star Granted.",

I had the Moroccan Curry with brown rice and slaw and it was surprisingly nice! (Can you tell I'm weary on chain restaurants?) I also had a couple of waffle chips which were really good too.I'm glad to know I can safely go to Leon for a bite to eat and able to go along with friends without being a drag or just eating hummus.*Also menu symbols for vegetarian, wheat free, gluten free, low GI, low sat. fat and nuts. If you want nutritional information or other allergy ingredients, they are ALL listed on the website for each dish. Kudos to you Leon!",

It's clear even though it describes itself as fast food it's food is fresh and freshly prepared. The thing I love about Leon is all it's little touches. While the food is uncomplicated but really yummy, the layout of the restaurant and all it's little touches are just adorable. I sometimes feel that you're really paying for the branded cups and napkins rather than the food, but it's so bright and colorful it's hard to complain. It's also great for us Veggies. It goes beyond a mushroom in a bun and offers good old Hallomi burgers with lovely touches such as a well toasted bun and amazing burger sauce. These little touches do make a difference. Always a win.",

We ordered the one of the set menus for 23 quid and some wine to go with the meal. I liked the informal nature of the place; the food was good the service was friendly. The Halloumi pots were delicious but the flat bread arrived slightly cold. Other recommendations would definitely be to try the fresh slaw, Chicken & Chorizo Club & the sweet potato fallafal. This is a good place to go, if you fancy a meal that isn't too fussy and formal but also has some kind of substance/atmosphere to it. I would go back again for sure, more of a nice stopping place for food rather than a destination.",

Given that very specific brief, definitely as good as it gets! \u00a0Nothing like it anywhere else that I've lived. \u00a0This contributes to my current Londonlove.",

Having not tried the McDonalds version, I couldn't comment, but the fish was very dry and chewy.In all, I will definately go back to grab a quick bite.

Leon seems to tick every box with a vengeance! The menu is very varied with a meditteranean twist so even fussy eaters and those with dietary issues are likely to find something to suit. The menu is also very appealing with items such as wraps, salads and hot foods available as well as the soup du jour and the odd special here and there. My last visit had a chicken laksa soup and Morrocan meatballs meal as the orders and spectacularly good they were too. The meatballs were beautifully cooked in a delicious sauce and a generous helping piled on top of brown rice with a fantastic coleslaw side. In its cardboard tray it didn't seem much but eating it soon proved that it was more substantial than it looked.The chicken laksa soup was an experiment as my partner loves hot (as in spicy) soup and was concerned that the laksa would likely be tamed down for Brit tastes. To her delight it wasn't. Rich, spicy, creamy ... everything a laksa should be and very tasty too.Barely room for dessert but the mini-knickerbocker glory with natural yoghurt, fresh fruit and compote went down a treat and I don't think my partner could have been separated from her chocolate tart.The Strand venue is spacious and the music non-intrusive, the decor bright and retro while still feeling warm and inviting. The staff were very helpful as well and it would have been a five star review had they not run out of the desserts we REALLY wanted",

I'd probably skip that in future in favor of the meatballs and curried dishes, as I think Leon do such a good job with those. \u00a0Their hummus is rather nice, and the crushed pea salad with its lovely minty flavor makes eating your veggies more enjoyable. \u00a0Wish the fries were a bit crispier and hotter, but they're probably baked, not fried.You get a good portion of healthy food for your money, and it's ready nice and quick! \u00a0Some things are better than others, but that's the same everywhere!",

Or how, when you walk past a Subway, you get a whiff of that unmistakable Subway smell? None of this happens at Leon. Nothing tastes the same; it's constantly evolving, changing, different. The ingredients are fresh and it tastes like healthy, clean eating (though there are naughty options too, when you feel up to it!).Leon tastes intelligent. And maybe it's the prosecco I've had tonight, but the menu isn't contrived and a lot of thought has been put into the flavors and the product. Their lemonade is the closest to the beloved lemonade of my home country, the US. Plus, as a on-off lactose intolerant individual, I'm a big fan of their non-milk milkshakes.A winner all around.",
