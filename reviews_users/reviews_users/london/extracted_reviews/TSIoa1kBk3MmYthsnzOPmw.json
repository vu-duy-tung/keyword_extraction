    "text": "The wife and I headed up to London for a spot of Christmas shopping and after putting in a busy two hour shift on the streets of London, it was time for some chow down. So where should we go? We opted for something we would both would enjoy, so Bubbledogs seemed to be the obvious choice, bubbles for the lady, and dogs for me.Let me tell you a little bit about Bubbledogs, Bubbledogs is a hot dog & champagne bar on Charlotte Street in the Fiztrovia area , yes you heard me right, a hot dog & champagne bar, it's only been open a few months but has had some really good reviews, anyway, on with my story.We rocked up around 17.30 and there was a cue to get in, and it had only just re-opened, the queue was moving pretty quick but we noticed the restaurant was filling up, FAST. We got to the door and boom! front of house denied us, \"Sorry guys we are full, will be a hour wait\" damn! What should we do? They wouldn't take our mobile number so we could sit in a pub to pass the time, so our animal instincts kicked in, let's drink in the cue to pass the time, so my good lady wife set off for the goods, we seemed to set the trend as a couple of other people thought it was a good idea, we passed the time by chatting and drooling over the hot dogs which were arriving at the tables inside. Before we knew it, half hour passed and a table came up, we were in!We took our seats and mulled over the menu, after gawping at the hot dog menu through the window for half hour we already knew what we were going to order, I went for two as I was ravenous, so I had the 'New Yorker' which was a beef frank with grilled sauerkraut and the 'Sloppey Joe' which was a pork frank with bubbledogs chilli, onions and cheese. The wife ordered a 'BLT' which was a bacon wrapped pork frank with caramelized lettuce and truffle mayo, we both ordered a side of sweet potato fries. Our champagne was our next port of call, after much thought the wife went for a glass of Juillet-Lallement Rose and I went for a glass of Chartogne Taillet, now at this point I was getting excited and we didn't have to wait to long for our food and drinks. The champagne came out first, now I'm no champagne connoisseur but I liked this champagne very much, quite dry, but very nice, the wife seemed to of picked the most expensive one on the menu, but judging by her reaction and the noises she was making it was a goody.The food arrived and I couldn't wait to tuck in, I tried the sweet potato fries first, very crispy, lovely and fluffy inside, one of the best sweet potato fries I have tasted in London, I could of eaten a bucket load. The dog's were very good too, I tried the 'New Yorker' first, took my first bite and I was greeted with the nice soft bun, then the sauerkraut, then the pop of the beef frank, really good, the 'Sloppy Joe was up next, and this was a real messy beast, the chilli was just the right heat and combined with the pork frank and cheese a real taste overload. The wife really enjoyed her dog, especially the truffle mayo. We finished up our drinks and called it a day, as we knew we had people waiting for our table.Overall our experience was a good one, and the wait wasn't that bad in the end, the staff are super friendly and are on the ball, always checking if we are ok, or wanted any more drinks or food. I'd recommend Bubbledogs to anyone with a open mind, yes it seems strange that you would mix champagne with hot dogs, but it works with me, go on, give it a bash.",

The \"dog\" was skinny and the coleslaw that came on top of mine was like a supermarket value range. Coleslaw isn't hard to make? You could at least make it well. The tots were the best bit, but still arrived luke warm.Good for a one time experience, but never again!",

That is the case here.Atmosphere, service, originality and poetic descriptions of champagne made up for indifferent dogs and fun yet ultimately unappealing sides. I loved drinking a mouthful of fruit and flowers, and it was great fun eating dogs at a high table in a children's birthday party for grownups sort of way.Ultimately, I suggest coming with a party of 6 or more, so that you can book ahead and skip the queue, and than drinking gallons of champs and scoffing a few hot dogs. Great fun!",

    "text": "I loved it here! Went with 2 girlfriends last night. It was a rainy Tuesday evening and we got there at 6.30, but still had to queue for about an hour. They don't take reservations if you're under about 6 people I think. It doesn't matter though - it was well worth the wait. We all got the 'BLT' dog, which was wrapped in bacon, carmelized onions and truffle mayo. Yes, TRUFFLE mayonnaise. It was out of this world delicious. They offer hot dogs in beef, pork or veggie. We all got the beef and it was fantastic. We also split 2 sides - sweet potato fries and tots - both excellent. The sweet potato fries in particular were wonderful. We also split 2 bottles of champagne, which was great. The champagne list goes on for pages and pages. We asked the waitress for a recommendation, and she was very helpful and the type we chose in the end was great. The waitress was very attentive, not leaving the bottle on the table but always making sure our drinks were topped up. The vibe in the restaurant itself was great. It was loud - but not too loud. We all agreed it would be a great place for a first date. When we got the bill it came tucked into a little notebook that you could write or draw little notes or cartoons in - very cute touch. In all our bill for 3 hot dogs, 2 sides, and 2 bottles plus 2 glasses of champagne came to about \u00a3184. The food itself was reasonable - it's just that we had so much champagne!! I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Oh Bubbledogs, what a disappointment. This place is the definition of style over substance. The interior is slick and stylish, shiny metallic bar and trendy bar stools with neon signage and the appropriately good looking staff. I have been excited about visiting Bubbledogs ever since it opened, but put off by the tale of long queues we decided to wait a while. What's not to be excited about? Champagne and hot dogs! CHAMPAGNE AND HOTDOGS! Oh the joy.However, it wasn't quite the experience I had hoped for.The 'restaurant' is super tight. There aren't many seats, and the ones they have are so close together that whole groups have to get up and move when you want to get in or out of your seat. Also expect to share your extremely tight space with complete strangers. Very close. The range of champagnes and reasonable prices are great, can't fault that. It's a fine place to pop in after work for a fancy drink with friends. The hotdogs however are rubbish. I was impressed with the choices and the array of toppings on offer, but the dogs themselves were tiny, much like the smallest canned version you can buy from the supermarket. The buns are beyond standard, and far too big for the tiny dogs. And the toppings are minimally portioned and extremely basic. I was so disappointed. I can honestly say the hotdogs I make at home are better. And not \u00a37 each.Treat the hotdogs like a bar snack, pretend they're just expensive peanuts, and nibble a bit whilst you drink your nice champagne in a trendy environment. Then actually go out for dinner. Or go home for dinner. Win.",

    "text": "A friend of mine checked in here on FB, and the name made me curious - so I Googled it. \u00a0Then, a couple of months later, when travelling to the UK and she asked where I wanted to go for dinner - this was my first choice.I wasn't disappointed. \u00a0The queues were long, but our friend made her boyfriend wait in line whilst we navigated the underground (lucky I am not writing a review on those!).So when we finally met up, he was already well into the wait and saved us probably 30-45 minutes. \u00a0As it was, we still waiting about 30 minutes, but it was worth it (not sure my friends boyfriend feels the same way).In the end, we ordered between the four of us, a lot of hot dogs and ample sides. \u00a0I can't remember them all, but none of them disappointed. \u00a0We all enjoyed every hot dog, and the waiter had a very good knowledge of the Champagne. \u00a0I know nothing about it, so I won't expose that ignorance by trying to review it. \u00a0I enjoyed everything I drank, and those at the table who knew more about it than me also loved it.The only thing I wouldn't recommend ordering is the Cheese Whizz. \u00a0If you've ever had the sickly, tacky textured, artificial mess that they serve up in the US - then this is a very good substitute. \u00a0It starts out bad, and as it cools and solidifies, it gets worse.Strongly recommend the sweet-potato fries though, and the potato tots are what they are. \u00a0Coleslaw was delicious also, and a good choice of side to cut through the protein hit you get from the dogs.The crowd was packed in, and you were elbow to elbow with the people you dined with, and most of the ones you weren't - but it all added to the vibe of the place, and made for a great fun evening. \u00a0Staff was attentive, knowledgable, and good humoured. \u00a0There was no coat check, but the tables have a space underneath for your bags, jackets, and other items.All up, a great night and I highly recommend it - especially if you have someone to pre-line up for you :)",

    "text": "One star for the concept, one star for the corn dog and one for the friendly service. Otherwise it was just OK.For one, the bubbly is fairly pricey - we ordered the only bottle below 45gbp (a prosecco) and it was quite bland. \u00a0For the dogs we ordered K-dawg, Buffalo dog and the Horny Dog, one with the beef sausage and the other two with pork. Although dressing up a hotdog with themed toppings sounds interesting, it translates poorly to a good experience. \u00a0The sausages seemed like supermarket quality - Bubbledogs could stand to invest a little more in the core item. Last but not least, we were sat an at excuse of a railing. It was 20cm wide - narrow enough so that we couldn't even fit the menu, let alone the food and drinks when they came. If you plan on going, I highly recommend that you wait an extra 20 minutes for a proper table.Luckily for us, we went on a Saturday around 1PM so had no queue to wait - otherwise we would have been sourly disappointed. If you haven't already, try Meatliquor and Burger and Lobster - you will also need to stand in the queue for some time, but the food will certainly make it worth the wait.",

    "text": "Ah, sweet 8th of March! You arrived at last! After nearly three months of waiting, the day of our Bubbledogs reservation has arrived!! ...... As Nida K. (yelper + roomie) mentioned, we did wait three months for it, as it was the soonest we could get a big party in on a Friday night. Doing the math, that means, yes, I called in December for a reservation in March. Okay, okay, no big. American style hot dogs are SO worth the wait, right?!So we arrived, a group of lovely ladies, ready to enjoy the renowned combo of hot dogs and champagne. We ordered the bubbly and the dogs, and chatted. The first round arrived, and after a thorough photo documentation, we devoured. Still hungry, we went for a second round. The grand damage? \u00a326 for two hot dogs (the 4th of July and the Buffalo style), a side of sweet potato fries, and a glass of the ros\u00e9 champagne. A bit hefty, especially considering that I know how much all-beef hotdogs really cost. That being said, it was an experience. Like so many places in London, I paid for the chance to say I've been there. I paid for a night of tasty and interesting ingredients on hot dogs, and a variety of innuendos inspired by the various foods we ate (the Horny Dog (corndog) was a particular source of inspiration...). It was a good meal, on the high end, but enjoyable nonetheless. I'm not sure I would wait three months for it, or the forty-plus minutes you're likely to queue without a reservation, but it's certainly worth giving a shot. After all, how often do you find funky places like this in London?",

As good as the dogs and champagne selection is, it's the bubbly atmosphere of everyone there...it's just happy. The staff is happy and it just floats around to everyone there. I had the Chippy and loved it, my friend had the veggie hot dog and couldn't get over how incredible it tasted. The owners had told us that they tested so many veggie hot dogs amongst many vegetarians to get to this amazing tasting dog. I was jealous I didn't order it myself. \u00a0Don't miss trying this place!",

Neither appealed but settled on the side bar. The place is pretty funky with good attention nto detail, quirky hot dog themed pictures on the wall and bubble style lamp shades. Service was quick and friendly but didnt go further than taking an order and then bringing the food.We both went for the chilli dog, sweet potato fries and being early I settled for a dandelion and burdock. \u00a0The drink was good, and the fries generous portion and tasty. The hotdogs didnt quite meet my expectations though. Haven been given the choice I opted for pork over beef. I was presented what in my opinion was a very \"standard\" hot dog. It was ok in taste and the portion was ok.... However if your half your gimmick is hotdogs I wanted more!! Either in creation or portion. Overall for the price it was reasonable but other restaurants in the same genre as this one \u00a0are better... walk the extra 15mins to meat liquor.",

    "text": "The hype is up as the bubbles pop. On this early Friday night the queue was around two hours, however we didn't mind as our group had a lot to catch up on and a couple of us did a cheeky one by popping in to the nearby Tesco to grab a few fizzy ones for our wait - the premises do not have an off-license and therefore cannot relieve your time in the queue with an aperatif.Once in, as the table was being prepared, we were first seated by the bar. The selection of champers can be blinding and Bubbledogs only sell small local produces. A nice touch. However as none of us could be considered experts, we settled for the barmaid's suggestion - a fresh n clean Laherte Fr\u00e8res, Blanc de Blancs, Chavot. \u00a0Lovely and thirst quenching, we decided momentarily. The table was soon ready and our orders of a naked, new yorker, ploughmans and jos\u00e9 dog, plus tots and sweet potato sides were swiftly laid on the table. The hotdogs \u00a0filled the spot after a long wait but the expectations had been set higher. The buns lacked personality and were on the small size, the pork dog itself somewhat flavourless. \u00a0So instead, the sweet potato fries were the highlight for me. A girl of simple tastes. Overall we forgave the slight underwhelmingness of the dogs and had a great time. \u00a0I loved the simplicity of the concept and the place generally pulls together rather well. Price-wise you will find nothing outrageous for London and the rustic/vintage interior is a delight to soak in.",

As its new they recommendbooking but it opens at 11.30am (perfect brunch/need for hangover food time) somy friend and I took a brisk walk to clear our heads and took our chances onarriving early and getting a table. Success not only were we pleased to see an almost emptyvenue (this changed very quickly and by the time we left an hour later it waspacked to the rafters with people that seemed to be a mix of locals as well asLondoners and tourists. Outside a cool grey exterior with a neon red sign greetsyou, Inside this restaurant is quiet small with exposed girders and low hanging round balls oflighting \u00a0the air conditioning pipes are exposed giving an industrial feel whichis made to feel warmer by the wooden tables and seats. It has quiet large barwhich you can eat at \u00a0but we preferred the high tables which when busy beprepared to share if its just 2 to 4 of you (rather like a Wagamama). Usuallysharing is fun but we did seem to get a very grumpy girl and her friends wholooked extremely bored of her moaning endlessly about some boyfriend \u00a0as shewas not drowning her sorrows with the lovely champagne we decided to haveanother glass each and be her champion! An incredibly nice and chirpy waitress gave us our menus andobviously picked up on the fact we were feeling slightly delicate and ratherbrain dead so proceeded to gently talk us through the fantastic array of beef or porkhotdogs, then recommended a champagne to try that had less sugar than most \u00a0I can'tquiet remember what it was called or what the process was that made it lesscalorific but it cost \u00a39.50 a glass and was absolutely delicious and did justthe job in cleansing the palate/waking us up /complimenting the hot dogs wechose. It was also a middle priced glass which suited our budget that day. I'm afraid due to our condition we decided on pretty classicHotdogs we both close the Classic American \u00a0I had pork, my partner in crimehad beef and I had fried onions while I think he had some extra topping and wealso ordered some sweet potato fries (yum) and some other little potatoes bitesthat were so perfect for a hangover brunch we polished then off and orderedmore straight away! This place is gimmicky for sure with its menu specialising in hotdogsand champagne but it's a good gimmick and they do it very well. Some may think pricey \u00a0but compared to those ghastly cinemaexcuses for a hot dog this was fair and good value for money and left youfeeling full and satisfied. If you're looking for a quick, casual, stop off with friendseither for brunch, lunch or dinner before going on somewhere else then try it. They only take booking for 6 or more but people that cane inafter us were not having to wait long before being seated as it's not a laceyou would while away the hours in, Its basically fast food for a Fitzroviafoodie! you can also follow me or my tweets at @soraya72 or @FoodLovesLondon",

    "text": "I went today at lunch time, so getting a table was no problem as it was really quiet.The interior of the place is really nice, but seating is very sparse so I can see why you'd have to either book of wait a while for a spot.The service was really good and everybody who served us was very friendly.Neither me or my partner drink, so our trip there was really about the hotdogs. Upon looking through the menu, I started to wonder if this was going to be a problem seeing that there was about 100 pages of drinks to chose from! We finally got to the 1 page of food ( this was the last page and really should have been the first). There was a good selection of options to chose from along with being able to chose a pork, beef or veggie dog to go in them. I chose the Jos\u00e9 with a beef dog, which had guac, sour cream, salsa and jalape\u00f1os. My partner had the special which had jalape\u00f1os, Worcestershire sauce mayo and a couple of other things I can't remember. We had a side order of both tater tots and sweet potato fries, along with a dark cherry soda.The cherry soda was amazing and tasted exactly like cherries instead of artificial cherries which is often the case.My hotdog was ok but not amazing. The dog itself was extremely thin and had hardly anything to it. The flavours were actually quite bland and if it weren't for the jalape\u00f1os I don't think it would have tasted of much. I tried my partners and that was better. The mayo was delicious, but like mine, if it wasn't for that it would have tasted of nothing. The sweet potato fries were very delicious and the tater tots were even more delicious. Usually I douse things like that in ketchup, but they were seasoned really well and didn't even need the ketchup.My main gripe with this place is the actual sausage in the hotdog. These really need to be better as, although I hate to say it, you can get better out of a tin! They need to be bigger and have more flavor to them.There also needs to be more flavor in the fillings. The guac in mine tasted of nothing more than an unripe avocado - this is not guac!! The salsa also needs more flavor to it. The other suggestion would be that, seeing as there a fair amount of options for the hotdog toppings, it would be a good idea to do something like a sample tray so you could have 4 mini options on a plate. That way you're not forced to chose. They clearly focus on the drinks aspect and I guess if that's what you go for, and you drink enough, you won't care what the food tastes like. Would I go back? Doubtful. I certainly would queue up for it as It's really not worth it.",

    "text": "**This is a review for Bubbledogs' 'Kitchen Table' plus small sample of Bubbledogs itself**I am surprised that Bubbledogs itself only has one review so far given the throngs queued outside on the very rainy evening that I paid a visit.I smugly got to jump said queue because I had a booking for the 'Kitchen Table' which is a chef's table at the back of the restaurant. \u00a0Diners sit in a U-formation around the working kitchen where four chefs beaver away preparing your 12-13 course meal. \u00a0I shan't list all the courses but if you google reviews of kitchen table there are bloggers who have done so and attached requisite photos.I will say, however, that the meal was very good. \u00a0Chef James has an impressive CV (Ledbury, Marcus Wareing, Per Se, to name a few) and his experience shows in his cooking. \u00a0Some may complain that the dishes are not executed with finesse (no quenelles of ice-cream or exacting cuts of meat) but this is a labour of love rather than a quest to become an MOF; the dishes are rustically beautiful. \u00a0James sources his ingredients well and lets them do the talking. \u00a0He tells you where the produce comes from and he and his team forage for some of the produce. \u00a0The team works calmly and in harmony with James encouraging the team as they cook. \u00a0It's nice to see. \u00a0Some reviews have commented that dishes lack 'punch' but I disagree: many of the ingredients used are so delicate that you need to leave them be lest their delicate flavours get overshadowed. \u00a0I also like that James will, for example, use a whole roe deer from head to tail so the next seating might not get the same cut of meat as the previous one. \u00a0No wastage.The staff are generally very knowledgable (James' wife, Sania, is FOH and very sweet and friendly) and you can sense their very real interest in the food being prepared. \u00a0They obviously listen and watch the chefs preparing the food as they can talk about the dishes intelligently and thoughtfully. \u00a0James himself is also very approachable and has a sharp wit.Two small negatives. One is that my dining partner (male) was still a little hungry after the meal, as the portions are quite small. \u00a0We supplemented with a classic NY beefdog from out front. \u00a0It was very tasty; laden with onions and sauerkraut and laced with a hot sauce. \u00a0The second negative is that I asked for ice-water during the meal and our glasses were duly kept topped up. When the bill arrived we saw that we'd been charged for two bottles of mineral water. \u00a0Although I did point it out to the server and he said that he would check, blah, blah, it seemed churlish to argue the point: afterall, eight pounds in a 170-odd quid total is minimal. \u00a0Which brings me to the cost. \u00a0This place is not cheap but for the fact that the chefs take time to go out foraging and source such great ingredients, I am happy to pay.",

    "text": "Bubbledogs is an amazing concept. Bubbly, dogs. Two of my favourite things combined. Why not combine street food with a drink people consider to be upmarket? In this day and age everyone likes to be treated equal and even the fanciest among us must fancy a hot dog now and again.The party I was with was able to prebook as we needed a large table but, otherwise, it's a case of wait outside and keep those fingers crossed. We were shown to two tables next to each other but the seating hadn't quite been thought out as one member of the party had to sit awkwardly between the two. Sigh number one. The bubble here starts at around \u00a332 a bottle - and that's prosecco. Sigh number two. This place is already setting us back more than a meal out with drinks in Manchester. I know, I'm turning into a massive northern snob, constantly talking about how cheap it is oop'north compared to dawn'sarf, but still, it's true. My sloppy joe dog was, in all fairness, delicious; beef chilli over a pork hot dog, with crunchy onions and lovely gooey melty cheese. A combination of all my favourite things. The tater tots were amazing, food porn-esque morsels of fried potato, and the sweet potato fries looked like they could give them a run for their money. Service was quick and efficient but the whole experience was over so quickly it felt more like a lunch time pit stop than a dinner time feast.I'm so spoilt in Manchester with eateries such as Southern 11, SoLiTa, and Home Sweet Home all on the doorstep serving up hearty American food with prosecco flowing for around \u00a325 a bottle. Bubbledogs, keep it up, but don't expect the chatter to continue - a more unusual combination will come along eventually and then you'll be fighting for the custom. Lagercaviar, perhaps? Or Ciderquailseggs. Who knows. I don't think my future is in this naming game.",

Peeps have reported the veggie and beef dogs are equally as tasty. Oh how could I forget the champs, they are offered by the glass or bottle. However by the glass is cheaper unless you're in a group splitting. Highly recommend a reservation, the place gets busy quickly. Overall the dog prices are reasonable at \u00a3\u00a3 and the champs by the bottle I'd rank at \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3. Overall, it's a fun menu & establishment.",

Bubbledogs is a neat concept and while some tend to roll their eyes at the idea or say rut-ro, no way (Scooby-Doo reference) ... I say zoinks it was pretty darn good. What lured a non-hotdog-eating person into such a joint? Tater tots!!! Mmmm, I couldn't resist and the novelty of it all together seemed fun.We went on Valentine's, yeah I'm romantic too. We stood in line for about 1.5 hours as well. (they only take reservations for 6 or more) Now you're thinking rut-ro this guy is crazy, right? Well we found some friends in line and passed the time by having a few beers fetched from a local store. While waiting the staff kindly came out to check on us and pass around some of the fabulous tater tots my mouth was watering for all night. Once inside their cozy place I found the restaurant charming and fun. The staff was great, bartenders are fantastic as I watched them craft some cocktails. You'll get a kick out of the menu with various kinds of hotdogs to enjoy from the New Yorker to the dog du jour which had Foie gras. Don't worry if you're not into posh/fancy dogs you have have a Naked Dog. Sadly the only thing unavailable that night was the sweet potato fries which means I'll just have to go back and try. I'd say if you're looking for something different, fun and a doggone good time then head off to Bubbledogs y'all and maybe I'll see ya there!",

    "text": "Bubbledogs = Champagne + gourmet hotdogs. Despite the strangeness of the combination, Bubbledogs manages to make it work, at least as far as the food is concerned. I highly recommend the Buffalo Dog (get extra buffalo hot sauce) and the New Yorker as far as dogs go. Bubbles are expensive with the cheapest bottle running around \u00a340 - if only it was BYO!On the particular day we had chosen to give Bubbledogs a go, we arrived around 12.30 and were told there would be an hour wait as they had a reservation for 22 people coming in. I'm not too fussed they take reservations for groups of 6 or more but this is taking the cake just a little when the entire restaurant would only be able to hit 30 covers at a push. At that point, shouldn't you require they book out the whole place instead? Meet up at the place itself as you'll need to physically hold your space in line. Although they write down your name, they don't take down a phone number or anything else which would enable them to call you. \u00a0The hostess will encourage you to pop down the street to Tesco and purchase some drinks to have while you wait but can't serve you from the bar which is literally just a few feet away. Alex S and I headed down with Nava N and Nida K held the fort - we got a ton of cider and had barely cracked them open when our table was called (after 20 mins not the expected hour - luckily they let us take our drinks with us).Honestly, pretty much every dog is good so go with what you like. For me, it was the Buffalo and the K-Dawg (topped with kimchi) that called out. I opted for one beef and one pork sausage but I would be hard pressed to tell you which one was which. Both were meaty and tasty but the toppings mostly overwhelmed the flavours. That being said, a hot dog to me should be something with a meaty base but really defined by the way its grilled and the choice of toppings - so no complaints at all on that front. The brioche rolls are also perfect and do a fair job of bearing up under the weight of the sauces.Overall, I think the dogs represent good value but the bubbles are probably a bit out of my comfort zone when it comes to price. Tasty, yes, but not enough value and it strikes a discordant note with me to have a dog in one hand and a champagne flute in the other.",

I was about to find out!They say third times the charm and it took me about 3 tries to even get into this place because they don't take reservations for less than 6 people and inside it's barely big enough to swing a cat. Not that you would in a place called dog ;)The queue is always a mile long, so I was looking forward to seeing what was on offer.I was very hungry so went with a New Yorker (of course), the institution that is The Sloppy Joe and some sweet potato fries. For the champers, we went with a bottle of the Juillet-Lallement, Ros\u00e9, Grand Cru, Brut followed by the Varnier-Fanni\u00e8re, Grand Cru, Brut. Both the gourmet hotdogs and grower champagnes were fantastic.These are obviously not things which anyone would ever associate together. I've never been at a baseball game eating a hot dog and thought to myself \"if only I had a bottle of Juillet-Lallement, Ros\u00e9, Grand Cru, Brut to wash this down with\", but suprisingly they go very well together. Bubbledogs has hit a niche market like a lot of restaurants in London offering uniquely matched food and drink but I think this place will have queues all the way up to the BT tower until somebody comes up with a new idea!",

And, given it is right down the street from my work on the already happening Charlotte Street, why not check it out at least a couple days.Now, it is probably worth mentioning that I've been around the hotdog block a few many times. \u00a0How can one resist passing one vendor after another on the streets of NYC without stopping for a bite? \u00a0Therefore, I walked into Bubbledogs having some high expectations of a good dog. \u00a01 - Too much bread! If i'm going to be gorging myself on a thoroughly unhealthy combination of meat - it better be a lot. I guess I was just expecting a larger dog coming out at either end. \u00a0I guess it seems typical for an American to be complaining about portions, but I was a bit disappointed at the bread/topping to meat ratio2- Champagne - alright, this part is cool. Nothing like a little business lunch date of food normally reserved for baseball stadiums and then sipping on a glass of bubbles. It was like entering the box.3- Ambiance - Eh. For what I'm paying for a hot dog and alcohol, I wasn't much a fan of the sitting arrangement. \u00a0Stool seating is never too comfortable, and I tend to reserve the experience for diners. \u00a0It was hard to have a conversation given the set up and awkwardly placed seating. \u00a0We were also angled in such a way that we had to adjust to the waiter coming by with almost every order.I felt like I had to try this place out given all the hype and long lines but I doubt I'll be popping by again. \u00a02 thumbs up for concept but unfortunately, this didn't provide the taste of \"home\" that I was hoping for.",

    "text": "I paid attention to the concept already when the first articles of a new restaurant came out. Cmon, hot dogs and champagne, can it get better than this? Bubbledogs has become one of my favorite places in London since it opened and a sure stop when friends are visiting.On the dogs: Definitely good value for money! . There is a good selection of around 10 different dogs with witty names and themes from market foods around the world. All the dogs have an option of either beef, pork or vegetarian sausage. After serious dog tasting I have found my favorite to be the BLT dog, (BLT= bacon, lettuce and truffle). It is not easy to wrong with bacon, and the truffle gives the dog an extra creamy taste I am not sure what the lettuce is doing there, perhaps it gives color. Other favorites include the Jose dog, with avocado and salsa; K-Dawg with Kimchi and the Sloppy Joe with chilli. The problem is that one would like to try out all of them at once, but for me two dogs already equal a full meal. The menu has remained quite constant for the first 6 months after the opening, but I am intrigued to see if new dogs will appear over time (have to go back to check now and then =). On the drinks: The champagne menu is extensive and reasonably priced. If you are enough people to share a bottle (or just in the mood), the selection is wide. There are both big and small producers, vintages and rose champagnes on the list to choose from. One needs to go back many times if attempting to try all of them (I am tempted). For people having just a glass, there are around 5-6 good options. There are also cocktails on the menu, but hey, this is champagne haven, you can go for cocktails somewhere else. \u00a0On the service: The staff is definitely friendly and helpful. But the idea seems to be to get people in and out as fast as possible. I get it that there is a queue outside, but the early bird gets the worm; and I like enjoying my dogs and bubbly with no hurry. If you want to get in without waiting the best time to go is when it opens, 17:30.",

    "text": "Apparently a place that serves champagne and hot dogs in London is a big deal. Such a big deal that my roomie, Valerie S., booked a table 3 months in advance. When the day finally arrived, I made my way to Charlotte St. and figured out that it must be the place with the long queue outside. Oh yeah, and it was raining. I pushed my way past the people to the front door and made it inside. It's a small place, and the whole atmosphere is very cute and girly. The host showed me to the table as I was the first to arrive. I'm not a huge fan of champagne so I went straight to looking at the hot dog menu. So many choices, not enough stomach space to fit them all. I decided to go with the Breakie with a pork hotdog, bacon-wrapped, fried egg, and black pudding. Basically anything on any menu with a fried egg on it speaks to me. It was delicious! Messy, but all around fantastic. Everyone ordered different hotdogs and champagne and by the time we were all done, some of us decided to go for another round since there was some room left. We figured we waited 3 months for this so we might as well, shoot. My second order was the Buffalo with a pork hotdog, buffalo sauce, bleu cheese, and celery. I wasn't a huge fan of this. The buffalo sauce needs some work, it was just way too plain. Oh yeah, they also have sweet potato fries... which I'm basically in love with and can't seem to keep my hands off them if they're in front of me.A great experience here with 7 gals and I'd gladly do it again. The food is good... I wouldn't wait in a line for it, but if we made reservations in advance I'd come back for sure to try some more of their dogs.",

    "text": "I think I'm in love. And its name is Bubbledogs.I've been wanting to come here for ages. But I hate to queue. It's usually not worth it. So we rolled up at around 6:30 on a Saturday hoping the queue wasn't going to be terrible. It wasn't. We were eventually told about 20-30 minutes. Unfortunately they can't serve bubbly in the queue, but there is a Tesco around the corner (as the guy manning the queue told us) so the other half ran over there to get some booze for the queue. Well by the time he returned our wait time reduced drastically so we didn't actually get to drink any of our back-up booze (but we'll keep it in mind for next time). The place is quite small so it's pretty much all shared seating if you're in a small group. You're either at a bar type area or sharing tables (if you're in a group of two) with other groups. We got seated at a small bar area overlooking the stairs down to the toilets. Honestly though, it was absolutely great seating as we got to check out the amazing art hanging on the wall there (we saw some we wanted to take home, but I'm pretty sure they're not for sale). The menu is comical. Pages upon pages of bubbly and one page of food. It could take ages to work your way through it all. We were looking at some pink champagne (our favorite), and our awesome server asked us if we have ever had English sparkling. We said we have and we love it. So he recommended the Balfour (which we've had), but it's a more recent vintage and different. He was right it was fantastic.Now the food: The special for the night was a lobster roll. We ordered that and a horny dog (corn dog), buffalo dog and a sloppy joe (chili dog) with both tots and sweet potato fries for a sides and split everything. My favorite was the buffalo dog: buffalo sauce with hunks of blue cheese and onion. Fantastic. My next was the horny dog (but I love corn dogs and reminds me of being a kid). Then the lobster roll and the chili dog. It was a sweet chili and I was expecting heat, but it was still tasty. The tots were fantastic. Not the frozen stuff I grew up with as a kid, but an amazing taste sensation. The fries were amazing too! Everything about Bubbledogs was great: Champagne, food and service. Our server would always make sure we had enough bubbles, and even commented that the other half managed to beat him at one point when his glass was empty for a split second before he could fill it. He also chatted with us about so much stuff about drinks, food, art and everything. We'll be back. There were many more hot dogs on the menu we wanted to try and probably more Champagne as well. It's worth the queue as well (especially knowing we can go get something to tide us over from Tesco until we get through). Yes it's over-hyped but my high expectations were not only met but exceeded by my night here. And if they can do that on a Saturday night, I imagine they can do it any night.",

Despite the smallness, Bubbledogs is adorable inside, and I totally wanted to snatch some of the cute wiener dog art off the walls and take it home with me.I had two dogs: the Fourth of July with a beef dog, and the Brekkie with a pork dog. \u00a0I also had bites of several others, including the K-Dawg and the Sloppy Joe. \u00a0The standouts to me were definitely the two that I ordered! \u00a0The Fourth of July is just perfect with the beef dog, and there's a maple syrupy goodness to the Brekkie that is not to be missed! \u00a0Not to mention, the egg was really nicely fried such that I was able to neatly break the yolk with a sweet potato fry and drizzle said yolky goodness all over the dog. \u00a0I will say that I preferred the beef dogs to the pork dogs by a mile, but that's not to say the pork isn't good.And can I just devote a separate paragraph to the marvel that is the Bubbledogs tater tots? \u00a0There. \u00a0There it is. \u00a0Separate paragraph for the tater tots alone. \u00a0Holy cow, they are delicious. \u00a0Fried and fresh and perfectly salted. \u00a0Drool-worthy.Visit! \u00a0It's cute and delicious and service is really nice, so it's totally worth the queue.",

    "text": "This place was decent, but in my mind doesn't really deserve the crazy hype or the queues. The concept is simple and intriguing: hot dogs and champagne. They have a number of very inventive combinations, such as a BLT (hot dog wrapped in bacon with lettuce and tomato), a Caesar (done up with Caesar salad fixings), and a Reuben (with swiss cheese, Russian dressing, and sauerkraut), just to name a few.I settled for the Reuben veggie dog (I don't eat red meat) and the others in my group got sloppy joes and a caesar. My Reuben was pretty good honestly. I would say it was the best veggie hot dog I've had and they got the texture dead on. The Reuben toppings all seemed to come together and work, even though I was a bit apprehensive. I washed it all down with a few glasses of sparkling ros\u00e9. Everyone else in my group seemed to enjoy their choices as well. We got a few sides of tater tots and sweet potato fries, which were decent, not amazing in spite of reviews raving about them. The service was very good. Our server was very attentive and helpful. The ambiance was nice. Exposed brick and cute kitschy decor - felt pretty Williamsburg. So why only three stars? Maybe I'm just a picky spolied American, \u00a0but I don't think a hot dog should cost 7 pounds. Ever. For the price, I would have wanted to be blown away. It was decent, but a place like this would really need to step up their game in NYC, where a great hot dog comes in at a fraction of the price. Overall, I'd say this isn't a must-do, certainly not if you need to queue for 2 hours beforehand.",

    "text": "Brilliant concept, great atmosphere, delicious champers, but the food... just alright. The place only really serves one thing: hot dogs, and for that, those dogs should be damn good. But it was nothing special, an ordinary, skinny dog with some funky toppings. I could probably make that on my own, and I'm a terrible cook. Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh, after all in New York you've got places like Crif Dogs and Japadog, which load delicious hot dogs with delicious toppings and it hits the spot like no other, but still I had expected this place to compare. I had the Reuben, my dinner companion had the corn dog. They were good, but we just weren't blown away.That said, the tots and sweet potato fries were amazing. It's a cool bar and a great name, so would recommend checking it out just for the experience and to say you've been to a hot dog champagne bar (what???) but don't go with high expectations.",

I'm not a big fan of champers, but I was definitely impressed by the pages of options we had. We picked a bottle and, not being a connoisseur, it tasted fine to me. My issue is with the hot dog. I had the beef date dog. The bun to hot dog and topping ratio was all wrong. There was too much bun and not enough beef/toppings. The actual hot dog was quite thin and lacked flavour. When I took a bite, there was no snap of the casing and the inside was not juicy. I didn't taste much garlic at all, and there was only a scant amount of onions within the bun. The sour cream on top was, again bland. The sweet potato fries were delicious and the service was great. However, I can't say I would recommend this place to anyone.

There is also a 14 course degastation which can be booked up to the three months in advance.You won't find any mass market champers brands. Bubbledogs prides themselves on offering individual small producers who grow and make their own product.There are 4-5 types of champers by the glass ranging from \u00a36.50 -16 as well as a range of bottles available. If the bubbles are too much, there are beers, spirits and cocktails.If you want to avoid the wait, head in before 7pm or get a reservation.The space is long and thin with small tables good for 4 or 6 at a squeeze along the side. I'm definitely a fan!",

There was always an excuse why i didn't go but finally managed to russle up the time to visit, and I wasn't disappointed!The champagne is amazing and a great variety, its nice you don't have to pay \u00a320 pound a glass like your normal London restaurant, and the choice of toppings for the Hot Dogs made my jaw drop, Mac N Cheese on a hot dog.... Yes bloody please! Give me severalI wish i could have had more, there is one thing i would have to say i was disappointed about for a restaurant with only 1 item that is customisable, the quality of the buns really got to me, I mean guys please the Bun is like half the meal! get a nice Brioche bun in there and your golden.Shout out for the waiting staff, who seemed to be slated on Yelp, but i thought were lovely and helpful!Peace and Love",

I absolutely love this place!I have only been here once so far after having a few too many cocktails and looking for some scrumptious food to fill the belly! I had the Reuben beef Hot dog(with sauerkraut, Russian Dressing and melted swiss cheese \u00a37) and sweet potato fries (\u00a33.50). I can honestly say this is the best hot dog I have ever had, definitely trumps any of the trendy burger chains too... Plus the \"sweet potato\" fries & champagne combo make you feel like you are being healthy & classy at the same time as eating a hotdog haha. :)Really chillaxed quirky venue with cute features like the collage on the bathroom walls of restaurant menus that Sandia & James have dined at. Great place to start the night (or end it) in Fitzrovia, LondonP.s I here the \"Kitchen Table\" hidden through the back of Bubbledogs has a highly recommended tasting menu that I am still to try..",

We were seated at the stool seating next to the staircase so it was a bit cramped but we didn't mind on that particular day.There's something about hot dogs that just never quite clicked with me. I've tried ones at picnics and barbecues, ball parks, gourmet sausages on rolls, and bratwursts in Berlin. I like sausages on their own cut up and even corn dogs once in awhile but I don't know what it is - when the sausage is combined with that roll and toppings, it never pleases or amazes me. The only time I ever enjoy a hot dog is drunk on the streets of SF or LA when it comes wrapped in bacon and topped with caramelized onions and ketchup, mayo, and mustard.I had the Breakfast Dog because it sounded unique and the most interesting with the black pudding bits (blood sausage). The toppings were good but I didn't find the sausage that great so the overall experience was somewhat forgettable for me. The tots and fries were good.I don't think the pairing of hot dogs and champagne necessarily adds to the actual tasting experience other than being kitschy.",

I wish I had room to eat a second because I would have.We ordered:Mac Daddy - The mac n' cheese drew me to this dog of course, who doesn't love mac n' cheese. Overall, the taste of the wiener (I got pork) overpowered the mac n' cheese, which in retrospect, makes sense. I probably wouldn't order this particular one again because I like bolder flavors.Trishna - SO GOOOOOD! The mango chutney and mint sauce make this dog delightful. It's definitely their Indian flavored wiener (don't worry it's not spicy). If you like Indian food, you'll love this dog.Tater tots - must getSweet Potato fries - crispy and delicious",

    "text": "My friend has wanted to visit Bubbledogs ever since they opened but the last time she was in town they were closed. So when she visited me again this weekend just past to make sure that she didn't miss out we went along straight from work on Friday evening. The concept behind Bubbledogs is easy to understand if a little odd; glasses of champagne (the bubbles) are paired with hot dogs (the dogs) in a high-end meets low-end mashup.Inside is absolutely tiny with very high stools which weren't the most comfortable things to sit on. We were perched at the bar which was definitely the best place to be as you could watch the bartenders at work as they whipped up a cocktail or three.As we were there for the Bubbledogs experience we decided to skip the cocktails and try one of the champagnes on offer. The list is full of names that you probably won't recognise (no Laurent-Perrier or Bollinger here, instead they specialise in growers champagne made by farmers in smaller champagne houses. We both had glasses of the Raventos i Blanc, De Nit, Ros\u00e9, 2010 - Sant Sadurni d'Anoia simply because it was the cheaper of the two ros\u00e9s on offer - sorry I'm not an expert in champagne whatsoever but it was very crisp and delicious!For food I ordered the Mac Daddy - a hot dog smothered in macaroni cheese and topped with fried crispy onions and bacon bits. When it arrived in a little red plastic basket which you would expect in an American diner I was a bit disappointed. It was OK \u00a0and I absolutely adored the crispy onions but I thought it was relatively small for the \u00a38 price tag and could have been improved by something a bit different, perhaps a crusty baguette, from the standard hotdog buns that were served which struggled to contain the toppings. We also had a side of the sweet potato fries to share which were the absolute best. Crispy on the outside yet still lovely and fluffy on the inside.My main complaint was that the service was slow which we didn't mind too much as we were too busy getting caught up but it took us quite a while to get someone to take our order despite trying desperately to catch the eye of one of the waiters. It's definitely a fun concept to indulge in once and the place certainly filled up around us as the night went on with people waiting outside when we left so it's obviously a popular location but I think you can probably get more bang for your buck elsewhere in London.",

The \"bar\" seating is more like you're eating off a shelf, crammed in the walkway all servers and patrons use to get to the kitchen/toilet/back seating. We ended up there.I was disappointed they removed the awesome sounding Buffalo dog from the menu (and even asked after it in case they'd make it anyway - they wouldn't). I was advised to go for the kimchi or the 4th of july, which is a poor comparison ... fermented red bean paste and BBq sauce taste nothing like buffalo wing hot sauce, I'm afraid. So I went for the caesar, and my husband got the chili dog. He loved his and mine was ok. I too was seriously disappointed by the quality of the dog and the bun. The was super skinny and swallowed up by the tasteless bun. Also, the menu stated the dog had \"carmalised lettuce\" which didn't compute with me but I thought maybe I've been missing something about cooking lettuce in oil my whole life. Turns out it was just limp, greasy hot lettuce. Bummer.Service was nice enough, though it I had to grab a waiter in order to get even a drink after being seated 10 minutes (keep in mind I was in a high traffic area, not stuck in some corner). The tater tots and sweet potato fries were great, my cocktail was lovely and refreshing and the wine good, too.One of my favorite things is comfort food done gourmet style, and thought I would absolutely love this place, but it just didn't deliver.",

The restaurant has a nice urban chic feel to it and the waiters are very nicely dressed in uniform and very attentive. The menu is simple and well designed. The champagne is expensive, but hey it's champagne and we did not complain about the champagne.But ... I don't think I will go again. Yes, the champagne was nice and the atmosphere was great, but the combination of champagne with ordinary hot dog did not work for me. The hot dogs are really the usual, rather small sausage in a bun ... and they come in a plastic basket. \"Why not? That's the way to serve a hot dog!\" I hear you say ... but ... it's so out of character for the place they created. I think they should have gone all the way with the kitsch and the retro dinner idea ... then add the champagne. Instead they went with the champagne bar concept ... and then added fat and greasy (overprized) food. Anyway the hot dogs were nice, but I could have eaten three of them, plus sides.It's a novelty for sure and in the future I can say: \"Do you remember? A few years back they had this strange champagne bar thing with the hot dogs?! That was quite something.\"",

    "text": "Champagne and hot dogs, what more could you ask for? I was in Paris for work, and had some friends in London that told me about this restaurant, and I (almost) immediately hopped on the Eurostar and met them for dinner. Long story short: I did excessive amounts of travel to get to this place, and I STILL think it deserves 5 stars.It opens at 5:30 on weekdays, which we found out when we arrived at 5:00. But no problem, we were the first to be seated! The atmosphere is cozy and trendy at the same time, a tricky mix to accomplish. Make sure you look up and notice the champagne-bubble-style light fixtures! The food was superb. The hot dogs were clearly made of quality beef - not like the cheap-o hot dogs you can get at the grocer. Our table had the \"horny dog\" the \"BLT\" and the \"Mac Daddy\" - everyone was super happy with their orders.The champagne list is extensive which is a necessity. We ordered a bottle of ros\u00e9 because we had heard that the glass portions were small and PRO-TIP if you order a bottle, you get 2 hot dogs for free. Their version of a \"meal-deal\".When we were done eating we gave up our table and moved to the bar to finish our bottle. The bartender was friendly and helped guide us to our next stop of the night. You absolutely MUST try Bubbledogs next time you're in London.",

Service was top notch as well, friendly and attentive and efficient.Not 5 star only because i think the flavors could have been a tad more robust, and the potato skins were a bit more like wedge fries than skins, with the chive sauce also maybe needing a bit more punch. Otherwise the mac daddy (the hotdog) was well balanced, and held up extraordinary well (u always worry if itll fall apart due to the extras).Extensive champagne list and plenty of by the glass",

I put this place on my itinerary as soon as my friends and I booked our tickets for spring break in London (not entirely the typical spring break destination but worth it!). As someone who spent much of her freshman year of college running on the joke that she was dating a hot dog (and thus consuming MANY hotdogs), this place was a must! The service was very impressive, though t was a bit slow (in the restaurant not with regards to service) so I can't attest to how they are when busy! I ordered the Mac Daddy dog with a side of sweet potato fries, which happen to be another love near and dear to my heart. Let's talk dogs first though: the hot dog was amazing especially with the mac and cheese which had just the right consistency to our with a hot dog but not overpower it (I'm aware I'm speaking on a hot dog but it really is an art form if you do it right). The sweet potato fries were good, a little bland, but I have Cajun taste from my family in Louisiana so I can't blame them for not being able to meet my standards. I'm sorry to say that I cannot tell you what I drank, I think maybe proseco of some sort. I was an American on spring break after all they do start to blend! But I would recommend this place to anyone and I will be returning to London and back to this restaurant again, hopefully soon!",

Luckily there wasn't a line to get in when I arrived or I would have been mad at myself for waiting. Skip this place. There are much better places in the city to eat. If you still choose to go here skip the hotdogs and order champagne and tots. That's still just as fancy right? lol",

    "text": "Bubbledogs has been a sort of mythical place in London for the best part of the last year (2013) so it was with quite an amusement that we actually got a chance to dine there. I was looking forward into trying it out almost immediately once it was open, but then I was visiting London just for a few short days and it requires a trip to Fitzrovia and some amount of patience to actually get a table.We were told we would need to wait 2h for a table or we could immediately be sited at the bar. We were quite lucky I guess but they anyway take reservations only for the groups of six or larger (I guess because their sitting options are table with bar stools for six to eight people). So maybe our sitting arrangements were not very comfy but still it wasn't much different then the other people in the place.After you've finished browsing 100-or-so pages of their bubbles selection (it's not all champagne but it's all bubbly) you finally arrive at their dog selection. Which are quite nice: naked dog (just bun + sausage), Reubens (with 'slaw), Sloppy Joe etc. You are always left with a selection of turkey, beef or pork dog. And they are really tasty!Plus the bubbles. It is fancy and it is a nice idea and it is definitely worth exploring if you are tired off all the other options like burgers, pulled pork sandwiches and so on.",

    "text": "Just to clarify that place serves HOT DOGS and CHAMPAGNE. Surely that alone is enough to convince about 88% of the adult population of London to visit. I called in during the week with my friend Tasha, who had left me waiting for her in the cold for an hour while she dealt with some sort of real life emergency. It was actually too busy when we went, but the host said he'd drop us a text in 45 minutes when a table would be free. We went to a local pub and warmed our cockles on some vino in the meanwhile.When we went to claim our table, it became clear why we had to wait at all. Bubbledogs is TINY. Like, my bum barely fit through the door. It's also kinda dark (basically a cave. You might as well hide a horcrux in there), but moving swiftly on. We were brought menus and decided that we'd get a dog, a side each and a bottle of champagne to share. As we looked around, most people seemed to be having a dog and a glass only. Apparently it's the done thing, especially on a Monday when that combination is on special for a tenner. One measly glass doesn't interest me though, so no hard feelings.I opted for the Fernando dog, which comes with chorizo, onion and peppers and a drizzle of garlic aioli. At this point, I must have been pretty drunk already because the waitress asked if I wanted pork or beef and I thought she was talking about the chorizo. Hoho. Anyway, I cleverly kept my trap shut and got all the pork goodness. My friend got the Sloppy Joe, which was obviously drenched in chilli and cheddar. Not only were the hotdogs amazing, but our sweet potato sides were to die for as well.I believe it was John Lennon who said \"Everything will be OK in the end. If it's not OK, it's not the end.\" Well, everything wasn't OK and this wasn't the bloody end. We wanted more pork! More booze! So when we called over the waitress and she clearly thought we wanted the bill, we demanded more hot dogs (I got the Sloppy Joe, can't remember what Tashbag got) and another bottle. BAZINGA! Bubbledogs 4 lyfe.",

The concept wasn't so clear to me because I couldn't read the neon sign outside. \"Bubbledogs.\" It's not as laid back or roomy as a pub, but we were able to have a drink, a bite (mandatory) and a fairly comfortably chat.Instead of the bubbles (aka Champagne) we had beer from the small 4 choice list. These were mostly local brews, like Pressure Drop. We did get some dogs, but it took a minute to understand the concept. My buffalo (pork) dog came loaded with the classic buffalo sauce: tangy, spicy. Added was blue cheese cubes and onion. Pretty tasty and not too salty. We shared the sweet potato fries. These seem to be a new introduction to London, yet you'll see see them in every self-respecting burger and gastro pub in Los Angeles. I Washed it down with that Pressure Drop beer. Despite it being cramped, I liked this place for its vibe and for bringing champagne down from its lux podium. Perfect for after work with a couple of people. The selection of dogs is better than some, but there's still no \"healthy\" meat, like chicken, although there is a vegetarian dog. I hear in the rear of this place is a fine dining restaurant which requires reservations. In L.A. The hotdog craze was probably kicked off by Wurtkusche in the Arts District. It has very exotic meat dogs, but served in a regular way as the flavour is in dog, not the toppings. It also serves up beers, not bubbles.",

I got the philly hot dog which was pretty good. The atmosphere is chic rustic/cute. The tater-tots and sweet potato fries are amazing!",
