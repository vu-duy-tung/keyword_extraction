    "text": "A great music venue and Restaurant, Hoxton bar and kitchen is located in the heart of the Shoreditch triangle. \u00a0 It attracts an eclectic mix of city suits, artists and fashionable students, mostly an older crowd who can afford to pay the extortionate prices. \u00a0Saying that its no different really from the neighbouring venues, come to this part of town and you have to be prepared to part with a significant amount of cash for a few cocktails. I've seen a few live gigs here, which always attract a large crowd, usually filling the 450 capacity bar, get there early, be prepared to queue, or miss out altogether. \u00a0The dance floor gets so busy you might end up stuck at the other end from the bar. \u00a0 But it makes for a good atmosphere, you wouldn't want to go to an empty bar on a Friday night.The vibe is completely different during the day, serving food from 11am, it attracts families as well as the usual evening clientele. \u00a0 The menu is varied, from Hoxton burgers to delicious pancakes and maple syrup. \u00a0 I haven't eaten there during the evening, I'm not sure it would be my first choice of restaurants when most people are there for the music and alcohol. \u00a0Plenty of better options for food in the area, personally I'd just grab a mojito and head for the dance floor.",

Pregame is essential b/c otherwise you're going to have the nick-name calamari because you fried so many squids. (squid=quid, you'll spend a lot, I thought it sounded good.) Good fun, but bring friends. I have had good nights here, but looking back, I think that this was based primarily on the company. People are v. stuck up and i don't think they know how to let their hair down, possibly the one place in Hoxton where this is true. Either that, or the couple of times I was there I went a little too hard. Thus the good times, but overall there is something lacking here. Great venue, but much too expensive, and in the end a little shitty to you around the edges. Hoxton should be full of attitude, but not the kind that that feels like it deserves your approval. Enjoyable, but you can find a better place in the surrounding area. Peace.",

They serve a wicked brunch for \u00c2\u00a37, great veggie options too. Beer is expensive but you can chill out on the sofa's and enjoy the scenester spotting. The place gets incredibly busy at the weekend, so if your going for a night out expect to queue. It's not open late enough for my liking, and its a bit outlandish to the point of pretentious. There is a lot of seating space outside so you can enjoy a summer beer basking in the sunshine. Also, great to nip for a wee if you're sitting drinking in Hoxton Square!!",

This is one of the issues with Hoxton Bar & Kitchen- Oh look, it's in Hoxton, it's still sort of trendy, but every man in the place looks like he's just arrived from the office after a long day of number crunching. But it's OK, because it's so dark inside HB&K that you can't really see anyone, just as well really. Having said this, there is a good buzz to the place, the drinks aren't too extortionate, they have very comfy sofas in the back, and you're close to some good clubs to move onto later in the evening.

I saw the Soho Dolls here for their album launch and it was packed, and had a great vibe to it. Ofcourse, with the smoking ban you have to go outside and they have created an area for this, although no drinks allowed here. The foods great, the music alwasy good, and the sound system actually really good. I liked it here, and would go again.",

Arrived just after 6pm on a saturday night & most of the tables were already taken - except fortunately we managed to grab a fantastically positioned one at the very entrance with a large table area to hold all of our group - perfect for the smokers who could just pop in & out the main door into the heated outdoor section (drinks NOT allowed there by the overzealous bouncers!!).We ordered bar snacks for the whole table & they were average quality for normal bar food prices. Drinks however were expensive - probably not out of character for London areas but spirits were served in short tumbler glasses filled to the brim with ice & tasting very watered down...there were many an exclaimation of 'RIP OFF!'...Bar staff seemed friendly, but a bit too interested in chatting to one another than actually serving the public quickly - meaning it got jammed up fairly fast & getting a drink became a mission.The bar interior itself was great - dark & minimalist with music pumping very LOUDLY everywhere. Music was eclectic to say the least - with songs from Rod Stuart & Tina Turner being electrofied. Couldn't believe it when we saw a massive queue form from about 9pm onwards - the place was good but not that brilliant to stand for ages waiting to get in!Got VERY packed in tight as the night wore on, don't think I would've found it to be so enjoyable were it not for the table area we'd scored earlier in the night. People all seemed fairly friendly & up for chats with strangers - which is always nice ;)Had an additional band/dance area off the main section, but it also appeared to get densly packed really fast & the bar in there is small meaning getting a drink took forever. So I recommend getting there early & bagging a table for yourself if you plan on heading here with a group of peoplecos I think queuing to get inside would definitely take the shine off!",

On the plus side the food served is pretty good, the place is buzzing of an evening, and the venue part often hosts very good concerts (played through a brilliant sound sytem). On the other side of things the food served is overpriced, as are the drinks, and the staff as well as the clientele are, as i say, a bit TOO cool. Although the bouncers aren't so cool. It's about time that these meatheads were paid to stick around for an hour or so after the bar stops serving in venues across London, in order to allow people time to naturally filter out into the street after a nice evening out, saying good bye to friends etc. You just can't do that and leave with a nice warm feeling when some fat man is saying stupid things like just wait for your friend outside, sir. Don't you LOVE being called Sir when you feel they'd rather call you scum?! To be fair it's not just this venue that has this trouble, it's widespread, and goes with the territory, but if there's one thing that sites like this might be good for it's to let venues know that this is no longer acceptable!",

It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon and I was wandering around my neighborhood looking for a new place to eat. I had been by here a few times and looking at the people sitting outside and how good their meals looked I thought I'd stop by and have a bite. I walked in through the bar and into an empty restaurant, one guy behind the bar and no other staff. However, there were people sitting outside so i made my way out onto the patio, which was where i wanted to sit anyway. Once out there I caught the eye of the waitress and asked if it was okay to sit at an empty table next to me, she nodded yes and i sat down. a couple of min later the waitress came back and gave me a food and drink menu. So far so good, I was hungry and the food looked pretty good. then I waited, and waited, no one came by. I waited some more, and finally after sitting there having been ready to order for over 25 min I got up and went looking for someone to take my order. I could not find anyone. I went back to my table and sat for another 5 min and after still nothing i got up and left, I couldn't justify waiting over half an hour before someone even came over to ask my drink order in a restaurant with only 4 full tables. I know London is notorious for bad service but this was a bit overkill. I am not sure if I'll risk going in again, if i do, I may update my review, but for now I am giving one star based solely on the service.",

The place is large and separated by the cafe side and the larger bar side, though food is available on both and it's more about what kind of atmosphere you want. The other huge perk is there are comfy couches, quite a few tables and lots of folks working on laptops since HSBK also has free wifi. LOVE! They also have just enough wall outlets so that you can power up if you're there for a long time, as I have been in the past.In the evenings, it's a great place to meet friends for drinks and live music.

Situated in a sprawling space right on Hoxton Square, this uber cool cafe/bar also hosts regular gigs by both the prominent and the aspiring and attracts an interestingly mixed, if decidedly fashiony crowd.Sure, if you sat outside for long enough you'd probably spot many a celebrity - A, B, Z list, the Hoxton really doesn't discriminate - and the prices are higher than Shoreditch's many dive bars, but to hold that against this roomy bar is perhaps to miss the point. I happily frequented the Hoxton as a student, sitting for hours during the day with one espresso and taking advantage of its free Internet. If you drink like a fish your bar tab might break the bank but if you're simply after a few cocktails with an alternative and often glamorous crowd then you should definitely pay the Hoxton a visit.",

Seeing that they don't have to try with the food either - even the coolest and skinniest of Hoxtonites still get hungry tummies and will need feeding - I actually liked it. Still, someone tells me how a quesidilla is meant to have mashed potato in? Mine did. We split a full bodied bottle of red, and had a great time having a late supper.

From the massive stainless steel punched bar to the high-heeled posturing to the over-priced drinks, Hoxton Bar and Grill has got the worst elements of that area of East London down to a tee. I am a sucker for decking - I used to love it when Alan Titchmarsh and the guys used to go mad on someone's gnome-laden monstrosity. No joke - and so when I sauntered up to this place, I was kidded into thinking that I could have been mistaken in my presumptions about this graveyard of alternative culture...alas, my suspicions were correct. Hoxton square has been overrun by a bleached-haired, topshop adorned army, whose commanders-in-chief look suspiciously like they've been tango'd, and this is the altar that they all come to be sick on. It's brought all the things that the east end part of town was good for getting away from. I found the people rude, the atmosphere tense and the drink average. I didn't try the food, but it would have been a case of eating it out my hands as there were no tables to sit at. P.S. My mentioning of the stainless steel bar might sound odd, but my rule of thumb is that if a place is tasteless enough to incorporate that amount of mirrored-metal into a place where people's faces are the last thing I wanted to be reminded of, then it's generally not somewhere I wish to frequent.",

Walking through the centre of the room through almost a large square tunnel you fin parallel to the bar the restaurant. Both have outdoor seating areas.The queue to the bar on a Thursday, Friday and Saturday is crazy! A very popular large venue with loud music ranging from 70's to today's tunes. The restaurant is also extremely popular with really tasty food. Last week we had fish cakes and nachos (a bit of a random combination!) to share with drinks.

I had a salad as a main course and was left disappointed. It was basically just salad leaves. I was wondering if they had run out of all the other ingredients or just imagination? The rest of the menu was about burgers, ribs, steaks.. and worked all right but I heard no screams of joy. For a desert I had a piece of chocolate cake with ice cream and that was much better and we all continued to the dance floor with our stomachs full. There was no live gigs in that evening and the music was about the basic dance hits you hear every day from the radio.

Boy George would seem plain in this venue, all styles, cultures and crazes are welcome here! Apart fom a big queue for those getting there a bit after 11pm, this place is a quality night out...on the Sunday might I add.A very spacious but usually packed venue, boasting an event room with raised main stage, DJ booth and three bars dotted about the venue. Expect to see lots of the up and coming, famous or rookie fashion designers Jean Pierre Braganza and Giles Deacon i've seen. music and media crowds in here, quite youthful and hedonistic but all in all a good night out...on a Sunday I might add.",

It's surrounded by art galleries (notably White Cube), cafes and bars, and just round the corner from the clubs and Vietnamese restaurants on the lower part of Kingsland Road. The square itself is pleasant enough: a patch of grass hemmed in with railings, with a few nice trees. Sometimes you'll find an art installation there. On opening nights at the White Cube you might find a famous artist sipping a drink on the grass.",

It's really big and there is a nice diversity in what it offers - ranging from a more traditional restaurant - an outdoor restaurant - a front, middle and back bar - and a live music venue as well. The service however was very slow - albeit very friendly. There clearly wasn't enough staff working on the night. It was two deep right along the bar with only one person serving at one stage. Our food was also really slow coming out - and when it did it was over-priced, greasy and small. Hower on complaint they did give us a free bottle of wine. Not a bad venue but I really can't see what all the fuss is about.",

There are always dozens of people spilling out of the clubs and onto the pavement, and you might have to inhale a cloud of smoke as you make your way into an establishment, but the people are there to have fun and it shows. Pretty much all of the bars and clubs are worth trying out, and many don't charge a cover. There are also several restaurants, including a tapas bar, that make an excellent start to the evening. Some friends and I held a surprise birthday party for our friend Sue at Bleu, which turned out great. They cleared out the back of the bar, which held about twenty of us, for no charge.

He snickered and said my friends must have put it in there. yes....UNDER THE ICE. I gave him the side eye and asked him how they could have done that Houdini like trick. Bartender McDouchey rolled his eyes and walked away. So, not only did I have a napkin in my glass, possible USED ice, but I got disrespected like woah when clearly someone wasn't doing their job.

It's a cool venue to play though, especially on nights such as the one I've just described, but I still have the overwhelming urge to run off home immediately afterwards to avoid of getting stuck in a sticky, sweaty cage of human flesh. They let far too many people in to the gigs!",

It's essentially the East End's answer to the horror clubs of Picadilly circus.. you know... like Tiger Tiger (if you say Tiger three times the ghost of Jodie Marsh appears).Maybe at 3pm on Monday it's tolerable but on weeknights when you're forking out mucho quido for a beer, surrounded by ugly face men on the prowl for victims and the DJ is murdering some good songs in the name of 'mash-ups' then it is far from tolerable. Who has the cheek to open a yuckster place like this in lovely Hoxton and even go so far as employing bog trolls? No doubt some cynical money-making misanthrope. Shame on them.Nice comfy chairs and artwork nearly bless this place with two stars but the degeneracy of the clientele keep at one. Go back to SW1 you plebs!",

But once we journeyed inside, there was a whole world of cool waiting to be discovered and by cool, I mean, a mecca of adorable guys and beautiful chickies!! So this is where they all congregate!We decided to eat a little something to help balance out the cocktailin' we had been doing and for me that something was the burger. Definitely not a \"kill me now, I've officially had the best burger ever created by a human being on this planet\" good, but it was decent enough and did the trick. My cohort ordered some shrimp dish and it looked good too.But really, if you want to check out some hip eye candy, this is the place to do it. I don't think I've ever seen so many hot people in one room before! What are you waiting for!",

I couldn't decipher cool from the end of a cheeky ciggy and many times I was just frantically picking my destinations from a 1x1 Yelp photo, only to find out that the best looking pictures were often the worst establishments. I had heard about the \"coolness\" of Hoxton Square and because I have a knack for popping inflated egos, I went in with honest hopes of being able to announce from the rooftops that this establishment was overrated. Not in this case.Despite a less-than-amazing outside, the moment I walked into Hoxton Square Bar & Kitchen, I wanted to be there. Often. To be a regular. To have a booth permanently reserved for me. Hell, I would have moved in if our hottie server was included. I could literally feel the wave of cool brush by me each time the door opened and closed, and I had to mentally remind myself that mouth-open gawking is only acceptable in Disney movies, and even then a bit questionable. It was cool without trying, which made it ever so much more cool. The music, the people, the ambiance, the layout; the conditions were perfect. However, I did notice some scenester-esque clientele that could potentially ruin every that is great about this place. \u00a0That's the trouble with cool, it's only \"cool\" until it is.",

Unfortunately it gets stuffed up with skinny jean wearing, wonky hair strutting creeps from out of London trying to get down with the cool kids. The only thing going for it, is that it serves Sailor Jerry's Spiced rum, although I have to sell my grandma to afford it!Okay so I am really ripping into this place but I feel like someone should play devils advocate. There are so many other great places to drink in Shoreditch it seems a shame to waste your time here; this one has just past it's hey day and is suffering from a slight case of 'mutton dressed as lamb'. They do have some great bands playing here on the odd occasion and the back room where this happens is by far the best part of the place but that's about it. Even meeting Elijah Wood and shaking his hand here has not made me love it any more.The group owns several places dotted around London and this is by far the weakest effort they have put to the punters. But don't take my word for it, visit it late at night to sample the delights that lurk in the toilet of Hoxton.",

It was so strong, I immediately needed ginger ale to stretch it out. Although, in truth I'm not a drinker. So to someone more experienced it's probably just right. There is a variety of seating from a sofa area, single stools along a wall, to cafeteria table style seating towards the back. Typical bar fare is available at a reasonable price. There is a cloakroom as well. Oh, and they have. WIFI- SCORE! Just ask a bartender of the password. The area is right across from a park and sits along a square where there are other bars/restaurants. I can't wait to go back again. Hip Hop Karaoke was awesome!",

Good burgers and a very good Texan Chili con carne.During the day, it is a nice place to have breakfast or lunch, particularly when you find a place outside, with all the hoxton square buzz around you.",
