While its inexpensive but tasty fare is relatively similar to Alounak, a similar restaurant across the park in Bayswater, it is much more homely in atmosphere. The family-run place has some of the friendliest staff and amazingly succulent lamb skewers, and a meal there will rarely set you back more than 15 pounds. Definitely worth a try of you are local to Kensington or Earls Court. Then, you'll go again.",

Don't worry if you are not familiar with the cuisine, it has very subtle and wonderful flavors and a large variety to choose from.

With leftovers kindly doggy-bagged for lunch the next day. \u00a0I am fortunate to live very close by so this will definitely be a staple dining venue going forward.",

    "text": "Outstanding Persian Food by Delightful FamilyI come from a Persian family with a long tradition of discriminating taste when it comes to authentic Persian food. It was dinner time when we were exploring Kensington. Looking online for a place with GOOD FOOD brought us to this little family run restaurant. As I always do with Persian food, I came to the restaurant a bit uncertain about all the accolades by the reviewers. \u00a0But the restaurant lived up to its reputation and then some.Starting with Tahdig (rice crust) drenched with yummy Ghormeh Sabzi (aromatic mixed herb stew), I followed with their special lamb dish consisting of a skewer of tender, marinated lamb fillet kabobs and a skewer of minced lamb kabob over aromatic basmati rice. I washed down the delicious food with their homemade, thick and sharp Dough (yogurt drink, which requires an acquired taste) and finished with two cups of fresh brewed Persian tea. A perfectly satisfying authentic Persian dinner! \u00a0My partner opted for the Soltani kabob, which \u00a0includes a flattened version of the lamb chunks, equally tender and tasty. Despite the excellent food, the intimate atmosphere, and the fantastic fresh flat bread, we were most enchanted by the delightful family that runs the restaurant. \u00a0Most of all, we loved the gregarious and ever cheerful mom who clearly is the matriarch in charge.We will definitely come back again and will recommend Mohsen Restaurant to everyone we know.",

    "text": "I like the 5-star rating on Yelp - 'as good as it gets' is definitely appropriate for this restaurant since as far as Persian restaurants go, there is no better way to describe Mohsen. It's also one of the most affordable Persian restaurants in London, and therefore represents excellent value. A meal for two, with three starters, two mains, bread and a large bottle of sparkling water came to 42 pounds earlier tonight.I have been coming here for years and tried several other Persian restaurants in London. The rule with Persian cuisine seems to be that most reach a fairly good standard, but only one or two go beyond this level. Mohsen definitely fits the bill, and is the first place I take friends who want to try Persian cuisine.The starters are admittedly not first class, but tasty nonetheless (try the olivieh or kashkeh bademjan, my favorites) and go very well with the traditional, freshly prepared bread served here. As for the mains, stick to the Chelo Kebab, and go for either the koubideh (minced lamb), barg (strips of lamb fillet) or 'joojeh' without bones (chicken). The decor and atmosphere is very homely, so don't go here expecting a very chic experience. It's quite like eating in Mrs and Mr. Mohsen's living room, which adds to the familiar and warm feel of the place.",

Super moist and flavorFULL. I recommend this place to anyone that is in west London. The bread that they make in the front of the restaurant is so good. The variety of spreads are amazing. So good to eat with the breads and the meats. Portions are great. I recommend ordering the combo and sharing with someone else and also ordering the spreads. You'll get the best of all the flavors and dishes. I love that the food doesn't feel oily or heavy. Tastes fresh and homemade. Cash only.",

The kicker is this: \u00a0I order water, they offer bottled water. \u00a0They bring a plastic water, already openes, and the water tastes just like tap water: and they charges somewhere between 4-6 Britsh Pounds for it!.",

Great service here and they make you feel welcome. The mom even came to our table to say hi and ask how our meals were. The food is more than fairly priced compared to all the other restaurants here in London. The Persian food served here is authentic and wonderful. It's like going to your Persian buddy's family dinner. They make fresh naan in the front of the restaurant to order and it is wonderful with the hummus. I had the bone in chicken and my husband ordered lamb stew. So delicious. Will definitely come back here again. Oh, remember to bring cash as they don't accept credit cards.",

The menu was fairly straightforward. \u00a0Most of their plates offer lamb as the protein but each offering had a different cut of lamb albeit marinated/cooked in a similar fashion. I ordered Hummus, Naan, and Chelo Chenjeh. \u00a0Hummus was as expected but the Naan came to me different than others I have ordered in the past. \u00a0It was made fresh in a tandoor oven near the restaurant entrance. \u00a0It was thinner and more crispy than other naan breads I have eaten. Don't get me wrong. It was delicious but just found it interesting how differently it was prepared. \u00a0Anyway, for those who might not know, Chelo is traditional Persian rice and is cooked almost as if it was pasta as opposed to the traditional method used around the world and is served with a small portion of saffron rice on top. \u00a0The Chenjeh is lamb filet. \u00a0Food was excellent. Lamb was cooked to perfection and paired very well with the Chelo.",

It was well worth the drive!The owners entertained us all night and were so accommodating and sweet. Their food was absolutely amazing and service was even better. I highly recommend this restaurant and will go back whenever I return to London!",

Not being familiar with Persian food we had no idea what to order. The owner's wife was extremely gracious and helpful in describing the various menu items and made suggestions to ensure we ordered a variety of dishes that would complement each other.We were very happy with the food which had flavours we hadn't tasted before. The quality of the food was good, the service was impeccable and the the overall experience was great. They don't have a website so it's difficult to research the menu etc. but I highly recommend a visit, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "This is my favourite Persian place in the entire world... yes the WORLD. I travel alot for work and have sampled the persian cuisine on many continents. (Disclaimer: never actually in the middle east but none the less). This is by far the best and it happens to be within walking distance of my house! Yay for me.The food is very fresh and the service is wonderful. I've sampled many of the offerings here, and it's hard to choose what I think is best. The chicken kabobs are soft, tender and juicy. The stews are flavourful yet not overbearing. The bread cooked fresh and plentiful. Basically you can't go wrong at this place.My only gripe about this place is that it is cash only, which I always seem to forget. FYI There is a cash point at the Tesco down the road on Cromwell so make sure to stop by there on the way. Whether I am down the road or across the globe, whenever I am craving Persian food this is the place that comes to mind.",

They make their own homemade naan in front of the store. The chicken was super moist, but the best thing on the menu was the baby lamb chops. They give you butter to add to the rice as well. Very comfortable atmosphere with kind owners. If you're in the area, definitely give this place a try!",
