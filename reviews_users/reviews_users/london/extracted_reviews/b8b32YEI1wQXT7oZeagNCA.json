The place is deceptively large with some wonderfully intriguing decorations, with the odd hidden nook that had me thinking of Alice in Wonderland in a barn like rustic kind of way. The drinks offerings are great with draught and a decent wine list to back up the smart spirits selection. The Orange smacks of being a gastropub, with that decidedly West Side money, cool vibe. I liked the place and would definitely recommend.",

Bring back some hip old English traditions of the public house. Recomment the spiced salami, wild mushroom and artichoke pizza. Just delicious. Overall great quality food. Only problem is place too crowded these days!",

    "text": "A new and welcome addition to the not too sizzling area between Pimlico and Chelsea, The Orange is a pub/restaurant/B&B from the same property of the (lovely) Thomas Cubitt with a different kind of atmosphere from the posh pub a couple of blocks away.Here the tones are lighter and brighter, the atmosphere is generally warmer. The furniture has a sort of a country look, with clear, solid wood tables and chairs and waiters in aprons. The bar looks good (although I'm more interested in food), with the usual choice of beers and ales and a couple of interesting spirits on the back panel. They serve reasonably good cocktails (I could even order a Negroni with the bartender not looking scared at me), which is a plus.The food is reasonably good and reasonably priced. Except for the pizzas, which - although not at the appalling level of the likes of Pizza Express - are NGFI (Not Good For Italians): they're surely good enough for un-picky natives that don't horrify against an imperfect, slightly overcooked dough, cooked fennel on the sausages, sliced raw tomatoes mixed with the salsa, etc (I'll simply go back to Oliveto, not far from here, when I want a pizza nearby).Apart from the pizza, we were happy with the soup of the day, and found the wild boar + chestnut + chorizo stew pretty good despite the fact that there were no chestnuts in the mix (and they had been cheekily replaced by mushrooms).So, I realize I have mixed feelings: the ambiance is good, the location is very nice (the small square where The Orange is is one of my favourites in London and has the added bonus of being 5m from where I live), the food seems wisely sourced (in part from the farmers market that is kept every Saturday in the surroundings), the menu is interesting but... the quality must improve. And I'll be back to check that it actually happens.",

It's a perfectly reasonable pub - thought the clientele, with the exception of 1 rather disheveled and slightly drunk individual, looked a bit more financially secure than us lot. We enjoyed the booze, the company and the conversation, maybe not so much the prices. Probably on par for this area though. The place itself is quite large, with an interesting decor.The staff were a little slow, but did get to you eventually, even if it looked like there was nothing else for them to do.Can't comment on food, but if other reviews are true, I'd avoid paying high fares for poor fayre!",

It has a very local feel but the locals happen to be quite well heeled so there is an upmarket air to the drinks and food and hence the prices are higher than your regualr run of the mill local but they are not over the top and the quality is good.You are able to eat in the resturant or the bar and the food is delicious which a great choice from pizza's to Poussin.The choice if drinks also is vast there is a good wine list and also a small selectin of cocktails. Also the service is promt and friendly.Certianly worth wandering off the beaten track for the this cute little place.",

The pork roast is awesome (lots of crunchy crackling bits which were very tasty). The chocolate cherry cake is killer and if you happen to be at the restaurant at an off time, you might get the bonus spot in front of the fireplace! make reservations for the much nicer dining space (great windows/ atmosphere) upstairs.

Other good stuff: I didn't pick the wines so I don't actually know what the wine list looked like but the three wines we had (a St. Emilion, an Italian red and what I presume what a French white) were all good choices. Our hosts had arranged so that we were eating off a three-course set menu with four choices each for first and main course, and three choices for dessert. For the starter I had a country terrine that wasn't so nicely presented but tasted good. (My neighbor's tart with beetroot, figs, shallots and goat cheese more looked tasty.) My main course was the \"market fish\", which was a broiled salmon that was supposed to come with scallops except they were out of scallops. (They gave me the chance to change my mind when they realized this but I chose to go for it anyway.) The dish was nice, the fish was not overdone and came with tasty starch. Finally, my dessert was a little orange and almond cake with caramel ice cream, it was nice but a tad disappointing. The courses arrived rather slowly, perhaps to some extent due to the size of our group. The decor was nice but nothing special in my mind. A colleague lamented about the three-course menu as he was more interested in their regular menu, but at least he got the beer he wanted (Harveys from Sussex). Overall a solid three stars.",

The lighting is only just dim enough to cast a soft and romantic glow on the furniture and the restaurant's patrons.The menu ranges from \u00a39 small pizzas to meat mains in the \u00a315-20 range, with several sides costing \u00a34. The cocktail menu is extensive, but no more pricey than your average cocktail--the cheapest being around \u00a37 and the more expensive hovering around \u00a313. I had a sip of a basil and passionfruit concoction--pleasantly frosty, decisively well-made and finished adorably with half a passionfruit.The first thing that struck me was that the servers are aggressively and eagerly polite and helpful--I filled my glass with the bottle of still water sitting on the table and a male waiter walking by insisted on 'helping,' and finished filling my already half-full glass. I was appreciative, but I wasn't sure it was necessary.I ordered a small pizza with broccoli, red pesto, goat's cheese (available on gluten OR spelt crust!) with a side of sweet potato fries with a soft cheese--the pizza was thin and crispy and served with a bottle of chili oil. The fries were a bit on the soggy side, but nevertheless tasty and the cheese it was served with more than made up for the sogginess.Service was speedy, but on two occasions, our plates were whisked away while food was still on it--we had to ask them to leave them, as we were not finished eating. The only other aspect about dining here that I give warning about is that the water is not free--we were asked if we'd like another bottle, which we gratefully answered that we would--only to discover at the end of the meal that each bottle of still water was \u00a32!For three mains, three sides, and two cocktails(oh and the \u00a34 spent on still water) the bill came around to \u00a370 for the three of us. I definitely would return and definitely recommend the food.",

The food was good, not outstanding, but definitely okay. I was really glad I wasn't paying as I wasn't blown away and it is on the expensive side.Service was attentive and friendly.We hung around after dinner drinking wine on the pavement outside the pub. It's the London way - despite living here for quite some time now, I still don't get it? Maybe I'm lazy, but I'd prefer a seat to sit on to relax and enjoy my wine, rather than standing awkwardly outside with all the smokers sharing their poison with me (I'm an ex smoker myself, I'm not judging!)",

I was quite impressed by the look and feel of the place. Rustic, laid back, airy, very pleasant. However, that's where the positives end.We ordered a bunch of different items including 4 pizzas, a steak, beef ribs, a haloumi salad, polenta plus some apps. It took a full 45 minutes to get some of the food. The pizzas came out and we were told that the other dishes would be there in minutes. We were told that the kitchen was busy and that there was nothing they could do. A full one and a half hours after initially ordering, and lots of promises that the food was \"on its way\" the rest of the orders appeared. The flow and fun of the dining experience was totally ruined by their incompetence. The guys who ordered pizzas were already done and now the others had to just get started on their entrees.The service (waitstaff and the kitchen) was beyond slow the entire evening despite the place being no more than half full. I also have to say, the food quality was nothing special. From what our party said; the pizzas were average, the steak was good, the polenta was flavorless, the ribs were disappointing and overcooked, and the salad was mostly greens and not much else.After we finally finished, the waiter had the nerve to come out and ask if we wanted to order dessert. Sorry, we didn't have another hour and a half to wait for more mediocre food to come out.They gave us 15% off the check and also comped one of the meals, but still, it didn't make a horrible experience any better.",

We booked a table (you can only do this for the upstairs restaurant) and the staff were lovely, efficient and accommodating for the pram & baby.The menu is really varied (in a good way) and the service was great. The food excellent - would recommend their pizza bread as a starter - delicious. I also had the steak & mushroom pie which was yummy - not large portions though. Ok for me but big eaters might be a little disappointed - you can always order sides though.This place isn't cheap but the cost wasnt suprising given the menu/location/decor etc. We took our time and they didn't try to hurry us up or kick us out which always gets a big thumbs up in my book!Would highly recommend - get in early for downstairs or book for upstairs as it was certainly very popoular.",

The Orange was very accomodating, even when we arrived a bit late. We ordered plenty of wine and sat back with really excellent starters (my oysters were delightful and the presentation was excellent...I heard equally excellent things about the fried Squid), good-if-small-portions main (I had the fish of the day and risotto) and desserts...for some it was pretty pear tarts, for others it was an espresso martini (I don't think you even need two guesses to know which group I was in).It's priced at what a shabby chic gastropub in Victoria would cost...pricey but completely do-able on a budget. The wine is also a fair deal, \u00a34 for a large glass of Spanish wine (not the house). This may become our new haunt when we move offices to Victoria!",

It has been beautifully restored, as have this companies other restaurants, and has an upscale clientele to match it's upscale food and wine. The menu is seasonal and creative. I don't care what you order it will be of the highest quality and the presentation will be proper. The staff is well trained and ever so charming.This establishment is properly called The Orange Public House and Hotel. Alas they have only four rooms, but they are delightful in every way with four star amenities. If you are doing business in the area or just doing an architectural romp this is a place to consider.I have made this my locus for London when I yearn for a bit of Cubitt and the beautiful buildings he created.I headed for their ground floor bar which is informal and allows chairs and tables on Pimlico and then moved up to the second floor dining room with a more formal feel and a different menu; not pubgrub! Their roasted pigeon breast with cherry and dark chocolate jus, Jersey Royal Potatos with mint butter and a so delicate almond and orange cake spotted with pomegranate jam and clotted cream. My companion had pea soup, speck, orange and chervil mascarpone, Yellowfin tuna, samphire, smoked yoghurt and tomato and fennel ragout. That was followed by lemon posset with passion fruit jelly and mint meringues, all beautifully prepared and served.This is not at all complicated food preparation and it's high time South Florida took a look at this pub's menu and stopped with the over fried, greasy, frozen talapia, chix wings, and burgers for $15. When will they ever learn?",

The 2 story restaurant is covered in clean light coloured wood.Their pizza bread with chilies and olive oil is a highlight of my Sundays. I've had the beef rib and pork for roast both of which are recommended. There are also a wide selection of tasty looking pizzas, but being lactose intolerant I always stick to the roasts. The tend to run out of some of the roasts, so worth trying to snag a table on the earlier side (ie before 3pm) otherwise you might be stuck with chicken which would be a downer if beef is on your mind.The service is always slow, exceptionally slow sometimes. Just accept that, order more than a few Sunday funday beverages and you'll enjoy your meal.",

We had two fish dishes. \u00a0 Both well prepared, perfectly cooked with lots of flavor. \u00a0 The courgette side was also very nice with a slight spiciness. \u00a0 Service was excellent. \u00a0 As was the coconut cake dessert. \u00a0 Good selection of beers as well. \u00a0Thumbs up!",

    "text": "Coming here on a recommendation of my mum's (which sometimes I treat with a certain amount of trepidation), I was very pleasantly rewarded with my first ever visit.The decor and ambience here is definitely of the Gastro Pub ilk, but without a doubt The Orange does it with a superior style and panache. The atmosphere is light and airy, and this adds to a great vibe to take in while you munch.Some of the menu items change from time to time, so I will not list the individual dishes, but suffice to say they were all impressive and came with truly scrumptious sides.I am not normally a dessert type person, but I even succumbed to the amazing ice cream here. Everybody else ordered it and I said no. I was offered a taste. And I called the waiter back over immediately! Amazing!All in all an extremely solid performer in all areas. Well done to The Orange.",

What made it totally bearable however was how friendly the staff were about it. They immediately waved the bill and helped provide all the information to the police etc. Their reaction was so friendly it made me love the place.The entire place is very relaxing and nice. The indoor eating areas are so beautifully laid out, I loved it! Definitely go for it!",
