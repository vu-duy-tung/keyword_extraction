We shared the gyozas and a new prawn dish for starters, I had the Yasai Pad Thai for a main and it was delicious and my flatmate had the Salmon Teriyaki. He had the apple, celery and mint juice drink which was divine and I enjoyed the orange berry juice which also was lovely but i had drink envy after tasting his!! Would definitely return.",

I've been here quite a few times, and have always experienced this. The food is always really hot, and just like all the Wagamamas the choice of drink is one of the best features. The juices are very good, and refreshing. The location isn't amazing in terms of views/scenery, but it is handy. Its located in the Cabot Square shopping centre, so if you come up from Jubilee line exit, take a left before the escalators to enter the shopping centre and you will eventually find it on your right. One thing I must praise here is the service standards. You really spend very little time waiting for food to arrive. The orders are taken quickly and the food arrives within minutes. My favourite Wagamama!",

If you are hungry, want something fairly inexpensive you can come here (or to any of the wagamammas - it being a chain) and know you will get lots of great tasting food at a cheap price. What's more it also seems to be fairly healthy too. There is a wide choice, it often takes me ages to decide what to have, so much of it looks good, but a lot of it is quite spicy food so it may not be up everyones street. The layout is fairly basic, but quite nice. Everyone sits on long tables, so any kind of intimacy is out, you wont get away with private conversations here! However what it does mean is that you can get seated very quickly. Even when queues are long you never seem to have to wait for ages.Service is quick. You'll be in and out before you know it!",

The branch at Canary Wharf is pretty large. My coworkers and I came at 11:45AM and were seated right away. By 12:15PM, the restaurant was packed. There seems to be a lot but still a shortage of staff because the waiter who initially took our orders never came back. It was hard for us to track down a waiter, whether it was to order, have our waters refilled or getting the bill. I ordered a pad thai but was really confused with the flavors I was getting from this dish. The flavors were also pretty bland. We also shared a fried squid. This was alright. The flavors were there but the texture of the squid was quite rubbery. Overall, poor service and inauthentic food at Wagamama although conveniently located. I won't be voluntarily coming back again.",

I don't mean the hearty, crunchy kibble which, although I have not tried it, even if it were not that good would provide a satisfying 'crunch' to it, but I mean like the wet food out of the can. If you do, this place will likely be rather excellent for you as they create piles of mush that defies the laws of normal, human food. Had the 'soba noodles with salmon' and found out that they were not, in fact, soba noodles. I looked at the plates of garbage around me and found myself wondering why I had ended up in this situation? I would imagine if one had committed a rather egregious and violent crime in a nordic country, they would send you to a prison with much better food than this.Still - the people lined up. We are in a mall above a swamp so perhaps this is the logic? That said, there is the new crossrail area which does have good food - this place should be skipped. At all costs.

They are served in generous portions so it is worth the price as long as you are not looking for something fancy. Service is always quick and good here!",

Mom had the buri bowl which was actually quite nice with brown rice. Will try their yakisoba and chili squid next to see if it has better options",

    "text": "I have been to the Canary Wharf Wagamama a number of times and used to love it - quick service, massive portions, not bad value for money, free green tea. But then I decided to check the calorie content in their food and was shocked. According to their own website, they manage to pack an astonishing amount of calories into some fairly innocent looking foods. E.g. Grilled duck ramen (grilled meat in a soup, you'd think it would be decently healthy) is 990 calories, that's like two bigmacs. Most curries are over 1k calories. And don't tell me about the macros - these are not all good calories. So if you don't care about this kind of stuff - you will enjoy this place. If you do - order wisely.",
