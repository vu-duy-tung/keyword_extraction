Maybe the most expensive place I have been for a while and it is just a pub after all? They do food as well but this time we did not have the change to explore the menu, and frankly I doubt if that is ever going to happen.",

Inside it's quite bright and bedecked with fairy lights (I think on a bad day this might be too bright), and there's a couple of cosy sofas too. It's nice to see Tuborg on tap; I haven't seen it on tap anywhere else in London yet and they've got Budvar too. The roof terrace is excellent and I'm sure will be rammed come summertime, but has no heating (good for the environment I suppose). The terrace has also got its own upstairs bar, which nicely sidesteps the problem of pint spillage on the way back up the stairs. Good fun but not sure the atmosphere was that kicking. Well, it was a Tuesday night.",

This charming yet elegant little pub offers cosy couches, a step up from your standard pub range, and some excellent little half pint beer mugs for a bit of variety. We were quite entertaining by the glassware (Grant got a mini-beer mug, I got a mini-goblet) and that helped set the mood. What also helped was a large padded bench we could relax on to ease our tiring legs for a few minutes.The bar staff are warm and welcoming and fully embrace the monopoly pub crawl with open arms. The Castle used to give out a bespoke monopoly card but sadly they've run out. That being said, the cute barmaid was happy to sign the board with a smile so we'll take that instead. I like this place for a bit of a different drink and in this case we had some cider on tap to give a bit of an energy boost. The food some of the more regular patrons indulged in smelled delicious so it may be worth a stop and I can definitely see me whiling away some cold winter nights here if I didn't live so far away.",

Located between the ever busy Angel and King's Cross areas of Islington, the Castle offers up a pretty standard drinking experience for the area. There is not much to remember about the interior - sparsely decorated without a coherent single motif, and the Castle's claim to fame would definitely have to be the roof terrace (at least in the summer). I will say, the roof is really nice, even if it is a bit crowded. And it is worth a visit to this place just to enjoy the terrace on a cool summer evening. Many people had the right idea of relaxing in the sun with a pitcher of Pimm's. The beer selection is what sort of kills the Castle for me. The best draught that was available was Bitburger, and that is not really saying much. I spent my evening drinking Stella, which cost an absurd \u00a33,90 (especially when there are many other establishments in the area that sell Stella for \u00a32-\u00a33). All in all, nothing to write home about, but you should go enjoy the roof terrace, at least once.",

And there was a bloke with a barbecue. My stars go to those two aspects! However, the telly was depending on a shoddy aerial, didn't have any volume, and then they took it inside anyway. Pimm's was ridiculously overpriced and I had to wait for them to go to the cornershop to buy lemonade to make it with. Service was utterly lousy - ignorant.

    "text": "As Mr Sunshine reluctantly takes his hat off as we near the 2 week British summer, I have found a pub that provides a charming brown chap, such as myself, with all that he could ever want to pass a few hours with good food, drink and friends. The Castle, which a short stroll from Angel tube station, has become a traditional place to congregate on the Easter Sunday for a roast and a debaucherous afternoon of cider and shots of J\u00e4germeister. It is swiftly followed by an evening session of Lucky Voice (which I have also reviewed). \u00a0 The Castle is cool without even knowing it. It attracts a clientele that simply want to be able to relax and enjoy the surroundings and good company. There is a wealth of seating both hard backed chairs at wooden tables and a scattering of cushioned areas. My preferred location and one I would recommend is the table to the left of the bar as you walk in. It's a good vantage spot for friends to see you and for ease of access to the bar. For me there are two standout features. The food and the staff. I'm not going to lie, the food is a little pricey, but you do get some of the most delicious food this side of the channel. I can highly recommend the Roasts. One of these bad boys will set you back between \u00a311.50 and \u00a312.50 which when you see the size of the portions is great value. The roast beef is delicious and cooked to perfection. Drinks too can be a little spenny. I discovered 'Crabbies' on Sunday, which I drank until I could no longer walk and talk at the same time., but with that came a rather hefty bill at the end. Bottled drinks can be 4 nuggets and up, but they also have a great selection of spirits and \"Old Man Beers\", which will be slightly less. The staff are fantastic and whilst it did help that the Danish girl that served us on Sunday was easy on the eye, the rest of the staff were diligent and largely tolerant of the constant requests for more food and drink. Added to this there is also a roof terrace which is perfect for the sun worshipers amongst you. In the summer it can get busy, so make sure you get down there early to secure some seating and bask in the warm glow of the giant ball of gas.The only smack on the wrist is the fact that a. The gents toilet looks and is as cold as a refrigerator and b. It smells like... well, it smells odd. If you break the seal, you're in for a night of stinky shuttle runs. \u00a0Having said this though, it's not so bad when you compare it to the hellish nightmare that is festival toilets. Either way, hopefully see you there in the coming months you sexy kids.",

On the few occasions I joined them I was quite taken with the place and impressed by the cosy feel. Generally the bars in Angel tend to fall down one of two lines- ultra modern expensive wine bar or old man grotty pub- so it was quite nice to find a happy medium. Drinks in here don't come cheap though and a round for four easily set us back \u00a320 every time. The house wines were of a pretty good quality so I can understand paying a little more for them but \u00a34.10 for a Guinness seemed a bit steep. Even though I've only visited this pub in the Winter, I expect the best thing about it is its roof terrace. Even from downstairs it looks quite inviting and I expect it would make a great place to lounge about in the warmer months. Given the prices of the drinks, The Castle is not a place I'll be back to often but hopefully I'll still remember it when the weather warms up again.",

The roof garden is a great place to enjoy a smoke, including a cigar. Crowd is eclectic & and the music suits the crowd...",

After walking in around 8:15 and grabbing a table no one had come to give us menus or take our order for 45 minutes at which point we went to the bar to order food, only to be told the kitchen was closed. This place was secretly understaffed (one waitress for the bar and tables) and once a large group came in and ordered at the bar no one could take care of anyone at the tables. This place is probably better during the day with less customers and more staff. We didn't even get to try the food.",

I came with a larger group and our server was very friendly to us and allowed us to try certain items that were on tap before ordering them. He showed us an awesome New Zealand Apple/Passion Fruit cider, which was unlike the ciders you commonly find in the US.Since this was our last night in London, we wanted the cliche fish and chips - but to be honest it was one of the best preparations of it I've had. Enormous crispy filet of cod, with mushy peas and thick cut chips - a very nice meal washed down with some white beer. The proximity to our hotel and casual vibe made this place a winner in my book.Cheers.",

In fact this one seemed to not only have an identity of its own, but it also has a rooftop bar, and not one of those small ones designed for smokers to be able to get their fix without having to walk out the front, but an actually, proper, Australian style, rooftop bar (and it was even large enough to sit a decent number of people). The biggest problem that I had was not so much the pub, because as I mentioned it is actually a pretty cool pub, but the fact that I really didn't have a huge amount of time to spend here. Oh, the other thing that I though was really cool was that this pub really takes advantage of it being a monopoly board pub, especially with the huge painting of the Pentonville Road card in the rooms leading to the toilets out the back.",

    "text": "This was our first meal in London. We were so tired from all our traveling, just about anything would have tasted delicious.Atmosphere: A true standard pub. It was charming, cozy, and the bar was cute, but modern. It was however, super crowed and loud. We had to sit at the bar and wait for a booth to open up. There really wasn't much breathing room. When we were there the rooftop was under construction and it was off season, so we didn't get a chance to experience it, which seems to be a highlight in reading others reviews.Service/Staff: As mentioned above, we waited at the bar for a table to open. We did order our food at the bar because we were so hungry and didn't really want to wait. The bartender was very rude. I had some questions about what was in the food and he looked at me like I had five heads. Apparently in London, they don't get these types of questions. However, the time it took for our food to appear was reasonable. We had moved to a table at this point and they were kind enough to bring it over to us. Food: My boyfriend got the traditional fish and chips with mushy peas. He reports it as being good, but it is hard to compare because this, as it was his first fish and chips experience in London. The fish had crispy breading with flaky fish inside, fries were standard, and the mushy peas were unique and new experience. Portion wise, it was reasonable. Me, on the other hand, I got a Veggie Burger with fries and wasn't so impressed. It sounded really interesting, the burger itself was lightly breaded and it had a mint sauce with field greens as the lettuce. I dunno, the flavors were just off somehow. At least the bun was tasty. Oh, and I should mention the presentation was pretty cool. The burger came on a cutting board with the knife standing upright in the middle of the burger. The fries were in a wired metal cone, standing upright as well. I noticed they have taken the burger off the menu...Cost: Pricey. Don't go here if you are looking to eat (and/or drink) cheap. I don't think we will be returning. We were hoping to get a real pub experience but I don't think this quite met the standards. The food and drinks just aren't worth the price either. Would be cool to eat on the rooftop though.",

There was no chance of grabbing a table on the rooftop so we opted for a table on the ground floor. The bartender was a complete dick, pretending not to understand a damn thing we said. Our order was simple - one Hammerton N1 and one Hammerton N7. After pointing out where the bottles were located in the fridge, the bartender handed them to us and told us the staggering price of \u00a310.30.Having just been to an opening weekend at Hammerton Brewery and having paid only about \u00a34 for a pint at the brewery, I was shocked at the mark-up. \u00a35.10 for 330ml + it was served with complete attitude. No thanks.The icing on top of the cake was when I went to use the toilet prior to leaving The Castle. I was peacefully emptying my bladder when someone tried to knock down the toilet door, insisting that it was empty when in fact, it was not. I was in the toilet. The pounding and knocking continued for the duration of my time in the toilet which, might I add, was approximately 20 seconds.Rude staff. Rude patrons. Expensive beers.Won't be returning. Ever.",
