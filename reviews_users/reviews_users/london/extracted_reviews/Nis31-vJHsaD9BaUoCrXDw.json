Great for sharing -meze plates of houmous etc and very good Koftas, calamari with rose syrup dip, good falafel. There is a great outside area and a plethora of foliage to hide from the boss on a sunny weekday lunchtime. The grilled chicken salad is excellent and comes in at about \u00a36.Only minus side is that they keep changing the seating, so fingers crossed you'll get a comfy place to park!",

    "text": "I came here on a date. Lets just say my date seemed more interested in me than the staff. We were served by several manic depressive waiters. All apart from one lady seemed that had a pretentious smile but made an effort anyways as all the other waiters relied on her. They all seemed to hate their jobs! Not showing a smile, and not even asking which meal was for whom or naming the dishes. My dish seemed to be plonked on the table which startled the conversation flow on the date! Regarding the food:I had a starter of Dolma which had tender wine leaves but still crisp to the bite. With a comforting filling of rice, sultanas, and spices. It came served with a dainty chopped salad. My date had sucuk (sujuk) which had a little kick of spice. I then had the Iskendar, a dish consisting of chopped lamb, chopped bread, and submerged in a spicey red sauce with yogurt. To be honest I was a little disappointed as for some reason they decided to FRY the bread! Only adding to the calories.and not making the bread distinguishable. The presentation was nice however I had to find the bread buried underneath it all and even had to ask the water to aid me in this search. Deep fried it appeared almost as if it was a soggy over cooked potato. My date however chose a wonderful broadbean dish which had a very thin almost consume tomato dressing the beans with decorative thinly sliced beetroot and small potatoes. Very simplistic but sophisticated none the less. Regarding the drink:I opted for Ayran which is a yogurt based drink. It did need some salt or mint or even fizzy water to give it a kick. Otherwise it was basically watered down yogurt.Regarding the bread, yogurt, and olives:When sat down you are presented with bread, yogurt (which my date who is lactose intolerant thought was hummus..as it was covered in spices) and olives. They were fine and good to ease the stomach before a meal.TO CONCLUDE:Come here if you don't care for service.if you love vegetarian dishes as there are plenty to choose from. Also if you are not on a date!",

Hidden in the railway arches behind a wall of greenery, it was hard to choose between the deli, the bar and the restaurant arch. In the end we went for the restaurant, and had a lovely vegetarian mezze spread, with the house red, which was very drinkable. The desserts were good, and the choice was wider than in most Turkish restaurants. The service was impeccable. The waiters were friendly and attentive. I took one star away because the waiters have to scrape up the crumbs from the table with a little silver scraper thing between courses which was unnecessarily formal and made me feel uncomfortable.",

Searched the area for a lovely spot that I havent tried yet for something to eat with my parents and thanks to YELP found this little beauty down isabella street. Its like stepping into a little secret garden, with the greenery on the alleyway. The arches is gorgeous and the restaurant is decorated to compliment it.But onto the food. The menu was extensive including a delicious smattering of fish. We couldn't decide so we ordered quite a few starters and two main courses to share.We're a big fan of squid and there were many options including a delicious calarmari style dish with a sour rose sauce that was simply divine.I can't speak to having eaten a lot of Turkish food, but this place certainly seems to have an authenticity to it and a friendly set of staff that would certainly place this restaurant on the map for me to return to. Well worth a look if you're looking for something a little different.",

My boyfriend has talked about going here many times - the location is excellent, especially for outdoor dining in London. It's set back from the main road in this weird little garden like street which is adorable. We actually went there looking for a Thai place and ended up at this place when the Thai restaurant was closed. Since I had been told it was good, I was expecting a lot, and it was a complete disappointment.We had the set menu - for \u00a317.95 you get a bunch of starters and a main. Some of the starters were OK, but pretty standard. The wine we ordered was good, but not great - Rare Vinyards Pinot Noir. And then the mains came. Out of 4 of us we had: king prawns (read tiny shrimp in a sauce that was far too sweet and oily), lamb (read skinny little slices of lamb over mashed potatoes), chicken kebab (looked ok - didn't ask my brother how it was but very standard) and calamari which actually looked quite good.In the end, it just did not impress other than the location. I would not go back - you can get way better Turkish/Greek food in London, which does make me kind of sad as the location is great and so out of the way feeling. Oh well.",

    "text": "EV is Anatolian for home and that's a perfect description of this Turkish restaurant that serves up \"tastes of home\" each and every day. Located underneath the railroad tracks, the sweeping coved ceiling , the modern chairs, and the beautiful outside garden seating lets you know that whatever meal you are having here is going to be special. We were seated at the edge of the patio (more in than out) which was fine on the day we were there as the sun was having the same kind of day (more in than out!) We were presented with 3 menu options- the a la carte menu, the prix fixe menu or the specials of the day menu. Since our group was large and we wanted to taste a wide range of the menu- we went with the prix fixe menu where we all got to share a wide range of appetizers but could pick our own entrees. Dipping yogurt and bread were placed on the tables (watch that bread- it is addictive!) and then our first cold appetizers arrived. Too many to mention here by name but aubergine (eggplant), hummus, couscous and some white bean dish were my favorites. The hot appetizers were falafel and a warm spinach turnover. By this point- I really didn't need my entree but it was quite good. I had the lamb steak that was served with mashed potatoes and most of my colleagues had the chicken shish kabobs. All of the food was well seasoned and gave a nod to why this would be \"comfort food\". Too full for dessert- but the owner/manager came over with Turkish delight candies. Now I had had these before- but never so fresh and sweet (and I thought I didn't like Turkish delight!) Close to the Southwerk tube station, EV is a great choice for lunch or dinner alone- or with a group. After all- who doesn't need a little more \"home\" in their life?",

    "text": "It is nice to see more and more places popping up in this previously quite deserted area. \u00a0EV is perfect for a quick fix before or after a visit to the theatre or Tate Modern. \u00a0It's self-service with all mezze dishes on display behind a massive glass counter.I can't remember exactly how much they charged for a selection of four salad items, but the portions were very generous and good value. \u00a0Mind you I wasn't as impressed as I have been at TAS proper (they belong to the same group). \u00a0The tzatziki and grilled aubergines were rather bland. \u00a0I was impressed by the freshness of the parsley salad though and felt I was eating healthy food.EV is located under some railway arches and has the ambience of a generic self-service buffet restaurant - the type you get at National Trust properties. \u00a0It somewhat lacks in atmosphere, even though the turquoise chandeliers add a touch of class. \u00a0In summary: more of a quick lunch fix than a destination for a good night out.",

Last but not least, the food was solid. \u00a0We ordered two starters (prawns, squid) and two mains (I ordered steak with chips), all of which were tasty and fulfilling. \u00a0I particularly liked the seasonings on the steak; it was just the adequate Turkish twist to a classic steak dish.It's a good place to go after a hangout in the South Bank area.",

Isabella Street is such a cool place to come after work - loads of bars under the railway arches, all linked by some pretty outdoor trellis. A great atmosphere to have a nice cool glass of wine or cider on a summer evening after work.EV bar itself is a bit overpriced and a bit dark, but it's always quick to get to the bar since there are so many you can go to down this street. All in all, a great way to spend an evening :)Note to self, must try the food...",

    "text": "Ev Restaurant, The Archers - a quiet neighbourhood but as you take the turn and see the crowd, the place is alive. The Ev Restaurant is under the arches. The dining space at Ev is large with beautiful bricked walls. There were the few iconic Middle Eastern style hanging lamps - colourful. No other decoration was needed to give the place a personality.Throughout the festive season, ie. Christmas and New Year, corporate parties and friends getting together mean it is better to book and secure yourself a table. We turned up, without a reservation, but they very kindly gave us a table. Partly luck, partly I think it means more business for them. We were seated near to the entrance door which in a windy wintery night was not a good idea. It was either that or the opposite restaurant, which is also owned by Ev, but I heard the menu was slightly pricier.The place is very noisy. You have to shout to converse. Occasionally when the train passes above the place is drowned by the sound of the tracks. No one takes any notice and the chatter just continues, on a louder decibel range. Sadly for the musician, no one paid any attention to him and his music.The open kitchen captured my attention. It was only partially opened. There is a larger space at the back but from the customer front, one can see the bread making and the grills and the salad section. It is a relatively small space in proportion to the number of chefs working. The madness of cooking and serving performed like an organised chaos. It was very theatrical. Ev's menu was quite lengthy and I left it to the friend who is a regular and knows the cuisine well. I realised that a separate vegetarian option was available. We went for the set meze menu. The food was served the minute they took the menus away. Cold dishes were treated as starters. Bread was delicious. I somehow expected it when seeing the huge bread maker clay oven. The smell of freshly made bread is comforting. The hot food consisted mainly of deep-fried dishes. It was difficult to judge on one dish but overall, they all complimented each other very well; herby salad, tomato stew, garlicky houmous and crispy fried batter. It was all flavoursome and different textures making it more interesting to the palate.GBP 11.95 per personbaklava GBP 4.95 - was delicious. Imagine all those honey and sugar drizzles. This is surprisingly not too sweet. Delicious!Service was polite. With the restaurant running at full capacity, the waiters and waitresses still kept up with their charming attitude. I prefer not to have them hovering over us, filling our wine glasses and checking our food intake every five minutes. At Ev, we were left to our own time, talking and eating. Place was noisy with chatteres. Outside, people were still drinking. And this will probably continue towards early hours of the morning.",

The restaurant is basically located in a converted railway tunnel which adds to the charm.I selected the lunch menu. Despite the items being extrmely hard to pronounce I managed to order a starter and a main. The starter was a calamari rings in batter with a sweet chilli dressing followed by an adequate main of 4 chicken patties with bulgerwheat and salad. Very tasty, good portion and quality.This is definitely one to try again. The lamb shank looked good from what others ordered and I'll be trying that.",

Greeted quickly on arrival and efficient delivery to a table even when the place is buzzing and full, have had seats straight away.Proceedings start with fresh Turkish bread and garlic yoghurt dip brought to the table (straight away).Hummus is of the super smooth variety and very good too.I can recommend the chicken meatballs with aubergines and have also sampled the moussaka. Both were excellent and served as a complete meal. Portions are generous.The kitchen is open, the waiters are super efficient and attentive and it's a well run operation.Finally, the prices are good so the combination of quality food, service and pricing all makes for a great value proposition.

The food isn't outstanding but the two course \u00a39.95 menu is good value for fairly decent standard dishes like kalamar and chicken or beef patties. Bit overcooked here and there but generally ok. The menu is extensive so you would probably need to try a few things out to figure out what they do really well. The bread and yoghurt/oil dip which they serve as you're seated was great.It's a very big and busy place so service was quite slow - our drink order came after the food which just feels so wrong! Overall I'd recommend this if you're in the area and want something cheap (NB a la carte is more pricey) and reliable in a very pretty location.",

Perfect for sitting in, chilling alone or dine in with friends. I often have business meetings in there but it's also a great place to bring family with kids. Tucked away just behind Sourthwark tube, it is very accessible. On a sunny day, you can even sit outside in their garden at the front of the restaurant. It's a very popular place so be prepared to see a long queue. Don't worry though, queues move very quickly! They offer a fabulous selection of delicious Turkish meze as well as pastries, quiches and pizza. It's the place I keep coming back to for quality hummus, served with delicious and free bread. They have off the shelf non-high street produce to buy for presents too. Highly recommended!!",
