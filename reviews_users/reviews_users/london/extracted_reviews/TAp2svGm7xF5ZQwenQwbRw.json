    "text": "While visiting London, my husband and I made it a point to visit one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants. We went for a late dinner at Maze Grill. You should know that Maze Grill has essentially a steak menu - so I would not recommend it for vegetarians. My husband is Argentinian, and he knows his steak, so it was perfect for him.The menu has a selection of various cuts of steak from various regions in the UK, US and Japan. It was a tough decision to select the cuts of meat - I wanted to try them all to taste the difference. It would have been great to have tasting platter of the various steaks, so I would suggest going with group instead to get the variety. \u00a0The steaks were cooked to perfection, however my husband believed the portions could have been larger. Service could have been better, but as we were probably the last seating before kitchen close, I'm assuming everyone was ramping down. We just missed a sighting of Chef Ramsay by a couple of days. \u00a0Overall, it was a great experience and I would go back again.",

We sat on the raised seating, and went for the chefs menu which was made up from 7 courses, which for a tasting menu was very adequately portioned! All the portions are served at tasting menu size which is quite different. The food when it came was amazing, and just the right mixture of modern, fine tasty food. They also offer wine flights, which consist of 3 complimentary wines served at once on a little wine holder tree (i'm not sure there is a word to describe this) which is a very fancy idea. The staff were all really clever at knowing their stuff & friendly. the excution of serving seemed ever so efficient. I loved the atmoshphere in this place, and we could see into the kitchen through a huge glass window which is great for someone as nosey as me! It all seemed very relaxed front of house, but can be sure that kitchen looked like no fun was being had!!",

However small the food may be, the flavour makes up for it in abundance Some favourites:-Duraude with lobster risotto-Pumpkin latte with duck-Quail Wine list by the glass was very good.

Well, I do admire to extremely large variety and types of cuts you can get at this place. Red meat made to melt in your mouth at a wonderful medium-rare. Perfect each time we have gone. But.. I just don't think I can justify, even though I have, buying a \u00a0NY steak for 140 US dollars. It was wonderful, bliss, don't get me wrong; but when I had the cheaper Rib-eye steak, I have to say the price difference really could not be found. All in all, best steak house I've ever been too! This will always be a place we will visit each time we're in town. Expect perfection here because it will be found.",

The service, as you would expect from a Gordon Ramsay establishment was impeccible. I counted 5 seconds between my wine glass emptying to it being refilled again. Due to the special occasion we were offered to be shown around the kitchen and watch the slick work being done by the friendly kitchen staff. Highly recommended for a special occasion.",

    "text": "A few weekends back, my sister and I had lunch at Maze with our cousin and her husband, with their 1-yr old baby and her mother-in-law. They had finished their 2 year secondment in Oxford, and were returning to Melbourne, so we decided to have a celebratory farewell lunch. Maze were very accommodating, and they had a high-chair for the baby. Staff were very helpful, polite and attentive. Service was impeccable, and the best I've seen at restaurants so far. Plates and cutlery were changed after each course, which is impressive, considering that they use silver cutlery, which has that lovely metallic tinge. We also had a bottle of San Cerre, and this is the first place I've seen that decants white wine. Bread was replenished regularly throughout the meal, and although they only served two types of bread in a metal cup, they were tasty. One was an elongated finger-shaped soft bread lightly sprinkled with salt, and the other was a slightly harder oval-shaped roll. For the meal, I had the (1) Orkney scallops with Pink Fir potatoes, cauliflower and summer truffles; (2) Quail with kohlrabi, cauliflower, and a burnt onion reduction; (3) Roasted Muntjac deer with pine nut pur\u00e9e, baby beets, oats, seeds and juniper; and (4) Peanut butter and cherry jam sandwich, tonka bean cream and dehydrated cherries.I chose the scallops because I'd seen them on the website, and wanted to try them. I also love peanut butter, and was curious to see how it could be used in fine dining. The scallops were served on a nice glass plate, 3 lovely scallops on a bed of pureed cauliflower, with slices of potatoe and shavings of truffle. The flavours weren't overpowering, and allowed the flavour of the scallops shine through. The scallops were firm but not rubbery or overcooked. A very enjoyable dish.The quail was very delicate, and the cauliflower was crumbled into something that resembled cous-cous. I wasn't exactly bowled over by this dish, and would consider it just average. Nothing to shout about.The Muntjac deer was a clear winner. The meat was a deliciously medium pink, served with a lovely thick, flavourful puree. The oats and seeds in the puree added a nice crunchy texture and a nutty flavour, which I felt complemented the deer excellently. The beets provided a lovely tangy contrast to the meat. Putting a bit of everything on a fork, made the flavours dance across my tongue and all over my mouth. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. It was very rich, so although the portion looked small, it was quite filling (maybe because this was already my 3rd dish).To finish off, the peanut butter and cherry jam sandwich I had was divine. About 2.5 to 3 inches of lovely smooth creamy peanut butter mousse in a cylindrical shape was sandwiched between two round discs created from caramelised sugar. A thick cherry jam/liquid was then poured over this sandwich. There was also a nice dollop of tonka bean cream, but I was just focused on the peanut butter. It had plenty of peanut butter flavour, and the rich creamy taste was well balanced with the acidic cherry jam. The caramelised sugar discs provided a nice crunch. I was glad I chose this and will definitely be coming back again just to have this dessert.We then had coffees, and they served a little platter of petit fours with the coffee. A nice way to finish off the meal. Not cheap, but as a treat, it was a fantastic experience, and one I thoroughly enjoyed. It's less formal than Gordon's other restaurants, and has a more relaxed atmosphere, which allows diners to enjoy their food, instead of worrying about formalities.",

And it was delicious, perfectly cooked, deliciously tender (for rump) I'd definitely have it again.And then things went slightly awry... \u00a0The service which had been excellent up until this point somehow evaporated and we were left waiting over 30 minutes for our (admittedly still delicious) desert, Gordon would not have been happy and neither was I, defintely lost a star there Maze Grill...",

    "text": "Ah yes, Gordon Ramsay's. It is not my custom to dine in establishments of this kind, so I couldn't really say how this one compares to other top class restaurants. For me it was more a question of \u00a0is it worth it spending 70-80 quid on a meal? (that's the minimum amount you can expect to spend per person if you come here in the evening, unless you're not having any wine, but why on earth would you do that to yourself.) My answer to that question is a firm yes. We should all indulge in some Michelin-starred food now and then. Don't waste your time on those restaurants in the medium price range, eat cheap, save up and go to Gordon Ramsays! It's not only about the food - which of course, it has to be said, is exquisite (Maze specialises in delicate tasting-sized dishes, each dish is like a little piece of art) - it's about the whole experience. The restaurant itself is exceptionally stylish and elegant - modern, with lots of shiny surfaces, yet friendly and inviting - and the service is just fantastic. The waiters are many and extremely attentive (they keep filling up your wine glass almost after every sip you take), and whether you eat here every week or once in a blue moon they do their best to make it a special occasion for you. No snobbery in sight. Hmmmm, might come here for lunch sometime. There's a set menu, either about 30 quid for four courses or 40 for 6. Almost cheap! Well, maybe not. But now I'm hooked!",

    "text": "I wished for so much more. This review will likely need to be discounted due to the odd nature of the meal and the general bizarreness of the evening. To start, we had a private room for 25, so that's a bit unusual for your average diner, and got something that looked like an 8 course prix fixe for everyone attending. The second point to note is that weirdly, before we'd started the power in the restaurant went out, it came back on eventually, but it was auspicious.I'll do this somewhat in reverse in terms of themes, but it may be helpful to have an idea how my evening at maze worked chronologically. Opens with going to the lobby, being led through the main restaurant through the hotel lobby to our private room, realize there's 3 out of 25 of us with everyone else likely late or at the bar we trek back the way we came past the restaurant lobby to the bar, we are at the bar for some light drinking then trek back to our room for more light drinking followed by a seated meal.D\u00e9cor - the main dining space is much nicer looking than the GR website makes it look (in my opinion). Its not so brightly lit and doesn't come off so airport lounge-y as I was expecting. The bar area is similarly attired but is an awkward space with strange seating patterns and no great area to stand with drinks and mill around. The private room, looked marginally nicer than a small hotel conference room (which is likely its other function, this is in a hotel after all) due to the wine refrigerators, but the subterranean space couple with odd windows and a lack of notable d\u00e9cor made it feel less than poshService - generally excellent during the meal service. This is to be expected considering the vast sums of money our benefactors were bestowing on the GR empire so that doesn't really more the needle much. One thing that did irk me was when at the bar, enough of our party arrived where we though we ought to adjourn into our dining chamber. So we're still in the middle of our drinks and we start to move through the route necessary to locate us in our room and our waitress halts us telling us we cannot leave the bar area with our cups, our drinks must be finished before we depart. Now I understand this is a big-ish restaurant, or at least big enough to have separate rooms for bar and dining as opposed to being 2 parts of the same room, but we noted to our waitress that we had a private room, so clearly she knows we're dropping serious coin and she felt it still necessary to take this take. Not hugely annoying, but kindof tacky and for the prices, honestly absurd upon sober reasoning.Food - between the pre-dinner drinks at the bar, the champagne pre-dinner, and the wine, the food was a bit of a blur. I will say I found it clever, well paced and flavorful. The downside is, maybe its too much wine to the head, but it wasn't that memorable. The one thing that stuck out to me was a mushroom veloute, I'm not generally a fan of mushroom soups, but this was exquisite. The rest, sigh, not particularly notableOverall - its tough to get a proper read on the place, considering I didn't order anything on my own, I didn't pay for anything, and it was an overall unusual dining experience, but hopefully this stands as a useful note to anyone else who finds themselves in a position to pick a big group dinner",

    "text": "Been to Both Maze and Maze Grill on several Occasions, The Food in both is consistently not just perfect but amazing.I will review both in this as people seem to be mixing the 2 restaurants on qype, I will start with Maze, the Marinated beetroot, Sairass cheese, is not what i would have normally ordered but was recommended by staff at Ramsay's gastronomic pub 'The Narrow' (see my other review) and was an out of this world dish. Other favourites include, Daurade with squid Bolognese, chorizo, garlic and lemon pur\u00e9eCornish lamb rack and shoulder, English garden mint gel Rump of veal, tasting of artichokes, leek and truffleIn fact every dish is simply a discovery into the joys of food. The Staff here are above professional and at the same time friendly, The Wine and champagne list is superb and for that special occasion (or everyday occasion ) You will be hard pushed to find Cristal 2002 at a Restaurant in London for their amazing price of a little over \u00a3200 let alone in a Michelin Starred restaurant of this calibre! Out the door pass Reception and you will find yourself in Maze Grill a great place for those who appreciate a good steak, If you are amongst the blind that think that Gaucho's serve a good steak then Maze Grill is an education on steaks, What have I got against Gaucho yes they know how to cook a steak i will give them that but unfortunately what they are cooking is 'Finest Argentinean Steak' the only problem with that is their is nothing that fine about Argentinean Cattle it is tasteless at best, Yes i have been to several and having tried the sampler which is all 5 cuts none have come close to impressing me, But back to Maze grill as all that should be for another review and what you find is the finest breeds from the Uk and around the world, We have some of the tastiest Steak on our doorstep(with few exceptions like Kobe more later) so why eat a cow that Diego Maradona has kicked over from Argentina, Breeds include Casterbridge grain fed, Hereford grass fed, Aberdeen Angus, and for those who want to go further a field Creekstone prime U.S.D.A. corn fed, aged 35 days as well as Wagyu(Yes From Cows that are massaged played music too etc) Prices are all very reasonable the price of Wagyu may shock some at around \u00a3100 but you will not find 9th grade any cheaper anywhere I know. Not the Largest steaks in the World but if you are often compared to a pig like me then even 2 of the normal breeds would not break the bank and is nice to compare tastes. All the sides and fish are also amongst the best and deserts are amazing too.This and Hawksmoor are the only 2 places in London i would recommend to meat lovers, Of course if in New York Or Las Vegas(know there are a few more in the U.S but have only been to these too ) there is Del frescos but that is a whole other story. Maze and Maze Grill get into my top 5 every time.",

It is about \u00a365.00 per person without drinks. First of, I don't think everyone love quail :( some of the colleague didn't event touch the bird. \u00a0The top part of the short rib was so hard to chew and has lotsa fats. Yiew...

I was sold with the soup.....amazing taste, layers upon layers of flavor, beautiful presentation and excellent service. It's difficult to describe such complex flavors but let's just say the chef was a genius!Surprisingly casual, unpretentious and comfortable. One of the best meals I have ever had. My foodie friend agreed with foodie orgasmic delight. Very pricey. We both had a pre-meal cocktail, the four courses with wine, cappuccino and a grappa. Amazing!",

But no no, I was wrong. Maze has proven me wrong. Selling point #1: iPad wine menu. *ching ching ching* Immediate win in my books and mucho puntos for you Gordon. Selling point #2: Great service from a cute server with great stories. Our server was so entertaining, telling us stories of when Gordon comes to the restaurant and how he is exactly as he is on TV. Nod your head, say Yes Chef, do not talk back to Gordon!Selling point #3: Actual great food. I do love the tapas style menu, small tasting portions so you get to try a larger variety. What stood out to me was: yellow fin tuna, squab pigeon foie gras, halibut, duck breast and...... the lemon refresher & tart. Love love love the smell of lemon. Although, I did thought the basket of lemon was somehow the dessert. It was soaked in liquid nitrogen so it gives off the smoke.... but it's just for the smell and you eat the tart that comes along with it. A bit gimmicky but i love it. For the price and service, oh so worth it. Well done Gordon. Well done.",

Great flavor in the filling and nice delicate noodle wrappingVenison with risotto and butternut squash- it was cooked to perfect at a medium rare to rare temperature.

    "text": "The restaurant and bar are very attractively appointed and quite busy on a Saturday night. Our party of 6 was seated after having a drink in the bar. Perhaps about 15 minutes after our reservation time. Not bad for a popular place on a Saturday night. Our party ordered two bottles of wine one in the $250 range. The other was about $800. It was difficult to find to similarly priced bottles. The wine list was not the best. We hadn't expected to order in the higher range. The list was very different from the one published on the website. Our first course of fried calamari was inedible. It was so rubbery it couldn't chewed. They replaced it but the second try wasn't much better. The roasted pumpkin soup was much too salty and not hot just warm. The Maze sushi was much better the fish was very fresh but the rice didn't hold together when picked up with chopsticks. Everyone enjoyed the steaks they ordered. All were cooked as ordered. The sides were fine. I ordered the whole sea bass which was cooked well. I needed to filet my own which I Expected but I would expect a Gordon Ramsey restaurant to provide the appropriate knife for the job not the huge place knife I was given. The fennel orange salad was very large pieces of butter or iceberg lettuce dressed with very old tasting oil. No sign of fennel or orange and a giant mess on the plate. Because Gordon Ramsey is such a presence on TV and such a stickler for perfection I expected more, especially at this price. We were not in a pub.Deserts were fine with a decent presentation. Unfortunately we wouldn't rush back.",

Grilled to perfection, that was one handsome piece of steak! Dessert was so-so, it was pretty hard to be impressed with anything else after that beef. The only cravat was that service that day was a little rude, I don't think they approved of us going family style and moving the plates around. Otherwise, gold claps all around.",

Long after our food was due we were told it would be right out. 20 minutes later and almost an hour from our first course our dinner arrived. \u00a0- for the wait we were offered a tour of the kitchen. This sounded great. \u00a0At the end of the meal, excited for the tour, we were told that instead the chef had signed menus for us. \u00a0I really had no need for a menu signed by a chef that prepared our okay dinner- mediocre wine list. \u00a0Yes they have the big names, Opus One, the big name grand crus, etc, but we expected a broader list for the restaurant. - we were on the main floor. There is a level above this floor that looks over to this area. \u00a0We felt a bit creeped out by the staff just standing and watching from overhead.- when we made our reservation online it said that for our time slot there was a four course menu. It's partially why we booked the time we did. \u00a0When we arrived we were told this was offered earlier, and not at our time slot. As a side note, the menu displayed outside has more offerings than the actual menu. Some pluses: - some of the entrees were okay (asparagus salad), but some were very, very good (scallops) - this is why I gave it 2 stars. - staff was very nice and dressed well- we were seated promptly- our drinks were full w/out asking- they had Reidel glassware, including the appropriate glasses for our Bordeaux. \u00a0We will not go back here, and likely not to another Ramsay establishment, though understand others love this place. \u00a0Hope you have better luck than us!",

Perfect amount of crackling on top and nice tender meat. My last savoury dish was Duck Leg with wild mushrooms and romanesco which was perfectly cooked and had fantastic flavour. For desert I went for the chocolate and peanut bar with ice cream. The most delicious desert I've had in a while.

    "text": "I have to say from the get go.... Please don't see my three stars as negative and I will explain why.... Maze proudly wearing the name of Gordon Ramsay is a good restaurant and worth experiencing. Maze offers a touch of London fine dining and service. The staff are all delightful, \u00a0friendly, \u00a0helpful and professional. The chefs offer a great culinary experience with exciting flavors and twists.... But is it worth an M star? In my opinion... noRosettes yes definately... Maze felt more like an upmarket brand than a unique experience the Michelin movement commands. My girlfriend and I signed up for the seven course tasting menu, \u00a0with a few drinks (2) the bill weighed in at a couple hundred quid.... Did I feel like I received the enjoyment Maze should offer for in its price bracket?.... Yes and No. Worth a visit yes, \u00a0will I go back.... No. The feel of the restaurant, \u00a0lacking linen on tables and scratched plates (bad lighting) made the restaurant feel like an upmarket slightly tired Cafe. Good for a business lunch or casual meal but not much more. The wine selection was extensive and well thought through so full marks there. Also we were aloud to swap a dish on the tasting menu after the chef was asked which was really appreciated. Our tasting menu averaged 25 mins between courses, which is unacceptable for a 7 course tasting \u00a0menu, we were glad to leave after being in the restuarant for 2.5 hours. The food was interesting but not innovative, the restaurant was very very noisy and felt cluttered...... Something is missing.... Gordon maybe?? His name is on the door and I'm sure so is his influence... The venue lacked.... plain and simple. I recommend to go and experience \"GRs\" restaurant Maze... But maybe the head chef should put his name on the door... And unless you have three hours + to spend in a restaurant don't get the tasting menu, go for lunch... \u00a0order what catches your eye, \u00a0have a glass of top shelf wine and have a good time, but don't expect a Michelin star experience.",

It's one of Gordon Ramays least fancy restaurants and the focus is all about grill - as it says in the name.The Wine ordering is done on iPads so you're always see the current price and which wines that are available i glass, and not just as bottle, just that moment.Then they bring you all the several meat choices and talk about the difference before you order.The meat it self is all of the highest standard and it's grilled to perfection. Just amazing.",

    "text": "You would think you get what you pay for but not in the case of Maze. I was excited to be able to try a Gordon Ramsey restaurant and see for myself the standard of perfection he demands of all his employees. I guess while the boss is away the employees will play. Service was just plain awful. We were seated promptly and given menus. The waiter came and asked us what wine we wanted. I was confused because there was no wine list in sight, was I supposed to just guess what was available? When I asked if there was a wine list the waiter disappeared and reappeared to shove an iPad in my face and walked away. No explanations.The sommelier. came by to help us with selecting a wine but he was quite pushy with wanting us to buy bottles. I'm not a big drinker and will usually only have a glass of wine. I could almost feel him mentally dismissing us when we started looking at glasses of wine. \u00a0While I came to Maze partially for the experience I was most excited for the food. The food was just okay, I've had much better for a 1/4 of the price and double the portion size. We were given amuze bouches which were a nice touch and some crackers with bean puree which was tasty. Each course could be eaten in 3 bites which may be forgivable since there were many courses. What wasn't forgivable was the pacing of the course. The wait between each course was about 20 minutes. Add on another 10 minutes just so someone can come and change your silverware. There was a silverware change between every single course. That's about a hour waiting just for silverware changes! Between every course we were just sitting there and while we enjoyed each others company it was getting very frustrating. When the manager asked us at the end of the meal if we enjoyed ourselves we told him honestly that we felt the pacing could have been better. We weren't looking for an apology or anything but we were shocked & insulted when he just looked at us an asked \"Well, have you ever been to a restaurant of this caliber?\". To answer your question sir: No, I have not, your restaurant is in a class all it's own. I have, however, been to restaurants with more stars and higher prices and also hole \u00a0in the wall restaurants with better service and spectacular food. TLDR: Poor service, average food, no bang for your buck. Instead you get sass for your cash.",

    "text": "In general, pretty happy with Maze; great food, great service overall. Went there for a business lunch, conveniently located close to our offices in Mayfair. We went 'a la carte', and ordered 7 dishes for the 2 of us, which was PLENTY.We started off with the 'Marinated yellow fin tuna, compressed apple, coriander, horseradish, ponzu sauce'. This was my least favourite dish... still, perfectly seared but nothing super special. Maybe too delicate for my pallet?The dashi braised octopus, heirloom tomatoes, rocket, ginger and soy dressing was super lovely.... the dashi is nicely umami, and the octopus has a beautiful crunch, the tomatoes taste fresh, and feel unworldly; best way I can describe it, sorry, it kind of left me speechless.The red mullet, crispy squid, garlic and lemon pur\u00e9e was also very good, and there was a nice playfulness between the mullet and the squid; great combination.The scottish hand - dived scallops, smoked bacon, black quinoa, broccoli and lemon was a highlight for me. The scallops were perfectly shallow fried, and it was a beautiful dish to look at; A+ for presentation, and A+ for taste. The dumpling of lobster, tiger prawns and salmon in aromatic lemongrass broth was an excellent choice, very delicate, but for 14\u00a3, I would have wanted more than 3...We had the Brill, brown shrimps, salsify, ginger,jalapeno and miso dressing; although the fish was perfectly cooked, and lovely, the shrimps were meh; the miso dressing was fantastic!The epic part of the meal was the braised beef feather blade, pomme pur\u00e9e, shimiji mushrooms, togarashi spice; the beef was soooo tender ! And the pomme puree was perfectly dense.We ended the meal with lemon tart, toasted meringue, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche sorbet,lemon sherbet. This dish is foreshadowed by a stunning teaser of lemon in nitrogen... the meringue is surprising... laid very flat, super delicate, and great taste. Perfect zing. Went down fast.The entire meal was supported by a bottle of Sancerre: Sancerre \"Vignes Blanches\", Henri Bourgeois 2011 for \u00a345.00; crisp, fresh, and a beautiful wine to accompany our mostly sea food/fish centric selection.All in all, MAZE is a great place to take clients. Would I take someone there on a date? Probably not, there are funner, cooler places to have a social 1:1 (Texture, Dabbous), but for business and good food, this place rocks it.",

Relaxing environment. The complementry bread was really good and the food fantastic. They are small tasters of the signature dishes. The wine list is presented on an ipad for you to browse through. Great idea but be carefull, the drinks will beef up your bill. \u00a0Service was very quick up until the 2nd course then we were left waiting around 30mins for the 3rd course...didn't bother us but the website did say that this offer was for those who were lunching in a hurry.....Overall, a great deal, grab it while you can!Also, I see the food catagory says American, the restaurant is actually French/Asian Cuisine. The grill next door is more American.",

Course 1: duck & foie gras terrine, cherries, wet almonds, Sautemes gel. Delicious!!!!! It paired well with the Ros\u00e9 the sommelier recommended. Course 2: crispy chicken thigh, charred baby gem, turnip, lettuce mayonnaise. I loved the tenderness of the chicken & the crispy skin. It paired well with a sauvignon blanc.Course 3: braised beef feather blade, pomme pur\u00e9e, shimiji mushrooms, togarashi spice. Super tender. I hear they braised it for about 10 hours! Course 4: frozen banana, milk ice cream, banoffee caramel. A great way the end the meal. It was the perfect amount of sweetness. I also had a taste of the pork belly, razor clams, wasabi, crushed peas & the yuzu tea cake, mango & lime jam, lemongrass ice cream. The pork belly portion was huge! The skin was nice & crispy. I wished I had a choice to pick a 5th course! Pork belly is a must next time. The tea cake was light & reminded me of a moonpie. Overall I really had a good experience at the Maze. The service & staff were superb. I highly recommend coming here regardless if you get the summer deal or not. Make reservations!",

The Cornish lamb was outstanding, as was the incredible chocolate delice. Ambience wise it's pretty suit-y and businessy, at least on a week night and I would say it was grown up, smart and comfortable rather than warm or intimate. Service was well drilled and discrete but not enormously charismatic - but certainly good enough. The wine list was intimidatingly pricey but the sommelier picked us very good Pinot noir and riesling to a more reasonable budget. All in, a fantastic spot for hosting and enjoying fine food.",

    "text": "First, I must clarify that this review is for dining at Maze Grill and drinks at Maze. After watching what seems like hundreds of episodes of Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares I was expecting everything to be even better than perfect although I was secretly hoping something would fall short. And although overall it was a great evening, a couple of things did fall short. I should have been delighted, but instead I felt a little jipped. The prices were pretty outrageous--about \u00a3100 a person. I'm accustomed to getting what I pay for and I'm not sure we really got what we paid for. The food was delicious and the wine was super. If you are a meat eater who particularly loves steak, you'll surely enjoy this spot. The meat was cooked perfectly and was so tender. I'm not a steak connoisseur, but I was with three boys who are and they were just dying in their chairs, making sure not to miss one scrap. They even had a cut of steak on the menu for \u00a390... we didn't order that one, but since, I have wondered what makes it so special? They have an interesting way of doing starters. You can either order a traditional starter or you can share a bunch of small plates. Since small plates happen to be one of my all time favourite ways to dine, this pleased me to no end. We ordered all 7 that were on the menu and each was quite tastey. Some were better than others, but the one that would make me go back was the soft shell crab with spicy mayo. I could have been happy just having that and a glass of wine. The service was just okay for such a swanky place. They recommended way too many side orders for the table and a lot of food went to waste--in my book, it's really bad taste to waste--maybe it's a tactic to add just a few more \u00a3s onto your total bill. There were a couple sauces and dishes missed so we had to remind the waitress they were missing--poor form! And the man who was supposed to be the beef expert came to our table to tell us things \"this is the Hereford beef. It is from Hereford.\" Like I didn't know that already... more time I will never get back! At the end of the evening they were kind enough to book us a table in the bar area--well, again maybe it was just a way to squeeze a few more \u00a3s out of our pockets. But it's a nice to be able to digest your food sitting down and in a well mannered bar before heading home.",

    "text": "Well I'm glad I wasn't paying, that's all I'll say.Oh ok I'll carry on for anyone interested.Went to maze for the first time after work with client and workmates. Got the chefs table which was nice. Slightly closed off and right by the kitchen so you see all the action.It's a very buzzy place which is kind of seductive too. So all good.Then the food came. It was a set menu for the table. Lots of starters. Crab cakes, deep fried szechuan ribs, risotto balls, chorizo, you get the picture. Lots of good old finger food to go with lots of beer and lots of chat. Only bad thing was that all of it was of a pretty poor standard. The risotto balls were heavy and doughy and felt like they had been hanging round for hours. The ribs were totally dry and overcooked and why they were covered in batter lord only knows. I think they were called Szechuan because there were a couple of slivers of onion and green pepper. Crab cakes, dry again. It felt suspiciously like everything had been made a dy or two before and cooked within an inch of it's life. The chorizo was tasty though.Next course was a choice of steak or chicken from the grill. My steak was not bad by any means but didn't delight like one at the hawksmoor might. And the chicken was again thoroughly overcooked. Puddings were piled high but lacked finesse.I dunno, maybe this isn't a finesse kind of place. But for the cash you expect something a lot better in terms of execution. Mr Ramsey hoisted by his own petard. We all imagined him coming in, kitchen nightmares stylee, taking one look at the ribs and saying \"fuck me, fucking hell this is a shitfest. No authenticity, no passion from the kitchen, this place is going down the drain fast and no fucking mistake.\" unlucky Gordon. This place is one of yours!And on a smaller point, there was far far too much food, and I'm a greedy pig. The policy is obviously to produce quantity over quality and hope everyone leaves sated. Not for me. Shame. It's a buzzy place and the food let's it down badly. Surprised at all the high marks.",

    "text": "'The Dangerous Type'My dad suddenly developed an adventurous side and is rampantly living it out by exploring new restaurants, one of them being Gordon Ramsey's wacky 'Maze'. We were rather shocked soon after opening the menu:-Chinese style pork belly, braised pig's head, crackling, jasmine tea -Irish ox 'tongue 'n' cheek', caper raisin and ginger carrots, horseradish pomme pur\u00e9Right...well then...I guess Gordon Ramsey was like, \"Just how off the rocker can my menu possibly be whilst still enticing Londonites?\" Apparently, you can never go too far if you're a celeb chef and his scheme totally worked. I was just a hamster in the maze, or an ox, or a skate, or a monkfish? Maze's stylish d\u00e9cor creates comfort in an other wise strange environment of audacious food and too many servers standing around with fancy dishes on their trays. The logo is very cool and can be seen everywhere from the floor pattern to the tables. To start off I had three scallops topped with granny smith apple, bacon, and butterscotch. WTF Gordon! I had the lamb dish with some other type of meat, and some other things on my plate I couldn't describe the taste or tell you the point of. The mashed potatoes were a cross between pudding and potatoes. I wasn't sure if they were the best potatoes I've ever had, or the worst. And The dessert. Oh the dessert! Definitely the best part, since we'd come this far I felt we had to see what the finishing touches were all about. And glad we did too because warm delicious chocolate cake thang with vanilla ice cream and some pistachio madness was smashing in top british style. Without ? the best 24 seconds of my day.  Top chef? hmm if you're into the wacky side of chef-ery then...sure.",

    "text": "Is lunch for two ever worth \u00a3125? This is a bigger question than we have the time or space to discuss in this review. Lunch at Maze was very expensive. The food was very good, and if you're looking to go to a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, you might as well give it a go. Maze's buzz is English cuisine with an Asian twist in the form of small plates. One of the dishes I got was braised octopus, oxtail vinaigrette, dehydrated black olive, fine herbs and confit lemon--you can definitely taste both the English and Asian influences. The presentation was the high point of the meal for me. The dishes were outrageously good-looking and ridiculous. Tiny scoops of bloody mary sorbet, a few tiny spoons of caviar, eel \"scratchings\"--each plate was designed to look like modern art. But although beautiful and very interesting, I didn't think the taste quite lived up to the looks. It was good, but it wasn't life changing. The service was perfect, although I do think they suggested we order more than we needed. We ended up with three dishes each (they recommended 4) plus 2 desserts and wine. \u00a3125 for a 2 person lunch is a lot. I'm still at a point in my life where if I spend that much on a meal I want my entire world to be rocked and for me to walk out of the restaurant a changed person. 3.5 stars but rounding up because of the rose jelly candy at the end.",

A nice dressy casual and relaxed restaurant with a large assortment of small plates to choose from.Instead of the prix fixe \"chef's menu\", our group ended up ordering a la carte off the \"tasting\" menu, each with four courses. The portions were generally small, maybe 4-5 bites each, but each bite was exquisite. Each of the dishes had a main element with some sort of innovative accent. Example: pan fried daurade with lobster risotto, crispy grey shrimp, fennel confit. It's a mouthful both to say and a great mouthful to eat.Loved the gratis dessert bites of baked alaska lollipops, chocolate truffles, white chocolate covered raspberries, chocolate pistachios, and a rose turkish delight type confection.Service was competent and unobtrusive.",

Friendly greeting by staff and nice waiting area where you can sit and chat while the group arrives. Modern, not-to-harsh dining area with nicely spaced tables. An interesting menu with two offerings, Tapas style English dishes where you can choose the number of courses and a flight of wines to accompany.You then choose the actual dishes (two puds-yum if you want!). The other half of the menu is a list of more substantial courses. Very satisfied with what arrived on the plate, though could fault soup as it was over salted, and the 'roast' salmon was cold & 'raw' in the centre, though tasty not my style. The other plates were absolutely spot on and delicious. Had the forced Rhubarb for health reasons(!). Wine we ordered separately and so I did not choose, but a good Viognier (2 off) and a very nice red from Portugal got us up to \u00a3270 for 4. Hic. Very good fun.",

    "text": "When I first went to the Maze, about a year and a half ago, I had just arrived in London, and didn't know anything about Gordon Ramsay. I just stumbled upon the restaurant one day I was in Mayfair with some friends \u00a0visiting from Italy and followed the (very good) TimeOut guide.Maze turned out to be an amazing restaurant, where I've been at least four other times since then, as I tend to bring there all the people that comes visiting from Italy (normally not thinking that food is one of the things why someone would visit London).The quality of the dishes is extraordinary: some of the matchings are simple genius, and in general over the course of a full meal one experiences some of the more intense and pleasurable gustatory sensations that can happen.The way the menu is organized is interesting as well: they have three different possibilities: a 5-course tasting menu (of the tapa-sized dishes, see below), a normal \"carte\" where one chooses entree - main - dessert, or a set of tapa-sized dishes meant to be taken in a number of 4-5 for a complete meal. I normally go for this last possibility because I'm more interested in variety than in quantity: while the quality is always amazing, though, the last time I went there I felt that 5 dishes hadn't been enough for filling me, and the final \u00a380 pp bill convinced me that in these hard times I'd better lower my culinary needs (and this is where the 4* comes from). Prices are around that value if you get lured by one of their excellent sommeliers into buying one of the very good wines they have on their wine list. It might be interesting to know that, at least until last year, at noon the 5 courses tasting menu became a 3-courses one, much cheaper and still a very good opportunity to taste some of their extraordinary preparations.Also, I sometimes popped up there with no reservation, and even if the place was full I could be arranged for a couple of seatings at the bar: it might be worth it (service is just as good), and if you can be put on the two sides of a corner you can still look in the eyes of the person you're eating with. ;)Ambiance: great. Service: great. Quality: great. Only gripe (and only once or twice): the amount of food you get with 5 tapa-sized dishes.",

    "text": "So, this is actually a flashback to probably the worst restaurant I've ever been to. Since this comical experience it may have completely changed and is actually good, but I just figured I'd share it with you for a laugh. I took notes at the time so it should be a fairly accurate recount.The front of house/ma\u00eetre d' staff were excellent. Friendly, helpful and accommodating. Now, if my mum taught me not to say anything when I have nothing nice to say, this little review would end here. You'd expect a prime time TV, celebrity chef like 'Gordon Ramsay' to establish a restaurant that serves delicious and inventive food. Don't be fooled people! Do NOT be fooled.I first began to question whether something might be very wrong when a waiter brought out the wine list displayed on his iPod. Um, why? Just why? It is neither cute nor cool. If the reason you go out to eat is for the posh setting, insincerely polite waiter staff, a nice ambiance and the d\u00e9cor you may love Maze. If you go out to eat for the food, you may not. It was inexcusable!I'm going to try to keep this as friendly as possible. So, in the spirit of things I've edited out most of the original notes, but have left in these pointers: Don't serve me soggy wonton-like dumplings with no detectable flavour aside from salt floating in what tastes, looks and smells like a bit of soy sauce in very watered down Knorr chicken stock. Don't pretend that any kind of banana cake is supposed to taste like a dry slice of unbuttered brown bread because it just so isn't. Under no circumstances should you place a dry chicken piece with half a broken bone left in it next to a fried flake of chicken skin, put that dirty duo onto a plate, and then have that plate placed in front of me. KFC is probably laughing at you. Lastly, try to avoid your beef and mash tasting like you picked it fresh from Asda's 'Taste the Difference' range. I honestly wish I was exaggerating, alas I am not.Even the presentation of the dishes was painfully average. It was like the effort was made to make it look like 'fine dining', but like the genuine creativity and passion that goes into producing a beautiful plate of food took the evening off.I will say though, I'm no wine buff but the wines that were matched to our courses were delicious. (Despite them not actually matching the courses. Never mind.)Bottom line.. don't trust celebrity chefs. A disgusted 2.9 out of 10.

You'd probably feel more comfortable in something collared but it's not mandatory. Warm atmosphere.Food: I'm not sure what everyone's raving about, but compared to restaurants of similar price/quality, this isn't anything to write home about. The steaks were good but not great--there's a wide-ranging selection, but both steaks my table ordered came underseasoned and undercooked. The sauces that accompany them were butter-heavy and uninspiring. The sides were ordered were good, but not particularly imaginative. One of us had the burger, which was pretty good, but not as good as the ones at Bar Boulud (while being a few pounds more expensive). Desserts were similarly underwheming--the apple crumble was scalding hot when we received it (but not bad once it cooled, which took a long while), and the chocolate/marshmallow/brownie dessert was bland: sure, all the pieces were there, but it tasted like sugar and butter. The brownie was dry and didn't have enough chocolate in it and the rest was pretty boilerplate. I guess that would sum up the food: by-the-book. Uninspiring. Not bad, but doesn't live up to the reputation.Service: Two of our starters were mixed up and our waiter was slightly clumsy--he poured the soup inattentively, drowning the croutons and garnish. We had to flag people down for water a couple of times, too--not what you expect in this kind of place.Value: Too expensive for what it is. Try Bar Boulud or Goodman--better food and better value. Conclusion: better value for money can be had elsewhere. The food is decent but not very creative. I expected better and was a little disappointed, especially when the bill came.",

The decoration is beautiful and simple the food is very good, but small as well so make sure to have at least 3 plate for each and good thing is that you can share and try a variety of they dishes plus this was by far one of the best services I experienced in London, they know everything perfectly and they way they describe not only the food but also they champagne and they wine they have is irresistible!I would recommend this place to go with friends and family and I think it's a perfect place to go if you have something to celebrate The Maze makes everything more especial.",

Ordered the beef tataki, octopus, pork and chocolate dessert (can't remember exactly what). The only let down was the pork, was pretty disappointed considering usually you can't get wrong with pork too much. But one miss out of four, it was forgiven. I loved the texture on the octopus, not chewy and very soft, just what I expected. The asian flavored beef tataki was excellent too, with nice soy-sauce like and hot pepper. The amuse bouche was okay, there were 3 /4 being served, but one in particular stroke me was this pork skin cracker or whatever they called it. It was just one out of many cracker / chips in the basket, but it stood out to me. Delicious. I was dining solo, so the server probably did not want to bother me too much and wanted to leave me in peace with my inner self. But it almost got too cold, functional and not as friendly as I expected it to be. But overall, for that price, i was satisfied.",

Every item I ordered was re-requested by the server some 5-minutes after the original order. Then, after having ordered \"chips\" for my meal - they were completely forgotten. In defense of good customer service, the chips were scratched from the final bill - but still, a top notch place like the Maze Grill should have bar service down to a science.Two things stick out - the bar-back who washed over 1-million glasses while I sat awaiting my food sipping my club soda was a delightful man of African decent who made every effort to make me comfortable (indeed, he was really the only one that gave me any attention); and, number two - the Austrian Pinot Noir the sommelier recommended was dynamite. Otherwise - the meal I had in Austin, Texas last week far outshines the meal I had at Maze Grill.Parting notes - there are much better places in a foodie city like London to drop 75 pounds for a seat a the bar.",

Food was tasty, but not \"exceptional\".... additionally all the food, across all three courses was served \"warm\", not served hot. Really surprised as the restaurant had so many staff on duty. The staff appeared to be working \"for the extra Christmas money\" as they had to be asked three times for basic items, more gravy, a knife, salt and pepper. Restaurant setting looked as if it had been styled by \"IKEA\", not the high end standard I was expecting from the man who has lots to say about life, and the restaurant business...... Deserts where the finishing touch, three of my party ordered the \"Apple Tart\" which was served upon a paper thin pastry crust, with burnt edges and one apple slice constituting the fruit...... I am embarrassed for the execution ! Thanks, but we will not be back any time soon.",

    "text": "I promised my wife that I wouldn't make our long-awaited UK vacation all about barbecue. When we discovered that world-renowned chef Gordon Ramsay had 'que on the menu at one of his London restaurants, she was kind enough to give me a hall pass for the day. I knew Gordon wouldn't be preparing my food himself, but I was still eager to sample the barbecue that his restaurant churns out.A swarm of about eight staff members showed up to attend to us as soon as we opened the door. They took our coats and umbrellas, got our reservation, and seated us in their plush lounge area for cocktails while we waited. The ambiance and decor at Maze Grill were both very inviting. Their spacious, modern dining room was classy and trendy without being overwhelming or pretentious.As anxious as I was to eat Chef Ramsay's interpretation of barbecue, I couldn't help trying out an appetizer first. We decided to sample the Chilli and Garlic Prawns, which come on grilled sourdough. The prawns were a little smaller than I was expecting, but were very tasty nonetheless. They definitely had some heat from the chili peppers, as well as a great sweet flavor. I also liked the bite from the garlic.Not only do they tell you about the different steak options available at Maze, they show you the actual steaks and describe the flavors and marbling in full glorious detail. I guess steak is more of a luxury in the UK, because their selections included a 12oz Wagyu ribeye for \u00a3130.00 (roughly $218.00). In Texas, I could probably buy a BBQ pit, a bag of charcoal, and four Angus ribeyes for the same price or less. I just stuck with my pre-planned entree selection and ordered the Smoked BBQ Pork Ribs, which also come with Chilli Pickled Cabbage. Since I didn't plan on more than a small tasting of the pickled cabbage, I also added a side of Mac & Cheese for good measure.Their pickled cabbage seemed like the Brittish version of coleslaw, neither of which typically agrees with my tastebuds. The cabbage was piled on top of the slab of ribs, so it came with its share of barbecue sauce. I found a nice crunch, as well as a pleasant acidic sweetness. The mac and cheese was delightfully creamy, and the crunchy topping added a good texture change. There was a good blend of cheeses, though I'm not sure what they were.I assumed from the outset that my pork ribs would be baby backs, but these were larger than anticipated. There was a thick layer of sauce slathered on top, so that was sure to be the dominant flavor. The sweet barbecue sauce was ok, but I think some molasses would have made it better. The rib meat was very tender. I couldn't really taste any smoke, probably due to the sauce. I'm not completely opposed to barbecue sauce, but I'd rather see the meat shine on its own. That being said, the ribs were still pretty tasty.There were a lot of great options for dessert, but we settled on their interestingly-named Knickerbocker Glory. I tried to listen to the description, but through our waiter's thick Hungarian accent, all I caught was \"meringue,\" \"salted caramel ice cream,\" and \"raspberry\". Good enough for me. This was by far one of the best desserts I've ever had. It was very complex: crunchy, nutty, creamy, chewy, sweet, salty, fruity, acidic, and chocolatey all at the same time. There were so many different flavors and textures going on, but they all somehow tied together perfectly.At the conclusion of our meal, the manager came over and invited my wife and I into the back to see how a real Gordon Ramsay kitchen operates. The sweltering heat gave me much more of an appreciation for the work these guys do. It was really kind of them to give us a quick mini-tour, and it made the experience all the more memorable. If I'd ordered a steak instead of ribs, I'm sure that Maze Grill would have been a five-star meal across the board. Regardless, it was really fun trying out some barbecue from across the pond.",

    "text": "Maze was my first Gordon Ramsay restaurant - it was located in the hotel I stayed at for about a week. \u00a0I will give 3 stars for the breakfast and 5-stars for the dinner for an average of 4 stars.Breakfast is fairly casual here - you can order off the menu or go for the continental buffet. \u00a0I had the ricotta pancakes with sliced bananas. \u00a0Although they were nicely presented I found them somewhat bland and wound up adding more syrup than I would have liked. \u00a0The black coffee was also somewhat bitter and grainy - surprisingly the free coffee in the hotel lobby was much better - dark roast but smoother.Dinner was an entirely different experience - the restaurant got darker and the ambiance became more formal. \u00a0Specialty items are sushi for appetizers and their amazing selection of steaks, ranging from the least expensive Aberdeen cuts to the most expensive Wagyu cuts. \u00a0Note that regardless of cut, all meats are aged over 28-days. \u00a0They even bring out some demos so you can choose between sirloin, filet, rump, or my favorite, rib-eye.Our group ordered the sushi combination platters, calamari, and grilled shrimp as appetizers. \u00a0The sushi was amazing - loosely packed rice that was seasoned, and fresh fish. \u00a0The California Roll was a bit unusual in that it had additional stuffing over the top, rather than the flat disk-shapes we have in the USA. \u00a0For entr\u00e9e, I ordered the Aberdeen 10-oz Ribeye cooked medium with a side of spinach. \u00a0All steaks were presented in a nice wooden cutting board with a knife labeling the doneness. \u00a0My steak was cooked medium and very juicy. \u00a0It also came with a head of roasted garlic which went well with the bread.Dessert was a bit unusual in that the entire menu had fruity items (Strawberry Trifle, Rhubarb, Tarts, etc.) but zero chocolate. \u00a0One of our colleagues jested with the waiter and was able to convince the kitchen to produce a chocolate brownie with ice cream. \u00a0It was one of their lunch menu items but the funny thing was many of use ordered it and really enjoyed the sweet dark taste of chocolate to finish off a heavy steak dinner.",

Hereford Sirloin, and while I'm no enthusiast, the cut of meat was very, very good. \u00a0There was just enough fat for the piece to be flavourful and it complimented my side of portabello mushroom and peppercorn sauce. \u00a0Quality food.However, at the end of the day I paid more than 30 pounds for a meal that was decently filling. \u00a0Now, I understand that you're paying for more than just the food, but you get the feeling that you're paying MUCH more simply because Gordon Ramsay's name is on the door, and for that reason I can't justify the cost.Maze is worth the visit, but if you're going to spend upwards of 50 pounds on a meal (and that's without a drink), it's probably better to just splurge and go to Ramsay's flagship restaurant in Chelsea.",

I had the 4 plate prefix meal.The first course was a spiced butternut squash soup with shredded pork and a parmesan crisp on top. By far the best dish of the meal. The soup had so much flavor--rich and hint of smokiness and spice. The pork was tender. Great!The second course was a roasted poison breast on a bed of ratatouille. This was just OK. No interesting flavors, but everything was cooked perfectly.The third course was a crispy pork belly with kale and grilled pears. Was just OK. The pork belly was cooked to perfection and the skin was delightfully crispy, but the sweetness of the pear really distracted me from the richness and savoriness of the pork.The last course was a pineapple tart. Light and not too sweet. Great way to end the meal.I had the meal with a wine pairing, and discovered a new favorite white wine: tariquet! The service was exceptional. The staff were very attentive without being overbearing. Would definitely come back again!",

I won't cover off everything we had but only to say the cured salmon, smoked eel and beef tataki were highlights. \u00a0The duck was also very good but I was so stuffed by the time it arrived, it ended up cold by the time I ate it. Pork belly could have been more tender. It was tasty but a bit on the hard side. The sommelier helped us pick the wine. Very friendly guy from Sardinia and he didn't balk when asked for a lower priced option. Overall, a great evening at Maze.",

We ordered the US style ribeye after the waiter capably explained the difference between the European beef and what we are used to in the states. My steak was the best ribeye I have eaten anywhere. Incredible. We enjoyed a nice red wine and finished off with a scrumptious chocolate cake with creme fraiche. Great dining experience.",

On the right side is the Grill and on the Left the regular Maze.I had reservation for the Maze Grill.The service was outstanding since the hostess, going though the waiter, buses food runners, everyone (maitre too).The menu is very good and there`s lots to orders, the bread as couverts cost 2 pounds and comes hot with good butter, is refill you can get as much bread you want and I recommend, you can save a little.I had to start the spicy tune tartare. Very good, A little bit too small and hard to eat, but definitely delicious. They had 3 types of dry aged steaks, Britsh, Rare Breed and American, being the last one the most expensive. I chose the British, we selected Rump Steak and Rib Eye.We selected the temperature as medium-rare and medium well. Both came a little bit of. The issue with the rump steak, came a little bit tough. The ribeye, I felt that the steak was to small for a ribeye, but I thin the weight on the menu is right.But now, these 2 steaks were not very dry aged, I had better before, I think the waiter should advise and talk to the customer more about the meat because I was a little disappointed.About the sides, a french fries with paprika, DELICIOUS, and EVEN MORE DELICIOUS, the Portobello Mushrooms!Go for it, I recommend, very nice place, but go aggressive on the meat, do not get the cheaper british one",

    "text": "OMG the confusion among these reviews is incredible: THIS IS MAZE GRILL NOT THE MAZE.If you are looking for the maze, look on the appropriate page, as this is the grill house in front of the Maze, called Maze Grill. \u00a0Half of the reviews here are wrong. So. Two restaurants at the same location, entering the restaurant you have the Maze on the left, a one-star (barely) fusion restaurant, and Maze Grill, a steakhouse. Both of them are owned by the celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay.My lady gave to me a coupon for a sunday roast at the Maze Grill, and we headed to the place on a sunny Sunday. The place has big windows looking directly on the Grosvesnor Square, which is good, but everything is ruined by the abundance of tables, definitely too many tables squeezed next to each other. Yes I understand this is supposed to be a family environment, but this is definitely too much for the amount paid.We seemed to pick the wrong date for a sunny roast: it was mother's day, and the first waiter told us there was no sunday roast menu, but after asking directly to the supervisor, the sunday roast menu was given to us (I find quite unbelievable our waiter did not know the whole menu, especially in a restaurant where service would like to be top notch. It's the second consecutive fault in service in the second Ramsay restaurant, and that's extremely unexpected and disappointing).Our entrees were a 3/5: my lady's cured meat board was lovely, with very deep flavors, while my burrata was a bit upsetting, while the cheese itself was good, as italian I can't bear the fact they drenched it in lemon and majoran. Why do you put other flavors when you have a splendid burrata?! It does not make any sense, you are just covering the delicate flavors of the fresh cheese and all in all you are ruining the dish.It must be noticed that our entrees itself were good, but they were actually uncooked raw ingredients. Good raw materials do not need any hardwork. They still managed to ruin one of the dishes thou.As main course, I chose the sunday roast, while my lovely wife opted for lamb chops. My sunday roast was composed by sirloin and bone marrow, served with Yorkshire pudding, brown sauce and a set of different vegetables. The dish was delicious, well prepared, well composed, there can't be any objection to that, it was just as a sunday roast should be. The vegetables were nice too, even if a bit blend and less inspired. But that's just me nit-picking, the dish was stunning. Same thing applies for the lamb chops, the meat was perfectly cooked and left no pieces while removing it from the bone, it was a very pleasant set of mains.All in all, it's a medium rating at this point: we had a couple of extremely good dishes, one that was ruined, and the service and the decor which brought down the rating. It's a shame, this place should deserve higher rating and I definitely expect to upgrade the rating the next time we'll get in a maze grill",

I really like the fact that the waiter that serve the food would explain to you what you were having and not leave you clueless as to what you were eating. Slight caveat would be that they take extremely long to serve the dishes. So for a simple 4 course meal it took them almost 2 hours to serve the food.",

The service is very nice although the place itself is a little hard to find.We had three people, ordered a burger with smashed potatoes, a fillet, and a rare-rib-eye; with wine accompanied and sushi and calamari for starters. The calamari is really dry, and sushi is just terrible. Don't waste your money on sushi here, the rice taste like not well cooked or left for days.Everything else worth the price. The steak are truly amazing, so juicy and fresh. The only complaint is that it is a little flavorless, even me who likes light flavored food felt like it need more spices on it. But the meat is just very right. The smashed potatoes is filled with aroma of butter and cheese, which is really delightful. We had a lunch there, the table is not hard to reserve. There are not so many people dining, so that it is fairly quite a place. Good to enjoy the food.",

I ordered a medium rare \"select\" 10 oz ribeye (39\u00a3) and my hubby a 12oz WAGYU steak (139\u00a3). We also got beer, a bottle of wine and salad, 2 sides of Mac & cheese and mushrooms. In total we spent 230\u00a3 about $350. My steak came out with burnt edges and medium well at best on the inside. (Like some other reviewers have said) I was not happy and told the waiter, who sent over the manager. She tried to tell me to cut into the meat further to see that is how they cook medium rare. I cut my steak several times, not convinced that this piece of meat was cooked properly. My steak looked horrible at this point being cut in several places. The restaurant is also really dark so it's hard to see. She finally relented and took it back. My new steak came and it was cooked perfectly. However it was gristly and had no flavor whatsoever. For that price tag...you'd expect to taste some good grass fed beef flavors. None. Zippo. Nada. Nothing. One of the most tasteless pieces of meat I've ever had...and I love almost any kind of steak. The WAGYU steak however was delicious...I consider ourselves lucky that this expensive meal was not all lost. The sides were also very bland. The iceberg salad was (13\u00a3) shockingly boring. It looked like it should be awesome, but was also very bland and disappointing. I wouldn't recommend coming here to anyone based on price and what you get for it. We left very disappointed with our meal that we had such high expectations for and was willing to drop some money doing it. Gordon Ramsey needs to come in himself and go Hells Kitchen on the chefs.",

So, while in London I had to give at least one of Chef Ramsay's restaurant's a try, and oh my was I taken away. The restaurant was absolutely stunning from it's wooden floors to it's bright colored tables and chairs. This restaurant was more than I would have imagine in such a small, yet quite part of town.Once seated, I ordered the Sirloin and potatoes. The steak melted inside of my mouth, and I feel in love through every bite. During my dinning experience, the staff was very attentive (yet, at the time of my visit the restaurant was empty), nonetheless the staff still remained professional. Overall, I must say that this restaurant and Mr. Ramsay should receive two thumbs up and a round of applause. This was a great way to end my vacation in London!",

    "text": "What a great place! The service and the food were fantastic. I loved the Tapas style idea of the Small Plates for starters we ordered 3 plates at \u00a36 each making a great sharing starter of baby squid & chilli, Aged Beef with roasted peppers & parsley (a carpaccio style dish) and a Soft Shelled Crab, all of which were really good. Then onto mains where I opted for the New York Strip steak, which was one of the best steaks I've ever had, the other half had the Aberdeen Angus Fillet (which I managed to snaffle a bite of and it was also delicious). we ordered 3 sides each (2 Mash, 1 Mushrooms, 1 French Beans, 1 Carrots & 1 Spinach and Gruyere) which were very nicely served in little cast iron pots. I opted for the Made at the Table sauce where they bring you a basic tomato/barbecue-ish sauce and a selection of herbs and spices so you can create your own custom sauce, brilliant! I accompanied my meal with a spanish beer that I now can't remember the name of, which is a shame because it was really good and unusual, when it arrived I thought the waitress had brought me a Coke by mistake judging by the colour of it. Desserts consisted of a delicious Strawberry Sundae for me with an interesting Cream Soda twist and my partner had the Vanilla Rice Pudding with Raspberries (which I can't really comment on as I hate Rice Pudding but she said it was lovely). After the meal we were treated to a tour of the (incredibly hot) kitchen where we were introduced to all of the kitchen staff all of whom were very friendly and willing to answer any questions. If you do go the Maze Grill and get the opportunity to tour the kitchen, my advice is don't stand in front of the broiler for too long it's like standing next to the Sun! All in all a great experience and a place I would definitely go back to and with friends.",

On entering the restaurant the experience was a pleasure, not what i had expected initially with a modern cafe bar type atmosphere (not stuffy or snotty). On seeing the menu our minds where made up to choose the chefs selection (after all they are paid to know and create the best so go with it). The food was all and more than we could have expected. I can't recall exactly what I had, but what I can say is it was worth spending that bit more. The surroundings the same, tables, fittings and crockery are not your off the peg bits and bobs, but obviously specialy selected and chosen with the purpose in mind, as with the waiting staff whom make your experience a pleasure. I have eaten at more expensive restaurants (not as often as I would like to though) but to date I think this place is hard to beat. Unfortunatley I don't think this will restaurant will achieve Michellin star status but that is the fault of the michellin star guidelines not the restaurant. I will look forward to visiting other Ramsey restaurants if this is the standard gained at the others. If you love great food then give this place a try when in London.",

    "text": "My star rating partly reflects the fact that I'm not overly keen on very rich food - if you are then you'll probably like Maze alot more than I did. I did the chef's table which was an amazing experience - we got to sit in the kitchen and eat a 12 course taster menu as we watched the kitchen staff cook and serve the food under the watchful eye of Jason Atherton. Jason was incredibly impressive and really nice. The food itself was very well done but just so rich - one of the courses was deep fried foie gras with steak and artichoke. It didn't help that I have no will power and the portions were quite big, so I felt quite unwell for a couple of days after I went - sort of like a food hangover but I think that was probably my fault. The most amazing thing that I ate was the peanut parfait with cherry jam, the closest thing I've had to it since is a snickers icecream but that really doesn't do it justice. I sometimes think about going to see if I could sit at the bar and just have that, it really was incredible. This would be an amazing thing to do for a special birthday or a very small wedding celebration. It's worth investigating the price but I don't think it was too bad.",

    "text": "First things first the steaks are magnificent no matter which one you choose be it the FDA or the wagyu or whatever. they start at a very good price(if small but everything is by my carniverous rex standards). the wine list is definitely overpriced and you'll be hard pushed to find anything half decent under \u00a330.To start we shared one of the plates, of rare beef, which was delicious. The wait staff were a little put out at this as apparently the more plates they sell the better. We then both had the FDA ribeye with red wine sauce, and ordered sides of mash onion rings and chips.My partner in crime was totally enamoured of his steak, it was a coup de foudre. However he was peeved to find only about 5 chips in his bowl of chips with greased proof paper scrunched up to make the bowl look full, hence I cannot say how light and fluffy they were as he scoffed them all down in double time.I did have both his and my bone marrow which gross as it sounds is delicious and thats how they make their fabulous red wine sauce.My mash was delicious and i did not share, but again only about a scoop in a bowl we did get one onion ring each and they were moist and crisp but not the best i've ever had.I had the donuts for dessert, which again were subject to grease proof paper to make them look more than they were.With, 2 cocktails, one average bottle of wine, one starter plate, 2 mains, 3 sides and a dessert the meal came to \u00a3200 giving our waiter \u00a325 AS A TIP. Now dont get me wrong, I worked as a waitress and I know how important tips are but I also know that all my credit card tips used to be taken and used to pay for outgoings like new dish cloths to replace the ones that the night porter ruined.I also know that a lot of these restaurants use the tips to cover wages which is wrong.I am therefore against discretionary tipping and would prefer to leave cash but was not offered that facility. I will of course return simply for the red wine sauce but honestly surely a tip on a party under 6 should be as it says discretionary and not automatically added on to the credit card bill!",

The principle was explained to us as 'English Tapas' but it has more in common with the Willy Wonka everlasting gobstopper concept - you get fairly small sized portions but every mouthful is so packed full of flavour and excitment that it feels as if you are having full meals. There are great Veggie options so ask if you are vegetarian (or even if you aren't!). We've always wanted to try desserts (the peanut butter and jelly sandwich sounds great) but are always too full despite 'small portions'! We have always left with that slightly spaced out happy feeling that amazing food produces. The staff have always been great when we went despite some of the other reviews. We found them friendly, not snooty, and full of good advice and not overly trying to 'push' a big spend. Love this place and reserve it for special treats!",

The first thing I noticed when we entered was that it was very loud! There is a private, \"Chefs Table\" on an elevated platform in the back of the restaurant. Around 12 men were up there and were being so obnoxiously loud that I literally had to yell at my my wife and daughter who were sitting across fro me. Seriously, I had to yell at them across the table to be heard. Naturally it's a chain reaction. You have to be loud to be heard, the next table had to be louder, etc. I even asked our waiter if it was always so loud. He blamed the football game but it was all coming from the private table. When I wanted another ice tea I had to flag down the Maitre d' and then five minutes later our waiter showed up and I asked him as well. Ten minutes later I finally got my ice tea! From a service and atmosphere standpoint, this was WAY below par of what a Gordan Ramsay restaurant should be. The only thing that was at the quality and standards I expected was the food. My wife and I ordered the beef Wellington for two and it was out of this world. Cooked to perfection and so tender and juicy it melted in your mouth. We opted to skip dessert just to get out of there and out to the street where it was quiet! Stepping out of the restaurant we all looked at each other and laughed at finally being able to hear each other.",

Fresh ingredients and simply a very good meal is to be had, indeed. Little, however, doesn't mean null. You see, I personally have a hard time eating a 10oz steak. Why, oh, why can't one order a lovely \"small plate\" without hindering the wanted flavors that only a steak can harvest? As a matter of fact, at the time of writing this, the only dishes on the Small Plate menu are: Salt & Szechuan pepper squid (Crisp fried squid, chilli & lime), Smashed avocado (Sweet potato chips), Popcorn chicken (Gochujang, spring onions), Edamame (Salt & pepper), Burnt ends (Pickled chilli, brioche), and Buffalo chicken fillets (Chilli & lime). But, no red meat. I don't want to diminish the artistry that was created because the meal was heartily enjoyed. I do though have a problem with wasted food and gluttony, without any other option to enjoy the wanted flavors. The staff was beyond helpful, the wine was delish, and, yes, the meal was lovely. I suppose it's a odd request of less... just give me options so I don't waste food.4 stars = flavor and service3 stars = to bring attention to the above",

Wouldn't you fast track that second steak without needing to be told? \u00a0Sure enough, our friends are complete, their plates bussed, when our steak hits the table.When the check came, the manager dropped it off and said I've removed the 12.5% service charge because I heard you had an issue. \u00a0More than anything, I was stunned that he had heard about the problem and this is the first time he stopped by. \u00a0Doesn't customer service start with him?Bottom line.

    "text": "Our reservation was for a Friday 4pm dinner. We arrived early, the hosts were very friendly and took our coats.Waiters: All of them were very pleasant and professional. Probably the greatest thing we felt was that we weren't being rushed. Even at the end when we were largely done, no one came and dropped the check. We had to ask for it. It's nice because many times in America restaurants make you feel rushed which is something i personally do not like after spending good money.Food:We went for the current promotion of \"One's on us\". It is basically a 3 course for 2 people priced at 24gbp. To start we ordered the popcorn chicken and the spinach potato salad. The chicken had some type of japanese marinade and it was incredibly moist yet had enough \"char\" on it from being baked/fried that made it one of the highlights. The salad was more rustic then i expected. It was basically leafy spinach with parmesan and potato shavings. The japanese dressing was different but it was quite good. I expected a more refined salad but it the end i enjoyed it.For main course we each got the 8oz flat iron steak. It was cooked to perfection. One detail to note is that many of gordon ramsey's restaurants use a JOSPER GRILL. I highly suggest you youtube what a josper grill is so you can see the difference between a GR steak and what most restaurants are doing with regular propane/gas grills. The meats Looked lovely and Smelled brilliantly. Having that wood cooked smell/taste was incredible. The steaks come with a small ramekin of marinated tomatoes. They were very tasty. We got a side of grilled mushrooms and crisps. Both were excellent.For desert, and quite possibly the highlight of the meal, we each got the frozen lime yoghurt toasted meringue.The lime yoghurt was excellent and a welcomed change on the typical sorbet offering because sorbet is just sugar water frozen. The warm meringue they spread out on the plate was a perfect compliment to balance the yoghurt out and the crunchy granola type mixture really topped this dish off.All in all this restaurant was AMAZING. I give it a 10 out of 10.Minor details: an 8.5% \"Service charge\" is added to the bill. Also, there was a 4 gbp \"cover charge\" per person.",

    "text": "First of all, as others have stated, there is a lot of confusion by reviewers as to which restaurant they actually went to. \u00a0I can tell by some of the pictures that people are writing reviews for the wrong restaurant.This place is generally pretty busy, so I would def recommend reservations. \u00a0And yes, it is pricey and you pay a premium for this being a GR restaurant. \u00a0One tip is to sit at the bar as you can eat from the menu without the wait and the formality. \u00a0I will warn you though, you cannot actually sit facing the bar while using the bar because the bar top and the front of the bar are flush, so there is no where to put your legs. You have to sit a bit askew.Drinks: \u00a0Drinks are absolutely lovely. \u00a0Do not miss the Sea Foam Margarita! \u00a0I love margaritas and this is the best I have ever had.Appetizers: \u00a0I would say that this is where this restaurant really shines. \u00a0Some very creative and exiting appetizers. The soft shell crab sliders were perfection.Deserts: \u00a0Also, lovely.Main Fare: \u00a0If you're American, don't get the beef. \u00a0It's super expensive and for what you pay, does not compare to what you can easily get in the US for much cheaper. \u00a0(I can't speak for the super expensive Wagyu beef, unfortunately.) \u00a0The other entrees were very simple, but done to perfection. \u00a0It reminded me of having a grandmother or mother who is an incredible cook. \u00a0If you're looking for something outrageous, you will probably be disappointed.Service: I think sometimes we forget that the UK is a totally different culture than the US. \u00a0The staff here is much more reserved than one would expect in the US. \u00a0Our waiters were attentive \u00a0and did their jobs extremely well, \u00a0but there were not chatty as one might expect in the US. \u00a0(The one exception was the waiter that was not from the UK). Overall, if you're a GR fan and have a bit of splurge money, try maze grill - especially, if you're staying right next door at the Marriott.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I went to this restaurant after reading really good reviews online and having also been to 'Heddon street kitchen', also by Gordon Ramsey, which was excellent.To our great disappointment this restaurant was just terrible...Most of the dishes were over salted (calamari, popcorn chicken).The onions rings were full of oil and the mashed potatoes were hard.Fish and meat were average (not bad, not excellent...).We started to think that the one and only objective of the restaurant is to make a profit ! What further confirmed our assumptions was that you had to pay 2.5\u00a3 extra per sauce and the wine glasses were really under filled compared to other restaurants (and I come from Bordeaux .Then the bill came with a surprising 2\u00a3 per head extra charge. When I asked the waitress why this was (in addition with 12.5% for service), she seemed embarrassed and told us 'Because of the room you are in, and the status of Gordon Ramsey'. I answered that I had never seen this in any restaurant in the world, to which she replied 'I could deduct that charge from the bill if you prefer'. If this is an 'optional' charge, why is it added to the bill without the customer's consent ? Would all customers pay this charge if it was known to be optional ? I was in pure shock.Total for 2 starters, 2 mains + sides and 2 glasses of wine : 125\u00a3We left the restaurant extremely disappointed, and checked the menu outside out of curiosity. It was exactly the same as the inside menu except, they didn't show the extra charge for the sauces - sneaky move..I usually don't write reviews online but this experience left us feeling so cheated that we believed that other customers have the right to know what's going on in this restaurant. In my opinion the only good point would be it's chic ambiance and decent service.I'd definitely nominate this restaurant to be on the next episode of Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares !Stay away !!",

With the exception of our sommelier, they were just awful - unhappy, robotic, unsmiling; the hosts who greeted us at the door were downright rude. While the menu looked promising with many of my favorite foods, it was mediocre at best. \u00a0I was really shocked given how discerning Chef Ramsay's standards are on the show ( but guess that is just the magic of television)! \u00a0The restaurant is modeled after a New York style steakhouse but the piece of steak I had was just awful -- far from the tender, deliciously grilled cuts of meat I have had back home in NYC. \u00a0And the worst part? The bill: 170 pounds (200 euros)!!!! \u00a0That was for the 4 of us: 1 child eating a kids menu, 1 child eating a bowl of soup (5,50 pounds for a very small portion) & order of fries, 1 adult eating 2 starters, and 1 adult eating a main and a dessert. Plus 4 glasses of wine (nothing spectacular or over the top). \u00a0To say we felt ripped off would be an understatement. \u00a0We've enjoyed such delicious meals on recent trips to London, this was incredibly disappointing and just a bad experience all round.. \u00a0Sorry Chef but we won't be trying you again.",

I didn't want to mention anything because I did want it to be a surprise and I wasn't away from the bf during the meal to subtly ask the waiter. I was told on the phone that they would note the dinner was for a birthday. It was a shame and left me disappointed because I was really looking forward to it . I decided not to say anything because 1. didn't want to spoil a good night and 2. we were quite full anyway.

We had a fun night here and drank and ate some wonderful interesting things, but it all felt a bit like it was trying a bit too hard. We opted for the tasting menu, which of course meant lots of tiny little dishes that were just about big enough for a mouse to get its little teeth around. Definitely don't come here if you're hungry. Come here if you want to feel cool and if you want to try the Gordon thing, but from a foodie point of view, it's an odd restaurant. Don't get me wrong, the food was beautifully cooked and resembled works of art rather than food on a plate and the science behind food combinations was in itself impressive, but if you're in the mood for a nice satisfying dinner where you really want to eat something, this probably isn't the right place. It's perfect for business lunches or maybe even business dinners if you're all in the fashion industry and don't want to eat anyway. Lovely G&T's served before the meal and the service was pretty good, as you'd expect, or hope. One strange thing we couldn't quite get over was the ridiculous wine menu - it was an oversized thing that looked more like a hardback book than a wine list. The waiter didn't offer any help on the wine and we didn't know where to start. It kept closing on itself so difficult to have a quick flick and almost too heavy to pick up with sooooo many pages. I wanted to say to the waiter, just show me your top 5 wines and we'll go with one of those, I can't be bothered with this massive wine encyclopedia!!",

However, it certainly isn't pretentious like some other establishments. I had the set menu of 7 courses which ranged from scallops to fois gras all cooked and served beautifully. Each of the 7 dishes was tapas sized but can still be quite heavy. With a bottle of wine and a coffee aftewards you're looking at just under \u00a3200. Worth the money though!",

I have been here a fair few times, and can say without question that i have never had a bad meal here. Book in advance for weekends for sure, and be prepared for a hefty bill, but also note the food is exceptional, interesting selections and mixes and if you have the chance, do try and get a group to the chefs table, an exciting dining experience.",

    "text": "I had the best steak of my life at the Maze Grill! I opted for the Rib Eye on the bone, not cheap at \u00a323.50 but worth every penny. The imported broiler that they have brought in from USA means that every steak has that perfect crust on the outside whilst still be moist and rare in the middle. The service was dissapointing, staff forgot to bring over our wine, and then our steak sauce and an apology was not forthcoming. The pricing is ramped up by having to pay seperately for each side each but all the dishes we had (gratin, mushrooms and mash) were good, but very small. Go to this restaurant for the steak but do not be alarmed by the hidden extra's or the steak on the menu for \u00a3110!",

    "text": "Simply the best steak, meat I have ever had!!! Not only was it the most tender and succulent that has ever past my pallet but I knew what I was eating (I will get to that bit later on). Unlike most grill houses on arrival you are ushered to your table like royalty as if to say this way sir to experience the best taste the world has to offer the waiter is then called to your table holding a meat plate (whatever that is) which is stacked with 4 major slabs of meat he/she then spends the next 5 minutes educating you about the origin and how the meat has reached its spectacular taste (interesting fact the unique Chinese cows are apparently played music and sung to by the farmers, little do the cows know that this is all for our benefit). Actually it was very interesting and I spent more time asking him questions. The meal will set you back between \u00a322-\u00a325 just for the steak but I will guarantee you a substantial return of investment.",

I had the girlled asparagus with poached eggs and grapefruit hollandaise for starters. OMG it was like taking food heroin for the first time. The damn asparagus was just grilled but - wow! The grill must be made from gold or something! The hollandaise.. it was like eating clouds! Just light and disappears in your mouth and the zing from the grapefruit just gave me tingles down my neck! Poached eggs are just poached eggs.. But they were very pretty eggs. Nice shape!Mains, I had the rump steak with chips and a side salad. I've had better rump, chips are chips, salad was good tho.. The dressing was delectable! It the dressing was hot, I'd eat it as a soup. Dessert, I had chocolate mousse and pistachios. If I was alone, I'd lick the plate clean. Sigh, wished i was alone for 5 secs. I really wanted to lick the plate. Bummer..I ate everything - clean. Used bread to wipe up the salad dressing. Went home and had food induced coma for 4 pleasant hours :)",

    "text": "I'm going into this review as Maze wasn't my 1st choice, as we only had 1 evening in London. My daughter, 8 years old named Adrianna has a crush on Chef Gordon Ramsay!! \u00a0As we travel across the US & now foreign lands our food experience have to revolve around Mr. Ramsay per my 8 year old Adrianna. We have go to: The London NY, Paris Hotel, The London in LA, & now Maze in London. Initially I was not excited over another Ramsay establishment; they are lovely bit @ times are bigger than their britches. I must say Ramsay VeGas & Paris is lovely, not my cup of tea. \u00a0Again, my 8 yr old is infatuated with Mr Ramsey & is dying to tell hi to \"piss off\" as in jest & to show she is his #1 fan. As I digress, we happened to be in London & made valid arguments to dine where she wishes. This evening my wife & surprise her & take her to London Maze, knowing Mr. Ramsey wouldn't be present. \u00a0We arrived a bit tardy approx. 9:30 & needless to say a child after an 8hr time difference & 20 hr flight was a boy groggy is an understatement. \u00a0She proceeds to eat sushi sampler & then let it be known she was done & tired.I am not a patient man so I hurried my meal, the girls went to restroom & gave me a moment to speak to Danya & explain my daughters love of ALL Ramsay!!! \u00a0Danya \u00a0did not take praise with a grain of salt , she reacted. & gave my kid the time of her life while she experienced her fears. @ overcame them. Danya did not Stop there but she brought her other employee of service over, Weronika & they took a dream to a fantasy. My daughter had already met the chef & staff, but this go around they helped her make her own dessert. To this day because of that kindess, she is speacialPS TO MANAgEmEnt & Gordon::I know & realize you only hire top notch \u00a0chefs & staff & your name proceeds your establishments. I frequented many throughout the LA/ Ny/Miami/uk, with always a smile due to quality control. Though I'd really like to take a moment to let you be aware of 2 spectacular employees that made an 8 year olds life ! \u00a0 Danya @ Maze questioned on why Maze & my 8yr old proceeded to tell her you are her favorite & would t stop. All on in all Weronika & Danya went above all & saw my daughter tiring. & made out expietence amazing. These 2 girls went above & beyond to assure great service.",

    "text": "Go here only if you want to boast to people that you have been to Gordon Ramsey's Maze. Otherwise, the whole set-up is very pretentious. You need to take a magnifying lens with you to even see the minuscule portions (nouvelle cuisine at its extreme). This is our experience and decide for yourself if this is what you want: We went to this restaurant with my wife on 25th April 2011 to have their 'Early Supper Menu', as part of a birthday celebration. Their offer was: 3 'dishes' for \u00a325 or 4 'dishes' for \u00a336 (with wine this would have been \u00a345 or \u00a356, respectively -- but neither of us is keen on wine, so we chose the menu without the wine). The very first impression was with the young receptionist lady. She employed a strangely sarcastic tone, when checking our booking. Then we were shown to our table by a very polite waiter. Our orders were taken. Unexpectedly, we got a complimentary glass of decent champagne. It was a nice start. We ordered carbonated water. Then the irritation started: a waitress came along and filled up our glasses repeatedly even when we hadn't drunk any of the previous serving. We were pleased, though, when they brought some bread (four short stick breads) and butter. Later on we found out that it was lucky that we had eaten the bread before the 'dishes' were served, because this proved to be the main filler. One of the army of waiters (there were nearly as many waiters as there were guests) kindly offered more bread, which we were pleased to accept. Then came the courses. For the first course we both ordered a dish called 'marinated beetroot, Dorstone organic goat's curd, pine nuts, Cabernet Sauvignon dressing'. The goat's curd was the kind you can buy in any supermarket. And now imagine the size of this dish: it contained three little pieces. Each piece consisted of two wafer-thin slices of beetroot - about 30 mm in diameter: just over an inch - with a teaspoonful of goat's cheese in between, and with a few toasted pine nuts on top. The 'Cabernet Sauvignon dressing' was unnoticeable - lucky that the name alluded to it, otherwise we wouldn't have guessed. For the second course I had chosen 'braised veal shin, rocket pesto, white onion risotto'. The dish came on a plate about 250 mm in diameter with a very small, maybe 80 mm wide central depression in its middle, and in this small central bit was the smallest piece of meat I have ever seen. The rolled up morsel of meat was shorter than my thumb (I have an average size male thumb), and it was about the thickness of my thumb. The rocket pesto was practically undetectable. The 'white onion risotto\" was about half an average mugful in a small bowl, the kind of size they usually put olives in. True, all of it tasted great, I think - I only think so, as there was hardly enough to trigger the tastebuds. Finally, the dessert came: I had ordered 'hazelnut parfait, pistachio meringue, cherry sorbet'. This was about twice the size of the previous 'braised veal shin', so by this time I was grateful. True, the cherry sorbet was half the size of my pinky (and I have smaller than average pinkies). In the meantime the armies of waiters milled around, and kept asking useless questions. One of them didn't even try to pretend that he genuinely meant his question. In English, tone is everything, and he was giving away his attitude. My wife went for 'Loch Duart salmon, fondue of leek, vinaigrette of brown shrimps, horseradish' as the second dish. She was happy with the taste, and her salmon was visible without a magnifying lens, but the brown shrimps were like those small water bugs you see in fertile summer ponds. She was quite satified with her chosen dessert: 'Summer fruit crumble, berry sorbet, elderflower mousse, granola'. This portion was about right. In the end, as we were going to pay the bill, we were given a piece of chocolate cake (not charged for) to share between us - about the size of two normal matchboxes on top of each other, to make us 'finish with a smile'. It tasted very good. We payed about \u00a360 for all this (that included one bottle of sparkling water and the 'service charge'). There are many other much better restaurants in London where you don't pay less, but at least you get a normal portion and genuinely friendly service without the pretence. I wondered how the waiters could serve those derisory portions with a straight face.",

I was lucky enough to be taken to one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants Maze for my birthday and what a fine experience it was!The restaurant area is laid out in a circular format and we were sat in the middle which made people watching an exciting part of the whole experience. The atmosphere was buzzing and the crowd was refined but not intimidating or pretentious. You simply come here if you like (and can afford) good food.The waitress (who was wonderful) advised that we pick around 6 dishes each - 3 from the lighter menu and 3 from the richer one. Each dish came beautifully presented with a twist on modern British dishes. I ordered a BLT and was presented with 2 tiny pieces of bread, the best salmon I have ever tasted and the remainder in a glass as a soup/liquid version. It does sound a bit gross maybe, but it was beautiful. The portions are small but after 3 dishes I was full - they are extremely rich and the most delicious I have ever tasted. The trout and meat are just divine.When we asked the bill, we were also given a selection of complimentary chocolates which was a lovely touch. I didn't see the bill but I know for 2 of us it was over \u00a3100 and considering we only had a glass of wine for \u00a35.50 each, and I refrained from dessert, the food is expensive but oh so worth it. I certainly can't afford to come here more than once in a blue moon but it is absolutely worth the extra pennies for a special occasion.",

Salcombe crab, brown crab and toast sorbet, sea herbs, pickled black radish, apple vinaigrette (\u00a310.50). \u00a0Extremely small. \u00a0The crab sorbet was rather fishy. \u00a0Not at all like the incredible lobster ice cream in Martha's Vineyard.2. Quail, kohlrabi, cauliflower in 'ras el hanout', burnt onion reduction (\u00a310.50). \u00a0Tasty, but still extremely small. \u00a0Not luxurious enough to justify the tiny portion.3. Hake with cockles and bacon in fish soup (\u00a312.50). \u00a0The hake was delicious but the cockles tasted either old or canned (neither of which I would expect at a restaurant of this caliber). \u00a0Bacon was good. \u00a0Presentation was attractive.4. Monkfish with oxtail and lentils (\u00a312.50). \u00a0Again the fish was well prepared, but still rather small. \u00a0The flavor of the dish was nice and savory.5. Slow cooked Suffolk pork fillet and cheek, various onions (\u00a313.50). \u00a0This was probably my favorite. \u00a0Everything on the plate was delicious.6. Roasted Muntjac deer, pine nut pur\u00e9e, baby beets, oats, seeds and juniper (\u00a313.50). \u00a0Also quite good and at a decent size. \u00a0This and the pork dish were the only ones worth the money.DRINK: \u00a0My Pear and Passion Fruit Caipiroska was truly delicious and reminded me of Brazil. \u00a0There was a generous amount of passion fruit in the drink (\u00a310).THE BOTTOM LINE: Don't come here expecting to be full. \u00a0We found the process of bringing the food out to be quite strange. \u00a0A guy (not the waiter) would come from the kitchen bearing prepared food on a tray. \u00a0Then they would stay in one position until the waiter/waitress could be be bothered to carry the plates from the tray to a table. \u00a0In many cases, there were up to 4 guys lined up at once, and the food would literally just wait on the trays getting cold.We were absurdly grateful for the delicious bread, without which, we would have left the place feeling rather ravenous.The attentiveness of our waitress left something to be desired. \u00a0My empty cocktail glass sat on the table the entire meal until I finally put it on the empty table next to ours. \u00a0Same with the butter and the empty bread container.PARTING THOUGHT: Does anyone else think the restaurant bar area looks a bit like an airport?",

    "text": "Well, where do I start?! Quite frankly one of the most fun and impressive Michelin-starred experiences I've ever experienced.I was really lucky to be invited as part of a group attending the Chef's tale last Friday. We arrived, sat in Gordon Ramsay's flagship in Mayfair, and had some bubbles and canap\u00e9s to start. Juicy prawns, tofu foam (hmmm, not sold, but ok) and vegetable crisps.When ready, we moved up to the table, which is right at the back, with a partition to separate you from the main restaurant, a big window into the kitchen and a door that leads directly in.Our server for the afternoon, managed the ten-strong table of excitable adults with ease, and our sommelier matched a glass of wine to each of the seven courses beautifully.For each dish, the chef responsible came in to explain what we were eating, and we were given garlic soup with quail egg, white crab with brown crab and toast ice cream, the most tender lamb I've ever eaten, a wonderful cheese course and two desserts - one of which included a basil panacotta.Though it truly was some of the best food I've ever eaten, my favourite part was the kitchen tour. For at the end, I got to help cook the fish course!!!First things, first. Cooking on one of those open topped ovens IS LIKE STANDING NEXT TO THE EQUATOR. The chef helping me (well, I was helping him) put olive oil in three pans, then nine pieces of red mullet split divided between them. Two minutes on one side, then I got to flip them and 40 seconds later. Done. Onto some kitchen roll, lemon, salt, then I handed them to the chef. After he did his professional serving thing, I had to introduce the food to the table, which is Maze's signature dish.I can still remember: \"Pan fried red mullet with black squid ink, micro squid, garlic puree, a cuttlefish tagliatelle and a rabbit bolognese\"Awesome!! And so tasty...I can't even imagine how much it cost, but if money was no object, I'd take all of my best friends here for the experience. It was truly special, and I'll continue to rave about it to everyone who'll listen :)",

    "text": "Sex or food? A tough call to decide which I like more. On the basis of the simply phenomenal dining experience this week at Mr Ramsey's Maze restaurant, I'd have to say... I think food may have just sneaked ahead.Upon arrival, I knew this was going to be a night to remember. We started with a French champagne, the first of several alcoholic beverages, and began to peruse the menu. We were told that for first timers we should give the Chefs set menu a squizz. 6 courses. 2 entrees, a starter, a main course, cheese and a pudding. \u00a365. Spenny, but this way you get a chance to sample arguably the best things on the menu, reducing the likelihood of that common disease, 'food envy.' \u00a0I won't go into the details of each meal, but rest assured they were all incredible. What was great was the knowledge the waiters and waitresses had of each course and their suggestions for wine for each course we all equally spot on. With a quick trip into the kitchen to see how this well oiled machine runs, courtesy of my friend Martin who is the Ma\u00eetre d, you could say that this was one of most incredible dining experiences I've ever had. The decor is smart and simple. Nothing too fancy, it just works. I'm also a sucker for Molten Brown, so I took full advantage of the bathroom facilities.Granted that with a bill \u00a31 short of 700 squirrels, this was a rather extravagant way to spend a Thursday. It was a rather unique experience because I was taken there for a no holds bared night. In a nut shell we were allowed to eat and drink as much as possible and all would be expensed! Therefore, make sure you go with a sweaty stack of cash because his type of cuisine ain't cheap. From what I understand Maze does a very reasonable set menu for lunch. Probably a better way to sample this incredible restaurant. Too surmise: A-MAZE-INGSexy Rob",

The environment if very clean and stimulating, staff very attentive without overdoing it. The real pleasure is in the food itself. Smaller portions so you get to order a few things which I find more appealing to my pallet. Everything we tried was exceptional but my favorite was the pork belly. A very difficult dish to properly execute. Dessert was no exception, you must try the lemon tart. I will be returning during one of my future London trips.",

    "text": "Very good food, but overpriced for what it is.We ate here on a Tuesday evening. We indulged in the:Squid, very good. Nice flavours, fresh squid.Sliders, fair. Pedestrian slider.Nigiri plate, good. High-quality fish with good freshness.USDA prime ribeye, good. A very thin cut but tasty, perfect medium rara and they finished it with butter. Lots of butter. Bechamel sauce was a good example.Maze Sundae, good. Much more brownie than ice cream was an (unpleasant) surprise but the flavours were there.Creme Brulee, very good. Just a prototypical example of a good one.Their wine-by-the-glass was easily the smallest/least wine per glass I've ever gotten at a restaurant. More like a flight in a wine service. Their menu for half bottle reds (to go with the steak) was sparse. Four of them were between 25-35 pounds and the fifth was 77 pounds. I wanted something in the middle and knew I was in trouble with the cheaper ones. I went with the Bordeaux and it was a pretty lousy bottle of wine. Shame.The restaurant is a little loud, too. That's a personal preference thing, but my preference is surely for a quiet meal.So why four stars? The food WAS good. If I rate something three stars I generally don't care for the food. I would want to come back to Maze, I just would want someone else to pay. Value for money wasn't there.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to eating at this restaurant on my recent vacation to London. \u00a0My wife and I met up with friends who lived in London and we made reservations weeks prior.The Pros - Nice atmosphere. \u00a0Since it was 8 of us, they sat us in a private room overlooking the Kitchen. \u00a0Everything is very clean and I really liked the Layout. \u00a0The mixed drinks were very well crafted and tasty.The Cons - The service was very poor, rude and unorganized. \u00a0Waitress didn't really know the menu. \u00a0Don't even try to ask her a question as she will just stare at you. \u00a0They had a different person running the credit card machine and \"idiot\" doesn't even come close to describing him. \u00a0Also because he is such an \"idiot\" if you try to question him at all he becomes defensive and rude. Everyone seemed to enjoy their meals but I thought it was just ok. \u00a0Coming from Boston and eating at many high end Steakhouses, this restaurant just did not compare. \u00a0If it was a low end steakhouse like an Outback, I would say the steaks were good. \u00a0The sides were very bland and nothing really stood out.I did say earlier the drinks were good, well their glassware not so much. \u00a0I picked up my drink and the bottom gave out and the drink fell all over me. \u00a0I think the cups at McDonalds are more durable. \u00a0You would think they would at least give you a complimentary drink, but not at Gordon Ramsey's.Dessert was ok, nothing special. \u00a0Usual array you would find at any restaurant.Overall this place was just ok. \u00a0I was going to give it 2 stars, but that would suggest I might give it another shot. \u00a0I would never go back to this place or any Gordon Ramsey restaurant again.If you are coming from the US, I would suggest avoiding. \u00a0You will be very disappointed with the portions and overall flavor. \u00a0London has many wonderful restaurants and this place is not one of them.",

And this one was no different. \u00a0Although it was very reminiscent to the roast pork you get at the Chinese deli. \u00a0Still, very very good.* Blackberry and something else crumble - loved it! \u00a0Perfect blend of tartness and crunchy bits and super light after all the fat I consumed in the pork belly.Overall, I'd definitely go back for the set course menus, as they give you the perfect amount of each dish and you get to try so much.",

Sommelier doesnt know much about their wines or beers. Took forever to get the food. Waiter asks if we want more water and then forgets to bring it. Waiter messes up with the order and the worst thing is that they are rude about it. Poor value for the high price. The food was good though even if I was too pissed of to enjoy it.",

Unbelievable service from the doorman wearing the sweet bowler hat, to the three funny and charming hostesses and of course out superb waitstaff which included a charming girl from Melbourne Australia who gave us a tour of the six meats available to be grilled and a nice gentleman. I went with a friend and we decided to share and ordered the shrimp in garlic and chili and tuna tartar for starters. Both we're amazing. We then ordered to different Sirloins and the waiter asked whether we would like it sliced out of the kitchen which was a nice touch. They were deliciously cooked medium rare. As side dishes we had fries and broccoli which were just ok. Finally we had the special desert which had ice cream and marshmallow , nuts and a whole bunch of other stuff which was out of this world. At the end we were invited back to the kitchen and met the head chef. Quite a delightful experience. If you can afford to go, it is a very nice experience at a Gordan Ramsey restaurant.",

    "text": "I always make it a point to dine at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants when visiting London. This time around, we had dinner at Maze. Three for three. Our best meal, yet again. Bravo Chef. Maze is a beautiful restaurant that also has the a more casual grill. The decor is sleek, hip and sexy. We were taken to a round section of the dining room and seated at a comfy two top that was nicely spaced from the other diners. That can be a problem, though I've never seen that at any of GR's places. I spied a cool looking chef's table towards the back that had a nice view of the kitchen where you can watch the craftsmanship up close. Pretty cool. Our server promptly greeted us and presented us with our menus. She explained that we may choose the Chef's tasting or dine a la carte and that the menu is designed tapas style with smaller portions. Many options and the tasting menu looked incredible. But, that's always tough for us to coordinate. We share everything anyway (you mean you don't?) so we would have our own tasting. Starters were the Salcombe crab, grapefruit fluid gel, mango, and wasabi ice cream and Marinated beetroot, Sairass cheese, pine nuts and Cabernet Sauvignon dressing. I liked the crab very much and the fruity accompaniments were tangy compliments to the fresh and light crabmeat. The beets were great too and Kris made short work of them, to the point where I barely got a bite. Round two was Orkney hand dived scallop, raisin and ginger vinaigrette, texture of turnips, crispy chicken skin and Halibut, carrot pur\u00e9e, caramelised endive, coriander, citrus glaze. Both excellent. Next for me was the Cornish lamb rack and shoulder, English garden mint gel. I had to have it and had the extra course. It was served nice and red. So good that I hardly noticed myself gnawing on the bone before my wife chided me for my caveman behaviour. The last dish we both had was the Roasted Muntjac deer, crushed celeriac, chestnuts, red cabbage and spiced chocolate jus. Again served perfectly cooked and on the rare side. Don't bother over cooking this as you'll want to enjoy this succulent cut of meat. It was delicious and the chocolate jus highlighted the many flavors that were part of this dish. We finished our wine and chatted with our Sommelier about her recent trip to Napa and how she was born in the region of France where we were enjoying our wine from. That was kind of cool. We contemplated the dessert choices and opted for the Peanut butter and cherry jam sandwich, tonka bean cream and dehydrated cherries. PB and J was never so good. I had high expectations for our evening at Maze and our meal here exceeded them in every way. The style of the restaurant was modern and cool, even the loo was hip. The service was spot on attentive and equally well dressed and well informed. The captain that stepped in to clear our dessert plate was able to tell us everything about it. I never felt rushed and we were never in need of having wine or water topped off. Staff was on top of it. We had a tasty amuse bouche which I've since forgotten. Portions were on the smaller side. But, that just meant we got to try more. Ingredient quality, creativity and preparation were top notch. If you leave hungry, you have yourself to blame. Reason enough for another flight across the pond. Until next time chef.....",

The wine specialist is fantastic and friendly. There were two the night I came. It was a litle funny though because one of them suggested a wine and then when he had gone and we asked the other one to give us the wine the first one suggested, , he didn't know wha it was. No worries though because we still go a great bottle. I also loved the peppermint / milky alcoholic beverage they serve as what I think is their signature cocktail. Great ambiance. Great food.
