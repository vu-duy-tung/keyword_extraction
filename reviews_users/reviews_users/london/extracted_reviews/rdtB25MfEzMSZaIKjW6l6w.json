    "text": "Indian/Bangladeshi restaurants are all over Brick lane, Thai restaurants are difficult to come by. My partner and I went out to find a place to eat for his birthday meal. We were torn between the chain Busaba Eathai and Kinkao, this independent establishment. We opted for the latter. We had no reservation but after a 10 minute wait were seated at around 9pm.The interior is quite typical of a Thai restaurant in the UK, buddha statues and gold carvings abound. We were starving and ordered as soon as we were seated. My partner chose the chicken massamam curry whilst I went for the tofu green thai curry. We both had a portion of coconut rice. The service was friendly, fast and efficient. The portions sizes were just right for the price (the entire bill came to around \u00a320) and we ate everything, meaning we left Kinkao feeling very full... Next time I might share a curry.We will be back to try out the \u00a35.95 lunch deal!",

    "text": "I ventured over here in the cold after having read the latest Yelp weekly mail featuring Thai restaurants and being of a mind to try somewhere new. It is at the north end of Brick Lane. It looks like a big restaurant, but it was near empty when I went there on my mission.I hesitantly walked in, unsure if I was coming in when they were closed. But I was soon recognized and I asked about what I could get to take away. I had a token look through the menu, but I had really made up my mind when I browsed the menu online earlier.I got the green curry with chicken and some vegetable spring rolls. It took about five minutes to prepare and the lady packaged it up nicely to take away. The container of green curry had a layer of plastic wrap on top to help guard against spills on the way to the office. I also discovered later that the container had two sections: one for the curry and one for the rice. I love that because it gives me control over my curry/rice distribution.The lunch was tasty: both starter and curry. Nice sauce and a good level of heat. I would go back and get take away again. It was worth walking there in the cold.",

    "text": "It is mind blowing to see how much Kinkao has invested into their restaurant. We entered into their restaurant and was mesmerized by their wooden furnishing and only to realised they got it handcrafted and shipped from Thailand. Tables and chairs of beautifully carved pictures conveying Thai culture. It was one of the restaurant that most attracted our eye whilst walking down Brick Lane and hence how we found this gem. But could the decor just be compensating it's quality of food? Not at all. Instead I can say it is probably one of the best Thai restaurants in London. Quality and flavour is very present at this restaurant. We started with our starters and first to arrive were our satay seafood and thai fishcakes in lovely wooden stands. The skewers consisted of squid and prawn, all very fresh and plumb. They cooking time was perfect to retain it's juices for that ncie bouncy texture. The satay sauce was also housemade, generous with the peanuts so it nice and chunky. Some can be quite sickly but they got the flavours just right on this one. I would have preferred if the fishcake was more thicker so it had a better bite but for what we got it was very good, also plumb and bouncy and seasoned well. It also tasted freshly made and not fried beforehand like some I've have. My Tom Kha soup was also delicious, fragrant of coconut, creamy and with a lot of depth from the generous ingredients used to give it's different notes of flavour. There was a good amount of heat to it, not burning but enough to get your tongue buzzing. With such a successful round of starters we were really looking forward to the mains. First to arrive was our impressively large char-grilled seabass served whole. I always love my fishes served whole and it is the authentic way to serve fish in the oriental cuisine.The seabass was prepared well, seasoned beforehand so the flavours really came through. The skin was perfectly crisp, seabass fresh so it was very flaky and moist. It came with more fish sauce but it really wasn't needed as it was already well flavoured. The spice was mild but I liked it that way.My favourite had to be the lamb shank. The fat must have permeated the meat as it was lovely and tender, sweet and juicy. The thai red curry sauce itself was also lovely, not synthetic but creamy with a hint of sweetness. It really well with the lamb shank adding a more buttery texture to the already soft and moist meat. It also came with some side vegetables of plain cooked carrots and broccoli which was I was dipping into the sauce. It made the dish less heavy which was very thoughtful. We also ordered a veggie dish of \u00a0sweet and sour fried vegetable.I was disappointed that the tofu wasn't fresh though but the frozen quality where there was more skin than the soft silky tofu itself and instead chewy and dry. The rest of dish was great though, generously portioned and an abundance of fresh vegetables beautifully cut up and the sweet and sour made it all very appetising. With that I had the garlic whislt my boyfriend ordered some Thai sticky rice. I wish they used the Thai fragrant rice variety but instead it was more long grain rice. But my garlic rice was still very pleasing, not too oily and subtle hints of garlic so it's not overpowering the mains when accompanying them. But my boyfriend was really disappointed with his sticky rice as it was over steamed in the bamboo container it came in so became very dry and chewy. It was near impossible to separate the rice so he left his unfinished. But overall the meal was fantastic and a high appraisal on the level of cooking and the attention to detail. Food presentation was amazing, each presented like a piece of artwork with the use of vegetables to colour each dish and the portion generous. The menu was greatly decorated too in a nice cover, extensive but I do recommend having more unique dishes different to the other hundreds of Thai restaurant in London. Service was friendly and although English was none of their first language it made the meal feel more authentic. My boyfriend funnily enough ordered milk and as confused as they were they still catered it and presented it in a very nice cappuccino cup.With just little improvements needed in certain places l I can see this Thai becoming more popular as it is already getting very good reviews. It is in a weird location on Brick Lane market but its not like it has any competitors nearby.",

My friends bass was also yummy according to her (I didnt try it because it had 3 chillis next to it lol). And their prices are very reasonable. Definitely try this place if youre in London!!",

    "text": "This place was really a great find as good Thai food is hard to come across here.First, you need to make a reservation for something like a Saturday night, which luckily we had. During our dinner, quite a few couples and groups showed up to eat, but were turned away because the restaurant was entirely booked for the night. There was also a large table (12 or 14) in the back celebrating a birthday, which probably contributed to the business.This restaurant is quite authentically decorated. Lots of dark wood, beautifully hand carved, and very heavy! The chairs and tables are clearly real wood. I liked the ambiance because it was quite different than what I'm used to in a Thai restaurant in that it wasn't trying to be modern, but more old school. Nice change of pace.The wait staff is dressed in uniforms inspired by Thai culture and they are super polite, helpful, and accommodating. I will say the restaurant was really cold when we went, which was exacerbated by the fact that we were sitting right by the outside window. They tried to put a space heater right next to our table to keep us warm. Unfortunately, the space heater was broken, so it wasn't a help, but I appreciated the effort.We ordered Kaeng Kiew Wan (Green Curry) and Pad Kra-Prao (Stir-fried Basil).Green Curry - your choice of meat or veggies/tofu. We ordered veggies without tofu or mushrooms. The veggies that came were broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, long beans, eggplant, bell peppers, onions, and potatoes. They indicate spice level with chili peppers and this was level 2 (out of 3). We requested it milder, which I think affected the taste a bit. It wasn't amazing, but I think if tried the traditional way, it would've been more flavorful. Still, the portion was good and the variety of vegetables was refreshing. Basil Stir-fry - this also came with a choice of meat or veggies/tofu and we requested the same as above: veggies with no tofu or mushrooms. This was indicated to be 3 chili peppers (as spicy as they have on their menu) and at the time I ordered it, I indicated that I wanted it verrry spicy. It definitely came spicy, but I would've wanted a touch more. Also, prior to ordering it, I asked if it was sweet at all. Some basil dishes have so much added sugar, I wanted to double check. She said this wasn't sweet at all and that there was no sugar added. I will say it still was a tiny bit too sweet (and I'm not sure how else it got sweet other than sugar/corn syrup or some equivalent), but the flavors were otherwise great, so we happily ate it. This dish was definitely better than the green curry and had the same vegetables, except for eggplant and potato (which don't belong in this dish, so I'm glad they didn't come). At first we didn't spot any broccoli, which is one of the veggies we specifically requested, so we brought that to the server's attention. He immediately gave us a small side of broccoli to add in, but then we realized there was broccoli in there already (albeit only two pieces)! Point being, they were very accommodating. I was definitely get this dish again (requesting less sugar and more spice) and would absolutely try another one as well.We ordered two sides of rice since it doesn't come with the entr\u00e9e. The rice was brought out in a leaf shaped bowl, which was charming. A somewhat decent portion, but could have been bigger still. We ended up ordering a third between the two of us and had about half of that left over.Very happy to have found this place. Will definitely be back and I do recommend that others give it a try!",

It was our first visit to Brick lane and although the area does look very run down and almost a bit rough there appeared to be more Indian restaurants there than we have seen anywhere else. We chose the Kinkao mainly because it was the nearest to our car and we fancied a Thai meal. The staff were very polite and friendly and were happy to advise us on popular meals. We chose a mixed starter and although in the Thai language it looked very unusual in reality is was Spring Rolls, Sesame Prawns, Chicken Satay and a few other snacks. The Stuffed Chicken wings were something we hadn't tried before but it was excellent. Our main course was sliced beef in vegetables, Chicken and cashewnuts and rice. We had drinks with the meal followed by coffee and the whole lot was about \u00a345 for two - excellent value. If you do go to Brick lane for a meal then we recommend you take the time to explore the area, it is quite interesting! Great for young people with lots of outside bars, clubs and casual eating places.",

I ended up eating rice and curry separately because both were soo good and I couldn't bring myself to mix them;) Only the service is not very consistent and varied from a friendly welcome to a very shirty treatment when we couldn't immediately decide on the type of rice we wanted. Therefore only 4 stars from us.",

The smell of the cooking food was almost too much to take and we were starving by the time it got to us. The food itself was just about perfect.I haven't found anywhere that matched that so far but this place did come close. We intended to go for an Indian as we were in Brick Lane but when we passed this place it looked beautiful with lots of decorations and fruit carvings in the windows.I convinced my partner to try this and it was a good decision. The food was delicious, I had the crab for starters and a sea bass for the main course, my partner had the chicken satay and a cashew nut curry for his main. The bass came on a wonderful raised metal plate with a candle inside either to keep it warm or to make it look nice!The food was probably the second best Thai I've had, after the beachside restaurant in Pattaya. Our bill with drinks included came to just about \u00a338 for the two of us so while not as cheap as in Thailand, it was definetly good value for money here in London.If you're looking for a good place to have a Thai meal I don't think you'll be disappointed if you choose to come here.",

Located at the top of Brick Lane, towards Shoreditch High Street end, it is not a far walk from the market or Old Truman's Brewery. The staff are dressed in traditional Thai outfits and and very friendly and helpful. The decor is really quite splendid as well, with statues of buddhas and a wooden, carved archway in the middle of the restaurant. To start with, my partner and I shared a mixed starter and this was such value for money!! For \u00a312.50, we got satay chicken, sesame prawn toast, thai fish cakes, fried dumplings, spring rolls, chicken wings, prawn roll ups and some crispy deep fried pasta type thing, with three sauces (one being the satay one). It was soooooooo tasty!! And I was amazed at how much we got for the price that it was considering that one starter was around \u00a35-\u00a37. So if you come here, then definitely go for the mixed starter option!For mains we shared a Panang with Duck, Garlic Rice and Pad Thai with Chicken. The curry was extremely delicious and full of flavour - I literally could not stop eating it! And the Pad That was great! Sticky and sweet but then you get the nuts and the basil and the chilli. Great. It was soooooo good that we couldn't actually finish it! But I totally loved it all. I will totally be coming back here!",

    "text": "I loved staying in Shoreditch while visiting London because of all of the international cuisine options. I knew there had to be a Korean place nearby, and Kinkao was right around the corner from where I was staying. The inside of the restaurant is much bigger than expected from the outside, with lots of seating areas. I made a reservation for lunch at 1pm but it wasn't really needed; there were only two other people there at the time.I wanted to try the oi kimchi (spicy cucumber salad) but they were out, so I got regular kimchi and bulgogi as an entree. The kimchi was perfect; nice and spicy and crunchy. The bulgogi was more peppery and not as sweet as I'm used to, but I overheard my server telling another customer that they prepare it a little differently than traditional bulgogi. It was still very good and there was an ample portion of beef mixed in with glass noodles and veggies. It was so much food that I wasn't able to finish it all.The prices are very reasonable and my entire bill was about \u00a318 (I also got a Diet Coke and large still water). The service was friendly, but a bit slow, especially considering by the time I left there were only three parties, including myself. After my dishes were cleared I waited about 10 minutes but still had to ask for my bill. It wasn't a huge deal because I wasn't in a rush, but I thought it was odd that the bill wasn't brought out shortly after my dishes were taken away.Either way, this is a good, affordable option if you're looking for Korean food in the area.",

Many of the reviews for this restaurant seem to be for when it was a top rated Thai restaurant- alas- it seems that since then it's changed ownership and is now a very poorly run Korean restaurant. The staff there are unfriendly, poorly trained and seemed flustered when more than two tables were filled. It took us 30 minutes to get our water, and when we asked to see if they were bringing them, the owner got snippy and went off to stand in the front of the restaurant instead of helping to bring them out or check on the status. On top of all this, the food isn't even good. I normally dislike giving a place one star reviews since there is usually one thing redeeming about most places, but this place was really a disappointment. I got the bulgogi bibimbap which was flavorless and bland. My brother got the ribs which were completely drowned in marinade and my mom's kimchi soup was spicy, but without flavor. From having a confused menu, awkward furnishings and terrible treatment from the staff as well as the owner, I recommend looking for food elsewhere.",

Starters are served in small tower dishes, which are great for groups! It's fun; it's different. Evenings are great for date night, when they'll accompany your table with a small lit candle.We were surrounded by customers ordering oodles of noodle dishes (which all looked amazing btw). The rebels we are, our main Pad Ped, a wok chicken red curry, was looking equally flavorful, embellished with a suede vegetable flower. How delightful. ^^Between pineapple ice cream in a pineapple slice and layered desserts, we dove through their 'hot bananas in coconut syrup', to which, I'm going to stop you right there and suggest you order something else. It can be *very* filling and quite honestly, overwhelming. My hubby is bananas for anything banana. Or coconut. ...Or mango! Okay, another discussion for another time. But the strong flavors of the stewed bananas can be tiring after a few bites; and gooping an entire bowl-full? Well, I'll commend you for finishing it if you could. We preferred the simpler savoury pandan leaf pancake stuffed with delic crushed coconut.The portions are a la French, but... If a beautiful evening and dining experience at affordable prices is what you're looking for, then this is a great place to try.Book reservations to sit in the back with better lighting.",

There is an really good selection of different types of rice (sticky, regular jasmine, coconut, garlic, etc)The decorations are really cute actually. The chairs are super heavy (in a fun way) and it is nice to see a restaurant go all out and give the place an interesting environment. The staff are quite nice and service is not too fast or too slow. I had a great time!",

We started with a duck appetizer, that's essentially an inspiration from peking duck - it was okay. My boyfriend just wanted to relive his memory in beijing. We then ordered a Thai red curry and PAD KEE MAO, both with chicken. The Thai red curry was watery and not very flavourful. The pad kee mao was delicious, but not enough noodles (heavy on the thai basil flavour). The chicken was perhaps the biggest flaw of the whole experience. They were chicken breast squares with no flavour whatsoever. If i had to come back here, i'd go for the pad kee mao with beef, and ask them for extra noodle. But I likely will be scoping out other thai places before I come back here.Prices are reasonable. about 7-9 GBP a dish. I've had better, but I've had much worse.",

Admittedly you feel a little bit like you're stepping into a cliche of a Thai restaurant with all the solid wood decor and the amount of bowing that our traditionally dressed server sent our way before shyly ushering us towards one of their heavy tables inlaid with intricate decorative carvings. This is really no bad thing though - it gives the place a more cosy and welcoming atmosphere and we just had to smile at our pint-sized waitress, she looked far too happy to be there. Of course, there are other benefits to sticking to the theme, namely in the shape of Chang beer. Food-wise the thai red curry with prawns was wonderfully spicy, whilst we also added a stir fry dish with chicken, mixed veg and cashew nuts. I think we chose well though it was a tough choice as the menu is a lengthy (and tasty-sounding) one. Portion sizes are also decent and one rice was enough for two to share. Be warned that it all arrives eerily speedily too!Good for either casual or nicer dinners as prices are quite reasonable. If you're in a group it's probably best to book ahead as it was quite busy on a weekday night when we stopped in - so they must be doing something right! A long way from Khaosan Road then but still nicely tasty :)",

    "text": "How did we stumble upon a Thai restaurant on Brick Lane? No idea. To be honest, we barely knew what we were doing. Before we arrived at Brick Lane, we didn't know that it was a hub for authentic Indian and Bangladeshi restaurants. However, when my boss saw the work \"authentic\" in the sign for a Thai restaurant, he pulled out his Yelp app, saw that it has 4.5 stars and exclaimed \"let's go,\" channeling Princess Peach from Mario Kart. Thankfully, my boss' technique of picking a restaurant worked. The food was all really tasty and the place was beautiful. All of the furniture, d\u00e9cor, and tables were gorgeous and there was a lot of wood-carved furniture that created a lovely, warm atmosphere. Is it bad that I was also a huge fan of the waitress' uniforms/outfits? They reminded me of Indian saris.We ordered the mixed appetizer plate, which was good, but since we had no idea what item was what, I think we all preferred if we had ordered a couple of main appetizers rather than the mixed plate - this is personal preference though. We also ordered the aromatic duck appetizer and it was really good - the duck was flavorful and tender - I would definitely recommend it. For my main course, I ordered the lamb shank in a red curry, which was so delicious and flavorful. It had the right amount of spice and the lamb shank was so, so tender. I was a huge fan. Make sure you order a side of rice on the side since the dish doesn't come with it and it helps scoop up all of the curry! My boss ordered the full sea bass and also loved it - he said it was extremely moist and flavorful. Warning: it's bone in! The tiger cry also look delicious.For dessert, I ordered the coconut ice cream served in half a coconut shell and it was so refreshing and light - the perfect end to the meal. It tasted homemade and was the perfect ending to this AUTHENTIC meal.",

The food was mediocre, something to fill you up and probably a good enough lunch option but not a place you would come back to. I'm not sure if its success is based on the fact there are no other Thai options nearby.Based on food alone i would give it a 3 star, but the attitude of one of the food servers was horrible. We ordered some tea, but the cup was sticky like someone left sweet chilli sauce on the outside. When we politely told this server, she snatched the cup and yelled out to the kitchen with a condescending tone as though this was our fault. And then we never got a cup back. All the Thai places i have been too always have the most friendly service and i am quite sad to say this place was horrible at best. To be fair it was only the one person that was rude and condescending all the other staff were lovely.",
