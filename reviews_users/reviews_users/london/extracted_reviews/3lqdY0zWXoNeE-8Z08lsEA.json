The pizza all looked delicious and the cooks in the back were shouting Italian so I knew it was legit. I got the prosciutto pizza which lacked somewhat in the cheese department but it was more like a bit of tomato sauce and lots of ham on toast but it was still delicious. Also they had Pelligrino Aranciata in a can - like orangina - amazing. Definitely recommend stopping by if you're around Notting Hill looking for something to nosh on.",

Still the place is always bustling and its a great place to pick up a snack on the way through to Portobello Markets... or after too much drinking!",

Arancina is as real as the deal gets in London- the pizza tastes amazing- thin crust, bursting with natural flavours and served by the slice. The downside is that it's at least twice as expensive as in Rome! Still- for a fiver you get yourself a decent home-cooked meal (they also do fantastically tasty pasta/ lasagne/ Italian roast chicken with the yummiest roast potatos!) and friendly service. It really is a little slice of the real Italian 'Pizza al Taglio' experience. You know it's great because half the people who eat here are Italians.Also highly recommended are the 'suppli' and 'arancino' which are balls of risotto with a filling made of mozzarello and tomato (suppli) or cream and mushroom or spinach and ricotta and then deep fried in a breadcrumb batter!

The small orange rice balls - a Sicilian delicacy -give the cafe its name. Upstairs is a great hideaway from the bustling market, with big bright pictures of Sicily across the walls and newspapers at the coffee table.The prices seem a little excessive for the goods, even if they do taste great, but I guess that has something to do with being situated in Notting Hill. I really wish they'd bring back the piano they used to have downstairs. It was brilliantly eccentric to have a guy playing piano hits in a takeaway cafe. If I could have him and his Queen hits back, Arancina would be complete!",

The coffee and pizza are excellent, the pizza is served in large rectangular slices with lovely italian toppings, think rocket, pancetta, chilli, egg. I'd also recommend the deep fried rice balls after which the place is named. They are quite rich and fatty but a nice guilty pleasure. There's another branch just by the junction of queensway and westbourne grove which is much the same so it looks like its a pretty succesful little business. In conclusion, a little bit pricier than your average little cafe, but great food that is easy to eat on the go and worth the extra cash",

They have quite a selection of pizzas and are very understanding when you waltz in, slightly buzzed from consuming vast quantities of quality rum, and ask for one of everything and a side of pasta. Actually, even sober I'd probably do that in a group just because the variety of pizza is brilliant.I couldn't really tell you which one was my favourite as I was busy shovelling it down my gullet with copious amounts of red wine (small selection but some pretty easy drinking bottles). The base, which all pizza should be initially judged on, is soft on the inside but crispy on the bottom and edges which gives a fantastic mix of textures. The pizza toppings all tasted very fresh which is surprising given that it was around 8pm on a Sunday night but they did seem to be quite busy.The rest of the place is pretty standard, just a collection of tables and chairs. Of course you can't miss it given the signature mini car in the window decked out with food. Now that's my kinda ride!",

Don't get me wrong, it was really delish and a great deal, just not 5 star fabulous.This place's reviews, I've decided, are victim to \"OMG this is SO AMAZING, I AM TOTALLY DRUNK, so this is the best pizza I've EVER had in my WHOLE LIFE\" itis.The next-morning memory of it is better than it is in reality.

Especially on Fridays and Saturdays when they're open from 7:30am to 11pm, Arancina sort of works around what you're doing at night in Notting Hill. They have a very cool car in their window so you won't miss it and some sort of other transport (I'm assuming) to provide takeaways throughout their opening hours. For a light bite the pizzas are some of the best in the area and if you want something more hearty they do lasagne and the like and you can take it upstairs where they will throw it in your face for a laugh. Not really; upstairs there are tables and chairs so you can sit down, relax and enjoy good and genuinely authentic Mafia food.",

Mind you, a very crowded friends house (and your friend happens to make amazing pizza).The place can get crowded, and the space at both the counter and upstairs is limited.

Each piece was more flavorful than the last.Although it doesn't look like it, there IS seating above the restaurant up the stairs where there's about 7 or 8 tables that look down on the street as well. I caution that eating in while increase the price of your overall meal.The restaurant is in a great location right off Baywater street so you won't be able to miss it. Enjoy!",

Yes, it sits there and gradually looks worse and they pop it in the microwave- but it tastes wonderful! That was incredible pasta!!!!! And the pizza was very interesting- it has asparagus- but they called it creamy asparagus, which is was. Don't ask me how.

I've been wanting to try it out for ages, but I normally try and avoid high carb places like pizzerias. Having my sister with me, allows me to justify, (in my mind) a visit to places like Arancina that I've been longing to try out.This location has a small space downstairs where the pizzas and arancinis/arancina? \u00a0are on display in counters. There's just one tiny table for 2 to stand at, but there is seating upstairs.The pizza (mixed meat) was excellent. I could definitely go back for more. Thin crust, a lovely sauce, not too much cheese and lots of meat. They were very light to eat and the rectangular shape makes them easy to manage without spilling toppings.The coffees were fantastic. (latte & flat white).I'm not a big fan of arancini and the broccoli and sausage meat one that we tried, didn't inspire me to try any more.I'll go back for sure, but I'm sticking to pizza and coffee.Oh, and I also picked up the mini biscotti at the counter, that were amazing!",

I was pleased the cheese here was of quality and was it melty, bubbling, had a bite to it which I love. You can easily share the smaller sized pizza with one other and even better you can each select toppings of your choice as they'll gladly accommodate a half/half. Prior to the pizza we shared a spinach and ricotta arancine (fried risotto ball). It was too bad this dish fell short in the taste department! It was the driest of arancines I've ever had and it was tragically bland. The worst part, the center was still quite cold. Perhaps we visited on an off night. A dipping sauce could have easily remedied its shortcomings, I thought. But I guess this would be a cop out since the flavors of the sauce will take over what you're really supposed to be tasting - the arancine. I'd come back but next time I'll be skipping the appetizers and go straight for the pizza.",

It's a tiny traditional Italian-style take away and it serves some of the best pizza in London. There's also a restaurant upstairs if you need a sit down.I usually come after drinks in Portobello as it's up the road from Notting Hill Gate, perfect for calling in on. All the pizzas are displayed under a glass counter and when you see them you'll want a slice of everything. Favourite Italian combinations are available such as aubergine and parmesan, spinach and egg, and they even have Pizza del Lattaio (with thin slices of potato on) that you'd find hard to find in an Italian restaurant let a alone a take away. You get a big rectangular slice and the bases are thin and crisp, done the true Italian way. Plus, as the name suggests, they do arancina's (large rice balls cooked in saffron filled with filings such as beef ragu, ham and cheese or spinach) that are served alongside pizza in Italy, but never over here. If I'm craving pizza after drinks in the West then this is the only place that offers a real slice of the Italian Job.",

Great eye-catching stunt they pulled off there!Needed a super quick bite before taking on a walk across Hyde Park and onto Victoria for Billy Elliot, and grabbed some pizza here. Uh.... very nicely done! Still not quite fan of square slices, as they are wholly reminiscent of grade or secondary school for me. But being a sucker for cute things, I just had to try!",

The quality is great and the staff is very friendly and always happy to give you a few tasters before making your decision. Definitely give it a try. There's seating upstairs, quite cool if you want to take a seat after a long walk in and around Notting Hill.",
