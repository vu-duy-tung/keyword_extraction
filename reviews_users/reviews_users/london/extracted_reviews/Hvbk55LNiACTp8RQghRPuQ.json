But being well known with many people around the world it is no surprise there is a queue. I waited for 1 1/2 hours for a table of four but happy to as we could go away for a drink and wait for them to text us when a table was ready.Ippudo currently has to be my favourite ramen restaurant in London as the flavour of the broth is the best. But only downside is the ramen does not come standard with an egg and you have to order it as an add-on. An interested add on to the ramen is the curry ball which is a small curry paste ball served separately. \u00a0Add it to your ramen and it instantly become a tasty curry broth ramen. You can order one portion and share between two or three people as a little bit is enough to infuse a curry broth, \u00a0unless you prefer a strong curry broth.As well as ramen there are a range of appetiser to order including gyzoa and even Ippudo version of fish and chips. Then to complete a ramen meal you can finish with a range of Ippudo desserts. Yum!!!",

The total price was 35 pounds, which I thought was really expensive for ramen.... but it might be a normal price for London. The tonkotsu broth was good, the eggs were seasoned nicely, Kyuri's sauce was okay but might need some more strong taste. There were many staffs enough to take care of the customers and they were all nice and lively just as I see in ramen places in Japan. The place is cleaner than Japanese ones, which is good. I also recognized some Japanese staffs.The only problem is that it is not really a cheap eat here in London.",

It's not going to blow your mind, but it will be good enough that you're not walking away disappointed like you would from so many other ramen shops in London. This is probably because it's a Japanese chain. They know how to make their ramen and this bowl is pretty comparable to the one I had in NYC from the same chain. Unfortunately, the pork buns are not nearly as good. I think they are doing something different here (more mayo in the sauce perhaps?), but I guess you have to get one if you've never had one...they are good, just not AS good. Solid 7/10 ramen, but pricey and very limited on their other items.",

However when you turn up at Ippudo it feels like it's another commercial franchise restaurant. Saying that the staff were still extremely polite. I started with a few Hirata Buns, the filings were tasty, slightly lacking on size and you can get better elsewhere. I also really like spice so went for the Karaka Spicy Men ramen. Personally I thought it was over spiced and it did start to over power the very flavoursome broth after a few mouthfuls. They also catch you out by providing a basic ramen and then you have to add toppings to complete it, making it overpriced for what you get. At least throw an egg in. If you are a traditionalist there are definitely better Ramen restaurants in London, but it is still OK to check out if you are passing by and need some quick comfort food.

Ippudo even had fish & chips and steak, with a twist though. I ordered the \u00a310 student meal which was so good as it included a bowl of ramen, a portion of gyoza and a drink. Usually the ramen is already over \u00a310 on its own. I shared this with my friend and we ordered some hirata buns and desserts to share. The broth was rich which was tasty but different to Ippudo, the buns were fluffy and the gyoza had golden crispy skin on the outside filled with juicy, meaty filling.The staff was friendly and helpful and all the staff would always greet you when you arrive and when you leave by shouting out Japanese words such as 'welcome' and 'thank you'. Think this is a Japanese restaurant cultural thing but can be awkward as I assume most people here wouldn't know what to say or even what the words mean. But overall it's a great ramen bar in London. The broth taste richer and better than Shoryu and has a wider menu than Kanada-Ya. I would definitely go back!",

Ippudo is up against serious contenders.The ambiance was just as I remembered it in New York, slightly brooding and sexy, if you could call a ramen house sexy. \u00a0I arrived on a Friday night at 6 pm ready to get my noodle game on and was surprised the wait was only about 20 minutes for a table of two.Once seated, I ordered my usual, the Hirata Buns for 7 quid and Akamaru Modern for 11 quid. I always thought the Ippudo's prices in New York were hard to swallow (or slurp) but I guess they're a bargain compared to their prices in London. \u00a0I've never been impressed by the Hirata Buns, and I still uphold that opinion. They're okay, and very minimalist compared to other buns I've had.The NOODLES. One thing Ippudo has always excelled at is the noodles. No one can do springy and sleek when it comes to noodles like Ippudo. The bowl was kept simple, with fair portions of pork belly chashu, bean sprouts, mushrooms, and spring onions. The broth was a bit too salty, and this is where I think Bone Daddies is slightly stronger- keeping the broth's flavor without compromising saltiness.This is the only ramen place in London I've finished everything. The portions are just right and satisfied the craving without making me feel like pork fat was seeping out of my pores. Definitely coming back, but boycotting the Hirata Buns.",

I went for their signature ramen, the Shiromara Hikata Classic. This is a tonkotsu pork broth with a piece of pork loin. The broth was fine, but had a subtle greasy aftertaste. I wanted to eat something else to balance it out. My wife had one of the special spicy ramens. The noodles were a bit overdone for her, but she does prefer them to be a bit under.

In fact, we when twice to Ippudo during our stay in Kyoto and we also went to Ippudo some days later in Tokyo. We also tried Ippudo at NY East Village. The menu in the London restaurant is similar to the Japanese one. And the food is also excellent! I found the noodles just slightly worse in comparison to the previous times. However, there were a couple of differences in comparison to the Japan and NY restaurants that I didn't like at all. First, the restaurant does not have the cozy ambiance I found in Japan and NY. In fact, the restaurant looks like a modern restaurant difficult to identify with the traditional japanese dishes. Second, the service was kind of bad. The waiters were anxious to retire our bowls and they seemed to be depress. Just the opposite I found in Japan and NY, where the waiters were enthusiastic and speaking a much more credible japanese!Overall, I gave 4 points just because I am always willing to reward nice ramen (which unfortunately is still difficult to find).I am sure that I'll be back to NY's and Japan's Ippudo restaurants... but it seems unlikely I'll be back to Ippudo London in my next trip to the UK.",

They insist \"it's store policy\" but sorry policy for what? I've been to ippudo Tokyo and Shanghai, no one did that! Or maybe special policy for London? Sorry other London restaurants are never that rude to customers!",

Friendly and kinda personal but not really. Although service is better here than most places. Anyhow unfortunately I didn't order the ramen, which was rather tasty. The gyuzo was good and the edimame was the norm. I had a black cod which was nice but far from the best portion I have ever had, although reasonably tasty if I was on a diet. The sapporo beer was excellent, shame I couldn't have a few more. Maybe a place to come again, although there r so many Japanese restaurants to try.",

The place is extremely fake as in a \"wanna be\" because employees there spoke crappy Japanese phrases (almost to the point it should be considered as mockery). If you're going to speak it, learn how to speak it correctly! There is nothing more annoying than having 10 staff members shouting the same thing over and over again when entering and exiting the eatery. In terms of the food, I think that eatery was just half arsing everything - especially being very stingy on the chashu. This is another type of chain eatery that is out there to rip off people that don't know any better. I would avoid the place at all cost. I know ramen places are scarce in London but please don't go in there out of desperation. It is not anything like what you'd get in an authentic ramen place in Japan, San Francisco, Los Angeles or New York.I would never go back there for sure. I hope more ramen places will open in London where people wouldn't find ramen to be such rare or exotic food but instead evolve into just a normal food option (sit, eat and out).",

Well after queueing for around 15mins (even if timed your arrival directly on opening time), expect to be greeted with a Japanese welcome into the restaurant by every single member of staff you pass (frankly I feel sorry for the staff who have to keep chanting this greeting all night long), then you will be seated and served by people from all walks of life. It would seem that for most of the staff, English is not their first language, which is fine until you find yourself slowly repeating your question in order to elicit an answer. Nevertheless, the food was nicely presented, the noodles sufficiently succulent to be memorable and the variety available from the menu was decent. The portions are quite small but this works out well if you want to try out out a full 3 courses. The food does take quite some time to arrive but you can tell that attention has been dedicated to its preparation. Ippudo has a little more style over substance but all in all, a worthwhile visit and an original experience.",

We had the pork bun and gyoza, the bun was really good but gyoza didn't really impress me. We had two different Ramens both very tasty, but they don't come with an Egg unless ordered as an extra, I was left a little miffed having ordered it but it then turning up without it.... I couldn't be bothered to wait so went without. The service was very good the waiter knew the menu and made good recommendations. I'm still to try the place opposite that has some glowing reviews but I would certainly be coming back.",

I've never had ramen in London on account of better more classic things to eat but I have had ramen from Ippudo's original locations in Tokyo as well as other gold standards like Ichiran. All in this ramen was pretty excellent and as advertised. The only thing that took this place from 5 to 4 was the service and the ambiance. The service was kind of slow- they told us to pick a bunch of combo menu items as that was technically cheaper than the a la carte items we ordered but then some of them didn't show up and we had to ask for them. The other issue on ambiance was that tables near the front and the kitchen started to smell sewer and when that happened staff would wash a bin worth of soap water down the floor drains in the kitchen which fixed the sewer gas issue but made the area smell like chemicals. Until this is figured out try to sit in the back. Despite this the food itself was great.",

    "text": "In my PRD (pre ramen days), Cocoro was virtually the only place in London which served proper tonkotsu ramen. Then, I headed to New York on holiday and came across IppudoI still remember that epiphany with my first slurp of the creamy, salty, fatty broth and I was in love. My initial sadness on returning to ramen-less London has been tempered over the last few years by the wave of specialist ramen restaurants opening across the capital over the last 2 years. While London still can't match the breadth of ramen restaurants compared to places like the Bay Area, I think the best of London (Bone Daddies in my opinion) is pretty good these daysHowever, I did get a pang of nostalgic excitement when I heard that Ippudo were opening in London. I hurried down there last Sunday to see if they had brought their A game to LondonThere was a small queue at 7pm but the 30 minute estimated wait time I was give turned out to only be 5 minutes. I like the Japanese greetings shouted by the staff as you enter the restaurant even if it did seriously irk one of London's more popular bloggersI went for the Akamaru Modern, where the basic tonkotsu is augmented by garlic oil and Umami Dama paste. I added a seasoned boiled egg. My ramen arrived commendably quickly in one of their signature small based bowlsIt was an excellent bowl of ramen. Fantastic stock. Not too much bean sprout filler (I'm looking at you here, Shoryu). Soft pork with nice rim of fat. Chewy noodles. Perfect yolk on the egg. Ippudo slips into second position behind Bone Daddies in my table of favourite ramen places in LondonThe menu is currently smaller than the one in New York but it's a good idea to start small and expandWelcome, Ippudo!",

    "text": "Went for the grand opening on 10/10/14. We've been to Ippudo in New York (East Village and Midtown West) and Japan (Kyoto) and I want to start off by saying that the ramen was just as good as what we've had in both other Ippudo branches. Consistency is what we are looking for when it comes to Ippudo and the London branch totally delivered. Out of the popular New York ramen places (Ippudo, Ivan Ramen, Hide-Chan, Totto, Minca, Yuji) Ippudo is still our favorite for ramen though we love Yuji's mamezen.Anyway, I digress. When we found out Ippudo was coming to London we knew we definitely wanted to go. The space is really gorgeous, with floor to ceiling windows on all sides of the two-story restaurant. We didn't get a chance to see the upstairs but they have an open kitchen with bar seating for 7 as well two, four and large group tables on the ground floor. Luckily, Adam was able to be at Ippudo by 6pm and had been told that it would be around a 30 minute wait. It was the grand opening so there were some kinks, though I'm sure with time these will be resolved. As we waited for our table at the bar, we noticed there were two bartenders but the service was incredibly slow. It took over 30 minutes for my cocktail, the Shogalicious (\u00a37), which consisted of aperol, fresh grapefruit, ginger and lemon all topped with prosecco to be made. We actually got seated before I received my drink. Totally a staffing/opening day issue as much of the time was spent finding ingredients/finishing prep work that I'm sure will be fixed but something to mention. However, we found that once we sat down service and wait time for food was much less than at the bar. In terms of the drink, it was quite refreshing and had a great ginger taste. Worth the wait (sort of). If you aren't interested in waiting at the bar, they are able to call/text you when your table is ready so that you can go to one of the places nearby for a drink instead. The bar is quite small and narrow, with seating for less than 10, so it's nice that they have this service for those waiting. By the time we were getting seated, the hostess was letting people know the wait was over an hour. Still better than New York's 2+ hour wait!We were seated at the bar that looked into the kitchen; however, the seats and bar were lower than the open kitchen so you can't see the whole cooking process (if that is something you're interested in). The menu has some items that we hadn't seen on the New York menu and the two that really piqued our interest was the tako wasabi (\u00a33.80) and the homemade pickles (\u00a35.00). The tako wasabi consisted of raw baby octopus with freshly chopped wasabi (two kinds) and was fantastic. The portion is small, so I would recommend that each person order one. The octopus was fresh and went well with the two kinds of wasabi. We quickly gobbled this up. The homemade pickles (konbu-dashi pickled tomatoes, celery, radish, cucumber, pepper and lemon paired with a sweet plum wine jelly) was the only miss of the night. So... odd and just wasn't the kind of pickles we would have thought of when one thinks Japanese. We had assumed that it would be tsukemono, such as takuan (yellow daikon pickle) and kyurizuke (cucumber pickles), but what came to the table resembled more of a crudite platter in terms of the way the vegetables were cut. The konbu-dashi pickling just wasn't to our taste, a bit too sugary and vinegary reminding us more of an Italian pickle than Japanese. Lastly, the whole cherry tomatoes had a very odd texture. Of course, we had to also have the signature Ippudo Pork Hirata Buns (\u00a37). Just like home. They tasted exactly like what we had in New York and brought us back to nights at the East Village Ippudo. The pork belly was tender and flavorful and went well with the slightly spicy mayonnaise while the lettuce lent a bit of crunch. The soft and slightly sweet bun was a perfect vehicle. We could have eaten 5 of these but had to save room for ramen. They currently have 4 types of ramen, with two being vegetarian broths. Our favorite from New York was on the menu, the Akamaru Modern (\u00a311), which we both ended up getting. We hadn't had ramen in such a long time that we decided to go a bit topping crazy and both added a seasoned boiled egg (\u00a31.50), seasoned bamboo shoots/menma (\u00a32.50) and takana leaf mustard (\u00a32). This was heaven. The noodles were cooked so that they still had a bit of bite and the broth was rich and so satisfying. The The seasoned boiled egg still had a slightly runny yolk, which is exactly how we like it. The bamboo shoots were good and added some crunch to the ramen. The takana leaf mustard (which came on the side) added some \u00a0spiciness to the dish and Adam loved how salty it was though it was a bit too salty for me. Ippudo was exactly as we remembered from New York. What you crave on a cold winter night and where we will be weekly through the cold and wet London winter.",

    "text": "I love Ippudo in New York, by far the best ramen I ever had. I am glad that I can finally enjoy the finest ramen I know in Europe.I had a pork bun and the seasonal shoyu ramen. The bun was delicious and really opened my appetite!When the Ramen arrived on my table, I couldn't wait to try them. The broth is simply delicious and is perfectly balanced. The noodles are also really delicious. I haven't find any other places that has noodles even close to Ippudo. However, I have to say that the pork was not as good as in NYC. It wasn't bad at all but I was expecting something more tender and tasty.Overall, this is a great ramen place but the price tag is probably a bit exaggerated. I paid 22\u00a3 for one person. I will probably go back but will need to find a \u00a0cheaper place for my usual ramen craving",

    "text": "Modern interior. With music to fit the bill. Not a whole lot of space. They announce the number of guests in Japanese and everyone is then greeted in Japanese when you walk in which gives it that authentic feel.I've heard it can be busy, but there was no wait at 10 on a Wednesday night.I got the Hirata pork (3 \u00a3)In a steamed bun like the kind that goes with Peking Duck. Tasty piece of pork belly with a lightly spicy sauce. Overall pretty good if not a little over sauced.Akamaru modern (11 \u00a3)Not too spicy at all. Broth is rich but seems heavier than the consistency would make it seem. \u00a0On saltier side for me. \u00a0The noodles are the thin style ramen noodles which are different if you're expecting the regular thicker ramen. \u00a0They give you a decent amount of noodles, but it was a little on the harder side for me.Poached egg (1.50 \u00a3)You have to add your own egg. \u00a0You can get a boiled egg, but of course I got it poached. \u00a0It was actually too soft for me. \u00a0I had it in the spoon and it actually kind of fell apart sitting in the spoon.Their way of asking for more noodles is kind of interesting. \u00a0You ask for more noodles (1.50 \u00a3) when you are almost done. \u00a0They warn you that you must keep enough broth in the bowl for them to add another serving.Overall I'd say 3.5 is about on. \u00a0The pricing is a bit higher due to having to add a lot of the extras yourself. \u00a0The thinner noodles are a taste thing. \u00a0Very cool interior though.",

    "text": "I have been to a ippudo in NYC, Manila, and Singapore and though there are some variations in the offerings, the service was good. HOWEVER, the IPPUDO at \u00a03 Central Saint Giles Piazza; \u00a0St. Giles High Street, London has \u00a0ATROCIOUS service. After a 30 minute wait ( not unusual of ippudos), we were seated and after waiting another 15 minutes at the table, I had to get up and go find my waiter to take our orders. Our waiter 'Eric' took the order which was large sake, 4 waters, 2 ORDERS ( 6 pieces) of pork bun appetizer, 3 Karakamen ramen (2 with medium noodles and one with hard noodles) and 1 Shiromaru Hakata classic Ramen (medium noodles). and after 20 minutes he hadn't even brought our sake or water. So I got up and went over to him and then he proceeded to bring the water. \u00a015 minutes later, someone from the kitchen showed up and brought 2 PIECES of pork bun. I asked him what happened to the other pork buns and he said that the waiter only ordered two buns. So I called our waiter Eric over and told him that I ordered two orders of pork buns which is six pieces as exactly I had explained to him however he just didn't seem to get it. \u00a0The pork buns were quite anemic with the pork filling. 95 % bun and 5 % filling. This is not the IPPUDO that I know. Also, I had ordered Karashi takana to put in the ramen but that never came until later in the meal I had to ask another waiter for it. When our ramens came, I asked him which one had the hard noodles and he said \" it doesn't matter because they are all the same\". WHAT?? I looked in my ramen bowl and it had mushy soft ramen noodles. I told him that I wanted hard noodles in my Karakka Ramen. \u00a0 He really didn't seem to care. \u00a0I know that in other parts of the world, ippudo takes pride in the quality of the food as well as customer service, however, London's Ippudo clearly does not follow that \u00a0philosophy. \u00a0The waiter than suggested he will just bring some hard noodles which I can dump in my Ramen. WHAT?? So what am I going to do about my mushy soft noodles that are sitting in the ramen bowl mixed up with everything else that is in the bowl. The noodles don't just come out so easily without the other elements of the ramen coming out with it. \u00a0 \u00a0 I told him that was unacceptable and I just want the Ramen noodles that I ordered. \u00a0All in all, it was a very disappointing Speary and's having been to multiple other ippudos around the world. \u00a0 \u00a0If you have been to other Ippudos around the world or in your own home country, do not think of this Ippudo as being related to the one that you have been to \u00a0in your own home country or at other destinations. This is clearly a very substandard ramen noodle restaurant. \u00a0I have not been to other Ramen restaurants in London but I am absolutely certain that there are other Ramen restaurant which would for outshine Ippudo. This was an extremely disappointing experience, one I will never repeat again. \u00a0Save yourselves the anticipation, excitement, or hype of an IPPUDO in London and go eat at any decent London restaurant whatever ethnicity the food is. I can't imagine the service to be any worse than this or the food quality to be such a disappointment. TRUST ME, it is just NOT THE SAME IPPUDO that you may have been to in your own home countries. Save your money. Enough said.",

I like the fact that there are a few japanese people to overlook the kitchen so although sometimes the ratio of toppings, soups, and noodles are not really perfect, the taste combination is mostly there. The soup is very solid with pork and seafood combination and noodles are cooked and drained off very well.I saw some comments about bone daddies, etc... In my personal opinion, this is not even comparison... This is a solid japanese ramen and many other ramen places in London are japanese style ramen.., come and eat here if you want a solid bowl of ramen.I also had a bowl of rice with was - very descent. Loved the rice - was cooked very well with quality grains. Rice actually tasted better than many other japanese restaurants in London. Quite impressed.Truly a great addition to the London \u00a0japanese scene. The real test would be how this quality will be maintained without the special supervision that had been shipped in for the opening.",

    "text": "I have been to Ippudo in New York and was really eager to check out their new London restaurant, having tried a few of the ramen establishments here like Bone Daddies, Shoryu, and United Ramen. My friend and I originally decided that we would show up in Holborn and decide between Kanada-Ya and Ippudo on the spot, depending on which queue looked better, as they both don't take reservations. So when we arrived and saw 10+ people waiting outside of Kanada-Ya in the cold on the street, Ippudo was the obvious choice.Luckily, on a Monday night the wait was not that long, and I put my name down for an estimated wait of 15-20 minutes. They do the same thing as The Ship where they take down your cell phone number and then say that they will text you when your table is ready. The problem is that it didn't work so well since that when the table was ready, they came over and called out my name, and meanwhile the text message system was not notified so kept sending me texts saying that my table would be ready soon, including after we had already left the restaurant!At the bar I ordered a pint of Asahi and an order of the pork hirata buns. I was served right away and the buns came only a few minutes after I ordered them, so you don't have to worry even if you only have a short wait for a table. It was spicier than I had imagined, but the pork was tender and fatty, and it was very tasty. Unfortunately they are 2 for 7 pounds, and at that price I'm not sure if it's worth it. We paid for the food and the drinks right away, as they said that it was difficult to transfer the tab to the table since the bar and the restaurant operate separately.Once we were seated, service was extremely prompt and they came over almost immediately, expecting us to know what we wanted. There is actually quite a large selection of appetizers but only four ramen options, two with meat and two vegetarian. As we had already eaten a bit, we went straight for the ramen. I got the classic Shiromaru Hakata and my friend got the Akamaru Modern, which has garlic oil and a special red house paste. It was a solid bowl of ramen, though it did not come with an egg and there wasn't the option to add crushed garlic or sesame seeds, which is an option I find myself expecting at these specialist ramen establishments. I tried my friend's Akamaru Modern, and it did indeed have a much stronger kick to it, if that is your type of thing.I like that they don't mess around with the ramen and just serve a few classic dishes that they are good at. What I don't understand is the vibe of the restaurant, which tries to be both traditional Japanese and a cool trendy place at the same time. It is in a modern glass multi-use building in the center of London, but yet while we were being seated, the not-Japanese hostess kept shouting welcomes in Japanese and the staff would echo in Japanese when they too were mostly not Japanese. The decor is also not Japanese and the music playing was an odd blend of pop and dance tunes, with some memorable songs by Jesse McCartney and Miley Cyrus.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to this since visiting Ippudo in Japan, I mean REALLY REALLY looking forward to it. And what a disappointment.tldr: Food was good, service was appalling. Won't be coming back.In Japan, Ramen bars are a local grubby place where all that counts is the food - which is 99% of the time just amazing. Even chains such as Ippudo have this kind of authentic charm to them that I couldn't wait to live again in London.Well, they tried to recreate the charm, but they also added some false pompous poshness. It didn't work. At all. And it just turned it into a bad customer experience: something you wouldn't ever find in Japan.So note: you can't book a table, and you can't be seated till the whole party is there. Fair enough, they need a quick turnover. But again, this method doesn't fit with the sense of \"posh\" they are trying to convey in this place. So we ended up waiting at the bar, having some bar snacks and starters while waiting for the queue to grow, and grow. We finally get seated 20min (after receiving a text notification) after all our party was there.The menu is pretty simple, and offers a bit more variety that what you would find in their Japanese restaurants. Prices are acceptable, similar to what you would be paying in other ramen bars in London.And well, this is what saves them their 2 stars: the food was actually pretty decent:- The Gyoza were fantastic- The ramen was as it tasted in Japan - never been a massive fan if their noodles, but their broth is fantastic.My other half went for the spicy ramen, and added the extra spice, and went for the x15 spicyness. But beware: it is lethal. He loved it, my mouth was burning by just dipping my finger in it.We decided to skip desert and paid the bill. Wile we were just saying goodbye to our friends when one of the managers came and asked us to leave. That was pretty much the last straw.Ippudo London? Been there, done that. I'll go and satisfy my ramen-craving needs somewhere where I am not treated like kettle, thanks.",

She held it up with her chopsticks and I said is that just some noodle? Nope, it's like those strings you get when you buy raw chicken, and it's in her ramen. WOW.We waved a waiter over, who saw that and promptly took the bowl away apologising all the while. In the interim another 2 waiters came along and apologised again. One of the waiters offered to replace her bowl of ramen and any extra she wanted for free. Nice gesture, though we were already full (unfortunately she was near the end of her bowl of ramen before this \"discovery\").The food is mediocre, the soup stock was nothing special. Coupled with the ghastly experience, I am going to stick with Kanada-Ya.",

I ordered the Akamaru Modern and shared my friend's gyoza. I wasn't amazed by either. The gyoza was made with chicken, and I would have preferred pork. If you're coming to a ramen restaurant famous for their tonkotsu broth, wouldn't you want to continue the pork theme? The flavor of the ramen was fine, but gave me MSG dehydration afterwards.I appreciate that Ippudo is rather new and they are keeping the menu (at least with respect to the ramen) quite simple. London has many other options for ramen and I would have preferred some specials.",

I tried plum wine for the first time. \u00a0Sweet! I liked it.To start we split the chicken karaage and the chicken gyoza (not the deep fried or boiled but normal pot sticker style). \u00a0Both were flavorful. \u00a0Then I had the basic Tonkatsu Ramen. \u00a0It was really nice. \u00a0Great broth, tender pork and perfect chewy noodles. \u00a0My coworker had the vegetarian ramen, with egg added. \u00a0He said was really good. \u00a0He also had the tempura chicken to go on top of the ramen (since all the meat ramen issues are pork based and he is Muslim). \u00a0He said it was really good.Overall, glad we went. \u00a0Service was fine. \u00a0Nothing amazing, but the guy was friendly and we got what we needed when we needed it. \u00a0I would totally go back again.",

    "text": "I was reminded today of why I love Ippudo. This is the fourth Ippudo location I have dined at, and the ramen did not disappoint. All of the dishes Ipuudo is known for were on the menu. \u00a0Plus a few UK-inspired ones. Up until today, the most memorable Ippudo ramen special I ate was the black sesame oil miso ramen in NYC in 2012. \u00a0And today it was knocked off of it's pedestal by London's current special, Red Tan-Tan Men. In short, Red Tan-Tan Men is the most unique and best ramen I've ever eaten. EVER. ****IF YOU CAN HANDLE SPICY RAMEN, THEN ORDER IT WHILE YOU STILL CAN**** The special just became available yesterday and is available through the end of June 2016. The wait staff believe it to be available only in London because each chef at each location comes up with their own creation. \u00a0Read on if you want the details... THE BOWL: white in colorTHE NOODLES: As usual, the straight noodles were perfect. (You have the option of getting it hard, medium, or soft. \u00a0I chose medium.)THE TOPPINGS: (1) cilantro, or coriander leaves as they are called in the UK, was... a first for me to eat w ramen; (2) chili oil has a nice mild-medium kick; (3) a poached egg comes on the side, which is meant to be added to the broth; the whites had the texture of silken tofu, and the yolk was a creamy soft boil; (4) 3 fried wontons are small, and have chicken and vegetable filling, and usually come in the broth, but I asked them to put it on the side (because I hate soggy fried anything); (5) spicy nikumiso paste, which is SUPER SUPER SUPER \u00a0spicy (!!!); luckily the waiter warned me, so I asked for it on the side (so that I could control the spiciness of my broth) my best guess is that it is made up of ground pork, miso, and very spicy red chili oil. \u00a0(6) sweet vinegar (comes on the side in a bottle) which is meant to be added to the brothTHE BROTH: First of all, this is a CHICKEN BROTH, not a pork broth. So the flavor is obviously different, but it has a similar level of \"depth\" as the pork broth minus the greasy feeling on your lips. Also, there are instructions on how to \"layer on\" the toppings to achieve different broth complexities. \u00a0Here is how I ate it:(1) first try the original base soup... It's rich in flavor and has a mild-medium spicy kick from the chili oil. (2) the instructions tell you to add the nikumiso paste next but since it was so spicy, I decided to do it last and, instead, added in the egg next. And OMG it was amazing. It gave the broth a nice creamy and silky texture; (3) then next came the sweet vinegar. I was nervous about this one since I didn't know what to expect. So I only added a little at a time as I ate. But wow did it made it even more amazing. It was just the right acidity and sweetness. Sweet, sour, and salty all in one bite. I was I heaven; (4) then finally came the nikumiso paste. \u00a0I've made the mistake of underestimating spicy paste before (rendering it inedible), and I never wanted to ruin another ramen bowl ever again, so I'm really glad I asked for it on the side, because it was way to spicy for me to add it directly to the broth; so I asked for a small empty bowl, which I used to \"dilute\" the spiciness by adding a little bit of broth. \u00a0I semi-drained the ground pork in small batches throughout the rest of my meal. This required extra work but was worth it to me because it was even more delicious. \u00a0There is a recommendation on the instruction card to add rice to your broth at the end. But I didn't try it, since the noodles were so good on their own. \u00a0Does it need additional toppings? Well, the wontons provide a nice crispy texture to contrast the rich creamy broth. I wish I had more than just 3 wontons. But in terms of adding the other toppings (seaweed, onions, chaushu, etc), no, I felt it was right just the way it is.e",

For our main, of course we decided to take one of the many ramens offered. I don't understand how anyone can come here and not eat the ramen! It was a difficult decision and in the end I decided on the spicy tonkotsu and my husband ordered the London Exclusive. Both were excellent.The service is holding me back from giving a fifth star. We had to wait for our table, so we ordered two drafts at the bar. My drink was almost finished when we were seated so I went ahead and ordered my next drink which never arrived. Once I finished both courses (starter and main) he came over with my drink but by then it was too late! So definitely order a big drink from the start, because it's the only one you'll get during your meal!",

    "text": "Having first tried it in Kuala Lumpur, we were truly excited to when Ippudo finally opened its first store in London. We actually visited back in December 2015 so the ramen and food might be slight different. We had two of their hirata buns: their classic pork bun with signature soft braised pork belly and chicken katsu bun. A little slice of iceberg lettuce adds a nice crunch to the dish, otherwise you'd literally feel like you're eating air since the bun is so soft and fluffy! A thin layer of mayo and a special chilli sauce combines everything together. A must try if you go to Ippudo!Next we tucked into the lovely ramen. Each came topped with 2 slices of their famous tender pork belly, spring onions, kikurage mushrooms and a dash of black garlic oil. Don't be put off by the garlic oil though, think of it like when you add a dash of sesame oil to your stir-fry - its an added level of fragrance to the dish!First up is the Akamaru Modern (\u00a311.00) - Ippudo call this their \"bolder \u00a0translation\" of their classic pork broth, as its got their secret special blended miso paste (fermented soya beans).If you like miso, then this is definitely one for you.Second, we had the Karaka-Men (\u00a311.00) - Ippudo's original tonkotsu broth with a blob of their spicy miso paste. Definitely not for the faint hearted. The depth of the chilli really hits the back of your throat, yet it's not too overpowering as you can still taste the intensity of the pork broth.A meal wouldn't be finished unless we had dessert too! We opted for the Houji-Cha Pudding (\u00a35.00). This was a smooth milky-like pudding, similar to the pana cotta. The pudding is flavoured with roasted tea and topped with a layer of sweet kuromitsu sauce (black honey). The whipped cream on top is flavoured with honey. Nothing we've ever eaten before, so slightly weird, but oddly satisfying! Personally we think Ippudo ramen reminded us the ramen we've tried in Tokyo and Kyoto...",

They have a great system where they text you when your table is ready so you can go somewhere else to grab a drink if the bar is full. \u00a0The wait actually turned out to be one hour and we were ready to eat.Food: For appetisers we ordered the amazing pork hirata buns which are just as amazing in London and the hirata chicken wings which were good, but very peppery. \u00a0We chose the Hakata Shiromaru Classic (added an extra egg) and the Akamaru Modern ramens. \u00a0Both were deeeelicious!Drinks: We ordered one glass of the Ichinokura Tokubetsu Junmai sake. \u00a0(We ordered two beers and one glass of wine at the bar on a separate tab while waiting.)Price: 53.44 GBP for two people.Ambiance: The restaurant is pretty big (two floors) and has a ton of energy like the one in NYC does. \u00a0We sat downstairs at one of the communal tables.Service: The service was very efficient. \u00a0I mean spot on. \u00a0But it didn't feel like you were rushed in any way. Everyone was super friendly from the hosts, the server, the food runners, etc. \u00a0I was very impressed because you don't usually get good friendly service in London.Would I go back? \u00a0Definitely! \u00a0It's a taste of home for me. \u00a0I am so happy that finally both Ippudo and Kanada-ya are here in London to show how ramen is really supposed to be served.",

    "text": "I had a great experience at Ippudo. The wait on Wednesday night ~7pm was about 20 minutes which we gladly spent at the bar. I don't drink alcohol, but the bartender was kind enough to whip me up his own virgin mocktail creation - lychee, strawberry, calpis and fizz...it was the cutest drink (and very yummy). We ordered the karaage (fried chicken) and the pancake as starters - yum! We were pleased with both. The chicken portion isn't the biggest and comes with only about 4-5 pieces, but it's very tender. The pancake was gorgeous and still piping hot on the pan.I got the regular white bowled tonkotsu ramen (I don't remember the full name of it...but it's the first option on the menu) and was very pleased even if it's simple and straightforward. Do ask for sesame, crushed garlic, and chili oil to add into your ramen. The ramen is the thinner kind, and you can tell it's real fresh. When we entered, everyone shouts Japanese greetings at you....and when you leave, everyone shouts Japanese goodbyes and well wishes. It's kind of endearing.",

    "text": "Fabulous dinner stop on a rainy Monday evening. My younger sister has only moved to London a few weeks ago and still somehow managed to scope out this place before me. Her description of it sounded so tasty that I insisted she go again and take me!Anywhere with a roof would have been welcome shelter after sploshing our way over from the bus stop, but this place was particularly nice to enter, with the glow from the gleaming wooden interior visible through the glass frontage. We arrived at a quite early 6.45pm so were happy to wait when she said it'd take about 20mins for a table. They have one of those systems that texts you when your table is ready but given the rain we weren't going anywhere fast. We pulled up 2 high chairs at the bar instead and enjoyed the decor around us with ramen bowls on display overhead and dried noodle squares set into the counter. We both like plum wine in Japanese places so ordered Plumpop cocktails - prosecco, plum wine and orange bitters with a strawberry.Before the barman had finished making them though the front-of-house came over and asked if we'd mind counter seating; we didn't, so could be seated then. We walked round to a row of seats lining the kitchen, so they all face into the chefs' food prep area, and are suitable for solo diners or two's. Our cocktails followed us and were delicious. Food-wise we were too intrigued by other parts of the menu to order the traditional ramen which seems to be the specialty here. Instead we went for a chicken hirata bun each, which was so tasty that next time I might just gobble 5 buns myself for a meal. For main, we shared a Japanese savoury pancake stuffed with pork belly and cabbage and made with their pork broth, and a sizzling pot of noodles with minced chicken and tofu. Both were incredibly hot (in temperature) but the flavours were delicious (once the feeling in my tongue returned).Our server was very friendly, and they make an effort to speak a few words of Japanese to say thank you and bye which I thought was a nice touch. It's probably on the pricey side for what the food is but it's a swish little setting right in the middle of central London so I think much as expected. Best for smaller groups or date night I think; the hardest part was resisting nabbing one of the big red ramen bowls on the way out - my sis definitely had her eye on one to use at home!",

    "text": "Excellent soft opening. I've had Ippudo in Japan, NY, and London. \u00a0And I can honestly say, this is way better than the experience in NY. \u00a0There is a strong energetic, welcoming feeling as you enter the glossy restaurant. \u00a0The chefs and staff are yelling \"WELCOME\" in Japanese so often, you gotta wonder when they have time to cook. \u00a0All of the servers/staff were well trained and did their jobs with alacrity and care for my experience. \u00a0I pretty much forgot I was in London.I ordered two different ramens: Hakata (white, comes in white bowl) and the Akamaru (red, comes in red bowl and comes with red paste and seasoned oil). \u00a0The base of the two ramens taste similar, but the red was a bit preferred this time (probably due to the red paste and additional seasoning oil). \u00a0The pork was outstanding--thick and delicious and really not as fatty as I've experienced in other places. \u00a0If I were to get an \"extra' for my ramen, a soft boiled egg (which is an art unto itself) is always a good and worthwhile add-on.Asahi Dry draft (a pilsner)--excellent and cold as should be expected. \u00a0I also ordered a Kale Salad to see what they were doing with it. \u00a0Usually Japanese restaurants have very fresh, well prepared greens and great dressings. \u00a0I'd say the Kale salad with fruit, nuts, and sesame dressing did not disappoint. \u00a0I won't be thinking of it in my sleep or craving it, but if you're looking for a superfood addition, this will do more than fine.You may be going with your work buddies or on a cool date, but the ramen is good enough that it may take you to a solitary space for a few bites. \u00a0Good ramen demands introspection, thought, appreciation as you bring your face close into the bowl to inhale and slurp politely. \u00a0Sometimes the simplest things are the hardest to do (well).I haven't tried ramen anywhere else in London, but I can say this blows away the New York Ippudo by good measure. \u00a0This restaurant is beautiful and spacious and the ramen actually tastes close to Japan (and is a lot less expensive than flying out there). \u00a0Great experience at Ippudo--congratulations on building a new dining experience in the UK.",

    "text": "I can't believe I haven't reviewed Ippudo yet, but maybe it's a subconscious thing because I don't really want to share it? It's the best ramen in London and I have a hard time finding ramen I can have as ramen is usually made with pork broth, but Ippudo makes a fantastic vegetarian broth that is so damn good it is better than some chicken ramen broths I have had in the past. This has become one of my favourite places in the city and there is nothing better than a hot bowl of steaming perfectly chewy yet soft noodles on a chilly evening. I always add the egg, which comes cold but if I let it sit in the broth for a little while, I get a perfectly melty center that is yummy. The tofu is not my favourite but the bean sprouts are delicious and I find that I can never make it to adding extra noodles (it's an option for people who have leftover broth they want to use) because I always finish what I have. There is also a really lovely chicken hirata bun appetiser here that is fluffy bun goodness with teriyaki flavour. The gyoza is also some of the best I've had and is steaming hot and perfect. I once had the fish and chips appetiser here and although it was well-made, I would say it is actually way too filling and I was actually really sad when my ramen came and I was too full to have much of it. They don't do takeaway so don't make that mistake. The iced green tea was also too strong for me, and the fried chicken appetiser was nice but not my favourite. The ramen is basically the star at this restaurant and it's a well-deserved title. The decor here is glam with its gorgeous chandeliers and yet somehow cosy and comfortable at the same time. I would warn you that the waiting time can be long if you come on a Saturday night, so come early if that's your day.",

It's the same delicious thin noodles we all know so well, on par with the quality of the Ippudo in the Bay Area, not as good as the one in New York, but an ideal option for those hunting for a ramen fix in a fairly busy area saturated with chains and cafe food.Go \"hard\" on the noodles, as they'll soften over time. Tonkatsu is a good starting point, then go from there. If you're feeling extra hungry, you can always add more noodles to the soup. Bonus: this area seems to be pretty good about getting folks in and out, so typically no wait! Nioce!",

Each of us was impressed with our selection.My ramen had a thick pork broth with a slightly spicy garlic sesame oil. The broth held its flavour and the egg was cooked just right, medium boiled. Noodles were served as requested, hard. It was an excellent portion size. My partner enjoyed his bowl, having the poached egg served on the side along with hot sauce. His broth was slightly milder and boasted pulled pork. They have a decent drink menu if you fancy sake, cocktails and mocktails. Although it's an international chain it's easy to see why they have been successful.",

I thought that the staff was friendly, the food was served quickly, and the noodles were of good quality. It's a great alternative to busier ramen shops in the area, and it's comforting to know that this is so nearby. There are a few different broth offerings and different than the NY menu--the London menu seemed more extensive, with a number of hot dishes, appetizers, and a decent sake/wine/beer selection.",

    "text": "Set behind Tottenham Court road station Ippudo is a Japanese Ramen and beef restaurant that is great for a quick stopover if you are in the area. First there is no way to book this restaurant. This was OK for us as we were just popping in following a visit to an exhibition. We waited at the bar with its snazzy noodle counter which would look amazing at night. We \u00a0helped ourselves to some Sparkling Hana-Fuga cocktail Sake. For the price per bottle we got two champagne glasses worth. I suspect that this is the alcopop of Japanese sake with its sweet fruity taste. We both did enjoy it as it went straight to our heads even with a 5% alcohol content. It took around 20 minutes for a table to become free and we were seated in the rather cavernous interior. This place has top to toe windows but it lacks some of the character that you would expect from a Japanese restaurant. However as there were quite a few Japanese people dining here I suppose this is acceptable place to eat. We decided to go for the Ramen. I had the shiromaru classic with an egg which is called something else and cost more. The waiter asked how I wanted the noodles. Soft or hard. Being a bit of a weakling I took the soft option. I also ordered a cha su pork bun. This was very satisfying. The bun was soft and somewhat doughy, the pork was glazed in a sweet syrup and went well with the mayonnaise and lazy salad leaf that had been tucked in. When the Ramen arrived the egg was on top uncut. This was a bit of a surprise.. had the cooks become lazy. It did spoil the picture I took but hey ho it was still quite tasty even though probably pre-cooked. The soup had a strong pork flavour and went well with the chashu, sesame kikurage mushrooms, bean sprouts, bamboo shoots and spring onions. I gobbled it down but I think I have had better a few weeks earlier. To down all the food we ordered some sake. I love the chilled variety which is cloudy and easier to drink than the paint stripper sake which is considered finer. We had no room for dessert. One thing I found lacking here was the lack of display. Servings were carried out on rather bland plates and glasses. Much like the place it lacks real Japanese character. Room for improvement I think.",

    "text": "Better pork than Kanadaya, but kanadaya has better soup, noodle or egg in my opinion. Ippudo's soup is also rich and flavoursome, but it starts to leave the salty feel in the mouth afterward which is not very pleasant. You can also customise the hardness of your noodle to however you like, and the noodle is thinner than that in kanadaya. However even when I ordered 'hard', I find it too soft to my liking - perhaps I should have went for 'extra hard' due to the thinness of their noodle. Overall still a very pleasant experience at Ippudo, but I personally prefer kanadaya.",

    "text": "I will note that I may be used to a more fusion/Americanized version of ramen and Japanese food, but I was incredibly disappointed by the quality of the food as well as the preparation. The chicken karaage was mostly squishy yellow fat, and the pieces so undercooked that the breading was barely crisp on the outside, and it was legitimately raw beneath the surface. I had to literally scrape away blobs of raw batter off the minuscule pieces of chicken, which lacked marinade and seasoning. Inedible in my opinion. The ramen also left much to be desired. What was advertised as having many vegetables, came with 1 baby corn sliced in half and some bamboo shoots and anemic bean sprouts. The broth was thick and tasty, but the noodles were mushy, limp, and lifeless. All in all, a disappointing meal, except for the rose green tea. So they've perfected the art of tea, but the two major staples like ramen and karaage have left me disappointed, especially at the established price points.Would highly recommend going to an indie ramen shop in Soho than this chain restaurant.",

Fine food, but I'm not itching to return here. I much prefer the nearby Kanada-Ya, even with the much longer wait.Basically, if you're not that picky about ramen and are looking for a quick bite in a spacious (quite beautiful, actually) restaurant, then Ippudo is right up your alley. But if you're a ramen fanatic, then this might not be the place for you.",

Oh, and don't forget to add the nitamago, it will elevate your ramen experience for sure.",

The pork broth is juicy, ramen are thin and perfectly thin plus you can get a poached egg instead of the classic soft boiled egg. Also the chashu pork is a bit thicker which gives an extra touch to the whole combo.But I would come back to any of them any time!!!",

When you have to pay extra for an egg *cough cough* bone daddies * cough cough * Saying that...Ippudo isn't inexpensive. A ramen and pork bun (singular) will set you back ~\u00a318. Nice place for a casual dinner or a date. Turned up a little late, they didn't let my friend sit down till I arrived?? Meh Ramen: 8 spicy boiled eggs / 11Pork Hirata Buns: 17 sesame seeds/ 21Atmosphere 6 DJ Khaleds / 10. ....but then at 8pm the restaurant started playing some dope tracks. Another one after another one. Atmosphere bumped up to 8/10. Overall a good experience, tasty food. Would recommend if you're looking for a ramen joint and don't mind paying the extra buck. Would I go here again? Yes. Would I order a f*ck load more pork buns. Yes. Yes I would.",
