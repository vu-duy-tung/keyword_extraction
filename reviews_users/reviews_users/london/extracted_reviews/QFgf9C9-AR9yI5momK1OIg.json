It's a very large, busy bar but the drinks are reasonably priced (especially if you drink wine by the bottle) and the atmosphere is good. It's clean and tidy, as you would expect from a Wetherspoons pub. Nothing really stands out about it but it's a good place to stop for drink during the day when out shopping and a great place to start the evening if you're going on to a local club or something later on. I've stumbled out of this place more times that I care to remember. What I especially like about this bar is that it caters for all, whether you have waist length plastic hair or a short back and sides.",

It seems very touristy, maybe, or like somebody tricked these people into going out in Camden and they needed to keep their destination as un-Camden as possible. In an area with good music and interesting things going on, this place just bleeds dull. But, again, the drinks are cheap, so bottoms up!",

Set right next to the Camden Lock, you can catch the actual lock in operation as boats pass through. The interior is quite large and has a very pub-like feel, though on the weekends the music takes over and people have been known to throw down a groove or two.The best part about Llloyd's Bar is the fact that it's a small pool of normalcy in a part of London usually commended for its weirdness. You're guaranteed okay bar service, good food and drinks at the right price. Go during summer after a Camden Market shopping spree and you'll have made a great decision. This pub is also perfect for the family outing with a menu that caters to the kiddies as well.",

Its location is cool, right next to the lock so you can take in the calmness that being by water brings, but it is still quite busy and has a lively atmosphere. Space is not an issue, the place is quite large and on my visits my friends and I have had no problems finding a table. In fact we quite enjoyed the booth style seats which were against the wall as it felt like we had a degree of privacy.Being a Weatherspoons however, The Ice Wharf lacks character. It is like a clone of so many of their other establishments around town and doesn't make the most of the Camden vibe. Compared to other places in Camden, it just feels a little bland. On the plus side, it does mean that you know what you are going to get and provides assurances about decent quality food and cheap drinks.Its location also makes it an ideal spot for either taking a break from shopping in Camden Market or as a meeting spot for gig go-ers at the Roundhouse up the road.",

I have said on a few occasions, that shopping really isn't my thing unless I'm shopping for food, so the ice wharf is where I reside and wait for her to finish, have a drink, or even a burger.On a sunny day it is perfect, as there is plenty of outdoor seating facing the canal. You can sit and watch the odd canal boat go by, and watch the people of Camden walking across the bridge. On top of that, they have real Ale!!I know that the Ice Wharf is open till late, I have only ever been there to have a few drink with a few friends first and then head out to wherever we are going. I wouldn't really imagine spending the night there, but I know people do. Due to its size and prices, I can fully understand why people do.I myself see it as a day venue, they serve a great platter with potato wedges, onion rings and all the rest, and it can easily fill two people.",

If the weather is good then you ought to sit outside on the tables or, as we did, stand on the canalside watching the barges 'zoom' by.

There is a younger and less 'eccentric' crowd than many pubs in this chain tend to attract. But the pub has a dark side. Every full moonI meanweekend it is taken over by an unfriendly and aggressive group of bouncers who make getting in and out of the pub a dangerous experience. I was lucky enough to be merely pushed to one side because I was stood in the way of one of them and something.probably his next fight. (I actually only saw them punch one personbut then I was staying out of their way after I realized what a menace they were). I couldn't believe quite how unpleasant they were so I checked around on the internet and it seems a lot of people have taken issue with it. If you don't wish to incur their wrath, take off your hats and wait patiently to get in boys and girlsand you might be lucky. Or you could decide that you want a fun night out without a side order of flexing arrogance. I really want to give it a 1 star for being so blind to the gang of thugs they have hired for the door.but during the week this is a nice place to come and the staff behind the bar were very friendly..so begrudgingly I give it 2 stars. I will never ever come here again on a weekend. That much is certain.",

Just don't expect Michelin standards and you won't be disappointed. You can get a good hearty meal, a beer and a chaser for less than \u00a310. That sounds like a good deal to me.

I really love the seating plan, you have your own space but still feel part of the cozy atmosphere. The prices were still competitive regardless of how many tourists flock to the area.

Anyway, my friend had an obsession with a particular brand of organic cider that he swore made you giggle when you drank it. Knowing it was a Wetherspoons, I thought the closest we'd get to it would be fizzy, sickly Magners, but lo and behold, they actually did stock it. Unsurprisingly, my friend was right, and after a few bottles sitting in the sun, we were giggling away like schoolgirls. I can't say much else for the atmosphere or service at the place as we only sat outside and drank this one drink.

You can't argue with the prices though. The reason I have given this particular branch 4 stars is because of it's setting. The pub is in the heart of Camden, right on the lock, overlooking the canal on the opposite side of the Camden Lock Market. There is quite a large outside seating area, with great views of the lock. Watching the barges manoeuvre through weeping willow trees on a nice sunny day, is something I never tire of enjoying.The pub itself is huge with a long bar, lots of tables and booths, plus an elevated seating area. Like the other Wetherspoon pubs, there are no stools at the bar. I'm sure this is to make sure the area is clear to just encourage the area to be used for serving purposes. Shame as standing/sitting at the bar in a pub is something I usually like to do when I'm enjoying a pint.I usually come here on a Monday morning, after I've finished my weekly shop. What I really like is that they currently offer a bottomless mug of filter coffee for just 99p. You can have as many refills as you want up to 2pm. It's Lavazza coffee, so not too bad.This pub has the usual Wetherspoon traits, like no music, tv with no volume showing only news and theme nights such as curry club, mexican etc.I don't think that I would come here in the evening, as I think the prices encourage drinkers who our out on a mission to fill themselves up with cheap booze before moving on to somewhere else, and it does get rammed, especially at the weekend. For the moment I'm contenet with my 99p bottomless coffee, and probably the best view you can get in Camden. That alone is worth a 4 star status.",

    "text": "Horrid service! Rude waitress with a draconian demeanor pacing the outside seating, which had tons of seating, demanding no one sit there who wasn't dining. My mother had the chicken, I went next door had the sushi and was going to seat next to her. Literally a handful of diners outside and this troll forced us to leave. The sushi place gladly let us sit and eat.Paying customers shouldn't be treated this way. Especially tourist, in a heavy tourist area. Also the food was bland and clearly just heated breaded chicken out of a freezer bag.I highly recommend that if you're on holiday steer clear of this painfully rude establishment!",

I can't imagine how good of a deal it must be during happy hour!! \u00a0It was pretty much self-serve, though someone was cleaning up after the tables. \u00a0It took a while for them to clear our table, but we had to grab it once we saw people leaving because then we would be joining the crowd comfortably standing in front of the bar. \u00a0The next person waiting on tables was much more attentive and even offered to take our orders so maybe floor seating is meant to be service, or at least for food. \u00a0We didn't mind grabbing drinks from the bar since it was quick anyway. \u00a0There were a ton of people inside and outside the pub, but the noise level was still perfect. \u00a0It made for a great atmosphere with great drinks, accompanied by awesome company.",

    "text": "Located on Camden Lock, this place is easy to miss. I have been staying at the Holiday Inn for a few months now and never realised this Wetherspoons was here. It was a Tuesday night, so it was steak night. I ordered the 14oz Angus Steak and spoiled myself with a side of Peppercorn sauce and some onion rings. I also had a pint of Coors light. The whole thing came to a whooping \u00a312. This is why I love Wetherspoons, when eating out in London i tend to find the prices are insanely high for some of the most common foods. The service in here was typical Wetherspoons. You come in, find a table, take a note of the table number, approach the bar, order and give your table number. The food arrived after about 15 mins, and was actually decent. My only criticism is that i love my steak blue. They refused to make it blue, so i settled for rare. To be honest this was no deal breaker for me. The food overall was pretty good for what i paid. I really felt that i got great value for money. The server at the bar was really friendly. The atmosphere was also a typical Wetherspoons, people where talking at a reasonable volume, with no music in the background. I will have to visit here more often, considering its a perfect location to my hotel and the prices are very cheap, even for a beer. The service was good, but i imagine that was due to it being a Tuesday night. I dare say weekends will be demonstrably different, but you should expect that everywhere you go.",

The service was very friendly and had the usual weather spoons menu and offers. The pub is a mix of Camden locals and tourists as it is just across the water from the lock market which makes for great people watching. My food came quickly and as I expected. Nothing fancy - just a solid chainpub in a good location.",

They do serve food here, but we just stopped by for after dinner drinks. The service was a bit slow at the bar. They do have a wide selection of Draft and bottle beers as well as full liquor bar. I ordered a bottled Becks but as soon as I took the first sip, realized it was only slightly cold. Definitely not nice cold like a beer should be. Didn't bother going up to the bar to switch it out. Overall it was fine to stop in for a quick beer but not the most amazing place I've ever been.",

You can enjoy a beer or a cocktail sat in a small place but without chatting because the music is so high or you can go dancing on the small dancefloor near the bar. Unfortunately I did not enjoy all night because there was a suspect device under the Camden bridge and we were evacuated. However I think I will go once again.",

    "text": "I come here occasionally because of where it's situated, on the lock, with a big outside seating area that makes it attractive during the summer months.The inside is OK- it's quite big and the crowd is rather mixed. Nonetheless this place is buzzing. You must, must bring ID and you may even get ID checked at the bar (we were)- as the bouncers and the staff are very vigilant for underage drinkers. The alcohol selection is vast and they serve your standard pub grub if you're in the mood for some stodge. Just a heads up- the toilet cubicle doors have a translucent pane over them which is slightly weird, not to mention off putting (for me anyway). The staff are quite friendly- the guy who served us messed up my order quoting me a different price than expected. Instead of making me pay more he let me pay the price he told me in the first place. \u00a0If you're into cocktails, however, I would give this place a miss. While they do indeed serve cocktails, most of them are only available in pitchers (for a decent price), I wouldn't expect any expert mixology here. The cocktails are standard gin and juice, slightly sickly and a bit of let down. It's fine if you're looking for something cheap but after having sampled a cocktail here I would've rather settled for a good old beer.",
