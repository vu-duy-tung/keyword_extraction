Is utterly spectacular and a really fun place to go on a special occasion. The cheapest bottle of wine is \u00a324 but it was fantastic! We had the wildebeest and the buffalo and both steaks were excellent. The service wasn't great but we ordered a dessert cocktail and the bar man came and lit it on fire with much fun and fanfare. A really good night out with extraordinary food. And if you have a taste card you get 50% off food on a weekday - mind you, the bill was still \u00a380.00! Still, fantastic and definitely worth it if you fancy dressing up and the decor is amazing :)",

    "text": "This was my second visit to Shaka Zulu, and for the second time I was impressed. Clearly inspired by the success of neighbouring restaurant Gilgamesh, for me the establishment's second best asset (after the food) was its stunning decor and ambience. On a cold November night, it was a joy to step into a warm, spacious environment where our group could munch its way through tasty biltong (South African-inspired dried meat shavings) and all manner of game meat (including ostrich, kudu and springbok) without fear of being drowned out by music or noisy conversations on nearby tables. If you are vegetarian, I suspect you'll be disappointed by the menu, despite the options available to you. Shaka Zulu really is a carnivore's paradise, and avoiding the meat dishes is bound to leave you feeling as though you've had omelette and chips at the most classy Chinese restaurant in town. Talking of chips... Theirs are the best around. The peri-peri coating is so moreish that you're unlikely to settle for just one portion. I managed three! Being a pudding lover, I was disappointed by the watermelon ice cream. It tasted bland and the texture was powdery. I don't think this will stay on the menu for long. All in all, a positive experience. But I understand why not everyone would be impressed, as I suspect many Londoners aren't willing to (literally) put their money where their mouth is by paying high prices for exotic food they may not enjoy. It seems to me that Shaka Zulu must make its choice: Does it want to fill capacity night after night, or does it want to stay true to its South African roots, which may not be to everyone's tastes? At present, I feel it wants both \u00a0and I don't think that's possible.",

    "text": "This is one of those places where you shouldn't go unless you have a discount. It's right below Gilgamesh in the stables, and is pretty much like an african Gilgamesh, but if you ask the waitstaff if they are connected they will say \"no!\" and then spit in your food. Ok maybe not that drastic, but they will get snippy with you. But apparantly the restaurant locations are owned by the same person, but are separate restaurants with different managers.The food was good. We were on a meal deal so they gave us a lil treat to start that was something kind of like hummous and this amazing pita-tortilla type hybrid that they make in house, and I think that and the dessert were my favorites. I did have a bit of food envy when i watched the table next to me sharing a HUGE platter with steaks and sides... But i am going to pretend that their's cost a lot.Overall, I just felt like they were trying too hard. The waitstaff was over trained, but you could tell that service was not their actual forte. Ex: someone told our waitress \"constantly make sure that their water glasses are filled\" and somehow this translated to mean \"clear their half empty glass of water off the table and then bring them back a new full one\" If i ever do go there again, It would only be with a special, and maybe just for a drink, b/c the decoration is AMAZING. When we emerged from the depths of the restaurant, Raul (Tom) and I forgot that we were in London, and that we weren't actually on an African safari!",

I did enjoy this and was a perfect venue for a Sunday evening birthday celebration.For \u00a325.00 we received a 3 course menu and that was very very good. I started with 3 lamb samosas and from Southall we are spoilt with samosas. These were very very good and the lamb was tasty and Filo pasty. They were accompanied with harissa mayonnaise.As it was a lazy Sunday evening surrounded by great company I opted for the Steak (which is an additional \u00a35.00) it was worth it. The steak was cooked to perfection (medium rare) and the bone marrow red wine jus was releasing all the flavours. The plate was all clean and quietly enjoyed it with crispy french fries.I am a sucker for Trifles and this did not disappoint. After enjoying programmes about how to perfect the trifle I have visited a few places that have disappointed. Shaka Zulu did not. I hated sharing it but the seem to be what everyone else was doing. Did not want to look greedy!This was the best set menu I've had in ages. I would go back again.They take the tastecard. You get 50% off food.Decor was amusing with amazing wood carvings. I was told it was all from Africa. Shaka Zulu is huge and think it will be around for a while.",

An South African theme, if south africa was in Vegas. I know this \u00a35m venture has been heavily researched and planned to give the dinner something authentic... but really?! I've never been, but i'm sceptical. Even if not the genuine article, this place is impressive.This place is masssssive. And just keeps going. I actually got lost going to the loo... nothing to do with all the yummy red wine they gave me!We were lucky enough to meet Barry Vera, the head chef. It was amazing to hear someone of his calibre to speak so passionately about food and learn of his travels around the world. A real treat. We were also lucky enough to try Shaka Zulu sample board of springbok, ostrich, and kudu with different sauces. At \u00a370 for the platter, you got to REALLY want to try some different meats! Im glad I did though! In whole, I would recommend this place for drinks with friends or a works night out (with the boss paying). Novelty place. This was THE best QYPE event I have been on though! So well thought out, interesting, educational. REALLY Excellent job organising, hats off!",

    "text": "Shaka Zulu has the wow factor! This is a destination signature restaurant tucked away in Camden's Stables Market. As you enter, there is an overwhelming assault on the senses that takes an hour or two to settle. The entire, vast subterranean space is covered in carvings and ornamentation, giving a feeling of a pharaoh's tomb or similarly Indiana Jones setting. In fact, some of the designs were lifted from Zulu artefacts at the British Museum and the Louvre. To give some idea of the scale of this place, there is an escalator between the upper and lower floor- 3 huge bars and although we could barely see other diners from where we were sitting there were 250 covers that evening!The lighting gives a warm glow that is immediately soothing and the wonderful mix of lighting, textures, colours and details takes a while to sink in. When added to the fantastic cocktails and South African wines the result is intoxicating! It was explained to me that \u00a35.5 million has been spent on the space and it shows, with no space left undecorated and an incredible attention to detail. The idea is that each time you dine (or just drink and dance on a Saturday night) in this cavernous space you will notice different features and the venue itself will be a talking point. I have to agree, and the standout features for me were the relief wall sculptures of an elephant's head and the megalithic statues representing the leaders of the Bantu peoples. But what is the food like? The inspiration is, of course, South African and the head chef, Barry Vera, explained at great length and with infectious enthusiasm the provenance and inspiration behind the dishes. The best dishes for me were surprisingly the fish dishes. A wonderful Cape Malay inspired pickled Sea Bass (served cold) and an absolutely stunning Rooibos Smoked Salmon with pickled cucumber were not flavours I would associate with South Africa, but the breadth of influences in Rainbow Cuisine started to become apparent as the meal progressed. The 900g Game Board featuring Springbok, Kudu, Ostrich and Boerwors sausage was immense but at \u00a370 it needs to be. Designed as a sharing platter for 2/3 people we were told stories of punters who had ordered one each, and as a starter! For most people with normal appetites, the platter will work as a main course for 2 and the Springbok really stood out for me. All the meats (bar the sausage) were beautifully pink inside and had a rich gamey texture. I have to say that the scale of the place would preclude me from taking a date here, but as a space for a large group to let their hair down, Shaka Zulu is ideal and will leave all present with some fantastic memories, as it has done for me. A stunning space with a feel good vibe.Thank you so much to Barry for his time and passionate explanations of the food and to Roger and Kristiana for inviting me along.",

    "text": "A quick summary would be: go for the food and the aesthetics rather than a watering hole. Perfect for dinner parties of all sizes. It's fairly expensive but you get your money's worth with the tasty food on offer. Looks good, plenty of space though can feel a bit uncomfortably empty at the wrong time of day. I arrived at Shaka Zulu on a Thursday evening and spent a few eager minutes searching for it as there was no name of the restaurant shown anywhere on the outside. I later learned from the waitress that the sign was stolen, however the giant statue of Shaka Zulu above the door should give it away. As soon as I walked in I was in awe of the d\u00e9cor. I wanted to take home the furniture - it was so colourful and interesting. There was clearly a substantial amount of imagination and research that went into the aesthetics of every inch of the restaurant and there's a story behind most artefacts - which the staff are happy to talk to you about. It's also massive. For somewhere so big, though, you'd think there would be a dance floor - especially considering they have an in-house DJ and cocktails at the bar! I was told that the furniture is too heavy to move to make room and that it's not really the dancing kind of place. Still, there's plenty of space between tables to move about if you wanted to. You wouldn't feel out of place dancing in the spaces between tables and it's perfectly suitable for big groups looking to spend the whole evening there or for private diners who are looking for an interesting atmosphere. The food. Oh the food. I was lucky to have the chance to try a lot of different dishes from the menu - and if you're going in a big group I'd recommend ordering different things and simply sharing and tasting a bit of everything, as everything on the menu is a little bit special. Most people rave about the sharing platter (could easy feed and fill 4 people) but my favourite was the Bobotie and Steamed Rice described on the menu as \"..curried mince meat baked with a custard topping with a bled of spices, chutney and herbs\". Sounds boring compared to other options, but it was totally outstanding and I think one of the chef's favourite dishes. The chef himself, Barry Vera, is clearly in love with all his creations and you can tell every dish is important to him. The drinks menu was ok. The house wine was gorgeous, but I was a bit disappointed by the cocktails - a bit expensive for what they are. Mind you, if I order an expensive cocktail I want it served in a bowl surrounded with gimmicks and the cocktails here were just a bit too subtle for my liking. I felt the staff were honest - when they're passionate they show it, when they're busy they show it, when they're happy they show it and when they seriously can't be bothered to deal with you, they show it. They don't pretend to like you and don't pacify you. I think I kind of like it that way though. I can't wait to go back with another crowd of people and see their faces as they sample the food for the first time.",

While the waiters seemed authentically African, none of them spoke clearly or with much enthusiasm. The food was nice but the portions weren't generous- make sure you think about sides, they won't ask. Mussel chowder and ostrich fillet quite tasty.

Have been here three times with friends and definitely need to go again. Its definitely not your local restaurant and slightly on the pricey side, but well worth saving up those pennies for. Great place for date/anniversary night with its ambient lighting, tables are nicely spaced, extensive wine list. Turns into a club on Saturdays. What better place, its huge, its stunning and looks classy. Although after eating all that delicious food in the restaurant I couldn't manage to fit even a martini in, so perhaps you might want to do dinner one night and dancing on another.Its a definite 'must do'!Enjoy your African experience.",

    "text": "I attended a Music Box night at Shaka Zulu where they advertised that Bruno Mars would be hosting. We were treated abominably by Shaka Zulu. The event was supposed to start at 9pm.Everyone was crowded around the escalators at eight-thirty because we were told we weren't allowed downstairs, where the stage was. The servers and customers had a hard time getting through and we were uncomfortably packed together - security did nothing to organise the situation.After that, while we were all packed behind the VIP area from nine o'clock onwards, security personnel and performers on stage kept reassuring us every half an hour that Bruno Mars would be on stage soon. If anyone at Shaka Zulu had made an effort to keep us correctly informed (that Bruno Mars would not arrive until after twelve a.m., that he would not be going on stage and was simply going to have his own table inside the VIP area) then we would have left early enough not to have to be standing there for three hours straight, unable to move from our spots, get a drink or a bite to eat, dance, or go home at a decent time. However, the case was that we stood there from 9pm to 12.30 am. Bruno Mars arrived at 12 and headed straight for his table and only sat there drinking as the crowd of 100+ people looked on. There was no live performance from him as they stated on their Facebook page (\"Shaka Zulu: This is his last and ONLY performance in the UK before flying back to the US on Wednesday evening!\")The way that Shaka Zulu dealt with the negative feedback the day after this was horrendous as well. After deleting evidence of their having stated Bruno Mars would be singing and performance and only reinstating the original posts after criticism about their ignoring the situation, they sent out a mass email to dissatisfied customers (and there were a LOT, just look at their Facebook page to see the complaints!) offering a voucher as a 'gesture of goodwill', as well as repeatedly emphasising that Bruno Mars was only 'hosting', and that he did 'host' at his table. I replied and said that they stated he would be singing on their Facebook page, and that I would like a refund of my tickets, as I would not have attended if they hadn't falsely advertised that Bruno Mars would be performing on stage. All I got as a reply was that my comment would be passed on and no acknowledgement of my complaints.False advertising and misrepresentation, as well as unprofessional customer service and way of handling a situation that resulted from their irresponsible advertising and actions. All they are after is a quick way to make money, with no regards for integrity or customer satisfaction.",

    "text": "Having only opened a year and a half ago, Shaka Zulu is creating all kinds of impressive names for itself after winning Best Interior Design Award at the London Bar and Club Awards 2012, and being named Prestige Events Coolest Events Venue in 2011. But this simply wasn't enough for those at Shaka Zulu, and they've decided to go one step further with a new offering uncannily entitled The Meat Bar, serving, among other delights, some very taste bud tickling Meat Cocktails!London's meatiest tipples look set to become the newest and hottest trend of the year. The first of the bizarrely amazing concoctions is a modern twist on a classic - The Bloody Bacon, which is made from a 24 hour mature Bloody Mary mix (a Shaka Zulu speciality) and bacon vodka, garnished with celery, crispy smoked bacon and a skewer of soft cheese and cherry tomatoes.Another totally unique cocktail featured is the Meatequita, a blend of tequila reposado infused with chorizo, vegetable juice, balsamic vinegar, smoked sea salt pepper and port, which is then served either straight up or, for the real meat lovers, with beef biltong strips and chorizo. Fish lovers in attendance can sample the Wheeling Salmon, made with smoked salmon-infused vodka with lemon pepper and ice, and served with a host of traditional martini accompaniments including smoked salmon, stuffed baby red peppers and olives. Each of these delicious drinks has been lovingly crafted by Bar Manager extraordinaire, Tony Safqi.The interior of this unique nightspot transports you straight to the heart of South Africa, with its 20ft Zulu Warriors and carved wooden murals that cover every inch of Shaka Zulu's walls and ceilings. If you mix this with the enthralling taste of meat cocktails, you quickly enter a surreal world of flavours, senses and sights.Who said meat was just for eating?",

Maybe my notorious good fortune on culinary expeditions has struck again, but I actually very much enjoyed my two experiences of Shaka Zulu.Yes, its themed and gimmicky but done so in a rather stylish way. If you like your restaurants and food understated however, Shaka Zulu is definately not for you :-) Call me shallow but I was rather impressed when the waiter told me they spent 5 million pounds just on the interior decoration. The prices are a little hefty, but with a special deal (I had the groupon deal) it was definately worth it. Maybe I m a little biased because I m always deliriously happy to see some exotic meat on the menu?I had a try of the venison tartar and the ostrich carpaccio, which were lovely, followed by a taste of the springbok filet (lovely) and the zebra which my friend ordered which however was a little like any odd schnitzel and thus a little disappointing.We finished the evening with a roibush creme brulee which was unexpectedly cold but delicious and the dessert milkshake (which is a novel idea but somehow a little weird). Staff was attentive and the restaurant was rather empty. On my return visit I just tried the ostrich burger from the bar menu which was nice enough, whilst my friend ordered the fish bar platter (for 15\u00a3 which seemed rather reasonably priced) which however was nothing special.So if you are looking for a cool location with a bit of an exotic feel and like to try some food thats a little bit different, then Shaka Zulu might be right up your street.",

    "text": "This restaurant came highly recommended by South African and they passed on a Groupon offer on the set menu.Tucked away in the bustling stables market in Camden there is a small entrance where an escalator takes you down to an extravagant African themed restaurant that covers 2 floors. The staff are all eager to tell you the interior is all imported from Africa and predominantly hand carved etc, it was really surreal being surrounded by so much detail.When we ordered our food the waitress kindly explained some of the dishes and she seemed polite enough. We asked for a jug of tap water about 3 times during the meal and finally the 4th time we were lucky. The food was tasty, our starter of soft shell crabs was delicious but served on the smallest dishes imaginable for what reason I have no idea. For mains I had steak and chips and by boyfriend had the Bobotie which from the description scared me (mince meat with custard topping), but when I tried it I had food envy! Dessert was ok, I had a doughnut thing which I was really excited about but it was stodgy and I wasn't keen on the lime drizzle on it.Overall it wasn't bad considering the saving we made with the Groupon. However I felt a bit rushed through our food, as soon as my boyfriend finished his plate was taken away regardless of the fact I was still eating which I think is rude and makes you feel like they want you to hurry up and leave. Then when we had finally finished everything we waited for ages to get someone's attention to settle the bill because usually with a Groupon you still have to pay for service charge. Once we did speak to someone they said we could just leave. You'd think leaving a restaurant would be easy, here it's not! Leave where you came in? No. We did however find the gents loo for my boyfriend. While I was waiting for him looking for the exit sign, a manager came up to me to tell me I needed to pay the service charge. Good job we could find our way out.Not sure I'd pick to come here again, but I won't mind if someone suggested it.",

And the location in Camden is too busy, and too dirty, with southeast Asian street food vendors shoving food in you face in the most aggressive, pressure selling manner possible.",

The \"7-hour\" lamb was a huge disappointment. \u00a0I have never seen any meat that was cooked on a rotisserie for 7 hours that did not just fall off the bone. \u00a0We had to saw the meat.The only bright spot was our bottle of wine, and one very nice young bus boy, who may have been the only thing in the restaurant that was authentically south african.All that was missing was the annoying hum of the vuvuzela.",

Found the overbearing statues of Zulu warriors all over the place a bit creepy rather than fun. We had a lovely time due to the crowd I was with in party mode so we made the most of it, it's pretty over-priced for what it is but I guess they have to make their money back after spending all that cash to build the venue just a few years ago. We won't return in a hurry as we didn't find the staff too friendly or welcoming, the reception staff make you wait ages to be shown to your table and then act as if they're in some high profile executive job and treat you just as a number at a table rather than as individuals. Toilets are bizarre in that they seem to be communal which is a bit freaky if you're applying your lipstick and a chap walks in and just starts doing his business behind you in a cubicle without closing the door! Good points: good music, decent foodBad points: snotty staff, communal toilets, over-priced",

    "text": "This place represents the worst in prefabricated pseudo-African tat. Amme is spot on with her comparison to a Epcot Center restaurant. \u00a0My BF and I thought it felt like something out of Las Vegas. \u00a0Either description meant that we were too old and not young enough to enjoy this ambiance and it was clearly out of place in Camden.The restaurant is way too large for the number of diners booked, making it feel especially cavernous. \u00a0Despite there being less than 50 people in peak dinner hour, it took ages to be seated and wrong dishes were brought to the table at least twice. \u00a0The food itself was horrible and unbelievably overpriced. \u00a0The staff manipulated us into getting an extremely expensive \"Taste of Africa\" menu that was advertised as having four courses but only really seemed like three, as the restaurant had the nerve to count the dried beef jerky snack known as biltong as an actual course. Pathetic.Similar to Amme, I was also disappointed in the overdone \u00a07-hour lamb as \u00a0main course. It was so chewy I actually couldn't tell what type of meat it was. I finally worked out that the 7 hours referred to the amount of time the meat had been left out to dry on the warming plate, not the length of time it had been cooked. \u00a0My BF was also aghast that the small portion of lamb was served without a side - another shameless way this restaurant baits its dinners into adding to the already overpriced meal. \u00a0I was told during my unusually long wait for our table that the restaurant has been open for only a month. \u00a0I would be surprised if this tourist trap in a non-touristy area is open for more than a year.",

    "text": "This is slice of Las Vegas in Camden market. Yes, they are trying to be authentic but the over-the-top decor and scale of everything does add to a certain unique experience that isn't possible to create elsewhere. If it was more tasteful and toned down it just would be a themed restaurant. However, this place is big and bold. I first went on my birthday after being won over by 'sleb-dropping with the obligatory Amy Winehouse visit PR and such awful reviews that warranted me to prove them wrong and check it out. I also wanted to see why they spend a zillion pounds (approx) in creating this place. As an adventurous eater (or a 'Gastronaut' as I like to call myself) the birthday meal and the Press night I went to both involved some Southern African delicacies of various random fish/meat/veg. It's eccentric and interesting and almost validates the super high prices. The drinks menu is also over-priced but I guess they need to recoup some of $$$'s spent on the most impressive Vegas-style restaurant, since the also awesome-but-expensive pan-Asian Gilgamesh opened next door. Both gimmicky restaurants, but fabulous gimmicks. It's great for a different experience when Pizza Express just doesn't do it. Psst speaking of Italian and OTT restaurants, I've heard rumours that a final underground super-space in the redeveloped Stables Market complex will house a Venetian themed mega restaurant. I can only hope in involves a themed Italo-operatic-art-affair where you'll be greeted the San Marco marble lion, Venetian mask wearing staff and a Gondolier will float you to your table. If this doesn't happen then I'll return back to see warrior Shaku Zulu and enjoy some more biltong and braai, this time for Africa.",

It was the first time that I had tried South African cuisine and I was not disappointed. The tasting menu was a journey through the different flavours that define SA cuisine \u00a0not that I know much about SA food but there were several SA Qypers who attended the event and confirmed that the dishes were indeed genuine SA grub. We were treated to several starters and then a grand finale of Braai meat board featuring ostrich, springbok, kudu and boerewors, my personal favourite being the kudu. Althogether a great evening and I enjoyed the different flavours and types of meat I was introduced to. Sadly, I had to leave early so I missed dessert and, judging from what I heard the next day, a quite spectacular round of cocktails. I would be happy to go back to Shaka Zulu; the interior is stunning, they have a large bar area and the food is well suited for either those who would like to try South African cuisine or expats who are pining for a bit of springbok.",

    "text": "Going down under the market I was unsure what to expect from Shaka Zulu. I was pleasantly surprised at how warm the restaurant felt for such a large space, and more surprised to learn there was a second floor down. The upstairs seems to have a feel of a more casual meet up area and the downstairs with the large circular tables a great space for dinner with many friends. It found it very reminiscent of the carving extravagance found upstairs at Gilgamesh but with an African theme, though the 2 restaurants are not owned by the same people. I was unsure what to expect from food that was South African as I have never been. I found to my surprise it can be spicy, which makes me happy, and is very flavourful. It seems the restaurant has taken in all of the influences that make up cuisine in South Africa, which means the menu contains some unexpected options such as pickled fish. As others have said vegetarians my not appreciate the menu but as a meat eater there will defiantly be lots to consider. No matter which meat you order you can expect it to arrive perfectly cooked, this is something the Shaka Zulu excels at. I couldn't decide which was better the ostrich or the spiringbok, both tender and full of flavour with not a bit of toughness to them, add a side of the tasty peri peri fries - Fantastic! Staff were very welcoming and service was friendly. I look forward to visiting again and trying some more new dishes!",

    "text": "I had wanted to go to this place since it opened in Summer last year and I was lucky to be one of the few qypers that was invited to the event that Qype organised here, where we sampled a varied range of dishes that this restaurant offers. Thanks, Qype! As the food was being served, the Head Chef was explaining to us each dish, what a treat! It was my first experience eating South African food and it couldn't have been better. I was seated next to a South African girl, who assured us that the food was very authentic indeed, so we knew we were having the real thing. The head chef, Barry Vera, is an accomplished chef that has been Head Chef in Michelin starred restaurants and is from South Africa, so you couldn't get anyone better for this place. We also got to meet Roger Payne, the owner of this establishment, who explained the detail and effort that had been put into this place to make it astonishing (job well done) and authentic, bringing most of the materials and all the sculptures directly from Africa itself. This has come at a cost though, having invested over \u00a35m in this venture. But it does show! This place will become an iconic restaurant in London, word of mouth is already spreading rapidly. If anything is against it, it could be the location. It is right next to the Stables Market in Camden Market. It is the type of place where you go for dinner, so you wouldn't go to the market and then for dinner as this would be too early (the market closes at around 5.30 or so) and this place is a bit of a way off for those that work in the City or the West End and so on. It is the type of place where you plan to go in advance, and therefore it will most likely be busy on Fri and Sat evenings but struggle during the week. It also is enormous (and I mean enormous), so even when it is busy it does not feel like it that much. And when you go in the middle of the week it really does feel empty. It is not something that bothers me, but the lack of atmosphere may put some people off. For me the d\u00e9cor alone creates enough atmosphere! I have been several times since the Qype event, showing the place to other Londoners or people that were visiting London for a few days, and everyone absolutely loved it. I have gone through most of the menu now having gone so many times, and I have enjoyed pretty much everything, particularly the carpaccio of ostrich and the braised lamb shank samosa (some may find the taste of the latter one a bit too strong) as starters, and the bobotie and steamed rice and goat's cheese tarte fine as main courses. The bobotie is minced beef and spiced custard top, with pilau rice and chutney, absolutely delicious. I would also recommend to try the Shaka Zulu sample board, which is 900gr of meat from springbok, ostrich, kudu and boerewors with different sauces. I found the taste of some of these meats too strong and I wouldn't order it again, but it is something different to try and definitely a must. Plus all other people I have eaten it with loved it, so it may just be me. At \u00a370 the platter, some may find it pricey but it serves 2/3 people as a main course, and as I said, as a one-off it would be ok. If you want to try different things, I would suggest to go with a few people and all of you to share everyone's plates. I have done this and everyone prefers it as it is the type of place that you may not go regularly and want to have a good taste of what South African food is like, so it is a good option. As an example, the last time I visited it was last week and it was 4 of us. We all ordered the Taste of Africa menu, in which there are 3 or 4 options to choose per course, so we simply ordered everything and we all got to sample every dish on the Taste of Africa menu, which was all delicious by the way, and it has some of my favourites from the main menu. At \u00a335/head for the Taste of Africa menu, this also includes a caipirinha, which is great value, as the cocktail itself costs you \u00a39. By the way, not much has been mentioned about the desserts, but they are great too! Some people find this place a bit pricey, although I think it is worth the price for the kind of restaurant that you are in. However, it is fantastic value if you use the Tastelondon card, with 50% off your food bill, well worth it! I have not mentioned much about the d\u00e9cor, but it has been described already on other reviews. Plus I found it so astonishing that I would have to write a separate review just for the d\u00e9cor itself. You could say it is excessive, and it is. But it is an experience, every detail is thought of, and I find something new every time I go. My favourites are the bronze elephant sculptures on top of the open kitchen downstairs and the gigantic African tribe sculptures on one of the corners downstairs. But don't be shy, walk around, explore and I am sure you will find it quite special too. The only reason why I am not giving this place 5 stars is because the service",

    "text": "Well, many people have heard of the newest and largest African restaurant in London. Opened amid much fanfare the venue holds up to 850 diners and cost \u00a35.5 million to create.The first time I went here there were a few teething problems, mainly the card readers didn't work and staff seemed a little out of their depth. On revisiting last week I was pleased to note that there was a huge improvement!The decor is the first thing you notice on descending the escalators into the basement venue. Tiny shells cover the walls and wooden statues stand sentry over many areas. The legend of Shaka Zulu is one of a great Zulu chief and lends gravitas to the quirky decor and theme.The upper level comprises two bars and casual seating areas for drinks at the Oyster bar or bar food. Downstairs the full menu is served in the Braai Restaurant, with an open kitchen window letting you see the buzz of chefs in action.My friend and I had already tried some mixed Biltong pieces upstairs before deciding to stay for dinner. Blitong always put me off, but this was ok, if not a taste sensation. Once ensconsed at a table for two on thrones to make a chieftain jealous, we perused the extensive menu.We both chose the 7 hour spit roast lamb with cumin salt on a bed of chakalaka and amasi (grated vegetables ) with a type of tasty jus (\u00a316.50). This was great, the lamb was flavoursome and loved the gravy. We added a side of Msamba for \u00a34.75 ( spinach, tomato, onion and peanut salad)and peri peri fries for \u00a32.95 - delicious! For dessert I ordered a type of twisted doughnut with two dishes of syrup and sugar but I found it a little stogier than I would have liked.A windhoek beer was light and different to go with dinner. Next time I'd like to try a tasting dish with ostrich and springbok. The menu is a bit pricey, so it's best for a romantic date or for a special occasion. Best bits: the patchwork colourful chairs in the upstairs bar, the coloured lights on warrior statues and vast array of bottles around the lower floor bar.Worst bits: not good for tight budgets, takes a lot of people to get really crowded, not all food to my liking.Basically, it's adventurous, brash and totally different, you will either love it or hate it, but make sure you try it!",

I knew at once that this would be a dinner to remember. The starters were fantastic across the board. The first dish, biltong, was the best I have ever tasted and came with a delicious dipping sauce made from a blend of red peppers and pecan nuts. I was lucky enough to sample a variety of appetisers, and one that really stood out was the ostrich carpaccio, with a unique flavour and a velvety texture. The rooibos smoked salmon had a much more delicate flavour, but was just as memorable and certainly high on my list of dishes to order on the next visit! The main courses on offer are equally delicious, and before facing the notorious 'meat platter', I sampled the bobotie. This Malaysian-inspired dish is extremely popular is South Africa, and it's difficult to find in London, but Shaka Zulu got it spot on, with delicately flavoured meat and a creamy topping. The real highlight was, of course, the meat platter, a mammoth combination of springbok, ostrich, kudu and borewors sausage. My initial ambitions of tackling it alone were soon thwarted, and it took at least four of us to get through it all!",

I was literally blown away upon entering the building as the decor is just spectacular - large Zulu statues and the walls decorated with cowrie shells. To start we were given some sparkling South African wine, it's the very same wine that Barack Obama chose to drink on his inauguration so you just know that's it's got to be good. However, if the wine was good then the biltong was something else entirely - it was beautifully spiced with chilli seeds and served alongside a dip that tasted a little like red pepper houmous, but which we were told contained a delicious blend of pecan nuts. I had several delicious dishes at the restaurant - salmon smoked with rooibos, had a incredible flavour and this coming from someone that doesn't even like redbush tea! I admit to feeling slightly dubious about the Cape Malay pickled fish, the name might be a little offputting, but it's definitely one to try and the sauce that it was served with was divine. The ostrich carpaccio was perhaps the most unique dish of the evening, and while raw ostrich might not be everyone's cup of tea, I strongly advise you to try it for yourself! I've had bobotie before, but I really liked the light curry flavour that the chefs in Shaka Zulu managed to create. When I've had it before it's always been quite spicy and tangy, but this was real comfort food and the perfect dish to have on a cold winter's evening. Next, we braved a meat platter. These bad boys are meant for three people but we heard tales of how people had come into Shaka Zulu and ordered just the one for themselves. The two men on our table thought that they could rise to the challenge, but after we'd shared the delicious kudu, springbok, ostrich and borewors sausage out amongst the four of us they only thing that they were left eating were their words!",

    "text": "Shaka Zulu is a huge restaurant and lounge described as a \"theatre of food and drink that brings a taste of Africa to the heart of London\". It is named after the second most recognised person from southern Africa (after Nelson Mandela) - Shaka kaSenzangakhona, or Shaka Zulu, the most influential leader of the Zulu Kingdom. With any establishment of this size that can hold 850 people, there are many things going on at once and customers will experience it to some extent based on their own background. Those who are already aware of the Shaka Zulu backstory will probably be knowledgeable enough to appreciate the quality of meats and spices used in the recipies that make it a \"taste of home\". The Shaka Zulu theme may however seem a little forced, despite the efforts to bring some authenticity to the props used to decorate the venue. For the rest of us I can only say it was a great experience to be introduced with other Qypers to this type of cuisine by owner Roger Payne and the other members of his team. The meats were excellent and the Cape Malay pickled fish stood out for me as the most unexpectedly delicious dish. However, without a good understanding of southern African culture and cuisine the excellent quality of the food could be lost to some diners without a little guidance and explanation. This leaves the venue itself which is certainly a memorable experience given all the beautifully intricate work that has been done to bring the Shaka Zulu theme to life. It is however a themed experience and is very different form experiencing a \"taste of home\". On the Thursday night we visited the service was excellent. The place itself felt a little quiet given its immense size, but I'd expect it to be an amazing experience when full on a Friday or Saturday night, or even when the venue is used for corporate functions.",

Upon entering (past the drumming chap standing in the doorway - what the hell was the interview process for that gig?) we were treated to an odd little dance of being seated in a waiting area before immediately being sent to the cloakroom, and then following what you could only describe as a table guide down the escalator and to our table. Any bewilderment at the complicated procedure though gets forced from your brain amid the rich visual tapestry in front of you - carved wood panelling on the walls, interspersed with tapestries, bronze scupltures of warriors and animals, and various other stuff to make you go \"wow\". We'd booked in with the Taste of Africa menu: a 4-course affair which served well to circumvent any indecision, whilst providing a nice wide-spectrum of the restaurant's capabilites. Whilst nibbling on the supremely tasty Shraak bread & goreme, and quite a decent shaved biltong with Masai Mara style sauce, we pondered the authenticity of the place, and came quickly to the conclusion that it wasn't striving for any sense of authenticity but rather going for the mediated experience. And with the Ladysmith Black Mambazo soundtrack, the phrase \"Lion King Disneyland\" seemed to apply quite nicely. As the waitress brought out the Cape Malay pickled fish, we half expected her to be followed by a line of tapdancing warthogs singing Hakuna Matata, however the sarcasm soon gave way to lots of \"Mmmm\"ing - far more than anything with the words \"pickle\" and \"fish\" in the title have ever elicited from my lips. Fingers. Whatever. We accompanied our very tasty 7 Hour Spitroast Dorper Lamb with a Very nice bottle of South African Bordeaux blend: the temptation was there to go with one of the many Graham Beck wines or the fairly stiffly priced but yummy Kanonkop Pinotage, but it turned out perfectly as it was. We'd ordered some Piri Piri Fries to go with the lamb in a small gesture of semi-smug ridiculance, but as it turned out it was a good idea. And they were bloody tasty. The music by now had inexplicably journeyed through clichee country, via some South African RnB nonsense, and come back to Ladysmith Black Mambazo again. Finishing off, I had difficulty picking the subtle flavour change of the Rooibos Brulee, but that was possibly because I'd been drawn into the dessert cocktail option of the Rum Blazer: a visually impressive taste explosion, which featured blazing cinnamon and rum-infused berries. I know this place only opened in August, and I briefly wondered how many Rum Blazers had been served in the downstairs part of the restaurant as I saw the barman's assistant nervously eyeing the flames from the cocktail licking towards the ceiling. It seems unfair to downgrade the place for its \"facadeyness\", when it makes no pretensions about being other than what it is. And it was very nice indeed. But I can't give it full marks because it didn't install itself in my brain as an \"oh my god, I've GOT to come back here\" place. And, I guess, just that Disneyland feel made it a bit discomforting (as if to ram that particular point home, a group of girls sitting near us had elected to walk around and have their photos taken with all of the statues, which prompted me to wonder what time the choreographed wildebeeste stampede might mercifully take place). One final thing: Shaka Zulu is similar to Gilgamesh in many ways, and many of those ways are excellent, but inevitably one of those is that they're similarly pricey. Definitely one to do your research on, rather than rocking up for a casual meal.",

My mum has been here before and we went back for a b-day treat, three floors of intricate south african design carvings, escalators and large bars, the loo's are something else?! Lol It's def a once a year visit for us being that the prices are pretty high but your paying for a whole experience, we have a shared sea food starter which arrived as two tiered platter of oysters and massive clams mixed with prawns, cockles, sauces, winkles (how cute even though not my fave) and swirls of liquid nitrogen and stacks of ice to keep it all cool and fresh and looking pretty impressive.We tried the capaccio which is a type of south african deer? Really good! Highlights were trying my husband's Zebra! I think it tasted somewhere between pork and steak and you actually probably wouldn't know really but it's all about novelty here, the south african dancing and singing throughout the restauraunt, the Shark Ally cocktails and most of all this fab after dinner drink which name slips me but blew your socks off and comes with a waiter who explains it and turns it into an event, Later it turns into a club and fills up with the young and beautiful looking fab and we admired from a far and took our pretty tipsy arse's home!",

    "text": "Shaka Zulu tries to be a restaurant and club and as a result, both elements suffer.I had an office party here and I think we went for a fairly budget set menu so perhaps the a-la-carte menu offers better quality. Nonetheless, food wise everything was average. I had a three course meal and opted for smoked salmon to start, lamb for the main and a chocolate tart for dessert.The smoked salmon tasted like it was just from a supermarket. the lamb was very decent but unspectacular, likewise for the dark chocolate tart.Towards the end of the meal (2230ish maybe?) they cranked the music up and it essentially turned into a club. It was completely the wrong crowd level for the volume of music though (and continued to be throughout the night). Music was, like the food, decent - generally popular electronic songs from the last 10-15 years with the odd bit of rap/pop thrown in and a weird christmas mash-up for the last 30 minutes.All that being said, I had a really fun night. The decor is gaudy and ott but definitely interesting and certainly a talking point. Our night started with a drinks reception at the upstairs bar which had a chill vibe.I wouldn't ever be brave enough to suggest this as an option for fear of others not enjoying it but if you find yourself here, you'll probably have a good time.",

    "text": "I feel really bad when people come back from a restaurant I've been to where I personally had a great dining experience and they had a really bad one. It seems Shaka Zulu is one of those places. Reading through previous reviews most of them are either really good or really bad and it is a combination of food and service. It seems to be a place that lacks consistency depending on what day you go and what you order. However this was my second dining experience using a Gourmet Society card and I can honestly say on both visits I had an amazing experience with lovely, attentive service and delicious food. We went there on a Wednesday night and found it to be pretty empty. It didn't bother us at all as we enjoyed the company of the statues and was too 'wowed' by the African carving on the walls of African warriors and animals, beautifully crafted tables and the rest of the luxurious decor. It was a two storey restaurant connected by indoor escalators and big enough to hold two groups of Kizomba dance lessons downstairs which we enjoyed watching as we ate. Although there did seem a shortage of staff, the one waiter guy we kept seeing was awesomely fast paced at getting round to everyone and making sure our needs were met. Couldn't fault on his service either as he was approachable and friendly.We started our meal with Crocodile cigars and Ham Hock and Wildebeest. Our intention on visiting was to try out exotic meats and although that is what we ordered, the starters did not allow us to explore it's original flavour and texture. They were great as they were though. For example the Crocodile cigars came as spring rolls, light pastry and lightly spiced and if they were just originally spring rolls I would have been very pleased. But knowing we're paying double to taste crocodile meat it did fail us as there wasn't enough in there to taste what crocodile is or get the texture. The curry spices also hid it's original flavours. Wish they could find another way of serving the meat. Ham Hock and Wildebeest was more successful as it was more meaty, coarse and generously portioned. The meat was juicy, lean and well seasoned \u00a0But I still had trouble distinguishing what was pork and what was wildebeest. But if I was judging on the flavour of these starters rather than my intentions they were very decent and tasty and it is only fair to review them that way. For mains we shared a zebra fillet and springbok loin both cooked medium rare as requested. All the steaks were served with shoestring fries and a little side of salad although they were more for decor and texture rather to fill you up as the portion was teeny. As lovely and crunchy the fries were it was just the crisp end. But it was all about the main event and I can honestly say it was one of the best steaks I've had. The zebra was incredibly tender and soft, more spongy in texture compared to beef and sweeter tasting. For a fillet it wasn't very gamey but more delicate in flavour and sweet. Springbok was more firmer probably because it was the loin but I preferred the texture. It was still incredibly tender, effortless to cut with the knife and had a richer deeper meaty taste compared to the zebra. Both were very succulent and cooked perfectly pink inside. I highly recommend both.For those with a big appetite like us it definitely wasn't filling and so for sides we ordered celeriac mash and roast cinnamon butternut. Both were amazing with the butternut beautifully grilled till soft so some of the sugar caramalised. The celeriac mash was also seasoned nicely and creamed till smooth. It had more taste than the usual potato and I much preferred it. For dessert we decided to take the full advantage of trying African cuisine so we ordered the trio of South African dessert. It consisted of a African milk tart but the filling with not as creamy and milky as I would have liked it. It was quite actually dense and rubbery. More successful was the koeksisters which resembled very much like a Turkish doughnut with it being coated in syrup, spongy, sticky and sweet. The last dessert was more a African cocktail made from icecream mixed in Kahlua to give that coconut essence. The alchohol could have been stronger but that's my personal preference. I do love coconut and ice cream so enjoyed it nevertheless. Altogether the dessert platter was average but it was nice to get a taste of what African dessert is.I would highly recommend Shaka Zulu as a place everyone must visit at least one. Of course I do hope everyone experiences the same level of quality of food and service as we did that evening but just for the amazing eye catching decor it has to be visited. I would advise everyone to stick to the steaks as they did not disappoint. There is usually a 50% offer on Toptable across mains made available to everyone because without it the damage can be quite bad. But this is no ordinary restaurant and definitely one I put on the 'romantic' and 'birthday' venue list.",

    "text": "In an ongoing battle to compete with the central London big boys the warrior king Shaka has invaded North London with his warriors in true African style.I came with some friends for my birthday and it is obvious as soon as you enter that no expense was spared, with elaborate d\u00e9cor, carvings and 20ft zulu warrior statues.We had reserved a table and were all very impressed with the look and feel of the restaurant as you are immersed into the surroundings. It immerses you in the same was as The Rainforest Caf\u00e9 but with a more raw and adult feel. The venue is set over two floors with the main restaurant area on the lower level.We started off with some Biltong selection, which included salty and spicy dried meat such as smoked buffalo droewors, sliced beef biltong and chilli bite sticks. They were very different to most things i've tried before. Imagine pepperami's with a bit more of a kick!For main course, in order to sample a wider variety of the menu, we all decided to share the King Shaka Game Board. A selection of springbok, chilli boerwors, boerwors, Waterbuck and Zebra with piri piri potato wedges, chakalaka and sheba sauce. The aromas and flavours of the meat were each unique with everyone enjoying what was on offer and having a preference for future visits. My favourite was Zebra so if I come again I'll probably try a Zebra fillet.To wash down the safari we all went with the Cape Town Share, Santa Teresa Claro, Bacardi oakeheart rum, watermelon liqueur, coconut syrup, pineapple and fresh lime juice. All this with a flaming passion fruit skin. Imagine an exotically made fish bowl drink, served in a giant Elephant jug and you've got the right idea!After dinner we headed to the bar area for champagne and dancing. Make sure you've paid your rent as just one round of regular cocktails will set you back over \u00a340.If you love people watching this place is great as both floors are accessed by escalators with bars and dancing areas on both floors. Whoever designed this place seemed to think alcohol and escalators would be an ingenious mix, and it was! Watching people get off the escalators is entertainment in itself with everyone enjoying the show!Overall, I was very impressed with Shaka Zulu, our bank balances weren't, but this is yet another excellent venue making Camden one of the best places to go for a night out with sacrificing your high standards when you don't fancy travelling into Central London.",

I think we lucked out with our waitress who had only recently started working at Shaka Zulu. She's from a small bay town in South Africa and runs a restaurant there with her parents.

It blended nicely with the peppercorn sauce, along with a side dish of Morogo (kind of spinach), and peri-peri fries.I have to say, the only let-down is the service. Even though they were all very nice and professional, the fact that we had four waiters probably made our dinner unnecessarily lengthy, and the communication between them was not really great.Anyway, I'll be back there, it's simply a unique atmosphere !",

If it were named \"Space Rocket Cosmos Diner\" you'd expect an overindulgent spaceship theme. It's the same thing. Much more important: the food. We ordered the soft shell crab appetizer, which was fairly large and quite tasty, and one of the massive King of Something Or Other platters: two kinds of sausage, and zebra, waterbuck, and springbok steaks. The meat was all really good -- and not gamey in the way you might expect. The flavors were distinct, but surprisingly mild. The zebra was probably a bit overdone (not that I would know - I'm not a lion; I don't eat zebra on a daily basis), but I could eat springbok all day the way they cooked it. It's expensive, no doubt. But not more so than one should expect, given the menu. And we carnivored it down with a really interesting rhubarb martini and a nice merlot. We went on a Wednesday night: the place was almost empty. But this is a feature, not \u00a0a bug. We were 20 minutes late for our reservation, and they couldn't care less. There were plenty of people in our small section of the restaurant, and it was quiet enough to talk comfortably. This restaurant would make a good spot for a fancy, mid-week date.",

They were surprisingly mild and tender. I'm not sure I'd wait in a long line to get in, but it's a great date spot. There's tons to talk about, good food and reasonable prices -- especially given how expensive the weird meat must be. Plus, you can say you ate zebra.",

    "text": "I was part of a group of 10 Qypers who were invited for a evening meal at Shaka Zulu, and the restaurant lived up to my expectations in terms of the splendid decor inside! It seems like no expense was spared to make it a destination, with intricate carvings decorating almost every wall and even a row of floor-to-ceiling warrior statues. Inside, the restaurant is split over two massive floors, with bar and restaurant areas on both. We were treated to an assortment of starters and mains. Particularly recommended is the Cape Malay pickled fish, which was a mouthwatering mixture of fresh sea bass with lots of spices for flavour and tantalising sweet-sour combination that was a great starter. From the mains, do try the meat sample board, if you can afford it! At \u00a370, its not cheap, but you do get 900g of meat (enough for 2-3 people), with a selection of springbok, kudu, and ostrich meat as well as boerewor sausage. Shaka Zulu is not just about food however - we tried a sampling of cocktails from one of their mixologists - and the unique concoctions were refreshingly good. However, we decided to fool around and playfully mixed two of the cocktails into one - and found that we had created a punchy new number! Shaka Zulu is a great destination if you're looking for an exciting night out of great food, drinks, and an amazing theme dining experience.

    "text": "If you want to impress someone then Shaka Zulu will do just that. The decor is stunning and after a talk by the owner we found out the tiles were moulded from statues in the British museum and some from the Louvre in Paris too! Every detail has been considered, from the handmade fabric on the seating to the tied together straw that you so often see in Africa. They even have a wall made entirely of shells! Can you tell I've been to a lot of galleries and this was one that served food too, an added bonus all round! The food left you wanting more and we were give quite a range. I'd recommend the salmon and biltong for starters and they even have an African version of our Shepherds pie and instead of potato there's a cream mixture, which they cover with mango chutney. Yum! If you're more of a meat lover then they have a really large selection of 'tropical' meats, Ostrich, Kudu and Springbok. I feel pretty bad having seen these animals for the first time on a plate rather than in the wild, but I hate to say it, they were very tasty. The Shaka Zulu invents all it's own cocktails too and make sure you get them to bring you the flaming brandy with berries, it's delicious! I felt the service was good, but on a quiet night they seem to just focus on certain tables, so be careful. There's a cloakroom there, which is useful and a party night on Saturdays. It's a mini Gilgamesh, but I loved it there and this was a great experience all round too. Would definitely go again.",

The service here was almost non-existent, and gets progressively worse as the evening goes on, such that by the end of the meal your waitress may have forgotten to clear your plates, your dessert may take another 1hr to present itself and you need a near miracle to get your bill.\u00a0The food itself was permissible but forgettable and in somewhat smaller portions; you can tell that effort is put into presentation but it tastes average. The cocktails look nice on paper but are at least a third filled with chunks of ice. In essence, Shaka Zulu is somewhere unique to go to for a drink whilst admiring the fake yet impressive African-inspired interior decoration but it you want a meal, prepare to be left alone to your own devices and have your patience well and truly tested.",

    "text": "When I first moved to London I had an extensive list of big name restaurants I wanted to try but like most Londoners, I discovered and came to rely on smaller, more local options. So years later, I'd still not been to Shaka Zulu and my constantly dwindling finances meant that wasn't likely to change. However, my friend Tasha has a Taste Card so we decided to go this past Thursday. Tasha is late for everything so although I was running behind schedule, I didn't think it would matter. Tasha was already there and seated by the bar however, with two Cape Towner cocktails ready. Earlier in the day, I'd been on the Shaka Zulu website and there was a voucher for a 2-4-1 cocktail deal before 8pm so we both signed up - there's four cocktails to choose from and at \u00a311 each, it's a good deal! Don't forget to show your confirmation email at reception as they have to print you a ticket to exchange at the bar. We had two lots of the Cape Towners (gin based) and they were delicious.Our table was for 7pm and at 7:30, we were still waiting with our buzzer. My friend went to quiz the hostess and discovered that we'd basically been forgotten about. However, we were showed to a table shortly after. The restaurant itself is absolutely huge so can handle a big capacity, although it was relatively quiet on this occasion. When we had arrived there was a bit of a din as there was an event - the pre Christmas party showcase (complete with Christmas tree in June!) which was odd!The Taste Card will get you 50% off mains and starters (not any of the large sharing platters) so we decided to push the boat out. I knew exactly what I was going to order, having decided a week before hand. I wanted crocodile and I wanted zebra and nothing would stand in my way.For starters, we both opted for the harissa crocodile (I'd been put off the croc cigars from having read Yelp reviews of them not being very crocodiley). This dish was served cold with a iceberg lettuce garnish. I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to being served iceberg at restaurants and dinner parties but the croc was so flipping lovely that I didn't care! It was my first ever crocodile meal and it tasted just like I thought - sort of... Fresh watery? Hard to describe but truthfully very, very nice!Next came the main - my zebra! I love pigs as pets and also as food and definitely now file zebra under the list of animals that cause happiness whether dead or alive! The waitress asked how I wanted this cooked and I wasn't sure, having never had this particular meat. She recommend medium rare and it was perfect this way. I didn't particularly care for the thinly shredded potato that came as the accompaniment (we ordered some kale and peri peri fries to share which were yum) but the zebra was amazing! It had a light, creamy taste and I'd had been happy paying full price (\u00a328) for this dish. We finished up with some chocolate tart which was nice but not particularly special or interesting. When the bill arrived, we saved about \u00a380 with the Taste Card - it came to \u00a350 each, with the puds being full price. We also had one glass of house red which really suited all the food. We then decided to do the rest of our drinking round the corner at 55. The atmosphere in the restaurant was generally quite good but I would have preferred some more obviously African music. The music itself felt quite generic in comparison to the amazing decoration in the place and all the beautiful carving detail (including in the seats, which are heavy and pretty). Shaka Zula definitely didn't disappoint. Although for the full price, it's definitely going to remain a rarity for me. The general exotic feel and grandeur is quite exciting and very much encapsulates the sort of events you think you'll attend all the time before realising the expense of London as an adult. I'd love to go back again soon (maybe with my parents who might splash out for one of those platters...) but on the advice of the bank manager, I'll still be relying on those cheaper local options....",

We arrived with no booking and were seated immediately. I'm talking about lunchtime on Christmas Eve so this probably isn't a good bellwether but the place is huge so I'm guessing it has to get pretty busy before you have to book. We kicked off with a couple of servings of biltong. The portion size wasn't huge but the three varieties (dro\u00ebwors, sliced biltong and chili snaps) were tasty and well presented. For me the whole point of visiting a restaurant like this is to try the indigenous cuisine, having dabbled quite heavily in South African meat dishes in the past I went for the Mouflon Haunch Steak as it was the only variety of may I hadn't previously tried, and very good it was too. I had buttered kale and piri piri fries as sides. The kale was to die for and the fries really hit the spot. Chloe had opted for fat chips and she was green with envy. It's not the cheapest, but the atmosphere and decor are really good and the food was up to a good standard. I'm not sure if I would choose this over Gilgamesh if I was only passing once, but I would certainly alternate between the two if I was in the area regularly.",

    "text": "On the positive side, this place has the novelty factor. If you want to be daring to impress a date (or some mates) then take them here and show off about how you are brave enough to try ostrich, springbok or even zebra.The decor is incredible. There are two floors of carved wooden tables and pillars and it feels like you're eating in an African Palace. For the decor alone this place is worth a visit and if I went again I would go for drinks rather than food. The cocktail menu is pricey but the drinks are satisfyingly strong and there's a Champagne and oyster bar if you're feeling flash.However, if you are at all fussy when it comes to food then you should stay away from Shaka Zulu. Also, it's not ideal if you are an animal lover as all types of zoo animals are on the menu and some would say they're better alive than dead.In fact, the cooking was not the best. Crocodile straws had more pastry than crocodile while the biltong made from some wild beast was hard and salty. Zebra was really really chewy, which made me upset that a zebra had died for this.Take my advice - go to the bar, have a cocktail, look at the food menu and then decide if you're brave enough to stay or whether you want to finish your night in another of Camden Town's fabulous dining establishments. In Camden Town, there are better options for food than Shaka Zulu.",

    "text": "Interesting place. \u00a0I would have to agree with the general tenor of some of the other reviews: \u00a01) The place itself is pure eye-candy and a sight to behold; but 2) The cuisine itself is lackluster for the price.Regarding the venue: \u00a0Carved wood, high ceilings and dramatic lighting all combine to make this restaurant an \"African-theme-on-steroids\". \u00a0It's definitely worth dropping by for drinks, or to show a friend something new.Regarding the food: The cocktails are fruity and fun. And the crocodile appetizer was the best thing we ordered. \u00a0But the other items...basically gazelle and wild bison...were both relatively flavorless, and both accompanied with the same slightly-sweet meat-sauce. \u00a0To be perfectly honest, I could barely tell the difference between one meat and the other. \u00a0They could have just as well been steak and lamb, for all I could detect. \u00a0There was definitely nothing particularly unique about either of their flavor, texture or preparation. \u00a0I assume it's because it's likely difficult to get 'fresh' game meat from Africa all the way in London.So, that's the basic score. \u00a0Good location and vibe, but mediocre food that is considerably overpriced. \u00a0Recommendation: \u00a0Go for happy hour, order some drinks and appetizers at the bar, and take in the setting. \u00a0You'll get 90% of the dinner-experience at 20% of the price. \u00a0 And if you want to really try some authentic, well-prepared game-food, use the money you saved to head over to \"Rules\" in Covent Garden.",

    "text": "I recently visited South Africa with my wife, to meet the majority of my family for the first time. It was such an amazing experience! So when we got invited to Shaka Zulu - a South African restaurant, with some friends we were really excited to give it a try.The first thing to note is it's size. Split over 2 (possibly 3?) floors, it is vast. It is also part restaurant, part nightclub, so don't be surprised if it ends up being a late night!The menu is quite exciting. From my experience 'braai-ing' with my Cape Town, South Africans do steak exceptionally, and there are 5 steaks available to order here. Ranging from run of the mill sirloin, through to the beastly T-bone; a proper South African steak!We were however, more tempted to try something a bit more exotic. We opted for Wildebeast Ham Hock and Snoek pat\u00e9 to start us off, with Zebra and Crocodile for our mains! We then rounded things off with a trio of African desserts, one of which was Koeksisters, a new favourite of mine.The food was all presented superbly and tasted very nice. So why only 3 stars you ask? Well...Our table was booked for 9pm, pretty late as it is, but we didnt actually get seated until 9.45pm. Our waiter was terse and impatient when we tried to navigate the exotic menu, at one time actually telling me to \"just pick something\".When we did choose what to eat, it tasted very nice, but we had to take their word for it that we were in fact eating what we ordered. The snoek pat\u00e9 could have easily been smoked mackerel, the zebra was great, but could have easily been beef. You get the picture. You also had to choose your side dishes separately, and pay about \u00a38 each for the privilege!Then there is the price in general. The final meal ended up being \u00a360 per head + drinks! That's a lot of money in my book, but considering how cheap everything seemed in South Africa because of the exchange rate, it was particularly difficult to swallow.",

    "text": "Great decor, but the compliments stop there.This place has received rave reviews from many people, but it's near enough the worse restaurant I've ever been in.Upon arriving, we handed in our Timeout voucher, and expected things to run smoothly from there. We were given menus and the staff took our orders. 10 minutes later, there was apparently a confusion and we were told that we were given the wrong menu for our deal. Convinced we were on the \"lastminute.com\" deal, there was no real choice, and we had to opt for 4 cocktails (which was correct), but instead of the two course menu, we could only get a sharing board. After some negotiation, we were told we could get two sharing boards.The food itself was not even average. The seafood had a fish that was too salty. The smoked salmon was decent enough, but requires no work on their part. The crab very fishy and not that great. The meat board was very boring. Just lamb samosas and some crocodile spring rolls. There was no real flavour to this. The cocktails that arrived were okay, but nothing special, and definitely not worth the \u00a311. Basically when you dine here, you're essentially paying for the decor. The staff were perfectly pleasant but there seemed to be all too much confusion. Honestly, if you going to offer multiple voucher deals, make sure you understand YOURSELF how these work. The real icing on the cake was the 12.5% service charge at the end. The voucher clearly stated that this was only applicable on any ADDITIONAL items ordered to the voucher deal. Since we hadn't ordered anything additional, and DIDNT get our expected two course meal, but some cheap sharing boards it left a bad after-taste. One of the waitresses noted our unhappiness and went to get the manager. However it appeared that they seemed to be understanding that they were in the wrong, and we quite rightly were spared the service charge.Honestly, even without the confusion and inability to honour the advertised TIMEOUT deal, the food and drink was nothing special. I will never be back, and would suggest if you want to experience the decor, which is quite stunning, just head to the bar for a quick drink. The food is disappointing to the max and at full price, terrible value for money.One to avoid. Seriously.",

But hay hoe. If you do go i would suggest the venison carpachio and the crusted kingklip. The place itself does look quiet cool but you can tell it's a night club at night in my opinion which I guess a can't complain about, seeing as that is what it is.
