I finally made it to the third baby Spuntino and the next day it was Da Polpo.It was a catch up with some food bloggers and we found ourselves heading to Da Polpo on the second day of its soft opening for lunch.

I could not help gushing about this to Russell when he passed by. MeatballsSpaghettini & meatballs \u00a37We got a mix of the lamb and mint and pork meatballs.

    "text": "Da Polpo in Covent Garden is the newest addition to the Polpo, Polpetto and Spuntino family of small/sharing plate eateries founded by the restaurateur Russell Norman. The concept is ingenious and has taken London by storm. No booking, bustling atmosphere, well prized small dishes to share and a different theme to each of the restaurants. While Spuntino serves fun and delicious American food, Polpo and Polpetto specialize on Venetian dishes. While there is overlap between the menus, Da Polpo has a clear focus on meatballs. I mean a restaurant for meatballs? How cool is this? While I enjoyed the food, it was not a culinary epiphany. What makes da Polpo special and certainly will make me return, is the atmosphere. You wouldn't go there for a romantic date but I don't think there is a better place to catch up with your girlfriends while sisterly sharing the plates as they arrive one after the other and getting comfortably tipsy on aperol spritz, cocktails or the cheap but very decent house wine. Not everything went absolutely smoothly at da Polpo on my visit, but considering that it has just opened these things are easy to forgive and will probably iron out over time. For example I don't like being served French baguette and having it presented as 'focaccia'. But well, it was free and I really enjoyed the creamy ricotta dip it came with. We tried 2 dishes of the 'Cicheti' (small dishes) section. I thought the Arancini (2.5), fried rice balls, were excellent, fluffy and light with the aromatic flavour of thyme. The other cicheto we tried was a joke actually, one little piece of fennel with a tiny sardine for 2 pounds seemed really bad value for money, especially considering that it didn't convince tastewise either.Arancini (2.5)Grilled Fennel and White Anchovy (2) The there came the meatballs. I have to admit I am not terribly keen on meatballs in general, but the da Polpo ones were very good. The Lamb and Mint Meatballs (5) were excellent while the Chickpea, Spinach and Ricotta (4.5) ones were drowned in so much tomato sauce that I have no idea how they actually tasted. I would have preferred them with a lighter sauce, maybe just with some butter or olive oil and some parmesan. Superb was the Zucchini, Chili and Mint Pizzetta (6). The thin, light and crusty base was covered by thin slices of zucchini and generously sprinkled with olive oil, mint and loads of fresh chili. The hot not the decorative sort. I would go back for this dish alone. The Chili and Garlic Prawns (6.5) which we ordered as da Polpo had run out of the highly praised fritto misto were totally indistinct and forgettable.Lamb and Mint (5) and Chickpea, Spinach and Ricotto (4.5) MeatballsZucchini, Chili and Mint Pizzetta (6)Garlic and Chili Prawns (6.5) The dessert menu didn't read terribly exciting but there was one dish that just screamed 'Try me, Try me' and this was the Nutella Pizzetta (5.5). Nutella is one of my all time guilty pleasure and just please never leave me alone with a full jar of it! The base was the same as for the savoury pizzette and the slightly salty taste went heavenly with the sweet and chocolaty nutella. Finished off with some hazelnuts on top this was a very moreish dessert indeed. Disappointing was the other dessert we tried. The tiramisu (4.5) was just bland. Most people whose da Polpo reviews or comment I read complaint about the loud music and so did my dinner companions. I loved it though and for me the music certainly contributed to how much I enjoyed my evening there. But of course not everyone might be equally pleased with e.g. a rarely played David Bowie song Overall I preferred the food at Spuntino, it was certainly more 'special', but da Polpo is the place you want to spend a whole evening at. Ordering and eating and drinking and ordering more until you leave, happy and drunk. For photos please refer to hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026",

    "text": "It was a dark and stormy (well, drizzly...) night, and the bitter October cold chilled my bones as I walked through an abandoned Covent Garden by the light of the moon. As I happened down an eerie pathway called Maiden Lane, which was marked by only a few shopfronts and a large sign bearing a series of strange red maple leaves (I believe it pertained to a Canadian-themed pub, which explains its strangeness), a feeling of ominous foreboding hung thick in the air. As I continued to wander down this misshapen street, I was drawn in by a curious portrait of an octopus that decorated the window of an unidentifiable canteen of some sort, titled \"Polpo.\" I entered the mysterious location and was greeted by the comforting sights of Venice and the familiar scents of rich tomato sauce, garlic, and sage -- and I knew at once that I was safe from any impending danger threatened by the unsympathetic elements. Er...come to think of it, that wasn't exactly how things went. Braved the rain to meet a family friend for dinner at Polpo last night, and was really very impressed with both the quality of service and food that we enjoyed here. Since the restaurant is a bit small on its ground level (I've heard the underground basement area is quite nice, though), the seating arrangement was rather cramped, and we were essentially sharing a dinner table with the three or four other groups of people surrounding us. While I didn't mind that much for the most part, it was a little awkward to see other people gawking at/commenting on our food when it came before theirs (and vice versa, I'm sure). But I suppose that's an indication of gawk-and-comment-worthy food, to begin with, which is always a good thing! To preface my review of the food, I'd like to point out that Polpo serves Venetian cuisine, and in a family style manner to share (so my non-veg friend was veg for the evening as well). Traditionally, the food of Venice isn't really too veggie-friendly, favoring a lot of seafood and meat dishes, but the server who helped us out last night was careful to go through each menu item, as well as the daily specials, to identify what was suitable for my dietary preferences. \u00a0We ended up choosing a variety of small plates (priced very reasonably between \u00a35-10 each), including an order of arancini (breaded and fried risotto balls), two pizzettes (wild mushroom and spinach and soft egg, respectively), and a plate of \"meat\"balls made of chickpeas, spinach, and ricotta. While everything was (warm, which was key after nearly freezing from the ice-rain outside,) well-constructed, and extremely tasty, the spinach and soft egg pizza was a clear winner in my mind -- rather than being placed on a traditional red sauce, the spinach was mixed with cheese and spices, and piled in a thick paste atop the crispy dough base. This was then topped with a perfectly soft-boiled egg, which broke nicely and oozed out onto the pizza in a way that would make even the raunchiest food-porn enthusiasts blush. The chickpea \"meat\"balls were also rather good, but reminded me a bit of a North Indian \"kofta\" (and hence, threw me off a bit) in the similar use of chickpea flour and the fried dumpling technique used to cook them. While the cheese and dessert selection looked delicious (both on the menu and on the tables surrounding ours!), my friend and I decided to save it for our next trip to the restaurant.All in all, I left Polpo very pleased, full, and dry...although not for long, as it was still raining as we left (boo).",

This Italian restaurant is a bit disconcerting at first sight with a very short menu to choose from but things clear up very quickly as the helpful waiters help you make your mind and explain that almost everything can be combined and shared between guests at the same \u00a0table to create an intimate tasting experience. \u00a0I must say I'm not particularly fond of food sharing but my family is so it was not an easy sell to convince me but, in the end, the result was great. There is nothing at Polpo over 14 \u00a3 so, even with starters and drinks, it should normally end up around 80-100 pounds for a party of four. The food is more than palatable and presented in a simple way (no fancy plates or cutlery). The place is small so tables are very close to each other meaning that the noise level can sometimes be an annoyance. All in all not a bad food experience!",

I was hoping to walk away and go to someone \"make sure you go to Polpo and get... \" But I can't. I would still recommend this place to go if you are in the area and especially if you want a quick small bite before a show, as the food does come out quick, but don't go out of your way for a full dinner as the bill can quickly rack up if you get more than a couple of dishes each to share.The staff were great and as we sat at the bar we could always grabs someone's attention.

Fear not I had a brilliant dining experience from soup to nuts with a friendly and easy going staff that made you feel comfortable from the start. The small, 2 floor space is very casual and to be honest the seats were not that comfortable, not that I noticed after I began sipping my Aperol Spritz. The menu is divided between different small tapas styled dishes including small pizzas and even a section for meatballs. It makes for easy tasting and exploration of several dishes and you can add as you go along depending how hungry you are. I started with the light fluffy arancini -rice balls stuffed with cheese. Some of the best I've ever had! Followed with the pizza Bianca and a plate of spicy sausage meatballs. All absolutely fabulous. Finished with the light almond and orange flourless cake which became the perfect ending to an extraordinary meal. I will definitely going back again and again and again...",

    "text": "Quick glance:+ friendly staff+ cozy ambiance for catchup with friends+ yummy meatballs and steak- West-end London prices- come early or queue!I came here for a quick dinner with a friend before an evening workshop nearby and was pleasantly surprised by the \"depth\" of the restaurant stretching into the back and the many empty tables when we arrived at 6:30pm. The restaurant quickly filled up though, and an hour later when we left the place was in full swing. The waiter who served us was eccentrically dressed but he couldn't be any nicer. In fact, most of the staff were very friendly, greeting us on the way in and out. The food itself was \u00a0good, although I think it depends highly on what you order. The bresaola, rocket & parmesan 'pizzette', a miniature pizza, \u00a0was not particularly spectacular in taste despite the combination of great ingredients. However, the classic meatball was succulent and juicy, while the sliced flank steak in white truffle cream was melt-in-the-mouth tender. It is a bit pricey to say they are tapas, but the portion size is bigger than your typical tapas dishes you get from, say, La Tasca or even Brindisa. And overall, it was a great place to hang out with a friend, or even a casual date, over some tasty food and a selection of wine, beers, and cocktails.",

    "text": "Polpo has been on my to visit list for quite a while but it's not exactly the kind of place you'd go to every week as it has a strict no reservations policy. The best way I can describe it is Italian tapas. Lots of amazing Italian dishes meant to be shared.They recommend two to three plates per person and we ended up ordering seven which was just the right amount for us and luckily we both seemed to have similar tastes. There are no starters or mains everything just comes as and when it's ready.The first dish we tried was the fried stuffed olives. Oh my god, whose idea was it to fry olives and oh my god can I kiss them?! Although there were only four of these they were huge beasts of things and absolutely divine. I could definitely have eaten a whole portion of this to myself. Next out was the crab & chickpea crostini along with the fritto misto - lightly battered mixed seafood including octopus, squid, anchovies. The crostini was very nice with a generous portion of topping to bread ratio but the fried fish was simply amazing. It was a light batter, almost tempura style and it was just lovely. The linguine vongole - spaghetti with clams - was bursting with clams but a few of the shells were broken and I got bits in my mouth which was a bit unpleasant but to be expected when you're eating shellfish. The proscuitto, smoked mozzarella & rocket pizette was probably my least favourite of the lot but that's not to say that it wasn't delicious it's just that the rest of the food was so good. By this point I was starting to feel a little full and as a plate of classic beef & pork meatballs and spaghettini was placed in front of us it looked like a challenge but the meat was cooked to perfection that it wasn't a chore. Finally we had the chilli & garlic prawns, one of my favourite things ever and I'm kind of glad these were saved for last as they were without a doubt the best dish. Six huge succulent king prawns with their shells still on. Mmm... I'm salivating just thinking about it!Lovely atmosphere and perfect service, I can't wait to return!",

    "text": "Another restaurant from Russell Norman, the man behind Polpo, Polpetto and Spuntino, this time in Covent Garden. Having found out that they were going to open 3 days earlier than planned and offer 50% on those days I quickly booked a table for a late lunch. Lunch requires a booking but if you're going for dinner no reservation is required but be prepared that it might be completely packed. Seating 70 da Polpo feels a lot bigger than its cousins. Spread across two floors it has two counters to sit around in addition to the tables. Interior wise it reminds me of Polpo a lot. Light and airy interior. The menu is mostly about pizzettas and meatballs. The pizzettas are recognisable from the other restaurants. I decided to try the bianca, this was probably the highlight for me, lovely thinly sliced onion on a thin very well made mini pizza and the pork shoulder and pickled pepper one which had some really nice tender pork and pieces of chilli peppers with a mere hint of spiciness. In the meatball section were a few different flavours such as the classic beef and pork, spicy pork and fennel and lamb and mint. There is also the piadina option which can be served with any of the meatballs that you want. Deciding on the classic beef and pork ones the piadina came out nicely crispy but not too hard or dry with a filling of meatballs and tomato sauce. This could easily had been heavy or soggy but was very nice and light. Next dishes were from the plates section. The grilled asparagus with buttered eggs and parmesan had a wonderful grilled flavour with a bit of saltiness coming from the parmesan. This is a dish I will definitely have again without hesitation. The thin-cut sirloin on the other hand was the let down of the meal. Very tender, it seemed to lack seasoning and really needed something extra, perhaps some sauce, to really bring it together. The fennel, curly endive and almond salad was very light but just slightly oily. Nice as a contrast to the other dishes though. Remembering the 50% off it felt necessary to squeeze in one last dish before moving on to dessert. Feeling finished with the meatballs, greens and pizzettas it was time to have some seafood. Garlic and chilli prawn it was. Within a few minutes came a small bowl with prawns on top of a few leaves of green with lots of garlic and a chilli heat to the oil it was cooked in. One of the better dishes if you like seafood. The desserts includes the excellent tiramisu and a very nice but too small affogato. In conclusion, da Polpo may not bring much new to the formula but it does it very well so I can't really complain.",

    "text": "I love Polpo! I've met friends for dinner here a few times, and it's super handy if you're going to see something at the Royal Opera House just the other side of Covent Garden. It's perfect for a pre-show/theatre nibble as at 6ish the queue is pretty minimal, whereas it is always out of the door when we leave. I'm a huge fan of sharing platters of food- give me tapas, dim sum or meze over one meal any day, and so I love this Venetian-esque bar with the option of ordering lots of dishes to share, or to start with a glass of wine and nibble and order as the night goes on. I really like the anchovy and chickpea crostini- like a perfect, more interesting houmous on toast, the anchovy adding a deeply savoury, interesting flavour. At \u00a33 they're a nice nibble before the rest of your food arrives. I've found the arancini slightly disappointing the couple of times I've had it, but maybe I've just been spoilt by the Arancini Brothers. Other favourites include the spinach, parmesan and soft egg pizzette (\u00a37.5) which is utterly delicious, the frito misto, which is fairly expensive at \u00a39.50 but is a huge portion and is perfectly cooked, and grease free. The salads are always great- blood orange, radiccio and walnut is perfect to cut though some of the richer dishes, but my absolute favourite has to be the fennel, almond and endive (5) on my last visit I would've been quite happy to eat only this!Polpo are famed for their meatballs but so far I've only tried their veggie offering- chickpea, spinach and ricottta, served in a rich tomato sauce. Yummy, but possibly the only slightly underwhelming thing on the menu. The house wines are good, and my Manhattan was delicious. We've never had time (or room) for a proper dessert, but the intriguing sounding chocolate salami (3) were really tasty and were the perfect end to a lovely meal. It can be pricey, but order carefully and you can have a great value meal in the always touristy area of Covent Garden. I'll be back next time I go to see the Royal Ballet.",

Who needs reservations anyway? Their approach to it is 'we don't hurry in Venice - we take life in and enjoy it' - therefore no pressure to leave the table at the end of your time slot, no need to call in early - just pure luck - if you're early they'll fix you up with a seat really quick!",

    "text": "Da Polpo is the fourth outpost from restaurateur Russell Norman and closer to the Beak Street original in size and atmosphere than the middle, smaller two. The bare walls, industrially salvaged furniture and fittings and dim lighting remain a common theme. I'm beginnning to think that Norman has shares in one of the reclaimation companies, or alternatively is manufacturing former industrial shabby chic from scratch, extruding it out by the roomful in a dark pit of indentured workers somewhere in a former Soviet state.The service is bright, funky and considerably more tattooed than yours truly, the sparse and snacky drinks and food menus appears on clipboards and as artfully recycled placemats and even at 9:30 on a wet and windy Wednesday they still having trouble seating you. So far, so fair for another Norman conquest.We arrived and grabbed a seat at the downstairs bar which meant we got to eat sooner, though did leave us feeling like we were in an East German factory canteen. The lighting is low, the murmur was loud but the smell from the kitchen was divine... Perched at the battered zinc bar (another division in the owner's manufacturing empire no doubt) we kicked back with an Aperol spritz and perused the familiar menu.We went on recommendation in the end, a selection from the different sharing plates littering the list, happy enough to chat and take the suggestions of the cool but knowledgable staff. Starting and finishing with rounds of arrancia, little hot shotputts of risotto rice round a molten mozzarella core, fried with a crisp toothsome breadcrumb crust. Textbook examples of a relatively simple bar snack, you'd be slightly pissed if you queued an hour for one, but better than a rather plain chicken liver crostini, too much pate with that drying sensation of the meat left it a little cloying in the mouth, less would have been more here.The nearest to a main in size was a shared plate of Frito Misto, seafood selection (in reality 95% of it was prawns, calamari and whitebait) competently deep fried, maintaining the integrity of the fish without being doused in oil, though oddly served without an aoili to cut through the crumb. It may be authentic, but the lemon wedge didn't do enough to lift it from dryness. Better still was the pork shoulder pizzette, one of 6 or 7 baby pizzas, a smear of rich pasata covering the small, crisp base with thin slices of smoky marbled shoulder, all cut through with piquant peppers. Having eaten similar recently, cooked by a local Italian mama from a pizza oven facing the open air, I can attest to the authenticity of these little plate shaped platters of goodness.Like the other branches, the meatballs are excellent. Not afraid to bring up the accompanying herbs, fennel in the case of the ones we went for, they're punchy cannonballs of well seasoned meat. the seasoned tomato sauce a great accompaniment and, after another round of those arrancia (OK, maybe they are worth waiting for when served hot and fresh, dripping with mozz) we stumbled off into the night.So is anything really different to the other branches of the 'chain'? And does it matter when the quality is high enough? While there's an element of Norman by Numbers about Da Polpo, for the neighbourhood (deepest, darkest touristic Covent Garden) it's nice to have another option in the area, though by the time you've waited for a table, there'll be another one along to take the crowd.",

Then on our trip back from Edinburgh, saw a write up of Da Polpo on British Airway's inflight magazine...and that sealed the deal. Oddly, you can't make reservations (i prefer a sure thing) after 6p. Also, it's kinda hard to find this place...the numbering system is odd and we walked up and down Maiden St a couple of times and almost gave up before walking smack into it. they need better signage. i almost chewed my own arm off from hunger. Great ambience- perfect for a wine bar/ tapas place. Prices were fairly resonable as wellArancini: yummy. could do with more cheese?!Croquettes: yumPizza: Definitely need to brown the crust a little more. it was whiter than a Brit in the winter. looked rather unappetizing, but luckily, tasted goodChili Garlic Prawns: great flavorWe had a couple other plates which i don't remember but they were good.

The place has an excellent vibe- which might be why it's still popular. My family is Italian so I know a bit about Italian food and I can tell you the faults1. I had to send my Aperol spritz back to the bar because all I could taste was soda, this is an Italian restaurant for goodness sakes.2. On my last visit I was adding salt and pepper to everything. The osso bucco with risotto- risotto had no flavor. Lamb was cold. The cod cheeks with lamb needed salt.

None the less no real complaints. Stuffed olives- lightly fried and stuffed with anchovy paste. Delicious nibble. Chicken- fried and breaded cutlet, similar to chicken Milanese. Hearty. Zucchini salad- with Parmesan. Nice green side dish. Classic meat balls- mild sauce. Needed a bit more flavor but overall good. Rabbit paparadelle- dissapointing. Lacked enough meat. Rounded out with affogotos all around, which never disappoint. The atmosphere was new rustic and the service was fine. Never rushed. Happy to have tried this place.",

I ordered the crab and chili linguine and when it first came out it looked and smelled delicious. But the first bite was just so disappointing. The taste just wasn't there and the linguine was mediocre at best. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing? I'm not sure, but I definitely wouldn't get what I got today a second time. I might be willing to come back and try another dish though, just because I loved the environment so much (and also because the price is very reasonable - my dish was around 8 pounds and definitely filled me up).",

Its a similar concept to Tapas with lots of small meals which you share around the table. I had the spaghetti with meatballs which was great. I also had the cauliflower cheese which was really nice. The service was also really good. I will definitely come back!",

    "text": "I've always wanted to go to Polpo, I don't know why it's emblem has failed to beckon me in before? I love Octopus!It's insignias eight curled tendrils on the door is like Ursula the tempting sea bewitcher herself, beckoning you in with inviting tentacles. This time, seduced by a need for seafood spaghetti, my dinner dates and I were spellbound by sounds of trilling jollity within, the clattering of cicchetti \u00a0plates and the clinking of carafes against small glasses.During a late diner service, crewed by a sea of attendants, we were shown to an intimate spot out back and made to appreciate our servers powers for accommodating us at such a time.Gratefully seated whilst the table was cleared and reset, I eagerly scanned the paper-table-mat-menu for what my heart desired; I only had eyes for Octopi. However, I did not find Octopus on Polpo's menu, yes, Polpo which means Octopus, which is advertised on it's image outside. It was the very marketing of this cephalopod that enchanted me in. Wanting to scream out about the whereabouts of this absent item on the menu, I thought about quietly remarking that they'd forgot to include the Octopops? Where the devil was this fish? But I felt like my voice had been stolen. I could have read the menu outside. Silly me. In flickering candlelight it was hypnotically dark, murky almost, like being at the bottom of an ocean, sunken like my bereft heart. It was so dark in-fact it was hard to see the specials board. Our server also failed to bring this to our attention, so perhaps a not-so-specials board after all. It was illegible from where I was sitting and from what I could make out, squinting in the squinky dim light, \u00a0there was a bottle of something at the top of the list for \u00a362. I flicked my eyes back into my skull and over to my dinner date's direction where the news was confirmed, my fears confounded, there was no Octopus on the specials board. Placated temporarily with a good Gibson Martini, I chewed on my picked onion whilst waiting for our order. Ogling others food, in-between trying to maintain polite conversation, my vexation was further piqued seeing waitresses stuff brushettas into their bouches behind the counter right next to us, whilst we waited what seemed an inordinate time for our food to arrive. When our food did arrive, we chose a great flavoursome selection; \u00a0I'd like to say virtuous linguine vongole, but dangerously spiked fennel meatballs, pretty pea-shoot, peach mozzarella Panfocaccia and although delicious, a poor substitute; cuttle fish risotto. Learning of Polpo's Octoplethora; another 8 arms branching across London, it might be fairly enchanting to dine here, but I shall not be suckered back until Polpo has pitched up tentacles on it's menus.",

The Crocchette was fine enough, but it's not really for me. The Fried Olives were a real hit. \u00a0My wife really enjoyed these - firm and the filling was a flavour burst. \u00a0My favourite was the Peach Bruschetta: the mozzarella, the crunch of the bread and the freshness of the peach (juicy, not floury - as you sometimes get). \u00a0Our last small dish was the Mackerel tartare which also went down well.For our 'mains', I preferred the pork pizzetta - good comfort food, I could have folded this up into 4 and eaten it all at once. As for the lamb caponata, the vegetables were nice; I liked the saltiness of the capers. \u00a0But, the lamb was average.We washed our food down with two Bellinis and two moretti beers. I had the latter.Similar to the sister restaurants, I like the casual atmosphere and the vibe. We sat at the bar which is a great place to position yourself. You are never far from anyone's attention to order another drink or plate of food.",

The venue is small enough to make you feel uncomfortably packed in with seating stools too diminutive to ever be at ease. \u00a0It doesn't feature the artfully peeled paint and battered wood d\u00e9cor as seen in the Soho branch. Things are aesthetically much more stripped back here, much to my disappointment. If you're in the area walk the extra 10 minutes to Beak St have a much more rewarding time.",

We were a big group of 6 so we ordered quite a few dishes and these are my MUST orders- Aracini, Smoked Salmon Crostini, Bianca Pizzette, and Flank Steak. They were AMAZING. I definitely recommend getting a ton of dishes and sharing as a group. They also have an awesome wine/cocktail/beer collection with options for everyone!

    "text": "Russell Norman's fourth restaurant opening in a matter of years is hands down his finest yet - and nestles nicely into the existing portfolio with what he deems a focus on Italian comfort food.To me, that doesn't give enough credit to the intricacies of the menu, but it definitely sums up the welcoming atmosphere and fantastic service.Many of the best dishes on Polpo's menu (Norman's first bacaro, located in Soho) have made it onto its sister's menu, including the parmesan and potato crochette, fennel salad with almonds - and an extended pizette section that now includes several variations of the original bianco dish. We had zucchini, mint and chilli, which absolutely blew me away. Who knew that flavour combination would work? Who cares, the team at da POLPO did. Make sure you try it.Additionally there's a new section of meatballs (polpette) in varying flavours, which I'm happy to see as I recently went to Venice and ate at the place Norman says inspired Polpo in the first place. At da POLPO, we had the classic beef and pork, which were larger than you'd imagine and very tasty indeed. Meaty, rich and served with a beautiful tomato sauce.The sirloin (covered in a bed of rocket to rest when it arrived at the table), melted in the mouth - and the garlic/chili prawns were plentiful in their number and in terms of taste. Then the desserts. My god. da POLPO's cherry ice cream was, without hesitation, the best I've ever had. It arrived in a long stemmed waffle cone, and was just delicious. We also tried the tiramisu pot, which was equally yummy. Perfectly combining cream, espresso and cakey-deliciousness in just the right sized glass.So, I'm a fan. The two floors make it the largest (perhaps not in covers, but definitely in atmosphere) of the Polpo group. Light, airy and with a definite sense of space all round, I enjoyed my dinner immensely. Quick service and the usual bit of personality from the team made it a wonderful night. I'll be back as soon as possible.",

Straight from Italian ambient music to trance to Missy Elliott to Latin cumbia music. What. The. Heck. Cons: - server was very rude when we asked if there was any octopus (given the restaurants name. When my husband asked if there was any polpo, the server very rudely stated \"do you even know what polpo is?\"). Apparently octopus is seasonal (despite them living in the ocean with no seasons...)- Server judged us on what plates we picked. Apparently our choices were very dry \u200d- The funny affected Italian accent when she'd repeat our order back to us was hilarious. - We also observed her telling off an elderly man for leaving his cutlery in such a way that indicated he was done if he wasn't actually done. - The classic meatballs were very tough and tasted of spice and fennel which the server very clearly told me was impossible as the spicy fennel meatballs were a different shape and different color coded toothpick. Who knows. As you can see a lot of this came down to the server. Maybe they had a bad night... I certainly hope so. Ambience was cool (although you'd think hankies as lampshades is a bit of a fire hazard...) and food and drink were fine. There's just so many better places to go.",

My only qualm is that the tables are soooo close together, I was basically having a conversation with both tables on either side of me.",

Then we walked in and came immediately for orders and the service was fast. we all had pizzas, i tried spinach with permisano cheese and egg which i thought was okish, fried gnocchi which i didnt liked and my friends had margarita, it tasted fairly good and it comes in small plate as a portion for one person only. We also had coffee and i really liked it. Overall, nice restaurant, fast and good food service but maybe book your table in advance and food was decent, but we only tried their pizza and gnocchi.",

    "text": "We visited there on a few Saturdays ago at 20:00. \u00a0The place was packed and it stayed busy throughout our stay.The staff were very friendly and chatty, and we really had a great time.Salt Cod Crochette had flaky cod and had wonderful texture.Fritto Misto had crispy calamari, a bit of prawns, and anchovies. \u00a0The first two were absolutely gorgeous, but they were a bit too salty and I wasn't keen on the anchovies.White Anchovy Pizzetta was one of the two disappointing dishes. \u00a0It was a small pizza with just anchovies (skins and tail attached) and smoked mozarella, which lacked flavour and was not worth \u00a37. Escaped Birds were skewered chicken, liver, panchetta, courgetts, etc. beautifully grilled.Pork & Fennel Meatballs were flavourful and tasty.Herbed Polenta was the best polenta I'd tasted, \u00a0It was crunchy outside and soft inside, and was full of flavour.Lamb Neck was way too garlicky and sinewy. \u00a0This was one of the two dishes which were disappointing.Tiramisu Pot was the adult version of Tiramisu. \u00a0It had the proper bitterness from cocoa and dark chocolate.Pannacotta was flawless. \u00a0The texture was perfect and it wasn't too sweet. \u00a0It had a lovely refreshing strawberries on top. \u00a0You really need to order this.Lemon Cake was huge and came with lovely sweetened cream.We ended our fantastic evening with Royal Tokaji Late Harvest which symbolised their menu very well - quality!It was obvious that they had capable chefs who prepared dished with great care and skills, and they used the best quality ingredients. \u00a0The bill came to \u00a395 (including a small glass of Royal Tokaji but without other wine or alcohol). \u00a0It was worth it for the fun we had chatting with the staff and for trying something new. \u00a0I am happy to go back to try other dishes.",

    "text": "Polpo is a cute Italian place in Covent Garden, that is great for couples or a small group of four. I don't think they do reservations, but there is a bar, therefore quite convenient to pass time before they find a free table for you.The concept is all about sharing. They offer small plates of different kinds (fish, meatballs, seafood etc) that are great to share and they come once they are ready. If you don't want to overeat, 3 plates \u00a0are enough for a couple to share.We had 2 pizzettas: one with spinach, another one with tiny prawns and capers. \u00a0We also went for chilli garlic prawns, that were my favourites.For dessert we shared a tiramisu, altough it was too small for sharing, but delicious! \u00a0Staff was very attentive: I wasn't sure what was chocolate salami, therefore they just brought it out for me to try. In summary, very nice place. Recommended!",

    "text": "I like the idea of tapas, but I wasn't expecting it at an Italian restaurant. It is extremely expensive to come here if you are hungry. Two pasta plates and one order of arancini (two small balls) plus two glasses if wine came out to \u00a345. We decided to leave and ended up getting burgers (that were amazing). The people were extremely nice, and the beef ragu with rigatoni was delicious but had exactly 10 pieces of rigatoni and two scoops of ragu. The clam and Chili Linguine had no crab, but definitely tasted fishy (pun intended), and the arancini were tiny and needed seasoning. \u00a0Mediocre glass of Montepulciano for \u00a38, which a good glass should be \u00a35 at most. Left hungry and feeling meh!",

Service was surprisingly efficient and friendly as people came to check on us after we found our seats near the bar. I was surprised as I'd heard mixed reviews about service in London in general.I thought the energy and mood-lit space was befitting of a wine bar and go-to spot for a second date in any metropolitan city in the Western world. (No, it's not meant to be a wine bar but that is the vibe here.)The food itself was just so-so. The pork belly was the toughest I've had anywhere. We needed steak knives to cut through the meat and some focused chewing. The squid ink risotto was fun to try but very neutral flavor profile and on the watery side. I've had inky carbs before and don't think this dish did the ingredient justice.Overall a fun, pleasant experience to catch-up with a friend or a date. I wouldn't say the food was the star here but the atmosphere overall is nice.Bonus: Full coffee menu (or at least they serve lattes and cappuccinos)",

    "text": "I'm actually not 100% a fan of Polpo, but I guess overall it is a good standard and due to the way we ordered (not sharing! argh!) I didn't have the chance to sample as many of its dishes as I would have liked.Pork and fennel meatballs tasted pretty good (could have been spicier) although they really are huge and very heavy and filling if you end up eating two like I did. The duck ragu was also well done although didn't blow me away. I wouldn't necessarily order it again because I prefer the texture of minced meat in ragu rather than more stew like bits of meat (I don't like stew, although this meat was very well cooked) but I'm glad I tried something different. I loved the arancini, they are always my favourite.Prosecco and cocktails came in shockingly terrible retro/hipster glasses. I really don't approve of drinking delicate and expensive alcoholic beverages out of glasses meant for juice, soda, flowers, or preserves. However I can't deny the general aesthetic of the restaurant is quite pleasing (except for the hideously ugly and unnecessarily huge flight of stairs right as you come in). I thought I would never get to eat at one of the Polpo restaurants because they are reputedly tiny with massive queues but this location is pretty big so on a quiet night you shouldn't have to wait very long, especially if you are happy to eat at the bar. Too bad they don't have a better waiting space (Flatiron still rules on that front).",

It gets busy but the atmosphere remains relaxing. The staff are happy, friendly and very helpful. Service is great and prompt.Because the dishes are smaller and it's recommended that two people share five dishes. It's uncomplicated, simple yet flavoursome food. It's about \u00a335 per person so it's not cheap, but the price is very reasonable for the quality and service for around Covent Garden. #greedymoo #londonfoodie #foodporn #polpo",
