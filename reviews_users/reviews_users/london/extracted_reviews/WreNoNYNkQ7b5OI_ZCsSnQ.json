Waitreses were very pleasant and helped with suggestions on the Cuban food. It was happy hour, two cocktails for the price of one. So felt it was a great deal on the drinks. Food was fine too and all reasonably priced. I would go back there again for a more leisurely meal and experiment.",

Large selection of tequilias on offer and generally a quite extensive cocktail list. Prices aren't super cheap, but considering you're in the heart of Waterloo, they aren't half-bad either. Great for parties or just some fun times with a couple of friends. They offer theme nights and things like salsa-dancing lessons & real Cuban cigars for sale.",

There is seating staggered on different levels and you can also sit outside in good weather.

    "text": "My friend reserved a table here to celebrate her birthday, and we ended up having such a great time. As soon as you walk in, you feel like you're in the middle of Cuba, with Spanish music playing in the background, and a very South American atmosphere. It's filled with colourful paintings and wall sculptures, which include a massive gun, unloaded of course. The interior is bright and florescent with wooden furnishings to give it an authentic Cuban feel. I also sensed that the place had regular Cuban bar-goers who were friends with the South American waitresses. The dishes include tapas, tortilla, falafel, and very traditional Cuban dishes, which were not only tasty but very spicy! So take my advice and make sure you ask how hot the meals are before ordering. The cost for Cuban cuisine and alcohol were reasonable with cocktail jugs at \u00a315 and coffee with rum from \u00a34. They even had chocolate cake, which I must say was extremely sweet. However, there were a couple of down sides such as the main course menu, which wasn't vegetarian friendly. If you don't believe me, check the website as it is kind enough to have its menu uploaded online. Also, it's very loud and crowded by 9pm, particularly on a Saturday, where every one tries to dance to Salsa in such a confined space.",

It was really the service that got me. Shall I count the ways?10 were the 2-tops that were open when I arrived. Yet, you refused to seat me at any of them claiming they were reserved. Despite an entirely empty restaurant, you put us between two other tables, with 6 inches on either side. In an empty restaurant. Why is that you reserve the tables for the groups that are sharing a \u00a315 jug, when my group of two that you completely shafted on tables spent three times that? I also saw you seat a number of people without reservations at these so-called \"reserved\" tables.6 were the inches between our table and the two on either side of us. It was fun, at least, to find out what first dates were like again because I got to hear two up close and personal. 7 were the tables that were still empty 90 minutes later when we left. Reservations, my ass.30 were the minutes that I waited for my starter, which ended up arriving after my main. Despite me pleading with the waitress for it.1/2 was the flan that you gave me. A flan mold is pretty small generally, so to find that you empty them, cut them in half and serve was heartbreaking.4 was the bites of flan I managed to eke out of my meager dessert. 2 was the times I had to ask for my bill.12.5% was the service charge you tried to hit me with after giving me the worse service I've had in this price range in a long time.1 for the first time I've EVER refused to pay a discretionary service charge. I actually think you must be taking the piss--no one in their right mind would go back here unless they were so hopped up on mojitos that they didn't remember it clearly. I'd love to love you, you're so conveniently located and I love minty drinks. But seriously, fire your waitresses. Or teach them about seating. Maybe you provide a good bar-only experience but for a dinner date? Avoid avoid avoid.Love,LIna",

Considerably cheap for the area and for what they have to offer, I would reccomend this place to groups of friends wanting to have a raucous meal out. They take bookings for up to six people which is advisable.I would reccomend some of the chicken dishes, spiced to perfection, and then the traditional coconut tart, heaven on the tastebuds. Don't stuff yourself too much though, as you will need to leave some breathing space to dance later on.The cocktails are really good, of course you should drink Cuba Libre. The atmosphere of the place is wild and authentic, the crowd is genuine and bonafide and everyone just wants to have a good time. If you are looking for a change from the normal London scene, then I would seriously advise that you give this place a good visit, maybe even plan a whole night, starting with a meal, moving onto drinkies and ending on your feet having a jive.",

The staff seemed a bit confused about the special, but in the end it all worked out. By 8 o'clock on a thursday the place was humming with activity. We grabbed a couple of tables for ten in the corner just to the left of the entrance which also made a great place for people watching. (There was a very tall woman who had hunched shoulders. We surmised it must be because she always has to lean over to talk to people). The seating is arranged on several different levels, each separated by a few stairs. It is a great layout to give an overall sense of activity and vibe, but still allows groups to have a bit of their own space. It is conveniently located just a 200 meter walk from the entry to waterloo train and tube station.",

The cocktails were good but the tables are quite cramped due to the interesting shape of the building, lots of chairs wedged into nooks and crannies. We loved the decor, and felt inspired to join the Spanish revolution, fortunately for us it was over. The bar staff said they'd bring our cocktail over once it was ready and then tried to charge us an extra 2 quid for table service we hadn't asked for, so don't agree to them bringing you your drinks, wait at the bar for them. The upstairs bathroom was fine but the downstairs ladies appeared to have been host to some sort of pitched battle as several things were broken. We seem to have gone on the wrong night for music, only the echo of a dodgy electric keyboard playing Auld Lang Syne. It was shortly after New Year.",

Main courses range from about \u00a36.00, i tried the Garbanzos Grillios with Chirozo - this was a chickpea stew with garlic and coriander and simply oozed flavour. The cocktails were fresh and very, very tasty (from what we can remember), especially those with lashings of fresh crushed mint leaves - buy the pitchers they work out better value. After dinner the restaurant becomes part of the bar with live music. Well worth staying around for after you've eaten. One tip - wear as little as possible this place gets very, very warm.",

They refused to seat us when we arrived 20 minutes late although we called and were told that the table would wait for us.Twice the service wasn't good. I am not blaming it on the waitresses, they clearly have a lot on their plate.The second time I was even charged for something we did not order.Having said that, I must admit the food is pretty good. I mean, let's be honest, there are no plenty of choices in Cuba, so you can't expect that here. The ropa vieja is simply the best dish they serve. Really good, great portions and filling. The prawns are also one of my favourites as so are the croquettes. I even ordered the vegetarian plate and was ok although a bit dry.The drinks are really good. I would say I had the best mojitos outside Cuba, but they are a bit overpriced. Not too bad considering they are freshly made :)After eleven you can move your body with the latin music, which is really nice.Don't expect a lot from the service, have some patience and enjoy the music and the atmosphere. Also good it you want to hire one spaces to celebrate a birthday.",

    "text": "Cubana is the simpler version of Floridita and I say that with all the love I can muster for a bar. Which, as it turns out, is quite a bit. As the name suggests, it's a Cuban themed bar and they do it well. On most nights, you can expect a lively atmosphere, some colourful decorations, and mojitos galore. But what really gets it going are the live acts on the weekends! The last time I was there, the band was composed of three middle aged guys that looked as if they had just strolled in off the streets of Havana. They were exceptional musicians and had the whole place dancing up a storm in short order. Unlike Floridita, where it seems that everyone is a professional salsa dancer, Cubana attracts the more amateur crowd and you can muddle your way through the basic steps without feeling too awkward. And after a few of the \u00a317 mojito pitchers, it's unlikely that you'll give a damn and just go for it! They also have some crazy bright green drink (something Alligator) which looks ridiculous, tastes delicious, and has enough of a punch to floor an elephant.The minor gripe I have is the lack of dancing space given the various rooms and levels the bar is divided into. You can make do, but you're constantly dancing around the stream of people trying to make it to the bathroom or the bar. Still, given the fairly cheap drinks prices, the excellent music, and the great location next to Waterloo station, it's an easy win!.",

    "text": "Some people hate this place. Personally, I can't see why. Is it a corporate re-badging of a quirky Cuban food concept? Possibly but the folks were friendly, the food was very tasty and the restaurant was a pleasant interior decorated in bright equatorial colours. Got in and the place was jumping. The colour scheme is a bit of an assault on the eyes after trudging through the longest rain season in London. Lass at the front takes us to a tiny corner table that had a serious equilibrium issue and one of the legs of the chair I was sitting on was about to give way. As I perched on the corner of the chair, I mentioned it to the fellow who came over first and he rushed away to grab an alternate. So sitting on a much more stable platform, we ordered. Peter, my fellow traveller, ordered the slow cooked beef hash and rice. I was put off by the word hash. I have had some bad experiences with hash in the past, so I ordered the steak. A couple Czech beers later and we were settled in and enjoying looking at the busy restaurant. Food came within 15 minutes and immediately regretted my decision. The steak was great with a really nice salsa verde and a spinach salad, but the \"hash\" looked like classic Barbacoa. Slow cooked beef and then pulled into tasty meaty pieces. It was 5 quid cheaper than the steak and I would say worth twice the price in terms of taste. I would definitely get this the next time here, Lots of options in this area for food but I would say that Cubana is a decent place to go.",

The chicken was deliciously stewed and tender (and a healthy size!), the rice was perfectly cooked, the salad was delicious and the cocktails were wonderful.The atmosphere is intimate with the actual space being a nice size, loved the bright colours and murals and the Latin vibe was a wonderful get away from dreary London outside.

It's impossible for me to have a bad time in this place...Of course, there is more to it than the paint job. I love cocktails, but I like them simple and strong. Cubana pulls it off with a pure, clean, mojito made with nothing but sugar, mint, and a wine glass of rum. Proper Cuban style. There's also a happy hour, which does indeed make me happy.Granted, the sugar will someday give me heart failure, but I'm ready for it. I'll take one for the team. I'll spend my remaining days drinking good cocktails with a big smile on my face.The food is good but I'd suggest this as a venue for large groups rather than intimate occasions. The menu is made up of sharing platters and Cuban style tapas, best served with a small lounge in the back, crammed full of good friends and enough mojito to drown a bear cub.Yes that's right.. I would drown a bear cub for these drinks.",

As I walked, ok, staggered towards it, I could hear the loud hum of salsa going strong. There were almost as many people outside as in (the smoking ban had just come in), and I happily paid my \u00a35 to get in. Inside was some kind of wild party with a salsa band playing, people throwing themselves around, everyone having a good time. Someone got me a Cuba Libra and a Mojito, both of which tasted fabulous.What I liked about this place was it felt authentic, not like some other Cuban bars in London which can feel a little contrived. Its also open quite late on a weekend, till 3am, so its a great place to end your evening.",

The sweet potato and chorizo croquettes were definitely the best of the trio. I had the slow roasted pork as my main. This was very good. The plantains were particularly done well.We didn't stay for the dancing but the vibe seems really fabulous. \u00a0I'll have to try it in the future.",

    "text": "We were looking forward to a fun night of dinner and live Latin American music. We got it, but it wasn't quite what we were hoping for. We made the latest possible dinner reservation, 9:30, hoping we would be well positioned to have a table to chill at once the live music started up. Unfortunately, we were only hurried through our meal faster, as they stack up all the tables and chairs to transition to club mode. That's right, once it is club time, don't expect to sit down for the rest of the night. There are not even any barstools, which is ridiculous when you consider people are dancing and might want to sit and rest a quick minute. Anyway, the food. I had the ropa vieja, which was a little bland. My wife had the slow-roasted pork and loved it. We ordered within minutes of sitting and had our food possibly less than 5, but not more than 10 minutes later. Service so fast it feels like the food has been sitting around all day waiting to be ordered. Uncomfortably fast. I didn't feel as though my meal was cooked for me in response to my order. The server was friendly, but the speed of the service prohibited enjoyment of the restaurant. And that's coming from an American, where you know we love our food fast! Perhaps my wife and I have grown to appreciate the European-style restaurant experience during our two years living in England, but I think it was a bit impersonal even by American standards. Then there was the \"live music.\" It was live in that there were people being paid to be there, but it was more like glorified karaoke. A woman in control of an iPad would select a song, and then her counterparts with bongos would beat along with the background music and sing. I was hoping for a Latin salsa band, but instead we got a chick with an iPad. Still, the experience was a fun night out, so I can't knock it too much, I'm just not sure we will go back.",

Meeting a friend by Waterloo she had never been here so what a great opportunity so close to the station.We only had cocktails here, but if you came at 6ish when we did you could definitely score a table for food. And the menu looked pretty good at a glance. Fusion of the Latina vibe with some Cuban influence (apparently). I reserve the right to review this when I actually do eat here.We knew we were onto a good thing when we turned up to happy hour (5pm - 7pm) and with free tables for bar drinkers only. We grabbed a cheeky table down some steps amidst the vibrant coloured walls and stocked up on cocktails before the deal ran out. Mojitos, not good. Strawberry daiquiri, much better. The problem is how can you really complain at 2 for \u00a36??However after the deals were over we treated ourselves to full price caipirinha (\u00a36.50) and this was WELL worth the money! Now this is my favourite cocktail so if I approve it is worth approving ;) great texture in the muddled sugar and good flavour balance. Tempted to try food next time, make a light of it",

They have outside seating and the staff have got a specific licence, so really hate you walking outside there designated zones - however they should consider what that means as they service too many people and there is nowhere else to go.It high concept, good happy hour, nice food - i'd call it a bar with food -",

Really nice mojitos (as everyone has mentioned) and for being in central London, prices were really reasonable. \u00a35.50 for a mojito (\u00a316 for the pitcher) and under \u00a34 for a pint. Bargain. They are big into fresh fruit (not frozen stuff) and I respect that!Omni Monkey and I both had the (vegan) Cubana Vegetarian Plate and that included: \"Cuban black beans, Falafel Cubana, plantain/chilli rice and sweet potato + plantain crisps\" and at \u00a37?! YES PLEASE.Holy crap, the falafels were out of this world! \u00a0\"(P)repared with garbanzo beans, sweet potato, plantain, cilantro and spices\" I couldn't get enough! Dense and delicious! Especially covered in the black beans.... drooolllllI saw there are lunch specials and happy hour drinks, and we enjoyed it so much we have already made a date to come back to try all those specials when it is not a bustling Saturday night.BONUS POINTS!!!! If you go to the website, there is a section on what is vegetarian and vegan on the menu. AND they have a whole allergy section as well for seeds, gluten, eggs, milk, etc and which dishes they are in. Great place to come if you have a group of mixed diets! Or if you just want to pig out on affordable Cuban food!",

    "text": "Cubana is maybe not the most polished of restaurants, but what it lacks in refinement it certainly makes up for in character. PROSThe food is authentic & deliciously packed with flavour. It's also a bonus that it's also relatively healthy for those of us who are trying to keep control of our waistline. Less healthy but no less enjoyable are the cocktails - and you'll struggle to find a fun, lively but relaxed place to sip the night away in central London. They also do some really fresh smoothies & non-alcoholic cocktails. It's located just a 5 minute walk away from Waterloo station (15 mins if you've had a few too many cocktails) & is well priced with the typical bill for drinks, starters & mains landing in the \u00a360-70 range per couple. CONSIt can be busy, particularly during the week during & just after their happy hour (5pm-7pm)Side dishes are usually served with your starters (?) so make sure you clearly say which meal you want your sides with.For a place that claims to be the \"home of the mojito\" they are inconsistent & occasionally lacking in sufficient rum. The customer is not always right, hence the 2-stars. Twice now we have ordered & been billed for one thing but received something else. On the latest occasion the waitress insisted that our plate of fried plantain was in fact rice, chilli with plantain (despite there not being any rice or chilli anywhere in sight). Presuming your customers are stupid is never the right choice & is a great shame as it really detracts from what is otherwise a fantastic place in the city.",

They also have all sorts of deals through lunchtime. That being said and topped with the high quality of the food itself adds up for a brilliant choice for a lunch spot.

I was so hopeful and ready for some delicious cuban eats but I was greeted with less than mediocre food and a strange ambiance. The yuka fries were dry, the falafel shouldn't even be on the menu and don't even get me STARTED about the salsa and plantain chips. I've had better food served to me out of the back of a sketchy van parked next to the beach which ended up giving me food poisoning. At least it tasted good! The staff was incompetent and slow (We waited so long for our food). The only reasons I gave this place 2 stars instead of 1 is: a. I had a nice time due to the copious amounts of tequila b. I didn't end up with food poisoning (but it was a close call). It's safe to say I won't be back and to be honest, I am very disappointed with the online community for leading me to this place. This is NOT good cuban food and I could honestly make better food myself. To the people who thought this place had good food- please contact me and I will show you what actual good food tastes like. Do yourself a favour and don't waste your time and money.",

    "text": "Ugh, everything here was so good that I struggled not to go back, as I wanted to try as many different restaurants in London as possible. I just love Cuban food, in general (see my previous reviews) so it wasn't too hard to find this place simply delicious! I had the slow roasted pork plate with rice, black beans, and fried plantains. I'm salivating right now just reminiscing on it. Also had the pi\u00f1a colada, which was perfect! Not too sweet and decently strong! The only reason I knocked a star off is due to the long periods of waiting to have our order taken, receive our drinks/food, and receive our bill. They clearly were very understaffed with servers, so that dampened the experience a bit. Otherwise, you can't beat the atmosphere, good vibes, and music there!",

I didn't get the name of every wonderful staff member I interacted with, but from the bar tender who served us our happy hour jugs to our main waiter Juando who made sure we were well taken care of (and didn't laugh at our broken Spanish). The food is really delicious and well done. The drinks were incredible, they aren't so expensive and are very well made (and strong).This is a great happy hour joint, so grab the two for one jugs and laugh at the drunk 18 year olds. Grabbing food after is a great treat. Look forward to coming back to this gem.",

    "text": "In the area for Alice's Adventures Underground at Waterloo Vaults, we were looking for a quick drink to pass some time. It being a sunny Friday in the early evening, Cubana was absolutely heaving outside! Needless to say, we couldn't get a seat on the 'terrace' area, so headed inside to the bar and to scope out a seat. Unfortunately the majority of seating was reserved for eating, but someone directed us to a small drinking area behind the bar. This was not unlike sitting in someone's living room, with a few leather couches and posters dotted around the walls. We both had a margarita, quickly shaken up by the bartender, and at \u00a36.50 for two (hello, happy hour!) this isn't to be sniffed at - especially when considering usual London prices! The drinks were tasty, with a real sour kick, balanced out with the salt rim.We had to leave due to heading to the theatre and, although considering popping back in on the way to the tube, it was even busier. Good to know about if you're in the area, but wouldn't make it a sole destination.",

From the outside, you can spot Cubana from afar considering the thought they put in their decoration. It's lovely, it's colorful, and it makes you want to come inside. I've been wanting to try it out for a while considering I live nearby and walk up to Waterloo station all the time but it's often very busy. Not surprising that it's so busy when you see their happy hour offer on the cocktails (2 for one) and their dishes. I guess it's classic Cuban food, not that I know anything about it, and it was good.Service was helpful and fast.And they had live music !",

In the dead of winter, Cubana brought in so much warmth!! We struggled to get a table. But the boys worked their charm and got us seated.Between the four of us, I think we tried everything on the cocktail list! I loved my caiprinhas. Food is good...but frankly, I wouldn't give it much importance. The music and ambiance were my priority.They open the dance floor after 10. Beautiful music and mood. The atmosphere takes over everything....all else will seem fantastic automatically. Would love to go here again and again and again...anytime I am in the vicinity...actually, only if it's evening.",
