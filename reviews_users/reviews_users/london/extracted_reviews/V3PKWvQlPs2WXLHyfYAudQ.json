I already made the place out via the internet from Germany and specifically went there one evening.Nice area for nightlife around it.Two stories, ground floor and cellar. I got a table in the cellar, where it was a bit crowded but the atmosphere was nice. While I waited for my order I was served a pot of jasmine tea and some japanese crisps. Nice gesture.Sushi was quite tasty and the price was alright.The restaurant made the decision, that they do not serve tuna due to the catching conditions. They state that nice sushi is also possible without tuna. They shall be assuered. Respect for that. Next time in London, next time at Tokyo Diner!",

This makes it a great place to go for a light bite to eat in case you are totally past the reasonable dinner-time due to a late movie or show. Contrary to expectation, they hold a different view to service and its value. The menu lists the inclusive prices for each item, with service charge as well. They don't accept tips either. The service is excellent - they serve green tea and rice crackers as soon as you arrive, and keep refilling your cup through the evening for free. I love the hospitable efficiency at this Japanese diner. There are some good value Sushi sets at 6 pounds and more. There is a large variety of starters and some soups as well. I would strongly recommend visiting this place if you love sushi, and if you don't, well you just might start to.",

We were also very lucky because we got seated right away, but immediately after us (around 7.30) people started to line up.Tokyo Diner is all about one thing: great standard Japanese food. The setting of the restaurant is very basic and small (don't dress up for this). All staff is Japanese and very friendly & humble. They refuse any tips because \"it's not part of the Japanese culture\" (their words). They don't sell Tuna because they believe in only serving sustainable food. As much as I love tuna, I can only truly admire this choice and position they take.The food was really good. We didn't eat as much as we normally do at a Japanese place but had a fair amount of salmon sushi (really fresh), pork with curry (tasted like other ones I had before) and Udon noodles (almost the most recommendable dish of the menu! Only \u00a38 for the noodles with chicken and better than any other trendy Udon place I've been to in Soho).Overall, all the prices are VERY reasonable (almost cheap) for such quality! It's about \u00a32-3 for a beer for example. And the total bill (and in the end, we were full) was only \u00a350 for several beers, glasses of wine, fresh sushi, pork, udon ... I definitely go back when I'm around in Chinatown!",

This is a very down to earth diner. The food is well prepared and delicious. You can get Bento, noodles, sushi, and your standard Japanese starter dishes here. My friend and I ordered a sashimi plate and Agedashi tofu to start. At first we thought 10 pound for a plate of sashimi wasn't a bad price, but when we saw the 7 small pieces of sashimi, we realized it wasn't the deal of the century. The Agedashi tofu was really good. I had the Katzu don which I liked. It was different from the Katzu I am used to, in this version, Katzu was cooked first and then cooked with eggs to form a pancake that covered the rice in the bowl. It was very yummy and very filling as well. What I like about this restaurant is the attention to details. You will find the most comprehensive menu here with information about gluten and nuts/seeds content for each and every one of their dishes. They also clearly stated on their menu that they don't accept tips! Overall, a good place for a quick meal.",

I was hoping they would have more options on the menu. I know this is probably a silly thing to say considering how extensive their menu already is, but I was really expecting an izakaya style place and this was not it at all! And if it is, it is a very limited menu for an izakaya.3. The food was just filling enough.4. Despite the Japanese speaking servers, I still felt this place didnt feel Japanese enough, it feels like I'm in Chinatown...probably because it is in Chinatown =PIn the end, maybe my expectations were just too high before I came, or I just have my own idea of what good/inexpensive japanese dining should be like. \u00a0It's a good fill your stomach on a decent variety of food, but nothing about it deserves special attention.",

    "text": "Absolutely one of the best Japanese homemade food in London. I tried several other places this week because I really miss authentic Japanese food. Unfortunately many of them are not good enough. Food here is more fresh and authentic. Love their side dishes so I order bento very time. Worthy. Service is good today. One girl was very nice. But the cashier lady was distracted. Of course they should operate a no tip policy because there was no service at all( unless you consider ordering food is a service)Btw last month I also had a really bad experience with the old lady in the cashier desk. So arrogant. Never met such an Japanese in Japan. But well I love the food here so until I find some better options I still will come",

They donate all their tips to charity, and they give you more rice if you ask for it.The people in the Tokyo Diner are nice people.It also helps that their food is also pretty good. It's not going to change the world, but it's well-prepared, honestly priced and arrives as soon as it's ready. This can cause some social complications if someone in a group orders a quickly prepared dish (something like the aubergine - something I strongly recommend - which is served cold), though. The lunch deals are all very good value and come with a selection of pickles, miso soup and a side dish that varies day to day. Everyone also gets free tea (and refills!) and some rice crackers to munch while they wait.The only slight downside is that there's no tempura on the menu, which struck me a bit strange for a place focused on bento-style meals, but it's not exactly the end of the world. \u00a0On balance, it's one of the better 'authentic' Japanese places around here.",

They all look similars and you wonder if the quality is everywhere good not to be disapointed and unfortunately it's not ! That's why I definitely recommand to go to this address. It has good prices, ethical concept (they don't use tuna because it's a specie in danger even it's cultural for Japanese to normally eat it) they don't take tip and ask instead to come back and bring friend ! Love the concept :-)Inside the decoration is classic, wood table and some Japanese flag as decoration. You have lunch menu or a la carte suggestion. You can go for hot meal such as soup or fried meat or fish but also some sushi and cold sashimi. I've been a couple of time and never been disapointed. The service is efficient, polite and friendly even quite shy as it's common in asian culture. Might be busy but worth make a try and even try a bit if the queue is not too long. If this one is full, then walk around and catch one with as much as stickers as possible from all the guides and travels books that have rated the place, the best way to find something else !",

From the side way sliding doors, natural wood interior and Japanese waitresses all waiting to take your order, you'll feel like you've just arrived in Japan. I've been here several times because the place is non-complicated. The menus have everything you'd expect from a sushi restaurant with ramen and great bento box dishes to enjoy. I usually come here for the lunch time bento box and I find them very filling. I recommend this place to my friends and to you as it is a hassle-free Japanese zone. However, it does get busy during the evenings so coming during the day when the sun is out is probably best. Lots of Japanese calligraphy on the wall and a good view of what's happening downstairs in Newport place. It is a good place to have a conversation with your friends and there are also pegs on the walls for people to hook their jackets and bags for extra security. The price ranges from \u00a37, which is good enough for such a lively and peaceful atmosphere. I found that the sunny days in the upstairs area were the best days to come here. This is a good place for couples, yet you might have to book in advance if you'd like to bring a group of four. The Tokyo diner is not large enough for big parties unfortunately.; (",

The staff were very friendly, and I like how, if you're especially famished, you can ask for an Omari portion which is larger but free serving of rice. Mmmm.As it stands, I was particularly hungry and got myself Omari with a Katsu which was dreamy. Tokyo Diner's authentic no-tips policy took me back to the land of the rising sun, and I shall be defo coming back here, as soon as I can.The maps of Japan have also had a knock-on effect of making me wanting to travel again, so at least I have something else to daydream about for a few days :)Price wise, \u00a310 for a meal which isn't bad for the centre of town.",

I felt this was helpful to avoid embarrassment or avoid any insulting behaviour. I ordered the Nigiri set which was plenty for lunch along with edamame and miso soup. The fish was very fresh and presented wonderfully. There was just something about the restaurant I really admired. It was quiet, many diners ate on their own and they were comfortable doing so. The price was extremely affordable, the restaurant very clean and the service I found helpful.",

I'm not Japanese, but growing up in Taiwan there was no shortage of good, cheap Japanese food, and I guess this place is the closest to that standard I could find in my short stay in London, with somewhat reasonable prices.Their katsu curry is my favorite. Crispy fried pork chops in hearty curry - what more can I ask for, really. As for appetizers, I often get the chicken karaage - it's just simple, no-frills Japanese fried chicken. Yum. The free tea and rice crackers give it an even more authentic feel, and the staff was always nice to me.Unfortunately they do not do takeout (apart from sushi, if I remember correctly) - hopefully that might change? At any rate, a nice place for ordinary Japanese fare, nothing fancy.",

I've been past the place a few times and never considered it since I thought it looked a bit \"gimmick-y\", but if the Yelpers say it's good...... And as usual, Yelp did not dissapoint. It was really good!The prices are what you would usually expect. And even though the place is a bit \"cliche\", it does feel very authentic.The food was nothing super special, it was plain, simple tasty Japanese food, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would also recommend it for if you have some similar cravings when in China Town :)(Man, I totally have cravings from writing this article already!)",

The food is definitely authentic. Their food is kind of comfort food that would be served in a canteen. (For the third time. I won't say that again.) Their food is decent but not special. To use proper foodie terminologies, they are \"hmm yummy\" but not quite \"OMFG! You gotta try this sXXX. This is f-ing AWESOME!\".  The restaurant is very small and it's right at the heart of China Town so it gets packed. I have never been impressed by their staff, though. Most of the time they are rather blunt. I thought all Japanese people were nice and polite. In one of my recent visits, I overheard two waitresses chatting quite loudly at the back (in Japanese) for quite a long time. Maybe it wasn't the busiest time of all but it doesn't feel right. But they can get away with it. They are at a prime location with high visibility. The food is decent. So there is enough influx of tourists (they are one-off transactions) and locals who need a quick and filling meal. I will still go back for the high cost performance. I only care about food.",

Japanese home cooking, I suppose! Waits can get long in the evening, but they seem to move everyone in and out very fast. The waitresses are very nice--but no tipping!

    "text": "A simple no fuss Japanese restaurant. \u00a0There is nothing \u00a0I could fault about the food in this place. I couldn't give it 5 stars because it was just simple Japanese comfort food, nothing out of ex-ordinary and all the usual Japanese dishes I could get in any other Japanese restaurant. Tokyo Diner focuses really mainly on one plate dishes like donburi and also their famous big portion bento boxes. There are also sushi platters but it just does not have a large a la carte menu. It's a place for a quick fulfilling dinner if you don't fancy Chinese in China town. I do love it's concept of 'No Tipping'. With its free tea, Japanese crackers and no service charge it felt like a Japanese Wong Kei's with better service and better food. Portions were just as big though with free refills of rice for those extra hungry ones. Awesome.We started with starters of agedashi tofu, spinach goma, miso soup and pickles. The tofu was average, not the most silky I've had but still very satisfying in a very well made dashi sauce. Spinach goma stood out the most although I wish they let it warm up a bit rather than it come out straight out the fridge, Still I love the nutty sesame sauce that made this dish so moorish. It tasted just like peanut butter but sweetened and gave the dish a slight sticky texture. It no longer felt healthy but indulgent instead. Wasn't a fan of the plum pickle that was too sour but the rest was fine.My main of pork katsu was massive with a lovely marinated leaf salad on the side. It was one of the better ones I've had with next chunky soft carrots and potatoes in the curry which was perfectly seasoned and flavoured, not too sweet or salty. The katsu was perfectly fried, a nice crunchy batter into a thick succulent tender piece of pork. Rice was fluffy and cooked perfectly. A good choice.However weirdly enough I preferred my boyfriend's tamago don. Something so simple like on egg on rice was so good and comforting. Where my katsu curry cooled down very quickly my boyfriend's dish remained hot throughout due to the egg acting like a blanket. It was soft, mouthmetling and cooked in a dashi stock that wrapped it in a nice savoury flavour. Together with the al dente sticky rice it was just the perfect combination. We also shared a zaru soba which was faultless again. A nice portion, noodles cooked as they should and sauce flavoured well. The most disappointed part was our cold sake which tasted like they had watered it down. Still it did not effect our overall opinion of the place as we were very satisfied with meal. I do love this place and will probably return very soon. The automatic push button door was a nice touch as it made my boyfriend feel nostalgic about his holiday memories in Japan as apparently those doors were common over there. Also that and the light wooden tables, Japanese staff, a large map of Japan and the rest of the decor. With that in mind and the cheap generous prices do prepare to queue or get there a bit early.",

The chicken itself was pretty tasty but not amazing. I would have priced it at \u00a34.50. Also since this doesn't come with rice I had to order it separate. The miso soup was a bit bland, I've had better. My husband had the katsu curry and said that both the curry and the katsu were very bland. The included salad was not the best.

And in chinatown - every dumpling you eat is like a lucky dip- you don't know what meats they have. I would usually head for proper ramen in either bone daddies or tenten but due to not being able to walk very far 4 days after surgery, and i NEEDED to get a haircut because damn, i need to feel pampered after having such a shit time with my medical problems, I decided to treat my cousin here. (he chaperoned me so I didn't get bashed about in london, our family is close knit like that!)It's basic- you get some set lunches, where you would get pickles, rice, what you ordered and soup and I love thats how simple it is, it's the epitome of japanese clean eating so you don't feel so msg-fied afterwards.

They also admitted there may be a language barrier with the server so in case of special requests to make sure the server understood.The food came quickly and it was clearly very fresh- the rice was perfect and the fish was flavoursome and of a decent thickness. I could have done with more ginger but I'm sure they would have provided if I'd asked.Despite it being reasonably busy they didn't rush us off our table after we finished the food but continued chatting, even pouring more tea for us.Polite, efficient, good value.

From the teriyaki chicken tits to the assorted marinated veggies - ehh. Really fresh sashimi though. Good presentation but probably will venture off to try another place for Japanese bento. Side note - if you bring in bubble tea from another place, you cannot consume it in the restaurant.

Every piece had wasabi lovingly nestled between the sashimi and the rice, which made for a savory and authentic taste. Unlike some other Japanese restaurants in the area, the portion of rice was not overwhelming compared to the size of the sashimi, resulting in a far more balanced flavour.Another pleasant surprise was their eco-consciousness. All their fish is environmentally sourced, as is their electricity!Tip: they don't take tips. Which is why we're writing this review, because the least we could do is spread the word about their amazing food and warm service!",

One great thing here is that you can get a bonus on rice if you ask for them with any donburi or curry rice. But there is something less to be desired about the owners' attitude toward their customers. I tried to be friendly and speak Japanese with them, but they were extremely protective and replied in English sternly. Service level could be improved to make this store a better experience to be honest. But at least people will not be disappointed with the food! This place can also get quite crowded during weekends due to being a relatively small place.",

I also read on the menu that you can get an extra-large portion of rice at no additional cost. I really enjoyed my food. It has been a while that I just had a katsu curry without anything fancy or the chef hyping it up. Good tasting and fresh :) It reminds me of what a katsu curry originally taste like.The place is nicely decorated to look traditionally Japanese, so very simple. They do try to maximize the space as much as possible, so I felt like I was having lunch with the people sitting at the next table. Perhaps this is part of the appeal. If I am hungry in Chinatown and unsure of where to go for a sure-thing good tasting meal, I would certainly return. However, I would not travel just to eat here.",

I've been here twice and have tried the udon noodles and their salmon teriyaki set lunch. The shop itself is small and cosy. The staff is courteous but no-nonsense. Table turnaround happens quickly here and they are unapologetic for it. That being said, the staff is extremely accommodating to diners and offers a great deal of information about their food and the customs associated with a Japanese meal (no tipping, free tea, free extra portions of rice) on their menu. Another thing I love about this place is their extensive lunch menu (so cheap) and the further discounts they offer--if you rock up between 3-6pm (their least busy hours) they offer a \u00a31 discount off of their already affordable fare. When planning a meal in Chinatown it can be difficult to be decisive--as delicious food surrounds you from all angles--but the next time you're faced with a moment of indecision, I urge you to check this place out.",

I think we both also appreciate its simplicity, with basic wooden furnishings and straight-to-the-point staff, which I guess lends it authenticity. There's also something endearing about its no-tips policy which I'm told is the norm in Japan.It's a menu of no-frills Japanese dishes and I usually go for one of the donburi bowls which I find quite filling (and the boy usually finishes mine too). He's quite fond of the chicken katsu curry too, and we usually pair it with mugs of hot green tea. The food is nothing particularly creative then but executed well.It's not the cheapest at c\u00a39-10 a main but very reasonable for the area, and with the added perks of speedy service and a haven from the crowds (esp if you sit in the quiet basement area). Recommended if you're craving an asian food hit in the area - I know we'll be back!",

We ordered Katsu don and the spinach with sesame seeds. I have to say that this was the best katsu don that I have had in a long time. And it was wonderful to be served Japanese tea and for it to be refilled constantly throughout the meal. This meal was thoroughly enjoyable!",

Drinks wise: the plum wine's delicious, but very strong and sweet and the Asahi beer is fantastic, but it's a bit dry, so take that into account.As for the actual food: we had a Bento box, which was larger than it seemed from the pictures, the salmon which has absolutely delicious, the rice tofu which also served as a great starter and a salmon sushi set with two nigiri which hit the spot. The waiter was terrific, very nice and prompt with fast service. I can confirm that you get free green tea with refills and snacks, and absolutely no tips. Great Japanese vibe to the place as well, feels like a corner of the country right there near Leicester Square. Absolutely delighted with the experience. We came out full and satisfied and what we paid was more than fair!",

The zaru udon was average. The chicken karaage looked really ugly but ended up being moist and tasty. It is higher than my standard of normal pricing for Japanese food, but for the area seems average. Seating is limited but there is a downstairs section if you're not picky about being able to see out a window.",

Definitely check the place out and try their food, but don't expect anything gourmet.Service: This place has absolutely amazing service and I love their tipping policy. They were extremely fast with taking out order and were always available to help us out. Our tea was never empty because the waiter always refilled it for us when it got low. As for their tipping policy, the waiters don't actually accept tip. Rather, all tips go to a local homeless charity. To me, I think that's a really nice gesture for the restaurant to its community.",

It's the fun looking Japanese restaurant in the middle of Chinatown, and to be fair, you've probably been walking to a Chinese restaurant when you have actually gone past it, so fair enough if you haven't been in. Stop! Go in. Eat. Enjoy. Tokyo Diner offers some truly authentic Japanese food, with great service and atmosphere. The dishes on offer are exactly like what I saw on offer while I was going through Japan, and it was great to see such traditional dishes like cold noodle dishes or the simple tofu side dish with spring onions and ginger. \u00a0It's not exactly the cheapest restaurant, both in Chinatown or for Japanese food in London, but when you consider there's no tip asked for, green tea is included and the food is great tasting (plus you can order extra rice for free), there's not much you can really complain about!4 stars overall for great service, great food, but not the best nor cheapest!",

It was plain, but lovely and fresh and i ate the whole thing up. I also had the veggie maki, which was six pieces of sushi with cucumber and six with Japanese radish. Yummy and veryyyyy filling. The prices here are quite random. Veggie dishes are generally cheap, but meat ranges from reasonable to pretty pricey. One of the many benefits of eating vegan =pThis place is interesting as a business as they are focused on using sustainable produce and give lots of information about their principles on the menu, which I thought was really cool.

I wasn't sure if the waiter was going to put some extra unwanted ingredients on my food from pissing him off at the giddy up, but It wouldn't be the first time. The unagi was tiny and for the price I could have gotten a whole eel in Tokyo. The salmon was decent but skint as well. I'd go back if I happened to be in the area but not going out of my way.

You've maybe never had a meal where your hosts were so attentive to your needs, and in a humble restaurant that appears to pay close attention to the ethics of serving food. They refuse to serve some popular sushi fish because of the unsustainable fishing practices that have depleted their stocks; they provide smaller portions for most dishes with the option to get more for a small price in order to prevent wasting food that people don't finish, and to top it all off the price that they ask for the meal is final and there's no haggling over a tip for the service. It's included.I suppose I should have gotten to the food by now, which is great! Even if you can't have your big eye tuna sashimi, their sushi rolls are tasty and the noodle soups can be quite filling. They also serve beer and sake.Tokyo Diner isn't very big, and it's not exactly a secret as these reviews and the front window, almost entirely obscured by stickers from various London food guides, can attest.

This is a place I often visit on my own, often before meeting friends for afterwork drinks (we all know the dangers of drinking on an empty stomach).",

We have eaten here over a period of at least 10 years and have never been disappointed with the food or the service. The restaurant is on 3 floors, but the service is excellent no matter which floor you are seated in. All of the food is fresh and of excellent quality, and you can have noodle dishes, bento boxes, sushi and loads more! The cost is very reasonable and it's a great place to take friends, especially if you are attending a film in any of the nearby theatres. In proper Japanese-style, they don't allow tipping. This is one restaurant I always recommend to any friends visiting London.",

There's also no tuna on the sushi menu as they refuse to serve any unsustainable fish. This part of town is full of little Japanese restaurants but this is one of the best I've been to - it's not fancy inside but the service is friendly, fish is fresh and it's pretty moderately priced for sushi.",

    "text": "After having to walk across half the city due to student riots (go Tories - radicalize! radicalize!) I decided to stop in here for a quick bite before the long bus ride home. I have been wanting to go here for a while since I saw their vegetarian bento box, advertised as absolutely vegan, and partly intrigued by their marketing strategy of \"no tips - it's just not japanese\" which is prominently displayed on signs throughout the restaurant. Because I was on my own I was shown downstairs, into a somewhat depressing cellar space. Before ordering you can specify that you are extra hungry, and get a larger helping of rice for free (apparently if you do this too late you are out of luck for some reason - why you can't \u00a0get this if you ask later is beyond me. Another nice addition is the free Japanese tea; though I did have to go out of my way to get them to refill (service was only OK and it was one of those places where you can't seem to make eye contact with the wait-staff). The cost of the bento box is not cheap - 10.50 Pounds - but that's probably about standard for this area. The food itself was so-so. The four tiny sushi were just ok, and definitely not fresh. There was very little in the way of wasabi. The rice was OK, and the cooked vegetables tasty, if not stellar. The sesame seaweed salad was excessively oily. The best thing about this place was that it was reasonably filling, and there were no hidden costs; the downside is that the food just wasn't that nice. If you can get a table upstairs the ambiance would certainly be better.",

If your looking for a Sushi restaurant instead of a Japanese food restaurant I suggest you look elsewhere.The second time I went I ordered the Chicken Katsu Bento and it was extremely good. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is the sashimi portion, which consisted of two slivers of low quality salmon.The service is fast and friendly. All food, excepting the sushi, was great quality, well prepared and very tasty. The price is very reasonable for what you get, so although it isn't cheap (or expensive) it is very high value.Not a michelin star \"foody\" destination but a great place to enjoy an efficient, tasty and good value meal.",

The other night, pre-Batman, saw a power cut in this street, but happily there were still tea facilities and an incredibly friendly staff on attendance, easily making up for some dishes being unavailable due to London's dodgy grid. 2 things to know before you go: 1. Tokyo Diner have a sustainable food policy, which means no tuna at present, but the rest of the menu more than compensates, including authentic japanese dishes like Zaru Soba (buckwheat noodles on a bamboo mat, you dip the noodles in the given soy-based sauce then slurp), and delicious agedashi tofu which was pretty much inhaled rather than eaten. 2. No tipping! As they don't tip in Japan, any money mistakenly left on the tables is given to a London homeless charity. This hippy-esque approach only serves to increase my newfound love of the place, I'm so happy to report the food was as good as the philosophy behind it. So, excellent pricing structures, a smile on arrival and a great location will make Tokyo Diner my next pre-cinema dinner choice. Dinner: around \u00a39-15 per person for food and tea.",

Bonuses include complimentary tea, free extra large portions if you want them, and strictly no tipping (which keeps prices even lower in real terms). The food is not extraordinary but there's plenty of seats and it's quick. Lots of people people have a katsu dish of some description because it's reliable, but the bento boxes are also good. One minor gripe: they missed one of the dishes from our group and we had to wait quite a long time for it. But they responded well: since it was so late in the end, we asked not to pay for it.

    "text": "For photos please refer tohungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  Ironically in the middle of Chinatown there is Tokyo Diner, a cheap but decent Japanese restaurant. Even though the owner appears to be English (if you agree with me that Richard Hills does not sound terribly Japanese) the place has a distinct Japanese atmosphere to it. I have just been to Japan couple of months ago and Tokyo Diner feels very much like one of the Izakayas I went to in Kobe. I am talking not only about the furnishing and (as far as I can judge it) Japanese waiters but also the fact that, just like in Japan, tips are not taken, that you pay on the counter when you leave and that green tea (I think it was Hojicha) is served free of charge. The menu is really weird but at the same time rather entertaining: you can spend ages reading the detailed description about every dish as well as some trivia about Japan and Japanese food. In addition the menu contains 5 whole pages with allergy information regarding the nuts/seeds and gluten content for each individual dish. The food only partly lived up to my expectations. I was a bit disappointed actually by the Hoso-MakiI Set (6.20). The rice was too sticky and the salmon didn't taste that fresh. The vegetarian cucumber and pickled radish maki were much better actually but also they did not quite satisfy my palate which has become used to the outstanding quality of sushi in Japan. I love all kinds of Japanese noodles and particularly when I am hungover, as I happened to be at this particular occasion, nothing is comparable to the healing powers of a Japanese noodle soup. I chose the Curry Udon with Chicken (8.20) which was a very decent bowl of soup drenched with the rather mild but strangely addictive flavour of Japanese curry. The udon were not quite Koya quality but really not bad at all. It is not the best Japanese restaurant I have ever been to but considering how cheap, friendly and uncomplicated it is, it is well worth a visit for a quick pre-theatre bite or for a hangover cure.",

As a vegetarian, or even vegan, you're more than welcome and they mark vegan dishes especially. Then there's the free green tea that the friendly staff top up without needing a prod, free large rice portions (ask for an oumori portion), and the refreshing 'no tips' policy, and I'd say it's a winner. Sugoi! (PS: Wouldn't necessarily recommend it for a fancy dining experience, but at the prices offered, it's definitely fantastic value for money)",

I gave some advice, but their tastes (ie meat!) are different to mine so they asked the waitress. Very unhelpful. There was just no sense of 'oh try this' or 'if you like that then this is for you'. It was as if she hated being there and was nervous about anyone saying anything that resembled a question and didn't know what to do when it happened.We ordered edamame to get things started.... which was fine until one of the party found a live maggot crawling over them... ok, so you don't eat the skins, but... just..... no. not for me, thanks. After the earlier 'conversation' with the waitress, we felt at pains to point it out, and we were tired anyway so didn't want to kick up a fuss.The rest of the food was fine. Nothing spectacular but a good cheap option in a great location, just set back from Charing Cross Road, a minute from Leicester Square station.I'd like to go and try it again to see if I caught a new girl on a bad night, but I just don't want any more maggots on my food.",

Tucked away in a corner in Chinatown, Tokyo Diner is an authentic Japanese-run restaurant serving unadulterated and homely staples of modern Japanese cuisine including katsu curries, udon noodles, donburi, sushi and bentos. The menu and dishes are straight forward, but the quality here is far superior to that of the aforementioned chains. You will actually see Japanese people eating here, which is always a good sign, as are the tight crowds during the evening rush. The food quality here is superior to that which I've seen at 99% of the 'Japanese' diners in London though this is in part reflected in the prices. You can get away with spending under 10 pounds but I often find myself going closer to 15. I love the Japanese touches which make the dining experience here particularly welcome and authentic. There is no tipping or automatic service charge, you can request a complimentary large-sized portion of rice if you're extra hungry and the nifty automatic door which is cleverly disguised to look rather old and run down is a nice trick too.",

It's not fair to compare it to Japan, where the ingredients are better quality, but I am glad that a place like this exists, if only because I abhor Wagamama. This is where you can get things like hiya yakko (cold tofu), katsu curry, tsukemono, and una don. Very good value, great hours, and central location.",
