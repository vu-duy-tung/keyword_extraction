This tiny restaurant has an extensive selection of kebabs and other Middle Eastern specialties, and everything we tried was delicious. Our favorite was the mixed grill with lamb and chicken kebabs and lamb kofte served with salad and pita bread. An enormous platter is only \u00a36.75. Their hummus and tabbouli also are excellent.",

    "text": "Taking great pride in using only the highest quality ingredients and freshest produce with no artificial preservatives as well the highest standard of lamb and chicken, this Turkish kebab restaurant has been serving up their succulent savouries since 1974. I can only regret not being around to enjoy all three of those decades of meaty wonder, but since discovering them back in 2001 I've been hooked ever since. And what's been reeling me in all these years is their glorious mixed grill. A mere \u00a35.80 gets a mighty mound of lamb shish, chicken shish, lamb kofte and a doner kebab topping along with a grilled pita and plenty of salad and chilli sauce. The bits of grilled veg are nice 'n' chunky and the salad provides a plentiful bed of lettuce and red cabbage (not to mention some dangerously strong white onions). Even the pitas are a little tastier than those at other kebab joints. And the chilli sauce \u00a0oh the chilli sauce \u00a0well, I reckon it's a good contender for the best in London. All in all, Bosphorus Kebabs' large mixed grill (there's a small version priced at \u00a34.75 and a massive extra large mix for \u00a36.75) is an amazingly satisfying meal that's hard to beat.",

The meat is an example of the random chance, the quality can vary from tasty to food poisoning and you might also have some doubts from which beast it comes from. What I do generally always expect when I order a takeaway kebab is that, whatever the meat, it, along with the usual crew of salad and chilli sauce, will be wrapped up in some kind of bread.that you can walk and eatand try your damndest not to get any down the front of your shirt (this can mean doing a funny walkleaning forward). Here though, I was given my takeaway kebab in a foil takeaway receptacle. The kind you usually get your curry in. As if to complete the curry impression, the separate bread I was given resembled a small naan bread. So where was I supposed to eat the d*mn thing? I set off in search of a park but after finding 4 private parks in a row (all empty on s boiling hot daywhat a wastesilly posh toffs) I ended up having to just try and eat it stood out on the street. I was quite angry. Then I tasted the meatand it was goodbetter than good.could even say succulent? And the rage welling inside me was abated. This was really good food. I guess I should have said eat in. So in the end I am giving it a 2. 4 for the food and 1 for the service.. They could at least have warned me that what they were about to give me was not the norm. I am rounding it down to 2 because of the ridiculousness of serving take out in this way, in an area where its nigh impossible to find a humble bench, on which to sit. Still as the food was goodmy kebab odyssey (qype.co.uk/review/1024002) continues!",

    "text": "At the mention of 'going for a kebab' my inside shrink, having only tried them once in this country. My first (and as a consequence I'd decided last) still appears in my nightmares... fatty, oozing, strips of cheap meat, with heaps of pepper that I can only imagine was added to cancel out the taste of its former self. Whatever that was. When the work boys insisted on taking me to Bosphorus I was ready to think up any excuse as to why I couldn't make it. Ever.It turns out that the food at this little Turkish hot spot is INCREDIBLE. Although I still haven't dared to try the donnor either of the lamb or chicken shish are delicious. Now I'm a complete devote. The meat tastes fresh and is deliciously marinated and the best bit, you can watch it being cooked in front of you on their enormous grill whilst you chew the fat with the friendly Kebabeners (I made that up). They all come in a pitta or in a tray with fluffy white rice and salad. Whichever you go for do not miss their delicious garlic mayonnaise for 60p extra. I love the fact that they're keeping it real by still calling it that when the word 'aioli' has all but eradicated good old garlic mayo.Admittedly, I don't know much about kebab variants, but they seem to offer a great selection, such as Spicy Kofte (the boys favourite) and a great mixed grill. They also claim not to use any dodgy artificial additives so it's probably the healthiest kebab you're going to find after a night out. There's even a good choice of salads such as Kisir, Tabouleh (both bulgar wheat based) and Choban (cucumber, onion, pepper, radishes) so you can even take your veggie friends.The food is undoubtedly great, but the wait is long and service can sometimes be a bit on the brusque side. They seem to like to yelling, \"Hey, lady, what dya want with this?\" at you whilst you stand in the long winding queue of people, which on a Friday night after dancing till 3am can get a little exasperating (are you talking to me or her?!)But, for a kebab this good, I'm prepared to wait in that queue from as long as it takes and damn don't they know it.",

Im always polite, some days they're nice some days they're just plain dickheads. Its enough to not make me want to go back ever again ive reached my limit now.I dont know what their problem is... ive even been waiting in line and seen them be rude or try to pass off smart ass comments to customers. Its like they have a chip on their shoulder or something, they need to get off their high horse and treat their customers with respect to make them feel like they want to go back.Hire some staff who enjoy their job and know a thing or two about customer satisfaction instead of letting their egos get in the way. I dont appreciate it when im a paying, polite and respectful customer and they talk to me and others like were pieces of shit.",

Find somewhere you can eat it and get it everywhere... because it will go everywhere.Not cheap anymore, but the taste speaks of the quality ingredients.

For those who don't know(I didn't either) a \"Doner\" kebab is the meat(usually lamb or chicken) sliced from the spit. Think of it as similar to gyro or shawarma.A \"Shish\" kebab is cubes of meat on a stick, sometimes with vegetables.I've had the Lamb Doner four times and can't imagine ordering something else. They slice the meat very thin, and it is juicy and so flavorful. I could eat a plate of the meat alone all by itself.Combine that with the pita bread they put on the grill and the outstanding red chilli sauce and it is perfection.No \"lamby\" taste that I'd had when I'd tried other lamb from spits.I actually had never liked lamb before Bosphorus!Don't let the hole in the wall look turn you away, Bosphorus is a winner!",

    "text": "In late 2009 I actually died, and a couple of weeks later, I went to heaven. Here, let me show you how: You see that big fluffy white cloud over there with that dude sitting on it with the really long silver beard? That's god that is. You see that magnificent imposing Victorianistic stucco-fronted corner house over there? That was home for a while, that was (not all of it, just a room in it). Now you see that supermarket over there, that contains beer in it? That's Tesco that is. And you see that Kebab house just across the road from it over there? That's Bosphorus Kebabs that is, one of the best kebab houses in the United Kingdom. Welcome to Heaven, I hope you have a pleasant stay.  Yes it is true, in 2009 I died and went to heaven. I was living next to beer and kebabs for about two years solid, and I have the pics to prove it.  Bosphorus Kebabs is more than just a legend, it is a local institution, the holy grail of South Kensington eateries. It's a very small, compact hole in the wall, with an open-plan BBQ/serving stall situated on the right hand side, and a glass cabinet out front, displaying a vast array of various cuts of meats, namely Lamb and Chicken. Inside this rectangular chamber, the decor of the walls is dictated by a hailstorm of posty-cards that have been stuck up linearly, with blutack/sellotape, depicting the memoirs and compliments of previous diners. The national identities of each of these customers is signed off on each postcard, and I don't think there is a major city/country that is not listed on these walls, such is the diversity of all these locations; it makes the United Nations look like an Amish colony. There are a couple of seated tables to choose from, including two which are situated outside, sheltered by canopy and warmed by red-light heaters, and a nifty secluded section tucked away right at the back, should you wish to eat with a little more privacy. It's always warm in there, no matter what the weather is like outside.  Your food is cooked-to-order, and comes with a couple of warmed Pitta-breads, and a combination of salad of your choice (Red Cabbage/Onion/Tomato/Lettuce), and of course, the obligatory Chili sauce (there are a bunch of other sauces as well). Everything is home-made here, and apparently, a whole Hogget (or two) is delivered each day at the crack of dawn, and chopped up by someone down in the kitchen, into the various cuts that you see displayed at the counter. A large proportion of this Hogget goes straight into the mincer, and the resultant squidge is seen revolving around at the front of the stall, in the form of the quintessential Donner.  As far as the other meats are concerned, the choice of Lamb comes in quite a few different guises. There is the standard Lamb Shish cubes, then a couple of variations on this theme including one skewered with vegetables, a spicy version, a Lamb 'burger' (which has some green herb stuffed in the center of it), a Lamb steak, and then the king of the cabinet, the Lamb Saddleback (this one comes with either a bed of basmati rice or pitta bread or both if you like). This is a personal favourite of mine, and it is more expensive than the others. It's delicious. Everything is carved up prior to serving, including the burger, so it's hard to differentiate one version from another after it's been cooked. But this makes for easy stuffing into the warmed pitta breads. Served in tinfoil containers, there inevitably has to be some sort of construction process the second you sit down, to build your kebab, which can be quite tricky slicing the Pitta bread open and butterflying it without fraying the edges.  On the Chicken side of things, they have two small buckets on the counter containing breasts of Chicken and the other one containing the juicier counterparts, thigh sections and the like. Both are soaked in a marinade that has oodles of flavour, and once you get a taste for the Chicken, it's sometimes hard to revert back to the Lamb, simply due to the tastiness of this mouthwatering marinade.  The secret ingredient here, which I was missing during my heavenly time spent at this place, is the simple inclusion of 'table salt' to your meats. I couldn't put my finger on it all that time, but something was 'missing' from my kebabs, and for the life of me I just couldn't figure it out. Salt. They don't add salt to the meats during cooking, so it is up to you to sprinkle some salt onto the end product. It makes all the difference. Remarkably healthy, there is quite a low fat content in all of the meats here, as most of it drains out into the grill, leaving mostly lean tender meat; this, coupled with the salad and plain bread makes for healthy eating; it's certainly not fattening.  Due to it's location, reputation and style, Bosphorus transcends the 'kebab house' status and moves more into the realms of 'meat-house' so-to-speak. It's not your average kebab joint, you know like greasy Donners dripping with fat and soggy salad;",

Since the hotel was in Kensington that was where I started the search. According to Yelp the most popular spot that week was Bosphorus Kebabs serving something called a Doner.Upon further research I found out the \"Doner\" was something akin to a \u00a0shawarma sandwich just with some Turkish influences rather than Greek. I also realized that in comparison to most eating in London it is fairly cheap.So cheap good eats near the hotel. Well let me tell you, this is one place that \u00a0I would go out of way to eat at. The lamb and chicken are tender and juicy, the chili sauce that comes with it is spicy and brings enough heat to make the sweat just start to roll and the back of the throat get that little cough going.The place is a dive in all the best ways. Small and cramp, surly guys working the flattop. I wouldn't change a thing.",

They like calling the boys 'boss' and the girls 'love', even hollering at passing people outside. The choice of sauces and salads are excellent, and you can sit inside or outside on the street. Two unique touches are the fact that you pay at the end of the meal, like a 'proper' restaurant, and the fact that you stuff your pita yourself, receiving a large container of meat and salad, with the bread seperate.But it's all about the meat. All of it is Halal, very well seasoned and cooked to perfection. I like the Lamb and the Large Mixed, but I'm confident that the whole menu is excellent. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Tiny shop. Big flavor.We saw this place on yelp and both of us are kebab fanatics so we had to check it out. This place feels wildly out of character for South Kensington amid all the upscale shops. It's decidedly downscale and almost feels a bit dirty inside, but the tables are (mostly) clean. It is the very definition of a greasy spoon. We had an extra large donner kebab plate and a plate of \"lamburger\". The name is just a pun though, it's not actually a burger. Both dishes are served on a plate with a side of red cabbage, tomatoes, lettuce, and a grilled flatbread.The kebab meat was fairly standard as far as spices and cooking goes. If anything it was a bit on the dry side but it's cheap fast food and too delicious to complain about. On the other hand, the lamburger was a real treat, it was just perfectly tender and juicy. I'm not sure if the disparity has to do with the fact that all the non-kebab meats are just sitting there in the front of the store uncooked and soaking in marinade and cooked to order while the kebab is just shaved off and plated.One more thing, the atmosphere is very laid back. If you are a nervous tourist like we were you may trip over some aspects of ordering or paying. The staff are friendly enough though and will help you out if you ask.PROs:- The non-kebab cooked to order meats- The priceCONs:- VERY small inside",

Basically, you should translate that passage to mean mounds of succulent lamb carved straight off the vertical spit as you watch on with (likely) mouth agape.

I could have phoned room service, but you try ignoring fresh minced lamb doner kebab after the floodgates, err bag, has been opened!What's a girl to do?

The walls are covered in laminated notes in every language that sing its praises from years and years ago. Service was quick and efficient. The donner kebab platter only set me back \u00a36 and the portions were plentiful only wish I could eat the pita that came with it (since I am GF). The meat is tender, salty with a slight caramelised factor thanks to this huge spit. The accompanying red cabbage flavourful while the lettuce and tomato fresh and a good counterbalance to the meat. Hummus was pretty good too! Overall if you don't care about atmosphere and food is everything, you've found yourself a winner! I have to go back and try some of the grilled meat selection in the display case at the front soon!",

Or, you know, you could read the reviews and look at the pictures. Since, evidently, I couldn't be bothered to do either, I was slightly surprised at what I received. That said, what I received was good. I went with the standard favorite, the doner kebab. As with what i usually find at similar shops, I had no where near enough pita to enjoy with the meat but the few(ish) bites of meat/bread combo I experienced, I enjoyed. Salad's salad. I appreciate the effort but I would have gladly traded the green for some additional pita. As I mentioned above, the meat was good. It was a bit too salty for my liking, hence a three-star as opposed to a four. I also had a bit of diner's envy when I saw another patron order the spicy kofte. From looks and aroma, I think I should have gone with that selection. Be also advised: this place is tiny. While you may be so famished that you have no choice other than to sit and eat, a more enjoyable experience may be to pick up and take away. You pay after you eat. I don't know why, but I rather enjoyed that. I think there's a modicum of greater respect in such a transaction.",

    "text": "Fantastic place nearby the South Kensington tube station. It's a hole in the wall with not much place to sit, so we took our food to go. Everything on the menu is very reasonably priced. I think the most expensive thing was \u00a310. For a family of 5, we got 2 XL mixed grills and 2 Chicken Kebab's (one chicken breast and one chicken thigh skewer). In terms of quality, I've never had a more tender and delicious selection of kebabs to choose from. We had chicken, beef and lamb and they were all marinated and cooked to perfection. Would highly recommend visiting this place if you're in town and nearby visiting Kensington Palace since it's basically walking distance.",

    "text": "All the reviews left me thinking this is the best kebab shop in London, shit even the world. I don't know what these locals/tourists are smoking.I ordered a medium lamb shish kebab. Service was fine. Now the food...The lamb pieces were a little chewy though had *some* good flavors. A bit lukewarm. They're served with an ok, lukewarm pita bread and a cold, bland bed of purple cabbage, chopped lettuce and tons of raw onions! Why?? No addition sauce was offered except a tomato-chili sauce added in top of meat.I guess for $6 it's a good deal but I wouldn't even pay this to eat here. The reason why I'm leaving a harsh review is due to the pumping up of reputation this place has. I've had better kebabs in Turkey as well as other countries in the world. This place does not deserve to advertise their food in such manner.",
