    "text": "Arang is a Korean Restaurant just off the back of Piccadilly Circus. On first impressions the restaurant is very modern with table tops of white marble and black bottoms. Our first hurdle was choosing from the menu where options were wide and varied. Our waitress, a native Korean, was very helpful on this point and made a number of suggestions in line with customary Korean eating. Our second hurdle was knowing what to do with our food. In prior Korean eating experiences we would have cooked the barbecue ourselves but on this occasion every piece of meat was cooked by our waitress. Good service but I felt it was a touch OTT. We went with Spring Onion & Fried Korean pizza with seafood, Fried squid with vegetables & red pepper paste sauce (very spicy), and for the barbecue dishes Bulkabi (beef rib) and Bulgogi (beef) plus some rice and lettuce. We were also given some complimentary sides including Kim Chi and Potato Salad. Oh we also received complimentary fruit which was a nice end to the meal. Overall I was pleased with the quality of the food and the service was fantastic. I would have perhaps liked to cook the food myself next time as it felt like the waitress was there for the WHOLE meal. Arang is a very popular place and booking is recommended.",

The place is on two levels; the upstairs being reserved for the BBQ and a basement level with a complete lack of style and air in that matter. It was like entering a completely different place so I recommend not going there - just stick with the upstairs BBQ and it would be fine. The food was amazing and cooked in front of our eyes. Keeping in mind that I am a meat lover, I had a great evening. I think that Arang is great minus the dodgy basement area.",

A quick stop in London seemed necessary, if not required. After a 10-hr overnight flight, a stop at LAB for zombies, and wanderings around whoknowswhere, we ran into friends who extended an invitation to us for korean bbq. \"Sure!\"This was my first experience with korean bbq and no one told me to go light on the appetizers. All these great, scrumptous dishes kept flowing out of the kitchen, plus bottles upon bottles of soju, sake, and beer. Holy moly! An hour later when I was happy and satisfied, they busted out the bbq grills and platters of meat! I kept telling my stomach to power through. Maybe the alcohol helped. Anyways, 3 hours later, the feast ended but the night only began. We rolled out of our chairs and downstairs to the private karaoke rooms. At this point, I had been awake for WAY too many hours and probably delusional. I remember yelling and standing on couches. Whatever happened that night, I woke up the next day refreshed, with my internal clock adjusted, and ready to tackle London! Thank you Arang for keeping the food, drinks, and entertainment rolling till the cows came home.",

They even have a wonderful direct extractor fan system so your clothes will never smell of Korean BBQ when you leave. The food is obviously good, as many Koreans come here and there are often queues outside and people sitting waiting to be seated. It's definitely worth booking. I don't know whether they have changed hands recently or not, but we experienced terrible service on our most recent visit. The side dishes were plonked/slammed on to our table, causing some to spill out. Then when they were taking our dishes away, they knocked over a glass of water spilling some on my brother. They then did not help wipe up/provide napkins or a cloth and only half-assed apologised. The final straw was that they just put the bill on the table without us even requesting it. I mean yes you have people waiting but they can wait, we had booked a table!!! So just because YOU want a quick turnaround and more money, don't be rushing your paying customers out of the door. It made me so angry. Needless to say I won't be in a rush to hurry back there again.",

Well, last week as I walked past the delivery guy was unloading everything from his van onto pavement in front of the restaurant.I didn't think anything of it because everything looked boxed and packaged, but then I noticed a huge slab of meat that was only half wrapped in plastic and was sitting on the floor! ON THE DIRTY PAVEMENT!It made me feel sick that they could be serving meat in their restaurant that had touched the same pavement that dirty shoes, dogs, chewing gum, rats, piss and vomit has probably touched too.

    "text": "A friend and I turned up to Arang tonight with no reservation, and were told it would be a 30 minute wait for a table. We decided to stay, which was definitely the right move. The wait ended up being less than quoted, and we were soon shepherded to a nice table complete with gas barbecue (more like a Japanese teppan) in the centre. The service was slick, and we soon had large plates of meat and smaller plates of kimchi, potato salad, beansprouts etc, these being on the house as is customary in Korea. Despite the authenticity of the food and the flavours, we had an attentive (and attractive) waitress who did most of the cooking for us at the table, unlike in Korea/Japan where you'd be left to fend for yourselves. However, this was not an unwelcome variation! The marbled beef was pretty good, and the marinated pork belly bulgogi was excellent, extremely tender and full of flavour. The latter was as good as anything I've had in Korea/Japan, as were the kimchi and other side dishes. Finally we had a spicy beef soup, which was outstanding. Arang has a wide-ranging menu, and I will certainly be back to try out some of the other dishes. The prices are reasonable, particularly considering the quality and the area, and we stuffed ourselves for 20 quid a head including beers and tea. The place was buzzing with a young, good-looking client\u00e8le when we went there, and I'm not surprised at its popularity. Despite this, the service didn't miss a beat. I would make sure to book if I went again, but judging by axisofunity's review, this may or may not make a difference! There seemed to be a fair number of Korean diners too, always a good sign. Highly recommended. Food: 5Service: 5Value: 4 (marked down for cans of coke being 2 quid, which seems an extreme mark-up, although it's probably standard)",

    "text": "Summary: A Korean Restaurant near Picadilly Circus that serves excellent Korean food, including BBQ at the table. Prices are very reasonable and service is good. Review: Arang is situated on Golden Square and has some parking around however it is easy to reach via Tube or walking from Charing Cross of Leicester Square. Arang is comprised of a bar, front-room, back-room that is usually used for private dining and a downstairs private-bar and karoke/club area which can be hired. The owner and most of the waiting staff are Korean and there's always the latest KTV drama theme-tune or music quietly in the background. Arang appears a little 'rough and ready' and is always very busy so booking is essential. However in my experience booking doesn't mean you'll get to sit down at that time, a number of times I have booked and then still had to wait up to 35mins for a table! The manager has bene very kind and given out free drinks but it's still annoying. Never-the-less when it is your turn to sit down the food is excellent and quick to arrive. I really recommend some of the set-menus that include the BBQ. As well as the BBQ (at your table) you also get numerous starters including noodles, seafood, kim-chi and other dishes. I've found that for \u00a320 - \u00a328 per head you will be stuffed :) If set-menu doesn't take your fancy then there are lots of authentic dishes on the menu including Bi Bim Bap cooked in stone dishes. Their current website has a great menu list with some pictures, (arang.co.uk ) and if you have a look there you should get your taste buds going :D I've found that overall the restaurant is great besides from the slightly packed front-room and often delays in seating. If these didn't happen every now and then, then this would get five starts for just being fun with good food. Overall, I have not yet found a better Korean restaurant in London at this price range. Let me know if you try it and your feedback :)",

    "text": "Soho Korean barbecue - and only so-so. \u00a0Arang had good meats (fatty and flavorful beef tongue, pork belly, and ribeye) for their authentic tabletop charcoal grills, but unfortunately, the good news stops there. \u00a0If you're used to Korean BBQ \u00a0anywhere there's a solid Koreatown, you know to expect the banchan to be complimentary and plentiful. \u00a0I mean, that's part of what makes Korean BBQ such a fun experience! \u00a0Arang, however, charges for the banchan (and we had to buy 2 \"orders\" of banchan for the 5 of us; each banchan order comprised of 3 small meager dishes), as well as for the kimchee, the namuls - we even had to pay extra for the lettuce leaves for eating the grilled meat as ssam! \u00a0I can't tell you how dismaying it is to be nickel-and-dimed this way (or would this be \"penced-and-shillinged\" in Britain?) as it really detracted from the pleasure and hospitality of Korean barbecue. \u00a0Other than the barbecue offerings, Arang's other dishes are uneven in quality and taste. \u00a0Their bindaeduk was very thick, un-crispy, as well as un-flavorful, and was made the cheap and easy way with mung bean powder rather than ground fresh mung beans. \u00a0A mixed seafood and vegetable rice dish (haemul-deopbap) was more American Chinese than Korean (and tasted it too - not to diss American Chinese cookery, that is). \u00a0However, a Korean mixed seafood fry (modom-jeon) was quite tasty - and thank goodness it was, as it was one of the priciest items in their menu. \u00a0The service was good, however, attentive and polite, and the waitress working our grill was a delight. \u00a0That kept our collective opinion of Arang at 3 stars rather than 2.",

    "text": "First Korean restaurant I've tried in London. No complaints about the quality of the food except maybe the yukgae jang () which was a bit peppery tasting. The portions, though, were tiny. ~\u00a310 for each serving of meat, each of which came with an avg of 6 pieces!!! We ordered samgyupsal (pork belly), , and \u00a0(don't know these in English). We also got spicy rice cakes () which was also a tiny portion for ~\u00a310.Also not a lot of side dishes came out - the only ones that came with the meal were \u00a0(some kind of sprouts I don't know what it is in English), potato salad type thing, and kimchi. I don't know if this is normal in London, but I'm from California, where portion sizes are huge, quality is unparalleled, and side dishes are unending. We had to order extra rice and lettuce () for the meat.I went with 2 others and the total came out to \u00a360, which isn't unheard of, but I'm fond of my AYCE kbbq joints.",

Turns out, I love Korean food!The staff were very attentive and dealt really well with the escalating rowdiness of our group - there's always one that breaks a glass...We ordered the table top meat grill and plenty of yummy side dishes. The meat grill seemed to go on forever, more and more meats being brought to the grill every couples of minutes. There were plenty of fish dishes to choose from as well. The food was amazing, although, it was a shame about the price as it ended up rather costly.A great place for groups to have. Taste of authenticity.Although the place wasn't very busy at all, do make sure you book ahead if you are going as a big group.",

    "text": "Not much things better to have on a Winter's day than an Asian Soup. There's ramen or pho, but the cravings for a spicy Sundubu-Jjigae all week can only last so long. And that is what I had on a cold January.It's the only way I will ever have Tofu. Loved investigating the depths of that broth to discover all the different creatures of the sea lurking under surface. \u00a0Mussels, fish, shrimp, squid and octopus. Surprisingly quite a lot.I have to say the broth was not as thick as I have previously tasted at rival Korean restaurants. Assa down the road have a fantastic Sundubu-Jjigae, which is a perfect balance of thick, spicy and flavour. This one at Arang is spicy but I think there could be more depth of flavour and intensity.I did like however, something I haven't found much of in Korean London eateries. And that is unlimited free sides. So Kimchi was a staple to get seconds on for sure. It's a nice and in my opinion necessary touch. It's common to give loads of free sides in Korea so glad someone is at least replicating this here.Service is quite good. We sat at the ate which is fine by us even though the door kept opening for new custom and allowing breeze in. People being turned away is good sign of popularity but can't help think that's a London thing. Seems to be the norm to have to wait everywhere is so busy.I'll definitely come back to try some meats and bbq as they had a proper table set up with extractor fan to experience that.",

    "text": "So there's a korean food fair in town, and they were serving kimchi pancakes for 6 dollars apiece, and I just had to try one because it reminded me so much of this place.So where do I begin? London, a cold winter's night, just before The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime. We stumbled in worn and weary after a day of shopping into this warm, cosy haven tucked just off Golden Square. You know that it's a good deal when 90% of the diners in the restaurant are Korean. I felt a little bit of a culture shock, having spent the past 3 weeks being the minority.I must admit that my knowledge of Korean food is zilch- the only korean things I know are korean barbeque and kimchi and instant noodles. My friends, the experts, ordered.So where was I... KIMCHI PANCAKES, yes. If you must order one dish make it THIS ONE because it was so darn awesome. A pancake meant to feed 6 as a side but I WANTED IT ALL. It was thin, crisp, yet flavourful and packed with wonderful compressed kimchi. Good just on its own! (In contrast, the one I had for takeaway today was soggy and limp and nowhere as rich in flavour mehhh)Oh yes and the food is pretty spicy, no holds barred authentic cooking. But seriously. Just go. The kimchi pancakes are worth it.",

    "text": "As a vegetarian, I cannot review the BBQ, which seems good judging by at other reviews, but I WOULD NOT go to this restaurant at all costs if you want to eat something other than meat. Being korean and a regular customer at great Korean restaurants in the NYC and DMV area, I had high expectations for Arang-- and it even seemed that many Koreans were in the restaurant, a usual sign for authentic food.However, I was thoroughly disappointed on all counts: ATMOSPHERE: Upon entering the restaurant, we were told that there were no more seats on the ground floor and we would have to be seated in the basement--which seemed fine. However, the basement seemed like a very dodgy club with dirty, sagging red couches and a \"private\" sign affixed to the door. \u00a0I felt like I was in a strip club dressed up as a restaurant.FOOD: Mediocre at best. The boricha we received on arrival was lukewarm and of a cheap grade; the cups were greasy and smelled of oil. Tap water was also served in a beer shot glass-- a super pet peeve of mine. The side dishes were bland and unappealing--kimchi, bean sprouts, and potato mayonnaise salad. The haemul pajun was a soggy, bland, oily mess with cheap imitation crab counting as the \"haemul\" or seafood; it looked like it had just been reheated and served. The haemul bibimbap was appalling; instead of vegetables and seafood with gochujang on the side it was random segments of unidentifiable seafood smothered in cheap artificial gochujang with just rice. Everything was past its expiration date and just plain bland.PRICE: Expensive and unreasonable prices for the small portions. \u00a0About 9 quid for a small bowl of rice and low-grade seafood?!? are you insane??? And the whole \"rent\" excuse is just not acceptable-- I have dined at asian restaurants near the Piccadilly area which are far more affordable and ten times better than this restaurant. SERVICE: Our waiter could not speak English. We had to ask twice for the boricha and the bill. The place was understaffed and the service was incredibly slow. When we asked the manager if we could get a table upstairs, he told us that we could leave. We should have taken his advice.Needless to say, I would not recommend Arang to anyone. A truly good restaurant should prepare all its menu items with equal quality and attention--Arang has failed at this.",

    "text": "This is actually one of my all time favourite Korean restaurants around the area, the other one being Assa. However, this time my experience is not as good as the experiences in the past few years.I came with Wendy L and we ordered the seafood pancake, glass noodles, 2x Cinnamon punch, 1x spicy seafood noodles, and 1x beef bibimbap (hot stone bowl rice).We were given the usual complimentary starters, which consisted of potatos in salad type cream, kimchi, and green veggie. So far so good.The seafood pancake was also as expected, although it was lacking the seafood, I could barely make out any.The glass noodles tasted a bit bland this time round. It used to be sweeter and same problem again, lack of beef.Cinnamon punch is my favourite drink and it did not disappoint, although it was a bit weird coming in an Asahi beer glass.Spicy seafood noodles was the really really disappointing dish. I have never ordered this before and Wendy L wanted to try it. The broth was slightly spicy, but otherwise tasteless. The seafood was completely overcooked (think really chewy squid, octopus etc). Noodles were average.The beef bibimbap was pretty good except the egg came completely cooked as well...like a sunny side up egg. This should have come raw and been mixed in the rice? I was super confused.Just before paying the bill they gave us two halves of an orange sliced. It was super sour and was actually hurting my teeth due to sensitivity. I noticed the table next to ours seems to have melons as well. Ah well, if the melons were as bad then I was glad they didn't waste it trying to feed this to us.The waitress looked a bit depressed but this could have been because I was ultra depressed at the state of the meal and was also very tired due to lack of sleep. I was particularly disappointed that after finishing the meal and whilst waiting for the bill, these flies kept hovering over my empty bowls and were trying to get into my super sweet tasting cinnamon punch. They were unrelenting to say the least!I think I will give this place a break for now....hopefully it will be back to the amazing place I have known it to be soon.",

Main dishes before appetizers and some food never came. We were extremely disappointed in the service.
