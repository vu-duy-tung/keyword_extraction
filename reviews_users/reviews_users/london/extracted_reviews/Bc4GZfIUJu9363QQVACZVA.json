Now in the colder months I am experiencing the comfort of their cosy interior, which is very trendy indeed.I am docking a single star for the slightly-too-relaxed service, which is fine and pleasant but we are in Exmouth Market, not on holiday in Hawaii after all, which is more the pace the waiters seem to operate at.Simple breakfast items such as eggs on toast make you believe the 2-inch thick cut toast and fluffy-scramble decorated with fresh herbs and pepper was a designed menu item. The warm cakes are good too... am yet to eat a non-brunch/coffee meal here yet but am so far very satisfied.",

Delicious food (I had the baked eggs with chorizo! yum!), and a delicious Bloody Mary to go along with it. Nothing says brunch more than being able to drink while eating breakfast. If you want to read more about the food, check out my previous review of the place, this review is about the coffee!While I was waiting for a table and the rest of my party to show up, I ordered a filter coffee. What I love about Caravan is they have a selection of filter coffee to drink. Most people in the UK seem to go the espresso route when it comes to coffee, but I prefer regular coffee. Not that I dislike espresso, because I do enjoy the occasional one, but I love the variety in roasts and beans that you can get with just a regular coffee. Anyway, the coffee I had was supurb. The taste was amazing. I really can't describe it. I went with a recommendation of the server, and it was a good recommendation indeed.The person sitting at the table next to us ordered some coffee beans to take home. An idea popped into my head. _I_ could do that. Then I felt guilty. I already had coffee at home that I ordered from my usual coffee place. It was sitting there waiting for me. But the dreams of the coffee I had that morning were in my head. I debated to myself. I talked to the people at my table. In the end, I bought some to take home. I asked for the coffee I had that morning, and the server said he was pretty sure he knew which one I would have been recommended.I do wish he would have asked. I did end up with different coffee than I had. It was a bit annoying as the bill clearly stated which one I had, but he just assumed it was the one the servers drink. I just made a pot of it, and it is also quite spectacular, even if it isn't the same. I've cheated on my usual coffee supplier. I feel guilty. So guilty. But yet I feel so good. I think I may be in love with Caravan's coffee.",

The smoked salmon and the blue cheese & peanut wontons are two of my favourites. The But it would be criminal to miss out on the mains. They are particularly skilled at creating interesting and moist fish dishes. But, with all that said, I'm still only giving them 3 starts. Here's why... they make it a bit tough for you to enjoy yourself. They pack the restaurant like they're packing a tin of sardines. We booked well in advance for 9 people, but when we showed up the table looked like it was meant for about 6 people. With only 2 girls in the group, and some very tall guys, it proved to be a struggle. Maybe it's just not a great place for groups.",

You can tell that they use good coffee but unfortunately it wasn't really that well made. It wasn't bad but it wasn't as good as it could have been either, it was a bit bland. The interior is spacious and the place gets packed on weekends it seems. The wait was only 15 min and they let you sit inside to have some coffee or drinks while waiting. Overall the service was excellent, the waitress constantly refilled my water glass and everyone was well friendly. Too bad the food was such a letdown. I ordered the grilled ham with bubble and squeak and poached eggs with hollandaise. Unfortunately I couldn't find any redeeming feature. The ham was way too thick, was dry but still not really grilled. The bubble and squeak was a big lump of really sweet deep fried potato mash, reminding me of my school days. The eggs were overcooked and the sauce had no lemon, only butter in it. The fry up on the other hand didn't look too bad so if I ever happen to be in Caravan again I'll try that instead. Who knows, maybe I had some bad luck with my food?",

Maybe it's difficult to run a place that is as 'trendy' as Caravan without shortcomings when it comes to service? Luckily there are enough other cafes/restaurants within walking distance that serve good food/coffee also.",

So far I've always gotten seated straight away even on a saturday morning at 11 and service is pretty quick. One dish that I would stay away from is the corn bread french toast. If you like corn bread and you like french toast (which I do), this might sound very attractive to you. However, don't be fooled. This is neither good corn bread nor french toast, so don't be fooled.

Its well worth it and I felt the quality and freshness of the food was great. The tomato was full of flavour and \u00a0I particularly liked the grain toast that I tried with my boyfriends Fry up. I thought the side dishes were a little pricey but then I guess that can be expected as side dishes usually are. I had the ham, poached egg and hollandaise sauce for some reason which is highly pecuilar and I generally am not a ham fan by any means. This ham was tasty and not fatty by any stretch of the imagination so much so I had nothing left on my plate. The staff were always coming around topping up your glass with water and would bend over backwards. In some ways I thought they were a little too efficient and I kind of got to the point where I stopped drinking my water just so they would stop coming back to fill it up. I know whats good efficient service these days. We complain when we don't get it and here am I complaining that it was tooo efficient. As we went on a Sunday around 10:30 we just managed to get a table (the place had a constant in and out customer flow) and the real crowds starting coming when we were leaving.

Though my macchiato was sub-par, the food was perfectly tasty. The fire-roasted tomatoes were great on the dish. Things were fresh and good, and the service was fine. Not much else to say. Good spot for breakfast if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",

    "text": "Brunch is one of my favourite meals and this is absolutely one of my favourite brunch destinations.For me, Saturday morning brunch after a well-earned lie-in is the transition I need to unwind from work and settle into the weekend. Therefore I like it to feel as unhurried and long drawn out as possible, something to be celebrated and savoured. This is partly why I like Caravan so much. They don't rush me. Despite being popular and busy it doesn't feel like a production line, getting the punters in, shovelling them full of food and booting them out as quickly as possible to make way for the next wave. I can read my paper in peace and get a good way through it with a pre-meal juice and coffee before my order gets taken and food arrives. And then I can linger pretty much as long as I like with a second or even third coffee (the coffee is extremely good).The menu is interesting and varied, so there are enough choices that you don't have to keep coming back to the same thing every time, and they clearly make an effort to come up with more unusual options rather than just the standard breakfast fare.Notwithstanding the opening of the newer, bigger Kings Cross branch, I still like the Exmouth Market Caravan better. It just feels more friendly and cosseting.",

Okay, okay maybe that is a huge generalisation, because I have no desire to be either and I want a caravan. I just think it would be really useful to have the extra space. A traveling bedroom of sorts. So with this in mind, I should really love Caravan, the bar. There is some logic there I promise!I've been here twice and both times I've left with very little to say about the place. It's had a real bunch of mixed reviews. Apparently the coffee is fabulous, roasted on the premises, but I've only been here for drink. And if the service is anything to go by, I can see why people don't know what to think of it. Really friendly but really slow. Inept, might be a good word to describe it. Which is such a shame as the location and cocktail selection are both really quite pleasant. I will be back though. It's got a certain draw to it. Maybe it's the name... Anyway, I like, I don't love. I may well update this after the next visit. I'll keep you posted.",

Consistently, Caravan was mentioned to me as a must-do, from various sources. Okay, then, I accept the challenge. I love brunch, and had a friend in town who needed to meet the new beau, so we decided to do brunch on a Sunday morning.I had the Caravan Fry-Up, which is basically English Breakfast (eggs, streaky bacon, tomatoes, mushroom and toast) without the blood sausage (good! I ask for it to be removed every time anyway!). It was pretty tasty, though nothing as mind blowing as I've had at other places. My best friend much preferred her brunch here among the places I took her whenever she visited, so I guess it's a trade off. I did notice a distinct lack of chorizo on the menu, which always loses a few points with me. Nothing is ever made worse for including chorizo.Overall, it was a nice experience. We didn't have to wait to be seated, the service was good, and the prices were standard for a central London brunch at a highly reputed place.",

All you need to know is that you have to go there as soon as possible, and you have to order everything on the brunch menu. Just kidding. But go* (right at 10 when it opens, so there are only 8 or so people waiting, rather than a 30 person queue as is usual), try some things (good luck deciding, though), buy a cup of coffee, and you'll have already accomplished a hell of a lot on a weekend morning.*Just a note: you can't make reservations for weekend brunch, so you will wait. The question of how long is entirely up to you (and your alarm clock!).",

If you are expecting to rock-up at midday and expect to get a seat straight way you are going to be disappointed. Even though you can book a table during the week, this place is so popular on the weekends for lunch that it is first come first served.If you do rock-up at midday or even later, they do a pretty good job of queuing people and communicating when they are expecting a free table for you and your friends. They actually give you a bag of coffee beans with a number on that you have to keep and then trade it for the table.The food really is incredible, tasty and great quality.

Corn bread is hard to find in London, let alone as a base for french toast---and Carvan makes it perfectly!The downside---no reservations for brunch which can mean you will wait and wait and wait...so get there early!

I had a filter coffee, no milk or sugar necessary. In fact when my friends tried to order a filter coffee and milk, the waitress encouraged them to get an Americano if they wanted milk.

Same day reservations should work. 70/30 you'll get a seat if you show up without one on the average weekday. (Unless you're with a group.) They're very accommodating. One of my favorite go-to's.",

    "text": "You know those places that you've heard so many positive things about that you just -really- want to love because everyone else loves them? The kind of joint that everyone oozes about when it's brought up. That's Caravan in a nutshell. A local hangout that I desperately want to adore, but can't justify the praise.Perhaps its popularity has engendered a certain arrogance or ennui. It's clear, during weekend brunch-times, that they're certainly not lacking in eager diners, but the way that we were handled from start to finish left a little something to be desired.Even from the moment we walked in, there was a sense of confusion or lack of concern. We weren't even greeted by an employee and had to inquire with a passing server whether or not we could be seated. Then, we were pointed to one of the counter seats across from the bar, so we settled in. Shortly after ordering food and drinks, a different girl came over to ask if we were waiting for a seat in the dining room - we hadn't even been presented that option earlier; we didn't realise we were in 'temporary' seating! Having already gotten ourselves situated, we couldn't be bothered to move. It would have been nice if that had been communicated earlier.As for the food and drink, my bloody mary was acceptable, if not noteworthy. The baked eggs dish with tomato and pepper ragout was worthy of a post-big night brunch. Of course, as a massive fan of chorizo, I couldn't pass up adding those on for a \u00a32 extra charge.Caravan could go a long way toward being a staple Sunday ritual if they just got their act together on the service front. As it is, I'd rather spend my coin at St. Ali instead.",

Definitely stumbled upon it on Yelp and decided to take the plunge. It was a rainy Sunday morning and we needed food. When we showed up, the wait was 40 minutes, but they said we could sit on the partially covered patio in the rain with no way. We sat in the corner braving the drizzle.Even being busy, the service was top notch and we got our order quickly. The avocado toast is a can't miss. The other food was REALLY good - everyone was really happy. The breakfast cocktails were a little expensive around \u00a38, but they were good.Innovative menu, trendy interior. Like it.",

However we'd spotted space outside and when asked were seated there straight away (so why were we asked to wait?!).We ordered a couple of juices which were exactly what you'd expect and reasonably priced at \u00a33 and \u00a34.50. We then had the aubergine with sausage and the baked eggs. The aubergine dip was delicious however we couldn't quite believe we spent an extra \u00a31.50 on a \"sausage\" which turned out to be two thin slices of sausage. Come on guys we know you're posh but really?! Overall delicious flavours but very small portion that didn't quite justify the price (and I'm not necessarily one for overfilled plates).The baked eggs came in a yummy tomato and pepper sauce with a small dollop of yogurt sprinkled with chili. Again the flavours were strong and morish however I'm not quite sure how they managed to undercook one egg and overcook the other? One was gooey, they other no longer even runny. I was convinced I was going to love Caravan after stopping by for coffee once before and hearing great reviews. I was disappointed with the value as for a \u00a328 breakfast for 2 I expect to feel I've treated myself to a place that hits to spot. It was good but I wouldn't go back.",

I used to live nearby, and this was a frequent brunch spot (although not as frequent as it could have been, due to the pricetag).Brunch aside, there is a fantastic selection of food for lunch and dinner, and there drinks menu is broad. Saying that, I have eaten here for breakfast/brunch on many more occasions than at other times.There is a rotating variety of food, but you should always be able to find something to your taste - even if it's not quite what you were expecting before you looked at the menu. I don't think words can really do it justice, and you should really go yourself and try. Be prepared to wait, however. Ultimately, you are unlikely to be let down if you do.",

I had the luxury of going there on a Monday morning which means I did not have to endure a wait as I would have if I went on a weekend. It's located right at the start of Exmouth Market so you will not miss it.The atmosphere is rustic with lots of natural light coming in. I got the baked eggs which I'm still dreaming about today. My only regret was that I wasn't able to finish it because it was quite a lot of food. The baked eggs came in a mini metal casserole/pot with tomato and pepper ragout. There's an option of adding chorizo, which I did. The dish was drizzled with some Greek yoghurt. The server recommended that I add a slice of toast since the baked egg dish has a good amount of tomato and pepper ragout and I can soak it up with the bread-- fantastic idea. A single slice of the sourdough toast was pretty big so good thing I ordered a slice.Caravan also roasts their own coffee. Bonus points for that.",

I've been to the likes of Monmouth and try to be as excited as my coworkers about its espresso, but Caravan is more my speed (literally, I am buzzing around like a right weirdo after mid-afternoon Monmouth; Caravan was much smoother sailing).Tucked on a side street less than 10 mins from Farringdon Station, Caravan is more bar/restaurant than coffee shop (despite making it to more than a few Best of London Coffee lists AND having its own roastery in the basement). But don't let that deter you, because the food was great, too. Just worth noting in case you're expecting a coffee shop/hunker down and do some work vibe. There are no laptops in Caravan.I had the spicy tomato soup (\u00a35.5) and a side of their famous cornbread (\u00a34) and a fresh lemonade spritzer (\u00a33). The latte was \u00a34, plus 40p for soy. The corn bread was not the fluffy, finely coarsed buttery bread casserole of the American south, but thick slices of loaf style bread with hefty corn pieces and fried. I will repeat that: And. Fried. It came with a garnish of lime and plenty herb butter and was unlike anything I've ever had -- crispy, savory, slightly sweet and pretty much perfect. At 6pm on a Monday, most were enjoying glasses of wine and light bites in groups of 3+. Indoor/outdoor seating that includes picnic style and bistro tables. Total bill for two for a few small plates, two coffees and two non alkie drinks was \u00a333 (including 12% service charge).Speaking of service, it was excellent right up until the end, when it took 25 minutes and asking three times to get the bill.",

    "text": "I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning. What a delightful brunch it was. First off, let me say the location is adorable. It's located on a \u00a0street with a whole bunch of little restaurants. It was the cutest thing I saw. The road is blocked off so you can't drive down it. But who would want it?! Way cuter to take the stroll. I wasn't feeling my snazziest due to a night of partying in Leicester Square the night before. I spotted the outdoor seating and decided we HAD to. We went in and were offered coffee as we sat by the coffee bar awaiting our seat. My friend, Denise C., ordered a cappuccino and I sat quietly observing how polite everyone was. The cappuccino was adorable! They made a leaf looking thing in it. So cute. When you give your name and wait to be called they give you a bag of coffee beans with a number on it. Creative and the smell of the coffee beans was a nice pick me up.We were seated at a little table out front after no more than 15 minutes. I decided on a ginger carrot turmeric drink because I hear turmeric is supposed to be really good for you. I needed SOMETHING to cure that night I had. To go along with my healthy fresh drink, i ordered the flour tortilla with eggs, beans, salsa and a side of amazingness. I'll start with the drink. It was definitely fresh (especially since I think my waitress forgot about it and I had to ask again). They were little chunks of freshness and the slight spice to it was a real wake up. With that drink and my delicious brunch I was cured in minutes. The eggs were tasty and the bean salsa concoction they had going on was out of this world. The perfect amount of flavor to compliment the tortilla and wake up my taste buds. It was all so delicious. I typically don't go for fresh fancy juice. I'm more of a mimosa girl with my brunch but with how I was feeling the juice was perfect and so was the food.I ran downstairs to the restroom. Its located beside the kitchen and in this cool area where I'm assuming they have for family dining style. Its a huge table. I would love to have a bunch of friends down their. The \"loo\" was clean and the soap had a really nice smell.As far as service, the waitress was nice as was the manager. The only thing...there was a young guy that came and sat with friends as we were dining and I don't know if he was some sort of celebrity or if he was an employee but our waitress and a few other employees were waiting on this kid hand and foot. Our waitress didn't really check on us that much but they were all hanging off of him. lol It was pretty weird to watch. But none the less I really enjoyed my experience here.I'll definitely return when I'm back in the UK.",

I will certainly be frequenting this place often to taste their Rwandan coffee and other exotic blends!",

However, the shredded duck salad I ordered came out super fast. \u00a0Not a problem, except the duck in the otherwise tasty salad was dry , chewy and hardly shredded. I had to hack away at large chunks of it to make it chewable and digestible. It was quite dry. \u00a0Truth be told it is my first time eating duck in London, but I lived in Paris for one year. \u00a0It is possible to keep duck for duck salad from being completely dry and chewy yes? And even if not, if one orders shredded duck salad, the duck should be shredded \u00a0right? Anyway, at 15 pounds for the salad I was a bit dissatisfied. Last night I ate up at Niche on Rosebery and had a cobb salad that was cheaper and way better. \u00a0But maybe it's impossible to keep duck tender for shredded duck salad, and I am in the wrong here. A nice environment for drinks nonetheless.",

We started out with hot chocolate and lattes, which I got a huge kick out of because they draw patterns in the foam. My friends weren't completely happy with the choices but Caravan was very accommodating and they were able to create their own eggs Benedict's by ordering the sourdough bread with poached eggs and getting sides of hollandaise, goat cheese, mushrooms, etc. They also got the orange-scented pancakes which are probably the best pancakes I've tried in Europe so far--extremely fluffy and flavorful! The blueberry compote on top was also wonderful.I ordered a blueberry muffin, sourdough with butter, and the cornbread French toast. The French toast was so good that I finished it in literally ten minutes. The unexpected combination of sweet and savory with the added bitterness of the arugula was exactly what I was looking for. As many before me have said, their sourdough bread was delicious. My only disappointment was the muffin, which I found too sweet and dense for my liking.Prices overall were pretty good considering how expensive London is in general.We plan to come here one more time before leaving London next week and I'm already excited for it!",

The flavor combinations on the menu are not your typical French Toast and Fry-up. They are exciting and attention-grabbing. The Baked Eggs with Tomato Ragout, Greek Yogurt, and Chorizo caught my attention and my friend and I had it to share. Gorgeous combination of spicy sausage, palate cooling cream, and fresh and peppery ragout. The eggs blended in effortlessly. Home Run. Might come again for that alone.Though as we sat outside, eyeing the menu, I noticed other unlikely brunch ideas such as Cornbread French Toast, Bacon, Rocket, and Avocado. Along with Grilled Coconut Bread, Strawberries, and Lemon Curd Cream Cheese. Goes without saying that I'll be back. Definitely on the high-end breakfast side and is a hell of a wait at the busy times. My only negative was the manager telling some people that they had to pay or leave when they used their laptops after their food was done. I am not a fan of that- but seeing how busy they get, I do understand that everyone should get a chance to enjoy this place sitting down!Possible dinner items on my \"Salivate List\"--Arabica Oxtail, Herbs, Creme Fraiche Polenta--Sichuan Salt and Pepper Pork Belly with Tofu Salad, Gooseberries, Mache, and Pumpkin Seeds--Almond Couscous, Tomato Ragout, Aubergine, and Sumac Yoghurt",

We were all starving & salivating at the sight of all the dishes that passed by. We decided on sharing everything, which I'm a huge fan of because then we can try everything.ORANGE SCENTED PANCAKES, HONEYCOMB BUTTER & BLUEBERRIES - Mmmmmm. A stack of 2, light pancakes with a huge glob of their honeycome butter on it and a side of blueberry jam. Fan-freaking tastic. Highly recommend getting this and sharing.BAKED EGGS, TOMATO & PEPPER RAGOUT, GREEK YOGURT W/ CHORIZO - Very tasty. Although not really typical of breakfast food, it was still very nice this early in the day. Get some extra bread to dip in to this as well.CORNBREAD FRENCH TOAST, BACON, ROCKET, AVOCADO, W/ PAPRIKA MAPLE - One of my favorites at the table! Not too sweet, but still soooooo good. I love the sweet mixed with savory. CHILLI BEANS, GOAT CHEESE, & FRIED EGG ON GRAIN TOAST - My friends loved this. I was indifferent, but if you're a fan of all that is listed then you'll probably love it too.The food & service is all pretty good. If you're coming in on the weekends, be prepared for a wait.

Straight away they got I was beat and just needed a good meal and a good glass of wine. I had the great fortune of being servers by Niamh and Simon. They guided my food and wine choices with skill.

It is such a creative combination of trendy items and so yummy. I look forward to going back and trying other things on the menu including the espresso martini that everyone seemed to be drinking!",

I'd come back here again for brunch - no super long lines and a cute ambiance with natural light makes for an excellent brunch. I wouldn't necessarily trek across London to come here, but if you're in the area or relatively close by, it's a great place.Red quinoa & oat almond milk porridge (\u00a36) - This came with bananas and dates for a little natural sweetness, and it was hearty and healthy. Jalapeno cornbread, frijoles negros, fried eggs, avocado (\u00a39.50) - I've never had savory French toast before, and this was fantastic. I love cornbread and Mexican food, so this was a perfect combination and very unique. I'd highly recommend this! Overall, great selection of food - we enjoyed our meal a lot and my Mom kept wanting to come back here for breakfast/brunch. They have a good selection of sweet / savory / healthy / indulgent options, so everyone should be able to find something they want to eat.",

It can get a bit crowded but if you have to wait to get a table it shouldn't take long. The brunch menu is so great that it was hard to choose what to order. The first time I was here, I asked the waiter for his opinion and he suggested the jalape\u00f1o cornbread with tomatillo salsa, cotija, and eggs -- I'm glad I took his advice, because it was incredible! The cornbread had the texture of polenta but was much more flavorful, and the cotija and salsa paired so well together. The plate was large but we took our time eating and I finished the whole thing. I ordered the aubergine puree and egg plate the second time, which was also delicious although it could have used a bit more seasoning. My friend didn't like the smoothie bowl that she ordered but our waiter took it off of the bill without us even requesting it. Great, friendly staff, delicious food, reasonable prices, and a cozy atmosphere -- I definitely recommend coming here for brunch!",

The oats banana spirulina smoothie tastes amazing and is becoming one of my breakfast regulars at home :-) It's the London price you pay for very good food - reading a little pricey for the portion size but we've come to terms with that situation - I personally don't mind, just be aware if you are a good eater and very hungry. The bit that annoyed me as aspiring vegan - you better like granola if you're like-minded. It's literately the only vegan option. Even the toast with tomato or mushroom comes covered in butter (menu doesn't mention butter so you won't find out until it is served) and the mushrooms are actually cooked in butter which, apart from not vegan, is generally speaking not a great idea cause you should not heat butter. They are not able to use oil even if you ask! Last but not least, they charge 50p for soya milk on top of 2.80 for the coffee. Really? Pretending to be a hipster place but punishing those with lactose intolerance or ethical convictions...Not sure really how many stars to award. 5 if you want a glossed over hipster place with good food, only 2 if you were expecting an authentic place, where one big sparkly star is for taste and the second one for the lovely smiley waitress who served us",

Why has no one thought of this before!? Simply wonderful and achieved that super fine balance of sweet and savory in one dish that I always dream of in a breakfast. Harmony! Satisfied! I was lucky enough to arrive on a perfectly crisp and sunny brunchy morning midweek (Wednesday) so avoided any wait times (a la weekend). I was quickly seated and equipped with water and drinks while I awaited my dining companion. Service was friendly, but a bit aloof/absentminded. Drinks from the bar/barista took unusually long -- but I was not in \u00a0rush so it wasn't terribly important. They do quite a bit of takeaway coffee business as well so I presume it backs up the bar. Their brunch menu is succinct, but packs a punch. Ask around and you'll definitely hear \"cornbread french toast\" muttered more than once, so take the hint and try for yourself. A must in Exmouth Market. Add it to the rotation!",

I'd been warned the price can stack up, so we ordered fairly carefully - but it was all absolutely delicious. The menu was full of really interesting ideas - lots of unusual ingredients or combinations - some fusion and some more traditional stuff.I had warm, slightly toasted cornbread (with regular butter, not the advertised chilli one as I'm allergic to it) - and a 'small plate' of asparagus and poached egg with a really interesting sweet miso sauce. It all went really well with the cornbread - and I shared a side dish of sprouting broccoli with a sort of blackbean sauce with my friend. She had some peanut and blue cheese wantons (no, not my kind of thing either!) but she enjoyed them - and some cured salmon with cucumber... and we both had the chocolate espresso pudding for dessert. I asked for mine 'extra gooey' in the middle - and it came exactly right, with plenty of sauce oozing out, which is always the best bit of a chocolate fondant. Since they're a specialist coffee roaster, I had a decaff americano, but maybe the decaff isn't their strong suit... I can't wait to go back for brunch, though - and some of that cornbread french toast.",

There are many things that changed the world and will continue to do so, but coffee ain't one of them. The guys that run this place simply screw what they can from poor coffee growers in third world countries and live in posh houses in gentrified parts of London and then say they are doing something worthwhile - I don't think so!

    "text": "Continuing the relentless takeover of the London coffee scene by Antipodeans, Caravan makes its battle cry heard not only with its delicious coffee (roasted on premises), but also with delicious food. Run by Kiwis, including Miles Kirby, who was chef at The Providores & Tapa Room in Marylebone for the past six years. So, these guys are the real deal. We had brunch there recently and were happy with our food. We sampled a scrumptious cheese muffin, light and fluffy scrambled eggs on thick sourdough, savoury and not greasy salt beef fritters, spicy chorizo, delectable coconut bread with lemon curd and tamarillo and cornbread french toast with bacon, avocado and rocket. All for about \u00a312 each, including service (all tips go to the staff). Caravan is one of the newest additions to the Exmouth Market scene. It's located where the old and dingy Al's Bar was. The restaurant is bright, airy and welcoming. If you like architectural details, then check out their light fixtures - superb - and notice that they serve water out of Piquot coffee pots (they bought on eBay, of course) - niiice touch!",

    "text": "Caravan in Clerkenwell is a new brasserie with food inspired by Australia and New Zealand. Opened in late 2010, Caravan has already had a big impact in the local area and has had some great reviews including 4 stars from Timeout Magazine. My first impression was of a relaxed but fun atmosphere with subtle lighting and even though it was fairly busy, it managed to feel quite cosy. It seems to be 'new thing' to do Big and Small plates on a menu these days. Small plates are more like tapas that you share, where as Big Plates are more like a normal size main meal. As someone who likes to try many different types of food, small plates seem to suit me fine. We started with some unusual but yummy Blue Cheese and Peanut Butter Wontons and had Fried Chicken with Watermelon and Crispy Seabass with Thai Noodles for main, both of which were very tasty. Along with a lovely bottle of red wine and a scrummy Blueberry cocktail to finish, I left Caravan not only feeling satisfied but excited at the thought that I will return in the future to enjoy the treats they have in store for me. itsnosmallthing.weebly.c\u2026",

    "text": "An impromptu dinner date with an antipodean friend led us to Caravan what a disappointment! Service was very poor \u00a0the main problem seemed to be the lack of any kind of organisation coupled with almost universally space-cadetty staff, who were friendly just super disorganised. The outcome: long waits, inability to catch attention, wrong food orders arriving, mistakes on the bill. I can imagine that with the place half full of people drinking coffee, they might be able to pull it off, but a busy dinner service, no chance! Fine, well, what about the food then? Also extremely disappointing. We got a bunch of the smaller plates, all of which sounded great, but completely failed to live up to their promise. We had: minute steak (poorly cooked, under-seasoned and didn't think much about the toast/mayo thing); tofu and bean shoots in a vietnamese sauce, which completely lacked any punch; cured salmon, also curiously lacking in flavour; courgette pancake, a bit doughy but ok; duck egg, morcilla, and salsa, again lacking in flavour; something else that I genuinely can't remember (!). A good bottle on wine barely saved the night (credit to the wine list, it has a bunch of interesting, though pricey, bottles on it). I want to like this place, it's got a good vibe and an interesting concept, but I just can't see myself willingly going back there, especially considering the many other great options on Exmouth Market and in the local area.",

It was good to be able to try so many dishes, and also there are no arguments when the bill comes because you've all had the same thing. You can specify at the time of booking how many vegetarians there'll be, if anyone has food allergies etc and the chef will take this into account. What I like is that it doesn't feel stiff and cut off from the action like some private dining rooms in restaurants can do, as you can see what's going on in the kitchen and hear the buzz upstairs \u00a0as well as be as noisy as you want in your own party without bothering tables around you.

Taste the Sichuan Salt & Pepper Pork Belly, the classic Schnitzel, seared onglet, the squid pancake, the lamb chump with pepper and mint, the amazing rabbit confit with black pudding terrine and you'll be transported to somewhere twice the price and impossible to book a table. But not Caravan. Put your name on the list and wait with some first class cocktails or really clever choices that make up the affordable wine list. And then when you sit down you'll be ready. Afterwards, linger to enjoy one of the variety of coffees roasted downstairs. Caravan is an important addition to the street where Moro used to stand all by itself.

    "text": "I was really excited to go there, so on a Sunday noon I walked down all the way from Camden to Caravan through sunny beautiful London. When I arrived there, it was pretty busy, I went in, looked for a place, and took a seat at one of several free tables. Soon one of the staff came around and I asked her if I need to order at the counter or if she would bring me a menu.Not long after that another service staff came along to tell me, that I should stand up and wait at the bar for about ten minutes, because this table was already taken. A few seconds later the other service woman came back with a water and the menu - how nice! But I had to tell her, that her colleague just told me to leave (or to wait ...). Sorry Caravan, but that really ruined my Sunday! This is definitely not the experience you want to have on a lazy sunny Sunday noon. Pretty much it is one of the worst possible experiences you could have on a nice and sunny Sunday when you're hungry and excited. The table I chose was completely empty, no left overs or anything, nothing that indicated that you need to register somewhere to get a table. Quite annoying. And actually, yes, unprofessional - if one waitress gives you the menu and the other kicks you out. So I cannot assess the food or the coffee, but anyway I think that ruining my Sunday noon deserves a bad rating! Instead of waiting for ten minutes, I made my way to Scandinavian Kitchen in Fitzrovia, thus my Sunday was saved. But Caravan, sorry, you've messed it up for now.",

Whereas it was the scruffy and apatheticly so-so Al's Bar, it's now a light and accommodating dining space with prompt and friendly service. The menu is a perfect balance of intrigue and satisfaction - keep it in mind for weekend brunching when gluttons, gourmands and health nuts will all find suitable choices. The wine list, beers and booze are no fuss but well assembled. Coffee drinks live up to Kiwi standards. Most mains cost around \u00a310 (portions are reasonable) with prices for starters, drinks etc falling inline accordingly. I'm not in love with Caravan, but the one time I dined here, I really liked it. One more yummy option for Clerkenwell - hooray!",

    "text": "I reguallally eat brunch in London and 'Caravan' has, so far, given me the best fry-up in London. If I can call it a fry-up that is as that seems to make it sound tacky - which it certainly isn't. Everything is brilliant about it, from the way that consistently come and re-fill your glass of water to the exceptional food. I had a fry-up with scrambled eggs which were certainly the best scrambled eggs I've had so far, the rest of the plate was also amazing which makes it the best fry-up I've had in London, the coffee tasted 'fresh' and lovely (it is roasted downstairs which you can check out if you pop to the loo), the service was polite, helpful and 'smiley' and the d\u00e9cor is modern and airy with little add-ons like the lights and the bar thus making 'Caravan' the best brunch and my favourite cafe in London. It is easy to get to with a short walk up from Farringdon and along from Angel. For those, like me, who weren't up for walking at that early hour (laaaazy) get the 38 bus from Angel which stops right outside. I recommend the full breakfast and the filter coffee and flat whites are great. I will be back soon to sample the other delights on the menu.",
