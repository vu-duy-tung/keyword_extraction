    "text": "I was first introduced to the joys of Taylor Street by a Richmond-dwelling friend, Sam. She'd discovered the Tolley family's dedication to caffeine over a few morning chats at Source, the supermarket by the station. They'd been questioning her each day to find out what she wanted from her coffee, what flavours she liked, until they found the blend that rocked her world. In the face of such excellent customer service and passion, she'd been raving ever since and, as she's not one to rave without reason, I knew a trip south west was in order. She was right. Indeed, the coffee was so good, I almost regretted moving from that area to North London a few years before. However, those Aussie siblings have now expanded with a City branch that should: a) help them build that reputation; and b) keep me very happy in weeks, months and years to come. With these chaps, Monmouth and Flat White spread around the place, London has the makings of a PROPER coffee culture. Oh, and you have to love the irony of Taylor St opening opposite a Starbucks. Mind you, they're not in the same business. Taylor St make beautiful drinks. Starbucks well, do they have any redeeming qualities?",

    "text": "Definitely the best coffee you will find in the Liverpool St. area. Taylor St Baristas has four locations, the New St. store being the latest edition. It is quite ironic that the store is located across the street from Starbucks, pumping out coffees of a quality that the worlds biggest coffee chain will never come close to.The fact that it is located right in the business district means that it is often quite busy, mainly in the mornings. I like the idea that the people who work in the offices around the area may be cutting out chain coffee stores, and supporting a small business where they actually get there moneys worth.The staff really know what they are doing. The crafty designs on the coffee show that the barista has a good relationship with the milk. The milk is creamy and consistant, and the shots of coffee are just right.",

The baristas are obviously coffee obsessed, but their passion for good coffee is evident when you taste their creations. \u00a0The sign outside underlines the fact that the caf\u00e9 is run by Aussie baristas, who are in training for 2 to 3 years, and who see coffee making as an art which must be perfected. \u00a0You may laugh, but seriously, the first time you have a good coffee can be more a curse, all other coffee is ruined for you. \u00a0 What more can I say? \u00a0I just hope they'll open up a caf\u00e9 with more space and seating, I don't always want my coffee to take away.",

As you may well know, if you're partial to an occasional caffeine fix the 'big smoke' can be a surprisingly hard place to get a decent hit. But these guys really know their stuff, from ethical sourcing to expert roasting. Tucked down a quiet alleyway just opposite Liverpool Street station, the smell of freshly ground coffee lured many a passerby into the midst of our newly found caffeine appreciation club. They might have been closed for business but this didn't stop them serving up their expert brew with a really warm sense of customer service. The selection of coffees available were as varied as they were good, and I was a little dumbfounded to discover the taste of real blueberries in my last espresso. In fact they were all so good it seemed a waste to taste and spit as suggested, so a few heart palpitations (and 10 coffees) later I was well set for a speedy trip around the Saturday markets.",

I didn't wanna seem dumb, so I let the guy keep talking, and tried to sift his Australian accent and it slowly dawned on me that Antipodes were people from Australia and New Zealand... \u00a0My mathematical + latin grammar helped me with the rest...Anyway, the guy clued me in about the story of how the Aussies had brought coffee to london a couple of years ago, and that it was a rather new movement. \u00a0Then he started rattling off the treasure trove of information, the insiders guide to coffee in London. \u00a0Milk Bar, Flat White, Clemson, Fernandez... \u00a0My mind danced with excitement, while I fiddled for a pen and notebook. \u00a0I was now on a quest!",

    "text": "Taylor St Baristas is a small but, hopefully, group of high quality coffee bars. They have branches in Brighton and Richmond, and a morning pop-up shop in St Paul's, but the venue I tend to visit is in Liverpool Street. It is situated on a side street across from the Bishopsgate, and opposite a Starbucks. It is rather a narrow, crampt cafe but it sells some of the best coffee in London. The cafe is run by Australians (and possibly some Kiwis too) who, as at Flat White in Soho, specialise in the flat white; stronger than a latte with a roughly 2:1 coffee to milk ratio and \"coffee art\" in the foam. It is a great looking and tasting coffee. They also sell food, which is good too. They have porridge in the morning with a pick'n'mix range of toppings (the dried apple and brown sugar is my favourite). They also have a range of toasties and muffins which are baked on site. The atmosphere is lively with music playing (there seems to be a tendency towards good Antipodean stuff like the Bamboos and Fat Freddy's Drop). The service is friendly and personal. It is not particularly cheap; a flat white costs \u00c2\u00a32.20. However, they do have one of the best loyalty cards I've seen: 4 coffees and get one free. This is a great coffee bar. Definitely bypass Starbucks and go here.",

The only negative apart from not having a card machine is that the size of the place is tiny. Its not a place to go to chill out, its more of a walk in, walk out kind of place. It would be nice sometimes to sit down and enjoy the coffee in the warm environment, rather than having it on the go. But overall, a 5 star for me since its all about the coffee for me.",

Every time I walk past this place, there's always a long queue of people ordering coffee. However, you do get served incredibly quickly, with the staff coming up to you to take your order even if you're standing right at the back of the shop, and the coffee's served quickly and efficiently without any loss in quality.

The coffee here is good, however, it is on the lighter side. So not as bitter as I prefer. But it is still good. That's just a warning, probably don't drink it with milk or get a double shot - if you prefer a stronger bean. This is not a sit down cafe but rather a grab and go kind of place. They have a few cakes and things but other than that it is a coffee place. And because I love coffee I wasn't going to complain about.",

I've been frequenting this place for the past couple weeks and its one of the better coffee offerings I've experienced in the city so far (I always get a large Americano, dash of milk). It is expensive, but with the loyalty card you could get 1 free coffee/week and then the average price more on par with other lesser quality places nearby. The dairy-free Bircher is too legit to quit...(seriously though I'm spending so much money on breakfast). :-/The baristas are really friendly, its a pretty efficient operation and the newly added disco ball-light-thing is a nice touch. :) Gets your day started with a good party. I might turn down the music volume just a touch, so that I could better hear what the baristas/cashiers are saying to me, but that's a really minor point. Overall, highly recommend!",

The sandwiches look tasty (didn't try) and so do the cakes; the orange cake was very good. One star off for the poor ventilation, which allowed all the odours from the kitchen to spread into the sitting area.",

We were served quickly by a chatty and friendly guy - two flat whites and two lime, raspberry and pistachio muffins.The coffee looked beautiful with patterns in the top - both different - and the taste was delicious. Mine reminded me of a box of chocolates every time which seems odd for a coffee! Lovely and creamy smooth too. I would have liked mine hotter, ideally.The muffins were a good size and very tasty with a nice texture and plenty of nuts.The place is tiny but we were lucky enough to perch on top of a couple of tall stools at the tiny shelf (it doesn't justify table!) and have a leisurely time.Our bill was a bit on the high side, but the quality was top notch; the best coffee I've had in a long while.

To get people through the door you'd expect to see the baristas rushing and working as quickly as they can. Not the case. They seem to move in slow motion in comparison to the rest of the busy staff - clearly very particular about their standards.

Although - in the rare event that you are - there is even a safety net here because there is a sign promising that if the coffee is below par, they are happy to give you a replacement - customer service at its best.The coffee is a little bit pricey for my liking, but I appreciate that they know their clientele well (City-types willing to part with the cash for a decent cup of joe, like myself). I also haven't tried the food but it all looks delicious and it seemed they had a lot of breakfast regulars, which is testament to that. The place is small, with no space to sit from what I could see, so it's only suitable for your on the go fix. However - I visited the branch near Bank for a comparison and that is a proper coffee shop haven that left me wondering if it's open at the weekends so I could hole myself up there with a book. Off to write a lovely review for that now...",
