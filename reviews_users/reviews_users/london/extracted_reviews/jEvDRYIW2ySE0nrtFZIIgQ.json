The most notable sign that its got a good reputation was the fact that it was packed and they were continually turning a stream of people away at the door.",

Took them 15 minutes to get our drink, took them ONE HOUR for our meal to come out...it was 7PM already, I was so angry and asked them to bring out our dessert at the same time as our main meal- my daughter was starving and she had to wait for one hour for her meal!!!! We finished our dinner at 7:20 made a rush walk to the Lyceum theatre, but when we walked out the restaurant the black waiter shouted at me think we have not paid?? WT@????? I pretended don't hear him and walked out, then I think why do I have to pay the additional service tip if the service is absolutely rubbish??? Food was OK but having said that I will never go back there neither recommend this place for pre theatre dinner, and definitely NOT FOR FAMILY!!!!!!",

Situated opposite Covent Garden Piazza, the restaurant adds a touch of Parisian flair to the area.With the art deco posters, stunning chandelier and staff dressed in classic black and white, I always feel like I have stepped back into 1930s Paris whenever I dine here. I first went to Palm Court for a friend's birthday and I have been going ever since. I had my own birthday dinner there three years ago and the staff were very patient when we couldn't decide what to order! The food is excellent and I have always been more than satisfied with whatever I've ordered. My favourite dishes are definately the rump of lamb and the seared prawns. I never have room for dessert but friends always seem to be more than happy with the dessert cocktails. I have heard such good things about the Angel's Treat (rum, amaretto and cream) that I will definately be ordering it next time!",

The decor was wonderful as was the service throughout our meal. We both had the French onion soup and enjoyed it immensely as we did the steak for 2 cooked to medium rare perfection. Substituting the cauliflower for the green beans proved no problem. The Rose was chilled to perfection. Dessert was also great. Dress says formal but we noticed many more casually attired folk. I love the location of this place - seemed right in the heart of London's nightlife. I would highly recommend this restaurant to all comers.",

From start to finish was terrible - couldnt have felt more like we were unwanted. \u00a0As soon as we got in, there was a vile, overpowering smell of urine, and for some bizarre reason, they thought that by blasting cold air from the AC, that it was going to mask the odour, unfortunately all it did was make us freeze...!Long story short, we asked for a warmer table, were given a colder one, we ordered very simple dishes (we were told we could only have one course) and of the two dishes, 1 and half dishes were returned untouched....and the manager on the evening was like, shrug, dont care...never ever ever would I contemplate going again, or recommend anyone else to...",

Nothing exciting on the plate. I got the pork chop, and it was pretty chewy and the seasoning seemed to just be salt/a salty sauce. The mashed potatoes, pretty bland, had RAW onions in them. No, that's not a cool touch of \"flair\"--it's stupidity. And the apple, advertised as \"caramelized,\" was definitely not. Just baked and mushy. But the taste of the apple was welcome compared to the rest. I had just put down my fork after taking a bite and my plate was swept away by the waitress. Also it was hot in there. I just knew this place wouldn't be good after looking at the format of the menu--trying to be French, and no, they didn't succeed.",

    "text": "I am often in London to go to a show so what I usually do is make sure that I choose somewhere to eat that is close by but also does a pre-theatre meal so I can ensure that I am all full before I go and watch my show. We were recommended the Palm Court Brasserie by my Aunty and Uncle as they go there every time they are in London. We thought we may as well try so we found ourselves back in July and I am planning another trip for February. Here is why I think that it is a nice, efficient, modern and delicious place to go to. Ok so first the address; Palm Court Brasserie London.39 King StreetCovent GardenLondonWC2E 8JS Ok so in terms of location this restaurant has it all really. Right in the heart of London in Covent Garden the setting is gorgeous. You are right in the centre of the shops, bars, entertainment and theatres so you cannot fail but to find it but also to enjoy it there. There is so much to see around this area and I think this restaurant has a prime position in theatre land. We found it easy to find but I would recommend taking the number down just in case you get lost at all. From the outside it looks very cosy with a nice sign which looks kind of old fashioned with Palm Court Brasserie written clearly so you can see it. There is a small window and door and you can see the nice dim lights inside and it does look instantly inviting. Ok so you walk in and immediately to your left you have the bar which is extremely well stocked and when we there the barman were all up for entertaining everybody which was great fun. There is always somebody there to serve you and there are lots of bar stools so you can always get a seat. On the right is the start of the restaurant tables which are very simple metal tables and chairs and they look very elegant and again cosy. In fact everything about this place is cosy and friendly so you feel at ease there. The toilets are a short walk to your right and then as you walk down you will see lots more tables and chairs and the place always seemed to be busy while we were there. The staff were brilliant with everybody being friendly and helping everybody else out. They had very good sense of humour which was nice and made our meal a very pleasant one indeed. The bar is well stocked so drinks wise you don't really have any problems. The prices are London prices so do expect to pay about \u00a35 for a glass of wine and about \u00a33 for a glass of a soft drink. Expensive I know but what you expect from the centre of London in such a nice area and restaurant. The menus for food are fantastic. They have a good range of starters such as soup and fishcakes. Then main meals you can choose from meat, grill or pasta salad dishes and they have a good selection of each. Then for pudding you could have ice creams or crumble and many more. The prices are about \u00a34 for starters, \u00a39 - 12 for mains and \u00a34 for desserts. What we had though was a pre-theatre menu so they basically give you a few choices and they make sure you are out before the shows start which is generally half 7 in the evening. A 3 course meal like this cost \u00a313 which is not bad at all. We had choices with a vegetarian meal included in the menu. I had spinach and feta cheese salad followed by salmon followed by apple crumble which was delicious. Everybody else had steak which looked nice also. The food does fill you up and it is well prepared so I was impressed. I think everybody takes care over everything at this place which was of course great to see and I enjoyed my time there immensely. The prices were fine and they have a good choice of food and then couple this with the fact that the restaurant is in a brilliant location and is very well stocked and appearance is brilliant I think you cant go wrong here. I would return as I think everything was just lovely and I would recommend to anybody travelling to this area. I don't think it would be wise to drive to go to the restaurant as it is so much easier to get the tube to Covent Garden which doesn't take long from wherever you are in London. Recommended and I think you will all be glad if you go and like it as much as I did. Thanks for reading. xxx P.S. This has been posted on other sites but always by me katygriff",

We celebrated the New Year's Eve dinner with the 3-course \u00a350 prix-fix menu that started with a kir royale. I had the delicious asparagus feta salad, fresh, flavorful sea bass atop a bead of lentils and finished with an exquisite cr\u00e8me br\u00fble! They had a nice wine selection and full bar as well. The atmosphere was vibrant and very welcoming.",

The atmosphere is very Persian and brasserie like but I do have to mention that it was very hot inside. Not sure if their AC was not working but it was to the point that it was uncomfortable. Service was outstanding considering that the place was packed. Wonderful wine list served by the glass, bottle and even half bottle. Generous menu with reasonable prices. My husband commented that he has had better steaks but his french onion soup was outstanding. The duck liver I started with was average but still delicious. The moules marini\u00e8res were incredible, perfectly cooked with a white wine cream sauce that is to die for. If you are in the area, they also boast a nice lunch and pre-theater menu that offer two courses for \u00a314.95 or three for \u00a317.95. I would return and highly recommend the moules.",

We went for drinks elsewhere first, but then came here at about 8pm. \u00a0It's easy to find in the hussle and bussle of Covent Garden. \u00a0It is very dim lighting and seemed to be a lot of couples. \u00a0It did have a nice atmosphere for dates so I would recommend it if you are looking for somewhere nice to go - maybe more of a 2nd or 3rd date place than 1st date though.Prices are very reasonable for such a central and touristy area of London. \u00a0 I had the confit de canard and it was very very nice. \u00a0Not too dry and a nice size portion. \u00a0My brother had a the lamb and my mum had the half roast chicken with chasseur sauce. \u00a0Both had clean plates and happy looks on their face so must have been good. \u00a0Mum and I couldn't resist a dessert, even though we were full, so shared the creme brulee. \u00a0It was very nice and creamy. \u00a0Drinks wise, as I am on Dry January (not that I've mentioned it), I didn't have a lot of choice so just had lime and soda. \u00a0My brother sampled numerous cocktails, including the French Revolution aperitif (I was drooling, it looked so nice) and the Angel Delight (I think that was the name) after dinner cocktail. \u00a0My mum decided to support me and have a cranberry juice. \u00a0Our waiter was very nice and helpful, and went out of his way to help us (including fixing a wobbly table). Overall, very nice place and I will be back next time I am looking for somewhere to eat in Covent Garden. The red wine selection in particular looked great so I need to try it!",

The Maitre d' was very nice and accommodating as he had a table available but only for an hour, as the table was reserved. We jumped on it and were happy with our choice. We absolutely did not feel rushed although the place was packed. My son had the seafood linguini which was full of beautiful gigantic prawns and mussels. I had the Boeuf Bourgignon with mashed potatoes. The meat was beautifully tender and the beef gravy rich and so delicious I could have slurped the last of it and licked the plate - normally I rarely finish my meal but had no trouble with this one. It was all piping hot. I couldn't resist a crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert, also very delicious. I have high standards for creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which seems deceptively simple but can be easily ruined.The whole meal including beer was under 50 pounds. It was noisy of course and crowded but the waitstaff kept their cool and navigated the narrow room like it was choreographed. Mostly we were surprised and thrilled to find a decent meal for a decent price at Coventry Garden!",

Selection of 4 dishes for each of the 3 courses was given. Nice mix catering for all. It started of well with complimentary fizzy cocktails on arrival. As we had preordered, the starters came out promptly. I had gone for the Duck Terrine with bread crisps and a berry compote. Was actually quite nice. I then had the Sea Bass to try and avoid the typical Turkey dinner which could just be sitting there for hours. The Sea Bass was ok, one of the thinnest fillets I've ever had. The sauce was over powered by the sheer volume of olives and the skin on the fillet was soggy to the point it was inedible and you could only just eat around it. I felt it was more of a starter than a main. We then had to wait a while for our desserts as the restaurant had soon filled up with other customers. I had gone for the cheese board. What I was given was a few crackers and one small slice of blue cheese. You can't really call it a cheese board if it comes with only one cheese. What also appeared on the plate was the same compote I had been given in my starter. Very confusing. We weren't given any butter or nor did it come with any grapes. A complete disappointment for me as the others who had either ordered the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e or the Chocolate Pot enjoyed theirs thoroughly. Maybe a place where it is hit or miss on what individual dishes you have, so in my case it wasn't a great experience. (Visit - 17/12/2014 Lunch)",
