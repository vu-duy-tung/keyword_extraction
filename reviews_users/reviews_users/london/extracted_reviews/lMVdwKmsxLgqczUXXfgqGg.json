    "text": "I went here while visiting London. Robert D. had recommended it as one of his favorite Indian restaraunts in the city. We got reservations, which was a great idea since we had a party of 5. As soon as we walked in the restaraunt, the wonderful smell of delicious food filled the room. We couldn't wait to get our food.We started out with the cheese nan, which was super yummy. We had to order more because it went so fast. I got the Kadu Sabhji which is pumpkin cooked in Punjabi style. It was super spicey, which I love. I think it was the best dish on the table. I tried everyone elses and I really liked the Sag, which is spinach cooked Punjabi style. Their were two chicken dishes ordered and I prefered the spicey one, though I don't remember the dish name. The lamb was probably my least favorite, although it was still quite good. Our wait staff was a lot of fun. The decor was interesting. The pillars in the room were covered in a wooden material that swept up and out over the ceiling as if it was a modern art tree. I wish I would have taken a pic. It was very cool. Anyway, this place has been in business for 60+ years and I can tell you that with the wonderful food that they serve their it will be in business for 60+ more. Thanks Robert for the great recommendation!",

The way we were treated last saturday was appalling and I would never recommend this resataurant to anyone ever again. I have been to this restaurant twice and my husband's been there atleast 10 times. We were under the impression that this is a good establishment until this saturday when we were asked not to even come into the restaurant as our toddler was shouting while we were at the door. The guy told us at the door that we cannot go in as our toodler was making a lot of noise and that we would be disturbing all other diners. He didnt even check if we could calm him down (the screaming lasted 30 seconds only and was because he was hungry, if we were given a table and he was fed he would have been content and quite!). He was very rude and spoke to us in hindi as we are indians too and he ASSUMED that we would understand the language! what audacity!! Why would he do that? It was not like we were there at dinner time when people would not welcome a screaming child next to their table, we were there to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary on a saturday at lunchtime!! I saw from the previous reviews that another Indian gentleman was asked to leave as his order was less than 15 \u00a3, it makes me think that this kind of callous attitude from the staff is reserved for Indians only!! Also why he would not speak to us in english, but shooed us off by speaking in Hindi. We used to have a good regard for this place but now we will never recommend this place to anyone as they are completelly intolerant of having children dine at their establishment and the attitude of the staff is despicable. NEVER AGAIN.",

Just thinking of the menu makes my mouth water \u00a0it's all good. By their condiments (especially the lime pickle) shall ye know them, and if you have a couple of papadums while you consider the menu you'll see that everything here is fresh and just as it should be. I have a particular fondness for the acharri gosht myself. This would be a good place to bring someone who says they don't like Indian food (which is a bit like saying that they don't like 'European food', there's such diversity). If they remain unconvinced then they're just contrary.",

Delicious -- fresh and so nicely balanced that it is fun to try to discern the individual spices even though it all blends so well.I've been going for many years and the staff are always the same and that says so much.

As far as the food goes nothing special the condiments tasted like pre package jar sauces, their chicken masala just another indian dish nothing that a place that claims to be the first indian restaurant in London should taste like. If you want indian food you can probally find another place that has just as good food if not better i suggest for the price of punjab you go eat at dishoom way better service, better food but make a reservation.

We were on the hunt for Indian food, saw a line out the door and figured it would be an hour wait. Don't be deterred by the line outside, it moves very quickly and we were seated within 15 minutes. However the first thing we were told before we sat down was that we had to be out by 8 o'clock, which was about an hour-and-a-half away. That was fine, but a little strange we were being rushed before we had even ordered. The atmosphere was also very basic inside, it's definitely more on the casual side. We decided to order \u00a0a good variety of starters and main plates because we quite enjoy Indian cuisine. We ordered Samosas and papadom with mango chutney to start. The chutney was delicious. We then followed that with chicken tikka masala, vegetable curry, chicken korma and peshwari naan bread. The portions were decently sized, not overwhelmingly big. The food was all good and the naan bread was fantastic. My only issue with Punjab was that we felt rushed the whole time we were there. It felt like they were just waiting to take our plates away and hurry us along so they could seat the next group of people. I noticed they did that with all of the tables in the restaurant, which took away from the experience as a whole. Overall this was a good restaurant.",

We ordered a mixture of chicken, vegetarian, and lamb dishes. All the dishes had their own unique flavor, spice, and aroma. The staff were all attentive and saw to our every need. We all agreed that we would recommend this restaurant to anyone who was looking to have a great Indian meal while in London.",

Please don't. \u00a0Just about everything here has been consistently good, and everyone I've eaten here with has loved it. Despite a minor mix up today with my food being delivered to the adjacent table, service is good if a tiny bit unhurried, and food quality is excellent. A few highlights:Onion pakora - little fritters of gram flour (believe it's chickpea flour) mixed with onions and spice and fried to a delicious crunchHariyali chicken - mentioned by at least one other reviewer, it's a bit showy when it comes sizzling to your table, and it tastes great. Skewered chicken coated in yogurt, coriander, mint, garlic, ginger and chile and cooked in the tandoor. This is my favorite! No sauce, FYI, but some grilled onions underneath are greatBullet naan - naan with garlic and green chiles - not overpoweringly flavored, but really nice alongside the other dishes - I liked the little bit of extra spice this added to my mealOne I won't order again- the mixed vegetable curry - I should've inquired more about this one, as it just wasn't \"green\" enough for me, having lots of potatoes, carrots, and peas in it. Oh well, I'll stick with my okra or saag dishes next timeDo check this little place out. They take Amex, too, for those who care.",

The service is prompt and everybody is incredibly friendly. Our server, Sudarsham, was caring and super friendly, asking us about our trip and our experiences with the restaurant! The manager, Amrit, also was incredibly friendly and invested in our experience. Amrit gave us theater suggestions and tips on the what times were best to go to the restaurant. We went for our second time this evening and are already planning our third trip back to the restaurant (in the same week). We read rave reviews about this restaurant on yelp and could't help adding to them.",

The average curry dish is about 8-9 quids, which is a fine range for restaurants in the Covent Garden area and reasonable for the quality of the food. The curries are flavorful, though it is not the very saucy kind, in case you are someone who enjoys the curry sauce more than the meats in the curry. The tandoori dishes are fantastic; very juicy. Generally, Punjab does exceptional meats, whether grilled or in curry--very tender and juicy. Try the mixed grill for sure! For folks who want cheaper curry and the super saucy kind in a smaller place, you might consider Tiger Spice.",

There is far better to be had in London.",

However the food, which was the main reason I was there, was good, but not great.Best of the dishes was the Pudina Gossht, Lamb marinated in fresh mint cooked with herbs and spices and green peppers. The lamb was succulent and the spicing delicate it was good but not historic. However, the Methi Murgha, chicken with cooked fresh fenugreek, was bland, the pillau had a dirty flavor to it that matched its grayish colour and the bhindi masala was unremarkable.Great atmosphere, whether you're dating or doing business, but there is much better Punjabi food to be had.

As a veggie, my favourite dishes here are the 'pumpkinettes' (on the menu it assures diners that 'Punjabis go crazy for these miniatures pumpkins'), the special kali daal and the aubergine dishes.

If we weren't so full we would have ordered more!The only thing I can say is the service is a bit brusk on cheeriness but fast response times and there wasn't much of a wait between ordering and receiving food.We came in around 2pm on a Thursday and one side was full. By the time we started eating our side had every table occupied as well. The decor of the restaurant is also great with old photographs decorating the walls.Can't wait to return on my next visit to London!",

We each got garlic naan bread and I got basmati rice and he got white rice. I also ordered the cucumber salad. Our selection was so good- the curries were flavorful and rich! My salad was sort of sad, I was expecting larger chunks of vegetables, but it did its purpose in cleanses my palate after eating some curry and naan. Overall, Punjab is definitely a place I recommend and would come back to!",

    "text": "After a lengthy visit at the British Museum, we hungered for some hardy Indian food. Punjab definitely fulfilled this desire. Here is my take on the service, atmosphere, and most importantly, the food.Appetizers:We ordered samosas, a favorite of ours, to start the meal.Rating: 3/5The samosas were decent, but lacked the complexity(in terms of spices) that is necessary for a good samosa.Entrees:I ordered the chicken tikka special; boneless chicken pieces with \u00a0Tandoori Seasoning and onions flamb\u00e9ed in Brandy at the table side. Quite delicious pairing with mint yogurt sauce that comes on the side. My only complaint is that the chicken was mildly dry and some of the onions were burnt to blackness. The sauce helped overcome the dryness.Rating 4/5My son ordered the Methi Murga; pieces of chicken submerged in mildly spicy tomato sauce with onions. He said that the chicken was very good but the sauce was a bit soupy and needed more onions. Rating 4.5/5Desert:I ordered Gulab jamun; it had a pleasing doughy texture although I felt the liquid it was bathing in was overly sweet and overwhelmed the more subtle flavors.Rating 3/5My son ordered mango lassi; mangoes submerged in a sweet syrup. He said it tasted wonderful, with the syrup covering the tartness of the mango but not overwhelming the flavor.Rating 5/5Recommendation: If you are in the area Punjab is a great place to dine.",

    "text": "I have to disappointingly give 3 stars the Punjab. I specifically dragged my friend here for dinner because I wanted to go to the oldest Punjabi restaurant in the U.K. \u00a0The food here is pretty good. We both loved the apps we got (lamb shish and the pumpkin app). My paneer makhani was fine, but I wish it was spicy. Her chicken tikka speciality was a bit smaller than expected. Sugar and mango lassi's were also good. I was not too thrilled that you have to also buy rice. We ended up buying one naan and one basmati. And if we had wanted water we would have paid. But here's where the bigger problem comes. We had no problems with the waiter who seated us and gave us our check. But the waiter who took our orders and brought our food out was a big problem. He's a young guy, probably the youngest there, but that's no excuse for being OFFENSIVE. Let me preface this by saying both my friend and I are American and speak English perfectly without accents (which btw our rude waiter had an accent when he spoke in English) AND YET despite this, he chose to continually say \"arigato\" and \"xie xie\" to my friend, thinking he was cute or funny? I don't know but it's completely unacceptable. It made both of us extremely uncomfortable and he never stopped doing it. Not to mention when he brought my rice out he referred to it as \"arroz\" instead of rice. And he did all of this clearly KNOWING we speak English (better than him for that matter). For these reasons, I'm disappointed that Punjab isn't a place I can recommend to anyone who isn't white or south Asian since our abilities to speak English were questioned while here.",

Punjab also had a queue but that one was significantly shorter. We came here as a group of 5 people but were soon seated in a cushy corner table. The food was amazing, though some were spicy and the staff were super friendly, evoking images of a close knitted family and even posing for pictures with us and at one point, patiently explaining some of Punjab's background with us as they found us standing by a large map on the wall. We were advised to order a variety of dishes and share (which worked out fab for me as I love trying out new foods!!) The menu was expansive but the waiter was patiently and enthusiastically guiding us through it and in the end, we opted for the bold text dishes (which were chef recommendations). Our food arrived promptly and we tucked in. I did admit that I wanted to order more, mainly because it was so good, everyone was fighting for every last morsel! I would definitely be coming back to this long standing establishment, with its genuinely friendly service. It honestly felt like I was in their family home, being treated to home cooked food!! If you want genuine North Indian food then go here! It is also the UK's oldest North Indian restaurant!",

The atmosphere was fine, but nothing special, and the food was a bit overpriced for the quality. All in all, this was a rather lackluster experience with food that was average, at best.

Only the uninitiated will find this close to Indian cooking. Unfortunately, we are spoiled by Delhi's Gulatis, Karims and any number of choices in SFO bay area.Our meal started with Dry Kebabs that were dry and reheated. Excess of food coloring in CTM and shrimp was rubbery. Their Daal and recommended veggies(we had eggplant) were particularly bland and undercooked.

    "text": "Let me start by pointing out that I have an increasingly large Italian friendship base, and one thing that Italian's (in my experience) can't really handle is the classic, mouth melting curry. It took me roughly 11 months to convince my partner that this really was a good place to go, and she's glad I did. The only problem I now have is that I have to argue extensively so that I don't have curry every Friday night.The Punjab is pretty close to a tourist heavy area - not necessarily a bad thing, but the obvious fears of quality/authenticity are apparent. Within 30 seconds of sitting down though, the fears are instantly dispelled. The staff are beyond friendly, the recommendations really strong and most importantly REALLY descriptive. It made it very easy for my partner to pick what type of curry would be best for her (surprisingly not the Korma) and which starters would enable her to be a little more adventurous (she had the pokora, which were the \"right type of spicy\").Beyond the food, the wine selection is, if anything, slightly luxurious for a curry house (I staunchly stuck to my cobra) and received no complaints from my partner, a minor miracle in itself. The best thing about the Punjab for me though is the atmosphere and the place itself. It's a proper curry house - it doesn't set out to be a really pretentious and ultra-modern environment, where you're served minimal portions in a stylish fashion, and it doesn't pander to touristy gimmicks - it's basically like a freshly decorated version of your local curry house - clean, warm and friendly. You will need to book for Friday and weekend slots, and it's always worth trying to get yourself a table on the left side of the restaurant where the atmosphere is a little bit more cosy (and the seating against the walls is a bit comfier than the normal seats). To the right is the primary room, which is great if you have a large group or if you are there on the busier nights, but on an early weekday or early in the day, you can get a little bit lost in the space and feel a little isolated. Beyond that, get the vegetable samosas every time, because the dark red/brown sauce that it comes with is the best thing on the menu.",

Our server was helpful, and our choices were all satisfactorily spicy/not spicy. They were also happy to keep our box of leftovers in their kitchen while we went off to the theater. The other option would have been Dishoom, but I'm glad we didn't go there - the atmosphere at this place is really nice, and Dishoom just seems like it's trying too hard. plus their no reservations policy is a little objectionable.Punjab gets a well deserved 5 stars.",

So the dish is prepared at your table with the server drizzling some alcohol over the chicken tikka dish, which comes out on a sizzling hot plate. The guy lights the alcohol on fire!!!!

I waited until a waiter brought me a box for my leftovers to ask for a masala chai and that order was lost. Another waiter brought me the bill and I did not check it for the chai - which occasioned many minutes afterward of curious stares as the staff wondered why I wasn't leaving and I wondered how long it took to make a chai. After a bit I asked a server, who got pretty flustered, checked my bill, and in the end have me a free glass of chai so no complaints.",

    "text": "Really delicious Punjabi Indian food in London! On my one week trip to London this past week we looked for Indian food since we heard that it's your best bet at good food in London (otherwise notorious for having shitty food).The restaurant itself was packed on a Friday night around 8pm, but luckily there was barely any wait (10 min or so). I ordered the Lamb Madras since it was the only item under lamb labeled \"hot/spicy\". It was SUCH tender lamb - I was actually surprised but it may be the most tender lamb I've had at any Indian restaurant. The sauce was spicy enough, 7/10 on my spicy level scale (I love spicy food for reference). The curry flavor was really yummy, packed with just enough spices for that kick. My friend ordered one of their tandoori chicken dishes and I was equally surprised by how juicy the chicken pieces were (they didn't come with bone, so that's even more surprising). They poured a shot of (alcohol) on her chicken tandoori sizzling plate and lit it up with a match - the fire was HUGE so be wary of your hair! The mango lassi drink was perfect and not too sweet. The only letdown was the appetizer - we ordered the prawn puri and it came with SUCH tiny shrimp (def not prawn....). Skip that appetizer!Overall - food was delicious, portions a bit small for the price (approx 20 pounds per person) as we had no leftovers. I'm usually almost always left with leftovers at Indian restaurants in the States...If I'm back in London I'll be sure to visit Punjab again :)",

The food speaks for itself! The chicken tikka masala was so flavorful and the chicken was so tender. The samosas were crispy on the outside and jam packed with goodness inside - a bit on the spicy side, so be careful if you're not into spicy food. The lamb shami kebab was on point! The accompanying sauce was minty and citrusy all at once and really brought out the flavors of the lamb patties. I'll be dreaming of this place for years to come!",

The chicken tikka masala has moist, tender cuts of chicken in a delicious and not overly greasy curry sauce.

I wish I could tell you what me and my guest ordered, but we ordered a lamb curry dish and a chicken curry dish based on the suggestion of the waiter or manager. We had naan bread, and white rice, and the local beers Again, I wish I could say more about the dishes other than the spices were perfect, medium was just right, and the atmosphere was fantastic. It felt very much like a local, cozy place to eat for locals. I would highly recommend to anyone..",

He insisted that Punjab was the best place for us to go. \u00a0I was definitely overwhelmed by the menu. \u00a0It is quite extensive! \u00a0I had tried Indian food a few times before, but I am certainly no expert. \u00a0My friend and I decided to split an order of the Butter Chicken (it sounded simple for us beginners) with sides of Cheese Naan and white rice. \u00a0Our friend recommended the Chicken Tika Masala, but we decided to play it safe.It actually turns out that we should have listened to my friend. \u00a0Although the Butter Chicken was good, it was actually much richer and spicier than the Chicken Tika Masala that we tried! \u00a0The Chicken Tika Marsala was mild, unique and delicious. \u00a0I will definitely be ordering it during my next meal at an Indian restaurant.Our Butter Chicken WAS enjoyable. \u00a0It was very tender and went perfectly over our side of white rice. \u00a0However, my favorite part of the meal was the Cheese Naan. \u00a0I could have eaten a stack of it! \u00a0Naan is an oven-baked flatbread served with Indian food (I did not know this). \u00a0The Cheese Naan has a white cheese baked inside the flatbread. \u00a0It was AMAZING and I loved it. \u00a0I'm actually craving an order as I write about it.The restaurant was casual, but nice. \u00a0I loved the Indian decorations and bold colors. \u00a0The service was also wonderful. \u00a0The next time I am in London, I will be sure to stop at Punjab for some Chicken Tika Masala and endless orders of Cheese Naan.",

In fact my wife and I almost didn't eat here because when arriving and asking for a table for 2, the host barked \"go outside and wait til I see what I have\" which was a little off putting, since it was a cold December night and we had no idea how long we'd be expected to stand out there. We also arrived at the same moment as a drunken group of 8 who the same host basically told to hit the bricks as they couldn't be accommodated. \u00a0As we were walking away I heard him calling for the table of 2 so we scurried back and they seated us a few minutes later. The upstairs dining room was much quieter than the downstairs. At first it was eerily quiet but eventually they turned on some Indian music that improved the the atmosphere a bit. Whoever wrote the menu has a good sense of humor. I appreciated that when reading some of the descriptions. After 2 entrees, 2 naan breads, 2 drinks, and the service charge, the total came to \u00a344. Great food, unmemorable service, pricier than your typical takeout.

I wanted something that was classic and not to stuck up or fancy and just simply good. Punjab delivered. I had the lamb korma with plain rice and naan- the flavors blended together perfectly and were not overpowering. I tried some of the tikki masala as well and it was excellent! The place is small but comfortable and we were comfortably set with a party of 5. \u00a0I loved the windows in the front of the restaurant and if I came back I would ask to sit near the front simply to people watch. I've considered moving from Houston, Texas to London simply so I could eat here at least twice a week. It seems rash but I'm still thinking about it. Overall best Indian food EVER!",

My friend and I had the Cheese Naan, Chicken Karahi and Acharri Murgha. The chicken was succulent and the sauces/spices flavorful without being heavy. Good selection of wine+beers and prices quite fair for London. Where Punjab truly separates itself is in its service - Amrit and his staff go to extraordinary lengths to take care of their customers. My friend lost a family heirloom in the restaurant and Amrit and a few of his staff personally helped us search for an hour-plus after close to find the ring, and sure enough it turned up! I recommend Punjab to anyone valuing fantastic food+service in Covent Garden.",

I did prefer the garlic chicken over the butter chicken, but both were great, and the naan was perfect for sopping up all the delicious sauce. Mango lassis were nothing inventive but still delicious and refreshing. Punjab's staff was also super helpful--giving us recommendations on things to do before we returned to our apartment later that evening and even chasing us out the restaurant to make sure we were headed in the right direction.If you're looking for authentic and delicious Indian food, don't miss it! :)",

It isn't too spicy either if you regularly cannot handle heat. \u00a0To go with this, I actually preferred the spiced rice over the naan. I believe it's seasoned with cumin and maybe some turmeric. I am more of a rice than a bread person though. The only downside of this place is the service. They know they are the best so service isn't all too friendly and attentive. They also slap on an \"Optional\" service fee. We didn't bother asking them to remove it, considering how long it took to place our order and to get our bill.

I got a menu for people with allergies, and ordered a chickpea dish with a side of rice. It was delicious! They warned me that the food I ordered is spicy, but it was perfect. We had our own dishes with naan to share, it was a perfect meal! Definitely come here if you're looking for Indian food in London.",

That itself makes it a ***** material :)You must make a reservation before going. The place is small and there is always a crowd waiting outside. You can frequently spot a tall burly Indian guy there ... me :)The person who guides patrons to their tables is a little rude sometime (especially when you are late) ... but given how busy and stressed he seems to be running the place, i can forgive him.The food is fabulous ... everything i have tasted there till date is good. Not a bad dish at all. Be it the chicken tikka starters or the kaddu-puri or the main courses.Punjab claims that its \"granddad's kaali dal\" is their best product. Its good, but i don't find it special. On the other hand, i would strongly recommend the tandoori paratha.Another of its positives. Punjab makes the best mutton biryanis i have had in London, or anywhere out of India for that matter. Indian restaurants in London usually spoil the biryanis by making them too dry (an extra dish of bad curry that they serve alongside does not make up for it). Punjab is an exception.The prices are a little on the higher side than comparable Indian restaurants (you can easily spend \u00a325 or more person) ... but totally worth it.",

The channa masala and the korma dishes were particularly drool-worthy. The naan is also quite tasty (check out the description of the garlic naan on the menu - they advise you not to eat their \"extreme\" garlic naan if you have \"erotic activities\" planned for the night!)

    "text": "We came to this restaurant after reading Yelp reviews. Arrived at about 6:30pm, one party ahead of us. Despite seeing several open tables we were told to wait, and took about 20 minutes to seat the 3 of us. The ambience was good, and the food aroma was inviting. We ordered buttered chicken which consisted of two medium sized pieces of chicken that was covered with the yellow spiced curry, but dry on the inside. We also ordered the goat tandoori which came in 4 kebabs, well seasoned but very salty. Also ordered buttered naan and sweet naan, both just okay. The service was definitely a low light, had to ask for water 3 times, and they never came by to refill. The bill came quickly though, and surprised to find they already added tip. Overall not impressed with the food, bad service, definitely not recommended and would not come back.",

Even without reservations, we were quickly ushered to a table and food came our perfectly -- savory, flavorful, and delicious! We ordered the pumpkin on bread, butter chicken (savory as it should be , not sweet), methi gosht (might not be spelling this correctly!), bullet naan (garlic and chilis! Heaven!!), aloo paratha, and butter naan. This was enough for dinner and some leftovers for tomorrow :) Besides that, the owner and staff are wonderful -- friendly and good-natured.

I had Grandad's Kali Daal, and even though I'm not normally a vegetarian, I was blown away by this meal. It was rich, not overly creamy (most likely yogurt-based), and perfectly cooked. The lentils were firm to the bite but thoroughly stewed. The naan was the right balance of pliable, but crunchy. Even the plain basmati rice I ordered was perfectly cooked.The service was punctual, but as others have noted, it could have been friendlier. The waitstaff wasn't rude, just cold and non-interactive. I would have given Punjab 5-stars had the service been better. But everyone there was so aloof, I docked them a star just on that one aspect.The interior is intimate and cozy. Nothing mind-blowing but very relaxing.All-in-all, Punjab restaurant is well worth the visit if you're seeking a well-priced, authentic, delicious stop on your culinary tour of London.",

Food was very tasty, chicken succulent, sauces just right without relying on over spicing and naan supper fresh.

    "text": "3.5 stars.So Saturday around 7:45 pm for a table of 2 there was only about a 10 minute wait. My recommendation is to book in advance for sure no matter what party size you are because why not? The line can get quite long and it isn't entirely predictable, so might as well be safe.Shortly after we got in the line, it became quite long quite quickly. A group of about 10 behind us was told it would be a 1.5 - 2 hour wait.Now the people here are mostly fun and jovial. There are a couple of servers who were a bit cold and impatient, but generally speaking people are smiley and friendly. The expediter at the front who passes the dishes to the servers is super friendly. The food here is really interesting - you'll see things here that they don't have elsewhere and vice versa. I would recommend actually going with a Punjabi dish here instead of something you can get anywhere (like a generic tikka masala or korma). We went with the acharri murgha and chicken malai tikka.Acharri Murgha - an classic Punajbi pickle-style chicken, medium spiced, and a bit tangy. Now let me say a word about the \"pickle-style\" - the sauce is flavoured with pickles in the cooking process, but there are no actual pickles in it. The pickle taste is also certainly not overwhelming, which I was really afraid of. This was a delicious, unique, flavorful dish and I would highly recommend it. I haven't tasted much like it before and I would absolutely get it again.Chicken Malai Tikka - chicken breast marinated with cream, cheese, and yoghurt, cooked in the tandoori and served sizzling with onions on a skillet. This dish was just ok, but nothing special. I expected much more from the dish. The chicken was super soft, tender, and creamy, but there wasn't a lot of flavour and it wasn't interesting.The hariyali chicken tikka really caught my eye, but I was too afraid to try it because it's apparently a very very strong coriander taste (with some mint as well) and some of the servers seemed to think it could be overwhelming.We also got steamed rice and naan, which I wouldn't say was one of the better ones I've had.Overall though, I was very happy with the meal, the staff, and the acharri. I'd definitely recommend giving this place a try.",

Right around the corner from the hotel and pretty centralized to everything else (such as Covent Garden and Holborn) it is incredible. We had chicken tikka masala which was fantastic, garlic naan that was soft, crunchy and delicious, and another type of chicken coated in mint and coriander. It came out sizzling, warm and tender. Perfect. Why hadn't we come here earlier?Highly recommend this place for anyone local or anyone visiting the area. Oh and the service is outstanding. Attentive and patient. Gets the job done. A+",

The servers were nice, and the food was great. Definitely order the butter chicken (although our bowl only had two pieces of chicken). We ordered the garlic naan, despite the funny tip on the menu. The garlic isn't really as strong as the menu warns, so I wouldn't worry about not getting any action after the meal! I would definitely return!",

We had 3 waiters/servers for our table of two. The food came out speedy fast. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala and my girlfriend ordered Chicken Tandoori. We were both very pleased. It was very tasty. We also had an order of the garlic naan which was standard. The prices were reasonable (just under \u00a330 for two).

There are variations on the naan and the basmati rice is overpriced, but you can't argue with the well cooked curry. My acharri gosht was perfectly cooked and the lamb was tender. While my brain was telling me that cottage cheese did not belong in gravy, butter, and cream, the paneer makhani was delicious and tasted more like tofu. The prices were a bit high for what you get, but at least the food tasted good.",

To begin with, in 5 mins , the same waiter asked 3 times : are u ready to order . ( as if I am in his way if I don't ) And when I asked for recommendation and asking what the indian dishes were ( I was searching on my phone earlier ) , and then he fucking took my phone and then did some tapping ( hard!) and then satisfied himself with what he found as a \" bangai\" food pic and then threw my iPhone 6s on the table ! Basically he has used my phone without my permission and Hey ! Throwing it back ! That was raging !! And then when we ordered , me and my friend said one only even after he said it s too small for both of us, and we said no, and when he confirmed the order , he just was like : 2 naan yeh ? I was like ONE !!!!! And then he asked what we want to drink and we don't feel like ordering any beverages but just tap water . He shot this look of \" order so little !\" At us ( at this point , it is pretty subjective ) . Anyways . Got through the end ... And then once they quickly cleared the table , there stood the dessert menu and when we said no , next thing on table was the bill, even we didn't ask for it. We didn't touch the bill for like 2 mins cuz me and my mate were chatting . This staff interrupted and was like : everything alright ? There are people waiting outside . We were very upset by the service . Probably won't go again . \u00a0This kind of fast food restaurant is not what we look for and customer service still trumps commercialized food ! Even fast food allows u to sit for awhile. And besides , had better Indian food around the area .",

And not only that but when we got the bill, the rice was 3 pounds so that's about $5 USD for just white rice. We ordered two. If we had known, I would have gotten more naan instead. Some of the naan were cheaper than white rice.The service was ok. Nothing great.The place seemed pretty touristy. No one at the nearby tables were English.

A bit too spicy for my kids after growing accustomed to our favorite Indian in blandly spiced Germany. Easy to get to from Tube station nearby.",

I really enjoyed the butter chicken, it had flavor but I definitely wouldn't consider it \"spicy.\" I will admit that I don't have the most refined Indian pallette in the world but the chicken marsala sauce tasted much like the sauce in a can of SpaghettiOs if we're being honest. The service from the staff was excellent. They seated us immediately and made sure we were always looked after. The meal was relatively costly for what I expected, about \u00a335 for the two of us.",

    "text": "Some might erroneously call me unadventurous for never straying from my order of chicken tikka masala at an Indian restaurant. Others might correctly recognize that I simply wanted to honor \"a true British national dish\" (shout out to you, former British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook) in one of the world's most multicultural cities.Dishoom is definitely the more popular Indian restaurant in London, but I didn't want to risk having to wait for a table. Punjab fit the bill perfectly. We were promptly seated and ordered chicken tikka masala, butter chicken, garlic naan, and rice. The garlic naan was so good that it has now ruined all other kinds of naan for me. Both of our curry dishes included succulent, juicy chicken. While the butter chicken was extremely flavorful, I wish we would've gotten a vegetable dish instead because it started tasting a little repetitive. If you're torn between Punjab and the Dishoom in Covent Garden a few blocks from Leicester Square (even if you're already in line for Dishoom), don't hesitate to give Punjab a try. The decor here looks a bit traditional and outdated compared to Dishoom's trendy atmosphere, but you can't go wrong with the curry at Punjab.",

The lamb biryani was very good, chicken tikka masala was good too, less tasteful than I expected, curry lamb was tender and tasty. Decent quality and portion.

Walked in and we were warmly greeted by the team at the door and also saw there was a great variation of ethnicities as far as diners which is a good indication that this was going to be a great experience. One of the guys came over, took my friend's jacket and placed it on the chair - truly gentleman move right there and asked if we needed some suggestions for a great meal. We asked for time to review the menu, made our selections and anxiously anticipated our food to come. Out first, they bring you a gratuitous aperitif - a thin and crispy flatbread with four salsas/salads - mango puree, onion/tomato/cucumber diced salad, this delish apple/mint chutney mix and some type of spicy pickles I think (forgot to try that though). We ordered an app of ground lamb and lentils formed into patties and OMG - this is patty heaven! The rest of the meal consisted of saag paneer And chicken tika masala - all absolutely divine! My soul says too bad I dont live here but my waistline is grateful! Excellent job all around!",

Very easy location and excellent staff who were very attentive but laid back to let you eat as well. Kid friendly too!The pakora were crispy and wonderful. My husband had a chicken dish that came in a sizzling fajita like platter that was pretty awesome and I had the chole which was just enough spice and super flavourful. It wasn't spicy to cover up blandness but just enhanced all the ingredients. We overheard another couple talking about gluten-free options and they were being more than accommodating which is great to hear. Reasonably priced too, we defintely will consider visiting again next time we are in London.",

Our amazing appetizer was Kandu Puru, the pumpkin bread. Our courses were Acharri Murgha (chicken curry) and Methi Gosht (lamb curry). Both were exceptionally prepared, tender meats and truly delicious sauces. We accompanied it with cheers naan which was also delicious. My favorite of the dishes was the chicken curry.

The service was very good and the wait was not too long on a Saturday evening- maybe 15 minutes. Samosas were alright (I feel bitchy saying meh), and the prawn puri and king prawn bunha were also ok. They were slightly disappointing from flavour and temperature. Keep in mind that I've become snobbish when it comes to Indian food in London at this point. I did, however, love the cheesy naan. It's a very subtle light cheese inside the naan and adds a beautiful creamy and fluffiness. It's a nice Indian restaurant in a very good location but you can find much better (and much worse) elsewhere.",

    "text": "I knew while I was in London that I had to eat some Indian food. After spending a full day at Warner Brothers Studio we went to Yelp for suggestions. Punjab had the highest stars with the most reviews, most places had under 50. We arrived around 7:30-8p on a Monday night and the restaurant was fairly crowded. We put our names in and waited about 10 minutes before being seated. Our waiter was friendly and personable, he made suggestions that we gladly took. We ordered: \u00a0Tikka Masala, butter chicken, saag paneer, gobi aloo, and acharri gosht lamb, cheese naan and rice. We definitely ordered too much food. My friend also ordered samosas as an appetizer for herself. Samosas: my friend loved them, they were hearty and the pastry they were cooked in had just the right amount of flaky texture to it. She wasn't a fan of the mint chutney she ordered with them and I tasted it and was also underwhelmed. Tikka masala: delicious. The chicken was juicy and tender and the sauce was rich and creamy. I wish it had a little bit more spice Butter chicken: the sauce was AMAZING. I couldn't stop dipping the naan in it. It was the right amount of spice and so flavorful. The chicken also was cooked wonderfully and fell off the bone. Lamb dish: delicious. Flavorful and juicy. I only had a small amount of this but my friend was in love. Saag paneer: was good, not great. Would probably pass on this dish if I came again. Gobi aloo: my boyfriend loved it. I didn't try any. He said it was the best he's had. Cheese naan: cheese and bread are the perfect pairing. This didn't disappoint. The flavors of the food and the service definitely makes me want to visit this restaurant again if I'm ever in London. It's the oldest Indian food restaurant in the city!",

It's a bit of a tourist trap, but almost everything in central London is to some extent, so I can't fault it for that- plus I'm no local either.After years living in Singapore within a 10-minute walk to Little India for my weekly Indian fix, this was my first taste of classic British style Indian food. I had to try a chicken tikka... and it was ok. I've now been there, done that. Meh. The black dal (Grandad's dal) was ok. And so was the lamb korma. All around average. So far in London I preferred Dishoom more, however it is a much more modern restaurant. I opted to take the in-laws here, to Punjab, as I knew it was more traditional restaurant (quiet, good service). Not a bad place at all, but with all the Indian places in London, I'll try somewhere new next time for something more authentic, unusual or innovative.",

We checked out the map of the area and found Punjab was a quick walk from where we were and, since we were in the mood for Indian, it seemed a good choice. Let me say, I know nothing about Indian food and I have only ever had it twice in my life prior to this, but if I lived in London this would be a go-to, hands down. The food was absolutely delicious and largely sized, the staff actually provided a carafe of water for our table, the drinks were well priced and large, and the staff was friendly, too! I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and I wish I could find something this delicious close to home. My husband ordered one of their spicy dishes and it was definitely spicy (he tried denying this, but the color of his lips told the real story). We also had a flavored naan and the plain rice, both of which were delicious and helped stuff us. We also had no clue that this place was included in a Guy Fieri show, but luckily it wasn't super crowded when we went. Overall, go here. It's delicious, it's filling, it's just what you need if you're looking for Indian food in the Covent Garden neighborhood.",

One thing to note is the seating arrangement felt pretty cramped - separate tables were really close to each other, which made things a bit more uncomfortable.Since I'm not an expert on Indian food, I let my friends pick our dishes since we were going family style. I think we went with a Chicken Tikka Masala (apparently a classic), Acharri Murgha, Karahi Paneer, and another paneer dish that I've forgotten. For sides, we ordered 3 garlic naans and 3 butter naans. The food took a while to come out, but when it did it all came out at once. Maybe for that reason the dishes weren't as hot as I would've liked them to be, but it was still warm enough.I'm not the biggest fan of cheese, so the paneer dishes weren't my favorite. I did, however, enjoy the Chicken Tikka Masala! And the other chicken dish was alright, too. The garlic naan was pretty tasty, but it was a bit too oily for my liking. Overall, I thought the meal and experience were just ok - nothing special, but then again maybe that's just because I'm not a huge fan of Indian food to begin with.",

All dishes are pretty solid, from Lamb Korma, to Acharri Murgha, to Chicken Tikka Masala (just to name a few that I've tried). The Mango Lassi was good. But the mango juice was a bit watered down? I think I'm just used to a more nectar like consistency for mango juices. Special shoutout for the Chicken Madras though. The waiter warned me that it's very spicy and I didn't think too much of it. But seriously, never have I ever tasted such a spicy curry, let alone food. I was literally sweating buckets from this. My friends sampled my dish and felt the burn immediately. I think I felt it 1/3 of the way in. I wouldn't say it's a numbing kind of spicy, but more like a slow burn. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the dish. But the strange thing is, I ordered the Lamb Madras a few months later and it wasn't half as spicy as the Chicken Madras? I already ensured my waiter that I can handle my spices... But I guess you really have to emphasize that you want it SPICY SPICY. I also like how the waiters throw in freebies every once in a while. My Panjabi friend asked for a Panjab specific bread called bhature, but was told that it's not on the menu. Around 15 minutes later our waiter brought out a basket of bhature specially made for her, free of charge! There was another occasion where I got a plate of papadam accompanied with various chutneys and pickled vegetables, free of charge once again! How awesome is that?! Overall great food, fantastic service, and reasonable price. I don't think my expectations for curry will be the same after eating at Punjab. Highly recommend this place!",

Friendly staff with a great sense of humour.Super fast service and no reservations. You won't have to wait long to be seated.Trust me, you don't need to reserve here, just walk in anytime.You might not realise how big this place is until you actually get in and explore it yourself. There are multiple floors and no matter where you sit, you'll have someone around to serve you. They serve traditional Punjabi food and some non Punjabi dishes too. Unfortunately I was so hungry and seduced by the look of the dishes served in front of me that I forgot to take pictures of them, which I usually do to post to Yelp. And when I started having them, I was in trance, so wasn't aware of much going on. One thing I noticed is that this place is filled with tourists and foreigners. Well that explains it. This restaurant is more famous than many others, search the web for \"Oldest Punjabi restaurant in London\" and you'll know. I will be eating here many more times. They have a wide variety of things on the menu, Punjabi Chicken/Mutton dishes are fabulous, but so are the vegetarian ones, so I hope to try out everything on their menu in the coming few years. I so regret the time I spent in London, not knowing this place existed. Don't repeat my mistake.",

The place is very small and cramped, and the service was pretty poor. Even in the tiny place, the server didn't make eye contact and we had to flag him down several times. When the server did make his way to us, he was very bent on overselling dishes to us and had us over order, honestly. The food was very average. Other than the kaddu poori, which made me think about home (which was something we grew up eating), everything else was sub par. The naan/ roti was too hard and the Kadhai chicken was not great The daal was also very bland.I don't know if we came at an off time, but our experience was sub par and I won't recommend it/ come back again.",

    "text": "I'm not going to lie, British food proper isn't much to write home about, but they've been smart enough to bring the best that the Empire had to offer back to London, and Punjab is a case in point. We were there pretty early (maybe 6ish?) on a random Tuesday, and had no issues getting a table for two as walk-ins, but they were steadily busy so your mileage may vary. Service was proper; friendly enough and efficient, and both our beverages and our food came out remarkably quickly. Additionally, we had no issues getting the check when we were ready to depart, which is a change of pace from most of continental Europe.My colleague's Butter Chicken was excellent; flavorful and a touch spicy (or perhaps I've been eating bland German food for too long). Definitely a solid choice. However, we both agreed that the Pudina Ghosht (a mint lamb curry) was the real winner of the meal. I don't think I've ever had a mint curry before, and I'd order it again in a heartbeat. Spicy and packed with herbal flavors, but without the sometimes overpowering richness that comes from some of the more common curries (at least those that are common in the US). Absolutely fantastic!One tip: the meals don't generally come with rice or naan, so make sure to order a side of them if you want them!",

Very prompt and accommodating. We started with samosas with a great dipping sauce.We followed with the chicken tikka masala, mixed grill and garlic naan. I asked for the chicken tikka masala a touch under \"Indian spicy\" which is how I normally order it in the US (a 10 Indian spicy usually knocks me out haha!) Not sure if they assumed we couldn't handle their spice level because we are not Indian and from the US, but it was not spicy AT ALL. My boyfriends mixed grill was good, but he also requested a side of spicy tikka masala sauce and it was again not spicy at all. They quickly gave him a spicier sauce, madras, which was better, but still not nearly the spice we are used too.To be clear, the food at its core is good!! However, we have found at many different types of restaurants in London that the spice level is just not what we are used to in the US. If you are an American craving spice, would just recommend asking for a much higher spice level here and really most places in London.",

Every dish was excellent, perfect mild spice to it. Creamy Saag Paneer and Tikka Masala. All these dishes just went perfectly with each other. And what would Indian food be without Raita??

    "text": "Located in beautiful Covent Garden (aka the theatre district of London), Punjab remains true to its authenticity. Open since 1945, It's apparently the oldest North Indian restaurant in London. The decor inside is traditional with purple as it's predominant color. The seating is a bit cramped in here, as tables are quite close to each other. The food here is great. My family and I got the mango lassi, saag paneer, naan, tandoori chicken, lamb madras, and chicken madras. The mango lassi was creamy and fragrant. But, I still think it doesn't even compare to the mango lassi in Singapore, which was mind blowing. The saag paneer was less creamy compared to one I usually eat in Houston at Naseeb. But, I did appreciate the spinach flavor that's more predominant at Punjab. The tandoori chicken had a nice grilled flavor and was moist. It went well with their naan bread. Now, the best dish on their menu by far was their lamb or chicken madras. Strong curry flavor and spicy as hell! Thank goodness we had enough rice to calm the spice. I would definitely recommend eating this. I can't wait to come back to this restaurant whenever I visit London again. It would be a wonderful dinner choice before a theatre show close by. I'm sad I missed the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child play that was currently playing nearby when we were there.",

    "text": "I came here because of a recommendation from a friend in Los Angeles and thought my tastebuds were in for Nirvana. \u00a0The line out the door was a good sign, but sadly my hopes of finding Nirvana at Punjab was not so. I came here a couple times during my last trip to London hoping things would get better. \u00a0I did meet some nice people who shared a few of their dishes with me so I was able to taste more than I would have by myself - that's always nice! \u00a0There are some good things, but mostly I left with a poor taste in my mouth and bitterness in my heart. The service was consistently fair to middlen. Anytime someone comes to take your full order without suggesting appetizers or beverages it makes me feel like they want you in and out as fast as possible. Is this a fast-food joint? \u00a0No? \u00a0Then let me try to enjoy the experience you have to offer. I asked the server for suggestions since every chef has their specialty, but I didn't get any. \"Whatever you feel like\" doesn't sit well with me.On my second and third visits I ordered different appetizers. \u00a0Each were very hot, tasty, fresh and perfectly seasoned with dipping sauce that add the right amount of \"kick-ass\" to your tastebuds. \u00a0The stuffed eggplant didn't seem to be stuffed with much of anything (it was cut down the middle and roasted), but I could eat roasted eggplant any day of the week and be perfectly content. The chicken Korma was like pur\u00e9ed baby food without any of the flavor or spices you might expect. No cashews, raisins, or any other seasonings you'd normally latch onto to please your palate. \u00a0Such a disappointing dish. They wouldn't let me order it \"spicy.\" \u00a0I was also told that people have nut allergies, so I guess I can't have nuts at Punjab either! \u00a0I realize there are different styles of cooking, especially when it comes to south Asian cuisine, but I didn't enjoy the bland nature of this dish which I generally love and call \"my favorite\" at other restaurants. Here is what upset me the most and left bitterness in my heart: \u00a0I had already experienced different dishes throughout my stay in London at Punjab with a variety of meats, but on my last night I ordered a different chicken dish (my cardiologist would like this). \u00a0When I tasted the dish my tastebuds said \"baa baa baa\" and not \"cluck cluck cluck.\" \u00a0It was lamb, again. I love lamb so I ate it anyhow and didn't complain, but as I was leaving the restaurant one of the owners said, \"I saw that you ordered chicken, but I switched it to lamb because lamb is better.\" \u00a0I don't mind a prefix menu if that's what I'm ordering, but intentionally changing my order and NOT telling me is WRONG. If you want me to try something different, then give me a taste and don't force your opinions on me. \u00a0I was consistently asking the servers for suggestions and they wouldn't give me any! \u00a0I already had plenty of lamb at Punjab and wasn't in the mood for more, but I ate it, again. How would you feel if you ordered a cucumber sandwich and the chef said, \"I saw you ordered a cucumber sandwich, but what you really wanted was a BLT so I changed it...oh, and you're still paying me for it.\" \u00a0I'm generous with two stars.",

Don't expect modern interpretation of Indian food, fusion or anything like that - expect a typical British Indian restaurant, done just right.

I had the chicken tikka masala and my husband had the Achari Murgha. My dish was tender and flavorful, definitely stood out among the many tikka masalas I've had! \u00a0The Achari Murgha was spicy and full of flavor, a completely different set of flavor than either of us had tried before. Both dishes were excellent and were well complemented by the garlic naan. We were impressed by the setting, the great food but especially by the service and care taken by the staff.

I won't spoil it but if you read the descriptions you'll find it hard not to crack a smile or five.And the food, what most restaurants are famous for... I had the kadu-puri for starters (after the obligatory poppadoms of course!) and it was soooooo good. A light and slightly crispy pastry/batter filled with curried pumpkin yumminess.After that I had a try of three vegetable curries which were all cooked very well and had an abundance of flavour without being so hot that I couldn't enjoy them.The one thing that stood out as a negative, however, was that as a vegetarian, whilst there were a lot of options, I felt that a lot of them are what in a lot of other places you'd find as side dishes. I kind of felt like something was missing, like I'd missed the main course and gone straight for the extras. That's not to say it didn't taste great or that I left still feeling hungry, but when I go back I'll see if there's not something I can order with a bit more substance.Prices? We all had poppadoms, mains, rice, naan and alcohol and paid a little over \u00a320 per head. In other words, not cheap, but not bad, and certainly worth it.",

At 6 o'clock there were people waiting outside for the doors to open. At 6:15pm the restaurant was almost full. Patrons of Punjab clearly need their tandoori fix.The service is professional with many servers waiting to take your order, meaning you are never left waiting for something. As for the food, I am going to keep it simple. EXCELLENT! Whether you are here for a quick eat with friends or as a romantic couple, this Indian eatery has a touch of class you will surely enjoy.",

The wait staff was helpful and the portions were large. The food was fresh and hot and reasonably priced. Even given the fact that it was in a theatre district area in London! Covent Garden is a beautiful area and this place is worth making a special trip to- I ate a bit of Indian food while I was in England and this one was the best! Be sure to get their Nan and their chicken tikka masala. Amazing stuff!",

    "text": "We went on a working lunch here today. For a Tuesday it was surprisingly busy (I see Indian/Punjabi food as a night time meal really). We went based on Yelp reviews, obviously, and we weren't disappointed. It announces itself as the UK's Oldest North Indian Restaurant and the photos and articles around the room provide you with its history. The decor isn't anything to shout out about but it's simple and comfortable which I liked.The waiter was slightly abrupt but in a comical way. He provided us with the wifi password via the menu (butterchicken) and helped with the food recommendations - I'm glad he did! We started with popadoms, pretty standard, but the chutneys which accompanied them were unisual particularly the greeny grain looking one (not sure if the name - sorry) which was tangy yet delightful.We then shard the Samosa's - crispy not soggy pastry (which does happen) on the outside, and the inside was almost creamy, stuffed with meat and potatoes with fantastic flavours running through.Now to the dish I was prompted to try, the Archarri Margha, I truly enjoyed this! You could tell that the ingredients were fresh and that they take pride in their special dishes and you could really taste tang!It was first Punjabi food experience, it won't be my last!To note: the prices are really decent especially for a restaurant in Covent Garden.",

We were seated immediately upon arrival (party of 2), and the staff was very attentive and kind. The fried lentil and lamb appetizer is delicious, but be warned -- there isn't much of it. So don't order to split if you're hungry! Portion sizes of the entrees are larger than one might come to expect in London. Decor was interesting and cool -- one might call it slightly dated, but when the food is that good, who cares?

We moved around as people came and went (it was raining outside, duh, so couldn't wait there), after the time passed we were seated at a table upstairs. The restaurant is huge and it was packed. My hubby really wanted to try some stuff he doesn't see on menus in the US, and he did, I can't remember what it was that he ordered though (something very spicy), but he really liked it! We also ordered samosas, naan, chicken tikka masala, some veggies, and rice since it did not come with the meat dishes, weird. The food was good! The flavors were very authentic and tasty, the naan was delicious! The service was ok, I kept having to ask for water, which seems to be on par for London (I had to basically beg for refills everywhere!) but overall this place was pretty good!

My wife had the chicken tikka masala, and I had the lamb roganjosh. All simply fantastic. The following day, we trekked out to the famed Brick Lane for some more Indian food, but honestly, Punjab blows away the Indian food on Brick Lane.

    "text": "London is known as a mecca for delicious Indian food. You're more likely to find a place selling tikka masala than the traditional English fish and chips while visiting. Because of this, I knew I had to try some good Indian food when I went to London. I knew it would be the best Indian food I can get without actually being in India. While doing research about where to eat, my sister and I stumbled upon Punjab. Punjab is known as one of the best Indian restaurants London has to offer. On any given night, you will have to wait up to an hour to get seated. My sister and I arrived at a good time. A bit before 7pm, and with hardly any line. Since we were only a party of 2, we were seated in about 25 minutes. The restaurant is much larger than it looks on the outside. When you first walk in you think there is only one room for dining, but then you see that there is another room, and even more seating upstairs. My sister and I were directed to the upstairs seating. The ambiance of the restaurant is very homey. Punjab isn't trying to be fashionable, and it isn't trying to be the best in London. This is just some good Indian food without all the hoopla. When we sat down, we knew we wanted to get something to drink. After looking at the drinks menu we decided to get the India Grover's Sauvignon Blanc. We thought it would be interesting to try some Indian wine. The wine was wonderful and refreshing. When I came time to order appetizers, I knew I had to get samosas. I can't have an Indian meal without trying the samosas. The samosas offered at Punjab were some of the best I've had. We also split some garlic naan. I garlic naan was just as good as the samosas. For my meal I got the chicken tikka masala. Chicken tikka masala is my go to Indian dish, and it was renowned in London. I just had to get it. The chicken tikka masala was outstanding. I loved the tomato based sauce that the chicken comes in. My sister got the karahi paneer and thought it was great. There were no complaints from her about any of the dishes. The entire meal was absolutely perfection.The service was also really great. All the waiters and employees were very nice, and courteous. I also appreciate that we were only waiting outside for 25 minutes when it was very cold outside. My only issue with Punjab is that I don't live in London and I can't visit as often as I wish I could. Punjab is a restaurant I would recommend to people visiting London.",

I looked at reviews online and I found Punjab. Upon entering it looked pretty busy for a Wednesday night they have it set up with almost a fine dining appeal. We were seated right away, which is always a plus in my book. I ordered the Strongbow cider to drink, which I was told was London's signature cider but I had never tried it before. To eat I ordered the garlic naan, the dahl, and the chicken tikka masala. Everything came out pretty quickly and it was all very good and I devoured it down but the stand out for me was the garlic naan I think it was the best I ever had. The service was friendly and attentive. I'd recommend this place to every fellow Indian food lover to try out.",

When I got there the line was pretty big and I wasn't too sure how quickly it was going to move. I easily put in a takeaway order and my food was ready in 10 minutes. The owner of the establishment was incredibly nice and even threw a couple of jokes my way even though it seemed like a mad house inside. I wouldn't normally think of this, but this place really splurges on the takeaway packaging. The containers were sealed really well and the bag was sturdy and leakproof, in case the containers didn't work. The only reason why I mention this is because this made it really easy to go through the Underground on a Saturday night without getting curry all over the place.I ordered the Kadu Sabji-their signature pumpkin curry (because I'm American and Americans love all things pumpkin this time of year), plain rice, and garlic naan. The food was PERFECTION. The curry was nicely spiced and had whole chunks of pumpkin in it that were perfectly tender. The garlic naan was also something to write home about. Very soft and chewy. Though, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone expecting to get a kiss afterwards; I suppose unless you both eat it then it cancels out. The meal is definitely enough for 2, which means I have some left over to enjoy tomorrow!Go here, seriously.",

The first spot, which I won't name, was more of an fusion restaurant with a limited menu. I knew it wasn't what I wanted because it didn't even smell like an Indian restaurant. Where was the aroma from the spices??? Fortunately, was able to convince my coworkers to look for another restaurant when we came across Punjab. I knew we were in the right spot the moment we walked in the door. We didn't order anything out the ordinary. We shared some chicken masala, Korma chicken, the chickpea dish (I don't believe it was called chana masala here), aloo gobi, rice and garlic naan. Everything was delicious and flavorful!!! One of my coworkers had dietary restrictions so we requested to speak to the manager. He was very attentive and accommodating in fulfilling his needs. \u00a0We ordered a bottle of Indian red wine called India Grover's LA Reserve. \u00a0It was excellent!! My coworkers told me they were glad I suggested finding another restaurant. I'd definitely go back and highly recommend the Punjab restaurant if you're looking for great \u00a0Indian food.",

    "text": "The wifi password is \"butterchicken\" - how awesome is that - I had to laugh a little when the waiter told meThat said - in hindsight maybe I should have ordered that - can't go wrong with butter or chicken. The chicken tikka masala however was excellent so either or I'm sure both are good. I'll be honest - I found this spot after getting an hour and 45 minute wait at Dishoom - no thanks, nothing is worth almost a 2 hour wait. I found Punjab which is just a few streets down and I'm glad I did. No wait at all and seemingly more authentic. Of course I had to get the chicken tikka masala - the chicken was some of the best I've had at an Indian restaurant - super moist and tender - excellent. The curry base was great as well - it was a little on the lighter side - was hoping for more spices and robust flavor. It wasn't on the menu but I got mixed vegetables in a tomato based curry which was also very good. The dishes don't come with rice or naan so I ordered a white rice and garlic naan - the rice was just plain rice, should have ordered the one with the seeds. The garlic naan was good but not as good as the bullet naan which I added later on because of the pictures. It's not as spicy as you would think (bullet naan). The samosa was delicious - crunchy outside and soft pillowy potato mash inside.  I also got a masala chai tea - very good and spicy. One of the better meals I've had in London - great Punjab food! Portions are good, prices are on par for the city - total came out to about \u00a343 for 2 ppl - appetizers, main courses, drinks.",

My husbands butter chicken was a little bit dry but he said the flavor was bold and spicy, just the way he expected it.

The food was delicious, staff was friendly and helpful. We had ordered butter chicken, tandoori chicken and chicken tikka. No food was left! I would recommend making a reservation, we were lucky at 6 to get a table. Leaving though we saw the line out the door and along the restaurant! We met briefly with the owner who was extremely generous, he is part of the fourth generation running this restaurant. I know my next trip to London I will be making an other appearance!

Acharri and karahi dishes are also really good here.I get the feeling this place tones down the spiciness, so if you're a regular Indian eater and like spicy, make sure to ask staff to bump it up a bit. For example, the biryani dishes are not nearly spicy enough in their \"standard\" forms. Same with the jalfrezi - the basic flavor is very good, but could definitely use a bump up on the spiciness. That said, once you request spicy, it really does get spicy!Also, one of the better gajar halwa I've had. If you're a fan, make sure you save room.

Between the moments I stepped in the restaurant to the moment I stepped out, each interaction with the staff felt very impersonal and unfriendly.

He just took the card, printed out a receipt, let me sign it, and walked away. Not a single eye contact. Wow. On top of all that, I'm required to give a \"10 percent optional service\" fee.PRICE:My total amounted to 14.25 GBP for Butter Chicken with rice. That's about $23.63 USD for those living in the states. People say that this place is cheap but I think it's expensive. I have been to other Indian restaurants where my total is about 11 GBP for the same or more portion of food. FOOD:I ordered the Butter Chicken and rice. The Butter Chicken included two pieces of chicken still on the bone. The gravy was good and had a slight spiciness to it. It goes well with rice or naan (not included in the price).

    "text": "I recently spent several days in London and wanted to eat some great Indian Food. \u00a0Looking at Yelp, Punjab seemed to be among the best so we decided to give it a try. \u00a0I won't say it's the worst Indian food I've ever eaten. \u00a0No, it's truly mediocre. \u00a0Dry, flavorless naan, poor quality rice, bland dal... everything you'd expect from a mediocre Indian restaurant. \u00a0I hope those who thought this was the \"Best freaking Indian food\" get a chance to eat at better places. \u00a0They can start a few blocks away, at Dishoon (it's not the best Indian food I've had, but definitely better).What makes Punjab one star, though, is the painfully strong odor of industrial strength soap that permeated ever nook and cranny of the place. \u00a0And after sitting in that horrid stench for an hour, it also permeated every nook and cranny of my skin and clothes. \u00a0The crazy thing is that this soapy smell seems to be the result of some towels that they give you at the end of the dinner, so you can clean your hands. \u00a0Or maybe, so you can get a chemical peel. \u00a0Either way, it was ridiculous and it totally ruined any chance we might have had to enjoy our meal.There are many more Indian restaurants in London. \u00a0Give some of them a try instead of this place.",

    "text": "After attempting to make a trip to Little India, we made a quick decision to get back on the tube after our mission had failed (the area didn't look safe for women to walk around at night), so we re-routed and decided to go to Punjab which was our 2nd choice after reading reviews on Yelp. I'm glad that we did! We really enjoyed this quaint restaurant. Our friends raved about the Indian food in London, so eating at an Indian restaurant in London was a must on our to-eat list.{ORDER}* Chicken Tandoori - the best chicken tandoori! The meat literally melted in your mouth, it was oh-so-soft!* Butter Naan - after trying the regular naan, we decided to get the butter naan after seeing the table next to us ordering multiple baskets. We loved it! The butter made a huge difference and made the naan very moist.{DON'T ORDER}* Acharri Murgha Chicken Curry - we weren't impressed with the flavors and the pickled, tangy flavored was unexpected and ruined it for me.* Garlic Naan - too dry* None of their desserts - the wanna-be carrot cake came out super hot and did not resemble anything like American carrot cake. It felt like eating mushy carrots. The other dessert, not sure what it was called but it was in a white liquid form was a huge disaster. {ENVIRONMENT}* Great service* Quaint, clean restaurant* Located in Convent Garden (safe area, lots of retails)Punjab is UK's oldest Indian restaurant. That tells you something. They're doing something right!",

Not really sure how that happened, but we loved walking around, it's such a funky and fun area. Finally we found it and were greeted by such a nice gentleman who kept joking around with my boyfriend and I. From the instant the door opened you could smell a variety of divine spices and we knew that this place was going to be great.We ordered chicken tikka massala, mixed chicken tandoori, a lamb curry I can't remember the name, plain naan, garlic naan, and white wine. SO GOOD! Will definitely be going back again. Great charm with good service and amazing food. Can't really get much better than that. It was a little pricier than expected but definitely worth it. Get there sooner than later or you'll be waiting outside because this place is so popular! I found the reviews here on yelp to be very helpful so thank you to you all who have enjoyed it and GO FOR IT for those of you who haven't!",

    "text": "UK's oldest North Indian restaurant serves perhaps the oldest and driest Tandoori meat. I must say to the 4 of us visiting this restaurant this came as a shock as it has gotten tons of high marks. The seehk kebab was as dried as the chilly used in it, the Boti kebab was chewy as an old dried leather belt and the Tandoori chicken bland. Chicken tikka on the tandoori menu was the only piece of meat that was somewhat up to the standard. In general the tandoori menu felt not tender nor marinated long enough. Butter chicken or Acharri gosht are the items to go for, but then again they are no better than much less exclusive and less up-scaled Indian restaurants in London. The portions, and we are not Americans, were too small for the price asked. Basmati rice and nan are good but nowhere as good as the prices indicate \u00a0nor are they any better than other Indian restaurants. The service is okay but deceiving, they do love to accommodate but they also love to sell and perhaps the worst I seen in London happened here when spring water bottle could not be opened at the table because it was \"slippery\" but conveniently \u00a0was replaced in the bar with another bottle which had already been opened. This is one of the oldest tricks in the book and at these prices and with this reputation \u00a0it shouldn't take place here. For a party of four and only 2 bottle of beers being the only alcoholic beverages served the sum of 114\u00a3 is much more well spend somewhere ells than Punjab.",

The entire meal they hovered around- not allowing us to enjoy our food or have peaceful conversation and after giving us our bill, they asked if we were done paying three times within two or three minutes of dropping it off.

    "text": "Riiight, I'm not sure where all these four and five star reviews are coming from. I'm a huge fan of good Indian food but this was only alright, average really. Maybe I was a little annoyed because we all ordered nan but only half of us actually got any. But there was an over-abundance of rice. I got a half a piece of plain nan and believe me, that is not enough. My veggie korma was only really korma inspired and lacked a depth of flavour. The service was far from spectacular \u00a0especially since our bill came to over \u00a320 more than it should have been and we all paid a good bit extra to make up for it. Sorry Punjab, this was a fail for me.",

    "text": "The best Butter Chicken in London! I always order this dish when I go there - perfectly spiced and the chicken is roasted, just the way it should be. It must be eaten with butter naan. Tried a Methi Gosht, but it wasn't that good. 4-stars just for the Butter Chicken.Atmosphere could be much better - they've crammed too many tables into the place, but they do make up for it by seating 2 people at a table for 4. Price - 20 Pounds/person.",

This has to be one of the most supurb places to eat in the area, and that's saying something...There was a queue actually outside the door from 5.30pm waiting for them to open and I can see why. The selection of dishes is what you'd expect with a few house specials thrown in the mix. A a new meat eater I tried a bit of everything and it was yummy, I actually had to move my plate away from me to stop myself from eating until I was sick - yup I'm a glutton! Deal with it!",

    "text": "Mmm... \u00a0pretty yum. \u00a0There were lots of us at the restaurant and I felt like they were quite accommodating and patient with our table.On Lizzie's recommendation I went for the fall off the bone butter chicken which was yummy- tangy and spicy and extremely dippable- in fact we ended up using uneaten bits of naan off other people's plate to mop our sauce. \u00a0The perswari naan was sweet but not too sweet, though I like mine with fruit in it, so slightly disappointed it was only sweeterned nuts.The only thing is they gave us bottled water instead of tap (as we requested) and that the poor server's arm was too short to reach over the other side of the table. \u00a0I think Tayyabs is still much better, despite the lack of service and infinitely cheaper too. \u00a0So there you go. \u00a0Punjab, I will probably be back if looking for curry in town, but I'd rather make the trip and go east.",

I eat at a bunch of different Indian places near my home base of San Francisco, and while several of them are quite excellent, what made this stand out was the texture of the chicken and the combination of a tomato-ey savory element that was, just yum. I will be back next time, and every time, that I am in London.",

    "text": "Dinner for one. Service was quick and efficient (rather than warm and welcoming) but got a table straight away. Starter of Pumpkin Curry Puri was fine without being worth a special mention, Main course of 'Grandad's black lentil dhal' was OK, but (for my taste) a bit runny as a main; I'd have it again as a side. Rice, chapatti and a pint of Cobra gave a bill just over \u00a320. This included a 10% service charge of \u00a31.87. If they'd left it off, I'd have left a bigger tip.Turnover was fast: business is obviously good. Overall OK, but a bit wham-bam-thank you ma'am.Go for a quick bite to eat rather than a night out or you'll be in bed for 10.",

    "text": "I suppose I should start this by saying that I'm not a fan of curry or indian food..............................With that, I hear immigration calling...they want their visa back.But seriously, I went with a group of friends hoping that the light would shine down and I would fall magically in love with all things Indian, and live a happy life satisfying late night cravings with poppadoms and tikka masala to my heart's content.Well, that didn't happen. Punjab put up a good try though. There was nothing to complain about, the service was excellent, the food was good. i had chicken korma and the portion was large for the price, and tasted good. My friends all enjoyed their courses and alcohol was reasonable for being in downtown London.The inside had some interesting colour schemes going on, and really wasn't a fan of the mustard yellow. I'd say give it a try, but don't expect his holiness, the Lord of Naan to shine down on you after your done.",

The paneer cheese in the dish was chewy and didn't have much flavor. We also ordered Chicken Tikka Masala which was tangy and decent tasting but didn't best some of the ones I've had before. The naan was good. Rice was decent but not great. We also had two types of pappadum and we prefer the masala pappadum to the plain. The chutneys and spices were not very flavorful. Nothing was really spicy. I ordered Rasmalai for dessert. It was good, milky and rich.",
