Literally the day after I moved here I was craving Indian. Fortunately, while out with a client, he suggested Indian food and one of the other agency guys knew of this place. We walked in, were seated immediately, and had wonderful service. We all order wine and a bunch of food. There was about 7 dishes for the four of us and it was just the right amount of food. Not sure what dish was my favorite. The goa was great, the lamb was done so well. I think the only not liked dish was the duck. Not much kick to it and not nearly as good as everything else. This will remain one of my go back to places! Absolutely amazing food and service here.",

They tried to help me with explaining: THE HAND FLIPPED UP - \"I don't need instructions to know how to rock\" When I cracked the menu open, I knew what to get, I've seen it all before countless times..I ordered, all at once: 6 beers (Cobra), Papadum, Paapdi Chaat, Panni poori, Onion Bhajhi, Chicken Tikka Masala (Hot & Spicy), Chicken Vindaloo (Hot as hell), Garlic Naan, Kulfi, Masala chai.I watched as others in the restaurant were licking napkins as if the food was too hot. But to me this stuff 'burned smoothly.' The stuff is really really terrific. But if you order the dishes on the spicy side, they come that way.I saw a few folks ordering wine, I was amazed, the flavors here utterly destroy wine, grab a Cobra, because you'll need a lot of washing down fluid.Everything exceeded my expectations except possibly the Onion Bhaji. I would come here over and over again, and the best part of it is, is right across the street is a wicked Fuller's Pub - the Victoria. I went and drank more tapped pints than I remember at this point.Rarely does food reach highs like this. Maybe I went on a \"good day\" and was lucky, but I don't think so. I think this place is a home run. Go there.",

After reading all the reviews I was very excited to head on over and try this place out. It was a perfect night out and was able to snag a table outside. The smell of the food from the kitchen was getting my hopes up. Unfortunately, the service was extremely slow. I finally got to place my order and asked for the chicken tikka masala, an order of naan and a coke. It took so long for my food to come out, I began to wonder if the chef was in the back running after the chicken trying to catch it for my meal. When my food finally came out, it looked delicious. As I took the 1st couple of bites I was little disappointed in the lack of flavor that existed in this dish. It was a little too on the bland side for me. Once I finished eating and they had cleared my plate I had another long wait after asking 2 of the waiters for my bill. In my opinion, this place is mediocre at best.",

I can't stop in London without seeking out some Indian food.Noorhajan is convenient to Paddington, and while a bit on the upscale side (white tablecloths and such), it is excellent and just enough off the main thoroughfares to avoid the tourist crowds. Well, except this tourist. But I was with a local, so I don't count, right?They have a great selection of curry dishes, and were very good about adjusting the level of spiciness to suit. When the weather is decent, there's a nice outdoor seating area right in front of the restaurant. It's quiet except for the occasional truck (I mean, \"lorry\") or motorcycle going by.They could improve the beer and wine selection - especially the wine. There are some standard wines on the list, but little I'd pair with curry. One of these days, more Indian restaurants will figure that out.I did think it was on the expensive side for Indian food - dinner for two with one large beer, bread, rice and a starter was about 65 pounds. Maybe I'm just spoiled by cheap hole-in-the-wall places in California, where the same is often 50 to 75% less. Or the US is just a third-world country now.",

We came across it en route to our hotel and it was our favorite and most memorable restaurant that we visited during the entire trip.We ordered vegetable samosas, chicken tikka, garlic naan, basmati rice, and chicken tikka masala. The vegetable samosa dish (comes with two samosas) came very quickly and tasted great - very mild but the light spice was enough. After eating our entrees, my mom said that the chicken tikka was delicious. I ordered the chicken tikka masala and ate every last bite. The sauce was definitely flavorful (on the tikka masala) and had some spice to it, but people who are afraid to order it because they don't like their food too spicy should not worry - it was not overbearingly spicy by any means. The garlic naan was equally tasty and it was a perfect addition to my tikka masala. After I had finished eating the chicken, I ate the remaining naan with any leftover sauce from the chicken. Delicious.If I come back to London someday, I will definitely want to return to the restaurant! Service was great and the restaurant seemed to always be busy when my mom and I passed. Good, authentic Indian food - hopefully, we'll be back! Highly recommend.",

Of course your Mom's cooking will always be #1, but your aunts is a close 2nd. ALMOST tied!I loved the flavor of the curry. CA has very red tomato based curry and here it was more on the yellow side and had wonderful aromas and flavors I could not distinguish. The papadom was also very different and did not have a poppy seed cracker consistency like ours. Very puffy/light instead. The chutneys were AMAZING. Better than our jam like chutneys here in CA.

Ambiance: Not a large place, and we were the only ones enjoying lunch the day before NYE. Super clean, even the bathrooms, which is a difficult thing to find in an Indian restaurant.Food: Everything was delicious.-- Samosas: My 9-year-old ate 2 of these and couldn't stop saying how much she liked them. I didn't get to try them (she doesn't share well).-- Spinach Kabob: Not sure exactly what this appetizer was called, it was mix between a pakora and a kabob, made of spinach and fried. SO unhealthy but SO good.-- Chicken Tikka - My husband said it was excellent (I don't eat chicken).-- Tarka Dal - Excellent.-- Dried Mixed Vegetable - Not greasy and quite tasty.-- Plain Rice - It was rice, what can I say?-- Naan / Tandoor Roti / Aloo Paratha - We went a bit crazy on the carbs but they were all quite good. Definitely recommend all of these.Bottom Line: We'll definitely return if we're in the area. Noorjahan was a hit!",

I made her go back two nights later. My favorite thing at Indian restaurants is bhindi. This place does it better than any other I've ever been to. They do it as a side dish, so I had it with delicious samosas and an awesome mango lassi. I was full. The second time we went, my colleague suggested we split a shrimp appetizer. I can't remember what it's called. Just get it. It was so awesome, but filling. After that appetizer, it was hard to finish the rest of my meal, but I tried my best. As silly as it sounds, I would have been happy to eat here every day. If you're visiting from a tube stop, get off at Paddington Station, go through the Hilton Paddington and out their front doors onto the street. Walk straight ahead of you for about four blocks. It's an easy walk from the station or the Hilton Paddington.",

During my recent week in London I returned there several times and was able to sample a number of dishes. All were delightful. The little corner restaurant is cozy inside with a very competent wait staff. But it is the food that drew me back. Everything I sampled was delicious.Their nan, which has been mentioned in prior reviews, could be the best I have ever tasted. A lamb appetizer folded into a puri 'pancake' could have been a meal in itself. It was a winner. Among the entr\u00e9e dishes, I especially liked the chicken tikka, the lamb curry and their signature chicken dish. The curries come in three grades of heat. I ordered the 'Madras' which was described as 'hot', but I detected little if any heat. Next time I would go with the 'vindaloo' which is the next step up and described as 'very hot'. Their butter chicken was quite flavorful but had a subtle sweetness that I had a mixed reaction to. At between \u00a39-13 a dish, the food quality surpasses many of its more expensive London competitors.",

Don't let the pictures of the dishes disguise you - it pretty much looks like your average curry or tandoori you can get anywhere else, but the quality makes all the difference! The lamb chops, the chicken and the kebab of the mixed starter are juicy and delicious, the naan bread is of unmatched quality and the rice smells wonderful. The curries are just like they should be - full of flavor, and spicy. This was definitely not my last visit, as there a lot more things to discover on the menu, which are impossible to cover in just one go!A clear and very well deserved five stars rating.",

We asked a couple questions about the menu. \u00a0I asked if they had lamb korma. It wasn't on the menu but he said they could still make it. \u00a0Score!!! He also told me about different rice options to go with the curry that I hadn't seen on the menu.We ended up ordering a lamb seekh kebab appetizer, garlic naan, lamb korma with coconut rice, panir makhani and plain rice. \u00a0Yes this was for two people and somehow we did eat almost all of it!The seekh kebab's were absolutely wonderful. \u00a0They were full of flavor and then came with this herb sauce that made it even better. \u00a0I could eat those once a week easily! \u00a0The garlic naan was very good. \u00a0It has a good amount of garlic and coriander which is my favorite part. \u00a0The bread was also nice a slightly fluffy. \u00a0The lamb korma was not like I get in the states. \u00a0It was a little sweet with no heat. \u00a0I actually liked it. \u00a0It was different but very good. \u00a0The lamb was very tender and the sauce had a wonderful flavor and consistency. The coconut rice was amazing! I could eat it on a regular basis, it honestly didn't even need the curry but it just added something even more special to the curry and I really enjoyed it!My sister seemed to like her panir makhani and rice.The meal was well priced, about on par with other Indian restaurants. The service was great and at the end we got this very yummy little piece of chocolate.Great service, great food, nice sidewalk restaurant. Seriously a great meal. \u00a0I would easily recommend and if I lived anywhere in the vicinity I would be there on a regular basis!",

The guy is already rude from the start and becomes even more so after I order the remaining food. Looking at me if I was cheap etc... Then two white British guys come in and sit down. This time he immediately \u00a0serves them and gives them papaddum for free without them asking. When I had already ordered it. They came in 10 minutes after I did and were served food and drinks 5 minutes before I was even given a glass of water. Which I had to ask for. \u00a0Service of this one guy was terrible and will never have me come back.Normally I would never write anything bad, but this experience \u00a0was just terrible overall. Even as I was asking for the bill eating he started clearing the food while I was eating from one of the dishes... I also couldn't finish any of the food dishes 1) because \u00a0there was too much I had t ok order to hit the minimum \u00a0and 2) it wasnt appetizing",

This little gem is in our neighborhood. We went just after 6p when it opened for dinner. We had wanted to do take-away, but the line was constantly busy so we went over. The place filled up fast with a good mix of tourists and locals. The service is friendly but formal. It may seem a little slow to Americans, as we are used to being rushed out of restaurants. There are white linen tablecloths, nice dinnerware and flatware. The menu is not as large as most Indian places in the States, but it had everything I knew plus a new dish to me, Biriyani. It's vegetables or meat mixed with rice and spices, fried in ghee, and served with vegetable curry. Scrumptious! For dessert I had a luscious, tart lemon sorbet, served in its own frozen lemon rind. I'm so sorry I'll only be here one more night, but I'll be there promptly at 6p again tomorrow evening.",

NoorJahan II offers up familiar dishes (sizzling tandoori plates, chicken tikka masala, a nice selection of chicken, lamb, and veggie curries) prepared with care.While vindaloo (and phal) were tempting, I went with something milder: rogan josh with a side of Peshawari naan and a bottle of Cobra (a smooth Indian lager).That rogan josh was among the best I'd ever had: the lamb was fork tender, bathed in a richly spiced tomato curry. The naan, topped with toasted sesame seeds and filled with nuts and raisins, sopped up lingering curry.The waitstaff can be persistent in trying to upsell you, but it's a great meal in the end",

They acted very unwillingly to serve us lemon water in the jug. They never refill the water but keep coming to pour the beer from the bottle for my husband as they probably hope he finishes ASAP and get another bottle. We ordered Butter Chicken and Chef Special Chicken, both are very small in proton. All the severs look grumpy and didn't seem to want to interact with you. So we just guessed what might be good from the menu without getting recommendations. It turns out both taste very similar, butter chicken being creamier and sweeter. Toward the end getting the bill, they have the guts to have the gratuity prompt screen option. Of course when it's presented in front of you, it's kinda awkward not to give anything. So we paid 10% very unwillingly just like how they are reactant to provide some decent service.",

After getting off an 11 hour flight and taking the Heathrow Express to our hotel near Paddington station, we were looking for a quick bite nearby before going to sleep. My bf and I had originally intended to check out a pub that was across the street, but it was packed and we were too hungry and tired to wait around. The restaurant was probably more than half empty so a lot of the staff was just standing around. We ordered 2 Cobra beers to start off the meal. Wow.. the beer was SO SMOOTH. The bottle had the words \"impossibly smooth\" written on it so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.. but I still was. It was the smoothest beer I've ever had and it might be one of my favorite brands of beer ever now. I ordered the chicken tikka masala with garlic naan and basmati rice, and my bf ordered a lamb dish (I forgot the name lol). The staff was nice enough to split up the rice onto two plates for us and also plated our food on top of the rice. The rice was amazing.. buttery and delicious. The sauce for my chicken tikka masala was bombbbbb and the chunks of chicken were cooked well. I only had one bite of my bfs lamb dish since I'm not a fan of lamb, but I remember it being good as well. I was very impressed with my meal, especially since we were not planning to come here. This is a very solid place to go near Paddington station if you are craving Indian food!",

    "text": "Visited last night having seen some very positive reviews online (on other sites sshh!). Apparently this place is regarded as one of the best Indian restaurants in London so did it live up to its reputation..? Interior is contemporary and more upmarket that your typical curry house. Prices are also slightly higher, ranging from \u00a37.50 to \u00a314 for a main dish without rice/naan. 'Optional' 10% service charge is also added to the bill. One small quibble - like most Indian menus, it says that you can ask for a dish not listed on the menu and they'll always do their best to make it. There are only 4 vegetarian main dishes on the menu, so my partner asked for paneer jalfrezi. Surely not that weird? It was met with a stern 'no' and look of exasperation from the waiter. But he did agree on veg jalfrezi, thankfully. The food certainly doesn't disappoint - it's nicely prepared and possibly more subtly spiced than usual. There's not much room on the tables to the waiters serve everything onto your plate with great diligence to make sure you get all the nice sauce. The restaurant is clearly very busy and popular, and maximum tables have been squeezed into a fairly small area. This makes it feel a little cramped and hectic, but the food seems to arrive within minutes of ordering so ideal if you are grabbing a quick dinner before moving on somewhere else.",

    "text": "based on the feedback from yelp and proximity to my hotel, I gave this a try. \u00a0 I wanted to see what all the talk of great indian food in London was about. \u00a0 I arrived at 1pm on a Monday (Bank Holiday) and I was the only person in the restaurant. \u00a0 That threw me off a bit, but no big deal. \u00a0The service was kind and menu was filled with standard indian fare.I was quite surprised when I learned that most of the items did not include either rice or naan. \u00a0\u00a310.5 for Chicken Tikki Masala and I have to order rice (\u00a32.5/$4) and/or naan (\u00a32.6/$4.25) separately. \u00a0ok, london is expensive. \u00a0Looking back, and one $24 lunch behind me, I felt that the CTM was pretty good. \u00a0 The spices gave it a sweet flavor, not hot spicy at all, which is what I'm more accustomed to. \u00a0 Was it great? no. \u00a0Pretty good? \u00a0yes. \u00a0 If those were the same prices for the evening meal, I can see that it could be worth it. \u00a0I give it a solid 3 stars, maybe 3.5, but think it is in the 3 \u00a3 range instead of the published 2 \u00a3 rating.",

    "text": "So far, this is the best Indian I've had in London. My fianc\u00e9 walked to pick up take away and the service was great. He got a drink on the house while he waited. The food itself was excellent, and definitely much better than any Indian I've ever had back in the States. We got garlic naan, samosas, chicken tikka masala, and chana masala. The garlic naan and chicken tikka masala are the best I've EVER had. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "This place really got off on the wrong foot with me with indifferent and disrespectful initial service. Eventually, the service improved as the headcount increased and the general manager arrived.My first reaction was surprise at the simple, traditional menu, but that was just my ignorance. The food knocked my socks off. The nan was crispy and chewy at the same time, and the chicken starter was fantastic. Everything was perfectly spiced with the most wonderful flavors and after-burn. Each dish was fresh and distinct tasting. The pistachio kulfi was decent and well prepared, but compared to the preceding meal it was just 'ok'.I can't wait to go back here on my next trip to London.",

    "text": "Indian food is supposed to \"good\" in London, right? \u00a0Coming from Silicon Valley with a large Indian population, I was expecting some culinary competition. \u00a0Unfortunately our meal, despite reviews, did not live up to expectations. \u00a0We had ordered the butter chicken and the fish curry, but everything was disturbingly sweet. \u00a0The chicken was overcooked and chewy. The rest of the dishes - okra, rice and naan were fine, nothing extraordinary. \u00a0Lastly, the service left little to be desired. \u00a0The staff seemed flustered when they saw us walking in the door with our 3 year old son and ushered us to the downstairs part of the restaurant. \u00a0Despite the downstairs being completely unoccupied, our waiter still seemed annoyed that a child was present and was happily talking about seeing Big Ben that day. \u00a010 minutes later, I saw our waiter grinning as he seated a British couple and I had to do a double take. \u00a0Sorry Noorjahan, but -1.5 point for the food and -1.5 for the service if you are dining with a child.",
