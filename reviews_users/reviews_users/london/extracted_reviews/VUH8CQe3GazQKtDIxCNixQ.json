Ordering a bottle of wine for under 50 USD took about thirty minutes and four intermediaries, but I guess it got done and was very nice. The food was meh but the presentation was very nice. I wouldn't dine here again, but it was okay. The prices were absurd but I try not to think about that...I will say one thing though: don't eat the bread. They put it out there without telling you they're going to charge you for it (a tactic I recognize is common in Europe but one that I'm a little annoyed with) but it's actually quite disgusting. Seriously... Pillsbury makes better rolls than the ones they gave us...",

    "text": "As I was in the area for Quidam at the Royal Albert Hall, I decided to pop into this upmarket Spanish tapas restaurant which had been on my radar for awhile. It's part of a collection of Spanish restaurants in the Chelsea area - Tendido Nero, which does paella, is just across the road.I do like tapas though I must confess that I've never had it in Spain. However, it may be hard on Cambio but I find it hard to bring myself to award tapas 5 stars. So they're getting 4 stars with the caveat that it's the best tapas I've eaten.The staff were fantastically hospitable and friendly and nice to note they were all Spanish speaking. There was a slight mix up with the order but I think that was just a slight mis-communication between waiting staff rather than any systematic failure.The menu is divided into tapas/starters and a main course section. The main courses were mainly larger (I presume) \u00a0portions of some of the tapas menu. The menu recommended 3-4 tapas dishes per guest but a word of warning that my friend and I were fully sated on 2.5 dishes each. The portion size is generous and the food prersentation was also excellent with more effort being expended in this direction than all other tapas places I've been to.A complimentary bowl of excellent olives (not too salty) and freshly baked bread and olive oil were offered to start.The crispy ham and bechamel sauce croquettes were fantastically light and served with a sublime tomato sauce - if they could bottle the sauce and sell it, Heinz would be out of business! \u00a0The sauce just tasted of sunshine and tomatoes in every bite and I used my bread to mop up every last drop of it!The roasted cod in chicken consomme was cooked to translucent perfection and flaked off in fresh slabs. The consomme lent just enough depth of saltiness to offset the fish. The cod skin crackling was a nice contrast in texture.Corn fed crispy chicken arrived as 2 large roulades with the skin fried to perfection and went well with the corn puree.I persuaded my friend to try one unusual dish and it's a tribute to the restaurant that she really enjoyed the pulpo (octopus). It wasn't chewy at all and had been fried so the edges were lovely and crispy.We shared a light dessert of hazelnut praline, chocolate ice cream and sauce to finish.Cambio is worth a trip is you're a tapas fan and a good introduction for those who have yet to sample this style of food.",

    "text": "My friend and I stopped by Cambio De Tercio for a late quick bite on a Thursday night. The place was pretty busy and they led us to our table right away. My friend noticed that as we were being seated, our waitress expressed extreme frustration to the hostess for taking a late table, it all went down hill from there.Our waitress was obviously annoyed the whole time. When our tapas arrived, everything seemed fairly good, except for the chicken which upon cutting into it, I realized it was mostly raw on the inside (pink juices ran out and the meat was translucent). I am really shy about sending things back, and this waitress already hated us, but did not want salmonella from eating raw chicken so I reluctantly told our waitress. She did not speak English so she asked a waiter to come. He apologized and then left with the chicken. 1 min later he comes back with it - the same chicken! and announces it's fine. Who does that? At least please offer us a fresh batch or attempt to cook the other ones a bit longer. What did he do to it in 1 min?! We never ate it. It went way down hill after this after this.It became obvious that our original waitress couldn't even deal with us. She stopped coming to the table. Instead, the other 3 waiters/waitresses on duty took turns doing drive-bys. They didn't ask us if we needed anything, they just kept passing by us and looking at us briefly and scurrying away. At one point one of them stopped and told us we should eat the roasted tomato because \"it tastes bad cold\". He then cut it up and put it on our plates. Creepy. And clearly they were trying to get us out of there as quickly as possible. We were about 3/4 done with our dinner but couldn't take the obvious rudeness by the waitstaff who were doing their best to get us out of there. We asked for the check (of course they did not take the chicken off), paid and when we got up to leave, they opened up the glass door next to our table to get us out, rather than let us go out the front door of the restaurant.Hands down the most obnoxious service ever.I was elated to have not woken up with food poisoning that night given how rude they were to our faces I was terrified at what they might have done to our food.Creepy and nasty waitstaff+ Average tapas = avoid",

    "text": "Most Londoners think that Spainish Cookery consists of a very simple rustic fare like meatballs,croquettes, and paella. But these days there is a new school of thought developing the rustic side into the more creative by using high quality ingredients of Spainish tradition and presenting them in a more flamboyant way. The restaurant is one of the few that has welcomed the change embracing the \"neuva cosine\" with a vigour. Typical dishes like the Gazpacho is made very exciting witha chunk of Lobster and a scoop of cherry sorbet in the middle. I think that the Sea Bream with Courgette and Spinach puree and Manchengo cheese is a wonderful combination. On my last visit there not so long ago the 12 hour slow-roasted Oxtail in red wine was the best followed by King Prawns in Garlic which had quite a kick and a very pleasing taste in the mouth.",

Let's just say we were delighted with the food, and less so with the service. The moment we arrived, they rushed us to a table with menus and then disappeared for a bit. We wanted to ask for wine recommendations but the waiter insisted that we wait until after we ordered. We decided to stick with tapas as most of us had snacked beforehand and chose an interesting array - quail, caramelised oxtail, white asparagus, tuna tatar in addition to some not so average croquetas, squid, and calamari. Have to say that pretty much every dish was utterly divine and had an interesting modern twist in its presentation and flavour or texture. The waiter did provide an excellent wine recommendation (they properly pour it into a decanter, which I appreciated) but service was a bit shaky in that it was a bit slow and sporadic. The waiter did warm up to us though, and ended up having a pretty interactive conversation with us about Android phones. He later rewarded us with some sweet nibbles and a shots of peach schnapps, which was a nice way of changing our minds about the service. Bill came out to be about \u00a3160 for about 2 tapas each plus a bottle of wine, so certainly not the cheapest tapas around. Rumour has it that their sister restaurant across the street is better value for money.",

It's delicious, entertaining and very reasonably priced. The wine list has encyclopaedic scope and covers practically every corner of Spain's contemporary - and already legendary - new high expression wine scene.

There was only one other table so I should have known but the food was really unimpressive. The octopus was disgusting. I ordered a skate/meatball dish that was mediocre at best. I asked for regular water and they gave me a bottle of still-fine but between the charge for that and charging me for bread that I did not ask for or eat, my bill ended up at 42 pounds for food that I honestly couldn't eat. I dislike being charged for bread that I don't eat at a meal that was bad anyways.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner with my dad, following recommendations of many of my friends, so I didn't panic when the bill came. It is the high end brother of the Spanish tapas bars on the same street (which happens to be next door to my new place!) The atmosphere is cool but not pretentious, everything is sleek and dark that makes it feel very Spanish! The menu includes a lot of different tapas, from the traditional croquetas and jamon to special dishes. Everything is amazing and portions and not small at all. Wine list is huge, but we followed the sommelier advice to go with a Spanish wine that could fit the food (many of the wines on the list are Spanish though) The service is good, they really take good care of you without being too overwhelming. It is quite expensive, but deserved.",

    "text": "I would say this is what I expect from a restaurant in South Ken. It's sleek, polished; the service is excellent; the food and wine above average. I'll keep it short, because I drank a bit of wine and enjoyed the company more than I brooded over the food, which is very unlike me, but anyway...The croquetas with pimenton sauce were just okay. There definitely exists better in London. I enjoyed the chorizo and the oxtail tapa was also quite good. I had the pork belly main, but apparently should've gone for the pluma instead. The pork belly had a nice crackly skin, but the fat wasn't as melty (technical term) as I would have liked. I had a white chocolate ganache with passion fruit for dessert, which I wouldn't recommend. The ganache was way too sweet for the tart nature of the passion fruit. It's a great place for friends or for a date, if you're in the area. Otherwise cheaper and more delectable tapas places can be found in London.",

We'd see other waiters bringing out food, but not our guy, and the tables he was serving sat and sat, waiting. The pace of eating was completely disrupted.Asked for a specific wine, was later told 'Sorry' with the suggested wine 3x more pricey, declined it and ordered one less pricey, only to be told 10 minutes later 'Sorry'. Ordered recommended bottle of overpriced wine, not worth the price. What crap!When he brought the bill, he didn't even look me in the eye or say a word. What a jerk, and what a jerk was I go come here. Maiden and only trip we'll be taking here.",

The menu had changed completely from what they had online when we made the reservation and we found it very challenging to find something that didn't involve the parts of animals most people refuse to eat(pig hoof, duck liver, etc). We explained that we were just going to enjoy our drinks that just came out and be on our way, might I add we paid nearly 40 pounds for them. The restaurant was at about 10% occupancy, however the manager embarrassingly came over and asked for us to leave. Likely one of the most unprofessional actions I've come across in my dining experience. Will not be returning and will advise others not to dine here.",

The combination of ingredients were inspiring and the quality was top class. Having said that, the setting and atmosphere doesn't fit the food. It's a chic hipster setting with no soul or feel to it. To this, you can add the service, which is great if you like rush hour traffic. All the staff are running around like mad cows with trays and glasses and shout warning signals to each other in order to prevent crashed. Not very pleasant. The serving was made in record speed with 3 waiter throwing the food in front of you with little explanation of what the chef has probably spend a lot of time creating. You have to ask for the details yourself. Finally my biggest annoyance when eating out. It is proper to let everybody finish their meal before removing the plates. Here they pull out your plate the second you put down your knife and fork. That is just not right! Learn some manners! I had expected more when I dine in a place like this. So in total - top marks for the food, but none for the service.",

    "text": "Any restaurant that proffers legitimate cloth napkins in the toilets for you to dry your hands off with is a venue I'd consider upmarket. You can benchmark your expectations on what a dining experience here is likely to cost you based on this fact alone.The most noteworthy aspect of our meal here wasn't the food (though that was quite nice) or the ambiance (which was exceptionally swanky), it was the service, full stop. We're talking the kind of all-up-in-yo'-bidness service where you couldn't take a sip of wine without someone immediately coming by to refill your glass. And the exacting standards of presentation that would rival Monk's OCD. Truth.It's unclear whether or not this was intentional, but our dishes were served in order of homely to heavenly.Starter Tapas:- 'Nuevas' Patatas Bravas were inventive, but more like blah potato balls than the crisp, spicy, creamy mixture we expected (and honestly, would have preferred)- Serrano ham croquetas were marginally better, and improved even more with the savoury tomato dipping sauceHeavier Tapas:- Our grilled octopus was suitably fresh and tender, conjuring images of sitting on a sun-drenched deck overlooking the glittering aquamarine of the Mediterranean- And the ox tail with 'green apple textures' offered a rich, mouthwateringly lush tender meat dish balanced against the tart apple for a clean finishMain:- Do not miss out on the suckling pig. Served on rosemary mash au jus, this was unquestionably the pinnacle of our meal. In fact, if we'd skipped over much of the first half, it would have been worth the trip for this alone. Crisp, fatty, succulent, and scrumptious, it was everything a main should be. It was only enhanced with the side of padron peppers we ordered along with itDessert:- After considering the options, the Valrhona liquid chocolate cake stood out the most; it vanished without a trace, even though we were both feeling quite satisfiedAs if all the above wasn't enough food, we were offered gratis lemon syrup lady fingers and chocolate ganache truffles on espresso beans. They even poured us some Zoco Pacharan [aol.it/hJyWu3] for a post-prandial digestif to seal the deal.All that goes to say... if someone else is shelling out the cash for a multi-course meal and a bottle of wine here, there'd best be some putting-out happening afterwards. I'm just sayin'...I dig it, but don't expect to be back. It's just a little too rich for my blood, and just a little too not-spectacular to justify the expense.",
