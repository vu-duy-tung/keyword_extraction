At first I was a bit put off by the crazy loud restaurant and the super busy atmosphere but once we were settled all was well! The food definitely delivered - I had the Lobster Fest which consists of \u00a0a whole lobster served with fries, salad & a free slushie cocktail or beer, all for just \u00a320! I had a slushie margarita which was pleasantly surprising for a free cocktail; I expected all sugar and no booze! All in all, I left a very happy lady with a belly full o' lobster!",

My second visit at the restaurant on Tuesday with bigger crowd was great too, but my friend ordered \"bottomless\" shrimps at a good price but toooo oily for my liking. \u00a0They do also other unlimited serving on ribs and stuff. Check out the menu on the black board in the restaurant, check menu online or ask your waiter ;) enjoy the lobster fest, u will never regret.",

    "text": "Following on from Becky's review, mostly to make the HILARIOUS joke that the Big Easy is named in honour of your mum. Ziiiiiiiiiinnnngggggggg. Anyway. I can't argue with 50 % off a \u00a3150+ bill. But whilst I had a good time here (and previously at the King's Road branch), I still can't really get that excited about it, even though I know plenty of people who've raved about it. Perhaps it's because I've had the good fortune of never having been to Outback Steakhouse (I dunno if their advertising is representative but prawns just aren't that orange), but the food here is generally average. Sure, I shouldn't expect too much from somewhere which majorly upsells frozen margaritas, and you do get a decent amount of food for your money, but I'd rather go broke gorging myself on genuinely awesome food rather than going broke gorging myself on lots of filler. Anyway, 50 % off + giving Andrew M. ordering powers = big problems with fitting everything on the table. We had a sharing starter platter (deep fried prawns, calamari, hush puppies, wings), 1kg T-bone, 1.5lb lobster, smoked meat platter (pulled pork, ribs, chicken). Between 4. The lobster was definitely the best part - cooked well and genuinely tasty with a nice sweetness. I still prefer it Chinese style, but whatevs. I enjoyed. The T-bone was ok. In general, I prefer to only have steaks occasionally and splash out (I love how my mouth waters even just typing the word steak) and I probably wouldn't order again here as it's not particularly flavourful meat, but on the plus side it was a good rare (for the most part). The smoked meat platter was fair, again, kind of inoffensive without huge amounts of flavour. As Becky said - the mushrooms. They were so wood flavoured you could dry them out and smoke salmon with them. Seriously. It was a weird one. I mean, I hardly ever let mushrooms go to waste. The service was mostly ok (given soft opening) although there were an unbelievable number of crockery breakages (at least 4 separate crashes in the space of an hour). Definitely need to hire Yinnie to whip that lot into shape. If you want reasonable drinks and lots of food, it's great. There are good deals on most week days and it's always a good group place. Still, for me it's more excess than enjoyment, but then again, there's a time and a place. Inevitably I'll be back sooner rather than later and, inevitably, I'll be stuffing my face.",

They have the largest stock of whiskey, it's all lined up along the wall and they use ladders to climb around and take them down. The staff is also super nice and if I ever need a drink in central London, this is where I go! The have a nice menu too and if you want seafood without selling some organs, this is the place to go. I took my family here when they came to visit and they absolutely loved it! In my opinion though, the food could be a bit more flavorful and that is the only reason I'm not giving it a 5. If I went out to eat for the atmosphere and wicked bibs, I would have given it a 5+. Unfortunately though, I go out to eat to eat food. And that is also what I'm basing the review on.",

    "text": "There are a lot of things I liked about the Big Easy in Covent Garden. Having gone for a late dinner, we were surprised to find that the sheer volume of food offered (in both menu and more so in size of portion) was immense. It was big enough to make me feel back home in the American South, or at least like I was at a Red Lobster. An American Chain is probably an apt metaphor for Big Easy as while the food was good and quite copious, the pace at which it was brought to us was reminiscent of the slow pace of life on the Louisiana bayou. Admittedly we showed up 30 minutes early for our reservation and had a drink in the bar, but we weren't seated until 30 minutes after our reservation time. Once sat, it took another 45 minutes for the food to arrive, bringing the entire dinner experience (from arrival to paying and departing) to around 2 hours and 30 minutes. Given we arrived at 9:45 pm, leaving for home a shade after midnight really reminded me of a wild (or atleast long night) out on bourbon street. The food itself is quite good, as we tried the lobster and steak (both amazing) as well as the mac & cheese and hushpuppies. While the hushpuppies were closer to churro than what I might get back home, everything was delicious. The bar area has an amazing selection of drinks as well and would be worth just dipping in for a drink. Overall, I'll probably go again (if only because all you can eat is equal parts an invitation and challenge to someone from the American South) but given the pace at which a meal happens, I'll probably just come in the afternoon and make a day of it.",

It is massive for one while the original feels cramped and the power plant skeleton of the building makes for a dramatic interior. Going to the men's room is a journey like lord of the rings. Bring a canteen and a compass. I am amazed at the consistent quality and the value for money.",

It's in a great location with a great atmosphere and buzz and it was testament to its popularity that we had to wait so long for our table despite pre-booking. We had a few drinks at the bar that were lovely but hellish expensive for something that came out of a slush puppy machine. The food is a nice mix suitable for most tastes and we ordered a broad spectrum of the menu to sample. Unfortunately most of this food arrived luke-warm at best and much had to be sent back. That being said, the staff were very apologetic and quickly reissued the food and as a gesture of good will refunded the birthday girl's meal. All in all we had a great night and would return though the upper hand that somewhere like Red Dog Saloon has is that being smaller, it's spread less thin and is all around quicker. Also, bring a snack to the bathroom as it's three miles away from the restaurant.",

We started off with the 2-person appie platter, with 2 types of wings, and other deep fried seafood goodies. The calamari was thin, dry and chewy, and I personally wasn't a fan of the deep fried fish/potato balls. The prawns and wings were good but overall, everything was just warm when we got it. For our mains, we shared the 1kg T-bone steak, BBQ taste-o-Rama platter, and a lobster (along with a few other sides and sauces). The ribs were a bit dry, but I thought everything else was pretty good (considering the balance of price-portion-quality). \u00a0One if the things I really didn't like were the wild mushrooms - if I were to gnaw on a piece of bark, this is what I think it would taste like. Big disappointment, considering I love mushrooms!This visit was about a month after their grand opening, but I felt there were still a few things left to be ironed out. The food didn't take too long but it definitely could have been more fresh / hot (this was 10pm on a Sunday night). I wouldn't say the food is the best, but it's fair value for what you get, and the bar looks pretty impressive. Another thing to note - I tried looking for the daily deal menu but couldn't find it for this location (unlimited rib nights, shrimp nights etc). Worth looking into, but I had the unlimited fried shrimp at the Chelsea location and it was great!",

    "text": "I've been to the Kings Road location so I was super pumped when I heard a bigger location was opening in Covent Garden. I went after the soft opening but I'm not sure if the issues I encountered were still due to them ironing out bits.We were led down the big staircase into a big seating area downstairs. We were sat in a table for 2 sandwiched between 2 other tables, so close we had to move our table up to the next one in order for me to get in and out. Needless to say, we soon got to know our neighbours very well and thankfully they were lovely!To start, we had the Pit-Smoked Bar.B.Q Chicken Wings and the Pick 'n' Lick Shrimp In the Shell with Hot 'n' Spicy sauce. The wings reminded me of what you'd get in North America and the blue cheese sauce was a lovely touch. You're paying about \u00a31 a wing though. \u00a0The shrimp were big and saucy, with a generous piece of bread to mop everything up with. For our mains, we had the Taste-O-Rama and the Lobster bake with a side of chips and cornbread. The portions were huge, making them fairly good value for the price (both were under \u00a320 each). Aside from the size, the rest of it was ok, nothing blew me away. The biggest issues were the chicken and ribs in the Taste-O-Rama. The chicken was so dry we couldn't eat it, even with the sauce provided. Maybe it's because we were just at \u00a0Chicken Shop a few days prior and you just can't compare. Also, the ribs were dry and slightly pink. We weren't sure if it was the lighting of if the ribs were slightly under cooked. Either way, we proceeded with caution. There was plenty of food to go around! The brisket and pulled pork were tender and the highlight. The cornbread was fantastic as well, but I was surprised not to be given a bit of butter for it. I've had a lot of cornbread and always love a bit of butter with it. The beans were also a highlight, and felt home-cooked. With the recent talk of food waste in the UK, I was conscious of the amount of food which we and our neighbours wasted. It was great to be presented with massive platters of food, but not so great when we could only manage to get through half of it and had to bin the rest. I hope the matter gets addressed in the future, whether it is encouraging sharing or giving diners an option to pack up the extras. Personally I'd rather pay a bit less and get a smaller portion ... I have to give them kudos for their expansive bar menu, featuring some 500 different bottles of liquor. If anything, we'll stop by again to sample some whiskies on offer! Don't let my review put you off, maybe the issues were due to growing pains and will get sorted out.",

Decadent with just the right amount of sweetness. \u00a0The seafood dishes were definitely better than the bbq dishes. \u00a0The taste of the garlicky butter sauce of my crab shack was just devine. \u00a0There were issue with the cooking overall, while the mussells and prawns were perfectly cooked in the Crab Shack, the crab itself was too dry. \u00a0My friend who had the lobster bake, had to return his because the prawns were uncooked while the lobster and mussels had were cooked. \u00a0Unfortunately, by the time we all finished our meals his replacement lobster bake was still nowhere to be seen and we had to cancel his order. \u00a0To be fair, by this stage we were all full from sharing everything anyway.The barbeque meats were okay. \u00a0All the meats could have used with a good amount of extra sauce for flavouring. \u00a0Both the ribs and brisket were fantasticly cooked with the meat moist and succulent. \u00a0The pulled pork disappointingly dry.Chips were fantastic. \u00a0We were all happily in a carb coma with all the chips and potatoes that come with the mains.Cocktails were coyingly sweet and I don't rate them. \u00a0The house wines were surprisingly good and good value for money.",

    "text": "Simply put....\"BE\" (Big Easy) Convent Gardens is not as good as their brother crab shack in Chelsea, but still worth a visit.First impressions were good, the service staff were very friendly and helpful. We went in the evening on a Tuesday night for my girlfriends birthday. We asked to move downstairs and were relocated quickly and politely. We felt like we had our own host in a bustling busy restaurant..A good start...Unfortunately their efforts were spoilt with the food and beverage. I ordered a mixed BBQ plate and found it to be lacking the flavour I had become accustomed to at the Big Easy in Chelsea. The BBQ plate was laden with meat, and with beans, coleslaw and chips...its a good feed. Sadly the piles of meat are barely warm and lacking flavour \u00a0their brother offers in abundance. Also their Pina Colada cocktail I love love love was nothing like BE Chelsea....it was awful...My girlfriend loved her Lobster though, and I loved my lobster cocktail entree. So I guess if you appreciate good food steer clear of the BBQ smoked meats, I found them cold, lacking taste and unappetizing...I felt like I was eating yesterdays BBQ off cuts..not todays....maybe focus more on freshly grilled meats or seafood when you order.Overall when I ask myself the question....YES I would take friends there again, but as a fun place for a munch and a drink, not a food destination... its a lovely space, really well done, the service staff are great. Sadly the kitchen hasn't got it together yet...But BE Covent Gardens is still newly opened so maybe they will improve with time.One more tip, if you over order you can get doggy bags, being they serve you half a farm on with the popular Meat O rama....this is a good thing...",

The table next to ours were ordering from the main menu and seemed to receive much better service. For \u00a310 a head this was really a pretty small issue and will certainly be coming back. Craft beer menu was also excellent. Great to get a decent drink (not the usual bottled Bud etc).",

The waiter eventually came over and took our order to which we waited quite a while for them to be delivered. I ordered a starter of \"hush puppies\" which was pleasant but very dry even with the sauce followed by a beautiful 14 oz Ribeye which was to die for. Apparently all you get for the money was the steak so had to order chips as a side. Quite a bit pricey but it is Covent Garden really. The place was busy as it was a Saturday night so can forgive the poor timing of the service but I also agree you had better not need the toilet urgently as you may have an accident on the ridiculously timely rabbit run to the toilet. Overall a nice place to visit but you can get far better locally for less!",

    "text": "On arrival, our group of 4 got a warm greeting and friendly service. This new(ish) Covent Garden branch has perhaps a slightly different vibe from the original Kings Road location with its hipster baiting modern industrial vintage decor (all purposely repurposed wood and neon crustaceans in lobster cages, flatteringly lit with dangerously low hanging light fittings).We were seated (despite arriving early, so brownie points for that) and our order was taken quickly. However, this was followed by a 40 minute+ wait for our food during which our waiter was invisible. At no point was there an acknowledgment of (let alone apology for) our wait. When the food eventually turned up, the steak looked quite spartan although it was tasty. Unfortunately my deep fried shrimps were (unforgivably) overcooked and underseasoned although there were at least a decent (10) serving of them atop a small pile of slightly-too-greasy chips (rather than fries I was promised by the menu - I'm a big fan of the chip shop chip, but if a meal in an American restaurant is described as being accompanied by 'fries' I expect a bundle of skinny and delicious FRIES dagnabit). The pulled pork dishes ordered by two of my dining companions was by far the best thing - moist, tender and served with a delicious, tangy BBQ sauce (and I say that as someone who is far from a fan of the stuff under most circumstances). The pulled pork sandwich was, however, superior to the standalone pulled pork dish in terms of size and value for money. Having had my mood befouled by the interminably long wait for what turned out to be an underwhelming lunch, a smattering of other irritations (e.g. rock salt in the grinders, traditionally not great for seasoning food at the table; being given some lemon slices from the bar in response to a request for an extra lemon wedge for squeezing over my seafood dish; being needlessly wedged into a table so small that I ended up playing elbow hockey with the pint sized diner behind me - and so, frustratingly, on) just needled away at me. Interesting surrounds and adequate food (which would normally have earned a 3 star review) undone by the perishingly long wait for it.",

    "text": "I was so looking forward to going for dinner at Big Easy and as an American visiting London the menu looked like a piece of home. We had to make reservations a month in advance because they are always crowded, even on a weeknight. And I highly recommend doing the same because you might have to wait more than an hour if you are just walking in. We came here on a Tuesday night for the Limitless Jumbo Shrimp. The Limitless Shrimp comes with a Slushie drink. The drink was pretty good and definitely strong, which isn't a bad thing :) The shrimps we got were HUGE and really tasty and there were also lots of chips. (For the next round I asked for more Shrimp and only a few chips which my waiter was happy to serve us) Because it was limitless we decided to get our money's worth and order a second round. Firstly it look forever to flag down our waiter to even tell him we wanted another round. Once we got his attention 20 minutes later to ask for another round, our shrimps took ages to come out. We had to walk over to our waiter twice and tell him our shrimp still hadn't come out. After an hour of waiting we were fed up at this point and didn't even care for our next round. Our waiter quickly came over and was very apologetic and offered us another slushie drink and finally brought out our shrimp. I give it 2 stars because from the food that we did get to eat it was really good but other than that it was an extremely disappointing experience. Big Easy you got to hire more wait staff (because our waiter was way too overwhelmed by the number of tables he was in charge of) or work something out so that the food is served at a reasonable manner. Unfortunately, don't know if I'll be coming back to Big Easy during the night for dinner, maybe during the day time it'll be less crowded.",

And it's easy to like.After an epic Monday of watching Guardians of the Galaxy at the BFI IMAX Waterloo, Big Easy was sent in to keep things on a high and it did.Mondays is unlimited ribs, chicken, chopped pork and hush puppies, a king of cornball. A Ma-hoo-sive platter is initialy delivered to your table, along with your choice of some tasty Big Easy ales or a cocktail. After that you just munch. If you finish your platter or get close to it, you just ordered more of what you want. It's that simple. You can only eat so much though and Big Easy are clever in this regard, I didn't get past the giant platter that was shared between 4 persons. But it was still good value for money.Service is great. Each person responsible for their own zone, and whilst generally service is good, if your attendee is busy no-one else can really help you.Toilets. Are. Far. It's like a maze where you go through 6- doors, up and down stairs to get here. It's quite an experience. In all, superb food, great value for money, pleasant atmosphere and what a range of food. I probably will try the lobster next time I'm here as it looked quite good.",

    "text": "A big BBQ fan, I was eagerly anticipating our visit to The Big Easy. From the food, I wasn't let down. My boyfriend's St Louis ribs were fantastic - easily the best we've had in the last year - and I enjoyed my 250g sirloin steak and half lobster, which is the Thursday special, as ridiculous as it sounds. The voodoo shrimp to start were also scrummy, with delicious sauces complementing the crunchy, large prawns. So although I was happy food-wise, there were a few flies in the ointment that lead me to downgrade it from fully recommended to just a decent option. Firstly, I think it's too expensive for the sort of restaurant it is. In some ways, they make up for this with the specials and the early/late menus (which seem like particularly great value at \u00a310 for two courses, though you do have to be eating at a weird time to take advantage). But everything on the standard menu just seems like a bit of a stretch for quite a casual meal, particularly if they don't include sides, with many coming in at around \u00a320. And starters are also a bit of a pisstake - we really wanted the voodoo shrimp, and they were good, but it was \u00a39.90 for six, which wasn't completely out of sync with the other starters. What irritates me (this might sound weird) is that there's SO much food. Neither my boyfriend nor I could comfortably finish our meals. We'd have been happy with more normal portions but spending 2/3 of what we did - it just makes it feel unnecessary. However, knowing this now if we went back, we would probably share the ribs and maybe a starter (which would still mean spending about \u00a318-\u00a320 each depending on if you get a drink and/or a side, which again feels a lot considering you are sharing something that is supposedly for one person).We also had varied service. Our waiter was lovely and very helpful for making menu selections. Food came VERY quickly - i.e. before our drinks, which felt kind of weird and not what we wanted, and also made it seem like we were just in a factory line and they were pushing us through. But on the other hand, when we asked for the bill, we had to wait 20 minutes to actually pay, which was probably about a quarter of the time we spent there in total.I would go again - but I would either try to go for the pre/post theatre menu, or split a meal with someone to make it reasonable value.",

I didn't order food as I was on one of the tables full of beers. I will definitely be back at some point for food though. There aren't many thing I wouldn't do for a full rack of ribs and a nice rare steak so this place has me covered for my return.

    "text": "After many failed attempts at walking into The Big Easy's Covent Garden location, I had the foresight to make a reservation in advance to take the carnivore in my life to indulge in a protein-fueled feast for his Birthday. We were time constrained because we were eating before a show on the West End and this caused some confusion- I made the reservation for 18:15 after seeing that they had a pre-theatre menu available on their website; however, when they rang to confirm the booking that afternoon, I was advised \u00a0that items from the pre-theatre menu must be ordered before 17:45. As it seemed too risky to reconfigure our plans, I explained that we had exactly one hour to order, eat and settle our bill. The woman who sat us enthusiastically noted this would be possible- I also advised her that it was my boyfriend's Birthday and she indicated that a cupcake would be arranged and sent over to us- sadly, this surprise never came into fruition in the haste of us paying and leaving!The Big Easy boasts a lively, moody atmosphere and typifies everything you expect from an American barbeque joint- it's a guaranteed good night out and will satisfy any meat eater or seafood lover's cravings. The food is bombastic and messy, slathered in the house barbecue sauce or swimming in creamy or spicy stock. The meats come delivered on wooden blocks or, in my case, the seafood arrived in a bulky cast-iron skillet. The portion sizes also exemplify what you would expect from America: bordering on greedy, but you definitely feel like you are getting good value. The food isn't exactly cheap, especially for some of the steak options and the Nova Scotian lobster, but that is typical for London.I can't neglect to mention the bottomless specials on offer throughout the week, as I imagine that these are extremely popular. We were there on a Tuesday, which was deemed unlimited jumbo shrimp night (or unlimited portions of a Southern shrimp broil) for a seemingly reasonable price of \u00a319 per person. This included a selection of sides and a slushie cocktail or beer. They offer an unlimited hog roast on Wednesdays and other specials throughout the week.My boyfriend ordered a Taste-O-Rama platter, a professed cornucopia of meats consisting of pit-smoked barbecued chicken, dry-rubbed St Louis pork ribs, Carolina pulled pork and smoked beans and coleslaw on the side. He opted to add the Texas brisket as well because- damn it- it was his Birthday. Everything arrived smothered and glazed and he happily tucked in, affirming that each item in turn was smoked to perfection. He even thoroughly enjoyed the barbecue beans on the side even if they were humble compared to his primary concerns. There were no carbs here to act as filler, so he managed to put away every last morsel without complaining of the type of sweats that often accompany such rich foods. As a seafood eater, I opted for the Crabshack Combo in a spicy soup, which arrived as a sample of giant shrimp (singular), several crab claws, mussels, calms and a handful of new potatoes bobbing in a spicy broth. This was a monster of a dish, requiring untold effort to tuck into- as a warning, do not order this if you are:A) In a rush; orB) Going to the theatre.I was left frantically cracking away at my crab claws and fishing out the meat with various instruments right up to the wire- it was both ugly and messy. The food was delicious, but I had lingering remnants of the meal underneath my fingernails for at least a day afterwards. It was na\u00efve on my part to be allured by this selection, but everything emerged from a wood burning oven in perfect condition; the mussels were plump, the crab was succulent and the shrimp was rich and meaty. I was not offered any wet wipes, however, which would have been appreciated.The atmosphere is relaxed, the waiters were helpful and there was notes of the blues wafting across the restaurant. I hear that the live jazz band plays every evening and they are worth the trip alone. The cocktails are also supposed to be out of this world.Our service was a bit staggered, but this is a very busy and buzzy restaurant that makes attentive service an impossibility- we could have used a bit more attention to clear the plates provided for discarded crab shells and the promise of a Birthday cupcake was never fulfilled (and that would have been a nice touch).We will certainly return to this location of The Big Easy again, but I will order more prudently and we will pace ourselves and make sure to catch the live music. This is a great spot in central London for a boisterous night out in a group.Beware that you will be offered a plastic bib- it's just that kind of joint.",

The taste o rama is a lot of food so come hungry or share the tasting platter with a friend.Decent selection of whiskey helps to end the night on a good note.",

This time round I ordered the Pit-Smoked Bar.B.Q Chicken Wings to start and The Texas Sliced Slow-Smoked Brisket sandwich for mains. The wings were tasty although a bit too expensive for what you get. The Texas Sliced Slow-Smoked Brisket sandwich was the stuff dreams are made of - perfection. The meat is so tender and flavoursome you don't want it to end. It comes with chips and 'slaw also which are fantastic. However make sure to order some bbq beans and cornbread on the side which are two of my favourites! Forget about Burger and Lobster this place is far superior.",

    "text": "The food - good. The best BBQ we have since moving abroad from Dallas, Texas nearly three years ago. For those of you who want a bit more detail, the mac-n-cheese was too sharp/strong. They need to tone down the strength of the cheddar used. The baked beans were too sweet. I recon they were made from Heinz baked beans because my husband has tried to make baked beans from Heinz beans and they turned out similar although not as sweet and more of a consistency of refried beans. The St. Louis ribs were good - a huge portion that can easily be split between two people. The beef brisket was also a huge portion and was good but was a little dry. Really, I can not complain about the meats. Each \"meat\" came with a side of coleslaw (very good) and potato salad which is more of a mayonnaise base rather than a mustard base.Value for money - this place is spot on. As stated before, the portion size is good.Service, as with most restaurants in the UK, is lacking. Staff were assigned too many tables which made service slow and scarce. We ordered a starter of voodoo wings and were delivered BBQ wings and were not able to snag our server to return them. We also ordered a round of beers and they never arrived. Space and location is good. We inadvertently made our reservation for the Chelsea location and when we arrived at the Covent Garden location (and realized the error of our ways), they offered to put us to the top of the wait list and told us to hang out in the bar and they'd find us in approximately 30 minutes. One hour and 20 minutes later (and after checking in with the hostess), we were seated downstairs. Downstairs is not where you want to be, even though there is live music down there because live music is loud and the kitchen is also downstairs which makes it HOT!A couple things to note:-Toilets are downstairs-There is another bar with about 6 barstools downstairs-Live music is downstairs-There is a sink where you can wash your hands upstairs in the bar area",

The place was packed and it was around 8:30. \u00a0I wanted the Lobster Roll after looking at the menu online and was promptly told they didn't have any, after speaking with my server, I came to find out they did have lobster, just not the whole lobsters. I ordered hush puppies for my starter which were nothing like what I would call hush puppies so that was a disappointment. My boyfriend ordered a massive amount of food with lots of meat and I tried it all and the best thing was the pork. Chicken was kind of dry, and everything else on the plate paled in comparison to the pulled pork. My lobster roll was awful and I wish I would've stuck with the pulled pork sandwich. The service was extremely slow, and we almost ending up walking up to the waitress with our card to get out. We asked for our bill and waited at least 30 minutes for it to be delivered to us. Beer is good, but a little pricey for London. I am an American and my boyfriend British so maybe I have higher expectations for BBQ, but I suppose overall it was good. Next time I would just stick to the pulled pork. Best to go with the classic!",

Starting with the good, the atmosphere in the restaurant \u00a0is amazing, the food is pretty good and the table service was second to none when I was there! I had a BBQ blow-out, which had 4 different meats on there such as pulled pork, ribs, brisket and roast chick. All of them were very nice apart from the roast chicken which was very dry. I regret not trying some of the seafood such as the lobster as it looked so good. The food was pretty good.The venue was very nicely themed and had a decent amount of space up and down stairs. Apart from the bar that didn't have much space at all!The lady that seated us was very friendly and chatty and helped us quickly and efficiently.Some issues I had was while we waited to be seated at the bar it was a major struggle to get a drink as it was so busy, also it was pretty expensive 3 cocktails for just over \u00a330. This is expected as we are in central london.I had a really good time in the big easy, I will \u00a0be going back. Not gonna miss out on that lobster again!+ also had a live band there that played nice chilled music while you eat! Which was very good!!+ AMAZING selection of cocktails and drinks",

We got a table for 3 and were told that we had to be done by 8pm. No problem as me and the boys were Hank Marvin. The setting is pretty cool industrial like someone else mentioned and its dark but lively. The bar had a huge selection of booze and they had their own beers on tap which were ok. The walk to the toilet is loooong, long ting! Did I say it was long?There's a basin upstairs to wash up before dinner so it was cool. I had made the walk before in a failed attempt to eat there a few weeks before. We ordered the voodoo chicken wings and popcorn shrimps to start and they came in about 20 mins. The starters were good and the wings were spicy. Not too spicy. The shrimps weren't as good as I had in the past but were fine. Mains came soon after we had finished and luckily we opted not to sneak in another starter. The portions are big. I had the dry rubbed ribs with beans and slaw which were perfect. Plus real potato fries which were spot on. My mates had a platter each which consisted of qtr ribs, half a chicken and pulled pork. I tried a bit of the chicken which was delicious. The ribs were great I have had better in the USA but for London they were real good. All in all, a solid munch and a great experience. It has my seal of approval!Nina, you're a star x",

From the stunning display of craft spirits, small batch concoctions, slushies, and cocktails on tap this place has everything you could think of. I've never seen classics such as an old Fashioned or a Vieux Carr\u00e9 served on tap. And taste that good. It's almost criminal. It also helps that the bar staff are super fun and jovial. The slushies are definitely worth trying. My favourite is the sazerac slushy, a variation on a New Orleans classic. A nice change from the classic sazerac you can get at Nola or Happiness Forgets. This one is slightly on the sweeter side, stronger on the liquorice, but just as amazing as a drink on its own. The Miami Vice is also worth trying, which is a pina colada topped with a strawberry daiquiri. So refreshing on a summer day. Wish they had take away cups! Their craft spirit selection is pretty cool, and they serve bourbon from Smooth Ambler and Few Spirits rye whisky, which are some of my favourite brown drinks at the moment. Their house bourbon, \u00a0which they use for their Old Fashioned on tap is from Bulleit. Food wise, I've had their crab claws which are pretty damn good. But honestly, I come here to drink. And boy will I keep coming back. #gobig",

The best value dish on the menu is probably the Lobster Fest - available every day, you can have a whole 1 1/2 lb lobster served with fries, house salad & a slushie cocktail or schooner of ice cold craft lager or ale for just \u00a320.There's also a great value lunch / pre-theatre menu where you can have two courses and a drink for just \u00a310. Sounds a bit too good to be true.We both ordered a tasty slushie cocktail and the Bar-B-Q Blowout (\u00a319.90) which frankly, was far too much food for a lunch time! The blowout is a platter of pit-smoked Bar.B.Q chicken, dry-rubbed St Louis pork ribs, Carolina pulled pork with house made cornbread, pit-smoked beans, slaw and fries. Everything in the blowout was well cooked and full of delicious BBQ flavour. It's a great way to sample a wide range of dishes from the menu but make sure you're hungry. Really, really hungry.",

    "text": "Hahaha!Let me just start by saying that unless you have eaten IN the city of New Orleans, you can't possibly know what Nawlins-style creole food is supposed to taste like. This was one of those situations where I was so amazed at how tasteless my shrimp boil was, that I kept looking around to see if others were having the same reaction. I can only explain it by saying that English food doesn't carry the same spice and flavor of other cuisines, so they may be trying to appropriate an inherently spicy cuisine to a blander palette.My problem is when a restaurant appropriates a distinct type of cuisine, one that is meant to be swimming in spices, and puts absolutely ZERO flavor in it. None. I had a shrimp boil and I swear there was not even so much as a speck of garlic, butter, cayenne pepper...nothing. Just a bit of herb.Worst of all, my shrimp boil had FOUR shrimp and the rest was potatoes and a bit of corn. I know restaurants may try to save money by mixing in more of the cheaper ingredient, but this place didn't even try to hide the fact. That's hardly a shrimp boil. It's barely a shrimp cocktail.Have these chefs ever been to New Orleans or eaten proper creole food? If they have, then they are purposely making it bland for what they think the local palette would like. If they haven't, then they have no business attaching New Orleans to the food served here because it carries no flavor. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the bartender is amazing. He is a proper cocktail bartender, knows his stuff and is really passionate about it. \u00a0I would come here for the bar alone.",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of The Big Easy. The Big Easy first opened its doors on the Kings Road before launching this 'bigger little sibling' in Covent Garden. \u00a0I've never been to the King's Road location, but the Covent Garden restaurant is an incredible building. \u00a0It is built into an old electrical power station, the space dates back to 1883 when it was the HQ for the Charing Cross & Strand Electricity Supply Company.While it's not a perfect replication of true American BBQ, the smokiness is really what sets Big Easy apart from other London wannabe bbq joints - especially when it comes to their burger. \u00a0It's the most flavourful beef patty that I've had in London, full stop. \u00a0It's as if the grill tops have been infused with months and months of wood smoke and various other cuts of beef, pork, and chicken - and then when they cook a burger, the grill imparts that melting-pot of flavours into the beef. \u00a0The \"Smokehouse Burger\" comes served atop of some crispy veg and fried onions and topped with melted and smoked cheese, BBQ sauce, and THICK cut bacon. \u00a0They also offer BBQ pulled chicken, pulled pork or chopped brisket sandwiches. \u00a0All of these plus the beef Smokehouse burger sit on one of my \"best value in London\" lunch/pre-theatre deals. \u00a0For \u00a310 (between noon-6pm or from 10pm-close) Monday through Friday, you can pair one of these sandwiches with a good-sized starter or desert cupcake for just ten quid! \u00a0A REALLY good deal for London prices. \u00a0If you are a hardcore BBQ fan, I highly recommend the huge meat feasts from the Big Easy Pit. \u00a0The BBQ Blow Out Platter is the most American of the over-eating you can do, and for just under \u00a320 per person you get a massive deal for that. \u00a0They serve pit-smoked chicken, St Louis pork ribs, and Carolina pulled pork with cornbread and fries in massive amounts on an upside-down trash bin lid. \u00a0It's a meat lover's dream... AND you can add brisket to that mix for another \u00a33.I talk more in-depth about my experience on beeffanatic.com, my review site, but I'd say this is definitely worth dropping in for a bite and a drink!",

    "text": "So lobster is the new fried chicken it seems. The walk-up queues and the inability to book has always been a big turn-off, but as my date and I were skulking around Soho, cruising for some crustacean we happened upon the Big E on a blatantly busy night and thought, heck why not? Every other joint around here's usually booked, let's take a chance! Then happenstance happened and we made it in (as they happened to have had a cancellation). An optimistic waitress offered us to be seated for drink at the bar whilst we waited a surprisingly short time of 20 minutes for our table, but as I sidled up; before I'd chance to grow barnacles, the seat was brusquely whipped from under me; taken for another table.Usually, I can't stand standing, but was happy to standby back in the line for a chance to get a table here as I'd never come this close: practically within lobster licking distance! Again, booking isn't the finest thing about The Big Easy. If anything, for one irate punter in front of us, it was more of a big deal and not very easy. Whilst he was flapping like cock at a chicken ranch, cussing and spitting feathers at the long wait: (Tip!) I cooly suggested my date and I sit downstairs at the empty bar I spotted below. This trick worked a treat and we ordered ourselves a slap up supper and drinks at the bar. It was from this point though, that The Big Easy felt more like the big freeze when the bar tender who'd taken our order, gave us a very frosty reception. About to tuck into our tipples, a cheery waitress appeared and suggested our table was ready upstairs. Despite the salty service, we said we were happy to stay seated, now that we were finally anchored we reassured her, but she was having none of it and ushered us upstairs telling us we could no longer eat or drink at the bar below.Never-the-less we were \"upgraded\" to a cramped corner with an artic sea breeze blowing a gale from the air-con above me like the wind on a high sea. My chilly position in the dining room and the less than ship-shape operation of the service, wasn't cool. Being shown to our table was like navigating through a squall, waiters crashed around us, knocking our drinks into us and we had to sit as wet as sea dogs. Despite the seafood focus The Big Easy is strangely themed with servers sporting lumberjack shirts like Urban Outfitter's changing room assistants circa 2006. This was a high price to pay for a trip down memory lane.I simply had simple 'Dollar Wings' with tangy hot sauce to start: American Pub food. This is essentially what the Big Easy does, terrible southern comfort pub food. WHICH I LOVE! (Usually). Especially when it's a dollar. But there's noting on the menu for anywhere near a dollar, in fact it's a just a very overpriced Disnification of someones translation of a Texan roadside pub on the border of a college town. But worse. Also, you know how awkward it is when our Americans friends do impressions of us British people? \u00a0Well it was really awkward seeing these hapless waiters running this joint [in England], trying to attempt an impersonation of an American style establishment, without the flair and cool casual charisma that most American servers and bartenders have. Truly there was something rather Pythonesque about the buffoonery of The Big Easy's staff 'computer says no' style of care in looking after us and our orders. What was worse, was having to go back downstairs into the bowels of this ship to visit the bathrooms. One thing that was spot-on about this place was the seaside theme of the toilets; stinky Southend-like public toilets. Anyway I enjoyed the likes of Belle & Sebastian lilting over the line up of over cooked lobster, clipped chicken-wings all sadly with very broken bones and also whilst on my date at the table; deveining some of my own prawns, veiny-er than my muscly mates arms.",

This could be forgiven if the service and ambience was top notch, however, we didn't experience this.This place was busy, loud and difficult to hear others on your table. Downstairs the tables are packed so tightly together that walking around when trekking to the bathroom is a challenge, I would go as far to say that it could even be a fire hazard. Also, I'm not joking when I say the bathroom is a trek as it's a really long journey to get there. The service for us wasn't great. Maybe because they were extremely busy, but this shouldn't be an excuse. Firstly I ordered a glass of lager and it didn't come, after 20 minutes I reordered, it still didn't come, reminded the waitress, who then brought it about 10 minutes later. Also, there were not enough napkins and splash bibs on our table and I had to source these myself.All the steak orders were wrong and no apology given and the mac & cheese was very light on sauce. Also, the chips do not stay hot either, so you end up leaving then because they've gone cold.The seafood was good and I can't fault them on this. Nice big crab claws and massive prawns looked impressive on the plater and were tasty to eat. Also the spicy chicken wings are nice too.I probably won't return as there are far better BBQ places with a more competitive price.",

    "text": "I have to say eating at Big Easy is probably one of the weirdest dining experiences I've had. After ruminating for a week about what I might order (do I go for the fried shrimp special? do I go for something else? What about the shrimp boil? Well the reviews say the shrimp boil has no seasoning. Well my friend said the fried shrimp wasn't that good...), I showed up without a clue. The server (while adorable and Spanish) warned us in advance that it was his second day. It definitely showed as the number of mistakes he made were insane. To be fair it wasn't just him, it was everyone. It seemed that they had recently replaced the entire waitstaff with new people. We were told our fried pickles were calamari (they were definitely fried pickles). Drinks were forgotten. Drinks were delivered to the wrong people. I ended up ordering the shrimp boil, and we got brought the fried shrimp. Not just the once. And not twice. But three times they tried to tell us someone at our table had ordered fried shrimp. They hadn't. Foodwise, it seems like things can be hit or miss. The hot wings were fairly mild for me. But they were okay. The fried pickles actually were pretty good. The person who ordered the burger thought it was pretty terrible. The lobster was apparently nice, but not as good as other places you get lobster for a similar price. The steak and prawn combo was underseasoned. Turns out those of us who ordered the shrimp boil won the dinner lottery for the night. The shrimp boil was delicious. Really thick, spicy sauce with prawns, sausage, corn and potatoes. And it was all REALLY GOOD. Everything was cooked well and tasty. Because it was unlimited, I did order another plate, but I was already full. I didn't care. I was putting more of that deliciousness in my face if it killed me. I may have only eaten the shrimp and sausage out of the second one. But I was going to have more.I left feeling euphoric. I was ready to go nuts and give them the extra star that I thought they deserved for the shrimp boil. This morning, the euphoria is gone. They definitely need to up the service game if it's going to be anything better than average for me. To be fair, I'd definitely come back. But probably only on a Tuesday for the shrimp boil.",

The only hiccup we had was that around that time it was a changeover for servers but once it was sorted out everything went well. We ordered shrimp and the thick cut bacon as appetizers, but unfortunately our server came back to say that they had run out of bacon, as an alternative, because we weren't sure about any of the other apps, he got us a small portion of ribs, which we all then regretted not ordering as a main course! Honestly some of the best in London and the sauce is to die for. The seafood combo was given a good review if slightly overcooked, the burger was a thumbs up and the hog roast was fantastic!It's built in what appears to be an old factory or power station, and just a warning to the guys, the toilets are quite far, I think it's three different sets of staircases. Okay if you're sober but once you've had a few and full of BBQ, I could see this becoming a problem! A massive whiskey bar (although service if you're there can be a little slow...) I think they have a bar menu but didn't look at it. Booking is definitely necessary for this place, the number of times I've been looking for something at half six and get offered a 10pm slot...",

Hence, first tip: if you plan to be here on a Saturday night, make sure to have a booking. I ordered the lobster roll, which was average. The meat was fresh, but I felt like it was unimpressive compared to Lobster & Burger (my all-time favourite) and the portion was small. My bf ordered one of the rib combos, which came with all of ribs, chicken and pulled pork with sides (chips, coleslaw, difference sauces). We felt that his dish was definitely a great deal for value (only \u00a319ish) and that the quality was passable too. I quite liked the ambience -- very hipster and reminiscent of an American shack type of place. Overall, a good place but not the best.",

    "text": "I have to admit ... I dug my own grave here. I wanted to avoid the costly Burger & Lobster and instead had a not very nice, but still costly burger in this place. We met here for Book Club, which was not my best idea. Its just a bit too loud to talk nicely and its also very densely packed with furniture, as they try to get as much seating as possible out of this location. Our waiter was very new and very cute, but that didn't help him much when he brought breaded instead of boiled shrimps, not just once, but twice to our table. The starters were ok, but nearly swimming in fat. I had a burger, which was also very fatty ( battered onion rings and oily brioche bread) and the meat was kind of crumbly. I was not impressed. Especially when they brought me my beer (\u00a35.50) and it was still in its can. Canned beer? really? for that price? really?",

    "text": "I'll have to visit The Big Easy again, as I'm not sure it would be fair to judge them on the meal I had, which was on Thanksgiving Day. Granted, we went for lunch so it wasn't as hectic as it could have been at dinner, but despite my booking being for 2, I was asked literally 3 times after I had been seated whether I was ready to order my main (from a set Thanksgiving menu) even though I was clearly waiting for another party. Undeterred, I scanned the drinks menu and after perusing for a bit, settled on sweet tea. \"I'll have the sweet tea,\" I told the waitress when prompted. She looked at me blankly. \"Um, I don't know what that is,\" she replied, pen poised over pad. \"No worries, I'll show you!\" I said, pointing at the menu. \"Here you go. Sweet tea. A glass of that, please.\" Later, my husband seemed to have the same issue when ordering root beer ... \"What kind of beer would you like?\" she asked after he ordered. \"Um, root beer,\" he said. She went on to list the different types of beers in house. Again, we opted for pointing to the menu. The caeser salad was pretty good to start, although I wish it had come with a warning of the heaps of blue cheese it came accompanied with. I left about a third of it on the plate. Our Thanksgiving mains of smoked turkey, cornbread stuffing, cranberry sauce, green bean casserole and sweet potato was delicious enough ... but it arrived lukewarm and became cold within 10 minutes of us digging in. I couldn't be bothered to ask for it to be reheated as I was on my lunch break after all. After being whacked the \u00a375 bill (for food and drinks), I left feeling a little ... meh. Just as my rating says. I hope their lobster's better ...",

    "text": "Big Easy is a place for having a range of seafood as they serves lobster, crab, clams, mussels and prawn. All at a resonable price!We ordered the lobster bake which consisted of two jumbo prawns, half lobster, mussels, crab claws and some baby potatoes. You get to choose to be serve in spicy sauce or garlic sauce. For me it is definitely garlic sauce. However I would had like to been offered a bib as all other table around me was offered one. Then I might had less likely to get lobster staining my top. Also it would had been nice to have the seafood appliance to go through my lobsters and crabs shells. But I had to ask for it, which took ages to get a staff attention to bring me a pair.As well as seafood there are range of meat dishes included the sharing platter (Bar.N.Q Blow Out). We ordered the meat sharing platter but the meat was dry. I feel meat should be cooked but still retain it moist. The corn bread was odd as it tasted of sweet corn but had the texture of a cake. I would had rather got a proper corn on the cob.The service on the night that we took a friend from abroad to try was just slow. We didnt get much service and spent most of our time trying to get attention from a staff. Even when we had been asked if we finished our meal and we said yes, the staff serving us cleaned up less then half of our table and never returned. We had to tell them twice we have finished and would like to see the dessert menu.Overall the food is good for the seafood. But not convinced about the meat. In terms of service I feel it needs to improve if it intends to turn around their table in time. Also I preferred if the lighting was slightly brighter. Our light seem to have dim around half seven. I felt like sleeping! Zzzzzzzz!",

Not the best Mac and cheese I've ever had, but it was still pretty tasty. It also came with a mixed greens salad. Overall, the food was excellent.In addition to the stellar food and good prices, the service was definitely a highlight of this meal!

This came with spicy slaw and baked beans. Everything was super tender except for the ribs. These were a bit tough. Loads of flavour with everything even the beans! We also had an order of fried pickles because you can't go wrong there nor with the giant voodoo prawns. It was a super size feast! I was disappointed in the service. Slow and unreliable. We waited a long time to place our order and receive our drinks. Then couldn't find our waiter when it was time to go. Otherwise a fun place with a big bar and lots of Southern food.

    "text": "A small group of us meet infrequently for a catch up over beer and food - usually it's American style BBQ. We've been to Bodeans a few times and this time we wanted a change so chose Big Easy instead.Big Easy is a bit different from Bodeans. First off, it advertises itself as \"Bar.B.Q and Lobstershack\" whereas Bodeans is straight up BBQ. Personally, I'm inclined to believe that Big Easy is better. I find that the meat is a lot more juicy and smoky. They also have evening offers such as Limitless Wings on Wednesdays.We visited Big Easy's Covent Garden location (there's also one on Kings Road and another in Canary Wharf) as it was a nice central location. I'd been several times before so I was familiar with the set up.We arrived on time and were seated downstairs near the stage (did I mention that they have a live band?) Like a lot of central London locations they really cram the tables in so we squeezed our way into our seats and set about looking at the menu.None of us were in the mood for Limitless Wings and I'd been a little unwell so I opted for something a bit lighter. I went for the Pitmaster Sandwich which was brisket, hot link sausage and pickles in a brioche bun served with chips and coleslaw. It was delicious. The brisket was smoky and succulent and the hot link was spicy and juicy. There were just enough pickles to add an extra dimension of texture and sharpness. I also ordered some hush puppies. If you've never tried them they're sweet corn fritters and they're so light and fluffy it will make you want to die.One of my friends also ordered the Pitmaster Sandwich but with a portion of rib tips. Rib tips are the bits they cut off the end of the ribs to make the racks even in shape. They smoke them and soak them in bbq sauce. They were outstanding.The other two in our group went all in. They had one of the bbq platters; the Bar.B.Q Blow Out. This is a huge platter of food. On it there were pit smoked Bar.B.Q chicken, dry rubbed St Louis pork ribs, Carolina pulled pork, cornbread, fries and coleslaw. They even opted for the add-ons of Texas brisket and Texas Hot Links. You can tell that they enjoyed their meal as pretty much the only thing left on the plate at the end were the bones! From experience I know that the ribs are particularly good. I might even go so far as to say they're the best ribs I've had anywhere.For the food this came in at about \u00a325 per head. We got there in time for Happy Hour so (it runs from 4-7 on Sunday to Friday) drinks were ordered directly at the bar. If you ordered the right thing you were paying no more than \u00a33 a pint.Big Easy is a fantastic venue. We'll be going back again at some point. Perhaps for their bottomless brunch offer on a Sunday. Or for unlimited fried shrimp on a Tuesday. Either way, we'll be eating in some of the best \"Bar.B.Q\" in London.",

What i was impressed by was the enviornment which takes you away from covent garden streets to texas and food on other tables :). \u00a310 for chicken bbq sandwitch+ beer was not too bad but definitely not the best in the area.",

The Big Easy is everything you can expect from a crab shack and the atmosphere is more layed back than his fancy cousin Burger and Lobster.For \u00a320 you have a whole lobster, fries, salad and a beer or slushie (minus the rasberry blue syrup but with alcohol instead). Desserts are huge - I could never finish one so I would recommend to share. They also do ribs and steak but I didn't try them (yet. Lobster call is always stronger). Plastic bib provided. Don't hope to get a table without a booking though. The place is huge but it's impossible to just walk in and ask for a table in the evening (you might get lucky at lunch time).",

I started to notice this restaurant on social media and it is perfect place for a seafood lover. Here you go, I came to experience it all. I ordered the seafoods combination meal with lobster, crab claws, mussels. It taste so great and it took a while to down it. My friends had ordered pork ribs and pork meat feast..it was huge portion and saw them eat like a hungry ghost...i cannot believe it that they managed to finish it at last. Good attempt.

We were early so caught happy hour. Cocktails at 4 pound a hit!After seating we ordered the seafood. The brains a bit fuzzy now, but starters were a good plate of cold crab claws. Intense! Not to be outdone, I ordered the whole crab cooked in butter. Scrumptious!Two hours of solid eating, great food, great staff and service. Would I go back?In a heartbeat.",

Tasty each. \u00a0The only downer is, even though the special is all you can eat, the service is very very slow and we werent able to take advantage (or eat as much as we would have err...hoped to). \u00a0All in all, it was a good experience and the massive beers make this place worthy of a trip back.",

    "text": "This was my first time at The Big Easy and (honest bit now) I'm not a fan of BBQ or Seafood. However I thought I'd give it a go. It's always good to experience new things and you never know you may end up liking something different. We arrived at our allotted time but were told to stand at the bar for about 30 mins. I'm not sure why as our table had always been empty (I have a habit of looking at the space whenever I walk into somewhere). It took a while to order and most of us ordered the All-You-Can-Eat BBQ. Ribs, chopped pork, chicken with sides of BBQ beans, coleslaw & chips. It also comes with beer, but very hard to order something else if you don't drink beer. The food portions where humongous. And the food was good. I really enjoyed it and as a non fan that (hopefully) says more. They do provide take away containers for the food we couldn't eat which was also a plus. Lastly the decor and ambience is different. I really like the feel of the place. The toilets are hidden away on the basement floor and you do have to pass low lighting an go through a zigzag of tables.",

As a southern american im not into making bbq and other things into a dining experience that is so expensive you kind of cringe. I got the seafood caddyshack plate but it was essentially one shrimp, lots of oysters and some crab claws in sauce for nearly 20\u00a3. I don't think you should lump all this seafood together as only really mussels would be steamed in sauce. I had to order the side of Mac and cheese to feel full which was rich but at least not offensive. I also ordered the big easy beer and honestly I think it's MillerHigh Life.",

    "text": "Lots of deals but only available Mondays to Fridays. \u00a0On Sundays, only the Lobster Fest is available, which is either a whole lobster or a lobster roll with salad and chips, and an alcoholic slushie, for double the price you would pay during the week, at \u00a320. Therefore, considering you get the same at a lower price during the week, it is not good value. \u00a0Very disappointing too, as the lobster roll was actually a soggy cold toasted sandwich, a few leaves of rocket for the salad and a small tin bucket of overdone chips. I always feel let down by lobsters cooked by Westerners, when you can get a nourishing meal of lobsters and noodles, cooked the Chinese way, with so much taste and just so much more yummy and meatier. The only other lobster meal that matched it is Bob's Lobsters. There were six of us in our party, three had the lobster roll and two had the whole lobster, which was not that fresh, and we were all left feeling still hungry, whereas one who actually checked what the Lobster Fest includes made a different choice as it did not sound filling and ordered the BBQ meats, which was extremely filling, but unfortunately, they were all burnt and overdone and very dry. We then had some waffles with ice cream for dessert, which was nice, but nothing special.It is not as busy as the Chelsea branch, which is always heaving, and the bar is positively empty. \u00a0Perhaps, because it is Sunday, and also no happy hour! \u00a0A disappointing experience here, especially compared to the Chelsea branch the portions there are positively huge and everything is much fresher, the atmosphere is heaving, but service is still quick, friendly.",
