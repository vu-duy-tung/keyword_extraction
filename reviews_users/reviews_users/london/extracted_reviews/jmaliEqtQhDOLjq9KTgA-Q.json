Don't get me wrong, Nandos is delicious, but there are so many amazing food options in Soho that I try to avoid chains. Sometimes a girl just needs some chicken when she's drunk, OKAY? This place is clean and well kept and you can usually grab a table with friends without too much trouble. If you're looking for something fast and easy and your mom's not available (heyooo!), Nandos has your back.",

I was a bit baffled by the \"order at the counter\" concept, as I only know it from english pubs, with low expectations to the food. The menu looks enticing enough and had many different options. I decided to go for the portobello mushroom burger with haloumi, also know as squeaky cheese, plus some macho peas ... just because I wanted to see macho peas. Its peas with chili. As usual with the term macho it did not deliver...not enough spice. Also ... to my eternal shame ... I was so busy chatting and having fun, so I did not notice that my burger came without the squeaky cheese. How could I not notice?! Its still a mystery to me. To many interesting talk thread going on around the table. I'm not really a fan of this concept, as nothing has blown me away taste wise and the whole \"order at the counter and help yourself to cutlery\" is not really helping.",

This Nandos has the typical Nandos look inside, if you are in the area and want some comfort food, head here :)",

We arrived when they opened, so it was pretty empty, and we were greeted by a very nice gentleman who then told us that we could sit down first, but then would need to order at the front. Sauces and drinks are to the side, so you can grab whatever sauce you'd like, and if you buy a drink, they all come with unlimited refills! Woot! Hubby and I were going to get the meal for 2, but decided to be a bit healthier and instead got the boneless chicken thighs plus sides, and a Caesar salad. The chicken meat was tender and not dry. Yay! My husband really liked both of the sauces that he had grabbed from the sauce table, but I was so so about them. As for sides, we had picked the mashed potatoes (yummy) and the garlic bread (pretty good at first, but then not as tasty when cooled). The salad was really really good. For some reason, I've had a hard time finding salad in London, so this satisfied my craving for a simple Caesar salad. Overall, happy with the experience and I'll be back. Really liked the service and it seems easy to order for take out so that my husband can grab something quick to bring home as well.",

It is important that when you come to order something with chicken because that IS their signature.However, they do have a few vegetarian options for all y'all veggies so no worries. Their sauces are awesome and a must try while you visit! If you aren't a fan of too hot or spicy flavors I will warn that even the mild sauces have quite a kick to it!

They recommended Nando's to me.I was very excited to go to Nando's because I have NOT heard anything negative about Nando's from anyone I know who has eaten there. Everyone has told me that I would be happy and satisfied.Nando's is a South Africa chicken chain restaurant that has Portgugese influences. Unfortunately, ther is no Nando's restaurants in near me. According to Wikipedia, Nando's opened its first United States location in 2008 in Washington, D.C. Nando's currently has over 30 restaurants in the US: seven in the Chicago area, four in Washington, D.C.; thirteen in Maryland; and six in Virginia. Nando's, please come to Atlanta. Nando's is casual fast food. You order up front and you will take a number to your table and they will bring out your food to you.With that being said. Nando's was everything and plus some. The chicken is very flavorful, juicy, with a crispy char exterior. I ordered the boneless thighs cause it just taste better. It came with four pieces so I was surprised. You get to choose your heat level too and since I love spicy food, I got the spiciest but of course, it was just mild to me. Two side items - chips (fries for us Americans) & a healthy quinoa salad (I know to offset the fries I got). What makes Nando's special also are the sauces! So freaking good. I loved Nando's so much that I headed the supermarket and bought the marinade. I didn't get the sauces cause I thought I couldn't take it on the plane with me. I regret not getting them. I got home and marinated boneles chicken thighs and chargoal grilled them a few days later. It did not disappoint. Now I have to learn to perfect the recipe.",

Nando's is nothing extra ordinary but at the same time.. It is. It is food one can whip up on the BBQ on a nice sunny day given that they now sell their sauces in various store including Costco. But why is going to Nando's still so great?! Is it the fact that we don't have to ask for the bill after stuffing our faces with chicken, corn, mash potatoes and fries and wiping off the sweat we have falling off our foreheads from the slightly spicy (or very spicy to some) food?What ever the answer or excuse if you will, Nando's is still a great place to grab some over priced chicken with people who share similar interests with you.. That is picking which sauce to go for and their love for chicken... This particular Nando's is designed nicely and split into two floors each with an ordering bar and in the bottom floor sits more comfy booths and dim lights. If you are not a Londoner, start getting used to people saying \"A Cheeky Nando's on a Friday?\" or \"A Cheeky Nando's? It's Pay Day!\"In all honesty, there are definitly other places to go for good and low cost chicken but Nando's is a guilty pleasure so Happy Chicken-ing!",

Even though it was an odd time of day, the downstairs dining area was buzzing. We ordered the boneless chicken thighs, medium with macho peas and salted chips. Thighs, even without the bone were juicy with a tasty skin and a slight punch of heat. Covering it with garlic peri peris sauce put it over the moon. Matcha peas were a bit on the dry side and the chips were pretty standard. But the chicken is amazing and I'm pretty sure every trip to London will include a visit to nandos.",

You arrive at Nando's, a place of delicious goodness. 2. Your host/hostess will seat you. You will be given a table number and a menu. 3. Peruse the menu and decide what you want (ALL THE CHICKEN). 4. Here's the tricky part. No one takes your order! You must get up, go to the counter, tell the cashier your table number, order your food, and pay. 5. After ordering, you collect your cutlery, sauces, drinks, etc. at a another counter. 6. Return to your table and wait. 7. Your food will be delivered to your table. p.s. free refills for us american fatties!! yassss!",

However, this thread may help to explain how this unlikely UYE came to be (yelp.co.uk/events/london\u2026)The Nandos revolution has swept across the UK in the last few years with their simple brand of griddled peri peri chicken in 5 different sauces. It's reliable if a little corporate and formulaicThis Soho branch has a little more character though with a nice basement. We managed to get a nice corner booth with comfy sofa style seating for our party of 8. We ordered at the counter and the food was delivered quickly even if one of the vegetarian burgers was missing the advertised halloumi cheese - this error was quickly and professionally rectifiedAs always, my chicken leg was a bit on the small side but it had flavourWhat made the afternoon special was the chat with good Yelp friends with topics ranging from the sugar in Sunkist drinks to finding out that one of our party was a professional session drummer to trying to set up some cultural UYEs in the near future",

    "text": "Pouring rain and completely famished. How am I going to say no to a whole seasoned chicken and a giant basket of chips!? Of course not!We randomly discovered Nando's a side street off Oxford and discovered \u00a0Portuguese deliciousness. They have an interesting concept of seating where you are seated by the hostess, then order at the counter and then a server brings out your food. Odd combo of service, but hey, it was great food and everyone was very friendly. Nando's is obviously known for their spicy, seasoned whole chickens and giant sides like chips, mashed potatoes, and mashed peas. To those of us in the U.S., it was like Buffalo Wild Wings meets Portuguese and British cuisine.We ordered between the two of us a whole Peri-Peri seasoned chicken and a giant basket of chips. ( I know, I know. This vacation is starting to sound REAL healthy). We ordered the medium level spice which ended up being perfect. It was tangy with just enough kick to leave your craving your drink without burning or being overwhelming. And even though we didn't have a traditional server, everyone was so nice and kept swinging by our table and checking on us to make sure it was going well. The place we pretty packed both upstairs and downstairs so it seemed to be a quite popular place.This would probably have to my first experience with Portuguese cuisine and it was sort of without knowing until halfway through the meal. I definitely enjoyed the meal and with all the spice, I definitely was glad they had fountain sodas and teas. This was the only place is the UK that I saw fountain sodas outside of fast food. Overall, great food and cool service, solid 4 stars!",

    "text": "I must admit, that under normal circumstances I would not go to a Nandos any more.However, under the circumstances of the crazy Yelp talk thread that ensued after a lovely headless man named Sutnam decided to invite some of the lovely ladies of Yelp for free chicken (as long as they ensured no other men would be coming), Yee Gan O created an actual event and I felt the need to indulge.There was a time when I did enjoy going to Nandos for some chickeny goodness. However, those days have long gone. I know that there has been inflation in this country, but I seem to remember what used to cost 5 or 6 Pounds will now cost you \u00a310 upwards. I have no problem with this, because it shows Nandos are doing well for themselves and their popularity speaks for itself. However, I am fortunate enough to live in a place where reasonably priced food is available to me anywhere I go. Therefore, this leaves Nandos as being an average tasting, slightly overpriced option.I must say that this branch of Nandos is fairly well turned out with its modern, sleek yet cosy design and split-level design.Where I did feel let down was when the food arrived, I had chosen to go for what they refer to as 1/2 chicken, I tucked into the first 1/2, which would be a 1/4(!), only to discover that the second 1/2 that they had put on my plate was very much lacking in meat, well almost non-existent! It was pretty much just the bones and some skin and peri-peri sauce.Once again, I had been somewhat let down by the quality of Nando's food versus the value for money aspect.Doubtless, there are many dashing young gentlemen, the length and breadth of this grey and peasant land, who love taking their special lady for a night of Nandos. I, on the other hand, am not one of those men.Even worse - No Sutnam!Here's the thread - yelp.com/topic/london-an\u2026",
