Not one of them got back to me. If you're looking to book out an area for an event, I'd go elsewhere. And because of that, I didn't come here as quickly as I would have, I was just totally unconvinced by their service. So I came, I saw and I liked. I'm still not convinced by the place. Don't get me wrong, great venue, cool ping pong tables. Nice enough staff. But a \u00a310 minimum is always going to piss me off (especially when I'm not told in advance despite holding a card). I don't like the high minimum spends. We're not in the dark ages and it basically stops people drinking on their own. I wasn't, but I did have to wait until my date arrived before I bought a drink. The wine was alright, I wasn't fussed. I don't actually get what all the fuss is about. I'm sure if you come here for an event it's fun. The place is nice (and would be nicer if they tidied up a bit and cleared some tables). Thing is, I won't recommend them to anyone for an event, and I'd already decided that I'd dock a star because of their incompetence earlier in the year. It's left a really bad taste in my mouth and the bar just isn't awesome enough for me to forget it.",

They've got a regular menu of events from poetry and philosophy to music and networking. It also appears to be quite a decent bar. Obviously it's less easy to judge that in the cold light of day...Neat little brunch menu, the scrambled eggs were particularly fine!",

Entry was \u00a310 each to get in, which, considering the size of the place, was ridiculous.There are two floors, each with a bar. Drinks were reasonably priced, but the queues for the bar were so long and chaotic, we didnt bother at times.The downstairs area is the main dance area. Its quite small, which is fine, but theres a pool table in the middle of nowhere so it can get annoying and crowded if a group decide to play.The bouncers can be quite rude, with one particular scary looking woman screaming at you to get out the way, or to show your stamp everytime you want to go upstairs/downstairs.Three stars because drinks were ok, and the djs were really enthusiastic.",

    "text": "We stumbled upon this place after walking around Shoreditch in search of a pho joint. Though most places were closed, the Book Club beckoned with it's ping pong table, kitschy decor, and the promise of food. \u00a0There's also a pool table downstairs and a space for shows.The ambiance was good, with a relaxed vibe, and the service was pretty good -- fast and friendly enough. \u00a0In the tradition of English pubs, food and drink orders are placed at the bar, where you pay on the spot. \u00a0We ordered a couple of beers, the roast dinner (can't remember what meat), veggie full English breakfast, and a side of pork scratchings. \u00a0 \u00a0 The pork scratchings were alright, but nothing to write home about. \u00a0They tasted like they were straight from a bag, but still...they were crunchy and salty enough to satisfy my junk food craving. \u00a0And, I'm partial to crackling. Loved the veggie full English breakfast. The soy based sausages reminded me a bit of those from Rosamunde in SF, but a little tastier, and the hashbrowns were perfect, crispy golden chunks of goodness. \u00a0According to my other half, the same couldn't be said about the roast dinner; the meat wasn't moist and the flavor wasn't as good as a typical roast. \u00a0In all, still a pretty solid-ish place. \u00a0I'm giving this a four because...well, because of the ping pong. Who doesn't like a game after a few beers?I'd definitely go back to try other things on their menu. \u00a0Even if not for the food, I'd hit up Book Club again for a cold beer, \u00a0some ping pong/ pool action, or catch a show.",

The food is also surprisingly good with awesome international sharing platters at reasonable prices. Lovely stuff for all the Shoreditch types",

The first was on one of their \"Thinking and Drinking\" nights where for a fiver I got to have a play with a robot hand as well as a glass of wine. The second was a Friday night out (free entry before 9) and had a great time. Upstairs the table tennis keeps on going while downstairs there's a pool table, as well as a DJ and dance floor. Very cool - over the dance floor the ceiling is made of light bulbs - I don't think picking up a mate on the dance floor is a good idea. It's the kind of place that you can go early and stay through to the early hours without ever feeling out of place. Had a wicked time and looking forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "One of the great things about Shoreditch is that there are tonnes of great places for one to hang out, whether it's day or night. And the only thing similar about each of these venues is that they all offer something different. I suspect I might not be explaining myself all that well, but if you're a regular in this part of town, I hope you get what I mean. T.B.C., I'm happy to say, is the same as the other clubs in the area in its different-ness. What other place here - or in London - has a room dedicated to table tennis? From what I can tell, this room is in use regularly, although it's safe to say I won't be partaking in this. For one thing, my grip is very loose when I'm sober, so there's no telling who'll get hurt if I'm even slightly intoxicated, and, more importantly, I'm ethnic Chinese, so I'd be risking the reputation of my forefathers if I end up losing, never mind that I've never actually played before. T.B.C. has two areas: the upstairs dining area where the table tennis is, and the downstairs DJ and dance area, where you'll find a room with a shelf full of books (hence, the name). I didn't get a close look at the books, but I did see some people returning some tomes, which, in my opinion, makes this place that much cooler. I love places which provide books for you to while away the time. It just feels so welcoming and relaxing. There's also a pool table here in case you haven't yet found something to keep you busy. The furniture here seems cobbled together in that it's almost artistically mismatched. I'm not sure if it worked too well in the dining area; from where I was sitting (a comfy sofa located by the entrance so I'd get hit by blasts of cold air every time someone entered), some of the seats - or rather benches - looked rather uncomfortable. In contrast, the basement gave off an Ikea-cafe- meets-speakeasy feel. The ceiling of the bar in the basement was essentially a net full of light bulbs, which made me very nervous as a couple of them looked as if they might fall. There're quite a few events going on at this venue, and it's safe to say I'll definitely be back to check them out some time in the near future. Just as a last note, T.B.C. is owned by the same people who own The Queen of Hoxton, which is another really cool Shoreditch hang-out, so it's safe to say these guys have some experience of knowing what makes a club a great place to be.",

In a way it deteriorated as the night went on, 20-minute wait to get a drink, toilets were dirty (and I'm honestly not a fan of the unisex loo option) music getting lounder and more random (s-express got my attention but there were some very dodgy moments as well)Cocktails were from \u00a36.95 - \u00a38.00ish, which is fairly cheap for this area. Liked the decor, tiled walls, quite open-plan, a thumping dark dancefloor downstairs whith different music and a ping-pong table in the rear.I've actually heard it's a lovely place to come in the daytime for brunch etc so that sounds more like my scene.

There's no doubting that this place is firm hipster territory, there's a lot of them here but it doesn't mean you have to be a hipster to enjoy it. I came for lunch here with my friend on a weekday afternoon and we managed to get a decent window seat with no wait. The d\u00e9cor is very nice, wooden furniture, exposed brick walls, there's big black and white prints up all around and the large windows ensure it's nice and light. The menu is pretty solid, I had ham, egg and chips. Sorry, I mean I had hand-cured honey ham, free-range egg and home-made crispy chipped potatoes. And my friend had vegetarian lasagne which was, actually, advertised as just \"vegetarian lasagne\" in their credit. Ours both came in around the \u00a37-8 mark for a main meal and it arrived really quickly, literally about 10 minutes after we ordered. I have to say it was really good, solid food. The chips were amazing, properly crispy, the egg was cooked perfectly and the ham was in big slabs and they weren't short on portions either.I can't say anything about the drinks as we had tap water from the iced jugs on the bar (extra kudos for that) and neither can I say anything about this place in the evening. There's a ping-pong table at the back near the toilets which I gather is home to a tournament and there were paddles and balls out so we could have played if we'd wanted to. I loved the way the seating was arranged with tables and communal benches but plenty of room to move around so you're not smacking people in the face with your uber-trendy canvas bags when you're trying to leave. I also thought the staff were quite friendly for a hipster-orientated establishment. All in all I'll give this place 4 stars based on this one visit. I think we might have been lucky or maybe it's always this good. It's somewhere I want to take people in the future and be all \"oh yeah, I heard about this place from a friend\" about.",

First thing...I was impressed that to gain entrance we didn't have to pay but to offer up an email address. Slightly annoying but a damn good idea from a marketing perspective. Upon entering the space we were greeted with a perfectly lit room filled with young, (mostly) attractive professionals engaging in spirited conversation. We ordered at the bar which is where you also order food. I partook in a shot special and a few beers. Played some table tennis, chatted with my friends and generally had a great time. The bars in london in many cases are very fashionable, as was Book Club. But it also had something else that made it comfortable and warranted a fifth star. Bonus for the nice bathrooms.Great place. Check it out.",

The highlights: friendly bartenders who knew what they were doing, very easy to get to/from, an interesting space for a bar. Cons: there isn't very much seating, and as we were with a group of 11 it took a while before everyone had a chair. Additionally, it was unclear as to how ordering food was meant to take place. All in all, I would go again but maybe during the daytime.",

    "text": "I wanted to review the Literary Death Match, but can't work out how to. Instead, it's location gets a shout out!Our friend Olly has been going about the Literary Death Match for months. Cast your mind back to 8 Mile, with Eminem chickening out the first time he has to battle that super-confident rapper with dreads. Remember? Well, it's that like (the founder is from Brooklyn after all) - but with prose, comedy and poetry. Though it's been held in London before. Last Wednesday's event was for the first time held at The Book Club in Shoreditch - which in itself was lovely. A two-floored hideaway with a neon-lit bar up top (we had food afterwards, a hot & cold meze platter big enough for three costs \u00a312 and we bulked it up with some extra wedges). Anyway, nice nibbles aside, the basement was the location for the 'match'.We arrived and I was distracted by the lightbulb ceiling (made entirely from lightbulbs pinned to the wooden beams) for a good ten minutes. 150 people ended up crushing in, and off we went.Round 1. Two contestants with seven minutes each to read any type of literature. Both are then judged by the panel of three (last night, it was singer/artist Molly Carroll tasked on 'intangibles', tv presenter/actress Emma Kennedy on performance and Rising Magazine's Tim Wells on form). \u00a0A winner is then announced, and then after round two - a final. This time around, it consisted on throwing Cadbury Cr\u00e8me Eggs through holes cut out of British authors faces. Bizarre. I would have liked to have seen some kind of improvisation instead.Anyway, it was bloody good fun and I'll definitely go again. Seven minutes seems to be the perfect length of time to hold a room's attention and it's a really unique type of event to go to.The LDM's are held all around the world, so check literarydeathmatch.com for more details.",

With a huge space, regular talks and lectures as well as a ping pong table, The Book Club deserves to survive.I came here for tea and cake over the weekend and was impressed with a tasty apple tart and super friendly Shoreditch Twats serving me. There were a few couples snuggled in corners brunching and a large group of people in the middle all around one table having breakfast. Even though there were people there the place just seemed empty, apparently it's always like this during the day so potentially a great place to get some solid reading done or get on with work.Thomas W is fair with his 3 stars but i think I would make this spot a regular haunt, so i'm going to throw 4 at it.",

I do not like wearing things that clutch to my skin, my sun glasses fit my face, and i do not have Top Shop/man buyers stalking me on the street trying to get an idea of what the next seasons, scene fashion fix will be! I never thought i would feel so at home at the Book Club, but then again, how can you not? The furniture is charming, comfy and different! It really compliments the relaxing and opposingly lively environment that the Book Club creates.The last time i was there, i took a date. I was very cautious about this at first, as well, i did not know what to expect - and well i wanted to impress the girl! Whatever initial scepticism i had \u00a0vanished as soon as we went downstairs to shoot a couple of rounds of pool (great for flirtation!) But my god, what is wrong with London?! This is possibly the only bar i have been to in the whole of London that has a pool table! What the hell is that all about? I am a Northerner for gods sake, it has come to be an expectation of going out for a drink!Now after a bit of pool, we headed upstairs to have a few more drinks. The music is pretty standard for the area, but for London as a whole is pretty good! I do not remember hearing anything particularly rare, but it was certainly all tasteful. Heading upstairs, we had a few rounds of table tennis with an American couple (who we destroyed) Where else in London can you play table tennis? This bar is legendary for this reason alone!The bar also has a really large underground space and while we were there was some kind of hip hop gig on. The acoustics were great and while it was quite loud, you could quite happily escape the noise and cosy up on a sofa next door to talk. Great night, lovely service, nice people, table tennis.",

They supposedly open at 8am but more often than not I'm not able to order food at 8:30 or 8:45 because the chef hasn't shown up yet. This morning I walked up to place an order and the server asked me what I'd like and I ordered some food and she said the kitchen wasn't open yet, so I ordered some coffee and she said the coffee machine has been broken for a few days. After confirming that there was actually nothing I could order unless I wanted a cocktail at 8:30 in the morning I left.  You order food from the bar but there are no signs to that effect and the staff do not bother to mention it so I've made somewhat of a sport of watching people come in, sit down and look increasingly frustrated and confused until they either get up and walk out, or walk up to the bar and ask for a server at which point they are informed that they should be ordering at the bar and stared at incredulously by the staff as if they should have known that. Even when the place is nearly empty it can take 10 minutes to get a cup of coffee and it is delivered to the table with an air of extreme inconvenience. \u00a0If the food wasn't so good (when you can get it) and the wifi free I'd find somewhere else to eat breakfast.",

They serve quickly and don't mind helping you if decision-making is a skill you were born without. \u00a0Free wifi is always a bonus, as is a creative approach to interior design. \u00a0While it may seem a bit odd, my favourite part of The Book Club is that it isn't crammed full of tables - you actually have room to yourself; a rarity in this city.",

    "text": "Fulll review and photos at thehappinessprojectlondo\u2026  I shuddered slightly on my way into The Book Club in Shoreditch (just across the road from the Great Eastern Dining Room), because it used to be home to Home \u00a0one of the wankiest restaurants I've ever been to in London. I may have judged it a little harshly as it was my first meal in London after moving from Brussels where restos served great food on the cheap. I couldn't believe how much we paid for crap service and mediocre food, but then again I was spoiled Anyway, its now The Book Club, run by the same guys who do the Queen of Hoxton, and with a much nicer, friendlier atmosphere and a lovely bright and airy venue. The kind of place you can order a bottle of wine and Monopoly and chill out. The real gem of this place was the ping pong room. Yes, not just a table, a room. We went there on Tuesday night for Pippalippa's birthday when they hold a ping pong league there. You can just rock up and play, but by the personalised bats and serious faces, the league isn't really for tipsy amateurs like ourselves. Once the league games were over (about 9pm ish), filled with wine and sharing plates of fajitas and nachos, we managed to get on the tables. Pipalippa and I have something else in common \u00a0a previous history of taking ping pong very seriously. Aged 10-ish, I was enrolled on a week-long ping pong course in the Summer holidays (I have to thank my mother for imaginative yet random school holiday ideas), which meant I'm actually pretty shit-hot at smashes, backhand lunges and similar. Although I now realise that my 10-year-old sober self can probably play a lot better than my 30-something self after a few glasses of vino, oops. The photo below is typical of our games \u00a0which were mostly spent rescuing the ball from the floor/roof/people's pints etc. I had lots of fun and would certainly return for a few more games \u00a0and you can hire the ping pong table if you're in a group.",

The staff are really friendly and all of the food and drinks are of high quality, all while not breaking the budget.",

    "text": "The Book Club is slowly becoming my go-to bar when I'm in and around the Shoreditch area. The best places to be seen and heard in change on almost a weekly basis in this area, but with the BC you have a really comfortable space to enjoy a few drinks. I've found it really suits every type of night, easily could enjoyably knock them back for that big night out, a lovely place for a quiet one on a Sunday and also an excellent spot for some drinks before running off for a nice meal. The bar is very well stocked, loads of options in the beer and cider departments and also some very good wines that compliment the food menu (which i'm yet to try, this will change soon). BC also have some excellent spirits, great gin is a highlight, and also a unique cocktail list. On my last visit I had a very cool twist on an old fashioned where tequila replaced the whiskey. Ok, it's something that would make Whiskey lovers revolt but as I love tequila and can't develop my taste buds enough to cope with whiskey, it was a pure delight. Fresh and also VERY more-ish. I'll let you decide if that's a good thing or not. (No, it is).BC put on a lot of cool events and there's a huge event space and extra bar downstairs that see a lot of gigs, talks and various other cool things to do. Can't remember who played but I went to a hip-hop night here a few months back and it was great, only a 5er to get in too! Other great things here include the staff, the decor and wait for it...THE PING PONG TABLE, YES! It does get busy as there's only one but beers and ping pong is up there with PB&J and Spaghetti and Meatballs. Great spot that I'd more than recommend checking out and if all else fails you can laugh at people bewilderment when they discover the Unisex toilets! BC, BC, BC!",

    "text": "I've been to some really nice spots in London, but was lookin for a chill location to continue writing and hopefully finish my book. \u00a0I found out about The Book Club by doing a Google search for \"great places to write in London\". \u00a0Boy was this recommendation accurate! \u00a0It was a little difficult to find walking from the Liverpool Street tube station, but well worth the hassle. \u00a0It's officially one of my favorite spots in London. \u00a0I hate to write that because what I like about it would be ruined if you had to queue up outside.The interior is full of natural light from the giant picture windows that look out into a nondescript little alley. \u00a0The alley sounds horrible, but there is some art grafitti on the brick wall across the way and people constantly passing outside. \u00a0Inside, the walls are brick, painted white and bright with black words in cursive to add interest. \u00a0There are also books hanging on the wall and some really phenomenal art pieces, plus modern folk style green plants in terra-cotta pots on the wall. \u00a0The internal ambiance is amplified by the choice of indie rock and old school r&b and pop tunes (think Michael Jackson in his younger days). \u00a0I should probably add that I was the only one working who had a PC instead of a MAC, and that the choice of male attire was the modern pantaloon a.k.a. skinny jeans. \u00a0I didnt mind either way. \u00a0The MAC is on my dream list and the pants increased my viewing pleasure. \u00a0As for the food, well, it's organic, with some choice vegetarian items, but of course I had ham, free-range eggs, and chips (french fries). \u00a0My meal was delicious! \u00a0And to top it off they have a full bar and coffee bar. \u00a0Its like mom's modern farm kitchen if it had a bar and coffee shop. \u00a0Good grief, I've become effusive! \u00a0I can't say enough good things here. \u00a0I will be back, maybe daily, while I'm in London this month. \u00a0In a place like this I'm actually inspired that my labor will yield fruit. \u00a0Dallas, are you paying attention? \u00a0You need a place like this.",

It's good for creativity and just staring off blankly into the distance.If you come in the morning though, you'll probably want to leave by lunch when all the tables fill up and you start getting looks at your empty space with two finished coffee mugs. They also reserve out tables in the afternoon and evening for reservations and events, so the freely available tables decrease as the day goes on.",

We met in the afternoon and the place was nicely busy with various groups of happy people. The space is open and there was plenty of seating in small tables and on the large mess hall type benches near the bar and kitchen. I liked the large windows at the from of the place and the fact they had a ping pong table in the corner.The staff were casual and friendly. We loved it here so much we stayed on for lunch. We got two beef brisket burgers with additional cheese and bacon, which were served with crispy onion rings, and a steak sandwich which was swerved with chips. Both choices were really tasty and cane promptly.I'd definitely recommend you come here by yourself to study/work, on a date or in a group as there seemed to be all these types of groups enjoying themselves in the relaxed atmosphere. I hear they also do club nights and all sorts of arty things here too!",

    "text": "We were looking for a spot to grab brunch. One spot kept coming up, the Book Club. Needless to say it was a welcome surprise to find some pretty tasty bites in a restaurant/art gallery/co-working space. Needless to say, they served up some pretty impressive bites in a very cool and different space.Let me start off with the space. It is simple. Open. Comfortable. It offers a good variety of space for both small groups and large parties. It is bright and showcases a rotating series of art that liven up the space and make it rather relatable. The menu is straight forward. It isn't complex and it doesn't try to be something it is not. The eggs benedict was pretty respectable with a very well prepared poached eggs topping some ham and an english muffin. The hollandaise was well done and not too heavy and the basil and pepper finishing off the flavors and brought balance. Americans beware, bacon in the UK is not bacon in the US.Definitely check it out if you are in the neighborhood. It is offering a pretty respectable breakfast (and morning cocktails) in a very awesome area of town that is showing London can be different.",

However, when I came here it wasn't quite what I was expecting. The upstairs bar is quite small and the toilets were a little on the rough side. I didn't venture downstairs, but maybe that's where the fun is. Upstairs is light but the table was sat at was too small for the chairs and the music was too loud, it was hard to hear what people were saying. For a place which is supposed to be chilled out and social, I didn't feel like it lived up to either description. Am I missing something here?",

What's great: Good vibes, free Wifi attracting workaholics and hypster kids.What's not: It gets busy at night, especially when there's some event and you could dry out waiting for drinks. By DayIdeal for getting some drinks, making photos of lattes and chilling. The coffee bar and the morning menu make me feel like at mom's house - if she had a bar. The burgers are good, not the best I've tried, but still pretty good. I've been willing to try their freshly made cakes for a long time. You can even play ping pong if you feel like moving and sweating, which is not my favourite thing, but it's still very cool for a cafe. By NightWhen the sun goes down, a crowd of \u00a0aggressive party people appears out of nowhere and the place gets so crowded, you'll sweat your ass off. There's a program of events like live art, music and films. They encourage creative and talented people to share their skills which is the main reason I like this place so much.On weekends, the place becomes more of a nightclub, with local and national DJs. What to expect: Great music, party girls and drunk guys.Also: \u00a0Drunk boyfriends may appear, be aware!",

Had a cappuccino to start with and felt a bit hungry so I decided to try the burger with fries. Both good, but fries weren't hand cut and the burger was a bit 'simple'. Meat was perfect, tasty and juicy though. Also great, they have tab water with cucumber, really refreshing. Seems to be a great place for cocktails too as I saw them put a lot of effort into them. Also a great place to get yourself distracted for a while playing table tennis with friends. I'll definitely be back, also to check out what the place looks like in the evenings, looks like a great place to have some wine and a dance with some friends.",

    "text": "We went to the Book Club on Saturday night. There was about a 20 minute wait to get in, which is fine really, but it was extremely hot inside and it was packed to the rafters with painfully cool hipsters (to be expected in the area). Entry was \u00a35 and drinks weren't too badly priced. The decor is pretty nice, I like the open plan of the upstairs room and the light-bulbed ceiling downstairs is striking. They had an amazing band playing downstairs as well, we were twisting the night away to the rockabilly tunes (I have no idea if those two things are from the same era). Overall, a fun, reasonably priced place that I would to go to for a dance rather than to try to chat with friends.",

The bouncers in question are the worst kind too, who seem to think they are working outside the Palais in Essex circa 1992.Forget the ping pong, there is one table and you won't get a game. The food is poor, drinks ove- priced and the music sh*te.Decor is quite cool though.",

Kitchen canteen-y upstairs, light bulb ceiling downstairs, this venue compels me to whip out the disco stick and leaves me begging for more and more.

Looked like there was a good ping pong game going on around the corner from the dining area as well. Bar staff were lovely and friendly and food was great (did I mention french toast is only 3.50?!)",

The dishes of food eaten by customers in the evening however always seem to be on the tables until midnight just festering. Interesting decor, done on the cheap like shabby chic style and then with standard trendy prices. Prices weren't on the whole too high to be fair. A fiver get in though. It's nice that there is a ping pong table and pool table. Gives you something to do if you're not getting completely pissed silly. The bouncers were alright but racial profiling. Concerned about Algerians one told me in a jovial tone.",
