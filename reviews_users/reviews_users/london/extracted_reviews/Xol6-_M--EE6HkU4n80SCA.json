    "text": "Prezzo in Mayfair is in a funky old buliding that looks like a cross between a church and a Tudor restaurant. The style is very unusual but it definitely makes it more unique than the other Prezzos. The food is a slightly upmarket pizza and pasta joint. The pizza is nice but the menu doesn't really change so if you eat there too often, you get sick of it. Also, if you take away then there is 2 for 1 on pizza. Update in June 2009Visited after a 8 month absence. Nothing much had changed, however the waitress arbitrarily decided to add a massive tip to the bill (without me knowing) and just handing me the credit card terminal to enter my PIN. She did not deserve a 25+% tip and I didn't notice it til too late. Not impressed",

I can eat better Italian sauce from a jar in a US supermarket!HORRIBLE.",

The food is also great value - especially considering where you are in central London. Not too pricey at all.Definitely recommend it!",

Again, the saffron sauce was great, and you can't go wrong with lobster and crab.The \u00a0wine menu was nice, and I liked that you could get varying size glasses. The servers were kind and helpful. \u00a0The art was a little odd, but the restaurant had a nice cozy vibe. \u00a0Overall this wasn't the most exciting Italian food I've ever had, but it might be the best chain Italian I've had. \u00a0I absolutely wouldn't complain if you told me I'd be taking a repeat visit to Prezzo.",

So while the ground floor area can get busy the top floor is always very relaxed and empty, but with good service nonetheless. I would advise to be careful with the pasta dishes as they are not prepared per order, but seem to be microwaved and therefore the food on the centre of the plate can be quite cold. I would opt for a pizza or a salad instead :)",

I like the both the interior and the exterior design of this particular Prezzo, it somehow looks like a old barn house, but with a lot of paintings hanging around. I like the atmosphere created by the dim lighting and candles, with that, you tend to relax and dip yourselves inside the comfortable eating mood. However, I would say the food isn't too great, particular for the Spaghetti Carbonara, the cause was too thick and greasy plus the ham on top was too hard and too dry and too salty. Risotto was nice but not taste like genuine Italian cuisine, I understand hat's always the case for chain restaurant, as they need to alter to suit locals and the market.",

    "text": "Typical London customer service.(i.e. None) Only one server for the whole place. He sits us, then we wait over 8 min for him to come back to ask if we're ready to order. Didn't even ask for a drink order or bring water. We put in our entire order, then he proceeds to go and bus a few tables. Takes another 8 min just to get drinks. Wine glass came with a sticky substance on the rim. At this point, we're praying that the food will stand up to the high review standard. Nope. Spaghetti and Giant Meatballs - not even sauce to coat the parts, spaghetti not al dente, meatballs dry (though tasty). Pizza tri gusti - uncut (Fine, I'll do the work. But don't give me a dull pizza cutter.), very dry, no sauce, not tasty. Hugely disappointed in the pizza and anyone that says it's delicious has never been to the US, or Italy for that matter.The only reason it's not one star is because it's a nice place, cute building, food wasn't inedible (just not good). 1.5 stars.",

A healthy pour of wine is just the cherry on top. They were also very accommodating...allowing us to order a large pizza after the kitchen had closed. Highly recommend.",

The waitress had a limited knowledge of English and could not grasp the idea of water with a slice of lemon. Rather, we were given some sort of flavors soda which she argued was in fact water. We ordered the light goat cheese and Auvergne pizza along with the penne arrabiatta. Both were tasty. No one ever approached us to check on the quality of the food or to top up our water glasses. Go for a quick bite and know that service will require that you are visible.",

I have never actually eaten at a Prezzo without using these vouchers because they're so damn good!! Because I've been to ths chain so many times I'm familiar with their menu but it's good that they always change it up. It took us forever to decide what to choose as it all sounded amazing. In the end we opted for some olives and the grilled goats cheese and deep-fried mozarella for starters. I then had the chicken and asparagus risotto which was really creamy, garlicy and an all round tasty dish. My friend went for a spicy sausage pizza that neither of us could pronounce but that was apparently also very tasty. The service was okay, but not really anything to report on. The actual restaurant was tiny inside but with nice decor. You'd expect it to be bigger for picadilly circus as lots of people were having to wait for tables towards the end. For all of this food, we only had to pay for the \u00a315 bottle of wine which wasn't to be sneezed at. I'd highly recommend the Tesco clubcard vouchers (not that this is a review for Tesco...)",
