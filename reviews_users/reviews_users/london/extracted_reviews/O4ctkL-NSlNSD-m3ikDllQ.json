I was really disappointed. 1) the staff are so busy you get no \u00a0attention. they are ran off thier little feet pegging around, pointing people to tables, launching a menu at you, it feels like you don't have time to catch your breath! 2) the food: I just didnt think it was all that to be honest:We had prawn toasts ( hardly any prawn to be seen)Chicken Satay: chicken not seasoned and had a strange texture Chicken green curry: it was ok, probably a bit more bitter than I was expecting but okRice :perfect ( not everywhere gets this right) Sweet & Sour chicken (pretty good, but not amazing) Such a shame as others obviously have great experiences but we didn't and sadly we wont be returning.",

I must say, I have not dined in for some time, but I have been disappointed several times now with the takeaway. One the rice comes in plastic... yes, I know it might keep it stickier - but it feels so wrong paying nearly 3 pounds for something that is in plastic. Two the mains are really small for the price. I paid over 10 pounds for some prawns, there was no sauce and it really wasn't enough for a main meal. On the plus side it is quick, but maybe a little too quick (ref: rice in plastic) and I'd probably rather walk a block and wait an extra 5 mins if it meant more reliable quality and taste to boot. Now... where to go when I get a lemon grass craving?!!",

    "text": "Great little restaurant that gets very busy around lunchtime. Taste of Siam accomodated our lunchtime party of twelve with no fuss and the speedy service meant we were all fed, watered and out within an hour. The food is absolutely delicious (I'd certainly recommend the Pad Thai), comes in generous portions and, with most mains available for around \u00a35 including rice where necessary, represents really good value. The only niggle was that the service, while generally quick, was a bit erratic with one end of the table getting their drinks and food before the other had even got drinks and there were a couple of us left waiting a little too long for our food whilst the others tucked in. Will definitely be going back and the adjacent supermarket is a great touch when lunch has inspired you to try your hand at Thai food!",

    "text": "As a Sydneysider recently relocated to London, I've been going through Thai food withdrawal symptoms. It happens to most of us here apparently. So I went to Taste of Siam simply because I needed a fix and I thought that with this restaurant being attached to its own Thai grocer it may well be somewhere near authentic. I hoped the restaurant would make its own curry pastes and that there would be larp (chilli-hot, limey salad of hand-minced chicken, pork or fish), which is a particular fetish of mine. In my opinion, tom yum is the benchmark for any Thai restaurant worth its salt. This dish encapsulates what I love about Thai food: it's at once exciting and satisfying and, oddly, gives you the impression that you are being nourished in a healthful way. Perhaps it's the liberal use of herbs that purports the health-benefits, or perhaps it's the almost vindictiveness of the chilli hit in many dishes. The tom yum koong at Taste of Siam was a respectable soup. It contained slices of fresh galangal, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaf, fresh chilli and Thai basil. If the straw mushrooms were replaced with buttons, that was okay, at least the prawns were fresh and plump rather than rubbery pink tyres. And best of all, the broth wasn't made of a paste. Similarly the som tam was on a superfluous of mixed lettuce yet was hot with chilli, fresh and clean (with a minimum of dank, yet exciting, dried/salted prawns). Unfortunately mains were less on the money. I asked for a recommendation for something hot with chilli and got suggested the beef with chilli and basil - fair enough. However it turned out to be pretty bland and prepared in the manner of suburban Chinese takeaways with tenderised beef and Cantonese-style chopped onion and pepper. Which I have nothing against, just not in my Thai. Similarly the lamb mussaman was competent, however it was neither as unctuous or as generous with velvety potato as the best style of the dish is - and the meat was off the bone. All fine and dandy I suppose but nothing to write home about. Competent. I will be back when I need a fix of tom yum and I need it now and close by. However I will continue my search for better Thai in London.",

Happily, my flatmate pointed out the Thai supermarket just round the corner (which I had never noticed before...). The shop is attached to a restaurant of the same name, and as it supplies it I assume the restaurant is good! The shop has a really good range of fresh Thai ingredients - I was really impressed to see both holy and sweet basil, galangal, three different types of chilli, Thai baby aubergines, Thai long beans and a variety of other veg which you just can't buy in a British supermarket, but which are essential for proper Thai food. The rest of the shop is packed with tinned and frozen goods, and also stocks Japanese and Korean brands. All of this reasonably priced - not dirt cheap but a lot of the stock is imported and sold in small quantities. I now go to this place at least once a week to pick up a few different ingredients, and always will find something new that they hadn't stocked - or I hadn't noticed - before.

It's not on the English menu, it's only written in Thai, but if you just remember to say those two words - JIM and JOOM - then you'll get served just right and will be royally happy. Jim Joom is Thailand's version of Shabu Shabu, or Chinese Hot Pot. It's actually not from all over Thailand but from the spicy hot region of Isaan, close to Cambodia and Laos and famous for good food.The Jim Joom served at Taste of Siam is never-ending. For real. For \u00a312.50 per person you get a boiling hotpot of galangal and lemongrass soup in which to cook massive plates of raw chicken, beef, squid and prawns. You also get tofu, noodles, an amazing selection of expensive mushrooms and a whole BASKET of herbs and vegetables. The morning glory is beautifully fresh. That's a lot of great food, with some gorgeous spicy dips too. But one of the amazing things is that if you run out of anything, just ask for more and its free. It really is never-ending. I promise you your gut will give up first. You'll be so full you'll be in drunk love with everything.Just check out my photos if you don't believe me.Also... they did the best Thai iced coffee I've had in London.",

I got hit by the hot pot liquid three times during the whole dinner. So be careful who you are hot potting. For \u00a312 per head (might have changed since) this place is pretty decent for hot pot. \u00a0You get everything from mushrooms, rice noodles, lettuce, chicken, pork, liver, beef, lamb, prawns, squid, egg, baby corn, the list was endless.The sauces were not so great, I ate my hot pot plain.Never tried the other foods on the meal. I think the hot pot is more their speciality.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place since I moved here as it's only a short walk from my flat, when I looked it their website I saw they had a whole page devoted to their noodle bar, serving noodle soups and... suki/hotpot! 2 of my absolute favourite things! So decided to go there.Came on Saturday night and it wasn't that busy, although they moved us off one table after about 10 minutes because they said it'd been booked. Wanted to order the hot pot but couldn't find it anywhere in the English menu... Thank god for Yelp! After seeing Tom E's review we asked for it and got it, they seemed a little confused, but it was amazing. Amazing. We were on a table for 2 and they had to bring out another little table for ALL THE FOOD. Everyone in the restaurant was eating the hot pot. GO THERE now and eat it. It brought me right back to Thailand, which, lets be honest is where I wish I was 90% of the time. After boiling my food and steaming my face for about 2 hours I left so happy... and pretty much spherical.",

I have had most of the menu, and have not been disappointed. Service is great; the waitresses and waiters are speedy and polite. Want a good meal but don't know what to chose? Order the pad thai (I usually order it with tofu which isn't listed on the menu, but they do have it) as a main and the spring rolls as a starter, or the fried crab claws. Their thai iced tea is also pretty amazing. I really don't have anything negative to say, but I have noticed that depending on which 'restaurant' you sit in (there are several of the same restaurant next to one another) I think the chefs are different, so the style of the dishes varies slightly. Oh, and ask for their chili oil--its really tasty!",

I love Thai food and their green chicken curry (ask for it with coconut rice) is simply one of my favourites. Great value for money (\u00a34.95 at lunchtimes) and if you do work nearby, it's worthwhile going there early as it fills up quickly. Service is efficient, I wouldn't say it's overly friendly but there's nothing to complain about. One of my favourite lunchtime haunts.",

Indeed i was not let down as my prawn in rice noodles and vegetables arrived. on the other hand they forgot to bring over my rice, which i had to remind them about. not a major let down and since the food was certainly above average ill still give them a well deserved four stars.Keep up it up guys.",

So I finally did and I am not disappointed at all. Most importantly the food is just really good. The fish cakes, the coconut chicken soup, the green curry, the chilli basil stir fry, it all was very tasty, with the right spiciness to it. On a Tuesday night two of the three spaces they operate in were partially filled with people so it was quite busy which is nice. We were welcomed and directed to a table very promptly and after a quick order because we were rather starving we got our starters very soon. We shared starters so it was perfect they did not come at once, which would have been a bit different if we would have wanted it all together.Just go there if you feel like eating Thai!And don't forget the supermarket next door has some special ingredients if you want to DIY.",

The tofu starter was mediocre considering that there's just 6 pieces of extremely fried tofu with a very common sweet and sour sauce (topped with garlic but didn't do anything to the flavor) and was charged almost \u00a35 for it. Not gonna order it again. The Pad Thai came so quick that I don't know if I should be impressed or suspicious. It was tasty but lacked the bit of sweetness that Pad thai usually consists. Noodles are not soggy (thumbs up) and prawns were really fresh. Pad see ew was amazing though! The sauce was just at the right saltiness and not too oily. One thing good about this restaurant is that they don't overcook their noodles, meaning I'm probably coming back soon. They also have a great list of curries that is yet for me to try. Oh, and seems like takeaways are pretty popular here as they don't deliver.",

I went with my usual pad thai and the bf tried panang curry. Our food came out very quickly, much sooner than I expected but was hot tasty and fresh. The environment was nice, cozy and clean.

The Thai curry is amazing. Love the sauce and the rice, and you get plenty of chicken too. Satay skewers as a starter is good too!Really can't fault it as a great lunch deal.",

    "text": "We grabbed dinner here tonight and the food was very good!We started with the Tom Yum Kai for 4.50 pounds and it was really tasty. I didn't love the taste of the chicken in there but it was fine.My husband had the pad see ew with beef. The beef was very tough but he liked the sauce (it wasn't for me).I ordered the Pad Thai and subbed out the prawns for chicken. I also asked for it spicy and the server was very short with us about that -- he really just wanted to give us the spice dish to add our own. I really am not a big fan of the spice dish, I always feel it tastes better when they add the spice in the kitchen. Luckily, he did finally agree to make it spicy and it was really good - but very spicy so be careful if you're not into that sort of thing.My husband did end up using the spice tray option for his pad see ew (instead of having the kitchen do it) and the spice was very oily.The entrees were 6.50 pounds each. Service was not too friendly.I'd recommend this place.",

    "text": "I have been frequenting this place for three years (so I dont know why its taken so long to review it!?)Its made up of three eateries, and an asian food shop. Of the three eateries ive eaten in the noodle bar and the restaurant. The other part is more of an over flow area that sometimes opens for groups. \u00a0The food here is by far the best thai ive had in london and its very reasonably priced. The staff are typical thai I.e. very friendly and the food is super tasty. When I have out of towners in, I always take them to this spot as I know the quality it routinely excellent and the price is very \"un-london\". The menu covers a whole load of different dishes of which ive tried most. Id recommend the massaman curry and the thai beef chili salad.... but everything is good.All three of the eateries are very comfortable and unfussy in decor. This place isnt super posh but for what you pay and what they serve its well worth 5 *'s",

This is a review for the supermarket.5 stars because it's the only place where I can find Thai pea aubergines and coriander with roots along with more commonly found items such as galangal, kafir line leaves and other Thai ingredients. Also fresh S. E. Asian vegetables and lots of pastes and sauces for cooking. A small shop but plenty of interesting stock and friendly owner too.",
