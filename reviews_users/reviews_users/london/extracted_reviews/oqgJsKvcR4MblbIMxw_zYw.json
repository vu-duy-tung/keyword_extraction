    "text": "I had a meal there this week after seeing a film in town and I was suitably impressed. The restaurant was quiet and not too busy, I did put this down to the weather given how rainy it had been that day but nonetheless it lead to a very nice, relaxed meal as we had a whole table to ourselves. The food was more than satisfying and I had a pad thai which had prawns and crabmeat on top which was a new one for me. It was beautifully presented and they were very generous with the ratio of prawns and crab. Perhaps I had a generous chef or the accountant that controls portion sizes was having a night off. Nevertheless I was happy. My partner had some swordfish and coconut rice, we also had a bowl of morning glory which came with dried shrimp. It was very similar to many dishes of greens I have eaten when in southeast Asia and I really liked that everything we ate didn't taste as if it had been overly westernized. Food from this part of the world is meant to be tangy, salty, sometimes smelly, punchy and full of flavour that really packs a punch. Busaba succeeded well on this count. I also found myself newly in love with their lemongrass tea - not only does it taste good but it was presented wonderfully and they even brought honey to add if you wanted to sweeten it. The element of ceremony with the tea pot and cup made it a rather lovely affair. I found that the meal we had was very reasonably priced and presentation was good. We were fortunate enough to be there when it wasn't too busy so we didn't experience any table turning. The waitress was trying to up sell stuff a little but then that is par for the course if in a restaurant. I will return and would be interested to see what its like when it is busy.",

    "text": "I went here as hoping for a decent but fast pre-theatre meal. What I got was something that was very average, both in food and service. The food was unexciting. The sides felt pre-bought - I don't trust those spring rolls which all look uniformly the same size and shape as though turned out from a machine. The mains were acceptable but nothing special - under-spiced and nothing outstanding. At \u00a38+ for a dish you would hope that would be better. On top of that, the service was slow. It took about 20 minutes from ordering to drinks arriving (although we were offered the wrong drinks after just five minutes). Everyone was very nice but, again, nothing special. It felt like the old Busaba experience had been diluted to become a chain-brand in much the same way as any of the other pan-Asian chains (Wagama, Miso, etc). What a shame. (As a final observation, the toilet signs are very odd: two pictures that don't appear to relate to either gender which means that there are constantly confused patrons hanging about outside requiring staff to keep coming over to explain. As far as I can make out the \"\" shaped one is men and the \"Z\" one is women...\")",

Standard thai dishes with plenty of vegetarian options made it easy to find something. The food wasnt greasy as it sometimes can be but also didnt stand out as being totally amazing. For this price category just about what you would expect. What really takes away stars from this place, and maybe its just this location was that everything took forever once we had received a seat. Service was amazingly slow when it came time to pay (it took around 25 minutes from the time we asked for the bill until we left) and it also took a good 45 minutes for the food to come to our table after we had ordered it. Our waitress was also quite short and seemed quite rushed and frustrated the whole night. Conclusion- it could have been an off night but in terms of the wait staff but for standard thai food, Ill probably try somewhere else next time Im in town.",

This occasion that I went, the crab fried rice was a bit too salty unfortunately, but everything else that we ordered (particularly the fried chicken!) was enjoyable.What I did want to highlight was the very good customer service we received. In the middle of eating our chilli prawn fried rice, we discovered a hair. We alerted the waitress. She took it back, and the manager came over to us to profusely apologise. He then offered to take the dish off our bill, and to also let us have another one of the same dish or sub in something else for free. He also took 25% off the rest of our bill. I was very impressed by this gesture as it really demonstrated the manager's desire to make things right, and we happily continued with the rest of our evening.How restaurants handle these situations speak a lot to their bearings. I will still come back!",

The food as well is absolutely lovely, though I do remember waiting a little while to get it and there being confusion about what was for starter and what was for main. I didn't order much on the day because I was wearing a very tight dress and wanted to maintain my composure (how shallow I was two years ago!) , but I tasted a little of everything my friends had and was dead jealous and impressed.

I later ordered Mussaman duck curry with coconut rice and it was delicious. The coconut rice had the right amount of flavor and the duck had an excellent taste and texture. My mother ordered Char-grilled Salmon with coconut rice which was also really well made and with a lot of flavor.

    "text": "When my friends, who know I am a fan of Thai cuisine, heard that I hadn't yet been to Busaba, looked at me aghast. I'd since resolved that I'd eat at the establishment at the first opportunity available. And such an occasion arrived soon enough when a friend was in town and made plans to meet his friends over dinner. And he said, we're meeting at Busaba at Piccadilly Circus. And I trotted on my high heels right over to the establishment across from Princi. And waited for a solid 20mins before I realised with no small degree of exasperation that there was indeed a new Busaba outlet closer to Piccadilly Circus than I had realised and I went over with a rumbling tummy and feet that were starting to complain.I started with the relaxing ginger and honey tea served with a cashew and coconut cookie. I perused the pages of delicious sounding food, and for some unfathomable reason, I played safer than my usual adventurous self, and went for a rather staid Ginger Beef with Thai pepper, chilli and spring onion, with a side of Phad Phak with French bean, broccoli, courgette, baby corn, cashew and pine nut and Coconut rice. Food was tasty all round, and I was pleased with the preparations but I was not impressed with their somewhat mean serving size - of course, it could also be that I was ravenously hungry from standing around outside restaurants and trudging on my heels. The service was nothing to write home about but not too bad either. My vegetarian friend (I seem to have one with me in every Yelp review!) seemed happy with the selection on offer.So ok, I will admit that I am probably being less kind to this establishment than I might have otherwise been. Also, on that evening, as I was meeting a bunch of new people, I couldn't appreciate the shared seating arrangement on benches and the loud ambiance of the restaurant. I'll just have to go back sometime to check for consistency, I guess!",

I found it difficult to choose from the menu as there were so many things I liked the sound of, so my friend and I decided to share - from memory we had coconut rice; a side of vegetables with cashew nuts which were amazing; pumpkin curry and I think duck. The bottle or two *ahem* of red wine that we all shared was lovely too, the service was great, just a tad annoying with the communal seating as we were joined by other customers when we were halfway through our meal. Located well, close to Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus and Haymarket it is as Central as you could hope. Can't wait to return! I'm salivating now.... :-s",

The fact that they cannot substitute meats means that the dishes are probably frozen and pre-packaged, not freshly prepared. So he went for red curry beef and I went for \"Chiang Mai noodle soup,\" their interpretation of the Chiang Mai classic khao soi. Food arrived. Beef curry was tough and practically inedible. Noodles were OK but I could get better from an instant noodle pot. Also, it took over 20 minutes to flag down a server to get the check - and the place was NOT busy - there were only three or four other tables eating. I get that the bar for Thai food in London is very low, but Busaba still disappointed me.",

The portions are really small. It's good for one person that's not really hungry. Their sweet and sour chicken had only four chickens and the rest are vegetables. The pad thai was mostly bean sprouts not enough noodles. The appetizer came when we were done eating the main course. And the waitress never came back to refill the water. I've tasted better Thai food at home.",

    "text": "Chose two of the set menu options with snack, small plate and meal; each for \u00a319.99. We had the chips/seaweed for the snack and satay skewers/bang-kick prawns for the small plates. For our meals we had Tamarind duck breast char-grill and the Thai seafood pasta. The duck was the chewiest meat I've had in my entire life. Don't ever say that's the way duck is. Go to a Chinese restaurant and try duck (When done right it does not require excessive chewing). The flavor was good. The cooking and preparation of the duck was not. 0/5The pasta was spicy, but it featured the tiniest mussels I've ever seen in my entire life. The shrimp was small as well. Here's some advice, quality over quantity. Dropped the mussels and put in bigger shrimp or the other way around. There's no point in having more with less quality. The flavor of the pasta was a bit lacking. It had a kick to it. It was ordered with the yam fries. That's impossible to screw up, ... just kidding. The dip was a Siracha Mayo mix and it was way too much Siracha and not enough Mayo. It lacked creaminess. There's a Siracha bottle on every table. If I wanted more Siracha I could and it. I didn't need it to be 90% Siracha and 10% Mayo. 3/5The snacks were OK. Like literally OK. 3/5The small plates were not terrible. Shrimp were tiny but that's ok for an appetizer dish that was more based on flavor. Flavor wasn't excellent. Chicken satay skewers would be dry had it not been the sauce. 2/5We had 2 mango Lassi, too much yogurt, not enough mango, and needed more ice. Overall, well you can guess. When it comes to proportion, maybe it's a preference but... 2.5/5The service, when it shows up, they're decent. But we found we were forgotten. They already tack on service charge. So adding any more is all up to you. I believe if they know you exist that they should be rewarded, IF they did.",

All the tables seem to be made for groups of 9 or more, so if you come alone or with another person you will most likely be seated with strangers at the same large table. The service is not great. It takes a long time to get menus, to get drinks, or even to put in an order. The good news is, that once you do put in an order, the food shows up quickly. Since it's been a while since I ate here, I don't have many comments about the food. The fish cake was decent, and the King Prawns I had were cooked well. The sauce was tasty too but I remember my mouth being really unhappy with the level of spiciness in the dishes.Bottom line is, this is a decent place to eat, but don't expect any service whatsoever.",

My friends got a starter of these shrimp chips, that were salty and definitely helped us as we waited for our food. The service was very good I thought, but this was a rainy day and I guess I just expected it to be a little better temperature inside than out.

I called them and answered by a nice lady telling me that it's ok to come and they will get us a table.The restaurant was amazing and the food is delicious.

For \u00a312.90 I had a three set menu starting with prawn crackers accompanied with sweet chilli sauce.. Those crackers were the business! It was like biting into fresh prawns! They packed mad flavour in there let me tell you ...Next I had the sticky tamarind chicken wings which were packing flavour too! Hot damn it was revelation!Then I had a healthy plate of pad Thai noodles with smoked chicken and prawns... FLAVOUR CITY right there! So much flavour in there I found myself humming throughout my meal.

Okay, no biggie, that can happen. But it gets you wondering: who is our waiter, exactly? My Tanqueray and tonic arrives. I pour the bottle of tonic water into the gin in the glass, which has only \u00a0two measly - and nearly melted - ice cubes in it (I thought the Brits had finally figured out how to make ice?). I take a sip. Blech! Diet tonic water. I hate diet tonic water. I flag down a waiter and ask for a new drink with regular tonic. A few minutes later another waiter (manager, perhaps) comes by and apologizes: they do not have regular tonic water. Seriously?!? I switch to wine. We order our food - appetizers and mains. Waiter announces that all the food will come out at the same time. No choice in the matter apparently, and no explanation why the appetizers can't come out first. Food takes far longer than it should considering it is not that busy and it's just Pad Thai, chicken satay, and spring rolls. Food was okay, nothing great. All in all I'd give the service 1 star and the food 3, so I'll average it out to 2 stars overall. I will not go back. There are other places with average food that manage to get drinks right and serve starters before mains.",
