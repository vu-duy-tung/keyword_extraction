I remember the flavours to be a refreshing revelation amongst the endless strip of cookie cutter curry shops.So you can understand my disappointment upon returning recently to find that standards have most certainly dropped. I found my pad thai to be pretty lifeless and lacking in the zing that characterises good Thai cooking. My friends green curry was no better. It did not have any of the depth and complexity that I have come to expect from good home cooked thai food. The staff were perfectly pleasant and it was indeed popular, however for the price I was expecting far more from them. Maybe I got you on an off day. I do hope so.",

That didn't really happen here, the service was a little sluggish but that was remedied by the cute waitress asking vodka and lemonade, in the same glass? I chuckled. Tempura prawns were heavy on batter, light on taste but the thai green chicken and prawn curry was good, I devoured a full plate aside from rubbery aubergines. Certainly low-mid priced, but the cute pink lighting, lack of Thai restaurants in the area and proximity to All Saints will make this cafe/restaurant a moderate hit.",

    "text": "hungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  Since Rosa's has opened its first branch in Spitalfields a couple of years ago it has consistently been featured as one of the best cheap eats in time out. I have given Rosa a chance twice and I tend to disagree with time out. I don't think the food is that great and I don't think it's that cheap either. I am not so keen on the place itself, it feels claustrophobic and very loud, especially when you go there at peak times. We had Yam Som O (7.15) as one of the starters, a rather generous portion of pomelo salad with prawns and deep-fried tofu. It came with some nice but quite heavy/creamy sauce. Even though we really liked it, it was very filling, something one is not quite used to from Thai salads. The vegetable Tom Kha (5.10) was served with loads of fresh vegetables and even more lemongrass. Not the best Tom Kha I've ever had but really quite tasty. As a main we went with another classic \u00a0Pad Thai with prawns (8.25) which was light and very nice even though there was something not quite right with the consistency of the prawns, we left most of them behind. And then the disappointment of the evening: The Thai Green Curry with chicken (9.50) was one of the worst Thai curries I've had (if I don't count my own attempts to cook Thai curry) \u00a0watery, bland, not at all spicy \u00a0it was lacking any depth or flavour. Green Thai curry is one of my all time favourite dishes so this made me quite unhappy. 3 ok dishes and one that didn't deliver at all \u00a0clearly no recommendation from me for Rosa's They have recently opened another branch in Soho, I haven't been there. Not sure I necessarily need to go though..",

They have a good selection of soft drinks and teas (the ginger tea is potent and very good if you have a cold).

After asking for a table for two, we were placed awkwardly at the end of another table that had already seated 4 other diners. When we asked to sit at a table that was open and that had three place settings we were rudely brushed off and told no for some poorly explained reason. That aside we ate and eventually asked for more water (which was served up with a nice side of a disgruntled, annoyed expression courtesy of our \"lovely\" waitress). Once we were done eating we asked for the check and when it was brought over my friend was interrupted mid-sentence when she was trying to ask for the card machine so that she could pay with a card by the rude waitress's assertion that \"we need the table for another group.\" What the heck? Perhaps if this server was listening, she would have seen that we were *trying* to pay and leave thereafter if given the chance. Long story short, I won't be coming back and have advised others not to as well.",

As soon as I walk out of Spitalfield's market I make a b-line to Brick Lane and rarely pause to take in what's round about. For whatever reason I finally broke this pattern on Sunday afternoon and noticed this beautiful red restaurant. Rosa's is a Thai restaurant with a substantial splash of trendiness in keeping with its location. Inside there is a warm, though fairly minimalist decor, red's and brown's dominating the colour scheme. We sat down on wobbly stools by large brown tables and got ready to order. Rosa's sticks mainly to the Thai classics although there are a few 'fusion' dishes like Spiced Rack of Lamb. Everything is reasonably priced between \u00a35 and \u00a315 and the service is very quick. My Red Curry Stir-fry was delicious and perfect with a bowl of Garlic Brown Rice (although I stunk for ages afterwards!). My friend went for the Duck with Tamarind which she also enjoyed although she claimed it was lacking a vegetable addition to ease her conscience. Rosa's recently got a drink licence and now offers and limited selection of wine and beer. I would thoroughly recommend this spot for small groups at any time of day. Good food in a really relaxed setting.",

Fortunately, this cousin is no glamour model but retains a serious and skilful hand in the kitchen underneath the cosy and charming dining room with its pink and red decor, canteen-style communal dining tables and gentle lighting.Located in the Spitalfields area, Rosa's provides a lovely place to stop off after a day's wandering round here and Brick Lane for some rock solid Thai cooking. The dining area is split into an upstairs and downstairs - I dined upstairsSome restaurants commit the crime of overcooking their meat but I was very impressed with Rosa's delicate hand in the kitchen. I enjoyed a nice moist chicken satay for starter - the peanut sauce makes this dish and the version served here was perfect. Then, I had the masaman curry, which came unusually with lamb cutlets. I like cutlets and the curry had appropriate depth of flavour.Having also discovered Song Que at lunchtime, this was a great day out in east London",

It's pretty boring, I've got to be honest. \u00a0(For those without interest, scroll down to the ** below.)Rosa is an 80-year old woman who opened a quaint European caff at this location many many moons ago. It's rumoured that Bud Flanagan lived upstairs and the walls at one time were covered with signed memorabilia (as well as Rosa's own birth certificate, cause why not, right?)Rosa is still alive and kickin', but is no longer behind her store front. She sold her relic of a restaurant to the current owners a little over a year ago, who have since turned it into a Thai restaurant, which consequently is absolutely fantastic. How cool that they've kept the original name and just transformed the restaurant into what they can do well? Mega cool points in my book. Extra star if they put up one of their birth certificates.** Simple, fresh and tasty thai food for a great price. DO it. \u00a0I definitely will again!",

We shared Tom Kha (coconut and chicken soup), Tom Yam (chicken soup), Pad Kra Prow (chilli beef), Moo Yang (chargrilled pork), Gaeng Kiaw Wan (chicken green curry), Broccoli Nam Mun, Santo Isid (white wine). The first two are spicy soups and we were surprised how much meat was in these dishes - there was a fair amount of good meat whereas soups usually have less quality and quantity of meat - this felt like a decent course, more substantial than a starter.The food was very fresh - as if it had just come out of the ground; all the meat was very tender. The spicy flavours of the food were very balanced by there not being any flavour that was too pronounced and a mixture of sensations that really a feeling one needs to experience to understand: quite like instruments of an orchestra blending together and some playing solo but with food flavours.If we had to take one dish away it would be the Gaeng Kiaw Wan (chicken green curry), not because it was not as good but because it was a standard Thai dish that you'd expect at a Thai restaurant and seemed the least interesting. The experience as value for money was worthwhile being not too overpriced. I'd expect to pay just over \u00a320 per head for a decent feed. On the whole an outstanding restaurant and really friendly staff that were so welcoming, polite and looked after us as if we were family. The restaurant does get busy by 8, so it's best to go early if you don't want to queue. The restaurant met all our expectations.",

It does fairly decent Thai food but nothing that's going to blow you away. The selection felt a bit limited to me, considering the range of Thai food out there. There are four of five types of curry with a choice of meat, a few fried noodle dishes, noodles with different types of soup, or satay. A few more salads would have been nice, and maybe some pork with basil or a couple of seafood dishes. The beef red curry we had came with strip of meat that were really tender sunk into a very, thick and rich red sauce. The sauce tasted homemade and had a good strong flavour, but lacked any particular herb or spice hints to add complexity. Its consistency reminded me more of heavy Indian curries than a lot of the lighter Thai ones I've had, but don't know how it is supposed to be done.There a few green beans accompanying the meat, but I personally prefer my Thai curries to use a lot more vegetables and less meat, with eggplant, mushrooms, adding their own flavours and textures. It was all served on a plate, with accompanying egg-fried rice, and designed for a dish for one person. Put it in a big bowl to share instead, and make it slightly more soupy in consistency, with rice served on the side. The soup noodles were reasonable, although the tom yum goong lacked those really potent basil, golangal and lemongrass flavours that make it taste so healthy and good. Again, a few more vegetables in there would have been nice. And, maybe it's just me, but I'm also a bit unsure about using tom yum as a broth for vermicelli style noodles. If the soup's strong enough in flavour, it's probably more enjoyable eating it on its own. Still, I feel like I've complained slightly too much about this place. All in all its not bad Thai food at a very reasonable price. Neither dish did really glaringly wrong, but they just didn't do anything that dazzling either.",

The service was charming and informed, you got the impression they knew their menu inside out and genuinely cared about the place they worked.More importantly the menu was a reminder of Thai travels and the beautiful food encountered on the way. Wide, comprehensive, enchanting without being needlessly complicated or distracted by the restaurants European location. I ordered a scallop, prawn, squid and mussel hot plate with chilli, garlic and (black?) peppers accompanied by Garlic Brown Rice, tasty, spicy, and subtly complex. My companions had chargrilled lamb chops and massaman curry. The lamb was tender delicately spiced and made me envious, I didn't partake in the curry but was told it was \"lovely\" and of a good standard.For dessert we shared a portion of mango sticky rice and coconut (?) dessert. The rice was literally sweet sticky rice with half a mango on top, not that it was bad but there were no surprises within. The coconut on the other hand looked somewhat reminiscent of fondant fancies and tasted like a lovely combination of coconut, jelly and sweetcorn. However odd that might sound it was wonderful and I could have happily eaten everyone else's share.The bill including a main, side, dessert and beer came in just over \u00a320 per head, good value, service and great food.Well worth a trip to Shoreditch, 8/10.A second visit a couple of days ago on a sunday lunchtime I ordered a cod satay which was lovely. It was like a thai fish finger sandwich, and I mean that in the most positive way possible.Consistently and tasty...",

This is how I learned that they have a 10% off discount for takeaway.The restaurant is nice inside, nicer than a lot of Thai places I've been to. The food is good as well, and it feels like I've tried the whole range. A lot of their curries are fantastic, the chicken green curry less so as the chicken is of a texture I've never had from a bird before. Possibly like it had been chewed up and then reconstituted. Coconut rice is good, green papaya salad is great and the soups are decent but not mind-blowing. I think they're also using green beans in place of long beans which is a little odd, but I've only gotten a long bean dish once so maybe it was a one-off. The other good news is they take reservations for large groups. This place is perfect if you're popular.",

It's ideal for a cheap bite on a Sunday afternoon; by the time you've walked from Hackney Rd to Shoreditch via the flower market and Brick Lane, you're ready for a cheap bowl of good noodles, which is what they do best. Pad Thai for three, ginger tea twice, green tea once, all in 25 minutes for \u00a325. Not quite as cheap as eating off a stall, but on a dreary midwinter day, a good deal better. Try Rosa's II on Dean St, currently masquerading as Noodle: the PopUp restaurant, next to the French House. Makeshift until the January refurb, the restaurant sports pine trestle-tables and - get this - semi-private booths at the rear. Look out for the photo of two kings, on the wooden wall facing the window, bought at Chatuchak Weekend Market.",

When I was there I ordered: the \u00a0fresh spring rolls to share, they where delicious, then my starter was a tom yam soup, this is the best revitalizing soup in the world, and as my main the pumpkin Thai red curry, fantastic, with the right balance of spicy and the flavors bursting with every bite.

The only thing I'd probably change as far as the design is concerned is the seating: I prefer chairs to stools so I can stretch back and relax and rub my tummy, but I guess this is just personal preference, during lunch I'm sure it's fine. The food itself was very quick to arrive and very lovingly presented. I ordered Tom Yum (rarely do I stray from this Thai classic) and some sticky rice that came in a little bamboo pot. I asked for my curry to be a little hotter than usual and they happily obliged. My friend ordered Goong Pad Noh Mai (stir-fried jumbo prawns with asparagus in oyster sauce) which was a little too fishy for me but must have been good, he finished every last morsel.

With no compromise on flavour or presentation. FACT2. Flavour - Thai food is one of my favorites so I eat a lot of noodles, rice and curry. Having eating so much I know bad and I know good and this was, off the beaten track, night market, pull a shrimp out the sea kinda good. FACT3. Staff - Our waitresses were delightful and a joy to be in there company. We ordered two Lemongrass which didn't go down well, noticing my screwed up face she politely took them away and deducted them from the final bill, no questions asked. FACT4. Setting - Making no apologies for it's cafe style seating the open doors and large window present the illusion of an area much larger than it's square footage and give diners an airy feel. Music spilt in from the neighboring band making the moat perfect accompaniment to the meal. FACT \u00a05. Drinks - Not the best and the reason for four and not five stars. The idea of carafes is a good one but what is put into the carafe matter. Ros\u00e8 was pretty dreadful and if Rosa can't select Ros\u00e8 perhaps she should consider introducing BYOB.

Also, I have a few Thai spots not that far from me that are pretty awesome so I never see the point in travelling. I'm not saying that this place isn't good, it's just not what everyone seems to be raving about. For a start they had those awful black square plates that were all the rage in the nineties. They you get the nonchalant service piled on top of that and the mid range price tag and I'm thinking I should have saved some cash and just gone for a curry down Brick Lane.There is a down stairs area that might be nice for dinner and the food was tasty so I might just pop back again, but from what I experienced this lunchtime, I was left with lemons in my mouth.",

The pumpkin was still hard and not sweet at all, the curry was quite bland.Overall, the standard has definitely dropped from a few years back when it was one of the best Thai places in town \u00a0now it seems they just want to squeeze as much money as they can out of their past reputation.Avoid!",

It is a small restaurant, so there are not so many seats available. Around 2pm though it is quite easy to find a free table.",

Interesting was the availability of duck and lamb in a number of dishes. Across our group we had ratings from 3.5 to 4.5. I had the lamb curry - it was excellent. Presentation of the food is great. Quantity is ample but not excessive. Staff was friendly and attentive, and despite it getting quite crowded we didn't feel hurried.Clientele was vibrant - average age probably around 30. Due to the relatively small size, it felt cosy but not too loud.Had an excellent cold Ginger drink. Drawbacks - pay extra for side of rice and only one beer on the list of drinks. Also there are no desserts available. They have coffee but no Espresso machine.",

Everything about that dish is perfect, except the big, un-chewable pieces of lemon grass. The taste of lemon grass overpowers the fish taste and spoils the dish completely! It also comes with vegetables.. 2 pieces of Cauliflower, 2 pieces of cucumber and something else.. It's disappointing that they serve these vegetables raw! The least they could've done is at least grilled those a little bit! Service was OK.

Clearly, some member of the staff saw him coming in, but it seemed like ages before someone actually asked him to leave.

They had placed a cute sign outside which said something like \"Come on in! [List of delicious sounded hot beverages]\". I was blinded by cold so probably should have looked more closely as it's clearly not a caf\u00e9. We realized that when we sat down but.....it was cold. And they said they had coffee.We ended up just ordering a hot chocolate and a green tea. Weirdly, we watched several couples walk in and ask if they could sit for coffee and tea and were refused. It was that odd time between lunch and dinner services (4pm) and it was pretty quiet, there were free tables all around. But, they turned person after person away, who probably also saw the sign outside and thought \"hurray, warmth and hot drinks\". It seems if you grabbed a seat and *then* asked (as everyone sitting had) you were served coffee/teas, otherwise it was take away only for hot beverages. The place advertised Monmouth coffee, which is excellent, but I had already caffeinated so I ordered a hot chocolate thinking the quality would be pretty good. I was served something akin to hot chocolate in a mug. It was hot, but I think it was water, and it was filled with a small scoop of the fake powdered stuff out of a can. They didn't even wipe the chocolate dust off the lip of the mug. None of the fancy extras that might have been served at a cafe (mallows, foam, etc.). My boyfriend was served loose leaf tea with no strainer :/. Looks like it might be a great Thai joint, but with a slight identity crisis. I think the lesson here is stick with what you know (and their menu looks like it could be good!).",

The Salmon Red curry came with 3 giant pieces of salmon and from his reaction, tasted way better than it might have looked (since it was just 3 pieces of salmon partly submerged in curry). We also ordered the Mango sticky rice which was good. I actually enjoyed the Mango pieces a lot more than the rice because they were fresh and amazing! The service was fast and friendly.

Not soupy like most Thai restaurants. The black pepper venison came out and looked and smelled delicious. It didn't disappoint. The meat was tender and succulent, the veggies tender crisp and the sauce was full of complex flavors. All in all I was impressed with the freshness of each dish and the authentic flavors presented.

Generally I go in with low expectations for most asian restaurants when it comes to service.The food was decent and reasonably priced. The fish cakes were a bit rubbery but overall had good flavor. It seems like not all Thai places in London serve Pad See Ewe so definitely a plus that they have it. The seafood hotplate was cooked well but I could have gone with a bit more kick.fish cakes thod mun pla Lightly spiced fish cakes, with crushed peanuts & sweet chilli saucestir fried flat noodles pad see ewe Rice noodles with sweet soya sauce & vegetables, chickenspicy seafood hotplate ta lae pad cha \u00a0Squid, tiger prawns, mussels & scallops stir-fried with mixed spices, chilli, black pepper & galangal",

But I'm fine with that.My picks:Soft-shell crab to startDuck red curry/Pad talay for main, sometimes bothPerfect for dates or groups of friends, they also deliver locally, which is great when you're working late.",

    "text": "A delicious meal. We shared lemongrass chicken, the texture was so soft and the taste was wow wow wow. The Thai green curry was the other dish we split. The sauce was so tasty that we were lapping it up like soup long after our rice was finished.The starters were OK but perhaps we ordered boringly. I liked the staff, they were friendly, didn't hurry us at all. Perhaps they were too busy as we had to ask twice for the bill and one of us was in a rush. Will keep coming back again and again. Xx",

    "text": "I do love Rosa's and this outpost is particularly adorably sized with lots of cosy tables for two and stool seating. There were a few things that made this just an 'ok' visit though. Firstly, the place was like a sauna. I thought it was just the effect of coming in from the cold outside, but the initial gratitude I felt for the cosiness soon turned into mildly sweaty discomfort, particularly given you're sitting in close proximity to the table next to you. Secondly, they could do with a few more clothes pegs on the walls, though I realise this is only an issue during this time of year when I walked in wearing 4 layers. I gradually peeled them off (well 3 of them anyway) to deal with the sauna style heat but had nowhere to put them except on the floor or to sit on top of them on my stool. Finally, I found the chicken in my pad thai a little dry and tough this visit; it had clearly been overcooked. Hopefully this was a one-off as I would hate to have to change my staple order here! The noodles remained nicely spiced however and I always appreciate the kick of their crazy strong chilli flakes. The staff looked after us well too so I would return if I was in the area, and hope for better next time.",

    "text": "An average place. Heartless.A good place, especially for 8-10 people (they have another room downstairs) looking for cheap almost thai food. Almost as yeah this is thai, but it's a bit flavorless, missing the fundamental qualities that makes thailand one of the best food countries in the world. And decoration, thai cuisine is decorated, it has that fine oriental touch, independently from the cost of the food, coming from a restaurant or a street vendor. This is more like a vietnamese person preparing thai food.There is nothing more to say, I still have to find good thai food in London, and that's surely not.But it's a good place for a group of friends willing to have a cheap oriental dinner.",

We ordered:- Thai Calamari (Deep-fried craispy squid served with plum sauce): very good- Grilled Pork Neck / Moo Yang (Char-grilled marinated pork served with spicy dry chilli sauce and cooled steamed vegetables): I was very excited about this but it didnt turn out good. The meat was not tender and it tasted like charcoal. The veggies and sauce was okay- Thick Red Chicken Curry / Penang Gai (Chicken Penang curry): FANTASTIC..very salty but flavourful. Best thing ordered- Thai Iced Tea: a bit watered downThe place is small but the food comes very fast, so even on a friday night, there was no wait for us. Nice joint.",
