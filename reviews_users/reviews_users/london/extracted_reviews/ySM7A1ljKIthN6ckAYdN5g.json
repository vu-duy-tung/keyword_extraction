    "text": "In the world of pubs, a lot of things are the same. Usually the food is the same, and often the options to drink are the same. The location can be a differentiating factor, and the prices, and the service. And sometimes, it's just a moment in your mind that makes a pub stand out. In this case, it's the sun pouring in a window to my best friend and I, seated at a table made of long benches, tucking into a burger, fish, and chips, with a couple pints, and a breeze wafting over us. We picked the Marquis of Westminster because they were open on a Sunday, and not far from Victoria station (remember what I said about location). They had a wide menu, and good service from the young men at the bar. The prices were pretty standard, but as my friend was treating me to a \"you're about to graduate!\" lunch, it all worked out in the end. As well, my bezzie wanted fish and chips, and the previous reviews said they were good. We had a multi-course meal, and tried the scotch eggs, and fruit and cream dessert. All around, it was a good meal.It's a nice place to pop in, I'm sure it's a good local, as they have both indoor and outdoor seating in good weather, and they're right on the corner of two streets, which I'm sure aids when waiting for a cab. A good choice if you're in the area!",

The burger I got was quite pricey for what it was. \u00a312.50 for a burger and fries. That's not out of the ordinary for burgers in London. The whole burger was meh. The cheese was cold. Bacon was barely there. My colleague didn't even have a piece of bacon on his burger. When it came time for the bill, we paid for a food but when we asked for a receipt, the waitress gave way too much sass in her reply of no. I think the xmas stress got to the kitchen staff and the waitress, maybe another visit when it is less busy will be better. I will probably come back to the pub downstairs but not for the food.",

The guy who seemed to be the manager was running around frantically trying to take care of people while we were there but was very friendly.They were out of the burger that we ordered so had to substitute for the pulled pork sandwich which was good. The beef Sunday roast was very good. Not the absolute best that I've had but still hit the spot. Also had the sticky toffee pudding which didn't last long on our plate. Great food for the price! Would have given a higher score if we weren't seated by the server's stand but would recommend this place to others.",

I thought it was a wonderful pub and although we didn't eat here we saw lots of people who were and the food smelled wonderful. The service was great and we noticed it seems to be more of a local pub than a tourist one. Most of the people who walked through the door seemed to know everyone sitting at the bar and working behind it. We tried to go in here 2 of the nights we were here but there were just too many people you could barely move, which is usually the sign of a good pub in my books. Also, Thursday nights seem to be the busiest for pubs in London so if you want to get a seat here, go early! All in all it's a great lil pub and I would def go here again.",

There is a now gastro-pub restaurant upstairs as well as the usual bar on the ground floor. We have been to eat 3 times since it has re-opened and it was fantastic every time. We can thoroughly recommend the food form both the restaurant and the bar menus. Great fish and chips and one of the best burgers in London! The Sunday roast was excellent too and puddings and scotch eggs were equally delicious. The bar staff are always very friendly and the service is always great. There is always a good choice of well kept cask ale as well as the premium lagers you'd expect. If you are staying in the area or trying to find somewhere to eat or drink in Pimlico, look no further than the Marquis of Westminster!",

    "text": "This is a brunch review, so if you're wanting detailed analysis of the Sunday roast or the guest ales, you'll have to wait. I came for the brunch and now I'm going to review it.The reason we went to The Marquis for brunch (it's not exactly your standard brunch location as it's very pubby) is because we had the dogs and wanted to sit outside. It was about 12 on a Sunday and it was eerily quiet, I think there were only 3 or 4 other diners in the restaurant. But the bar staff were very friendly, said we could have the dogs inside (which we didn't do, because it was relatively warm) and dealt with our orders pretty quickly. They also have newspapers to read, which I think is always a nice (and very easy) touch.For me, the biggest appeal of The Marquis were the prices. My pancakes and bacon were only \u00a35.90, which is great value for the area, and my girlfriend's avocado and halloumi wrap was \u00a35.25. Neither of these dishes were perfect - the wrap was a little small and my pancakes could've used extra maple syrup - but they were both good (the pancakes were very fluffy, full marks there) and great value. I also had a decent coffee, though, as a coffee snob, I probably wouldn't go there just for the coffee.Brunch is a holistic experience. Some people really hype brunch places where you're expected to queue for an hour just to get a table, and that's really not for me. So I give The Marquis plus points for being quiet, friendly and amenable to my canine companions. The prices make it an appealing venue for a casual, unshowy brunch (I probably wouldn't invite friends to the area specifically to brunch there) and it would be flirting with 5-stars for me if they'd given me a hearty pot of maple syrup on the side!",

Beer was fine also. Sunny, warm, and welcoming place in the mid-afternoon. I would go back again if I'm in the area. Pimlico is a cute little place.One weird thing though: the staff and the other patrons were all foreign. There was not a Birtish person in the place. I guess that's perfectly normal in London, but it made the whole experience seem a bit contrived. I was hoping for a more homey feel but since it was my first hour in London I probably had my hopes too high. Still, our Canadian waitress was adorable.Maybe it's all the good reviews attracting people from abroad. Anyway I'd have preferred to go somewhere more \"local,\" if such a place exists in that area.",

    "text": "This restaurant & pub is probably gonna go largely unnoticed in both the TripAdvisor and mainstream of good London food. They had a sign that they were open from 9am for breakfast. I was staying nearby, a few blocks from Victor Station. So I wanted to get up and check this one out. I get in and it's entirely a nice British Pub atmosphere. There were only a few people there, so they were eager to get me in for some good grub. Ordered the full breakfast special for about \u00a38. Turns out that was a great value for the portions I got. Breakfast here is a must for anyone! It was so delicious that I rewarded them by having a beer with it, just for some extra business. Looks like quite the place again when walking by later in the day. The pub is packed, they got music, and everyone seems to be enjoying themselves. I'd grab another beer, but I was off and running to the next European destination.Check out their breakfast special!!!",

    "text": "Join the Club ClubIt is well known that I can often be found sitting at a bar, sobbing into a handful of rubbish bread filled with bacon, chicken and some form of egg and old salad. Many years I have travelled the globe, and many times I have found myself getting hunger pains after too much walking and not enough eating. The \u00a0remedy for this ailment is always preferably a Club Sandwich and a pint of something cold, while enjoying being invisible among the local populace. All too many times have I been let down by the initial excitement of a lively, and friendly, welcome to a lovely slice of local life, to receive a substandard cold soggy tasteless Club Sandwich.But not here I tell you. These guys know how to make a club sandwich, in fact they made it so damn near perfect that I even ate the crusts! Now I like some fresh chicken, preferably warm, and for my bacon to be crunchy, check and check. I like fresh salad, but not too much of it, check again. I also like lashings of mayo, 3 slices of lightly toasted bread, AND I like a freshly prepared egg (fried or boiled), check, check, and mother flipping check. These guys ticked all the sandwich requirements, bar one, I like mine cut into 4 triangles, not 2, but if it is made correctly it should be easy to dissect once more yourself!!! I like to dip the corners into ketchup without everything falling out, I'm just telling you that this was also possible! While we are discussing a list of things I like, I also like skinny chips, I hate stupid chunky ones, I like them to be so skinny that they flip and flop around while you smother them in mayo. Would you be surprised if I told you that they also served me skinny chips, no I don't think you would, because I said earlier that this was DAMN NEAR PERFECT!Some decent banter form the friendly guys behind the bar, a pint of Timothy Taylor's Landlord to wash it down, and I skipped out of that place like the King of Clubs (I don't think he skips, but if he did, \u00a0he would look like me at that moment).",

    "text": "I had high expectations for this place due to the 4/5 star ratings given for this restaurant, however, my family and I did not have quite the same 5 star experience. Walking past this place on our way to the hotel, the day before coming here, we noticed people outside enjoying happy hour and just thought it would be a wonderful place to have dinner while in London. For starters I'll give feedback on what was good-the staff was uber friendly, checked in twice for drink orders and gave us enough time to order food. The music they played in the background was also really great, popular 80's hits which I personally really enjoyed. The seating area upstairs was large enough for small groups of about 3-6 people, also very cozy and comfortable. As for food, we ordered the cajun chicken nachos which had great flavor and were just the right temperature. The only issue with them was that the cheese to chip ratio was very off, way too many chips and not enough cheese to cover them. I had the mac and cheese due to popularity and the fact that they were out of fish and chips by the time we came. The mac and cheese was very good, super creamy with loads of flavor, and piping hot which is probably the most important thing when it comes to a good meal. My cousin Marley had the sausage and mash which she raved about being fantastic. As for our experience at The Marquis, this is all I could say met our standards. On the other hand, I'm giving this restaurant a 2/5 stars because of quite a few issues we experienced during our meal. The service is quite slow here, way slower than expected due to the amount of people upstairs eating. There were about 4 other couples when we came and by the time our food was served (about an hour after being seated), there was only one other couple left which I think is unacceptable. The lighting is very dim, so dim we actually had trouble reading the menus. The staff also wasn't very attentive as the night lured on, they didn't check up on us and took about 30 minutes for them to bring us dessert (which was sticky toffee pudding and unfortunately quite cold). My father had the Marquis English pie for dinner which he described as \"very burnt and dry but tons of flavor.\" Overall he said that it could be better and that they didn't care enough to check and see if it was ok to serve. Toward the end of our meal when we were waiting for the check to come, the waitresses seemed to be less interested in the customers and more interested in their own conversations which I found to be a poor service tactic. Overall, honestly I was expecting a lot and was quite disappointed. However, we may have just came on a bad night but I'm still sure I wouldn't particularity recommend this place to friends.",

Downstairs was mainly standing area with locals and newcomers alike drinking a pint and enjoying the Christmas merriment. For sit-down meals we had to head upstairs to the dining area. Upstairs was moonlit and inviting. The coziness was lovely, looking out the large Victorian windows at the cold winter night was almost idyllic. We ordered a couple of beers, Old Speckled Hen and Peroni. Very different but good all the same. My mister was insistent on ordering the whitebait to start. I'm not a fan of fishiness but being in London, I supposed it was more about doing as in Rome, so we ordered them. As I expected, they weren't for me, but mister liked them, they were lightly fried and ample of them. For dinner I had the lentil soup with bread, and my mister the fish and chips. All very good but not exactly showstoppers. I chose soup to save room for desert, which I ordered the pear, ginger and rhubarb crumble with clotted cream. Ah it was delicious, regardless of not tasting any ginger in it. It was exactly what I was waiting for. Hot and homey, it was yummy and a typical British winter dessert to top off a lovely evening out in Westminster.",

I ordered a pint and scotch egg firs. It was out of this world. I wanted to try more so I asked for a suggestion and the bt suggested the winter pie, so I went for it and it was out of this world. Hot, flavorful meat and a buttery flaky crust. Yum. I ended my night with a mulled cider and was on my way. A perfect first night in London!",

The bottom floor is for just a bar and tables for people who are looking to have a drink. If you want to order food, you need to go up the stars to the 2nd floor. I had come here hoping to get a scotch egg because it was my last night in London haha but unfortunately because of their limited menu for Bank Day, they weren't able to make scotch eggs that day. I ended up getting fish and chips, and my bf wasn't hungry so he just got some soup (I forgot what kind it was). The fish and chips were pretty average, I've had better back in America. The soup was also okay, a little too creamy and kinda bland. I got a beer and my bf had some whiskey. Both were reasonably priced and decent. We also shared the sticky toffee for dessert, which was the right amount of sweetness and very good. I think the drinks and dessert was the best part of the meal.Maybe the restaurant is better when they have their full menu available, but I'm not sure how inclined I would be to return since London has so many pubs.",

    "text": "This is a great pub to for authentic British food, and they also had some non-British items on the menu in case you don't want Bangers and Mash or Fish and Chips. I had their cheeseburger sliders, which were good but small portions (that was fine because I wanted a small meal). I also had their soup of the day, which was some sort of squash soup, and I really enjoyed it. It might be better to make a reservation here in advance because it was really busy when we came here on a Wednesday night. They were able to seat us, but we were kind of cramped into a small table by the window. This is a good place for tourists, but there were definitely some locals dining here too. To get to the restaurant area of the pub, you have to go upstairs.",

Pan fried Hake was fresh and delicious. Soup was also very nice. The winter pot pie was good but had too much of a beefy flavor. It was very one sided. There were very few veggies in the pie. On the other hand the pot pie crust was amazing. Very buttery and crisp. Got one of their specialty ale but not my style. I'd go with one of their draughts.",

    "text": "This was probably our go to place during our stay in London. It was conveniently situated next to our hotel. On our first night we braved the bar and it was just the English \u00a0experience I was looking for. Super friendly locals in a drunken stupor laughing and toasting to random celebratory events, imagined or real. The bar tenders were extremely friendly as well as the waiters.We were new to the scene and quite frankly overwhelmed. Our bar tender, sensing our amateur tastes in anything alcoholic really, suggested a pale ale, the \"Aspall\" of Suffolk. Of course, I had to let out a chuckle. But the moment the gargantuan sized glass was set in front of me, I was eager to sip the golden beverage. I sipped and instantly fell in love. How could a pale ale beer taste so delicious. It can be only described as subtle hints of citrus, the hops flavor not overpowering at all, it was light, and had a crisp, \"clean\" after taste. Imagine the beer version of 7up or Sprite, because that was exactly what it was.Along with our drinks, we chatted with locals and travelers alike and it was just a fantastic bar atmosphere drastically different from the US.As our stay in London came to an end, we ventured to try their brunch/lunch items. I ordered the Lamb Rump, and my goodness was it delicious. Travel tip: If you know your own country does something well, don't order that because subconsciously nothing will measure up, I mean it might, but that's a risk you're taking. Instead, order an item you know the country you're visiting will most likely execute perfectly. So lamb rump, red wine jus, and seasonal vegetables was an obvious choice. And, my theory was right. It was absolutely juicy, tender, seasoned beyond perfection and was the ultimate English comfort food I could've hoped for. If you want a friendly, fun, and delicious spot in London and you happen to be in this area, do yourself a favor and frequent this spot. It will have you longing for more!",

    "text": "This was our first sit-down meal on our first night in London. I wish I could say that we chose this restaurant based on reviews alone, but honestly, we made this our dinner stop because it was close to the hotel and open kind of late. Hey, it was snowy, windy and cold that night, and we were absolutely exhausted, so don't judge!The bar downstairs was surprisingly packed when we walked in. I thought we weren't going to find a place to sit when my husband noticed a sign stating that the restaurant is upstairs. So, up the extremely steep, curved staircase we went and popped out in a cute and cozy dining room.We were given a table close to some windows, where we had a nice view of the snow swirling on the crazy fierce wind. We took a moment to review the menu (after ordering our first pints of Guinness, of course).I went with the Marquis Pie, and my husband ordered the fish and chips. We also got the basket of mixed bread to start, because yum. The mixed bread basket ended up being a few slices of toasted pita and two slices of a wheat bread served with butter. A bit pricey for what you're getting, but we had no trouble polishing the basket off.The pie was phenomenal. It came with a small side of buttered greens, served warm. It made me feel like I'd eaten some vegetables, which would balance out the beer, bread and meat pie. I loved the suet crust on the pie - it was flaky and crusty and paired with the pie's insides so well.My husband enjoyed his meal as well, though he did comment at one point that he should've ordered what I'd ordered. Still, the fish was fresh and they were generous with the cut. They didn't offer a whole lot of chips with his meal, which is usually fine as he's not much of a potato guy, but he was starving that night and hoped for a bit more to put in his face.Though we were full, and it was late at night, we decided to splurge on dessert. They had sticky toffee pudding on the menu, which of course I needed. The pudding was cylinder-shaped, served with a small scoop of ice cream and a container of salted caramel on the side. Seriously needed more of that caramel, but the dessert as a whole was delicious.We spent a couple hours holed up at our table, eating, drinking, drinking and eating. We watched the snow flurries, commented on people scurrying by on the street below, and talked ourselves out of ordering another pint or another dessert. This was a really good find for us, and made for a great start to our two week vacation.",

    "text": "Located a few blocks from Victoria station, this is an interesting establishment. When you walk in, they have a casual bar. Upstairs is a nicer sit-down restaurant. And in the basement... well, my guess is a night club? I actually didn't go into the basement but when I looked down into their window, they had flashing strobe lights and loud blaring music so that's just my guess. Anyway, this review is for the restaurant experience. Service was great--the servers were very friendly and attentive to our needs. We didn't have to wait for a party of two on a Saturday night. Our orders came out pretty quickly.As for the food, it wasn't mind-blowing, but it was great comfort food. We had a scotch egg, sausage and mashed potatoes, and a sticky toffee pudding. The scotch egg was cooked perfectly--the yolk was slightly runny and the crust was crisp. The sausages were topped with sweet onions that gave a nice contrast to the savory sausages. It was my first time having toffee pudding and it seemed kind of rubbery, but I wonder if that's how it's supposed be. Overall, it's a good place to eat.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I were looking for a good place to grab a burger and a beer. And stumbled across this place. When we walked in we were greeted from what seemed like friendly service. Told to sit anywhere. So we did. 10 min went by without a single person acknowledging our existence. At this time another couple walked in. We greeted seated and handed menus immediately. And asked what they would like to order shortly after. I on the other hand had to grab a menu off the bar before anyone asked me anything. I don't know about you. But being ignored in a restaurant leaves a bad taste in my mouth. As for the food. I order the cheeseburger- Well prepared. Great tasteGF had chicken cheese sandwich- cheese was melted all over it. Looked good. She said it tasted good also. Some seasoning on the chicken she couldn't pin point.",

    "text": "I got to give this British pub a five star rating for drink, food, and pub-vibe.Cask beer was wonderful. \u00a0The wine pour damn generous! The scene was upbeat. Great location near Victoria Station..in Pimlico Village.Food- I ordered up the Mac & Cheese- multiple types of cheeses, parmesan, chucks of crayfish, and bits of bacon all baked into one delicious creation. Yum. Simonka was our server. She was such a pleasant, witty, and welcoming presence at the pub. What a gem! Thanks for the excellent service & awesome smile. \u00a0Simonka made our day! This pub is worth a visit.",

    "text": "Decent pub food. Sunday roast was great although there were out of the rib eye steak....early on, we were seated around 5:30pm?!? \u00a0So, chicken instead. It was proper. The kids fish & chips was not \u00a0good. It was more like small frozen fish sticks you might get at the market. My daughter wished she order the adult version. Her most bogus meal or the entire two week trip. Service was a bit iffy and not really attentive.",

The menu is a varied and interesting take on traditional pub grub and there's a good selection of drinks on offer at the bar. The staff are friendly chatty and the place has a lot of atmosphere. One of the best pubs in Pimlico IMO.",
