This one is the one slightly nearer the bottom end of the street. Whilst the actual beigels themselves are a bit better in the other one, the fillings are much more generous than they are in the one next door, although if it's salt beef you're after, next door is the place as the salt beef in here is a scary looking grey colour. The cakes in here aren't generally as good as next door, but the chocolate log is simply amazing - the gooiest heaviest cake of all time! Finally, the other one tends to feel a bit more rock and roll late at night, possibly because all the cops tend to come in here instead (it's wider). This is the bake for me, if only for the more generous servings and friendlier staff.",

The bagels are just too tempting that I loose all my self discipline.I have to admit that the first time I tried these bagels, after all the hype, I was disappointed. They are nothing like their American relatives, and not stuffed with all sort of creamy fillings. In stead these are pretty plain and simple ones, but as I noticed later, also very addictive. The place it self is very scruffy and you can't really praise the customer service, and it is just take a way. The best plus side is the price. Cheap!",

They make Beigels to order and it doesn't leave you second guessing as to how long something has been in the fridge. 2. They have more choice of fillings. 3. They are cheaper. 4. The staff smile more. Well these are the main reasons I can think of. If I want something cheap and filling I prefer to come here, especially if I want something like a cheese salad beigel. The smoked salmon and cream cheese, as well as the salt beef are really good from here too. But sometimes I find myself partial to a sausage beigel which I know is slightly sacrilege but sometimes it is just what is needed. As a non Jew I feel I can eat one with a slightly clearer conscience. Regardless of what you put in your beigel, there is a bigger choice and you will find something that will work and not go against your cultural heritage. I haven't eaten many of their cakes but that is because I am quite fussy when it comes to cakes and pastries. Ultra cheap cake and pastry tend to not be of the best quality from what I have experienced. Also of late I have been trying to learn how to bake for myself so I only try and buy what I couldn't do at home.",

You can choose from from both plain and filled (egg, cream cheese, herring, mountains of salt beef), with a selection of tasty traditional breads cooked on the premises and magnificently moreish cakes (gimme that muffin) that soak up impending hangovers and put the blinkers on come downs for Shoreditch's jilted generation. These Jewish beigels are smaller than their tasteless, pre-packaged sisters in fridge freezers nationwide, having a rich brown on the top and with a slightly sweet cream coloured dough inside that is more chewy than Kingsmill. Verdict --- there is no better place to invest small change and crumpled notes anywhere in E1. Oy vey. Quick history lesson to follow: In the late 19th century, the streets around Brick Lane were dramatically transformed by an influx of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. New synagogues, kosher butchers and restaurants opened, and a rich Yiddish culture emerged, with its own newspapers and theatres.",

I'm obsessed with bagels and needless to say I felt the necessity to eat here when I found myself hungry on Brick Lane yesterday.For what I had and the price I paid, it was excellent. I had a bagel (beigel?!) with cream cheese and chives. Not huge, but for \u00a31.30 was a good price for something that wasn't a Tesco sarnie (I eat way too many of those, being a poor, busy student). I can't comment on their other fillings, as nothing else is vegetarian except the egg salad and the variety of add-ons, which I should've had. I could have done with some pickles. But that's another story. If you're a veg looking for something not-so-creative, simple and delicious, this is a good place, but if you want something that could rival a meat-eater's bagel, avoid. You're better off finding somewhere more vegetarian-friendly. However, I would go back. Their baked goods looked delicious and it was a good bagel. :)",

My 6pm beigel purchase wasn't piping hot, just room temp, but was pleasantly chewy and filled with an appropriate amount of cream cheese & chives (not a two-inch thick slather as seems to be the American norm). Apparently you DO get a two-inch thick stack of salt beef when you order that on your bagel, which I didnt, but you can bet its on the agenda for my next visit.",

The reason is that, without fail, almost every time I've taken advantage of their ridiculously cheap bagels, I've been 'one over the XIII'. Thats a little tipsy for those of you less versed in the doings of Asterix.So while the salt beef and salmon & cream cheese-filled bagels always hit the spot, my palate is usually too drunk to know what has hit it. I imagine that in a more sober state, I would criticise the general cheapness of the experience - the salmon sure ain't wild or organic, and the tea can taste like its brewed fom sawdust.But it's opened 24 hours, you get to watch the bagels being dipped in water and laid out on trays by the dozen as you queue, all the while knowing full-well you are participating in a Brick Lane ritual. Not much to ask for \u00a31.20.",

Definitely lived up to my expectations! People think that bagels are just bread shaped in a circle, but they should be so much more than that. These bagels were just that perfect amount of dougheyness. I had mine with cream cheese topped with smoked salmon. I would say that mine could have done with a bit more smoked salmon, but I saw my friends and hers was fully loaded. However, seeing as the bagel was only \u00a31.60 I can't really complain. All I needed to complete this perfect meal was a Ribena...wait, that was also sorted!",

I still want to go back for another bagel. Service = odd. There's a queue, and a long counter top. (Think subway)... But instead of the severs moving down the queue to the next person they just scream NEXT and you have to awkwardly shout your order back whilst trying to head to the front. Part 2, I don't know if it because they were rushing, but they had to say 'lemon and pepper?' To me 3 times because the first two times she said it with her back to me and mumbled it.I wish now id had said no as it looked like the lid fell off the pepper onto my cream cheese. That saying.... It was filling and I do really like the bagels usually and the price is a DREAM!",

There was a 20 person line on Sunday at 3 PM but it moved very quickly, so we were in and out in about 10 minutes. We HAD to try the famous salt beef bagel and it was quite tasty- lots of delicious salt beef, a smear of spicy mustard, and some pickles. The bagel itself was good but surprisingly sweet and rather small. The flavors worked really nicely with the salty and spicy beef and mustard, but if you are seeking NYC-style bagels, this isn't your spot.",

Brilliant. \u00a315 minimum, but I loaded up on some loaves of bread, bagels with cream cheese, bagels with other sandwich toppings, etc. I ate them for a good few days. I like to live like a bachelor. I was very happy. 5 stars. Experience 2: A blustery, rainy Sunday morning. We need to take the dog for a walk and figure we'll head to Brick Lane for some bagels and then make our way to a park. Beigel Bake que is out the door, Beigel Shop (2 doors down) much more manageable. Due to rain, we opt for the shorter que. Mistake. Gone are the bagels of my dreams that were delivered to my door. Instead I get a flat, smushed bagel with extremely \"grainy\" cream cheese that tastes \"off\" and I throw away half. Honestly, I tried to give some to the dog and she didn't even want it. The interior of this place leaves quite a bit to be desired as well. I prefer the ignorance of delivery, I guess. 1-2 stars, not impressed. So there we have it. I doubt I'll be back after that depressing bagel. I'll brave the que and the gruffness a few doors down next time for a quality piece 'o dough with some smooth cream cheese. Word.",

Salt beef, despite the name, isn't very salty. I think it's a reference to the way the meat is preserved. Like corned beef does not have corn in it. It refers to the corn sized salt. Think of salt beef as a very thick cut corned beef. It's really nice to sink your teeth into a big hunk.The Beigel shop is long on taste and low on frills. Stand at the chest high bar and eat and go. The workers here keep up a furious pace, soup nazi with a human face.Under looked is the custard strawberry trifle. Sweet, creamy, velvety good on the tongue.",

    "text": "Two words: Salt beef After touring the town all night, my friend suggested that we try a snack that is popular to Brits at any time of the day. The salt beef bagel. First of all, being from New York, we are used to seeing restaurants and delis open 24/7, but that's not as much of a luxury in London. We were already full from dinner, but my friend URGED us to carve a slight appetite for this hit and I assure you, it was the best thing we could've done!I can't recall how much a salt beef bagel costs (\u00a35 at the most), but you get your money's worth. Its a toasted bagel or bun that is stacked and I mean \u00a0S T A C K E D with salt beef and topped with thin slices of pickles and some mustard. Your typical, but not so typical, deli sandwich. Salt beef tastes like roast beef and pastrami had a baby, named it salt beef, and left it in London. It is so tender, juicy, and, staying true to the name, salty. I do not like salt and eating bread with beef, but damn...forget that, I'll eat salt beef whenever! My friend and I loved it so much that we made it a mission to grab some salt beef bagels for the flight home. Yes, we did that. Yes, we were kind of late to the airport. No, we did not miss our flight! If you are in London and seeking hometown eats that you won't know unless you've lived there, certainly check out the Beigel Shop. It actually is right next to the Beigel Cafe/Kitchen and they compete to see who has the better salt beef. Both are open 24 hours so you're not at a loss. The Beigel Shop offers other items as well, but with the salt beef craze I didn't really order anything else, hence the 4 star rating. 5 STARS FOR SALT BEEF!I miss London now...",

But be aware; this is not to get addicted-adding artificial colors to food is never a good thing....",

    "text": "We stopped here on the Yelp London Street Art Walk. I'm not a big fan of bagels - tend to find them a bit chewy - but they were being handed out, so I took a bit piece to see what these famous rainbow bagels were all about. They were so good, I promptly packed a few to carry home.I chose the salt beef stuffed bagels and the beef was really soft and melt in mouth, even though we only ate them over 12 hours after they were packed. The bagels, were nice and soft with just the right amount of chewiness.We tried the samosas (since we were in Brick Lane) The chicken wasn't bad, but the lamb had too much onion in it to bulk it up rather than flavour it.The coffee is just instant coffee and not something I would recommend, but I'd definitely go back for the bagels",

I liked the consistency, it had a good level of cinnamon in it which was good even though it must be packed full of colourings. I probably wouldn't get it again but \u00a0would recommend giving it a try. They also serve bagels with TONNES of other fillings - the more simple like peanut butter to the more filling and flavourful. I saw someone with the salted beef and it looked amazing!",

    "text": "While the Beigel Shop always seems to come in second place to its next door competitor, they still make a fierce beigel that rivals its competitors in almost every way.So I totally went to two beigel places in one day, less than a block away from each other. Beigel Shop is a modest, hole-in-the-wall that serves some of the cheapest and best food in all of London. Walking inside the small space you are immediately flanked on your left by a whole glass case of various desserts - try to resist your sugar tooth and order a hot salt pork beigel sandwich instead. The salt pork is a delicious red color, melts in your mouth, and isn't nearly as salty as the name would suggest. The beigel is also so much better than regular American bagels (sorry New York) - light, chewy, and sweet. But between Beigel Shop and Beigel Bake, which offers the better product? I think it's too close to call for most people, but if I had to pick one I think Beigel Bake takes home the crown, if only because I thought their beigel was a little sweeter. However, they're both getting five stars in my book, and Beigel Shop can go toe-to-toe with its rival and offers a much better selection of various desserts. So, in sum, go to the one with the shortest line, then while eating walk and wait in the longer line because you're going to want more than one.",

This is a proper old school eatery selling delightful savoury goods as well as some tempting sweet treats. Great breakfast. If you want my advice get there early before the queue gets too big.",
