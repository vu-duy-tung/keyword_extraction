I will say that the shrimp was a bit lacking quality-wise as it seemed to definitely be farmed and thus flimsy and cheap-looking.

I love the decor, they've done a really good job on the colours front in my book. There's potentially a bit of a too-cool-for-school feel about the place which may make some diners uncomfortable as they question whether they belong there or not. I chose to ignore and enjoy though!c*",

    "text": "Ah sweet Kin. You are the reason I got hooked into Yelp London, as my first event here was the MTO (meet the owner) at Kin in early September 2012. From those days, now to daily reviews, I am sad to report I hadn't been back since the MTO until just last week.WHAT WAS I THINKING?Kin is great for several reasons. Brevity is not my strong suit, but I'll try to make it so.1. The food. So delicious. So, so tasty, flavorful and rich and filling and perfectly well cooked and all of the ingredients fitting together. I had the Chicken Satay \"Bun\" noodles and my friend had the Chicken Pad Thai and it was all delicious. I ate myself too full!2. The service. From the normal servers to Lisa herself, this is one of the best customer experiences you can have. Lisa made a special sauce for my friend because he is allergic to chillis. As in, he asked, and she went down to the kitchen HERSELF and made it just for him. She then chatted with us and gave us recommendations and made us feel like the only customers. That is such a wonderful thing in a big city like London.3. The atmosphere. Warm, funky, friendly, colorful, modern... Casual. Perfect any night of the week.4. The Yelp deal. 30% when each person orders two courses or more (so in our case, we did spring rolls, two entrees, and the banana fritters, but I'll come back to those in a moment). It made dinner less than \u00a38 each, so we went \"American-style\" and tipped 20% to show our appreciation. It still saved us money!5. Dessert. \u00a0Instead of the coconut ice cream with banana fritters, we had the green tea ice cream, which was absolutely delectable. I'm not a coconut person, so if you're not either, ask for an exchange. Honestly, this was one of the best desserts I've had in the UK (second only to an amazing sticky toffee pudding in a pub in the highlands of Scotland). All in all, simply amazing. Hat's off.P.S. They do a street food stand during the week on Leather Lane. I haven't had a chance to try, but I've heard good things and I can assure you I'll report back once I've done my \"market research\".",

The food came out very quickly, we were in and out of there within 35 minutes. Foodwise, I had the special of the week which was Yaki Soba with Chicken - it was very flavoursome and the portions were not at all small (although perhaps my dish was a little drowned in Teriyaki/soy sauce). My sister had the pad thai with prawns which she loved. We ordered the duck spring rolls as a starter but these were not good, very greasy with extra crispy duck as the filling, Luckily, we let the waitress know and she didn't charge us for the spring rolls as we just couldn't eat them. I like the interior of the place, it's small but spacious with a wide window letting in a lot of light.I'll definitely be back, maybe to try the take away box for \u00a35 and also the stand outside of the main restaurant for their pork buns.",

The place is not far from Chancery Lane station only 5-10min walk to the restaurant. You can stop by at lunch or even in the evening if you go around there.You can find a variety of Asian foods in a menu such as Thai green curry, Indonesia fried rice, Singapore noodles, and so on. If you just want a small bite while you're waiting for someone, I would recommend a sweet & sour Calamari. But if you would like to order a food to share, grilled pork & vermicelli lettuce wraps is what I would suggest.For a dessert, an homemade ice cream here is amazing! There have two flavor that you MUST try! One is Green tea, another one is Black sesame. I love both because they have a strong flavor. Personally, just only one thing that I'd love to see from Kin is an Azuki beans paste (with beans) seasoned on top of an ice cream. Can't imagine how amazing it is.",

Kin is located right near my school so I came strolling in there one day after class. The decor is light, woody, and relatively casual. The servers are very nice and if you check in on Yelp it's 30% off if everyone in your party orders 2 courses. As I looked over the menu, I noticed they have all the usual Thai dishes with a few fusion ones as well. I was feeling noodle-ly so I ordered the Pad Thai and I must say it was quite delicious. The noodles were still sticky which was great because I hate it when they're soggy. The flavor was right on the money and I nearly demolished the whole plate. My friend ordered the Green Curry with Chicken and I tried a bit of it and a part of me wish I ordered that as well. Next time perhaps, since I don't have multiple stomachs. I topped off my noodles with some banana fritters and black sesame ice cream and it was the 'cherry on top' of my meal. All in all, a very nice casual restaurant that serves up some great food with friendly service.",

We started off with some prawn crackers, Shanghai beer, and lychee juice. \u00a0I love it when I can find lychee juice, as not many restaurants serve it.For the mains I had the vegetarian won ton noodle soup, and he had the prawn yellow curry. \u00a0The won tons were ok, the broth was delicious. Hearty and comforting. \u00a0Big portions, and loads of noodles! I always feel sad when the noodles are finished in a noodle soup, but the serving was really generous and this did not happen. \u00a0Hooray! \u00a0The yellow curry was delicious, but very light on prawns.Service was friendly and efficient. I would definitely plan on a return visit.",

It is true that it took them about an hour to deliver, but it was the windiest night I have ever seen in my life and it was raining, so I forgave them! And the man who did the delivery was just so nice and the food so good that the wait was worth it!We ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry and the Pad Thai as mains and the vegetable and pork Potstickers as starters. Everything was delicious and tasty and the portions were big enough to make us full.Now I just need to go to the main restaurant to see if it matches their home delivery service!",

Just a small suggestion: take two dishes, one can be a bit too small..There is not that much to say, it's just a sweet, lovely place with proper and good asian food, cheap and casual! The only people who won't like this place are the ones who can't stand hot and spicy food: everything is spicy, and when I say I really do mean spicy!",

    "text": "Having now enjoyed two evening repasts at Kin, I believe it's well-deserving of an upgrade in star rating. The space is still open and airy, the staff is still sweet and personable, but I've discovered the key to a good meal: stick to the Thai dishes.Whilst the pork bun noodles were quite filling, they lacked a certain satisfying flavour. Noticeably, the fish sauce provided smelled and tasted less pungent than what I recall from other eateries. However, the green curry had the appropriate consistency and richness of any of the better Thai restaurants I've been to in London. Similarly, the daily special recently featuring ground meat with peppers and chillies served with a friend egg and rice was excellent.By way of entertainment, keeping an eye on the electronic dumbwaiter is somewhat like engaging in dinner and a show. Every time the device beeps and the light turns green, a new set of steaming delicacies emerge to be whisked off to their destinations. Or... I could just be easily amused.What I'd really -love- to see from Kin is a properly respectable spicy pad khee mao. That's the one Thai dish that I crave, and it's absurdly difficult to find around this area in London. If they added it their menu, I'd undoubtedly be back on a regular basis.",

I ordered 'Won Ton Dumpling Soup': really delicious and tasty, with noodles, so yummy! I'm really big fun of 'Nasi Goren' so I tried that main from them. Goodx10! They put a fried egg on top, so it's even better! My friend got 'Chicken Katsu Curry' and she was really pleased with it as well. A little bit spicy but perfect. We were chilling at home watching a movie and that was the perfect dinner.The delivery guy was so nice and sweet. Perfect temperature for the food (and it was freezing outside). We had to wait like an hour to have our food but we didn't mind at all. So worth it at the end! They put plastic cutlery and super cute napkins inside the bags. So nice of them.I should have them on speed dial from now on. Can't wait to go to the actual restaurant to try their food there :)Thank you KIN!!",

    "text": "It was my turn to plan Date Night for my husband and I, so I took to Yelp, like any new Londoner should do. I found KIN, and decided this was the place to go.I made my reservation via the site and it was easy as pie. On Friday, my husband received a call asking if we minded moving our reservation from 7:30pm to 7:45pm. He said we didn't, and they emailed me to update the reservation time. Just as a bit of an aside and explanation for why they didn't call me... getting a phone contract here in the UK (for me) is apparently akin to finding \"The One\", and therefore, I've yet to get a phone. This is an entirely different story and review, so I'll get back to KIN. We arrived to Farringdon a bit early, so we went for a pint at a nearby pub. We never saw KIN on our way to the pub, but were sure we'd passed it on our way. It's just a small little place, so you gotta pay attention. The place is really nice. Very quaint with a long bar that takes up the entire length of the main dining room. We informed them that we had a reservation and were promptly seated in the back (read: more intimate and romantic) room. The owner herself came over to welcome us and give us menus, and we set to our task of figuring out what to order. What I loved from their menu online (as I was selecting our Date Night location, I was looking at menus) is that they offer to serve many of the Thai favourites without egg and without fish sauce. This is great for my husband and I because we don't care for either.We got the Vegetable Spring Rolls and Vegetable Potstickers to share. The Potstickers were perfect little pockets of flavour. They were served with soy sauce which had a slice of pepper in it. I loved the tiny bit of spice it added to the soy sauce. The Spring Rolls were also good. My only complaint was that there weren't more. At \u00a33.80 and \u00a33.70 respectively, that's a bit more than \u00a31.25 for each piece. I would probably get two orders of the Potstickers next time and skip the Spring Rolls. For my main, I got the Tofu Pad Thai... sans egg and fish sauce. I've never had Pad Thai with wide noodles (like in Pad See Ew), but I liked it! I liked it quite a lot! It had just a tiny bit of spice to it, and the lime juice made it a winner.Chris ordered the very spicy Vegetable Pad Kee Mao. It was really nice, but too spicy for me to have had more than a few bites. It wasn't so spicy that we had to get tons of extra water, but it was still pretty spicy.I really wanted to get the Banana Fritters, but by the time we'd eaten all of that, there was no room.This place was a definite winner and we will be going back!",

I had the Green Curry with Tofu and my friend had Pad Kee Mao and they were both delicious, and the perfect portions. Best thing is that it's so reasonable - nothing was over a tenner so it's a great budget choice. I was a bit sad that I only checked in after we had paid because I found out that we could have gotten 20% off the food, making it even cheaper!I was especially happy that the staff didn't seem to mind that we stuck around for a very long time (*ahem* 2 hours) after we had finished our meals and paid. I'm sure that's not the case during busier times but I'm really appreciative that we weren't rushed. I'm really interested in trying their food stall outside now, I'm sure they're awesome!

I ordered the Tom Yum, which I believe to be one of THE quintessential Thai dishes. I can confidently say that Kin failed the dish. It was straight up fish sauce or salt. I believe it was fish sauce. So salty I had to drink a liter of water when I got home. Yes I did eat most of the rice because I was hungry and I didn't want to order another dish. But based on the other reviews, perhaps I ordered wrong? Maybe I should've tried another dish? But I'm assuming at this point that the other reviewers either ordered correctly or have no idea what Thai food (at least Tom Yum) should taste like. I repeat again, this is specifically for the Tom Yum soup dish. Other dishes may be better, but I wasn't willing to come back to try. Service was fine, a bit slow but they were busy so it's understandable. The restaurant itself is very quaint and cozy, there is dim but good lighting and an open front window-bar-thing that allows you to face the street which was nice. This is what's allowing me to give this place 3 stars. But TLDR: don't order the Tom Yum.",

W all the amazing aromas it was hard to decide which to settle on so I went w the classic pad see ew w mixed veg. My companion went for the wonton noodle soup; they both came within ten minutes or so and were just heaping. While mine could have gone lighter on the sauce, the soup was perfect. We both left satisfied and unable to finish the plates. Will have to try the many other delights and note that it's worth waiting for!",

Note this place doesn't take reservations at lunch for groups smaller than 6, and even then it's best to book in advance online or by phone.Once seated, staff came by twice to take drinks orders then again for food. Shortly after, maybe 10 minutes our food came out and portions were spot on. I was worried they would be a little on the smaller side based on some of the pictures I've seen, but I shouldn't have worried. These portions will fill you up, but not to bursting, meaning you will still be able to have that dessert you were eyeing up, or leave you content to go without.I had a delicious pork Krapow which came with rice and a fried egg. It was delicious and the egg was perfectly fried so that the egg yolk was still runny. Mmmm.Luckily this place is on my work doorstep so it will be the place of choice for many a foodie occasion!It won't be long till I've tried everything on the menu. And I can reassure you, that's no bad thing.",

Back in mid-October of last year we attended for dinner with a group of around 10. Unfortunately, all went well except for my dish and a colleague's...which arrived 30 minutes after the rest of the table. Womp, womp. You can see why I wasn't quick to return, even though the food was quite tasty. I made a mental note to return. Last weekend I finally made it. After a few cocktails at J + A Cafe (yes, they have a bar at night, and you should go) we walked over to KIN. I was able to make a reservation online, but what's this? I didn't need one...it was just us and one other couple in the whole restaurant. Meaning, my dishes all arrived quite promptly :) The Singapore noodles were solid, the spring rolls fresh and fragrant and my relationship with KIN repaired. It's a great play on SE Asian street food, friendly staff, affordable, and tucked away on Leather Lane. Gets busy during midweek lunch with the office dwellers, but if you are seeking a nice dinner out that won't break the bank and has a casual vibe, I highly recommend KIN. Would be great for a group too -- I suppose, they have a few areas that communal tables can be sorted. I think that first visit was a fluke, so 4 stars for the Singapore noodles and second chances!",

But as our dinner carried on, the restaurant got more and more full until it was pretty packed, around 8:30/9pm - so reservations might be in order later in the evening. We took advantage of the check in deal, which is now 20% off (rather than the former 30%) if you order a starter+main, or main+dessert, from the a la carte menu. We decided to share a starter, have two mains, and share a dessert:- salt and pepper tofu, \u00a34- pad kee mao (drunken noodles) with prawns \u00a38.3- wonton dumpling soup noodles with pork, \u00a37.2- banana fritters with coconut ice cream, \u00a33.8Everything was lovely. We were really satisfied with our choices. The salt and pepper tofu is a great way to start because it's flavor-packed, but light and airy, leaving room for mains! The pad kee mao, while advertised as super-spicy, was not hot at all to my desensitized palate, but was super-tasty. I asked for extra chilis on the side and was obliged :) The dumplings in the soup were perfectly cooked and the broth was really flavorful while the ramen noodles in the soup were a pleasant balance of soft and chewy. And oh, the dessert! Amazing. Since I'm lactose intolerant, they were happy to serve the ice cream and the fritters separate, so I had the fritters (and a tiny nibble of ice cream - a match made in heaven to have the two together) and my friend had the ice cream and a few bites of the fritters. There's optional golden syrup to go on top - opt in for that, definitely! Delicious dinner, totally cute ambience, accessible location, and friendly, attentive service all added up to a great dining experience!",

The starters of spring rolls and salt and pepper squid were amazing but the mains were so average. Both mains were lacking depth of flavour. We were pretty disappointed. To top it off we waited such a long time we had to ask twice where our mains were. We got a small apology from the waitress.

Walking into a mostly empty restaurant on a Thursday would normally send up a red flag, but I figured it's location on Leather Lane made it more of a lunch place. Needless to say, we immediately were seated at a nice table and received superb service. My companion had the Nasi Goreng, while I had the Singapore Noodles with tofu. We both enjoyed our meals and my portion was huge. It's great that they offer a vegan option for many of their dishes -- meaning I have lots of dishes to go back and try. They also had a list of delicious sounding cocktails that I will be back for! The decor was nice, with a very comfortable feel. I enjoyed my food more at Bintang, but the ambiance, location and service wins at KIN! Once I try the other options at KIN, I may have to revise that statement!",

We arrived at KIN as a group of 7 people and as soon as the door swung open I was taken back by the warmth coming form inside, I'm not talking about the temperature warmth, I'm talking about the warmth exuding from the staff. We were seated at the rear of the quaint restaurant on a long wooden bench and to my delight our table was already stocked up with large trough like bowls of prawn crackers and ramekins of sweet chili dip. I always think this is a nice touch in Asian restaurants and should really be the norm because who doesn't like prawn crackers? The food was incredible - I had the prawn Pad Thai for main which is deceptively filling, so don't be a fool like me and fill up on prawn crackers, chicken skewers and satay sauce before your main. I loved the authenticity of the Pad Thai, some places attempt it but don't quite capture the flavor but this one was created to perfection. Despite the fact my stomach was full to the brim I pushed myself over the edge by ordering the green tea ice cream. It was an interesting desert, I wouldn't say I loved it but I kept eating it. I suppose it intrigued me! The ambiance of KIN was excellent, there is a real relaxed atmosphere and as the evening drew in they lowered the lights creating a cosy bar like feel rather than a restaurant. Overall I really enjoyed the food, ambiance and my company for the evening. I definitely KIN was a KINdred spirit!",
