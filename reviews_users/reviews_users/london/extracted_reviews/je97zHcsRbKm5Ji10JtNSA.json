    "text": "If you want amazing sushi without the Nobu price, Dinings is your answer. Located in a nondescript townhouse in Marlybone, Dinings serves some of the best sushi in London. In fact, the owner is a former chef at Nobu and has branched out on his own. The small, sleek, and minimal interior has a sushi bar on the ground level and a seating area with small tables on the lower ground floor. You come here for quality sushi and that's what you get. I ordered tuna, toro, yellowtail, tempura king crab, eel roll, spicy tuna roll, and a foie gras special. They were all delicious and I ordered more. The staff was attentive, perhaps too much so. But that didn't matter or affect my experience at this fish lovers heaven. Check it out, you too might become a Dinings addict.",

The restaurant is tiny - maybe room for 25 in total? \u00a0We were squeezed in the low-ceiling'd basement which felt slightly claustrophobic (but I'm tall), and I was also a bit bothered by the brightness and sterility of the room - I know sushi places are customarily minimalist, but this borders on the medicinal.",

Lunch set is how you should start, around \u00a310-\u00a315 you have very fresh sashimi, and the chic fusion food. I love their Chirashi (sashimi on sushi rice), Salmon Tartar Don (you have to check if it is the daily special, then it would only be \u00a38.90 for a three course set), salmon donburi (if there is no salmon tartar), and their teriyaki dishes are nice too. The place is small, so you should book a table. Sushi lover will choose to sit at the counter to see the chef's art of making sushi. Have recommended it to many of my friends and they are now Dinings fans.",

The interior is nicely pleasant and humble though and it is easy to feel relaxed and just enjoy the food. The chef used to work at Nobu earlier and you can tell that the menu is a bit different from your normal Japanese restaurant. There were just too many things to choose from on the menu that sounded great. Settling on trying a few different items I have to say that all the food was very impressive. Highlights included the salmon and miso tartar chip, seabass carpaccio with ponzu jelly and truffle oil and the wonderful seared Wagyu beef with Korean spicy miso. All dishes were superbly cooked and really tasty. Service was great - very unobtrusive and they knew how to space the dishes out so the wait was never too long but it was not an avalanche of food either. Highly recommend it, will definitely go again.",

She ordered:- Nigri sushi and Sashimi (combination of fish and hand roll)- Eel and Foie Gras- Beef Steak- Grilled chili garlic black codThe presentation of the sushi is superb and the sushi itself was divine!

We sat at the bar (which is where anyone serious about having a really good experience at a sushi joint should sit) and ordered omakase. \u00a0Next time we go back, I think we'll probably stick with our typical nigiri pieces. \u00a0The fish was really fresh, but there seemed to be an awful lot of vinegar involved in most of the preparations. \u00a0And the lack of Japanese fish was a little sad. Overall, a good experience, and fairly near our flat, which is even better (read: \u00a0not in Ealing like Sushi Hiro). \u00a0We'll definitely be back, even if \u00a0we do have to make a reservatin for Saturday night three weeks in advance!",

    "text": "And while places like Roka are brilliant and all that, what I really love about Dinings is its unpresumptuous fa\u00e7ade ~ a tiny little Japanese restaurant with a simple sushi bar and a small, brightly lit restaurant area that seats I don't know, 30 at most, serving up in complete modesty what I think is up there with the best Japanese food in Londontown. Big call, little one. Big call, but trust me, they deliver. I'm not going to go into a clinical dissection of every dish in this post, because frankly, you should just go and experience this yourself. But I do have to point out the seared wagyu beef sushi with truffle salsa & ponzu jelly which at \u00a39 for two portions, is definitely the most expensive sushi to have ever passed these lips. But they're that ridiculously good that despite the expense, they've passed these lips quite a number of times. In fact I did say to Panu that I'd be quite happy to pay \u00a336 for eight portions and call that my dinner. And honestly, I would. But I'm greedy, and I wanted to try other stuff. Every single dish is a star in its own right. The wagyu beef tataki, foie gras sushi (which I've heard others not liking because the foie gras is served warm but I, for one, relished it), grilled scallops with creamy wasabi sauce the winners just kept on coming. And they don't stop there. Dinings has a small but quality dessert menu, including green tea cr\u00e8me brulee which OMG I didn't order! I was itching to try the hoji tea pannacota (delicious, not too sweet with a distinct tea bite) and Panu had the black sesame cr\u00e8me caramel topped with coffee froth because I was raving non-stop about that. So there you go, a too-well-kept London secret unveiled and now y'all just have to go and check it out. And whatever you do, whatever you order, just don't be stingy. Go for the seared wagyu beef sushi, I promise you won't regret it.",

I noticed they had about 1 server per two or three tables (on a Sat night) - so service is absolutely top notch. They can help you with recommendations for food as well as alcohol. They have quite a selection of seasonal sake - you can ask if they have other ones in stock as well.We had quite a lot of different small dishes.

    "text": "Make your reservation for Dinings now! This small, Japanese restaurant in Marylebone can be completely booked even a week in advance if not more. We tried our luck with the waitlist, and I was so happy to hear there was an open table during the first seating! The menu at Dinings changes, so your favourites may not be available at the next visit. However, this could just be an excuse to try everything now!My recommendations:- Toro fatty tuna w/ wasabi- Tempura zucchini flowers- Grilled chili garlic black cod- Tempura strawberries w/ balsamic ice creamThe grilled chili garlic black cod is amazing, and hands-down my favourite dish from that night. The meat easily flakes off the skin, and the light chili sauce complements the fish perfectly. The special open sushi roll \"Capricciosa\" is also a really fun dish. You don't really know what you'll be getting as the chef selects the fish to top your rolls. Each one is different and some were pretty extravagantly decked out. You really can't go wrong with Dinings. The service is great, the sashimi is so fresh, and the combination of flavours are amazing. Make sure to check out their hand-written specials menu too!",

    "text": "I took my boyfriend to Dinings for his birthday lunch and we had a great meal. My foodie Japanese friend recommended this place, so we traveled across town all the way from East London. And it certainly didn't disappoint. The restaurant is very small, with only sushi bar seating on the top floor (less than 10 seats) and 7-8 tables in the basement. You should definitely make reservations, as the restaurant was packed for lunch on a Saturday and I can only imagine how difficult it will be to try to have dinner there. The food is Japanese fusion served tapas style. The menu is quite big with several sections: nibbles, cold tapas, hot tapas, lunch specials, sushi, and rolls. We decided to order from each of the section to sample a variety of dishes. We started with one scallop and one lobster tar-tar chips, which are tiny bite-sized tacos. We loved those fresh and flavorful bites. Then we had seaweed salad, miso aubergine, scallops and their signature dish - grilled chill garlic black cod. Everything was really tasty, but nothing quite stood out for me. What really captured my heart was the Wagyu Beef steak donburi. OMG, I was in heaven. The beef was very tender and cooked to perfection. The meat was so soft that it literally melted in my mouth. I could eat this for lunch everyday, but at a hefty 25 pounds a pop, it is just a once in a blue moon treat. We got so full that we didn't even get a chance to try to sushi or rolls here. Since it is a birthday celebration, we have to have a dessert and we had the black and white sesame custard type of thing and I liked it a lot - Not too bit, not too sweet, just about right. The services are quite nice as well. I informed them of the occasion before hand and they prepared a nice birthday dessert plate and a candle. I definitely will have to come back to try to fresh sashimi others raved about.",

    "text": "Unquestionably really good sushi and sashimi, some of the freshest and most innovative in London. Their hot food and sauces were brilliant as well, there's no doubt that Dining is a step up above other Japanese restaurants in London. For the food, 5/5. However, it is rather pricey for a casual dining environment. The service was great though, and if I could give this place 4.5 stars, I would, but 4 stars will have to do!Some recommendations:1) Eel and foie gras roll - just an amazing combination!2) Seabass and truffle carpaccio3) 4-appetiser sampler - great way to have a taste of four very different flavoursI wouldn't go for the tar-tar chips though. Trying to be too inventive, styled on mini-tacos from Mexico. But the potato \"chip\" was just too thin and an acrid fried taste. Didn't work.",

The fish quality was top notch (very fresh handrolls) and the salmon teriyaki lunch I ordered perfectly prepared.Main criticisms: my two dining companions and I were a party of three sitting a table pretty clearly designed for three and the service was a little slow.",

While the food was good, portions were tiny, prices were high, and staff had a bit too much attitude, I don't mind smiles, but most were grinning like a cheshire cat throughout the night despite some really poor service.To start off, the cheapest two bottles of Sauvingon Blanc Wine on the menu were 'unavailable', so we settle for nearest alternative - the Mansion Bay House at \u00a338.20. However later when they ran out of the Mansion Bay, we are informed that actually they have some of the cheaper stuff available by the glass (might have been nice to know at the start of our meal.)Our tiny Kelp Salad at almost six pounds was less than a mouthful, the Sea Bass sashimi at \u00a36.95 was two tiny pieces. We enjoyed our Kizami Salmon Roll, Cornish Spider Crab Avocado rolls, Edamame and some 'late but lovely' Nasu miso Aubergine. However the dishes took forever to arrive. When we called the waiter over to ask for another drink, the waiter assuming we are inquiring about the late food snaps back at us 'It's coming, the food is coming'. Fed up with the tiny sushi plates, we decide to splurge and order the pan Fried Whole Lobster at \u00a347.60, after a bottle of wine, and a sudden turn in our spending power, the waiters suddenly seem more attentive, offering us more drinks. We end with a dessert of Yuzu Shochu Pannacotta - not great.Finally to add insult to injury the bill arrives and they've doubled up all the dishes we've ordered, to the less attentive diner one might assume this was a natural charge as there were two of us and perhaps many of the cash rich diners here may not question this, but this seemed to me like a sly trick. I scroll down the menu, and an extra appetizer and three extra main courses have been added to our bill, with the doubling up of all the sushi, the bill is over \u00a3100 dearer than it should be. Strangely as soon as I call the waiter over, holding the bill up - and without even having to explain, he announces there is a problem with our bill, again with his Cheshire Grin. I find this strange that he knew this before we said anything. The whole experience left a bad taste in our mouths, and I wouldn't be surprised if this happens 'by mistake on purpose' to quite a few 'merry' diners. Aside from the mains we didn't order, there was no reason the dishes we did have should have tallied twice. After all this, they even left the service on!Unlikely to return...",

The orgasmic mouthfuls I felt last night were memorable in a way that only a few other experiences have been (for example, truffle gnocchi pillows on a vineyard in Chianti and 'the Tomato' at Alan Wong's in Hawaii).Some of my favourite items were:Half-seared salmon sushi with fresh wasabi\"Nasu Miso\" Aubergine with Sweet MisoGrilled Chilli Garlic Black CodBut these items... these things were giggle inducing and made me feel things that made me understand why puritanical protestants were against food-induced bodily pleasures:Seared Wagyu beef Sushi with topped Truffle Salsa & Ponzu JellySeabass Carpaccio with Ponzu Jelly and Truffle SalsaHalf-seared o-toro tuna sushi with fresh wasabiTempura-fried Strawberries with Balsamic-Mirin Ice CreamThese had the 'wow, I've never tasted anything like this' factor. Note that the first two have a very similar preparation, but I could not choose between the two as they were both glorious and absolutely gorgeous. You could smell the fragrant truffles from other tables... Moreover, this is an excellent use of truffle, not just an added thing to make it sound expensive. The wagyu beef was perfectly marbled and had a obscenely velvety texture, and the sea bass Carpaccio was of the best quality.The o-toro was magically kissed by the fresh wasabi (which, if you've never had it, is a completely different thing from the neon green paste), and the tempura strawberries were phenomenal, accompanied by the most interesting ice cream I've ever had. It sounds weird, but it just works. The mirin/balsamic was sweet and flavourful, not sharp or alcoholic tasting in the slightest. It was 'whoa... that's crazy! and delicious!' ice cream like I've never had (and I've tried some strange ice creams).Thank you, Dinings, for making my life a better place. This is an establishment to spend some money at without a hint of regret. Next time, I want to sit at the sushi bar.",

    "text": "this should have been a 5 star review.read on to find out why it is not!nonetheless, dinings is still the best japanese restaurant in london till date.the main entrance leads you into the sushi bar.and the main dining area with table seating is in the basement.the toilets though cramped, are very clean and modern looking.service is attentive and friendly.menu is extensive and well worth reading.:)we settled for the gen mai tea which is green tea leaves with roasted brown rice.to start we were served standard miso soup.clear and not overpowering miso flavour but the pieces of tofu in the hot soup was cold!!! we made our objection known to the waitress who immediately apologised for it.next our king crab tempura with spicy taramo sauce.the meat of the king crab is wrapped in shiso leaf and seaweed then the package is tempura fried.the meat though sweet was not distinctive.the spicy light fish roe sauce did lift the taste slightly.the char grilled iberian pork is to die for!however, it's not quite in the mould of traditional japanese cuisine.it was very tapas like.but very well done.maybe slightly heavy handed with the salt but the taste of the yuzu and lemon balanced it off somewhat.the pork was heavenly, nicely charred but tender.we also shared the sushi roll and chirashi.the chirashi came with a choice of sashimi salad or mixed tempura on the side.what impressed me most about the chirashi was the saba.it was very fresh and not overly vinegared!you get tuna, saba, salmon, scallops, ikura, tamago, ebi and snapper on top of a bed of sushi rice.not premium cuts but at 15 quid, you cannot really complain.the 15 piece sushi roll set was made up of mainly reverse rolls.the vegetarian one that was wrapped in daikon on the outside was refreshing indeed. more like a vietnamese summer roll.and we dipped it with the special dinings sauce that was meant for the side salad.it worked amazingly together!something about the sauce just taste so good.but just as i was about to polish off the last of the reversed salmon roll i bit into something that should not be there!a 1 cm long bone from the salmon was embedded in the sushi roll!no real damage was done to me physically but this was a real thorn in an otherwise memorable meal!we rightfully complained to the waitress about it and she swears that this is the first time something like that has happened.thus, this is the main reason why i cannot give them 5 stars! sigh.we decided to finish our meal with the yuzu and champagne sorbet.and that did not disappoint at all.very citrus and alcohol laden!a very good palate cleanser indeed.in the end, the waitress waived her service charge.which though a nice act on her part is not the right thing to do in our opinion.i.e. there was nothing wrong with her service but clearly the fault of the sushi chef and kitchen staff.as long as they can fix what i believe to be minor imperfections, they will win that fifth star in no time.",

    "text": "We were in London for the weekend and met up with our good friends who luckily had reservations at Dinings. \u00a0We have been to Dinings a couple of years before and had a great experience. \u00a0We couldn't wait to go again.Food: To make it easy we went with the omakase. \u00a0Our menu was the following:1) Toro Tar Tar Chip2) Wagyu Tar Tar Chip 3) Appetizer 4 Ways (4 tasting spoons per person) 4) Chargrilled Lamb Cutlets with Sakura Saikyo Spicy Miso Sauce and Seasonal Vegetables5) Grilled Chili Garlic Black Cod6) Aubergine \"Nasu Miso\"7) Burikama - Salt Grilled Yellowtail Collar8) Nigiri Special Toro \"Shimofuri\" with Malden and Black Pepper9) Nigiri Seared Razor Clam with Yuzu Kosho and Lemon10) Nigiri Yuzu Garlic Yellowtail with Caviar Sushi11) Nigiri Japanese Wagyu Beef Sushi with Truffle Salsa12) Spicy Tuna Roll13) Double Crab Roll14) Seabass Carpaccio with Fresh Truffle15) Mixed Berries with Green Tea Cream Cheese and Apricot Yuzu Sorbet16) Yuzu Posset with Shortbread and Raspberries*Everything was DELICIOUS and full of flavor!!Drinks: We ordered one bottle of sake, two glasses of white wine and three beers.Price: It's not cheap. \u00a0For the four of us we paid \u00a3606.21. \u00a0In hindsight we shouldn't have ordered the extra 8 pieces of the Special Toro Shimofuri nigiri because they added an extra \u00a371.80 to the bill - yikes - but they are so good.Service: Excellent service. \u00a0We had an Italian woman who was very helpful, professional and friendly.Ambiance: It's a very very small restaurant with a small sushi bar upstairs and about 20 seats downstairs, so there's no real ambiance per se, but you go for the food. \u00a0Other: My only \"complaint\" I have is that, as expensive as this restaurant is (and me being Asian), they should really invest in nice chopsticks. \u00a0They have the crappy cheap disposable chopsticks you get when you order take away, which have splinters when you break them apart. \u00a0I really feel this is unacceptable, especially because 1) there are not that many seats in the restaurant itself so they can definitely afford nice chopsticks and 2) having nice cutlery is part of the whole dining experience.Would I go back? Absolutely, but with my own chopsticks :) We have tried many of the high end Japanese restaurants in London and feel that Dinings is definitely one of the best. \u00a0It's not a place where you can go all the time since it's very expensive, but it's definitely a place to celebrate a special occasion.",

Our server failed to bring us the miso-glazed eggplant tapa we ordered and then brought us the double crab roll which we did not order. For a restaurant at this price point, servers really should be more attentive and accurate. Had service been on-point I would've given 5-stars as the food truly is deserving of the highest rating.",

    "text": "My son is a fan of Japanese food and wanted to take him somewhere special for his birthday. \u00a0The reviews did it for me, but boy was I disappointed. There is no ambiance as it's quite small and casual - maybe this was my fault for not investigating more. \u00a0Our area only had our table and two more. So much for dressing up - everyone was casual and wearing jeans and trainers. I have been to the Nobu restaurants, Zuma and also Umu amongst other well known brands. \u00a0Had I known what I was about to experience, I should have gone back to them. At least this would have been special for my son.*Appetiser 4 ways was good*Panko deep fried Asparagus wrapped w/ Wagyu beef was nothing special and greasy*Seabass carpaccio with truffle was tasty but a little too lemony/zesty*We ordered two Garlic Yellowtail sashimi with caviar and one regular but received them the other way round. They said we get to keep the second regular as a compliment and would bring out second garlic yellowtail, but never did. \u00a0(In the end, they took this one yellowtail off the bill b/c of mistake)*3 pc spicy Kizami salmon roll was very good*The inside out rolls were good, except the fatty tuna had crunchy bits inside and that was unexpected and a turnoff. They explained what the ingredient is but.... NO.We started at 9:30, it took a while to get the waiter to come take our order. I had to make him repeat the specials/way of ordering, several times, as the woman at the table next to us was so loud I couldn't hear him. Yes, the tables are that close.By the time we waited for our last sushi rolls and everything else was finished we looked at our watches at 10:25 - the rolls arrived at 10:50pm, which was ridiculous. They knew it was taking long and even apologised, but being a week night, we wanted dessert for my son's birthday, but it was too late and we were just anxious to get the bill. Although our waiter was nice enough and acknowledged the issues, for the type of prices you pay here, you'd expect a lot more for what you get. Needless to say, waiter offered to take the service charge off the bill without us even requesting.If you want casual, yet excellent Japanese, try Jin Kichi in Hampstead or Oka in Primrose Hill or their other location. \u00a0I wish I went back there - but like I said, wanted a different place for my son to experience for his birthday. Let down.",

    "text": "I had one night in London and I wanted to find a nice place to eat. Most of my friends suggested Indian or Chinese restaurants but being a sushi fanatic I decided to find the best sushi spot around. My first choice happened to be closed, so I decided to visit Dinings. I was able to make a reservation a few days out and they asked if I'd be willing to sit at the sushi bar (of course). I walked into the restaurant and it was just a tiny room with a sushi bar - I assume the larger restaurant is downstairs but I didn't see it. The food was really excellent. I tried a number of recommended dishes and finished with a solid assortment of nigiri. The fish quality was excellent but the rice was a little basic. Better than most sushi places but not near the top restaurants in NYC and elsewhere. \u00a0The service was a little odd - I'm not sure if that's just London or this particular restaurant. The chef behind the bar was busy but very friendly. My waitress was slightly pushy - constantly urging me to try various things and seemingly judging me for not ordering everything she recommended. I read other reviews saying my similar things. Overall the experience was great and I highly recommend Dinings for anyone visiting London and wanting great Japanese inspired food and sushi.",

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't 'amazing!' either. Shame they didn't have the sea urchin either.The highlight was the aubergine miso - not sure how Japanese that is, but it was delicious nevertheless.I recommend bar seating if it's just the two of you, you get to see the chefs prepping your food and personally, I always enjoyed that. The place overall is tiny, which reminded me a lot of the restaurants in Japan, but not the fine dining types though... just the hidden good ones.Service was very thoughtful & attentive, however I didn't like the waitress asking twice if we wanted dessert and when politely rejected acted all surprised. Perhaps the desserts there were amazing and we totally missed out. Yet, we left feeling full & happy.",

A rich, aubergine half crackling with miso paste. That was the most decent-sized option out of all the food I ordered. The next were the tofu croquettes. Served hot as well, with a melty interior. A great starter. The scallop \"bite\" (for nearly 4 quid!!) is just that- one swallow, diced scallop in a tiny taco shell. Innovative and tasty.For two people for lunch, 67 quid. Thank god it was a source lunch! I was still hungry after though, so got a slice of pizza =(Just a note, when you enter ALL the staff says hello in Japanese, which is discombobulating.",

Having said that, the place is super tiny, as a single guest I was seated at the bar - which I can understand but still find a bit annoying, as if singles don't deserve a table - I could barely fit my legs under there and then the lady suggested I put my bag on one of the hooks underneath, like at 6'2 with a bag hanging there I just was not comfortable. As the bar is close to the door, every time it opened it would get quite chilly and when guests arrived they would all yell out something Japanese, which in the beginning I thought was funny but by the 5th time it started to annoy just a little. All in all, the people from Nobu should go here for food tips and the people from Dinnings should go to Nobu for a quick interior design class",

The sushi bar is jammed next to the front entrance and given what you pay for the food the restaurant needs to have more space and get upgraded",

    "text": "Silly expensive, and yet somehow worth it, Dinings has managed to find a strange little niche tucked between in your face \"truffle-and-fois-gras-on-everything\" luxury and casual dinner with friends. \u00a0The whole thing feels out of place like some bizarre Japanese edible version of the twilight zone - stuck in the middle of a residential block, with cozy (some would say cramped) seating and friendly staff - but by god, it pulls it off. \u00a0My advice? \u00a0Don't trust your own taste-buds, and let the staff help out out with ordering, because you will be surprised. \u00a0The tartare chips, seabass, and double crab really stood out.Oh, and I don't usually do this for Japanese restaurants, but stick around for desert. \u00a0The vanilla mochi is mind-blowingly good.",

    "text": "Good sushi is hard to come by in London, especially after having lived in Tokyo for 3 years. However Dinings is one of the best. Very nice moriawase nigiri. Pieces are on the small side which I prefer and ultra fresh. Barometer for me is the uni which was fantastic. They had a special uni nigiri on the day that included caviar. Pricey at \u00a38.50 but worth the splurge if you are an uni fan. They do lots of hot and cold dishes as well which we skipped this time but have had in the past and are excellent. Dinings also retains some of the Nobu influence with flavored sashimi/carpaccio which are nice but when he nigiri is this good why bother. As for atmosphere there is the tiny sushi bar upstairs and tables in the basement. Cozy if not cramped which is also why it's hard to book for dinner. Staff is about 50/50 Japanese/other so you get the local Japan experience depending on the server.Not cheap as you'd expect in London for sushi but worth the splurge if you want the good stuff.",

    "text": "The food here is seriously good. I've read good things about this place so booked myself a dinner here on Saturday, given the popularity I had to eat at 9pm, but it was indeed full of customers.Firstly, sushi here is very modern, you'll find lots of yuzu and truffle seasoning on raw fish, and more than the usual amount of beef sushi and pork dishes. That said, they do have traditional sashimi and sushi too, and the quality of the fish is top notch it has to be said. Definitely one of the freshest fish I've tasted outside of Asia, and certainly one of the top in London. The miso aubergine was amazing too, and I like that they've done their black cod a different way than the miso that other places do. The one here is seasoned with chilli and garlic. If I go back, I'd definitely get more of the sushi. It'd have to be a special occasion though as this place ain't cheap!",
