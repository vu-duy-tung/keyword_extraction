A short walk from Leicester Square tube and located just back from Charing Cross Road, this triangular shaped pub is packed to the (three) corners with comfy chairs and tables to spend a few hours at with your mates. There is a nice range of real ales and lagers available, and some fine pub grub on offer as well. I've heard there's live music here sometimes and friends have said it's really good then. I like the mix of tourists and office workers and passers-by. Oh, and it's close to loads of theatres - if you are going to see Spamalot then this is a good place for a pre play pint!",

It has a loyal clientele alongside the tourists and office-workers attracted, in part, by the occasional live music, such as Jazz evenings. Overall, not a bad boozer for the area.

Location wise you cannot fault it, being on the edge of Soho and Covent Garden it is handy for many a mode of public transport and any type of night out, whether it's a simple after works drink, drinks before the theatre as it's in the heart of theatreland (and right next to the Palace Theatre), casual night with mates or a night discovering new talent at their Open Mic nights, you can get it all here. More importantly, you will receive friendly and courteous service and the atmosphere in the pub is relaxed and down to earth, nothing pretentious at all. Be warned though it is always busy and you can rarely get a seat after 7pm! I'm a bit wary of raving about the pub because it will go off the scale!",

I have found Spice great for a whole bunch of different things; Karaoke downstairs, a social gathering upstairs - or during the day time using downstairs for work (they hire it out). I heard that they stopped doing karaoke a while back; which is a shame. Because it was a staple of our Sunday nights for a few months. Oh the memories. I have also seen live music here; and it's a good venue for that. Small and personal - their website says many famous acts have played here in the past, and I can understand why, it's very intimate. The staff are young, friendly and enthusiastic, which makes a big difference. Drinks aren't too expensive, from what I remember. You can do a lot worse on a night out in London. The upstairs is normally packed, you have to fight for a table. But once you've got one it's a good place to hang out; lively but not noisy if you know what I mean. This place is probably top of my list in the area for a little gathering of friends.",

The downstairs bar is smaller than the main pub and provides the perfect backdrop for an intimate gig.Accoustics are good and if you arrive early enough to grab a table (looks like it may be a good idea to book in advance) you can enjoy a meal with the music.

The drinks are reasonably priced, the decor inviting and the facilities adequate. If you go there on a Monday night, you can catch some up and coming artists performing their latest creations at the open mike night. Just don't make the same mistake we did and sit around upstairs waiting for people to whip out their guitars and break into song, only to discover that the stage and performers were all in the room downstairs. Oh, you push up on the buckle. It depends on what you are after. If you want to be serenaded, go downstairs, but note that it is unacceptable to chat while people are performing, so if you are more into a social evening with mates, stick to the upstairs section. All in all a good evening out and a good way to spice up an otherwise boring weekday.",

So for drinks and food, I can recommend this place. But then I went down for some classical music gig. It looks like a nice venue. But for some reason the staff didn't realize that everybody was freezing due to the aircon, or didn't manage to turn it down. After the first act I asked them to turn it off, but it didn't really help that much, it was just a bit less freezing than before. That was really annoying. It were these days when it was quite cold outside, so you're happy if it's warm inside. But it was not. Second, for no obvious reason the microphone and speakers were turned on while a guy played his songs on the piano. This wouldn't harm, if it wouldn't result in infrequent crackles. Not the kind of sound you enjoy. The other ensemble, Ligeti Quartet (ligetiquartet.com ), actually needed microphones, so their really good performance also suffered from the crackles caused by whatever machinery in the pub. Third, there was one obviously drunk man, who couldn't shut up. If you're at a (free!) concert and don't like the music, you just leave quietly, don't you? Not him, he had to discuss this issue with his partner. And despite some people in the audience repeatedly pointed out to the staff that this was really irritating and annoying \u00a0even one of the performers on stage commented on this behaviour \u00a0neither the staff nor the guy running the concert made an effort to get this guy out. After these shortcomings, there's not much the need to mention that the staff behind the bar were not really aware of the music and also disrupted the listening experience with dish washing and the like. It is difficult to rate this place, probably I should go back for another gig. But at this gig, despite the good food, they definitely messed up big time.",

I didn't try the food (I tried to steal someone's order but got found out. All in the name of japes.) but it all looked pretty yummy - burgers and the like! Prices aren't that bad and they have a pretty healthy (or 'unhealthy', depending on your point of view) selection of beverages. Staff seemed to be very friendly when I went, adding to the mix by having a rocker theme about them! Downstairs is quite a small live music room, probably fit about 100 people at a squeeze with a bar and toilets for convenience!

The Backstage Bar in the basement has live music every night. Monday is the open mic night and often sometimes attracts talented musicians. There's a great atmosphere downstairs and it's a brilliant place to listen to live music. They offer a selection of wines, beers and ciders all at the usual pricey London cost. However, The Spice of Life is in a superb location between Leicester Square, Covent Garden and Tottenham Court Road. If you're in the area you should definately pop in-day and night there's live music and they also serve food.

Although there's been a pub here since the 18th century, the present building dates back to 1898, and the original name (The Cantons) can still be seen on the facade. The pub has strong musical associations, first with folk music (Cat Stevens, Paul Simons and Bob Dylan played here), then with punk and more recently with jazz, although Saturdays still feature selected up-and-coming rock and acoustic acts. Th pub is now owned by McMullen, and features their real ales: Country Bitter, Cask, AK and their IPA, and the odd seasonal beer. It's a little expensive, but about par for the course for the area.

    "text": "It's safe to say this pub will definitely spice up your life! It's a Victorian style pub located in SoHo, and is designed with wood paneled walls and blue floral wallpaper. We stopped in on a Tuesday night where the special for the evening was a burger, beer and fries for only $13. I opted to try the chicken avocado burger, while my hubs ordered the four cheese burger. Both were Ahh-mazing!! The buns were buttery and crisp, and the fries were perfectly seasoned.Space feels very warm and welcoming, and the bartender greeted us like old friends. It made for a great last meal in London!",

I'm glad we decided to go in since who knew this was one of the BEST pubs in London's West End!This place was buzzin with both tourists and locals. Everyone seem to be enjoying a pint or a glass of vino. My bf didn't order anything else while we were in London except fish n chips. So that's what he had and compared to other pubs we've been, I love their fish here: no bones, crisp batter and mushy peas were so good. I've always been a skinny fries kinda gal, but their chunky sized chips here were a delight to munch on.My lamb kofta totally hit the spot. It was flavorful and moist with a small heap of couscous and onion and mint salad. The backstage bar downstairs is a neat place where you can hear live music every night of the week! (check out the website for the listings) and every Monday is open mic. A relaxed place where you can choose to chill out with friends or hear live music. With friendly bartenders, hot food that's delicious and jazzy music, What more could you ask for?",
