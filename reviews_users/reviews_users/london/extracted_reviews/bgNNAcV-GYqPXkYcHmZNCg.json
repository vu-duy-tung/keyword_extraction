The food in general is really good, so are their teas and coffees, and all for a fair price. The space is limited so we had to share a table with strangers when we went on a weekend, but I did not find it to be awkward. The service was great as well, 5 stars worthy place.",

    "text": "So down to Holloway Road I walked one cold winter's day, avoiding slipping on the ice and looking forward to the thought of enjoying breakfast at the local cafe which I had somehow previously overlooked but has over the last 12 months garnered 7 five star reviews from Yelp's elite. \u00a0First impressions were good. \u00a0The seating space had increased by 50% from early reviews (from 4 seats to 6) and I found a spot near the door.I ordered a croissant and scrambled eggs from the menu and my customary double mac. I was also given a glass of iced tap water freshened with cucumber without having to ask - a nice touch. \u00a0The coffee was huge - more like the size of a Latte which while nice, kind of misses the point. \u00a0The breakfast itself was simply presented but what can you really do with scrambled eggs and a croissant but was perfectly nice to eat. \u00a0As I ate, the kitchen brought out a series of cakes which will do doubt be devoured by locals throughout the day and I was already thinking about returning to sample a slice of the Carrot or Blueberry cake, both of which looked great.So to continue the five star tradition? Not yet - more investigation to be done. \u00a0However, four stars reflects my eagerness to do just that.",

This is a great spot to meet up with friends for a light lunch, cake, or tea (but equally a comfortable and cozy spot to dine alone). I'm really happy CYK has come to fill the void left by the now deceased (and much missed) I Made It For You that occupied the space prior to CYK's move from Holloway Road. Welcome to Pitfield Street!

It gets a little less yup and a little too yob.Which is why I never discovered the Curious Yellow Kafe till the very day I left the city. Midway up Holloway Road is this teeny little cafe, and as the previous reviewer wrote, it's something a bit special. Welcoming and friendly, I instantly turned to Larissa D. and said 'Total Win!'. \u00a0Freshly baked cakes, delicious baguettes and bagels on offer. Not even to mention the blackboard of breakfasts and lunch specials including Swedish meatballs, Gravad salmon and Eggs Benedict. \u00a0The highlight of our visit was a slice of pumpkin and chocolate cake that was so dense and moist we had to order two. Amazing. The owner of Curious was working the day we visited and she was so sweet and chatty. A small child was slurping up his spaghetti and banging his plastic toy onto her nice, wooden table but she smiled indulgently and you could tell she loved meeting her customers. I asked for a bagel and they were all out so she baked me a fresh one... After also blending me a fresh lemonade. It's probably a good thing I never discovered Curious earlier, because I know that I would stop visiting all other coffee shops and pledge allegiance to this wonderful little place.",

It is THE best...yuuummmm....I was visiting friends in London & looking for places to go for coffee & cakey eats and a few cool Yelpy folk recommended this cafe (or Kafe). I am SO glad they did. Bonus also being none of my lovely London friends had been here either so it was a very pleasant surprise for them too (one of my friends actually works just around the corner from here so she was even more overjoyed to discover the place). It was a beautiful hot, sunny day (remember them? *sigh*) when we arrived here & it was more out of the way than I had anticipated but we found it eventually, sadly upon arriving there were no tables outside free (one of my friends was heavily pregnant at the time & couldn't bare the heat inside) so I thought the game was up but then luckily a party of people left so we quickly pounced on their table like an excitable kitten. Yas. I liked the laid-back feel to the place, the staff were all lovely & I liked the (mostly) IKEA retro-feel cups & glassware. The toilet is also quite quaint ~ instead of regular handles they have used forks which I thought was a nice wee, quirky touch.This place does Scandinavian inspired food & they had all their dishes written on a blackboard. A lot of the dishes here are veggie/vegan but not all of them. My friends opted for some light bites (sandwich/bagel and a veggie 'sausage' roll) whilst I went for the Scandinavian Breakfast (\u00a37.50) which is served only at the weekends. It was really good ~ a big plate with gravlax, ham, pate, cheese, crudites, pickles/gherkins & also bread & butter. Super tasty. I knew I was going to get the (now infamous) chocolate & beetroot cake because well, just BECAUSE, so I thought the Scandi Brekkie wouldn't actually be as large as it was (still, I ain't complaining!) meaning I did have to wait a while between breakfast & cake but that just meant more time to relax, drink good coffee and enjoy the surroundings. When the clock struck I knew it was indeed cake o'clock; this was what I had been waiting for and I really hoped I wouldn't be disappointed...HELL NO! The chocolate & beetroot cake with it delicious frosting was absolutely divine. I didn't want that cake to end...so moist, so tasty, so YES! I was happy the whole time I was here at the CYK but upon leaving I got sad, realising that this was probably the last time I would savour that delicious cake for a good while yet...and so I sat & hoped that one day those lovely people at CYK would come to Glasgow & open up one of their cafes so I could have my regular fix of C&B cake. Uh. PLEASE! (Thank you)",

The chocolate beetroot cake has been mentioned 1000x for good reason. It's excellent and worth stopping in for alone, with delicious poppyseed frosting. The Scandinavian breakfast set is also delicious and quite light while being generous portion wise.Best tables are the large ones in the bay windows. Mind that the place gets quite busy for weekend brunch, and that the kitchen closes during weekday afternoons (seems like sometime after 2). There are still lots of pastries and sandwiches for when that happens.",

I am totally obsessed with their 'cinnamon buns'. They can warm them up for you. AMAZING. I could eat them every single day :)I like going there to have breakfast before work or during the weekend. They make delicious 'Egg Benedicts', fantastic homemade bakery and great coffee and fresh juices! I never been there during lunch time (I have to, no excuses!)Besides, the staff is pretty awesome :)",

It has tables outside, which I hope to use as soon as the weather will allow it (yes, I still believe we could have some nice days in London!), and the interior is just \"cute\": familiar, colored, it reminds me of the exhibition in IKEA but more authentic, more \"house\" (damn, did I really use quotation marks twice?! that means a lot about how much I like this place!).Lunch time: menu on chalk, which I love, simple, home-made cuisine with a deep influence from nordic countries: potatoes salad, meatballs with raspberry jam, saumon and so on.. something not that easy to find in London!! Very well made sandwiches and nice beverages (try the homemade lemonade!).. What else?Oh yes! People working there are actually NICE: friendly, smiling, they will make you feel among friends in less than a minute! That's something really hard to find in London, and that's why I fell in love with this place!Suggested, no better, recommended, even more, just go there and smile!!",

It's no larger than the average flat's bedroom, so don't expect to bring your laptop and sit for hours on end. But this small caf\u00e9 knows exactly what it's doing and it proves to do it very, very well.Hand-pulled espresso, a bookshelf full of loose leaf tea to sniff at will and a lovely lunch selection offering Swedish delights like fresh feta and beetroot salad, cauliflower risotto, gravlx salas with mustard dill and mayo with rye bread and of course Sweden's infamous meatballs. Top that off with a cake or tart that's baked in house and you'll see exactly as I did why 5-stars is perfectly accurate. I mean, they cure their own fish. Ikea, who? This is the only Swedish-influenced lunch I need in my life!",

The freshly homemade baked goods, the hand-pulled espresso drinks, the delicious tea blends -- these are all things that give this place top marks. Add to that the incredibly friendly business owner and obviously local regulars (a testament to any caf\u00e9's greatness), and it's head of the class.I spent a mere three hours in this tiny caf\u00e9 space on Saturday, and I'm all the happier for it.",

At Curious Yellow there are around 10 or more teas to choose from with interesting blends such as the Studio 54, Ceylon tea infused with champagne and strawberries and decorated with sun and corn flower! And an array of pastries and cakes to get you in the mood for some serious scoffage. I chose a Bombay Chai and a Chocolate Square. My god, how I still crave the gooey crunch of that chocolatey heaven. I admit, I haven't been for lunch yet, but the menu is positively inspired and the sandwiches look like they've been blessed by the buttcheeks of cherubs. Prices aren't bad at all, especially considering the excellent ingredients (Cold Cured wild salmon on organic rye from Kent!) The owner was working the day I visited and she was so friendly and welcoming. It has a chilled out atmosphere and not a hint of food snobbery or pretension! Lovely jubbly!A word of warning though, the cafe itself is very small, so get there early to avoid disappointment. Shun the chocolate squares at your peril.",

    "text": "Curious has a crazy delicious croissant with scrambled eggs and bacon. As a well-traveled Anglophile, I'd place the bacon squarely in the meaty purgatory of streaky (American) and fatty (British).The coffee is very good, with the small exception that their Americanos are so hot they could literally melt through the Earth's crust were you to accidentally spill some on the ground.The service is a bit slow, especially when it's busy and raining outside (translation: always), but that can be forgiven for the cost - the aforementioned runs a paltry 6.30 GBP. You could eat here for a week for the same cost as some posh brunch joints.",

I haven't yet tried the Scandinavian breakfast(weekends only) but I will if I ever get tired of the bacon bap! \u00a0They have delicious looking cakes which they make on site. \u00a0 And they make ice coffee the way it should be made ( with crushed iced!) I can't wait t they all know me by name but it's only a matter of time because I get a bacon bap at least once a week!",

    "text": "Yes, yet another review of the best care in London, but I promise, I've new info to bring to the table, if you just read on...I found this place on Yelp and had been meaning to go for ages. Now, it's my guilty pleasure. I have fully incorporated it into my weekend ritual. Every Saturday, and in this case Sunday, I drag my drunk/hungover arse out of bed and go to my morning yoga class. After I sweating out the alcohol I make my way Curious Yellow Kafe. Before you arrive, accept the fact that you very well may need to sit outside. This place is cozy. Although it's in Hoxton/Shoreditch, it's located on a relatively quiet street. When the weather's nice, they leave the door open so you can still enjoy the tunes playing inside. The problem I have with the cafe is a big one- the food is SO good that it takes everything in my power not to lick the plate clean. How dare they make Eggs Benedict that good! I mean really, who do they think they are?! I can't control myself! I inhale them.Which takes me to my next point, the quality of the food is incredible!! I paid \u00a37.50 for a smoked salmon salad, and there was at least \u00a35 worth of smoked salmon on it. It's worth trying things that may be out of your comfort zone because everything here is good - including the coffee.Now for the best part: they're opening a deli two doors down!! It will be called Summer with Monika, opening in a couple weeks. Much bigger space and a larger seating area. Moving from Dublin last year was hard, London is so big! But now, I've found my place. I recognise the faces inside, and I know I'll always be taken care of here. Love you, CYK x x x",

    "text": "I was slightly skeptical arriving at The Curious Yellow Cafe as it didn't look so great from the outside and also very small. What have I learnt? Don't judge a book by its cover! Firstly the staff were very warm and welcoming taking our order quickly without being intrusive. We both ordered the vegetarian breakfasts and banana shakes. Both were outstanding. I almost felt guilty as I watched one of the staff leave and return 5 minutes lately with fresh bananas especially for us. There was no 'sorry that's not available.' The breakfast was by far the best vegetarian breakfast I've had since being in London. All prepared and cooked right in front of our eyes in the small kitchen behind the counter so we could see what was going into our food. I must make a special mention to the scrambled eggs. I'm not quite sure what she did but they were delicious! Soft but not runny and sweet and savoury at the same time.Lastly even though it was only 10.30am we opted for a slice of chocolate beetroot cake as we had heard great things. Who could have ever guessed this could be such a great combo! The beetroot made the cake soft and moist but without overpowering the chocolate and the icing completed the masterpiece.This will definitely be on my most recommended cafes list!",

The food displayed is quite obviously home-made and presented very much so. The staff are nice and we ended up ordering a mocha chino, swedish breakfast as it's not something you see everyday, banana smoothie and chocolate beet cake.Service was quick and we got stuck in.The Swedish breakfast is something really easy to put together and was excellent. Essentially some pate, veg, Gravlax, bread/crackeds. I loved the bread. The salmon was supposed to be a raw salmon \"Gravlax\" but to me this just tasted like smoked salmon. My unrefined taste-buds perhaps. The cappuccino was too strong for me, not enough choc, but great quality coffee beans. The banana smoothie, Heaven. I was a little disappointed with the Choc beetroot cake. You couldn't really taste the beetroot, but I'll believe they were in there.So everything food wise was okay/good with nothing standout as I was expecting. It was a nice cafe in a nice location, but without a real reason to return unless this is your local.",
