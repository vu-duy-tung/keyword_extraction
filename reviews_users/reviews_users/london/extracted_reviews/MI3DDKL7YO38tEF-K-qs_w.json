    "text": "An intimate, candlelit setting by the water for a casual but slightly romantic Sunday night date. I love tapas, standard. Who wouldn't? Bravas Tapas is a little more up market without a hefty jump in price. We opted for 6 dishes between two of us, which was perfect for a late, light dinner. The Iberian pork belly was deliciously succulent. So yummy in fact that it was a little hard to share!I'd recommend trying the Seabass fillet as well, it was cooked to perfection with crispy skin and presented on top of a tasty dressing. We asked the waitress for a wine recommendation, and she suggested a Catalan red. Whilst at \u00a332 it was more than I'd normally pay for wine at dinner (reds started from \u00a316 a bottle), it was incredible. A lovely smooth, fruity, easy to drink wine that was perfect with an array of meat, fish and vegetable tapas dishes.The atmosphere was lovely and we stayed until we had to be chucked out! A sign of a good night.",

    "text": "When you see Bravas Tapas in such a perfect location, in the centre of St Katherine Docks you kind of wish the quality would be just as good. But somewhere in the back of your mind you also feel it could be another tourist trap. But I could not have doubted more wrongly as this place has probably become one of my favourite Spanish restaurant next to Jose. Even the prices were affordableAnd because there was also a 50% soft launch we ended nearly ordering everything. Almonds arrived generously in a overfilled glass container nicely coated with a sweet paprika and apparently orange zest which I couldn't taste. But these were the 'better' ones, roasted evenly, crunchy and not salty at all to aggregate my thirst. Being quite easy to pick on we did end up demolishing them. Quick to arrive were the thinly sliced cod. How they made such a tasteless fish into something so extraordinary was unbelievable. It was like ceviche with a lot of other ingredients taking a part but without the citrus juice. It was fleshy, soft and creamy with a nice bite from the radish and cleverly salted from the black olive which gave it a punch of flavour too. Just as good were the seared salmon rolled around mushrooms and truffle. As it was served cold the flavours became more delicate and light. The salmon was so soft and buttery that it didn't take long to melt away in your mouth without being too mushy and together with the creamy sauce, it was a delight. After two impressive fish tapas the Seabass became ordinary although still really good. I would have preferred if it was cooked a little less but a firmer texture but to compensate that it came with a lovely crispy seared skin. The flavours were also delicate using simple fresh tomato salsa to flavour it and pack it with moisture, all done with good seasoning. Now I'm not exaggerated when I say these were the best brava potatoes I have ever eaten. Yes, they're just chips but with their paprika seasoning, crisp outside falling into a fluffy fragrant potato, piping hot and dipped into that delicious sweet cooling salsa and sour cream it was epic. It was that sauce that made this dish so moorish, creamy, sweet and light and hot against cold. Too good!The toasted baguette with tomatoes were nicely toasted, crisp and using fresh tomatoes again to create that creamy slightly chunky salsa top. Would have preferred if they were more generous with the sauce but only because it was that tasty.I had very mix opinions with the spiced lamb. As tender and mouth-melting they were, texture unfaultable they lacked flavour. In fact I couldn't taste any spice at all. But for a quality simple lamb chop itself it was very good, naturally sweet with gentle flavours from the Rosemary alioli. Who would have though black pudding burgers would work so well? But it did. These sliders were amazing. Soft fluffy buttery brioche bun into something very smoky, rich, nicely spiced and gamey. Very different to the juicy meat patties I'm used to but it works. The other ingredients also added a great \u00a0textural layer element to it. So far everything has been beautifully presented but nothing could have beat the gazpacho. The beautiful bowl that resembled a fallen brandy snifter came with just the croutons and just as it reached our table the waitress poured in the refreshing sweet tomato gazpacho. The seasoning was perfect and the croutons remained crunchy throughout. I plan to order this every time I return.There was a lot of food but there's always room for a sweet dessert. The torte came as a cherry marzipan tart. Usually I disagree with using sorbet as a side of a dessert but this really worked. It brought in moisture to the dense tart, breaking up the heaviness of it. The crust was perfect, light and crumbly filled with a good thick layer of moist marzipan topping with a sweet sharp tasting of cherries and thin crunchy almonds. What I believed to be simple strawberries in white chocolate turned out to be the most impressive dessert of the year. It was served in the same glass bowl as the gazpacho, with soft macerated strawberries hidden under beautifully bubbled cava foam and a nice melting dollop of smooth sweet white chocolate. It wa indulgence with a good kick from the cava, Sweet, milky and boozy. I cannot fault Bravas Tapas. The experience was so memorable I already want to go back. I love the small menu choices with affordable pricing, the warm simple wooden decor, couches to slouch into and candles for a bit of romance, all facing the beautiful Katherine Docks itself. Service was friendly enough, quick and efficient. \u00a0A brilliant edition to the area that is filled with too many chain restaurants already.",

The food here was exceptional and I have no issue stating this is probably (in fact definitely) the best tapas place we've come across so far in London. The sangria was delicious, the patatas bravas perfect, the sea bass was succulent and crunchy, the croquettes melted in your mouth and OH MY GOD - the foie gras Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with brioche was SUBLIME!!!!Maybe I went on a good day, but I was really pleasantly surprised by this little find in the picturesque St Katherine's Dock. The decor was a trendy shabby chique and they have these interesting pincers to eat your tapas (although feel free to ask for regular cutlery if this seems too daunting). I just loved it all! This'll definitely be on my top places to eat in London.Shame there's only one in town! Would they maybe consider opening one in King's Cross just for my eating pleasure? Pretty please????",

    "text": "Wow. Just. Freaking. Wow!Maybe it's the time of year, maybe it's the location. But I've been here for about 3 hours now eating some excellent food.We started out indoors but they were able to find some space outside fairly soon. They happily moved us and all of our stuff to a bench overlooking the boats. The wait staff seemed happy giving recommendations, and while they didn't seem drunk or fat enough to be that familiar with the menu, they were spot on. The food was spectacular. We tried about 8 plates and the only fault I could find is that we could have maybe use a knife to cut the belly pork into smaller morsels. Smaller delicious succulent piggy morsels. Mmmmm. Sorry, back on track...While everything was great, a few things stood out. \u00a0First, the tempura prawns. I always order prawns because my wife doesn't eat them. So while much or my order will be poached, I know I have one safe space. And thank heavens I did, because these were out of this world. Instead of a dry battered prawn with a dipping sauce, these were very lightly battered and coated in a citrus sauce. They were amazing. The Catalunya fois gras was the second surprise. Picture a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with the blowtorched top, but instead it's fois gras underneat, and topped with berries and seeds. I may have been a bit selfish with this dish.Finally, the white chocolate and strawberry dessert. I had a picture in my mind of a mousse type thing, but like everything else here, I was wrong. What arrived was some strawberry bits swimming in cava, with an almost liquid white chocolate island in the middle. I'm grateful that my wife thieved some of my food earlier, as that gave me licence to have maybe a little more than I'd originally planned to sample from her plate. Honestly, I can't find a single negative about this place, and a world of positives. Go there. Now. It's a true London gem.",

    "text": "A really lovely find in St. Katharine's Docks. I came by with a friend at 8 PM on a Friday night and although the restaurant was crammed, they were able to squeeze us in. The restaurant's decor is really gorgeous with low ceilings, tapered candles, and reclaimed wood walls. It is a very intimate dining experience, making it a great place to come on a date or with one or two friends. We ordered the following:--Salmon - this comes beautifully presented with thin slices of salmon wrapped around a dill sauce and covered in a radish- like a very fresh little sushi roll!--Spinach croquetas - it is hard to go wrong with croquettes and these did not disappoint- they were creamy and fresh on the inside, and crispy on the outside--Cheese plate - a delicious assortment of cheese and fruit, again you can't go wrong!--Brava Potatoes - so simple and yet so delicious, the crispy potatoes came with a huge bowl of dipping sauce that was quite tasty--Crispy shrimp - we had not originally ordered these but after eying the tables on both sides of us devouring theirs, we had to try them, and they were fantastic--Foie Gras - this was our only miss of the evening- it did not come with enough bread and the foie gras itself was covered in a caramelized topping that made the dish too sweetThe price point is fair for the quality of the dishes and the fantastic location right on the marina. They even have a few outdoor tables for those elusive London fair weather days!",

    "text": "This place is FAB!!!Tucked away down at St Katherine's dock, with a stripped back interior that has a comfortable, relaxed feel, this place is trendy and informal. The wine choice is extensive with plenty being served by the glass. The Sherry choice is restricted but still with enough variety. The food choices are ample. Served on small slates, in white porcelain bowls and in jars, it is well presented. The Spanish pickles are a jar full of bumper size olives, garlic, caper berries and a chilli. They aren't hot or sour but provide a burst of flavour in your mouth. The patatas bravas is beautifully smokey and sour and the octopus was exquisite. Keep space for pudding. The macerated strawberries are a treat to the eyes and the taste buds. I won't spoil the surprise. Small servings of well made food, good atmosphere and great service",

    "text": "Here with work mates last month. Wine is really below par and overpriced. Tried 1 white and 3 reds around the table at different price points, all cloying on the palate. They're going for innovative, almost gastronomic tapas, but without the foams & sous vide - just the tiny portions and smear of pur\u00e9e. The food is tasty & seasoned well, but the addition of tweezers for your tapas is too much faff. Especially when it's still just paella or deep fried pork belly. They had a good idea, just didn't follow through properly. If you're going for high end tapas, you can't be serving sloppy or basic staples of the tapas world.The interior is designed well, rustic minimalist with a good bar to sit at & observe the tables and people arriving. You're not here for the architecture though, so if you're a foodie looking for a good deal and/or experience, I'd give this place a miss. Jose tapas bar in Bermonsey is much superior and comes in a bit better value.",

    "text": "Bravas Tapas is probably the best Tapas food I've ever had! Every dish ordered has presentation, portion, and tasty flavor!i started with the anchovies served on a crispy bread with a thin layer of Red pepper and tender anchovies that you put on the bread yourself that is the perfect saltiness for any taste buds! Then I had the crispy game hen legs with a special sauce that made the game hen melt in your mouth! Then there was the Chilean Sea Bass that was chunky and tender flaky that melted nicely with every bite and it never seemed to end! Then the Tenderest short ribs that reminded me of a tender chuck roast with special seasoning and carmelization that was just the right temperature to dig into right away! Served with 4 crispy onion rings, it was amazing. Then I had the crispy shrimps on a stick with a flavorful mayo based sauce that I had to make sure we on every bite! What a tantalizing feeling when I Savored every bite of every dish ordered. Although you can have your choice of beverage to wash it down: I had the San Miguel that was just the right drink to compliment the very satisfying meal. The restaurant was packed, but each course came out in great time. Service was excellent and I was checked on every few minutes to make sure I was okay. Only advice is don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach! Portions are bigger than the average Tapas plate. You will get full fast, so pace yourself. Enjoy!",

The ONE thing I didn't enjoy was the pork belly (the crust on it was too dry and overly salty to me), but my husband loved it - so take it in stride. The lamb was to die for. Go, and enjoy.",

I selected Bravas Tapas as it was near London tower and we could sightsee in the Uber on the way too.We were running a little late( 15 minutes) so I had called to let them now which they were glad and make sure we still had our table. \u00a0 The ambience is very casual and quaint. \u00a0 There were many people in the restaurant on a Sunday night so that was a good sign.I went with my wife, her mother and my two children so the five of us had a nice booth near the back. \u00a0The only real area for improvement was our service at first. \u00a0It seemed it took long for them to recognize we were sitting and asking if we wanted something to drink. \u00a0I didn't really mind as we were on vacation and not in a rush, and that we were late to begin with.The food choices are outstanding but not overwhelming and even my kids who are 4 and 12 found things that they would like to eat. \u00a0 \u00a0My mother who is vegetarian had many choices, as wellI'm not going to go into exactly what we had as you should go in for yourself. \u00a0 I've been to at least 30 countries in my life so I had many opportunities to Enjoy different cuisines. \u00a0 This was an outstanding experience.Cheers!Len F",

    "text": "I've been to Bravas Tapas a couple of times now, as it's located around the corner from my office. It's a little tucked away in St Katherine's Dock, but if you know where the Medieval Banquet is (with the plate armour suit outside), then Bravas is just a couple of shop units down.I've been here when it's been mostly empty and packed out, and got a rather different service both times.The first time was with my team at work, and we took a long table with a party of 12 people. Sharing the tapas between us, every dish was beautifully presented and tasted as good as it looked. I'm a big fan of the lamb cutlets - definitely go for those!There is also seating outside, though it always looks rather out of place to me, as it's detached from the restaurant by a public walkway. I'd recommend sitting inside if you visit here.On the occasion me and a couple of colleagues went when it was very busy, service was very slow and we had to chase up our food and the bill. Our waiter apologised when we were paying up, describing it as a \"very good problem to have lots of customers\", but I hope they become better at staffing up at peak times.Go for the food - it's good tapas. Then have a walk around the dock and head to the riverside by Tower Hill. Good way to round out a date.",

    "text": "Bravas is a new intimate tapas bar, perfect if sharing dishes between two in St Katherine Docks.Service is great and the staff are very helpful in helping describe dishes. There were a few that were confusing orders and not giving the correct items to people. One couple were there almost half as long as we were, but because their food was being given to the wrong couple on the same half of a table in the centre of the restaurant, they didn't get any food that whole time! The manager was clearly angry at this. But teething troubles during a soft launch is nothing new. It's one of the risks.Ourselves, we had a great time. The food was good portion and flavour wise. Some dishes such as the seabass were meh, but the raw Cod \"Esqueixada\" was amazing, as was the salmon dish, bravas potatoes and pork sliders. Sometimes simple really is best! The desserts. Well wow. I have never had anything like the Fresh Macerated Strawberries with white choc and cava. Mindblowing. And the crazy lopsided glasses they served a few courses in were quite unique and I want some.In all, lovely place. Great tapas, perfect potions for 2 and nice atmosphere. Dishes a little on the pricier side quantity wise, but this is tapas in London and the quality sure makes up for it. Expect \u00a34-8 per dish. The place has wifi apparently but the staff member we asked didn't know the password and we were about to leave.",

Instead, I ordered a fruity cooler drink [nonalcoholic].

Comes with three stuffed with spinach. Very unique and delicious flavor!Prime Rib with onion rings - I would pass on this dish. Meat was soft and juicy but flavorless. Sliders - These were good!Cheese board - didn't love the fig and berries that come with the board, but cheeses and jam were good. They really don't explain the cheeses. Just dropped the board at our tackle and left. Even when we asked what was what, the waiter said he didn't know.Restaurant also charges an automatic 12.5% gratuity which we noticed many of them do in London.",

Star of the show was the short ribs. Anchovies were nice. Only issues were bread could have been better and the salmon dish was a bit overwhelmed by the aioli and was quite salty. Service a touch slow and they asked me to move my seat mid meal which threw off the rhythm of dinner. Finally for an eating utensil they give you a giant pair of tweezers. \u00a0Pretty cool.",

    "text": "Really charming place for a dinner date if you're in a tapas-y mood! The mister and I like to be epicurious so gravitated towards it as one of the less familiar chains in St Katz Docks, and although pretty busy already, they managed to find us a cosy table for two.The glass of sangria that speedily arrived was exaaactly what I wanted after a long day at the office. We ordered about 6 plates between us, split between the helpful categories of meat, fish, veg, etc. I'm a bit of a cheese fiend so the cheese platter was one of my faves, and we also enjoyed a tasty salmon special, the pan con tomate (a tapas staple for me), and a slow-cooked beef dish that was so tender it fell apart on your fork. Not that they give you a fork actually - everyone gets a pair of what are essentially giant tweezers! My guy thought it was unnecessary (which it totally was) but hey I love a bit of quirky cutlery. The pincer action added an extra level of fun to the meal, especially when you're both going for that last sliver of manchego ;) The service feels warm and authentic, and they took really good care of us throughout so I'm sure we'll be back again. It's not cheap but not crazy for the quality - I think we came out at c\u00a330 a head and were nicely stuffed. The layout is quite intimate (so much so that the mister got amusingly hemmed in by other tables when it was time to leave ha), so I'd suggest taking someone you want to get cosy with!",

I've tried a couple of their signature dishes and was pleasantly surprised, with extra points to the unique salmon rolls (crunchy filling on truffle spice), spicy yellowtail sashimi (which was a special), as well as the standard dishes (potato's, fried spinach balls, and fresh anchovies). The cocktail I took (Gin & Tonic on olive) was very generous in size.Atmosphere seems to be anything between business and romantic, worth a visit.",

I will forget some of the things we had but here goes. Pickles, octopus, croquette, lamb chops, patatas bravas x 2, anchovies, quail, beef carpaccio and a delicious raw fish dish that I don't remember the name. Everything was awesome. Service was great and wines delicious. My usual top score of four but they do deserve 4+",

I really enjoyed the spinach croquettes and wrapped prawns, both were amazing. Also the salmon rolls are MUST MUST MUST have!! This place has a family sort of feel to it and their drinks are great too! The bartender sure knows how to make some great cocktails, thats for sure! Highly recommended to out of towners and the local Londoners as well. I'll be sure to visit again real soon when I'm back in the UK.",

I was really looking forward to eating at Bravas Tapas and especially after reading some good reviews on the place but unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype. Firstly, it's expensive. Secondly, the service was very slow. Lastly, I left still feeling hungry. I know tapas comes up in small portions, obviously, but waiting ages in between receiving each dish we'd ordered for just a mouthful of food is ridiculous. The food was nice, I don't have any complaints about the taste of the food or how it was presented but it just took far too long to be presented to us. I will not be coming here again, was completely disappointed with it.",

As we were shown to our table, \u00a0a drinks order was taken quickly soon after we settled and hello delicious Sangria!As for food, there were a number of dishes in each category - meat, sea food, vegetarian and each sounded quite nice in it's own right. We ordered Gazpacho, \u00a0grilled sea bass and the grilled octopus as we were in a mood for a light dinner. The food was so delicious that I even enjoyed the octopus, \u00a0something i don't usually like...All in all, the food was amazing, served beautifully and came quickly; the service was great and the staff were really nice.
