    "text": "The Bonnington Cafe, on a dark side street in Vauxhall, is one of my favourite places in London - so much so that I have held my birthday party there for the past two years.Lit by fairy lights with higgledy-piggledy d\u00e9cor, the caf\u00e9/restaurant is all that's left of what was once a thriving squatters community. It retains a hippy home-spun feel reflected in the way its run by a collective of chefs who take turns, or audition in others, to cook each evening. As such, the quality varies from night to night but it's always strictly vegan or vegetarian, and there are two options for each course. Rich chocolate tart to rival a French patisserie, admirably experimental but cardboard-like mung-bean pancakes, and a deliciously complex veggie chilli are some of the assorted offerings I've tried. Despite some disappointments, the fairy light bohemian atmosphere always wins me back, and at \u00a310 for three courses or \u00a36.50 for a main and \u00a32.50 for a starter/dessert, it's hard to complain. In addition it has that covetable trait of being BYO with no corkage fee. The Bonnington takes you away from London for the evening. It's intimate, friendly and welcoming to all.",

Starting life as a communal-run enterprise it has since developed into a homely, laid-back venue where you can bring your own booze and eat healthy food. There's loads of events on - I tried a tango class here a while back which was pretty haphazard but fun. A hippy vibe, the place gets let down by the food a bit - it's really hit and miss. The vegan night is the most popular and prices are rediculously cheap. The opening hours are erratic and make sure you book ahead.",

    "text": "This place is a fantastic little find - The Bonnington Caf\u00e9 is a co-operatively run vegetarian & vegan restaurant in the Bonnington Square Community Centre in Vauxhall. This is certainly a best-kept secret for many (so much so, I wasn't sure I'd find a review on here, but that's Qype for ya - it's got a wide reach!!) Bonnington's as it's affectionately known by locals, is tucked away amidst the beautiful community gardens of the square. The Caf\u00e9 has been open since the early 80's when it was started as a squat Caf\u00e9 to provide a good cheap meal for the local community (and maintaining those credentials to help feed those of us who work locally and who are on a budget!). No single person runs the Caf\u00e9 and they don't have one single chef. Bonnington's is maintained by an active collective of member cooks who also contribute to the overall running of the venue. Whoever is taking the helm that particular day provide excellent vegetarian home-cooking at great prices in a laid back and friendly bohemian atmosphere. The chairs and tables are all shapes and sizes, but all very comfortable! The window seat is my fave place for group lunches and is given extra character (and comfort!) with lots of colourful scatter cushions which add a really warm, homely feel. The menu is different every day (I've only been for luncheons, but the same applies in the evening and with no alcohol license it's BYO only) Each cook brings their own style, character and background to the Caf\u00e9's veggie fare and on anyday you can be served anything from Mexican to Traditional British fare. Go along to Bonningtons with an open mind and expect food from anywhere in the world and you won't be disappointed! My experience was that you choose from a communal chalk board which has a couple of choices of starters and mains and one dessert. Great for someone whose normally overwhelmed by the choice on a restaurant's menu! If you're interested in cooking at the Caf\u00e9, the cafe users group meetings are held on the 1st of every month at 6pm and anyone who'd like to have a go at running their own restaurant for a day/evening are very welcome!",

As it was warm we sat outside in the small outside garden. There is a fee to bring your own booze, and whilst the service was not super fast we totally soaked up the joie de vivre which so characterizes this Vauxhall gem.

Nonetheless, it was a filling meal for not much money - and a cheap corkage always goes down well.I feel a review of the venue is going to be as useful as it gets (because the food will always be different - check the website ahead of time). It's been doing everything that seems to be 'in' nowadays, such as mis-matched crockery and furniture along with bare or stripped back wood. There is a large space, with room for walk-ups, but you can get a table mid-week with pretty much only a few hours' notice. A very nice, unpretentious place, next to a gorgeous community garden. One for a light summer's evening, to be sure.",

I have been wanting to go for months, but probably wouldn't even have found it on my own.I love everything about Bonnington's: it's a community project, it's unpretentious, you bring your own, and it exclusively serves vegetarian food.I just wish there were more places like this!Mind you, as a \"tourist\" to the area I am probably as guilty as the large birthday parties of destroying part of the cafe's appeal.We went on Friday night. We were nice and early and got a brief chance to soak up some of the unique homely atmosphere. Come 8 o'clock we were surrounded by several large parties, increasing the decipel levels (as a result we were unable to hear the accordeon player whose tunes would have set the perfect backdrop for a relaxed night) and creating a general feeling of unrest with people arriving late, popping out for a smoke, etc. Not sure how the small staff of one chef with a couple of helpers managed to juggle those crowds and not to run out of food.I feel stressed cooking Sunday lunch for six - this was a dinner party for more than 50 people!The menu was limited to two starters, two mains and two deserts. All delicious, albeit of the old-school vegetarian cuisine of overly nutritious and filling food (beans and nuts galore) - perfectly suited to the surroundings, actually.It is easy to imagine this to have been a squat or massive house share - I particularly appreciated the Chinese whisper which resulted in a spare role of toilet paper to be delivered to the mixed queue.",

However, as soon as I walked in, the smell was inviting and really home cooked, it was like walking round to a friend's house. As the previous reviewer has said, it's very pot luck with a different menu each day and all the tables and chairs are mis matched, which to me, just added to the homely feel and part of it's charm. We had a lovely lunch of warming lentil soup and a delicious Thai curry with brown rice, potato salad and some baby leaf green salad. I was pretty full at the end but we managed to share some apple crumble between us. If you're around the Vauxhall area and like veggie food it's well worth making a trip over there for and on the day I went the food was easily comparable to (more famous & more expensive) The Gate veggie restaurant in Hammersmith (apparently one of Gwyneth Paltrow's favourite places to eat.",

We then were served the main which had all the qualities of the good vegetarian meal but somehow it didn't all add up, fine but nothing to write home about. The cafe is a mix between the quirkily endearing and the inept. Your name is put on the table which is a nice touch, however it was a shame that no one came to welcome us in at the door which left as standing awkwardly among other diners for a good 5 minutes. I can appreciate that this restaurant is not a professional establishment but rather a collective of young chefs attempting to make their name which I really do respect but realistically it wasn't brilliant. I would probably come here another day when a different chef is running the kitchen but for the moment I will give it a miss.",

Check out bonningtonsquaregarden.o\u2026 and vivavauxhall.org for a brief intro to the area.The restaurant itself is one of the buildings which was squatted and was then turned into a communal vegetarian cafe. \u00a0It operates on a rotating cook system which lends a unique sense of surprise to it. \u00a0The food is first of all cheap (roughly 10 quid for three courses, BYO and non alcoholic drinks are cheap), wholesome (vegetarian or vegan) and eco (if possible from surrounding areas and carbon offset etc.). \u00a0Given the rotating cook system you can have a different experience each night. \u00a0The food is generally very good (but it has to be judged in the context; local restaurant and very very cheap) and the atmosphere is unique and bohemian chilled. \u00a0A great experience.",

It is run by a collective of chefs and you can a user group meeting (held every 1st of the month) if you want to have a go. The vibe is bohemian with a warm and community feel. The candle lit tables and fairy lights add a lovely touch and I felt instantly comfortable. On top of this it's incredible value food with a 3 course meal for \u00a310, and you can also bring your own bottle without corkage charge.It's important to book a place before you go, and also check out which chefs are cooking when, as their meals and cooking styles vary hugely. You can also see what else is on as they often hold special events or music nights. When I went I had chick peas, root vegetables and saffron stew on cous cous followed by white chocolate, orange and saffron fondant (this lady loved her saffron). The food was wholesome and scrummy and instantly I was persuaded to return.I've heard from others that the food hasn't been so great when they've been (which is why it's a good idea to see if the menu is your thing on the night you want to go) \u00a0but unless you can't handle a meal without a bit of meat, I recommend this place vegetarian or not.",

I love the cafe atmosphere and how the menu is never the same. The chef is always different as there is a waiting list for people wanting to cook for this restaurant. On top of all that? It's BYOB! The odd thing about our eating experience was that none of our friends were vegetarian. We simply saw how quaint the cafe was and booked a table. I loved the simplicity of the menu: 2 starters, 2 mains and 2 desserts to choose from (if you want all 3 courses). Surprisingly, everything was really tasty! I had the wheatball and mashed potato main, a apple doughnut for dessert and all the wine I we could carry over from the Sainsbury by the station. I cannot find one thing wrong with this place. I would highly suggest people to try it out - even if you're not a vegan / vegetarian. It's still a great experience.",

    "text": "It's odd that, having been a veggie for 20 odd years, it has taken me so long to try out the Bonnington Cafe. It's on the edge of Bonnington Square - a small, very leafy, hidden enclave which feels a world apart from from the Vauxhall gyratory, just a stone's throw away. The Cafe feels equally tucked away, and has the chic \"lived in\" feel you'd expect of a co-operatively run vegetarian/vegan joint. It's cosy, certainly, though when it is full - which is most evenings of the week (booking essential) - it can feel rather crowded, as the tables are quite close together. The client\u00e8le are as mixed as you might expect: suited office workers on the way home, cheek-by-jowl with New Agers in tapestry hoodies, and everything in between.The Cafe features a different chef each night, so the food is going to vary. It's all fresh and either veggie or vegan: there are always two starters, two mains and two puddings to choose from, chalked up on a blackboard. It BYO as far as alcohol is concerned. \u00a0Prices are cheap - starters and puddings are \u00a33 and mains \u00a38. On the night I was there it was certainly inventive and tasty, and very good value for central London, although to be honest it is not the best vegetarian I've had. Cold celeriac spaghetti was an interesting twist (and certainly tasted much better than it sounds), though a black-bean chipotle burger with fried potatoes and salad felt a little ordinary. Pudding was a fulsome portion of apple crumble and custard. I certainly didn't go hungry. Despite being packed out, service was surprisingly efficient and friendly. We had a 6:30-9:00 booking slot, so lingering wasn't an option, but the old wooden school chairs don't really lend themselves to that anyway.Booking is as quirky as the cafe itself. You find out the name of the person on duty that day by looking at the web-site, and either e-mail them or phone them on their own e-mails/numbers personally. Don't e-mail on the day as there is no internet access at the cafe.",

    "text": "Bonnington Cafe has a lovely relaxed vibe, like dining in someones living room. The cafe is downstairs in a house, slap bang in the middle of a residential Vauxhall street. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the cafe came about in the 80s as a communal kitchen for local squatters without cooking facilities. Regardless, it's lovely that a taste of London's dying bohemian spirit is still alive and kicking in Zone 1. Even lovelier is that upstairs to the cafe there is an arts hub. The last time we visited there were auditions happening for a musical. Song rang through the house as they searched for their stars. The food varies night by night. Different folks cook on different nights. Check the website to find out who is on. Expect home cooked fare - simple, hearty, healthy and vegetarian. It's not complicated restaurant food - but good. Also don't forget to book ahead too - it gets busy.Last time we were lucky, and early enough to sit outside in their garden on a warm summer night. It felt intimate and friendly. Basically a special relaxed night that could only happen at a hippy bohemian commune cafe in London.",

On that particular evening it was a vegan menu. I love many a vegan dish, but not an entire menu. So the other night, when my friend suggested meeting here, my heart sank a bit. Happily, as it turns out, the food couldn't have been better this time.Cheesy, warming veggie lasagne, tick. Slice of peanut butter tart for dessert, double tick. Both utterly delicious, and while the portions were by no means large, they were more than adequate. The atmosphere is friendly, low-key and homely. Superb prices and BYOB. Give this place a whirl, it's a refreshing little gem in the heart of Vauxhall. And hopefully you'll strike gold with the menu, my fingers are crossed for you.",

I'd heard rave reviews from friends, and the fact that it was an independent, vegetarian restaurant (of which I think there is a definite shortage in London) meant I was already favourably predisposed.As has already been pointed out on here, there is a different chef on duty everyday which makes it a) hard to review and b) a very hit and miss/pot luck affair. I went for the warming coconut Indian soup, which I was very disappointed to find was essentially hot broth with a bag of frozen sweetcorn and peas tipped into it. Not being a fan of sweetcorn, and given that it was the main ingredient, I think some reference to it on the dish name would have been good!That said, the decor is very nice, great lighting, a cosy atmosphere so I guess I'll just try my luck another day.",

This is not indicative of any other day's cooking, and so it's up to you all to visit and find out which days are good or not for yourselves!I popped along here for lunch with a veggie friend - I'd been once before yonks ago, before my Yelping days - on the second Tuesday of the month (in case you want to cross-reference cooks!). On the menu was a Moroccan tagine and a bean burger, which were both absolutely delicious, and at \u00a35.50 a dish, it was an absolute steal. Pudding was a pear crumble, which was not great - it was essentially cooked pieces of pear with some sugary crumble dashed on top, and there was barely any custard. Also, my water glass was chipped around the rim, which I was not impressed with, but the staff were lovely, the food was quick, and the prices were very, very reasonable indeed.Overall, if you're looking for good veggie home-cooking, this is somewhere you'll love. It's a cosy, slightly quirky little place that screams community project in a good way. Not somewhere you'd go for a classy slap-up meal, but for a lunchtime pop-in joint, a lovely place to have a meal and a conversation, even if the food isn't going to be consistently restaurant standard.P.S. It's apparently BYO! I'm definitely coming back for dinner to test that one out!",

I don't believe that is always the case however I lucked out this time. I started with Muhammara Dip which was quite flavorful and a nice nutty start. It came with 2 slices of room temp Rye bread... the dish might do better with crostini or crudite instead. It needed a little crunch but again, very flavorful. I definitely cleaned my plate.For the main, I had a quiche with leeks, sweet potatoes and spinach served with 2 different salads on the side. As a vegan, I get nervous when you say \"quiche\" without the word tofu in front of it. There was no tofu in sight and I haven't gotten sick so I'm trusting that the chef just created some magic in the kitchen because it was really nice. Super hearty. Exactly what I needed.Then came dessert. Neither of the choices REALLY jumped out at me but I opted for a cashew-based blueberry lemon pie thingy which was raw, served with ice cream. I was surprised by the coloring of the pie. It was a muddy brown color- not bad or anything, just unexpected. It was very tasty and the ice cream was a perfect compliment to mellow out how sweet the pie was.*IMPORTANT NOTE: THEY ARE CASH ONLY. PLAN AHEAD*All in all, the food was great. I'm proud to support a co-op owned establishment and look forward more places like this popping up. GO, Bonnington Cafe, GO!",
