I LOVED the condiments on the table, I wanted to drink the gochujang one. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "Two days, two fantastic Asian meals. OTB has been open for a while now and is getting pretty busy - had to queue to get in on a Sunday night. I've been a little bit wary to this point as it seems to be pretty trendy from the outside, but make no mistake - this place is totally badass and, trendy as it may be, the place has a Korean matriarch who seems to oversee things. Us being us, we went a bit nuts, getting a bunch of things from the 'Small dishes' section (jap-chae, toppoki, Korean arancini), a 'small' dish of Korean fried chicken, and two spicy pork buns. I also had a honey yuzu tea which, like Cocoro's, is utterly delicious. The small dishes are pretty small, served in small metal canteens or enamel dishes. The toppoki (rice noodle cylinders with kimchi, fish sausage, and chilli sauce) was definitely the star here, definitely the best I've had in London. The other two dishes were good - the japchae was solid with nice crunchy veg. The fried chicken is really good and served with a nice heap of coleslaw - don't let the 'Small' label trick you, you get a decent whack of chicken for your \u00a311.50. The sauce is excellent too (trumping Jubo in that regard I think), getting the balance right between sweet, hot, and sour. Then the buns. I have to give it to them, OTB make one of the best buns I've had to date (protip, the sauce is back loaded so it gets progressively tastier as you eat through). They're really generously stuffed with delicious pork, and even though I was dangerously full at this point, I couldn't help but stuff my fat face full of the drippy goodness. Awesome. All in all, I had an awesome experience. Trendy maybe, but there is authenticity leaking through the cracks. On top of that, the staff are really really nice. I was absolutely stuffed (around ~\u00a318 a head) and will definitely be back soon. I'm sorry I ever doubted and judged you prematurely, OTB, you truly are the babbiest.",

I ordered the bulgogi beef on a roll, and I was pleasantly surprised with the vegetables that came with. The flavors mixed together in my mouth to create a taste that anyone could enjoy when I took my last bite I was left wanting more so I ordered the chicken dumplings, they came out steaming and when I dipped it in the dumpling sauce and I felt like I was in paradise. The fried dough combined with the tender chicken and crunchy flavors created a sensation like no other. The only problem was the E in the merry Christmas sign had fallen.

There were so many items to choose from. I chose something light. I don't remember the name, but after checking my photos that I posted on the day, I recollected it. I had OnTheBun with spicy chicken filling. It was amazing. But it was too small. It got over really quick. I also had plum tea. Sweet, warm, fruity tea, served in a steel mugMy friend on the other hand had Kimchi fried rice and seafood pan-cackes. I did taste them, and it was really filing. Great quantity for the price. I had to get another one, and I went for it. Had another set of OnTheBun with spicy chicken. I'll visit this place again. On other note, the waitresses are pretty and the Chef is amazing.",

    "text": "First time in korean restaurant. Pleasant interior, nice atmosphere and very fast service, probably too fast. My friends ordered straight away, but I have asked the waitress to wait for my choice. Unfortunately the food arrived in 2 minutes before she took the order from me. English level of the staff is really poor so I wouldn't count on their advise. 2 dishes arrived cold including beef buns and beef bibimbab. When we have asked about it, they told us 'yes it's cold' - why isn't it written in the menu? Not everyone is from Korea! Kimchi Bokeum Bab - kimchi bacon paella was quite tasty, though I can't say it about beef bibimbab. No dessert menu which is not acceptable for dessert lover like me. The prices are ok, the service charge is included which is funny to add when the staff isn't communicative at all. Too many restaurants to discover in London to choose this one again.",

    "text": "Tiny little Korean street food restaurant near old street. Lovely staff. Amazing buns. We shared all sorts of things and they were all pretty good. A little expensive but they pretty much had one staff member on per two/three tables. Wine list is super pricey and I would like to see some local beers. Whatever you do (unless you are vegetarian) order the pork buns. They are so flipping good. They come out in servings of two but you can order one extra if you are a three. The dumplings are tasty too but very small serving size. The kimchi is a good mild 'beginners' kimchi to start people on. Fried chicken looked nice and I loved the tofu with toasted seaweed but the others weren't so sold. Kimchi pancake also delicious. Rice with veg was a bit yawn so would skip that next time.There is often a line at this place but it moves super quick. Food comes out fast and aesthetically this place rocks. Lots of beautiful design to take in without trying too hard. So I will be back.",

The toppoki is amazing, I have no idea what it's made of but it's a bit like gnocchi in a sticky sweet vegetable sauce (and that does not so it justice). The soups are great, my only criticism is the noodles could be better - they're a little bit too supermarkety and that lets the dish down. The fun thing is we had no idea what anything meant on the menu so just had to go for it - and we were not disappointed. At all.",

I wasnt disappointed and 45 mins later I was feeling sufficiently much warmer :) The menu overall looked good and there were a few things I recognised from other Korean restaurants as well as some other stuff that I hadnt heard of, that I would now like to try out. Like the baps.I shall return to sample the baps!",

    "text": "When my friend and I walked in and were able to get seated within five minutes on a busy Saturday night (at the window table!), I felt like I had won the lottery. When we tasted the food, I felt like I had gone to heaven.Here's the blow-by-blow:- Honey Yuzu tea: comes in a metal mug with a lid, and a cute wooden spoon. Sweet and tasty, with a light citrus kick coming from a healthy portion of yuzu at the bottom.- Kimchi mandu (dumplings): SO GOOD. Fried to perfection. I could eat three orders of this and be happy.- Kimchi jeon (pancakes): wonderfully crisp with a tender bite. Definitely more interesting if you eat it with the fresh scallion garnish.- Kimchi side: flavorful, not too spicy, could have used more of it!- Beef bulgolgi bibimbap (stuff on rice): excellent lean cuts of beef, well-marinated with a good texture. We were too full to eat all of the rice, but I polished off the deliciously crunchy pickled vegetables.- Japchae (glass noodles): perhaps the weakest link on a powerhouse roster of items, but still tasty. I would recommend reallocating the 4.90 toward other dishes. Like more mandu.- Spicy chicken bun: I wasn't expecting a bao-style sandwich, but boy, was I pleased with it! The two buns were huge, with a big bun-to-filling ratio (great for carb-loving me, a little much for my friend but she finished it in the end), and it was definitely the best value out of the items we tried.- When the bill came out to be just under \u00a320 each, I was thrilled.Downsides:- It's not a place for lingering, as you would want other diners waiting for your table to experience OTB's delights ASAP.- Additionally, they ask you to wait outside the restaurant before you get your table. We were fine, but I'll bet it's not that charming if it's pouring or freezing.I hope I'm as lucky and get seated equally quickly next time I come, but this is food worth waiting for.",

I don't recommend showing up at conventional eating times; we always aim for something like 6:30pm on a weeknight in order to secure a table quickly, and even then we sometimes have to wait. (They don't take reservations.) Easier to get a table on the weekends, as its proximity to Shoreditch/the City means that its a popular post-work option for professionals in the area.There are a few fusion items on the menu, including the kimchi paella and kimchi arancina starter (fried Italian rice balls stuffed with kimchi and cheese). Also a fan of the soy/garlic fried chicken and, of course, the bi bim bab. Prices are very reasonable and the staff are always friendly.",

I wouldn't be the biggest expert on Korean food but I do know what I like and I found the dish very tasty. A generous serving of your typical mushy but nice rice and thin strips of beef with a salad garnish and dressing on top.I was concerned the takeaway portion may have been a bit measly but it was anything but. Service was relatively quick but difficult to comment on what table service is like. Not overly expensive and as its old street you can simply grab and go then pick up a few beers in the newsagents next door and make your way to a suitable place to sit and people watch. Would definitely return, this time for a sit down.",

I also got a soup noodle bowl with vegetable fritters and a egg . The broth was so flavourful and the fritter and egg and noodles all went so well together ! Really enjoyed it ! I was so full by the end ! Like really should have gotten two small dishes OR the soup bowl... (Instead of the one small and soup bowl I got!) . I ordered a beer \u00a0too that I mistakenly thought was a Korean beer, but it was a Belgium or something haha . For so reason Korean food is like Mexican it just takes better with a beer! Must have something to do with the spices ! Delicious place, hoping to make it back again this week!",

Heck, they don't even take names when you get there, so be ready to be very English and do what they do best, and queue.When japchae is on the menu, I always get it. OTB has it as a starter portion and it's great size to share. Other great starters? Saeng Dubu: Fresh tofu - it was so fresh it almost melted in my mouth.For my main dish, I ordered the bulgogi beef on the noodle, it wasn't bad, just wish there was a bit more meat in it though.Service was great despite how busy it was, they were very friendly and courteous, even if they have missed putting in an item we ordered. We weren't charged so weren't all that fussed.They might try to serve a table that seats four to those in parties of three or four first even if you're in the front of the queue with just you and a mate, so if you don't mind sitting with some randoms, do speak up and tell them seat you with another party of two.Overall, I like this place, it's relatively in my area, not too pricy, good food & good service. Will visit again in the future.",

The place is pretty small inside with limited seating and has clearly been formulated from the book on how to do hipster restaurants: 'street' food, beat up white enamel dishes and metal dishes, almost illegible menu written in tiny brown letters on brown paper, brick / tile walls, whatever. Fortunately overall the food wins out.My favourite is the spicy noodle soup with beef. It's got those curly noodles like the kind you get in packs of instant noodles but works perfectly with the spicy broth and other ingredients. Warming and satisfying comfort food.The korean fried chicken with sweet, spicy sauce is amazing. It comes in different sizes ranging from very small to quite large so take your pick.The noodles with seafood was less successful having scant seafood and gritty mussels, just not as good as it could be.Service was pretty good and food comes quite quickly. Prices are reasonable.",

Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing, but I was also disappointed with the size of the portion. It wasn't what I was after and it was surprisingly expensive for the small buns we received.I'd say definitely try this place out to see what I'm talking about, and to also may be try their sweet buns, but I don't think I'll be going back unfortunately.",

I usually either get the bulgogi beef or pork 'on the bab' (i.e. on a bed of rice, which includes delicious coleslaw with lashings of spicy mayo, bit of kimchi, some pickles, spring onions) or the bibimbab, but I've gotten the spicy chicken before, which is also good. Very very filling and not especially unhealthy - the meat is marinated in a kind of dense, slightly sweet and spicy sauce (I mean dense as in the flavouring penetrates the meat quite intensely, I don't mean that the sauce is sticky or gloopy) and the sticky rice is very comforting to 'discover' at the bottom of your plate. Starters also very good - had the kimchi and arancini balls, very crispy and the dip was great.",

Now, I've been spoiled rotten with amazing Korean restaurants in LA and the OC. Korean food is my favourite cuisine. I love the flavors and all the condiments. Listen, if you really know Korean food, most likely you will not like this place. Just saying. I ordered the Bibimbap without meat. I wish they had a veggie version with mushrooms. Btw, it did not come with kimchee, so I ordered a side of it. The entire dish came cold. The egg on top was chilled. The portion was big for me. I didn't finish it. The Mr ordered a medium portion of wings (12), half soy garlic and half sweet and spicy. He said the soy garlic was better. We also ordered an appetizer. It was a seaweed salad. It was good. The aloe punch was also nice. The staff and service were good. The buns looked yummy. I don't think I'll return.",

    "text": "Finally made it to this place after hearing from friends that it's a 'must try' spot...We managed to get a seat for four around 10:30 (last orders by the way) in which the waitress was keen to tell us. After settling in we ordered the seafood pancake and shrimp dumplings. The starter portions were very small, a little too small for my liking. I think there were only three dumplings. The dumplings were well seasoned, and had good sized chunks of shrimp in them too! I felt the seafood pancake tasted a bit 'doughy'. Almost like it wasn't thoroughly cooked through. Not sure if this is how it's supposed to be, but at the time I wasn't feeling it - I may it try again upon my return... For main we went for a large portion of Soy & Garlic Fried Chicken with crushed peanuts and bowls of rice. The chicken was glistening from it's sticky coated sauce, I couldn't wait to get stuck in! Included in the tray of chicken was coleslaw with some EPIC sauce which the waiter described as Korean Mayonnaise. I wanted to take that sauce home with me, we were all trying to figure out whether it was store bought or homemade. The waiter unfortunately confirmed that it was homemade...boooo! The selection of chicken was perfect - boneless chicken thighs and bone-in wings (winning combo in my eyes). It went beautifully with the plain rice.To drink I went for the So Maek (recommended) which is Soju with Beer. It was served ice cold in a metal canister style bottle, and went perfect with the meal.This was my second time trying Korean cuisine and I can honestly say some of the best fried chicken I've ever tasted! If you're around the area, do yourself a favour and try On The Bab!",

Let me just say that for \u00a38, that is a massive pot of soup... but soooo delicious. The servers and menu make things kind of confusing (i.e., my girlfriend ordered the spicy pork buns and he said, \"do you want two portions?\" which is what is on the menu -- 2 buns -- and she said, \"how do you mean?\" and he said, \"do you want one portion or two?\" and she said \"are you saying I could get individual buns of different flavors?\" and he said, \"if you want two flavor buns, you need to pay full price for an order of two portions, but if you just want one bun, it's \u00a33.90\" -- so that was confusing. Just say yes if he asks if you want two portions.) but it's pretty straightforward otherwise.It's a tight squeeze in there, you'll get cozy with your neighbors when they get your butt in their face as you try to sit down, but hey, that's London, eh?I'll be back -- it's delicious!",

The prices are pretty reasonable and the service was quick too. The only negative is that there's always a wait whether for lunch or dinner. My friend and I came here because we wanted Korean fried chicken. This location only serves the soy ginger and sweet spicy flavors (you can do half-half) but the other locations seem to do more flavors. I prefer the sweet spicy more (although it wasn't spicy at all) and I also really liked their spicy mayo which they drizzle generously on the side cabbage. We also got the Beef Bibimbab which was a delicious classic but I'd like it more if it was served in a stone pot. The Soondubu Jigae was also nice but we only got very few pieces of seafood in our serving.Overall, the food here is pretty solid and decently priced. Other than the long wait, I can't think of another reason why I won't come back!",

    "text": "Pretty good bi bim bap! There is usually a wait, so be prepared. But the service is quick and friendly, and the cute decor and low lighting soften the high level of activity. It's a cute place, with a tiny bar and staircase leading down to the facilities. The pricing is very reasonable, our bill came to just under \u00a330 for two veggie bowls, two teas and a seaweed salad. The salad was tasty, but not fresh. What really made it for me was the plum tea, it was so satisfying for my sweet tooth! I can't give full marks because the star dish was missing a bit of flavour, and we were really crammed in together, causing some discomfort to us and neighbours. But I'd definitely come back on a quieter day, for a quick fix of one of my favourite cuisines ... and looking forward to trying their kimchi, pancakes and the 'new' octopus salad!",

I would come back to this spot for some quick lunch but probably not for dining and chit chatting since this venue is rather small and not the coziest place on earth.",

I love the idea of bringing korean food to the masses through this fast/urban type of venues, but my experience yesterday was \"in a hurry\". It starts with the queue (kind of getting used to that by now) but we were asked to wait outside in the rain..a joke. Our bibimbap was tasty but wasn't very hot so got cold very fast. Buns were good, korean fried chicken was definitely the best...waiter advised to take the big portion but this was just too much for the 2 of us. Horrible teenager music playlist, noisy and in a hurry...will have to come back as this went just too fast to enjoy.",
