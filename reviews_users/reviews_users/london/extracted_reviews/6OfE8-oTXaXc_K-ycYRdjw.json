    "text": "I have mixed feelings about Hache on Curtain Road. It's just not 'quite right' consistently enough for it to warrant more than 3-stars.On my first visit, it was relatively quiet - but the waiter was acting like he was single-handedly silver-serving a wedding party of 200! We were literally pointed at the table and we sat ourselves down.We ordered drinks from another sour-faced waitress and we were brought the wrong ones - which is fair enough, that happens, no harm-no foul - and when I (being British) apologised for her mistake, she rolled her eyes and whipped them away.Very bad start.Things got better with the delivery of our food - it was delicious! I had a burger with peanut butter, and it ticked both my boxes for meat and peanuty goodness! They redeemed the bad service with great food!On other visits the service has better and I even saw the waitress do this thing I've seen called a 'smile', where the corners of her mouth were upturned - it was most pleasant! The food has been consistently good, but just wish they'd brush up on being friendlier.Byron - Better service by miles. Food is of similar quality.Honest Burger - Better service. Best burgers in London.GBK - Dog food.",

    "text": "We had lunch at Hache and I must say I did not expect anything particularly nice but hey, this was BAD!We had a normal cheeseburger and a chicken burger. They ask if you want it on ciabatta or on brioche bun. The cheeseburger comes on a brioche bun which was stale, probably defrosted the day before and dried out. Shame. The point should be the meat, which is a steak and I'm not sure this is the best cut for a burger... In fact, burgers are normally made from the most flavoursome, fattiest cuts of beef. So, even though the point should be the quality of the meat, I think this is lost in the context of a burger.The chicken is the worst bit. Dry, chewy, inedible. I left almost all of it. The ciabatta is not fresh either, soft and no crust, obviously coming from one of those factories which use preservatives to keep their rolls softer for longer. No animal deserves to be killed for THIS.We order chips as a side, which are pale, undercooked, disappointing.Well, overall bad. We have learned our lesson and pass this recommendation to you: don't go there. Go to any place in the area that serves burger at half the prize and disappoints less.",

We were tempted by the hoisin duck and the rosemary lamb, but opted for their more classic offerings.Food: The food was good, but not mind-blowing. My partner had a chorizo steak burger cooked medium, and it came perfectly pink and juicy. He loved it. I had a chicken \"burger\" - the honey moutard - which was okay. The chicken was tender and juicy, but lacking in flavour. And when you've got chicken, bacon, cheese, and a honey mustard sauce, you should have flavour! It was bland and I don't recommend it. My waiter initially brought me the wrong fries, so my sweet potato fries were fresh from the fryer and very hot when they arrived. They were good, but a bit squidgy.Service: good by London standards. Reasonably speedy, not in your face, and not rude. No complaints but nothing to write home about.Ambience: the interior has a real Neverwhere vibe to it. Music is loud, the crowd is a mix of tourists and out of towners. Not a lot of Londoners or hipsters, probably because they know of better burgers with walking distance.It was fine, but it didn't impress. I've had better in walking distance, I just didn't think to book ahead. Lesson learned.",

Their short cocktail menu-- mojitos and many other flavours of mojitos-- along with some wine and beer options, doesn't help much with bringing a better vibe. One other thing-- understaffed. And therefore the food didn't come very promptly. Nothing too special about this place other than paying an excessive amount of money for something that is very profitable for their business.Meh...",

    "text": "I can't understand why this place is always crowded. Yes, probably it's just because it's shoreditch, and even if you open a vending machine it'll be crowded each night, but damn, that burger is nothing special thinking that there is bukowsky and a lot of other better places just a throw from there!Anyway, the place seems really strange: I mean, it's supposed to be classy and chic, and then it has some strange decors, like the writings on the mirrors, strange ornaments on the walls (angel's wings? really?!?)But it's ok, it's shoreditch, whatever. Let's go to the important one, the food:let's start with something easy, appetizers: last time I went here (Yes, I gave this place 3 chances for removing from the 1 star pit) we opted for nachos and chicken wings: nachos were a bit too easy, just nachos with some slices of cheese and sauce on top (I mean I know that this is how nachos are prepared, but would it be possible to have something just a little bit more elaborated!? Not that much, just to make it reasonable to pay 5 quids for some nachos!), while chicken wings were good and hot!Now, for the (usually good) part: the burger! Now, this is a burger I had several issues with: - too cooked: medium rare is medium rare, if the meat is brown it's not only medium-rare but it's neither medium. - every single dish is just too dry, there is no sauce in it, nothing that will remove the dryness from cooked burger and buns (especially with the soft ones) - carrots? Why do I have to receive carrots in my burger?!?!? Yeah I mean check it I'm not joking, inside every burger there are carrots and onion. I mean are you crazy!?!? What the hell?! You end up having completely disjointed flavors with half of the burgers present in the menu.And these are just the burger problems. French fries are over cooked (same thing for the sweet potatoes), onion rings?!? Woah I saw a review actually suggesting those over cooked, over fried, oily greasy pieces, I mean do people still have any taste nowadays!?! Wow, simply wow.Ah really funny last part: SUGGESTED FOR A DATE. Yes, Would you really have a date in damn burger place?!?!?! WHAT!!! So you are planning your wedding at Fish&Chips or a hot dog stand!? Please... When going out to a date, everything is important, and it's better you don't end up with your hands smelling of burger and meat pieces in your teeth.Geez, I think people coming here were just crazy, sorry guys but you are.",

The exposed brick interior with candles on the dark wooden tables and even a set of cream coloured angel wings on the back wall were inviting and romantic. The burger selection is vast, and I settled on the Fajita Chicken Sandwich. The chicken was cooked nicely and I enjoyed the red pepper and grilled onions on it. I left off the cheddar cheese. It was nice, but I'd go for the Chicken Au Naturel or Falafel Sweetcorn next time. Chris chose the Steak Reblochon and woke up the next morning thinking about it. I'd say he liked it. We ordered the beer battered onion rings and the sweet potato frites to share and both were exceptionally nice. The onion rings were the best I've had in England so far and the sweet potato frites were nicely cooked -- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

    "text": "Really good, I had the steak cheeseburger, the potato wedges, the REAL lemonade and an Oreo shake. SO basically I had that very same burger in the US before at Monterey Grill in Port Orange, Florida. And that Oreo Shake is pretty much like one that you would get at Dairy Queen. I\u00b4m just talking about the taste. The Lemonade was excellent, just the way I like it. The potatoe wedges were good, nothing outrageous though. Service was good and attentive, decoration is alright, reminded me of the Umami Burger places in California. Lots of comparisons here but that\u00b4s just fine cause the size of the burger is very decent and the prices are average for London. Really good modern US-American Burger place, meaning the modern places with the unusual Burgers, but in London! Can\u00b4t wait to try one of their freaky Burgers next time.If you\u00b4re from California, think Umami Burgers with bigger Burgers;)",

    "text": "Food? Amazing. Service? Impeccable. What is there not to love about Hach\u00e9? I came here last night for a farewell dinner; one of my good friends was leaving the country. Our server told us that there was a bit of a wait, but kept updating us as to how long until we were seated. Once we were at a table, our server instantly made sure to answer any of our questions. He even mentioned to us what their milkshake of the day was; a concoction he thought of as he walked to work that morning. (It was delicious)I ordered a Canadian, with an extra patty. The meat was tender and cooked to a succulent perfection. Their skin on chips and Hach\u00e9 frites were perfectly fried. Crunchy on the outside and tender on the insude. \u00a0 What can I say? It was excellent. \u00a0In every possible way. The only downside for some may be that there is a nightclub right next door. Late at night on the weekends it can get a little loud, but the crowd last night did not seen to mind and neither did we. Will I come back? Definitely. Hopefully our server manages to get his shake on the menu.",

    "text": "For me, there's no greater comfort food than a thick, juicy burger. When I'm seeking the perfect burger, I have my favorite go-to restaurant: Hach\u00e9 Burgers in Shoreditch. Combining French cuisine with quality burgers, Hach\u00e9's menu offers something for everyone, and it's sure to be flavourful and delicious.The Hach\u00e9 chicken club sandwich was topped with ripe green avocados, which added a cool creaminess and blended perfectly with the saltiness of the cured bacon and aged cheddar. The chicken was juicy and cooked to perfection, and every bite left me wanting more. I paired my chicken club with an order of truffle cheese frites, which did not disappoint. The cheese was melty and delicious, and the hint of truffle flavor wasn't overpowering, but complimentary.My partner ordered the nachos, which were smothered with golden cheddar cheese, topped with spicy jalapenos. The sides of sour cream, salsa, and guacamole added the right amount of kick and coolness to the dish that I couldn't help myself. I had to reach for a chip, and I'm glad I did. I have zero complaints on this one. The baked camembert was to die for, as the chef drizzled honey across the top, which mixed with the heat of the chili to really give your taste buds a surprise. The ciabatta bread was toasty and crispy, and perfect for dishing the camembert into your mouth. Hach\u00e9 is gourmet comfort food. From the moment you walk in, the whole experience is comforting. The staff and service are more than you can ask for, and the restaurant design feels upscale but welcoming. I highly recommend.",

It is not 5 stars because it's the best burger place but it is exactly what you need when you want to consume a lot! The staff here is unfortunately not the friendliest. They're not rude, but not particularly nice either. As for the food, I used to get a normal 'burger' with the choice between a brioche or ciabatta bread for a bun, however, you can also have a naked burger, replacing the bun with a nice salad. In regards to fries - I'm generally not a fan of common fries, but love sweet potato fries - but Hach\u00e9 has these amazing cheesy fries, if you're in love with cheese like I am then that's the way to go! And there's more for cheese lovers: Last time I've tried their delicious fried halloumi sticks, which came with a very tasty dipping sauce. By the end of the meal I was too full for desert - but there desert is quite rich! Which is not bad, but depending on your taste buds and how much you can still consume at the end.",

Hache is definitely a new contender, with an intriguing menu of burgers, some classic (cheddar and bacon) and others on the more adventurous side (served in a smoke filled some anyone?).I opted for the gruyere with truffle aioli and caramelised onion. Delightfully gooey and indulgent, and my medium rare was presented to perfection. The sides left a little to be desired- chips were disappointingly thin and lacking season and were brought to the table lukewarm. The onion rings were massive but slightly greasy. Good atmosphere and friendly service, maybe a bit pricey at around \u00a316 for burger and chips? A solid choice though!",

The burger was tasty enough but I've has tastier (plus all the options were really boring even though there were about 10 different to choose from - I think I went for the Canadian just because I was that uninspired - bacon and cheese FTW...) Good selection of beers though - I enjoyed the Otley ale they had on.

Although I'm not one of those who really craves burgers what I do appreciate is a good burger and my gosh to Hache have them.There theme, I feel, is most definitely gourmet and this is shown through the decadence of the venue itself. The atmosphere is relaxed formal and \u00a0the design of the building itself is very rustic suave. Odd for a burger joint really but the menu suits this with their unusual and original burger options.We started with nachos which were tasty. Standard nachos with all the trimmings and large dollops of them, with plenty of jalape\u00f1os which I liked. It was a great start to our meal. I then opted for the Milano burger with extra bacon. The Milano burger had a Mediterranean twist being served with mozzarella, sun dried tomato sauce, and parmesan. I also had a side of wedges... The fatter the chip, the better!The burgers came quickly and were presented well. I cut mine in half and the burger was cooked to perfection - perfectly medium rare and not over soggy (at first). It was, delicious. Every mouthful I enjoyed and I finished it all! Just a perfect combination of flavours and the bacon gave it that great salty addition - NOM!The wedges were also good, standard really but I love wedges and hadn't had them for ages so I was happy!Overall it was a very pleasant evening - I'm still slightly unsure that the theme of the restaurant matches the burgers but hey, who am I to judge when they serve good food!",

    "text": "Having previously received Time Out's Best Burger in London, the bar is set high for Hache. Having this burger joint on my doorstop in Shoreditch to facilitate my ongoing burger tour, was a touch and it was about time I took full advantage of it.It was my birthday, so I booked a table for some burger fun before our comedy night nearby. There was a good selection of burgers with various variations, all with mostly \"French\" names. The family behind Hache have a love of France, but seeing as burgers is not a very French thing, they appear to embrace their love with French ingredients. That said, there are still some other areas of the world covered on the menu. After receiving a crisp glass of dry white wine and a banana milkshake, we ordered our burgers. My companion had the Steak le Fume with caramalised onions, smoked bacon, guinness cheddar cheese and coleslaw. Now, this was served with a bowl covering it, as it is brought to the table in a cloud of smoke. Interesting choice. His opinion was that other than giving him a little bit of a coughing fit, it didn't appear to make too much of a difference to the dish. He found the whole thing to be ok. My burger was the Steak le Triomphe des Truffes. This was a burger topped with the Chef's own truffled gruyere cheese, a sweet balsamic truffle glaze and picked onions. I enjoyed mine. There is not too much to say about this visit as it was not bad, but it was not mind blowing either. It is a decent place to grab a burger if you are in the area or in Camden, Chelsea, Clapham and Balham. Having recently done a pop-up burger at Patty & Bun, I am still convinced that P&B is the reigning burger haven in London. Nothing has changed my mind about that so far. In terms of service, it flowed well. The only criticism was the waiters' insistence that we discuss BREXIT. Politics has no place at my birthday dinner. We were not impressed, plus our political opinions are personal and certainly not to be dragged out of us as dining guests by a stranger.",

However I went for a total curve ball choice of the duck burger!

As a burger fan, I typically don't expect too much from a new place, so I was pleasantly surprised. I did not go for anything 'special', just the normal burger with cheese on a brioche bun. Gorgeous. Very tasty.I will have to return to try out something new.",

    "text": "I loved Hach\u00e9! I thought that it was great! The decor was elegant inside and as we went on a Sunday afternoon, it wasn't too busy either which was an added bonus.I opted for a Falafel Lebanese burger as I was feeling in a veggie mood, and my dining partner opted for the special which was a Hoisin Duck Burger and we shared some fries, washed down with a Corona each. Beer and a burger - the best combination! We were given the option of a brioche bun or a ciabatta. I went for a ciabatta and my partner had the brioche.Oh my days, I think that has to be the best veggie burger I have ever had! The falafel wasn't dry, the harissa mayonnaise gave the burger a little kick whilst the tzatziki added a nice wetness to it. The fries were very moreish as well - kind of like posh McDonalds fries. I thought that the portions were really decent as well. My partner's duck burger had sooooo much duck in it that it was falling out as was my falafel. I'm not complaining, the more the better!!For dessert we share the baked caramel cheesecake which was okay. The caramel sauce was a bit too sticky for my liking, like it hardened then got stuck in my teeth, but it was still pretty good! Overall a great alternative to the usual burger chains such as GBK and Byron. And the prices and service wasn't bad either! I'm definitely going back again!!",

    "text": "Definitely worth a visit if you're a burger fan. There is a good selection of burgers available on the menu aswell as the sides. The brioche buns are among the best I've had and they don't become soggy which can frequently be the case. I had the Canadien burger where the patty was topped with bacon and cheese and was on top of a bed of rocket (I asked for it to be served without the tomato - no place in a burger!). The cheese served on the Bavarian burger is absolutely delicious so this would be worth a try too! One of the best burgers I have had in London and at quite a reasonable price.",

The place is pretty classy and service really good. I had the blue cheese burger which was good, and my friends had the Lousiana one with peanut butter. Both were really good. Good point, you can choose the cooking of your meat (which is not always the case in London) and the bread as well (brioche vs ciabatta - both were good).Definitely a place to go for a good burger.",

    "text": "My wife and I had been talking about going to he branch of Hache near South Kensington about a year ago. She had a recommendation from a work colleague. We never made the trek out there and that would be the end of a poor anecdote. However, while walking to another restaurant, we noticed another instance of Hache on Curtain Rd, near Old Street. I made a mental note to come here during my lunch hour.I was thinking I might get take away, but it wasn't clear that was an option. I just went with the flow and took a seat at one of the tables. There were not many people there, but this would mean a short waiting time.I got the bacon burger (I forget the exact name they had for it) and a side of fries. You could choose the type of bun and I went for the brioche. Not as full of sauce as others I have tried and the bun held up well. It was layered with tasty ingredients. It was a good burger.When I got the bill, it came with a little dish of Smarties, which was a cute touch.I would be happy to come here with a group of people from work.",

Don't let the very unassuming block where this unassuming restaurant-front is located dissuade you. The interior is very chic, service was friendly and fast. I got the day's special burger, the Southern Belle (with fried onions on gooey Pimento cheese, fresh baby courgette, crispy bacon, and smokey chilli mayo), my husband ordered the Steak le Fume. We also got a side of sweet potato fries. Everything was delicious! Although pretentious, the Steak le Fume was fun in its presentation, and smokey! The Southern Belle burger had so much texture and flavor going on all at once, it was an amazing burger! One of the best I've ever had!",

    "text": "I came across Hach\u00e9 on Yelp when looking for somewhere to eat in Hoxton to meet up with my boyfriend and a friend. I saw some pretty great reviews, saw that they won TimeOuts Best Burger in London award at some point and read the story of their business on their website, which I really liked. We booked a table in advance so we didn't risk losing out. We arrived 15 mins early but they seated us straight away. I love the decor - classy and sophisticated for what is essentially an American burger joint, and a great range of burgers on the menu. I found it hard to choose which one but ended up ordering the Rebluchon cheese as I've not eaten it before and i remembered reading a great review on Yelp about it. It was an excellent burger. I had it with the brioche bun and looking at the ciabatta I think I made the right decision. We ordered four sides for the three of us to share - sweet potato fries, wedges, onion rings and coleslaw. I can't fault any of it. The onion rings were huge and I really liked the crispy batter of them.We were pretty full after our burgers and sides but dessert was too tempting! We had a cheesecake to share, which was really light and creamy, and then my friend had a vanilla milkshake and my boyfriend and I shared a naughty milkshake with Oreo, Tia Mia and Baileys. It didn't taste very alcoholic but it was great. Perhaps a little pricey at \u00a36.95 but a nice treat.I'd definitely return to try another burger!",
