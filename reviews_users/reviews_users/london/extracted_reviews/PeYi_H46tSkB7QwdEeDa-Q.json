    "text": "I remember Tom's well for several reasons.First & foremost, for it being the single best meal I had in London for the week I was in town (my dining companion agreed whole-heartedly). The ironic thing? I think I had the burger (how American!), & I think we sat at the counter (how Passe!). BUT, the vibe of the place was decidedly laid back & casual, if the clientele were a bit upper crust. The bartender was French or Dutch or something (I can't remember as it's been awhile), & very attentive, engaging us in conversation & recommending drinks -- even hooking us up with a few tastes of various wines & spirits. Additionally, I was so satisfied with my meal that I left my expensive Nikon behind slung over my chair. Not two minutes later, the matre'd (who we had dubbed R.B.G., or \"really British guy\") literally ran down the block to return it to my possession. Seriously?! That's amazing. I'm sure it would've been gone forever in 9 out of 10 establishments. Forever grateful to the RBG & Tom Aikens' whole crew for that.Thus concludes this episode of How I Learned To Stop Worrying & Love Tom's Kitchen.",

    "text": "Tom Aiken's chose wisely when decided to open a restaurant;instead of going for a gastro-pub type thinghe chose the Brasserie style of eating. Having eaten there I can only describe it as being a trendy place to eat and worth every penny.It has soaring ceilings and some very neutral painted walls.There are plain laid tables only inches apart,which is not a good idea because other diners could overhear your conversation and the decibel levels can be so high at peak times,I found myself shouting to be heard.But the food was really worth it because its French cooking at its best-infact I would describe it as being inspirationally tasty.The Celeriac Remould was good to eat made with Bayonne Ham,Bouillabaise,accompanied by a rack of roast Lamb with a herb crust. It was prepared with care and exceeded all expectations. Simple things like Sour-dough bread,Leeks with Black Truffles,Lentils,Parmesan cheese were cooked to perfection.My friend had the a really seriously good buttery mash a spit-roast chicken with ceps and a side dish of Savoy Bacon made with smoked bacon-proving to be a brilliant combination. To round it all off with grand retro finish we indulged in a Baked Alaska for two. Good house wine starting at 13.00 pound a bottle.",

    "text": "please also seehungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  Sunday brunch at Tom's Kitchen and I was not impressed. This is the second restaurant by the Michelin starred chef Tom Aikens whose other restaurants include Tom Aikens in Chelsea and Tom's Terrace at the Somerset House. I had heard great things about this place especially for brunch and my expectations were correspondingly high. BUT, to my utter disappointment: Firstly, Tom's Kitchen is massively overpriced: 4 pounds for a small glass of orange juice? I know it's Chelsea, but please! Secondly, the service was unfriendly. They actually seemed to be annoyed to have customers and I was close to apologizing for the pure fact of my existence. Somehow they didn't make us feel very welcome Thirdly, the food didn't impress either. If you pay so much for breakfast you really want to enjoy every bite. This was not the case. The plain omelette for example was 8 pounds. If you wanted to add cheese, ham or mushrooms (to be honest, who really eats a plain omelette?), this would cost you 1 pounds each resulting in 11 pounds for an omelette. You would expected some kind of super ham or truffles for this price. However, it was ordinary ham in an ordinary omelette, which I have had better for half the price. The kids (not mine by the way) went for dishes from the American breakfast selection. They are American and they were not happy. The waffles (9) were unremarkable but ok, topped with some very heavy cinnamon cream and quite nice caramelized apples. The French Toast (9) however did not gain many fans on our table. The ridiculously thick piece of brioche just wasn't particularly good and most of it was left behind. We unanimously decided that we are not going to go back to there for breakfast. It might be really good for dinner, who knows, but I am not sure I am inclined to try it out.",

A group of 10 friends and I had dinner here to celebrate a special occasion. When I called ahead to make the rez they said that for parties that large we'd have to have the reduced size menu and emailed me it in advance, multiple times. Yet upon being seated, we had the normal sized menu, much to our surprise. The service was slow to start but got better throughout our meal. I had the beet salad for a starter and the crackling pork for a main. Both were tastey, but not not anything as amazing as I'd hoped. The baked Alaska as a shared dessert was pretty yummy, although giiiiinormous and even the TEN of us couldn't finish it. I enjoyed the decor and ambiance but the weird photos of Tom and his pigs on the wall are not the most inspiring. 2 stars for ambiance, coziness, the wine, and the food.",

The night before I got a voicemail from them asking me to call to confirm my reservation. That's a bit much. \u00a0But when we arrived - at 2 minutes before 10am, the hostess haughtily told us we were early and although we could be seated, we wouldn't be able to be served til they opened at 10am!! What arrogance! It is a horrible way to receive clients. But obviously, Tom's Kitchen must believe in demeaning clients so they'll feel grateful they can eat in their establishment. True, the brunch was good and the servers were MUCH friendlier and welcoming than the little gatekeeper at the front desk. I am happy to spend my money elsewhere if they don't value customers.",

Good manhattans and cosmos (for the daughter) and a decent coupe for me followed by fois gras with eggs and bacon - amazingly delicious! We had to order bread - ok and baked on the premesis - to soak up the juices, pointing to the fact that you don't automatically get it when you sit down. I suspect that reflects its high quota of slender young things who try not to nibble....). The restaurant is strong on meats of the heartier variety and the party had roast belly of pork, which was just that - very tasty with plenty of crackling. My lemon sole was a disappointment - rather small and undistinguished, but they usually are so it was my poor choice. Daughter had a beautiful birthday dessert without the awful knot of waiters singing tunelessly but calvados was third-rate and only good for cooking. We had a fine Australian pinot noir from the short list and the whole meal ran out at about \u00a36o a head....not bad for a noisy brasserie!",

I don't think I spotted the same thing being eaten around the room twice. Phil R chose a vanilla milkshake (what a maverick, eh??) and I had the fresh squeezed OJ (and I mean FRESH).... then he had the baked beans on toast with 2 fried eggs (although it was served to him with one egg, the waitress noticed and brought him an extra one later) and I had the porridge with bananas, raisins and brown sugar with a side fruit bowl (although my porridge came out sans fruit at first, which again our waitress corrected).So as you can see, our brunch was not without its faults, but was hearty and satisfying nonetheless. And if it's good enough for the man himself, its good enough for me. A definite to-try in London -- take my word for it.",

    "text": "OH. MY. GOD.A. Maze. Zing.Wait for it. I'll tell you the good bits, the one flaw to the place and try to describe that feeling that all my Christmasses had come at once after one of the best meals I have ever had ever.First things first, this place is NOT a \u00a3\u00a3 place. It's \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 at least. Just so we're clear on that. Don't go expecting a cheap eat.Now, I came here last night at the last minute. We'd been expecting not to get in as they had said on the phone earlier in the day that they were fully booked. So either they had a cancellation or they save some seats for first come, first served customers. So... give it a try if you're in the area.Here's a confession: I actually thought 'Tom's Kithen' was the other Tom Aikens place on Elystan Street. But no. Apparently that's more expensive.So.. Tom's Kitchen. We were tucked in next to the window, which in hindsight seemed a stroke of luck. It's a cool place with a casual vibe (with Kasabian and MIA on the playlist) but it seemed to get louder the more you walked through (the people, not the speakers) and the light chat we shared would definitely have been disrupted had we sat elsewhere.We shared the mussels to start and they were cooked to perfection. A really subtle but lovely sauce with enough mussels to feel like you'd actually had a starter, rather than the one-mouthful-for-a-tenner you get at some other up-market places in town.Then... fish and chips. Ree. Dick. Your. Loss. Your loss indeed. My gain - I ate it. Now, I've been to the Magpie Cafe in Whitby, which was recently voted the best fish and chips in all the land. When I had it there, I agreed. Not any more. Yes, you pay twice the price at Tom's as in Magpie's, but it was exquisite. Every bite was a joy. From the splendid homemade sauces to the lovely 'big' chips and the really succulent, fat fillet of fish, perfectly cooked in a light crunchy batter, I think I found a new 'last meal' for my Yelp profile.And then the cheesecake. I thought nothing could top off my main. It did. Too sweet for weaker souls, perfect for me. And all of this with a couple of glasses of Chablis.I was in food heaven, being treated like a saint. If there was a 6th star available, I'd use it.So, after all of that, you might feel like you've had a meal yourself. Do you want a summary?1. This place is not as cheap as Yelp thinks. But still absolutely worth it.2. No need to book.. necessarily. Don't deliberately not book, but try it even if you haven't.3. Sit next to the window if you can.4. Eat the fish and chips5. Die happy",

I didn't bother getting fish and chips anywhere else during our stay because I just knew that I'd only be disappointed after the fantastic version I had at Tom's Kitchen.

    "text": "Visited this lively restaurant to try a special lunch tasting menu for the Cloudy Bay shack (pop-up promotional stall) for this summer.The restaurant has a lovely feel to - very light and bright space with an open kitchen down the left and rear sides so all diners get to witness the bustle of the kitchen. Tables are light wood and the ceilings are high with original pillars and sweeping ceiling fans. Upstairs are a further 2 floors that feel much more like a private home - Victorian fireplaces and wooden floors, darker colours and comfy lounge chairs. The first floor has a smaller white marble bar and lounge and a dining area for more intimate groups. On the second floor a private dining room has a vast antique table for 12 and an ante room for drinks. My companion and I luckily got to meet chef Tom Aikens on his arrival to ply him with questions about a new venture before we enjoyed our meal. Tom is the youngest British chef to be granted a Michelin star and his passion for seafood and fresh fish is legendary.On this occasion we tried deep fried paprika squid and lime ( delightfully light with the batter melting off the squid in the mouth), salad of shredded dorset crab with chilli and ginger ( a zesty salad perfect for summer ), his famous seven-hour lamb (slow-cooked so the lamb falls off the bone with a wonderful gravy and mashed potato ) and a tomato salad with basil, watermelon, mint and crayfish tails ( amazing mix of sweet melon with salty crays and herbs). The quality of the food was amazing, really nothing to fault here it all. Service was swift and unobstrusive, our glasses were kept full and we both thoroughly enjoyed it!All the above dishes were devoured with chunky chips on the side and a bottle of Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc. At \u00a340-odd per bottle the wine was a real treat, with menu items varying from \u00a39-\u00a330 for the lunch menu. They open for breakfast as well as lunch and dinner, with breakfast items starting from \u00a34.00, so quite affordable.I'd recommend this for a group of friends or family to eat in the main restaurant, and use upstairs for a date or more stylish affair.",

One of the things I miss is good American breakfast items - pancakes, french toast, etc. The first time I ordered the blueberry pancake at Tom's I looked and it and thought, \"what on earth have they done!\" It was about an inch thick and covered the entire plate. I was so disappointed because I had heard good things about it. Then I took a bite. . . oh, my, god. So good! Not like mom used to make, so much better than mom used to make! One of the only times that I have seen Brits take an American staple, change it and have it come out better. I have also tried the burger, sausage and mash, english breakfast - all good.

The main reason why I've come here so many times is due to its close proximity to where I live. And if I am in the mood to take a friend somewhere nice in the neighborhood, this is the spot. They are also open until 11pm, which I appreciate. This place is packed 7 days a week so I recommend calling to make a reservation. It is small and quaint and the decor is very well done. It feels like home; candles on the wooden tables, with enough lighting that you feel like you are at home. They have a small bar area and an open kitchen, which I very much like. The fish and chips is well done, but small for what fish & chips should be. It is surely the fanciest fish and chips you will have. Their bouillabaisse is nicely done and surprisingly filling, they use saffron so it has a bit of a curry flavor. Their salads are very popular; simple and well made. I had their macaroni and cheese (it was recommended by the waitress) but they didn't mention the cheese they use (i was expecting cheddar) and it was a particularly stinky cheese that I did not like so I barely ate it unfortunately. They change their menu ever so often, and in the summer months they had a baked mussel dish with cheese and parsley, it was divine. The ambiance of the place is what must keep me coming back, that and the food is fresh and sourced from nearby English farms.",

A Wonderfully eclectic menu with all the best flavours of the autumn season.To start I had the Pan fried Foi Gras with a fried egg and caramelized Shallots. Hugely rich, flavourful dish, balanced rather nicely by the modest Rioja we ordered.For mains, I had the Oxtail and Lentils. The oxtail was delicious, fatty melt in you mouth goodness accompanied by delicious Lentils.Final word. This restaurant is an excellant casual dining choice.

    "text": "This is a really nice little restaurant in Chelsea where you will find some tasty grub. If you are looking for some meat then look no further. I am a full blown carnivore when it comes to eating out and nothing other than some bloody red meat will suffice. Fortunately Tom's Kitchen caters for that (though probably not much else). The menu reads well for carnivore's with burgers, lamb, steaks, steak sandwiches, pork and chicken in various formats. If you are a veggie or fancy some fish then I would think twice mind. I ate a steak sandwich and it was spot on. An excellent piece of beef, nice and tender. It came with chips and I salad (I think) and some nice bernaise sauce that did the trick. I can empaphise with the others that said the service was not great. It was not. It is probably the different between me rating this place a 3 and not a 4. The food is certainly 4/5 (on this scale) but the service and ambience let's it down. The service was slow and not very attentive. It did not spoil anything and they did nothing wrong, but there were no little things that bugged me (not offered bread, not offered a second drink, wanted mustard and had to wait etc). Despite there being around 10 chefs working and the restaurant being quiet we had to wait 25 minutes for a rare steak. I have a bit of an issue with the ambience too. It was fine, but the place is very Chelsea. Now some people may like this aspect, but I am not a fan. Yummy mummies float my boat in one respect, but the general burgeois atmosphere is off putting for me. As with many Chelsea places it is slightly pretentious, extremely white and middle class and a bit stuck up. Very Chelsea, but does some great grub. If you want some nice meat and can put up with a bit of snobbiness then give this a try.",

    "text": "When I first came here, I didn't know what Chelsea was, and thought, ok, that was some good food. Now I am learning all of the London stereotypes and I still think this place has great food. Yes, this place is SO Chelesa, but don't let that put you off. In fact, that is part of its charm -- the local human scenery. One side of London has hipsters. Other parts of London have other sorts. All make for great people-watching. Yes, here, you may see a man wearing pink jeans, a pink jumper (sweater) and pink socks with boating shoes, and it will make you smile. But don't forget that the reason you come here is because you will also have amazing food at Tom's Kitchen.I've been here about three times now, twice for dinner and once for brunch. The food is reliably great. It has cool exposed beams and other trendy knickknacks. The real reason you should come to this restaurant is to eat the slow-cooked lamb. They say this lamb is for two people, but it's actually for probably 3 or 4. Even though this may be the best lamb I've ever had, I've never been able to finish it. Oh, this lamb. It is cooked for five hours in a wonderful sauce that caramelizes along with the onions and carrots in it. The only comparable lamb I've had was a seasonal special at a restaurant in Paris that I believe had a Michelin star. They also have twice-fried chips (why do they stay hot for so long) and a great English breakfast. They have a starter that's a gigantic slab of foie gras which a friend orders every time. But it's the lamb you come here for.It's not cheap, but if you split the lamb 3-4 ways, it's not bad. Restaurants in Chelsea are generally not cheap.Gluten-free notes: Many of the dishes on the menu are naturally gluten-free.",

When we arrived at 10 am it was empty -considering it was breakfast time- except of us and two other people , the place interior looked below average as any of the local restaurants that you can find at covent garden and such places. We expected more of a classy place looking at the high ratings and the very good reviews. \u00a0We ordered 1 English breakfast for us to share -as the usual amount of such breakfast is usually huge for one person- along with a Salmon bagel and 1 coffee latee & 1 orange juice. And -their very famous & well recommended- french toasted apple for dessert.For me their breakfast was like any other breakfast you can have anywhere, nothing special flavour wise, I couldn't understand the fuzz about this place. Yet surprisingly the dessert that was recommended by the waiter was really really good & unbelievably tasty! It was literally the best part of our breakfast!! Their orange juice was very good & fresh too yet their coffee was a bit cold, we asked them to re-heat it yet it was returned to us a bit cold again. I would rate the whole experience 6/10. \u00a0Cheers!",

    "text": "Recently had a repeat visit at Tom's Kitchen. This has for a long time been one of my favorite restaurants in London but upon this first visit in around a year it was clear that the place has really gone downhill.We were there on a Friday night and I was surprised that it was that busy, maybe half-full. We were immediately greeted at the door and promptly showed to our places and within 30 seconds someone came and asked if we wanted a drink to start with. We just asked for water and then some more time to look at the drinks. Then for a very long time no water or anyone from the staff bothered to show their face at our table. The place was swarming with staff but they all seemed busy doing other things than taking care of the customers (chatting to each other, running around without any clear goal or task). After a long time (around 10-15 minutes) we managed to get the attention of a waitress and place our orders - also asked to have the candle at our table lit (was never lit). Food and drinks were ordered - still candle not lit.Interestingly enough we also noted that some tables received bread and butter and was a bit surprised that it was something that they charged extra for. Had not seen or noticed that on earlier visits but a bit surprised at that. Starters then arrived and had to remind them of drinks ordered and to have candle lit. The starters were however good. We had the spinach and crispy bacon salad. A delicious salad that really was great. We also had a small Mac&Cheese with truffles. This was also good but clear that they have cut down on both size of dish as well as the truffles. It is still a good dish but compared to what it used to be this was not as good. Water was at this point out at out table so next time a waitress came by we asked for water as well as to have the candle lit.The water arrived later but the candle would remain unlit for the duration of the dinner. We were amazed that the huge number of staff were unable to handle a room that was little more than half full of guests. Several of them were clearly stressed and showed signs of really not feeling comfortable working in a restaurant. For me it is fine that people are stressed but it should not be shown to the guests and the service should not suffer from it.The mains we went for the oxtail and the pork belly. The oxtail was delicious but could have been slightly more pink. The pork belly was good but all the sides there had some carrot in it so was a little bit too much of it -. would have benefited from some additional flavors. My recollection of being at Toms kitchen had always been that the size of dishes are always generous so never actually had room for a full dessert but it appears they have perhaps not only been saving on skilled waiting staff but also on the size of the dishes as we both could fit a dessert each.We went for the Apple&Blackberry Crumble as well as the Maple Syrup & Cinnamon Stick Creme Brulee. We were about to order tea but were never asked and the waitress rushed from the table before we got the chance to say anything. The desserts were good and they were really huge. To round off the evening of bad service we had to wait a long time to pay, eventually I had to stand up and state that I will be leaving unless they let us pay now and then we finally got to pay.So food is still good here, service deserves one star or less so doubt that I will be coming back as there are many places that serve good food and can at least manage something that resembles service.",

    "text": "Sunday Brunch. The most relaxing, carefree, soothing, indulgent meal in the world. A chance to catch up with friends and unfeasibly large newspapers, sip actual coffee, eat things cooked in butter and watch the world go by. Well not at this place it isn't.Having been told in no uncertain terms that we would need to vacate our half twelve table at 2pm sharp, our food arrived in dribs and drabs, the last of it - a stray bowl of chips which managed to escape its parent steak some ten minutes back - a great deal closer to Monday than one would like for a meal they called on their own menu Sunday brunch. In fairness, the staff conceded that they wouldn't be hurrying us out at the time they originally arranged with us but in all honesty the news came as something of a disappointment, so eager was I to skidaddle from this stressed out hellhole.The room is bright and airy, clean and simple. White tiled walls, solid wooden tables. But there are probably five or six too many of those. I noted as we bolted that the bar would probably be the best place to sit if I was ever hoodwinked into coming back. At least there your mindset is more conducive to hit and run dining.Our waitress was impatient beyond belief. She was outwardly exasperated when a nine year old and a ten year old pondered for roughly six seconds over whether to have lemonade or apple juice. She rolled her eyes at four seconds, puffed her cheeks out at five and assumed the teapot pose on six. I panicked and ordered for them, and that set the tone. Overworked, stressed out, thoroughly hating her job and boy didn't she want everyone to know it. For the rest of the meal it was impossible to grab her attention when we actually needed it but we were always aware of her presence, buzzing around like an angry wasp throughout our stay.Clearly there are too many tables and not enough staff. Maybe that's the rub when you dine in Chelsea in a place where prices are healthy but not sky high.My chicken and tarragon pie was nice when it finally came and for \u00a312 I'd say very reasonable if I weren't tainted by the relentless impatient clumsiness of the service and unwelcoming nature of it all.The chicken schnitzel looked fab although Marissa said the bed of vegetables it came on let it down. The eggs benedict or Florentine or whatever the one with salmon is called was delicious according to Deb . The children's food wasn't an afterthought either which is nice. Just a shame that the presentation of a kids menu was. We only got one after enquiring if the adult burger was big enough for two kids to share. Sean's steak was expensive and looked ordinary to me but Seany liked it.But the quality of the cooking is an irrelevance when the experience is this shitty. I was looking for a better word. One which is the opposite of relaxing. But shitty works well.When I got home I meditated and booked an acupuncture session. Happy to report, my channels are now running free again. Tom and his crew could do with some needles. Although I'm not sure where I'd stick 'em.",

    "text": "A lovely evening. Everything at Tom's Kitchen was lovely. We made a reservation for 4 on a Saturday night and had no trouble getting a table. We were able to wait upstairs and order drinks before our entire party arrived; and when everyone did, we were swiftly escorted to a table. The service was quick and efficient, but not overly pushy -- exactly what you'd expect at a restaurant of this calibre.Everyone really enjoyed their food. Dishes at our table ranged from the fish pie to shepherd's pie to the vegetarian special. I was a little disappointed there weren't more veggie choices on the menu because I'm sure they would've been delicious. Given the price, I'd likely come back here for special occasions rather than an everyday weeknight dinner, but it seems like the kind of reliable place where you'll always get great, fresh, farm-to-table food served with a smile.",

One of my favourite orders is Eggs Benedict, and more often than not I'm left disappointed (it's gone cold/ the muffins aren't crispy/ the ham is slimy or lacks flavour/ the hollandaise too lemony/ the eggs undercooked - which is a heinous crime, or the whole combination has just turned into an unappetising soggy mess. Bleurgh). \u00a0 Tom's Kitchen however, gets it so right - Hallelujah! It's one of the best Eggs Benedict I've ever had, and given how many I've eaten, that's high praise.It's worth noting this place gets really busy for breakfast at the weekend, so it's advisable to pre-book (which is easily done via their website).",

    "text": "5 stars, and here's why:1. Immediately greeted on entry (it's AMAZING how many places don't do this. As someone that comes from a family that owns a small business, it's hard for me to understand why you wouldn't want to lock down a customer and give them a great first impression).2. Excellent service - water glasses constantly refilled, order taken promptly, checked in with us, saw him looking over several times to make sure everything was going well.3. LAMB. LAMB. LAMB. I say it 3 times because I ate enough for 3 people. Even compensating for my friend who has a tiny appetite (we got the seven hour confit lamb which I insist you get too), I could barely at any more yet we probably had enough meat left for another 3-4 people. They offered to wrap it up for us but unfortunately the combination of delicious garlic and onion in a rich brown gravy would not have been an ideal combination with our next destination: a wedding dress shop. It was a tragedy to leave such beautifully soft, still pink meat. Probably the best lamb I've ever had.We arrived at about 12:30 and there were a still a few empty tables so it all felt quite relaxed and we weren't rushed at all. It's not a beautiful restaurant but it's going for the kitchen feel and at least it's not stuffy and intimidating.Overall this was a great experience. It's not cheap but the lamb was well worth it (also if you take it home you have enough for several more meals). Looking forward to my next visit!",

    "text": "I arrived at 9:30am on a Friday to a half-empty restaurant and was asked if I had booked the table for 2 I requested. Um, no. This would have been fine - maybe the server was just ascertaining whether I WAS the type of person to book a table 2 for 9:30 in the morning (the answer, no) - but he proceeded to cast his eye over the dining area hesitantly before offering me a 4-top table right by the window.I sat down to wait for my dining companion to arrive, ordered a rather riduculous \u00a33 americano, and perused the breakfast menu that looked quite fine. I was intrigued by both the poached pears with Greek yogurt and the freshly baked muffins of the day. My dining companion arrived over 5 minutes later. My americano hadn't. I put in an order for a \u00a39.50 bloody mary and continued waiting for my coffee. It eventually appeared without milk, despite the fact that I ordered it white, and the server turned and left with such haste that I had no time to point out the mistake. Several minutes later, it was time to order food - too late to rectify the coffee situation, sadly. I got the \u00a34 poached pears with Greek yogurt and the \u00a33.50 toasted brioche with strawberry jam - because (at 9:30am on a Friday) the muffins I wanted had 'sold out'. The poached pears were presented in a bowl, submerged in their poaching water. They genuinely looked and tasted as if they'd come from a tin (their hand-peeled appearance was the only thing belying this). \u00a0And the Greek yogurt - while rich and dense - was less than abundant, sitting in a teeny tiny ramekin on the plate nestled next to the pear bowl. The brioche confused me - a thick slice of bread that was dry, savoury and not at all light or buttery - and its accompanying strawberry jam was more like a stingy portion of watery compote. The bloody mary was pedestrian. The americano, mediocre. Overall - NOT GREAT.Furthermore, I found the service a bit woeful. I had to repeat everything I said twice (my accent isn't THAT weird), which became incredibly annoying - I'll be honest.The location itself was bright and open, but filled exclusively with Rah and Hooray Henry types. The plaque over the entryway that states rather overbearingly 'FOOD FOR EVERYONE AND ANYONE' might have well said 'Food for people in Chelsea with too much money and too little taste'.The only redeeming factor would be that Tom Aikens was in the kitchen. Although, then again, based on the quality of the food I received under his watch this might actually be a bad thing.",

The only problem I had was that the service was terrible. Our waiter misheard our orders multiple times, there was no discernible manager on the floor keeping control of service. Furthermore there was a complete lack of communication between staff, now I don't know if this was due to the fact that it was a Sunday night or just incompetence. Overall if you come here you will receive very good classic brasserie dishes, but at the trade off of quite bad service.",

I had to make last minute reservations for a company dinner and found this little gem on the Internet and was also highly recommended by the Concierge at St. Ermin's.We started with Spicy crab cakes which was the perfect portion for an appetizer. I ordered the Pan Fried Cornish River Trout with a side of ratatouille and fries (quite surprised they didn't label them as chips). The trout was very crunchy on the outside and slightly flavored with caper and raisin dressing on the inside. I had roasted cauliflower and carrots to go with the fish plus paired with a glass of Sancerre, it was a perfect combination for a light, healthy and tasty dinner. A slight mishap was they served me Gazpacho instead of ratatouille, which they quickly amended after I told them about it. Otherwise, great service, great hole in the wall spot and the ambiance of wooden tables with lamps was a nice change from the busy and loud streets of London!",

Really good time there though, especially as the place wams up into the evening with people coming for drinks and diner.

I came with my husband early one morning and the restaurant was mostly empty except for just a couple other people. We were seated in this brightly lit and modern place and not sure what to expect. We were in for such a lovely treat! We ordered a bunch of food because yolo. I got the Eggs Royale, Ben got the Full English Breakfast with tea and then we added French Toast because everyone raves about it.You can tell they use quality ingredients, just by cracking the egg. The yolk was a lovely orange and so delicious with the hollandaise and salmon. Ben's Full English was also great, It also came black pudding, which we seemed to have some trouble getting at other places. No matter, we got it here and that was also great. The baked beans were in a separate bowl, which was nice since it didn't get all over the place and make the bread soggy. The French Toast was AMAZING. I felt awful for having dessert for breakfast but then I look back and am so glad I ate it. It was topped with apples and a vanilla bean cream. Really lovely.Overall, this was a top notch experience. It's right around from our flat and I cannot wait to introduce Tom's to others!",

    "text": "After being in New York for so long I thought I knew everything about food. This is still true, so understand this review comes from a place of deep expertise, decades honed shoveling amounts of nutritious (and sometimes non-nutritious) food into my face across several continents. I have been going to London for most of my life and never really saw it as the food capital of the Global North. The British are responsible for the chippy sandwich, therefore I have a tendency to view everything with suspicion. But my brother and his partner live off South Ken and we often found ourselves on the empty end of several bottles of wine and dining out seems a better option than trying to finally figure out how this damn oven works, goddammit, how do ovens work? And Waitrose closes at 9pm, which is just another feature of why British society will never recover from Brexit, but I digress.They suggested making a reservation for later that night if available (a note: do try to make a reservation) and we were lucky, seeing as it was a friday night on a very warm July weekend. People really missed out, I'm telling you. We walk all the way there and it was a bit of a wait for a table for three, so we were seated at the bar. I immediately loved the fact that the cocktail menu only offered four gin-based cocktails. For some, it may be paucity of the imagination, poor knowledge of the world wide web of available gin distillery, or simply pure intellectual laziness of the liver. Despair not, friends, because three of those cocktails are incredible, and the only reason I can't comment on the fourth is because we were a party of three.The Chelsea Garden comes with a four-star recommendation from my extremely gin-friendly tastebuds especially on a hot day. It's fresh, it's slightly tangy but not too much, and it's a great distraction from the fact that not all gins are Sapphire or Hendrick's (the latter I adore, but one day, you should try saffron gin and comment on this to tell me it hasn't changed your life. I triple-dare you).Brother-in-law ordered a fish and chips, and brother and I split a vegetarian platter. I thought it was overly expensive, even for the side streets besides King's Road, but I was feeling really comfortable and wanted to have a good time, so opened myself to being dazzled. Did I mention it was hot and I was drinking? So, yes. The food came quite quickly. I would post a photo if I could, but the fish was bigger than my friend's face. He's an average-sized, skinny guy and it took the three of us to finish eating the entire fish (we hate waste and so should you). The chips were thick, oven-cut, absolutely not greasy, and came with any sauce one could ask for (they serve it with tartare, of course, but the boy being american, he just couldn't be deterred from mayonnaise). The fish was cooked to perfection; the breadcrumb coating, again, not greasy, but not too crunchy that it would feel they were trying too hard making a staple of British culinary experience something that it was never supposed to be. It was a great fish and chips. The kind of fish and chips that will never be served in a newspaper cone, or that will never clog your arteries, but if that's what you're into, you just don't go to Tom's Kitchen. You go to Tom's Kitchen to treat yourself, to impress a date without appearing to try too hard, to have some family time with difficult in-laws, that sort of thing. Or maybe it's a friday in July and they have room because it's your lucky day.Let's talk about why I'm here with you all today, which is the vegetarian platter. Ordinarily, vegetarian food can be optional in non specialized restaurants; they are bland, tasteless and boring versions of what the meaty plates are. It seems some restaurants just want to punish you with just a bunch of boiled cabbage (to be fair, the aforementioned staple of British cuisine) and just two potatoes. But no. Not Tom's Kitchen. They won't do this to you, because they understand food comes from all the possible food groups, and you can tell they're having fun. Those were the most simple of platters: carrots, hummus, tomatoes, and avocado. See, this menu blew my mind because it was that simple. The carrots were served with ginger and curry; the hummus was entirely home-made; tomatoes dripped in lemon, the avocado with fresh pepper. It was wonderful and almost sexy because everything was evidently, obviously, deliciously fresh. Market-fresh. Just brought over by a bunny rabbit fresh.We ordered potatoes, too, because we're children: mashed potatoes, cooked to perfection with chives, and buttered jacket potatoes, coming from the Narnia of all gardens and once again, not drowning in butter, but enough to be tasty and about to make you thank the cow for such a contribution to gastronomy. This would make any of your veg-reluctant friends cross over to the dark side. I hear they have desserts. I can't wait. Save me a space.",

Bf had full English. It looked ok and he said it was fine but nothing amazing. We also ordered a breakfast martini and glass of champagne and both were goodAfter we ordered coffees but bf arrived and mine hadn't been made - not sure what happened thereOverall some good food, some ok good and average service for a relatively high price!",

    "text": "The food was very good here but I had a really weird experience. I ordered squid as a main, but the waiter brought me quail. I asked if the plate was meant for somebody else, and he proceeded to explain to me what quail is (side note: i know what quail is). Still confused, I started explaining that I had ordered squid when one of the chefs jumped from behind the counter to our table and started loudly explaining what quail was to me a second time. I'll eat pretty much anything, and they seemed REALLY adamant about me eating this quail that I just kind of rolled with it. After they left, I asked my fiance if I was losing it, and he told me he heard me order squid, so I'm not crazy. Four stars for food but minus two for aggressively gas-lighting me into thinking I ordered quail.",

We tried a couple cocktails, all of them were great. The blushing dragon was a bit sweet, but with fresh mango in it, that's expected I suppose. Fish and chips came with a nice big piece of flaky fish, the mussels were plump with an amazingly rich broth, and the kids menu has a great variety of items to choose from. We were even given a kids activity bag that my 4 1/2 year old loved. Great experience, and we will definitely be coming back. Thanks Toms Kitchen!",

Wife's steak sandwich was alleged to be good but I didn't try (though it was an open-face sandwich, something I think should be specified on a menu).Even my beer was lukewarm.",

The food was good once again, the staff was very attentive and let us order off the lunch menu since we'd just landed from the US. The drinks were very good, tasty bloody mary. The fish and chips are very good here too. Worth visiting for some good farm to table cuisine.",
