    "text": "This is my favourite place for breakfast in London, but I haven't tried them all! Firstly it is very crowded, especially on sunny mornings so be warned! The atmosphere is good, hectic but relaxed and friendly. The menu is good but I always go for the farmhouse breakfast - traditional but with really good quality ingredients which make it delicious and so much better than a breakfast with cheap ingredients. The feedback from others that I eat with has been similarly good - the eggs benedict/royale and the pancakes are both recommended. Having said that it is not perfect - the black pudding spicing is not to everyone's taste and on my last visit yesterday my partner's eggs royale were cold and overcooked and my bacon seemed to be a smaller portion than usual. Overall it is well worth a visit, good quality and tasty, I recommend you try it.",

    "text": "Pavilion Caf\u00e9 - Victoria Park, E9 - Pics @ The London Foodie (thelondonfoodie.co.uk/20\u2026 ) Dr G and I recently had a Saturday morning outing from Islington to Victoria Park, jogging along Regent's Canal. Tired but exhilarated on one of the few beautiful summer days this year, we staggered to the refurbished lakeside Pavilion Cafe for a reviving breakfast. The lovely glass rotunda is encircled by a mishmash of tables made from old wooden benches and chairs overlooking a splendid lake and fountain. Apart from the charming location, the real draw is the food which is a real cut above what you might expect in a public park. Delicious dishes are written up on blackboard walls, with the likes of Eggs Benedict (with ham) \u00a36.50 or Royale (with smoked salmon) \u00a37, and variations on English breakfast. The ingredients are all well sourced (Ginger Pig meats, Monmouth coffees) and, where possible, organic. The only downside is the place's popularity - on a sunny day it's invariably over-run. Fortunately, there are more seats next to the lake, so it's worth taking a numbered marker and waiting at one of the tables for your food to arrive. Normally we go for the Eggs Benedict or Eggs Royale but on this occasion, we opted to try the cafe's cooked breakfasts. I ordered a Pavilion Breakfast @\u00a38 (fried egg, bacon, sausage, mushroom, roast tomatoes, home baked beans and toast). Dr G had the Farmhouse Breakfast @\u00a38.50 (2 eggs, bacon, sausage, black pudding, homemade beans and toast), with two steaming mugs of orange-brown coloured 'builder's tea'. The breakfast options we chose were of course fairly standard however the quality of the ingredients made all the difference - the black pudding was richly flavoured, with a gamey, spicy quality while the bacon was thick, irregularly cut and with a pleasing texture. The baked beans were homemade, with the skin of the yielding beans still in place, a delicious, richly concentrated and herby tomato sauce, thankfully lacking the artificial taste of the tinned equivalent. The tea was good and strong as befits this kind of breakfast. Cost: \u00a38 to \u00a38.50 for the cooked breakfast + \u00a31 per mug of builder's tea. Likes: great lakeside location, delicious homemade, organic produce and excellent brunch menu. Dislikes: On a summer weekend, the place is packed, the kitchen and serving staff struggle to cope and service may vary from charming to plain rude. Verdict: A wonderful venue for a lazy breakfast or brunch after a night on the tiles. The quality of ingredients is good with prices to match. Recommended.",

Also, being run by Kiwis, they do a pretty good line in coffee. Perfect sunny day breakfast and will put a smile on your face for the rest of the day. Two minor words of caution: watch out for all the buggies, and make you sure you've got cash.",

Eating outside or in, it is just on the edge of the pond with green all around and great views of the ducks and local fisherman??Open early in the morning - the moms with toddlers are there with groups of joggers rewarding themselves with fair-trade coffee and juice. During \u00a0the weekend though it really gets busy.The cafe used to be very fry up/ cheap and cheerful - but these days is much more about being \"green\" and \"organic\". With a new post it board full of advertisements for \u00a0yoga and pilates -it \u00a0is all \u00a0better tasting and of course more expensive. Breakfast of granola with stewed apple banana and yoghurt is \u00a35.50 - lunch prices can be \u00a37.00 -The view is lovely and the park big and well kept - the little dock out into the pond allows you to really see the many birds including passing Canadian geese and swans.I am not sure what the fishermen are catching it is all very mysterious - and if they catch anything whatever do they do with it ??",

As the owner used to own a tea stall at Borough Market he still has good connections to other sellers; The quality of the food (and the tea, of course) is therefore way above average. There is also good selection of home-made cakes. Whether prices are too high in this light is debatable. (Tea: 1 pound, americano: 1,50)",

It's rare to find cafes in the many parks of London that really care about Food and the Pavilion is incredibly focused on proposing great food (and coffee) to its local clientele. With lots of tables around the pavilion facing the lake and trees of this beautiful park, this is a perfect place for a brunch or tasty lunch outdoor. One can even do a pique-nique seating on the grass around the pavilion, it's very relaxed atmosphere. This success (again on a sunny day) comes with a price, ie a long wait for food The food is classic brunch with eggs, bacon and all kinds of ways, and mediterranean with plates and sanwiches with hummous, mozzarella, ... It's fresh, healthy and home-made kind of food (oh and organic too, but who isn't these days :-). Not sure what this looks like in teh winter though as the indoor area is so small",

The meat feels like it is sourced from Ginger Pig which shows you the high quality of the ingredients. The bread was lovely and fresh. The black pudding was something else, I believe small pits of bone marrow had been laced through it but saying that you get a nice bone full of bone marrow anyway. To top it all off, it is served with this amazing homemade baked bean concoction that I could've eaten a huge plate off on its own. Bonus points all round for this place, especially if you're sitting outside on a Sunny Morning in the park overlooking the pond/lake.

They do a range of coffees, smoothies, juices, sandwiches, healthy cereal bars, etc, with most items being \u00a32 or less. I ordered a Mocha Espresso, to the consternation of the serving lady. Apparently she'd never made one before We had a bit of discussion of how it should be made (the menu said chocolate, espresso and hot milk, so that's what she mixed!). The result wasn't posh looking (no foaming head or sprinkle of cocoa dust), but tasted great. And at \u00a31.20 for a big disposable cup full these days it's certainly a bargain. There are picnic tables to sit at with view out over the park (perhaps you'll see a cricket game). The server joined us to sit in the sun between customers.",

Here, I'll list a few:-Treat your mum for Mother's Day, get her something vegan and she'll be proud of you-Turn up with the lads still a bit waved from the night before and sort out that hangover with a massive veggie breakfast (seriously works, did it the morning after my birthday, tbh I was still waved after eating. No headache though. After food I proceeded to the pub across the road, had a vodka, kept the party going). -Just broken up? Go for a lonely walk around the pond and then end up here, eat the food and realise how amazing it would be to share the food with someone, oh wait...-Find someone new, take her/him out on a date and impress with all the avocado-Just finished your 5k? Refule here-Can't be asked finishing your 5k? Just go to pavilion and eat. It can sometimes be hard to find a seat inside, so you may just be standing around for a bit. If it's just two of you it should be all kush. During the summer there's lots of outdoor seating. Give it 5 mins and you'll find a seat. Views of the pond are awesome 13/15Food is peng 8/10 (though if you sit outside it all cools down fairly quickly, meh, life)8.3/10",

All of the little bits just went so well together- I especially liked the addition of avocado and halloumi cheese. My Sri Lankan dish was also really great- it had curry, egg, a unique noodle thing and more bits that I don't even know how to describe but eating them all at once together was delicious. Not only is it a superb location but the food is great and came out on time. Win win WIN!",

The pavilion today serves really good brunch food, quality, healthy and delicious good food rivalling those in proper restaurants. The operation here is serious with the staffs to match. This is not your usual cafe by the pond in the park, serving canteen-ish reheated meals. I was craving pancakes this visit, but every dish which comes out of the kitchen is mouth watering and appetising. Pancakes was perfect, added extra strips of bacon and it was heavenly. \u00a0Food is sourced locally, and big emphasis on organic and freshness. Turnaround is very quick, so don't be put off by not getting a seat. And what I like about here is, even though people pay for their food first, no one hogs their seats, quite considerate actually, seems most people eat, then go. Service is efficient, quick and very friendly. This is definite one of my favourites cafes to eat, but also a long standing one.",

Alex and I decided to take a wonder up to Victoria Park and having recently read some great reviews about the Pavilion Cafe we decided to give it a try. It was the first day of Spring so the place was packed but we queued up, ordered our food and we were able to grab a table with ease. They haves quick turn around so people are respectful of leaving the tables once they've finished eating.The staff are friendly and welcoming and the park setting is just stunning! I literally fell in love with Victoria park all over again because of this cafe.I opted for the avocado and poached egg on toast with a side of halloumi and Alex had the pancakes. My order arrived within 10 minutes but Alex's was another 10 minutes on top of that which was disappointing and the reason I haven't given the cafe 5*.My food was however wonder. The egg was cooked to perfection, the avocado was seasoned perfectly with a hint of lime and the halloumi was an amazing added bonus - thick, creamy and grilled just right.Once Alex received his pancakes he enjoyed them. I had a bite and even I, not being a fan of thick pancakes, can say they were good.Overall we had a wonderful experience and on my return I will definitely be trying the veggie breakfast as it looked fantastic! I would highly recommend to anyone!",

    "text": "It's always a treat to brunch (it's a verb now, don't you know) at Pavilion Cafe but I do make sure it's a once in a while occurrence. An avocado bacon sandwich costs around \u00a36, Italian style (small) coffees are costly and often inconsistently made. Sometimes cold, other times astringent.Full breakfasts are filling and indulgent. If I remember correctly there is a vegan option too but I don't know if it's a permanent part of the menu. Around \u00a39 a portion.What makes this place one of the better brunch spots in the East, if not all of London, is the view. Since there are very few indoor seats, you'll have to opt to sit outside either at the bar style seats overlooking the boating lake or the large picnic tables set nearby. It can be a chilly experience if you've not prepared as there is never any outdoor heating but if you're afraid of the cold then what are you doing out in the park in wintertime?It's good news for parents (of dogs and children) since the outdoor seating arrangement means there's plenty of space for them too. In the summer, I would stay away from the iced coffees. At \u00a32 each and quite small in size, they seem pretty bad value for money. Not to mention they're pre-made and then left with ice cubes in them, watering them down for an hour before you come along seeking to quench your thirst and caffeine addiction.",

    "text": "The perfect Sunday consists of going for a run around Victoria Park and then refuelling here. The food is healthy, generous and comes to your table super quick. There's plenty of seating inside where you order or if you prefer to watch the park go-ers, ducks and swans outside; there are lots of benches to park yourself on for a couple of good hours or so. This place isn't as crowded closer to about 1-2pm. I'd highly recommend the smashed avo with poached egg on toast, and then grab any one of the hot drinks because they're all ace. Winning combination of a run and brunch because... you can't spell BRUNCH without RUN ;-) (Sorry, just had to!)",

    "text": "The absolutely wonderful thing about The Pavilion Cafe is that it doesn't just rely on its scenic location to draw people in. It actually serves delicious food.I've been here for brunch and lunch (which is the same thing, really), and have loved my orders as well as become jealous of what everyone else had ordered. Yes, it's a bit more yuppie/posh, but the fact is that it's just good stuff they pack into their food AND they bake their own bread.The vegetarian breakfast is BIG and filling, but I ate every bit of it because it was so yummy. In addition to the beans, eggs, tomatoes, and toast - which were all freshly cooked - they include this mash that's ridiculously good. The other great option for veggies to try is the Sri Lankan curry. It's quite a spectacle when it comes out and you definitely look quite gluttonous, but it's actually not as heavy as you'd think. Great, unique flavours that are worth a try when you're feeling adventurous.It's been reported to me that their sausage burger and pancakes are also very good, so I guess there's just a lot to choose from if you're in the mood for a hearty, solid breakfast or brunch!I probably should note that I'm not a fan of their iced coffees, since they sit in their fridge for a while rather than being freshly poured or made, so I'd stay away from those if you're really into coffee. But their flat whites aren't too bad.Another thing that might be worth knowing is that the wait for the food is quite long, which might not leave a great impression on you if you're absolutely starving when you order. Plan to wait for a good while, and you might have to be quick to nab a seat, but, in my opinion, it is worth the wait.",

    "text": "The food is possibly second best to the setting in Victoria Park but if their food wasn't as delicious as it is, I wouldn't return as often as I do. Their own sourdough is delicious and chewy, perfect for brunch with eggs. My only complaint is that with the avocado and poached eggs, you get two slices of bread but only one egg. (?!) Other than that, I love everything about this place. The staff are friendly at the registers and even if they are sometimes a bit slow, they make yo for it with a smile. Once the cook making my bacon sandwich saw the hungry look on my face as I waited for my take away order, and assured me that it was coming up soon!",

    "text": "Best bacon sandwich in east London! I don't even like bacon, but this one I can't pass up.Service is friendly, interesting menu and lots of outdoor seating to enjoy the view of the pond. I like biking here for lunch and then going around the park afterward, watching people feed the ducks, take picnics, take their strollers for a walk... Minus one star because it's on the expensive end for a cafe in a public park, but that seems to be the trend these days.",

    "text": "Love the location. But had an accident there and management didn't do the right thing!! Their deck had a hole in it and the leg of my stool went into the hole. The stool was quite high and thus it was a far fall which hurt my back. They agreed to pay for me to go to the doctor since the accident was due to a lack of maintenance of their facilities. But, they never did anything. I was in touch with them multiple times. They asked for receipts and they literally then ignored me again and again. Given that this is a very popular place with parents and children I would sadly have to say AVOID",
