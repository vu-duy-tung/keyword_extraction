    "text": "I have been on two first dates here and have decided it's the perfect venue for them. Of course there's the Asian fusion food which is fabulous. But only a foolish first-dater would commit to an entire meal with someone who, let's face it, might bore your pants off within five minutes/pick their nose/eat with their mouth open/yell at the waiters. So in E&O we have the perfect compromise. It's very lively, which provides some much needed noise when conversation peters out. Plus, it's dimly-lit - great if you have lied about your age/height/looks. What's more you can order some finger food there and try and eat it sexily with chopsticks (I have not managed this yet). Crucially, the loos are a good way from the bar downstairs, and it's easy to slip away home from them unnoticed if sparks don't fly. I'm obviously being a little negative. You might get on famously, in which case you have the fun of trying to secure a table in the restaurant - impossible if you're a muggle and haven't booked years in advance, but quite easy from 10pm. I went on a first date here recently and it didn't disappoint, although no sparks.",

My trip to E&O gave me two in one - Stella McCartney and Damon Albarn in the same room at lunch, midweek (they weren't together I hasten to add). Anyway, that aside, E&O has food to die for if you love pan Asian food this is great. Favourites? Sticky spare ribs were delicious, tempura with its perfect batter and above all else black cod, which took my taste buds to heaven. It's a little pricey here, but great for a fabulous lunch close to Portobello but away from the crowds - take a good friend, invest in a bottle of wine or two, eat amazing food - and take turns to scan the room (discreetly) for famous faces",

In all honesty, I never even bothered looking through the windows. After being invited to dinner there by a friend, this is definitely on my list of places to return to. Any place that has black cod on the menu does it for me, really. It was a little piece of heaven, and a bittersweet experience having it as the portion (which is usually the case with black cod) wasn't particularly large. The sushi selection isn't huge, but our sashimi and rolls were fresh and tasty. The duck salad was interesting and something I'll be ordering again. All of these overshadowed the pad thai, but as a pad thai on its own it ticked all the boxes. Did I mention they have black cod there? Great food, good service. A good option for a smart/casual dine when you want to stay away from the chains.",

Some Asian restaurant make a big song and dance about their dim sum but then really let you down, E and O was one of the best I have had, I was starving after a hard days work and everything was so fresh that you could tell that each dish had come straight from being cooked, so tasty. As for the prices, we all had dim sum and our table must have seen about 20 dishes, including drinks, that being the tradition Jasmine Tea, the bill was around \u00a3120, I thought that was reasonable really, as it was such a trendy place, and supposedly popular with celebrities.",

On a recent hunt for cocktails, I discovered that they actually make a pretty good cocktail at E&O! The dirty martinis and old fashioneds were passable here, which is more than I can say for most places. But the other mixed drinks I tried were very good examples of what they should be.

    "text": "Great Thai style food. Be warned it is spicy for most people. I had the prawn red curry which was lovely. The restaurant was a bit too hip and told us they were busy and would need 40 minutes to be seated, yet I grabbed a table within 12 mins on open table while waiting to be seated (I hate that shit!). Music is way too loud, but the meal was good.",

    "text": "When you find yourself in an unfamiliar (not to mention extremely upmarket) borough of London for a friend's wedding, deciding where to go for dinner without having to remortgage first could have been a challenge.My preconceptions of Notting Hill were found to be unwarranted however, as we stumbled across E&O. From the front you'd think it was just a bar, as it was noisy and bustling with drinkers. Walk through towards the back and you'll find their dark, relaxed, modern-looking restaurant space. It's rather minimal looking, with wooden slatted walls and uplights.Service was efficient and friendly throughout the meal; we were asked for drinks and brought menus as soon as we sat down. We had edamame beans to nibble on whilst we had a look (I wish someone had told me beforehand that you're not supposed to eat the pods - newbie failure!).My tuna sashimi was very good but the portion size (for me) was a little on the small side. My friend's crispy pork belly dim sum was the winner. The lamb rendang and sweet potato curry was truly delicious. Accompanied by a bottle of white wine it made for a satisfying, and relatively wallet-friendly, evening of Asian fusion.",

Sometimes I'm a bit weary of fusion restaurants, but this place was just spot on.From the moment we walked in, I was overwhelmed with plate after plate of gorgeous looking food racing out of the kitchen. The menu is an eclectic mix of various Asian cuisines ranging from Japanese, Korean, Thai and Vietnamese, classic dishes and flavours given a modern makeover.I also love sharing small plates, and among our top dishes were the black cod shu mai, the sea bass carpaccio with truffle and fresh tomato, and the king prawn tempura. All beautifully presented and just fantastic. And dessert- I'll admit a banoffee pie was the last thing I expected the see on the menu, but if you like this dessert, order it!! Presented in a jar, it was loaded with lush caramel, cream and fresh bananas. Oh...em..geeThe only thing stopping this place from earning a full 5 starts from me was the service- it started out well, but the rotating servers and lack of attention was a bit disappointing. Won't stop be coming back for the delicious food!!",

I can vary a lot from day to day how busy or not the restaurant is, so we've always found it's better to be safe than sorry. \u00a0 E&O do a great range of dim sum, but the menu has a range of Asian cuisine from Japan, China, Thai and Korean - so there's a great selection to pick from. The pork gyoza are a particular favorite, along with the avocado & sweet potato tempura. It's worth getting a few dishes to share on the table, as the servings aren't the biggest but the fresh ingredients and great flavors make up for that.",

We tried the Gyzoza, Pork Belly, Pork Ribs, Watermelon and Duck salad and had non-alcoholic drinks spiked with booze. When you don't want to feel guilty about drinking in the mid-afternoon one must hide it in a ginger smoothie. The food was really tasty and the drinks were great. There was a mix of hipsters with crazy mustaches and hand tattoos and mums with toddlers. Odd mix, but then again, it was 3 in the afternoon. The coffee was delicious but it was had a ton of chocolate powder when it was supposed to be a non-chocolate drink. Whatevers, a little bit of cacao didn't hurt anybody. I think the statement that its a cheaper Nobu really hit it on the head.",

From the folks waiting outside, the people seated inside and out, and the full bar area (completely packed). Good looking people.Service was pretty good, a bit inconsistent in the beginning but better as the night wore on. Dish explanations were quite helpful.I highly recommend the lychee & tomato cherry curry. Rice is not included - charged as a side. Large enough portion for one person's full meal. The cod is very good but also pricey at \u00a333! The sashimi was fresh and the sushi rolls ok (nothing to to talk about though). The chili salt squid and edamame are fine starters for the table. And the banoffee pie for dessert is delightful.Being in London less than a week by this time, I hadn't found a meal I enjoyed until this one. And I know it wasn't the wine talking! Good food. Good quality. Pricey but won't break the bank if you steer clear of the expensive mains.Little early for lunch right now but thinking of that curry has me hungry....",

I mean, it had a modernist twist, lots of black white, yes... but \"hip\"? \u00a0I would say not-quite. \u00a0It was really really crowded, and all the tables are shoved so close together that you're practically dining with the table next to you... plus, the noise level was more than a few decibels above what I consider imperative for a very chic or refined dining experience. \u00a0Not that I didn't like it - I did. \u00a0I'd come back on a casual nothing of a Thursday night - but I *do* wish we'd chosen elsewhere for his birthday dinner - and would not recommend it to others for semi-special occasions.",
