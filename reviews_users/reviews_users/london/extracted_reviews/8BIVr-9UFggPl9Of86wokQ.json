I should have taken the picture of this, it was a bit ridic.2. Butter and grill your bun if you're going to call yourself american style for all that's holy3. Offer if the guest wants it plain, mayonnaise or lightly buttered. \u00a0Don't assume we all want your \"special\" mayonnaise4. Sort out reservations, if I could actually make a decent reservation and have a table for within a reasonable amount of time to rocking up, I'd rock up a whole lot more.Otherwise thanks for the reasonably priced (well for UK here..) lobster!

I normally wouldn't spring for a \u00a320 burger (a man must have principles) but since somebody else was buying I went for it. (It is worth noting that the burger, whose patty is substantial, also comes with a salad and chips, so that \u00a320 figure does include some extra gear.) It was a damn tasty burger, though a bit busy and unwieldy; there's something to be said for a burger marked by its simplcity and economy, rather than complexity and size (the Lobster & Burger burger takes those latter descriptors). Still, when you put beef, cheese, bacon and bread together its hard to go too wrong, and this burger was mostly right. The ambiance is pleasant and the service attentive and friendly.

    "text": "Fabulous!!! I've been hearing rave reviews of this place for a year, yet still hadn't managed to make it until this past monday night. I went to the one in the City, as I work right next to it. My girlfriend and I went for an early dinner, and as it was a Monday it was fairly empty. The waitstaff were incredibly friendly, helpful and attentive. The seats were very comfortable, and the whole place was terribly clean and cosy. My friend chose the steamed lobster, and I chose the lobster roll. Everything came with chips and salad. The salad was wonderful, I really liked it, and the chips were good, but not great. The lobster looked fabulous, and my lobster roll was DELICIOUS, though perhaps a bit too lemony if that's possible. We both enjoyed the house white wine, which wasn't bad. \u00a320 for the lobster is excellent value, and even for the lobster roll not bad. I'm not sure who would visit a place that serves lobster at that price and order a burger, but to each his own... There was also a vast menu of cocktails designed to match your food, which looked delicious, however I am a wine lover so stuck to the wine. This being the City branch, it had a definite 'City boys' atmosphere. It felt like the kind of place business deals would be made, with a rich mahogany and deep red interior. I'm curious to see what the interiors of the other branches are like.I will definitely be back!",

For \u00a320 you get lobster and chips and a mouth watering sauce to go with it. They don't provide quite enough sauce but staff are friendly and will bring more if needed.The vibe is nice with soft lighting and background music etc.Yeah, definitely worth returning to this place esp when there's no queue!

We came mid week at just before 1800, and were immediately seated.The menu is in the name.. Burger or lobster (lobster roll also an option) I've tried both the burger and the lobster (steamed) the burger was \"ok\" not the best, and add in its \u00a320 and it becomes even less appealing. The lobster was actually really good (I say this as I'm not a regular lobster eater, I see them as overly complicated giant prawns) they have done all the hard work in breaking it up into easily manageable sections and provide the tools to ensure you maximise the meat, the more experienced lobster eater will probably get loads more off the carcass but even I left feeling I'd done a reasonable job. Each choice comes with fries, salad and a garlic butter sauce..... Both sufficient, I don't think you go here to comment on the sides.The place has a cool vibe and is pretty open with lots of seating without being on top of each other. The drinks menu is good with a decent wine selection and I didn't think the prices were too bad.The staff seem to enjoy being there and were friendly and accommodating, I got the idea they may struggle if the place was busy... But it wasn't so I can't be sure.Anyone that comes to London and in need of a \"safe bet\" should put this place high on the list.",

They don't queue. They're very surburban.Anyways the friendly wait staff explained and took our orders. My brother ordered a pineapple cocktail which was really tasty, and I had a glass of prosecco, on a wednesday. I know, how naughty! I wasn't even celebrating! We ordered 3 steamed lobsters and 1 grilled, with garlic butter which apparently, is the sauce of gods, because we ordered another garlic butter on top of what we ordered. (roll us out why don't you!) The lobster was steamed perfectly on mine, my mum's was a tad overdone but by a minute or so, it wasn't obvious.

    "text": "Damn. Burger & Lobster is stunning. From being seated to leaving I was left delighted.As you're seated, the waiters helpfully explain how the process works. It's a simple process. You choose either Lobster, Lobster/Roll or Beef Burger. If you're here for the beef burger, just leave. This isn't the place for you. For the others, you can choose from steamed or grilled lobster. Apparently steamed in nicer, whereas grilled is sometimes dry and burned hindering the flavour. I opted for the steamed lobster with garlic butter sauce. OH MY.The crab claw meat once plucked out of the claw using the lobster tools (no idea the proper name for these) then dipped in the garlic butter is truly divine. I've had many types of crab, lobster burger, crawfish (errgh) but never a whole lobster before. It's just out of this world in terms of the delicate white meat flavour against the salted garlic. Served with Salad and really nice crispy fries for \u00a320, it's almost unbelievable. Sure these aren't the biggest lobsters you'll ever set eyes on, but when you add in the location, service, decor etc...it's superb value. B&L is a real showcase for how the right process and simplicity of menu can reap dividends. The desserts were baked cheesecake topped with oreos or Eton mess. They were nice, served in paper cups like we'd ordered a takeaway dessert from a cookie company, or similar to Snog dessert shop. No complaints though, if this is what it takes to deliver me a \u00a320 lobster, I'm game..In all, I loved the experience. The staff were unpretentious despite the look and decor of the venue, and it's as casual as you can get. Booking is difficult, and luckily the Bread Street branch allow reservations for a party of up to 8. The downside is that they only have one of these \"large\" reservations available at each timeslot, so expect to book a table at least 2 weeks in advance if you want dinner at one of the peak dining times, e.g. 7pm.Shall be back.",

Add an hour wait on top of that and it makes it an even slippier slope, but damn this place makes me happy.I've never been to this location before. I was crossing my fingers that it wouldn't be as busy as its' Soho counterpart, but I was wrong. I was quoted over an hour wait, so my friends and I decided to head to the pub while we waited to be called. I'm pretty sure it was about an hour when they called us back and we got a nice table in the front. We ordered more cocktails and decided which one of the three things we wanted to order. This was my fourth time at B&L, and I've never had a lobster roll all to myself so I decided that the lobster roll would be on my dinner itinerary this night. What I really like about B&L is that they really have the concept of turnover time down. I mean, you wait an hour to get seated, but the food comes out pretty fast. I say within ten minutes you've got your giant platter in front of you. If you wanted to, you could literally be in and out within 30 minutes (from the time you get seated to the time you've fully engulfed your burger/lobster/lobster roll because you've been STARVING after having to wait for an hour to get seated). You may think that \u00a320 is a lot to ask for, but let me suggest that you should bring two friends and try everything. B&L is even nice enough to cut it in thirds for you. Oh yeah, did you also know that the fries and salad are also unlimited? It's not something they outwardly advertise, but now that you're in the know, might as well take advantage and get your \u00a320 worth.",

I think they do a fine lobster, it's always well cooked and broken into manageable bits which I really appreciate. If you're feeling lobster then Burger and Lobster is easily four stars. I just wasn't craving lobsters when my cohort opted to go. I got a grilled lobster and a lobster roll to share - I'm greedy like that. The lobster was delicious as always, the sauce was creamy, salad well seasoned and tasty - for a salad! The chips didn't really impress on this occasion, but they served the purpose of scooping up the sauce. The lobster roll is delicious, just the right amount of mayo in the lobster, a perfectly toasted brioche - it didn't come with a butter dip though! I'm not sure if they've just stopped doing it altogether, but I asked for a butter dip and it was brought forth swiftly.Downsides - there just wasn't enough sauce with the lobster. The pot was less than a third full which was disappointing, I wasn't looking to drown a whole lobster in it, just wanted a bit more sauce is all! As above, the chips weren't great.If you're craving lobster, I can't think of many places that outdo Burger and Lobster for satisfaction and ease of access, the drinks here are solid too. More sauce and better chips would definitely make me a more frequent visitor.",

    "text": "Like I said in my tip its the lobster not the burger you need to try. This is a newer branch to the more popular farringdon branch. Hence why you really see people who work in offices and business around the area winning and dinning or you see those that were unable to get a seat without booking at the farringdon branch dinning here. Regardless of the type of people here what you will find us a less busy quieter branch for the time being at least. Now I've never had a lobster before and I know what a beef burger is about even with or without the bacon slices to add. My seafood experience is limited to salmon and prawns, but boy, when I tried that HUGE grilled lobster it was very much like eating a meaty piece of prawn that you can really sink your teeth into. The claws and shells are a part if the added fun when searching for the remaining pieces of lobster on your plate. I very much enjoyed the pick-fork they gave to hammer down on those difficult shells for my hidden treasures of meat. The accompaniment of chips and salad were good and substantial but nothing really to write home about, but like I said its the lobster you need to be eating here. When my colleges were finished with there burgers they just sat there looking at me enjoying my lobster searching through the shells for more juicy succulent lobster meat, which I was enjoying immensely. The next time I go I am definitely trying a whole lobster to myself as I belief I can do it, I can finish it, I can devour the whole lobster plus my sides of salad and fries.",

I mean seriously the menu isn't that extensive...either a burger, a lobster, or a lobster roll. Anyway after waiting for my friends to come (they were late) we finally got seated. We ordered our beverages...I ordered some grapefruit drink. Not really sure what it was called but it was good and non-alcoholic. Now for the food we all ordered the Lobster...I ordered it steamed with garlic butter? and lemon wedges. I realized I only needed the lemon.The lobster came out quite quickly and it was SOOO GOOD. The little salad on the side was also pretty delicious. All in all great meal...and it was what? \u00a320? + drink...I WILL GO BACK...if I have time...",

It is also relatively close (20 min walk) from London Tower.The main downside is that all entrees are \u00a320 each, and they greatly incentivise \"one dish per person.\" Prepare your wallets.",

I turned up at the City branch around 6:30 and there were plenty of tables but these began to fill up in no time. I had a drink at the bar while I waited for the rest of my party arrive but luckily we were seated within 10 minutes. The staff there were super friendly and attentive. I ordered the grilled lobster with garlic butter and whilst it was very tasty, I felt the chargrilling left a slightly bitter taste \u00a0which overpowered the sweetness of the meat. Despite this I'd definitely be up for visiting again to try either the steamed lobster or lobster roll. For \u00a320 I think this is great value for a whole lobster although for a burger I'm not so convinced. Overall Burger & Lobster a simple concept done well and is a must for seafood lovers.",

    "text": "I can't believe it has taken me this long to make it to a Burger and Lobster, though to be fair, I have tried before and just had difficulty getting in when the wait is always so long. Luckily, this time I had plenty of time to kill and waited the requisite 90 minutes for my table, at a nearby pub. The experience of B&L, at first glance, is kind of cheesy. It feels like they're trying to fake a crab shack feel, with the traps on the walls and the exposed light bulbs. Upon deeper examination, it's actually a well designed atmosphere, playful yet classy, and probably the first time \"American style\" hasn't made me cringe to be associated with it. The food and drinks come out quick here; the drinks also have a particular strength which makes them very enjoyable. I tried two cocktails, the Tom Weller, or something like that, as well as another. I was also hard pressed to not have the Flying Dog Snake Dog IPA which they have on the menu. Any place savvy enough to stock that is good in my book. The food itself was wonderful, so far the best burger I've had in London. The lobster next to me, and the lobster roll across the table, both looked delicious, but I was sold from the word bacon, and never looked back. Crispy, streaky, amazing bacon. Put that on top of a juicy burger with cheddar cheese and the necessary condiments, and I gladly found myself up to the wrists in a whole lotta goodness. The best burgers to me are the ones you can't put down; once you're in, you're committed. The service was nice, the company good. I was truly overfilled and had an amazing meal. The wait, in all senses of the word, was worth it.",

Lobsters for \u00a320 is decent deal, but for the burger or lobster roll? (The lobster rolls were also pretty small in my opinion, my cousin inhaled his in under 10 minutes).

    "text": "Hmmm, I wonder what Burger & Lobster sell? This is a place that has really decided to follow the phrase \"It's all in the name\". The menu is so simple, that there isn't one. You quite simply can order a burger (with optional bacon and cheese), a 1 1/2 lb lobster (either grilled or steamed), and a lobster roll - all for \u00a320.Pretty much everyone I know goes for the lobster or lobster roll, so it was pretty tempting but as I'm on a BurgerQuest, it was always going to be the burger. For \u00a320, you expect to be wowed with a burger or at the very least understand what is supporting the price. Sadly, B&L's burger doesn't quite do that. Don't get me wrong, it's a delicious burger but not worth the price tag. It's a sizeable beast on a soft white bun sandwiching tender juicy meat. The bacon was a great addition with its salty and smoky flavours but I would have preferred \u00a0sharper cheddar as the cheese got a bit lost in the mix. You do get unlimited chips and salad (which isn't something they advertise) but whether or not you want them is another question. The chips are perfectly adequate but again they don't really knock your socks off. The salad is great with parmesan cheese and mini croutons so fill your boots with that.Drinks wise, there is decent wine list and some interesting cocktails. I would warn the cocktails are a bit expensive at around \u00a39-10 and fairly light. Wines will run you around \u00a36/glass.Ah, and of course, getting a table. Now the Shoreditch and City locations will let your reserve but the Soho and Mayfair ones typically are walk in only. If you can, reserve a table as otherwise the wait can be anywhere from 20 minutes to 1.5 hours, even on a Tuesday evening. Overall, a good effort at the burger, B&L, but I'm not sure why you need it to be so expensive. Surely you can knock it down to \u00a315 without too much of an issue?",

So, we decided to stop by and give it a try. I mean, who doesn't love burgers and lobster? As soon as we walked in, we could kind of tell it was a little more upscale than we were expecting. However, we were seated right away at a big, comfy booth. The atmosphere of the restaurant was great and our server was really nice. When we opened the menu, we were definitely not expecting the prices... 25 pounds for a lobster roll?! But my friend had heard great things about the restaurant and we all decided it was okay to splurge for some seafood. We all got a lobster roll, except for one of my friends who got a burger. The lobster rolls come with fries, a small side salad, and seasoned melted butter. Everything was DELICIOUS. The lobster roll was definitely the star of the show - it was perfection! The lobster was amazing, especially with the melted butter drizzled over it. And even the roll part was to die for. I don't know what type of bread they use, but we all literally ate every last bite. Those lobster rolls totally left us wanting more. I had to hold myself back from literally stuffing the whole thing into my mouth. My one friend also really enjoyed his burger... Anyways, I'd say besides the price range, this place was awesome. I'd DEFINITELY recommend the lobster rolls to any seafood fans.",

Ample lobster and the roll was toasted perfectly. The garlic butter was a nice addition. Fries were perfectly cooked and even the salad was pretty yummy. A great choice for my late lunch/early dinner.",

The waiters were energetic and the music was awesome, I even asked what playlist they had on!",

We had the grilled lobster which came with the best crispy fries and a side salad dressed in a vinaigrette. We could not fault a thing! Our waiter was kind to explain the difference between grilled and boiled lobster and then later he saw me struggling with the claws and explained the best way to crack it open :) The lobster tasted amazing and such value for money. I couldn't get enough of the garlic butter sauce. We also ordered a sharing cocktail which was served in a humongous glass... We had quite a few people starring at us at this point, thinking that one of us would down it!I made a reservation via email for my husbands birthday celebration and the customer service was great. I could bring my own celebration cake or they would give a dessert for free! (However at the time of dining, I had forgotten all about the dessert) The atmosphere was great as all the tables were pretty much taken and I loved seeing people being served their dishes. It was my first visit, but definitely not my last!",

I thought the steamed pounder lobster was a nice lunch size that didn't leave you hungry or in food-coma. The butter sauce was a bit too strong for my taste though.They did a great job though of cracking open the lobster so there is minimal work here to scoop out the meat.",

    "text": "Lobster rolls are a big deal in my part of the world. After living for years in a barren wasteland, the Great Lobster Roll Invasion of 2012 brought Cousins Maine Lobster, the Lobsta Truck, and other options to our neck of the woods. I quickly determined the best offerings & options, and took it as a given that this was the top of the tank in terms of quality.Flash forward to the present: I had just finished my latest museum excursion in London, and a quick search on Yelp told me that Burger & Lobster was in the vicinity. My wife had specifically singled out this establishment as a place we should try, and normally I would wait for her (really), but my hunger prevailed and I got myself a table for a late lunch.I came here for one thing, and that is what I ordered: the Lobster roll with lemon garlic sauce. It is prepared differently than what I've had in the States, and I was just a wee bit skeptical at first. However, I can now say with confidence that this is the best I've had, and the fries aren't too shabby, either. Just don't look at the bill too closely.",

Have had both the burger and the lobster roll, highly recommend the latter. The toasted roll and side of melted butter are perfect, comes with a side of crispy fries and a small salad for a balance of yum and food groups. Have to give a hat tip to the service as everyone is friendly and super on top of things.",

If you are feeling particularly indulgent - or just ravenous - you can sample half of each plus dessert for 30 quid. As this was a work lunch, I chose not to give into an afternoon food coma and went with the lobster roll. It was served with a small salad, homemade chips, and garlic butter. The lobster meat was plump and very well seasoned with a good mayo and salt balance. The brioche was a tad on the heavier side, however, because it is toasted with butter almost to a fried texture. I had some of the lobster meat by itself to avoid the heaviness. Service is rather slow - it took about 15 minutes just to get our order in.",
