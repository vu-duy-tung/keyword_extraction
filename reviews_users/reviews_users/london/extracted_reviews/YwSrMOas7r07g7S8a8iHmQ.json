    "text": "Jen Caf\u00e9 is a family business. When i went there i only saw women working! If you pass in front of the cafe you will surely see through the window a woman making the dumplings. So yes it's hand made, so yes when it's in your plate fried or steamed it's yummy good. But the place is small, busy and noisy, so you better eat up your yummy hand made dumplings quickly because you don't want to stay there for long.What's not to be missed : the dumplings of course ! if you like them steamed then the bejing dumplings are made for you! the tea is not bad, but i would say that they are tea specialist as they claim.Money, money, money : it's overall very cheap. It's one of the main reason people go there when they pass in front the shop. They see the woman making the dumplings, they look at the prices, and then they enter. That usually how it works. Count around \u00a35 for 8 dumplings, \u00a33.50 for a bubble tea, \u00a35-6 for a large bowl of noodles.That little thing : i would say the home made dumplings. And maybe also the special lunch menu where you get noodles AND rice and a drink for \u00a36.50. Just watch the wall, it changes daily.What needs to be work on : The list is pretty long, first maybe the place, it's quite small and it gets crowded very quickly. Plus the seating are not cosy at all. The place is not clean, the tables sticky from the previous meal, and the floor very dirty.Verdict : it's ideal if you want a quick cheap lunch and eat good dumplings, but if you seek for something else, just keep looking.",

    "text": "So happy when I found this place while searching online for a chinese restaurant that serves homemade dumplings!It's pretty much a hole in the wall in the middle of China town, however the food speaks louder than how this place looks. There's a little chinese lady \u00a0by the window relentlessly folding dumplings while tourists pass by to check out what she's doing. Dumplings both steamed and fried are delicious!! It tastes just like the dumplings I have back in Cali. The chinese style jja jja mein (black bean sauce with homemade noodles) are a little less than average. The fried bbq pork is amazing! Very juicy but crispy on the outside. Anyways, its cash only so remember to stop by the cash machine before you make your way in. =)",

The tea itself was good, but the bubbles were hard and slimy. Mission half accomplished? My combination rice was only so-so and my friend said her vegetable dumplings were also just average. Service was quick and friendly. It gets fairly crowded at lunch time. There are definitely better places in Chinatown, but it's not bad for a quick, authentic Chinese meal. Next time, if there is a next time, I'll order the meat dumplings and tea sans bubbles.",

    "text": "Having recently recommended Jen Cafe for bubble tea, I felt duty-bound to return to check whether it was as good as I remembered.Jen Cafe is very aptly named and is a reminder of the hawker stall experience in Malaysia - small tables, people sharing, waitresses remembering your order without writing it down, general hubbub but somehow the right dish arrives at the right table.There's a good choice of regular drinks, ice drinks and bubble tea with pearls - tapioca based with sugar giving the chewy bullets at the bottom of the drink. I chose the melon and it was nice to see fresh fruit going into all the bubble drinks. My melon could have been a bit sweeter but that's not the fault of the cafe.I also had crispy pork with lo mein and an order of their signature Beijing dumplings. The dumplings were nice but not outstanding with the wrapper verging on being a little thick. The crispy pork was nice.Worth a look for a quick meal or for some takeaway bubble tea.",

    "text": "Jen Caf\u00e9 is a Chinatown institution and has been on its corner site on Newport Place for as long as I can remember. It's very much a caff reminiscent of the cha chaan tengs of Hong Kong serving a wide choice of hot drinks and breakfast stuff like toasted sandwiches. Whilst the bulk of the menu consists of Cantonese BBQ served with a choice of rice and noodles, there's only one reason why you come here and that's for their hand-made jiaozi or Beijing dumplings. These dumplings remind me of Beijing and you know they're hand-made as you can see the ladies making them in the shop window. I ordered the jianjiao or fried dumplings (\u00a35/8 pcs) but you can also order boiled dumplings (\u00a34.50/8 pcs). There was a bewildering choice of drinks but being a bit of an old git, I ordered a tankard of hot chrysanthemum tea (\u00a31.20). The dumplings were perfectly pan-fried with a nice char on the outside. As these are Northern Chinese dumplings, they're more rustic than Cantonese dim sum but what they lack in delicacy they make up for in taste. The filling of pork, spring onion, chives, and Chinese leaf was juicy and was complemented well by the traditional vinegar dip. All in all, Jen's handmade dumplings make for a great snack or to share as a side order with a one-plate meal.",

The noodle dishes are also pretty nice and again, ridiculously cheap.

    "text": "hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026  Even though I must have walked past Jen Cafe a million times and was always more than intrigued by the Chinese lady sitting in the window of this small Chinese eatery making dumplings, it needed the heartfelt recommendation of Eat Noodles Love Noodles (read his review of Jen Cafe here) to finally convince me to give it a try. Entering Jen Cafe on the corner of Chinatown, I felt like I had left London and ended up somewhere in China. Half of the waitresses don't even speak English. You wouldn't exactly call Jen Cafe stylish with its metal floor and furniture that has seen its best times (which were not very good even then) probably 30 years ago. I had not even finished placing my order when the food was already in front of me. This was just as well as Jen Cafe doesn't invite to linger. I just had to try the home-made Beijing Dumplings (5) and I did not regret this choice. The generous portion of steamed dumplings with meat-based filling was very tasty indeed. In fact they tasted far better than they looked Even though the dumplings would have been probably plenty for my lunch, my culinary curiosity made me order also the Pork and Pickled Cabbage with Noodles (5) from the board of specials. This soup was rather insipid and I got the confirmation that not even Chinese spices can turn cabbage into something interesting. Jen Cafe gets additional points for entertainment. Half way through my meal one of the waitresses wordlessly put loads of food I had not ordered on my table. Intrigued I watched as she brought shredded chicken, vegetables and burritos and finally takes the seat opposite me (I should mention that my table was small and the restaurant was not full). Still without a word she started rolling herself a burrito and heartily eating it completely ignoring my presence. I decided to quickly leave, somehow I didn't feel very welcome Jen Cafe is not the best place I have ever eaten at but it's fun, cheap and definitely worth a visit to enjoy home-made dumplings. I would recommend though not to choose the table the closest to the counter, she is not going to share her burritos with you!",

    "text": "Jen Cafe is one of a few reasons I would ever go into Chinatown for chinese food. Firstly it is definitely a cafe, not fancy at all and service is very rushed and definitely do not expect manners as for most chinatown restaurants. It is like a chinese greasy spoons without the warm smile not even for a regular.But it is one of the places in London where I can forgive the restaurant for bad service as it is part of the experience if you're planning to eat in Chinatown in the first place.The cafe itself is very small, cheap metal tables and seats, plastic cutlery and plates, bright green walls and an 'out of service' sign always stuck on their toilet which makes it all very unwelcoming. But I like it and especially when they make the most fresh and delicious Beijing dumplings in London. And you should only come here for their dumplings and their popular variations of Bubble tea. Only use the other items on the menu as a stomach filler for the more hungry ones as the quality would not match the dumplings at all.You can tell it's fresh from the lady sitting facing the window making the dumplings in front of you as you walk by and there is a choice of either pork or vegetarian and then boiled or pan fried. I always go for the pork just because it is more fragrant and then a portion of it being pan-fried for \u00a36.00 and a portion of boiled for \u00a35.00. They are like no other Beijing dumplings anywhere else in London. First of all they are made from glutinous rice flour rather than all-purpose or plain flour. This provides a more lighter and softer pastry, more sticky which makes the dumplings more moist, making it a delight to eat. The filling is perfectly seasoned and flavoured well with chives and other ingredients. Flavours are definitely not lacking here.Whether it is pan fried or boiled both varieties comes to you piping hot. Even though I always order both varieties I always preferred the boiled ones as it's a fresher, cleaner taste, more squidgy and holds more of the pork stock inside. However I know many prefer the pan-fried just for that smokey flavour and crispy base. Once it's left on your table it's to your customisation with the condiments on your table and the platelets given. The usual mix tends to be a spoonful of vinegar and half of that in soy sauce and then chilli oil to your preferred spice level. Of course you can keep adding each to get the flavour you want.As a stomach filler I would recommend the noodle soup dishes to the rice dishes as I find their meat over rice a bit too greasy with fatty and poor in quality meat. I always go for their special which is shredded pork and pickled cabbage with rice noodles and make sure you ask for rice noodles or they will give you instant noodles instead. So the noodles aren't the best quality, a bit plasticky but for the price of \u00a35.50 I'm not complaining because it is the pork and pickled cabbage that flavours the broth making it very appetising and warming to the soul with the meaty, savoury and sour taste. You can always spice it up with the chilli oil on your table too.Depending on what time you go it is always quite packed and yes service is very rushed and they will throw the bill at you straight after you finish your last bite so a bit of warning there. But with that in mind and a bit of openness you will find yourself having a very nice delicious, quick yet filling meal there. Definitely not a place for a romantic meal but for good quality, authentic Beijing dumplings.",

Well, they make up for everything. It's wonderful watching people make dumplings from scratch in the window, and when you taste them, they're even better. I actually think everything pork-based from this place is amazing-- at least, I have yet to try something I disliked. Wonderful assortment of teas, as well. The price is, of course, the real winner- you always leave feeling full and satisfied!",

    "text": "Chinese canteen style. Squished against strangers. A simple look, even if slightly abrasive. \u00a0But I love that part of the experience.Jen's Cafe, I believe, serves Beijing style food. You can usually see one of the few ladies who work there, rolling out and making fresh dumplings in the window. Arguably, this is what they are best known for. The vinegar and chilli oil are out and ready for your bundles of joy to be dunked in and savoured.I often like a lighter dumpling and will order a bowl of steamed vegetarian Beijing dumplings. While enjoying them, I watched the fried dumplings go past. They're not the deep-fried within an inch of their lives like some places do it. Put lightly pan fried on one side, sharing the duality of chewy and crunching in one bite.Oh, I had made a big mistake.Recently, not intending to let them pass me by again, I ordered (and shared!) both steamed and fried dumplings. Good choice Jhenn. Good choice. I was also pleased to learn their vegetable soup option is vegetarian (no homemade noodles though). Although lacking in flavour, it was nothing the stacked-high condiments couldn't fix (helllooooooo chunky chilli oil!)Overall, I really like Jen's Cafe and love to take people there to share a plate of dumplings.",

I placed my order, and the woman behind the counter invited me to take a seat while they prepared my mango bubble tea. \u00a0I peered around and found the caf\u00e9's decor to be spartan and a bit tatty. \u00a0But, hey, it's cheap-and-cheerful Chinatown, right?Ultimately what the score comes down to is this: the bubble tea itself. \u00a0It was blended with ice, which I wasn't expecting but wouldn't be, all things considered, a deal breaker. \u00a0Nevertheless, the ice hadn't been completely broken down in the blending process, which resulted in a, well, rather icey consistency - not at all appealing, especially not with the cool, dismal weather going on outside at the time.Would I go back to try another bubble tea in future? \u00a0Possibly. I DO have a love that some people might call unnatural for drinks with jiggly balls in them.Was the one I got on that day 'A-okay'? \u00a0No. \u00a0Its only redeeming factor was the aforementioned jiggly balls, which would, indeed, make anything better; let's be honest here.",

They have other items as well but the dumplings, boiled, fried or souped are delicious and filling any way you like them! And the prices \u00a0(\u00a35) are right if you just want to fill up and not be ripped off by all the high priced restaurants in the area. The interior is small, tables are sometimes shared and they decor isn't anything special but you get what you pay for.

Overall we thought this was a good hearty meal that's comfort food for the two of us on our holiday that love Asian food. This is definitely a place for local Asians to dine at as well as some other London locals looking for cheap Chinese food.

You feel like you are dining in a similar place in the Far East. \u00a0The seating is quite tight and cosy since the place is small, so you are expected to share tables, which I do not find a problem with, as you are there to eat the food and leave, definitely not to linger. \u00a0As soon as seats are vacated it is quickly filled again, so a very buzzy feel to the place. \u00a0We shared a plate of 7 fried dumplings, and I ordered the fried fish balls and noodle soup and my friends had the beef noodle soup and BBQ pork with rice. \u00a0The duck and chicken was already finished even though it was only 6.30pm, but understandably, since they are famed for their dumplings, they are not really bothered to keep that in high stock. Oh my, I have not tasted fried fish balls with noodles so tasty for a long time! \u00a0It definitely evokes memories eating street food in the far east, the hor-fun noodles were so fresh and rather like pho in texture and taste. \u00a0An absolutely delicious bowl of yumminess!",

Both were amazing and just what I wanted in when I think of both - dumplings were fresh, the filling was flavorful and the duck was seasoned well and delicious and comforting. No frills. Someone next to me ordered fried dumplings and those too looked great. (BTW they seat others w you if there's space. This place wouldn't be great for a larger group; 10-15 tables max)You can catch the dumplings being made b/c everything happens right there!Go for the fast and delicious food.",

This restaurant lured us in with their excellent location and window display of workers rolling out dumplings. There was no taste to the food. The staff was super friendly but was nothing that we expected in the food. Noodles and dumpling skins were too thick unlike most of the better dumpling houses. The sauces missed the flavor target.

Being such a small place, it's cash only, and be prepared for it. In terms of what you order, it's dumplings all the way, order them fried, steamed or in soup, you can't go wrong in my opinion. As for the other items, I've never had any.Seating arrangement will seem a little strange to people, they will sit you at a table with other people if you're a smallish group (tables fit 4 so if you're a 3, you might get a random). It's not that new a thing, and very common in Asia quick eat places. In fact it's kinda like Wagamama without having the long tables. But you aren't here for a long meal, you're there to sit, eat some dumplings and head on to the rest of your day/evening. For me, it's a quick bite to eat before continuing with my real plans.",

    "text": "Looking at the other reviews of this place I notice that while most tell of the basic, cramped surroundings and somewhat terse service, no-one else seems to have thus far mentioned the 20 minute time limit if you only have drinks... Even while sharing a table with strangers who are tucking into plates of dumplings.Having already eaten a big meal less than half an hour ago, I just want to relax with some Chrysanthemum tea, which quickly arrived (sweetened) in a mug but is too hot to drink right away.Fiteen minutes later and it is just about cooled enough for me to start drinking - I'm not one of the many gifted with an asbestos mouth, unfortunately.As I'm nearing eviction, I might order something sweet as the \"dessert\" to my earlier meal; or I might see if they suddenly pour the remainder of my tea into a doggie bag and usher me out of the door... The waiter has been coming over and checking my progress every two or three minutes, having already presented me with the bill at the same time as my drink!No. I really couldn't eat anything more right now (the sugary tea took me to my limit) so I will make a dignified exit while I can - despite the fact that there are now several vacant spaces, should a sudden onrush of new customers occur.I must remember to starve myself before I go back there again, as I do want to try those freshly made dumplings everyone raves about. The lady in the window has been making them non-stop the whole time, and I can see her still at it from my vantage point where I'm perched on the little pagoda opposite as I finish writing this.To summarise, a reasonably priced mug - not a pot - of Chrysanthemum \"tea\" made from instant, sweetened granules (as opposed to the actual flowers) whilst made to feel slightly less relaxed than on a visit to the dentist!",

On the other hand; when in the hands of a local, knowledgeable guide it can really open your eyes for the hidden gems.Thus before we arrived at Jen Cafe we had a brief stop at one of the Chinese supermarkets and got pointed out quite a few hidden spots for future reference.The dumplings we had at Jen's weren't bad or anything but the dough was imho to thick and made what I consider a meal in the lighter end of the spectrum a quite heavy experience. The filling and taste was great, but the consistence didn't do the trick for me - unfortunately. ===Disclaimer; this was a stop on a SoHo food safari-thing, so the review may seem rather slim but we only had a few items.",

Normally I see this place packed whenever I walk by but this time it was practically empty. Nevertheless we were still rushed a bit with the bill as soon as we had finished our meal. After reading Wendy L's review apparently this is normal. But don't let that stop you from coming here as the meal is worth it. I ordered the Honey BBQ pork with rice and a mint milk tea. For the price I was happy with the portion, a lot of meat and a good amount of rice to go with it! The pork was delicious but the rice was dry and crunchy in some areas. My boyfriend had better luck with his rice dish; three delicious meats and well cooked rice. Perhaps mine was just a fluke.Our drinks were very tasty. The tapioca pearls are fantastic! Extremely soft and perfectly sweet, out of all the pearls I've tried in London these are the closet in texture and taste to the ones I had in Taiwan. But we only got a few of them in our milk tea, I would have liked a lot more since they were so delicious! The fact that they have mint as a flavour of milk tea is awesome because I love mint and I love trying \"unique\" flavour options. Cheap, satisfying, good bubble tea. I can't wait to come back.",

You can add extra soya sauce if needed. My friend ordered the hot and spicy pork noodles with sauce. The noodles looked homemade and were quite thick like udon noodles. We saw the table next to us having it so we ordered one ourselves, and it was simple but \u00a0quite tasty.We also shared a bowl of wanton soup. I think they use the same soup base for the noodles and dumplings as they taste the same.We were too full to try their dumplings which are supposed to be pretty good, and you can also watch them making them by the window.The food here is simple, tasty and cheap, and I would probably pop back in again soon.",
