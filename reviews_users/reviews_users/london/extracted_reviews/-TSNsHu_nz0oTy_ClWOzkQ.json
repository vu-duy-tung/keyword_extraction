It's a sit down, but your tapas style food comes pretty quick. I've tried about 5 or 6 items on their menu and they are all pretty good -- but my favorites are the chicken taquitos & pork pibil tacos.Their food is a good balance of healthy & delicious. It's also pretty fast. Price point is good as well. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is due to the lack of consistency. Sometimes my taquitos will be drowned in lettuce, others times there is too little. The pork tacos can be a bi dry sometimes while dripping wet others. They also forgot to add the toppings on my tacos once. The horchata has been amazing at times, while lackluster at others.Minus the inconsistency, this place is nearly perfect at what it does.",

Drinks here are great, and the margaritas are fantastic - my favorite is the tamarind. Guac is very tasty - not fresh, as I watched them pull it out of big bags. Food-wise, it seems like their smaller plates are better. I've had the small fish tacos and the larger meal-sized portion, and the latter was very mediocre and very disappointing. Smaller haddock tacos are quite tasty. Service is not great at all, and I've had friends wait an upwards of thirty minutes at the bar for a drink, while others were getting their drinks much more quickly. Go for an inexpensive, good Mexican meal and great drinks.",

Her boyfriend ordered some of the tiny tacos.After waiting a little while, the pork scratchers came. She devoured them. They looked pretty good but I was waiting for my burrito. Coming from SoCal, I guess I'm pretty biased when it comes to Mexican food because I can get great Mexican food for dirt cheap prices back at home. When our burritos came, we all devoured the food so quickly. The food was decent nothing to rave about but nevertheless I'd go back again. Decent service decent food. A-OK in my book.",

    "text": "After various attempts trying to get into Wahacas across London (2 hour wait on a Wednesday at the South bank location - meh?!), I made it in here with I think a 40 minute wait. In this location there is a large bar upstairs which is ideal for a delicious mocktail (I'm big into mocktails, although this one was mostly ice) and some guac and chips. The guacamole I thought was excellent - fresh and punchy flavour and a well-balanced texture.We ordered the Wahaca selection which is ideal if you're lazy/indecisive/too busy gossiping to figure anything else out. What was even more ideal was that they appeared to accidentally double up at least 3 of the dishes, so we had an obscene amount of food. Overall I thought the quality was quite good - lots of nice flavours and well presented too.Service was generally pretty bad, both bar and restaurant staff seemed to forget about us. However, food was served quickly so I was basically happy.I had to check Wahaca's website to check the name of the Wahaca selection and was confronted by loads of irritating graphics and noises that took ages to load (and in fact didn't load at all on Chrome thanks to Google not providing an updated version for my old mac) and then eventually just led me to my ultimate bug bear, the pdf menu. PLEASE restaurants, stop having such awful websites. I don't have time for your shenanigans.",

When confronted with a 30 to 40 minute wait for a table on a Saturday evening, Vicky L and myself elected to skip the queues and eat under the heat lamps on the seats outside. It's late November but actually pretty comfortable outside. After a 15 minute wait, no drinks menu or server came to take our order - despite my frantic and deeply uncool gesturing through the window. \u00a0Wahaca - why bother with tables outside if you aren't willing to serve the people seated at them? Unable to wait anymore (...if the mountain will not come to Muhammed), Vicky L goes inside to give our order. Suddenly they can accommodate us inside - aka the waitress couldn't face the thought of having to add outside to her serving patch. Actually once seated we can see there are quite a few spare tables inside to boot - definitely not the 40 minute wait estimated. \u00a0Anyway the service continued to be inattentive, however lucky for Wahaca the food is pretty darn yummy for a chain. Food highlight of the night was the plantain tacos with feta, but the mushroom and cheese quesadilla was a complete treat. Vicky L and I were accidentally served each other's very different cocktail drinks but failed to notice for an hour - because they were so good. Also as the drinks are good, we decided the spacious cocktail bar upstairs might be the perfect little first date place.",

Our server was extremely unfriendly as well. (Maybe she needed one of their own margaritas?)

    "text": "Wahaca is a bit strange. Being from LA, I'm well versed in how amazing authentic Mexican food can be. I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to Mexican, and I don't like the fake stuff. I wouldn't call Wahaca authentic, but somehow I like it. I guess because I can't get Mexican like I can at home, so this is the next best thing. I dunno. What I love about the cuisine is how simple and no fuss it is, but just so damn good. Wahaca tries to jazz things up with sauces and combinations that most mexican places don't use. That normally annoys me, but I'm going against my better judgement here and just going with it. What I can recommend are the chicken tacos, potato chorizo quesadillas, sweet potato and guacamole (overpriced, but good nonetheless - perhaps the only thing that I had that I would consider authentic). The quesadillas are weird - I've never in my life seen a potato and chorizo quesadilla before in any Mexican restaurant, but the flavor is there and I like it, so I'm not gonna question it. The restaurants seem to be quite trendy at the moment and get really busy around dinner time, so come early if you don't want to wait for a table. There is also a bar area where you can get margaritas and such while you wait, but I've not tried it, so I can't say anything about that. On a side note, I've had a burrito from the truck outside the restaurant along the Southbank and it was awful. The worst burrito I've ever had...so dry and flavorless and just no.",

My friend and I ordered chips and guac to share. Unfortunately, the chips were stale and the guac, while fresh and chunky, lacked flavor. It's saving grace were the chili sauces on the table--I especially liked the smoky habanero one. For main, I got a Mexican bowl with chicken and it was yummy! It was a small-normal sized portion but loaded with beans, salsa, pickled onions, guac, and more and left me quite satisfied!",

It's also a chain in London, so even more reason to set the standards low. My boyfriend and I shared the plantain and the steak tacos, salmon and crab tostadas and a chicken quesadilla from the street food menu. They were all quite delicious. Great flavours and just the right amount of food. Although, I don't think I will get the tostadas again. The toppings were great but it was basically on a stale tortilla chip. We had the churros for dessert and a hibiscus and a classic margarita which were both delicious. Save room for the churros.I would definitely come back here for some happy hour margs with the ladies as well as a yummy dinner. Also, service charge was not included so the service was better than average London.",

Each branch that opens has a slightly new take on the bright Mexican street food eatery selling healthy South American tapas and the best tequila in town, all at mega affordable prices.  I have never had a bad meal or a bad margherita at Wahaca. These guys know what they're doing. Whether it's a crunchy chicken ceaser tostada, a crispy sweet potato & feta taquito or a delicious pork pibl taco, the mini dishes are a dream. Load up and enjoy! The bigger dishes are great too, whether you're into fish tacos, burritos or a salad where you can literally eat the bowl, it's all great! Make sure you start off with THE best guacamole and chips, and end with the decadent churros with chocolate sauce to complete your Wahaca experience. And don't forget the tequila! This location had a tequila bar upstairs so you can relax of an evening with a range of margaritas and some chips and dips at your side! They also have a lunch area for take away burritos on your lunch break. Amazing. The restaurant area isn't quite as comfy and fun as other locations, but the food is still great.",

I can get tacos from a taco truck in Santa Ana for $1 (\u00a30.77 ) that taste better than what I tasted at this restaurant. We ordered food and every plate came out at random times. The mains came about 10 mins apart, so by the time I finished what I could eat, the other person still hadn't received their main dish. Here is what we ordered:1. Mexico City style chicken enchiladas - no flavor and totally not worth the \u00a39.95.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 ----came with nasty re-fried beans and overcooked and just awful rice2. Chorizo topped frijoles (\u00a34.50) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -----Chips tasted old and the beans were awful3. Pastor marinated grilled chicken (\u00a311.95) \u00a0 \u00a0---- This was the only edible thing in my opinion.  \u00a0 \u00a0-----The bed of rice included in the plate was also overcooked and tasted awful.The manager did comp 15% off the bill because the rice was indeed overcooked, but we didn't enjoy our meal here at all. Even with the comp we still paid around \u00a335 I believe. I really don't like leaving a restaurant feeling hungry and this is what I felt like after eating here. I do need to state that if this is all that London has to offer in terms of Mexican food then the people of London are being severely let down.",
