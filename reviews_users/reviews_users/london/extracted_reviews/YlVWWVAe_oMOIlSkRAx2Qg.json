Not sure if that is the usual for fish and chips places but I have no complaints. The food was hot, fresh and just plain good.Not fine dining by any means but truly delicious and when I am eating a fast lunch all I want is something that tastes good.",

The fish was very well cooked, perfect texture, and breading was crisp and light. The chips were perfect cooked, light and tasty. Price was very reasonable and well worth it. I will definitely be stopping in again! Definitely recommended!",

The last time I actually bought their fish and chips was in the summer of 1978 when I was studying at the Stanford university campus in England, which was nearest station served by trains that came out of Paddington station.Al I really remember is that the fishing trips are great, but you had to eat them while they were warm. \u00a0They wrapped them in the London Times, Lord have mercy on anybody and let them cool down so the grease sould coagulate.",

While I can't really testify to the main dish, I can say that this joint is simple, clean and has ample seating. \u00a0It's also ridiculously cheap. Vegetarian options are borderline laughable but not absent. \u00a0They have a vegetarian burger, which is one of the McCormick (I think) patties made out a bag of mixed frozen veggies and potato. \u00a0On a bun. \u00a0That's it. \u00a0They also do eggs, and of course there are peas and beans and chips. \u00a0If you're looking to take visitors for this quintessential meal at a culturally-appropriate venue, you're not going to have gourmet vegetarian food, and what they offer is really just fine. Plus, you can't be too mad about your patched together vegetarian dinner when the whole shebang costs \u00a33.20.I've taken two groups of visitors here and they were both big fans. \u00a0They said the fish tasted fresh and mild and the batter was crispy and tasty. \u00a0My mom said that the fish she had here was unquestionably way better than the Rock & Sole Plaice, which was probably three times as expensive.Service is friendly but venue-appropriate. \u00a0Go up to the counter to pay (and you can order up there straight away if you know what you want).",

Each time the food was hot, crispy, golden brown and delicious. Service is what you'd expect from a small-divey-order-at-the-counter-hole- in-the-wall fish joint and the prices are very reasonable.

The coolest thing about Micky's was that it was a neighborhood joint. It was a small, hole-in-the wall type joint with just a few tables. Locals came in and out in their jogging clothes. Kids were there with their friends. We sat in the corner and had our fried haddock and chips and talked about work and camping trips. The fish was a bit on the cool side (like its been sitting out for a while) but the chips were piping hot. The food was AOK (it may be blasphemous to say, but I like the fish and chips at...OMG... I can't remember the name of the restaurant we always go to for lunches back home... what the heck... anyway - the fish and chips there... oh and we had some good ones in the center of London at a place called the Red Lion a couple of years back) but the experience of eating at a neighborhood joint was fun!

He quickly changed them to diet when we corrected him. I started in on the fish, it was definitely cod. It lacked the flavour haddock has. My friend asked if we could have tartar sauce and the waiter brought one small dish for three people. The chips were perfect, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The table did have malt vinegar which is a plus. But this place did not live up to my other stops and this was supposed to be the best of London.",

Despite there being a few options around Paddington I decided that the best option at this time would be a traditional English fish and chip shop. Okay, I had had plenty of fish and chips in the various hotels that I had visited but I was really interested in seeing what their basic fish and chip shop was all about. As it turned out it wasn't bad, though it certainly wasn't like any of the fish and chip shops that I have experienced in Australia. Sure, they have takeaway, but not to the extent that that have at home. Rather it was more of a sit down restaurant that specialised in fish and chips. In the end it wasn't bad - not fantastic, but not bad either.",

    "text": "I literally just finished my food so I can offer a fresh review. I was pretty excited to eat here after reading the good reviews. As I walked in, the servers seemed a bit rude and rushed. I decided to sit down to eat.I ordered the Micky's fish platter. Although the menu says it includes peas and bread, I did not receive them with my food. After I asked, the server brought me the bread but not the peas. I know I could have asked again, but like I said, the servers seemed rude, and I really shouldn't have to ask twice for a part of my meal.As for the food, it was alright. Honestly, most of the food seemed frozen and the taste was unremarkable. I was just surprised because the reviews were so good. Overall, I probably wouldn't eat here again. If I did, I would iust stick to basic fish and chips.",

At 5 pounds for a small cod and chips, I was very impressed.The chips were ok, not the best, but thick and like proper chipshop chips should be. The fish was beautiful really flaky and delicious, my only criticising is I wish there was more fish and less batter.. But only a minor grumble...",

I will stop when in the area but I wouldn't \u00a0make a special trip it's not thattt good. The fish is usually served hot and tasty with not to much of a grease level and chips are also pretty good. One thing I hate are the plastic \u00a0portion packs of sauce. The service is fast and hassle free.",

    "text": "It took me a while to get to Micky's because it's located all the way out in Paddington... not very central. Due to the long ride there, my expectations got higher but I was quickly surprised by how grungy the place looks. It's actually more like a stall, where there's a bar to serve food and several little tables to eat. It's not the place to impress guests or to sit down for a while.But for the inexpensive price, the food was not that bad. You get a big piece of fish and it was delicious, but you don't much else. Tartar sauce is served in a little Heinz packet, which kinds of makes the food seem like fast-food fish. Quality fast-food fish. Just keep your expectations in check... this is something quick and easy so if you're in the area and want to get something fast but good, it would be fun to swing by.",

    "text": "The decor, as many other folks, is pretty plain. Solid colored walls, some paintings of fish, wooden tables that stand on their own and chairs you can sit in. Each table has salt and pepper (in different style shakers) and some vinegar. There's also a standup menu on each table as well. I should've looked at that first before ordering. There are dine-in specials. Being a bloke from California, I wasn't aware if that's par for the course.I got cod and chips. It was fried and oily, but not overwhelmingly oily. Kudos to the batter that they use to fry the fish (they use groundnut oil). It wasn't overly thick, making it possible to really get an overall similar temperature throughout the fish and fried part. The fish was also flakey and didn't have that \"old fish in the freezer\" taste, which is pretty common.Fish, while good, lacked seasoning. I had to add a little bit of salt. It's like it lacked any kind of fish flavor completely.The chips were also of a good temperature and not overly oily. The way they were fried, however, did not leave them to be very crispy. They definitely weren't soggy, but I always expect a delicate crunch to my chips/fries.Service was questionable. Man behind the counter was staring off into the corner of the building and didn't address me when I walked up to the register and said hello. It required a second hello for a response, but he still didn't look at me until I started getting out my money. Odd, that.",

The restaurant itself was really clean and the guys behind the counter was nice. I didn't quite understand the piece of bread with butter on it. It literally was just a piece of bread with butter on it and to me looked rather pathetic.",

It's a simple chippy and filled the bill as to \u00a0a place to grab some food. Fish was hot and served quickly, and seemed for the most part to be made to order. The specials were good and a decent amount of food for the price, the big platter coming with cod, scampi, whitebait, prawns and calamari along with chips and a drink for \u00a38. My friend wasn't impressed that when asking for an orange juice, he got a juicebox in return, but all in all I think we were satisfied. I think we'll still be on the hunt for a post sunday skate place to eat but this will do in a pinch.",
