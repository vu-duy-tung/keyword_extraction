Nobu Berkeley is very good but the most expensive being in the UK. The atmosphere here is very upscale with more formal service which you will not find in the USA locations. I do prefer this location over the London location. During the many time I have frequent this location I have been very satisfied with the food and service. If you plan to go here; do plan to spend upwards of five hundred dollars person for the high quality Japanese fish flown in daily.",

    "text": "I was once taken on a date here,which was great because I got to eat and drink my way through the menu without worrying about the cost, which was turning into a similar amount to my rent for the month. Nobu Berkeley Square is probably the best Nobu in London, in terms of atmosphere. Plus it has a kick-ass bar, which is every bit as sleek and sexy as you would imagine from a mega expensive restaurant in Mayfair. If you are heading here, don't even think about missing the bar, as it does some of the best cocktails in London. My favourite is the goji berry martini - a frothy creamy concoction of berry deliciousness. The Nobu mojito comes a near second. And look out for any cocktails which have sake in them, yummy.So the food, well we all have heard the reviews . It really is as good as the hype suggests. I'm not quite sure how a menu which is styled as a mix of Japanese and Peruvian actually works, but it does. Probably the most famous dish is the Black Cod. It is slightly sweet, ever so soft, and one of the best dishes that you can have in London.The food is expensive, but there are ways of keeping the cost down. Listen up - on the back page is a list of all-inclusive meals. For about \u00a318.00 you can get a large bowl of chicken or prawn in teriyaki sauce with rice, and this comes with miso soup. The other thing to do is just order sushi. It is completely filling, and only about \u00a36 or \u00a37.00 for an hand cut roll. I could be completely happy here just sitting at the counter, sipping on a glass of wine, and having two or three plates of sushi. This would cost about \u00a325.00, so it's not all bad news for us penniless types.",

However, unlike some other celeb haunts, this is a genuinely fantastic sushi restaurant that you simply have to visit.I went with a couple of friends and of course, we did make an extra effort with our attire and you never feel so bad if others see you wolfing down sushi as its healthy right? Anyhow, the food was so good that you can't help but gobble it all down - if you're not a fan of sushi they also serve some alternative fish dishes such as blackened cod which is possibly the best piece of fish I have ever tasted (and also the favourite of Lemar apparently). I had heard notorious things about this dish before I went and am so pleased I finally sampled it.The food is extremely well presented and I didn't find the staff at all pretentious. We were treated in exactly the same manner as every other customer and he whole experience was fantastic.However, you may need to hold back on your eating out for a couple of weeks so save the pennies for Nobu as it is on the more pricey side at around - my main course was around \u00a332 so I decided against an appetiser! Well worth a visit though for something special.",

We were here for lunch on Friday and had 5 pieces of Salmon sashimi with wasabi and soy sauce to start. It was great qualify fish. The main course dishes came at intervals after that, which worked quite well as if they had all arrived at the same time it would have been too hard to choose what to have first.I don't know exactly what we had as we let the clients choose, but first up was a mushroom based dish in a sauce, I couldn't say what else was in it but I've never enjoyed mushrooms on their own more. We also had lobster with asparagus, prawn with asparagus, pork belly and wagyu beef. All great but the pork belly was utter genius, melt in the mouth doesn't do it sufficient justice. I've had the black cod here before and that's the only other thing I remember coming close to the pork belly.Fuji apple crumble came with peanut in the crumble mix and with hazelnut ice cream. It was very good but I think my taste buds had already been over-excited by that point",

    "text": "Fortunately for my wallet, the only time that I have ever visited Nobu was on company expenses. This was also quite fortunate for my taste buds too as we were openly encouraged to order whatever we liked. This meant I was allowed to order their signature Black Cod, guilt free. It was phenomenal. Every flake fell away from the fish effortlessly and the taste was incredible.The rest of my party thoroughly enjoyed their meals too and whilst it would be fair to say that there is a great emphasis on fish here, the meal lovers and vegetarians were also well catered for. Special mention has to be made of Nobu's skilled presentation. Every dish that you order arrives as a work of art in itself and it's clear that the kitchen are trying very hard to impress.The downside of Nobu is the celebrity factor. A known haunt for famous faces, it often feels as though this restaurant is more concerned with status than food. While we ate it was hard not to notice a few celebrities being rushed through the dining room in to the private area at the back. If anything I felt this drew more attention to them than if they had just been walked through the restaurant like anyone else.For most people a visit to Nobu will be a one off and for a special occasion it's definitely worth it. However, the prices here make it difficult for us non-celeb types to really get to know the place and its celebrity status can detract from the food.",

Not accustomed to dining out on this scale I dialled Nobu's reservation desk with some trepidation and held for 35 minutes, only to be told that the first available table for 8 was 6 weeks away. On a Wednesday evening. For the 6:30pm seating (not exactly peak time for celeb spotting). O well. After announcing our arrival at the hotel-style reception desk we were guided into the ground floor bar by our elegant, if ever so serious hostess. The dimly-lit bar is something to behold. It is beautifully designed and sitting at the small table I couldn't help but feel like I'd made it. Silly I know. Although the service was unremarkable, the food was incredible. I would highly recommend the Wagyu Beef skewers and the King Crab Tempura. Our group had done its research and a few people at the table informed me that it was widely known that the Black Cod was the way to go. What ever you do, don't miss it!",

My 'martini' was more like lychee juice with a splash of vodka and I was thoroughly unimpressed by it.

And the real celebs know this, anyway, so you're going to find them at the Met branch and not the Berkeley one.

Which is even more bizarre, given that she was sitting at the table next to me a few nights prior to that when I was eating at China Tang... go figure.... not that she's a gourmet tastemaker but we do seem to like to eat the same things ;)",

Getting a table was really easy as well, and their organisation was superb. The place has nice decor, however the ambiance is not as relaxed as I'd like, but then, I don't think I'm their usual client with the usual demands. The staff were lovely, although everytime we thanked them for pouring our drinks into our glasses, they smiled faintly and sort of backed away as if they were trying to blend into the background.

Berkeley Street is absolutely gorgeous though and you really do get the Michelin Star experience from the red carpet at the entrance right down to the immaculate toilets! The service was a little slow but the food is so exquisite that it hardly even matters - the whole atmosphere of the restaurant is relaxed and casual and I think it's nice that the service gives you time to relax and chat in between courses rather than a stiff-backed silver service which often makes for tense dining. I tried a completely different selection of food this time and as much as I can recommend the same old favourites, (the black cod and the bento box most popularly) I thoroughly enjoyed my yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos, mixed oysters and ginger cheesecake.",

I'm a fan - and definitely over the other Nobus in London.Get a drink at the bar first then sit down and order sushi, but also order some of the hot entrees. The black miso cod is a must, and the sea bass is a nice add-on. Ask the waiter about fresh specials - the fish is all very fresh but they usually have specials which shouldn't be missed!Have fun here - I miss it!",

    "text": "Nobu is a place to be seen at - high heels, short dresses, expensive drinks and good sushi. Don't go in jeans and sneakers, you'll feel out of place. As for the food, we tried some of the sushi (the yellowtail was fantastic) and the tempura (eggplant was ok, shitake mushroom, not so much). It was a fancy version of a tempura at other Japanese restaurants. We also tried the set dinners - my husband enjoyed his teriyaki salmon while I opted for the chicken in wasabi pepper sauce, which I was told was spicy. But instead, it was rather bland, for my liking, and left me wishing that I had ordered either more of the yellowtail sushi or the salmon like my husband. For dessert, we had the chocolate fondant with green tea ice-cream. The cake was good, but I would have preferred normal vanilla ice-cream instead. As we were celebrating my birthday, the chef did do a personalized \"happy birthday\" in icing around the plate...Most others were eating the set tasting menu and perhaps that's the way to go. But at \u00a380-95 a person, it better be a super special dinner! All in all, it was a fun experience and I'd probably go back for more of the sushi...",

Except that the service was great, very polite waiter. The food was great too, I had very tasty artichoke salad and sushi with st jacques.

Yes, it is a bit silly since I always seem to order the SAME exact items, be it Nobu Tokyo, Nobu London, Nobu NY or Malibu.Anyways, we were extremely lucky that a friend who works for a somebody got \"nobodies\" like us a last minute coveted reservation on a Wednesday for a 9pm Saturday night meal. Whoo Hoo!We walk to the Berkeley Square location, hearing it was the newer location and near our hotel. I was surprised to see a velvet rope outside and inside, a rave-like atmosphere. Apparently, this is the place to get dressed up and go for the bar scene and dinner!Our hostess literally seated us within 5 minutes of checking in to a lovely spot near the front window. Let the games begin!I ordered my usual Creamy Spicy Rock Shrimp Tempura, I cannot share nor eat enough of this dish. M had the always crowd pleasing Yellow Sashimi with Jalapenos.. We tried a mushroom dish of several different varieties including truffles. It was a little expensive, maybe $20?? but DAMN, it was good.. so glad to have ordered it!We skipped on the Black Cod Miso, which I love, and ordered a few rolls aside from the other dishes. Everything was wonderful, as always. The only thing that got me was the crowd scene and bumping, grinding rave music.. That, my friends, I could not stand behind. I guess we have that at KOI in LA, now that i think of it. Anyways, be it special occasion or if you are a foodie looking to indulge in some damn good fish, go to NOBU!!! Yay!!",

    "text": "I had an Ex of mine take me here a few years after we broke up to make up for her dumping me. Does that make this Sympathy Dining? If so I want more, more, more! Any free meal is good but when it's at one of the most exclusive spots in town then it kind of makes up for all the heartbreak and stress... ok, now that I think about it, it doesn't at all. I should claim another free meal here.So what can I say? I never would have seen myself dining here at this darling of the celebs, but she was paying and I wasn't saying no. I felt out of place in my H&M shirt and backpack from work, especially when she showed in a Chanel coat with a new 300 quid haircut. Fortunately though, the celebs on surrounding tables - some lady from ITV who wouldn't eat fish, the cute one from All Saints and the marvellous Goran Ivanisevic - all were dressed dowdy enough for me to fit in. Huzzah. I'm, a celeb... get me into here!The food is wonderful, and for the price it's five-star outstanding when someone else is buying. We leant mostly on the Peru-side of Nobu's life, getting the crab tacos and the ceviche salad, but we did venture East to the Japanese connections. My ex was a regular at the Met's Nobu and knew what to get and how it compared to the best raw fish from her own home in the land the rising sun. The Wagyu beef with truffles and mushrooms was a dish I could eat every day. Sounds expensive doesn't it? You'd be surprised that it's not all that bad.Moving Mr. Nobu to one side, the culinary highlight came from the subcontinent of all places, when the Indian pastry chef (Kotesh Kumar Khandala) pulled out 2 of the most complicated and sublime desserts I've ever tasted, full of fantastic flavours like green tea and adzuki. If you go to Nobu for one thing and one thing only, forget the black cod... it's the pudding you want.The only downside to a night at Nobu apart from having to consolidate your loans the next days, is that it is too much of a scene. The downstairs bar is choc-full of arrogant moneywinners in suits bleeding the country dry. It's a painful place to be and you kind of hope that they all order some mis-prepared Fugu. Invariably when people think of Nobu they think of ridiculous wealth and the world's best sushi - but don't - it's not all that exclusive and if anything the sushi is the weakest link, the other dishes are the real gems.",

Heres what we ordered:1. Hamachi Tartare - pretty good, loaded with wasabi and topped with caviar so beware if you don't like wasabi. 2. Salmon Tacos - MEH, it came with a \"spicy salsa\" which wasn't spicy... and the tacos were about the size of a pringle. -_-3. House Special Roll - Nothing out of the ordinary. Anyone can make this roll... just stuff salmon, tuna, and ebi into a roll and voila, you have Nobu's House Special Roll. 4. Uni - Fresh, worth the 18 pounds it cost? Not sure.5. Ikura - Equally fresh6. Toro - Amazing7. Hamachi - Don't even bother.8. Mackerel - YUM.9. Dessert - Chocolate Bento Box - EHHHHHHHH. Whatevs. HOWEVER, I ordered a glass of Billcart-Salmon Rose - this was the best glass of rose I've ever had. If you are a big champagne drinker, do not pass this up !Service was exceptional (after all this place has atleast 20 of them running around aimlessly)Even though my experience at this Nobu didnt meet my expectations, I'm still going to try the Los Angeles location but if I'm ever in London again, I doubt I'd come back.",

Unfortunately, we were early and had to chill in the lounge. This place was a meat market. Dudes in shirts unbuttoned to their navels looking like Tom Jones and ladies with their bits spilling all over. Wow. Dad, I think he's going he's going to pork her. He's not going to pork her, Russ. I think he's gonna. He may pork her. Thankfully, we were taken upstairs and had a great table. The food is fantastic and that is what I love here. The sushi is great here and we had the spicy tuna and California rolls. Solid. Rock shrimp with ponzu sauce, grilled octopus, and spicy shrimp ishiyaki. We get the rock shrimp every visit and you should too, it's one of the best things on the menu. Our other new choices were hits as well. The Uozo pie with the oatmeal cookie and dulce de leche ice cream was a nice ending. Service was good. Nobu is always a great meal. This scene was unlike anything I've seen and outdid the one in Vegas, if that gives you any idea. I love the food. But, could do without the club. This was also more expensive than Boxwood which is ridiculous.",

    "text": "Horrible. This place disappoints big time. I've been to the Nobu in NYC and while it's not stellar there either, this place is 10x worse. Hard rice sushi, doesn't taste fresh, mini sashimi taco shells are completely stale and overwhelms the fish. You take one bite and everything falls apart and onto your plate. Sigh. Menu is a little boring and not the most inventive. I wanted to order uni/sea urchin, didn't have it that night. I wanted to order the watercress salad, didn't have that either. =/If you're going to spend this much money on food and a sexy atmosphere, go to Hakkansan instead. I first went there when I was living in London years ago and I still prefer it over Nobu.",

Well that may be true, but it does great vegetarian food (at lunch service \u00a0at least) - best Donburi I ever had with squash and other seasonal vegetables and the tempura...I've had my fair share of battered veggies - but this was in a league of its own. Just thank god I wasn't paying!However it's not a drop in a dine place. Book online in advance is recommended for dinner, and the must-have 8PM table booking seems to be nigh-on-impossible. If anyone has a tip on how to get one of those slots, do let me know!",

And we got 2 out of the 3...The food/sushi:Crab Tacos- very small portion, but tastyTuna Tataki- melt in your mouth tunaHot chips & tuna- one of my favorite appetizers of the eveningLobster Tempura Entr\u00e9e- can't go wrong with fried lobster, but this was a bit overrated. \u00a0Not any better than any shrimp tempuras I've had and the lobster staring at us kind of freaked us out.Sushi: yellowtail roll, shrimp tempura, and eel. The shrimp tempura roll was the best among the 3, but all were good. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't really have any specialty rolls.The drinks were INCREDIBLE. My sherry cherry had egg white in it (LOVE that) and my friend oooh'd and aaah'd over her lynchee martini.Service: Our waiter was beyond patient with us as we took FOREVER to decide on what to order and quizzed him about celebrities he's seen at Nobu. He was extremely attractive too so made for good eye candy, although unfortunately for my single friend we were pretty sure he batted for the other side. Celebrities: No celebrities (besides us of course!) on that Sunday evening we happened to be at Nobu, but hottie waiter informed us that Brittney had just canceled a private party there for that week. He's also seen Naomi Campbell and Cristina Aguilera recently. However, he told us we'd have better luck seeing celebrities at their other location in London because that's where they tend to go.",

I guess I'm a traditionalist in this particular sushi sense.The cocktails, however, are *amazing.* \u00a0Don't come here without ordering one! \u00a0I'm especially partial to their version of mojitos... and I never even got into to that mojitos-are-all-the-rage craze. \u00a0Be warned though, *all* their fruity concoctions are deceptively strong... one mojito, two mojito... awww...why not a third? \u00a0And before you know it you are drunkety drunk drunk.I should note that I've never once been impressed by the service here... sometimes nice, sometimes snooty or indifferent... but *always* slooooowww. \u00a0And I find the music just a touch too loud for decent conversation.The lowdown? \u00a0If you have the money... you've probably already been here. \u00a0If not, you're probably contemplating it for a special occasion. \u00a0My take? \u00a0Unless you're really just looking for an ostentatious brand name restaurant, I'd go elsewhere... a place that's a little less clubby and where the impeccable service and food truly justify the extravagant prices.",

I have been to prettier restaurants and there certainly weren't any celebrities there that night. I was hoping the food would be out of this world, but it was like other places, there were a few things that were really good and most were just okay. It didn't feel like a special dining experience or a culinary journey. The Creamy Spicy Rock Shrimp Tempura started out tasting okay, but the serving was quite huge (it is not cheap so I suppose that's why) and the more of it you eat, the more ill you feel. It is okay only in small amounts, but 2 people trying to eat a mountain of it is just ruining the experience. It is just too creamy and too heavy.In general, Nobu had decent food, the tataki was good, but nothing to justify the price tag and it certainly wasn't exciting in terms of atmosphere.",

    "text": "I've heard the cuisine at Nobu described as 'new style' Japanese, but never truly understood what this meant until now. The food is in a class of it's own - absolutely phenomenal! The seafood and meats are of the highest quality, which alone makes the food stand out. Add to this perfectly balanced flavors and textures and it doesn't get any better. Dining at Nobu was a tasting experience that I'd best describe as 'blow your mind' good, which puts this meal on my 'best things I've eaten' list. Everything from food prep to service was also spot on. The quiet confidence of the sushi chefs along the counter expertly and precisely preparing each dish is an impressive sight. And the servers are also on their game, working together to quickly usher each order from the counter to the tables as soon as they are ready. We ordered a number of things to share and each dish arrived at our table with perfect timing. My only small nit about the restaurant was the dome shaped ceiling design that resulted in some strange acoustics where we were seated. We could clearly hear the conversation of a table on the other side of the room. We ended up sliding our table over a few inches which seemed to dull the effect a little.I can't wait for the next occasion when I return to Nobu (perhaps to check out another of their famous locations). Until then, I have the following sweet memories...Run down of the dishes we ordered:Japanese Julep Cocktail - Got things started at the bar downstairs with this refreshing twist on a traditional julep made with Yamazaki whisky. Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna - Fun presentation! Crunchy cubes of crispy rice on sticks that you dip in soy and add a scoop of spicy tuna before popping in your mouth. Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - My favorite dish of the night simply because the sashimi was unbelievably fresh, some of the freshest yellowtail I've ever eaten.Soft Shell Crab Roll - These crispy crabs didn't disappoint. Crunch, crunch, yum. Fresh Salmon Sashimi - Like butter. Need I say more?Shitake Anti Cucho Peruvian Style Skewer - Surprising transformation of a simple mushroom. They nailed the flavors on this one. New Style Wagu Sashimi - 2nd favorite dish of the night. Wagu melts in your mouth. Our friends ordered a different preparation of wagu sashimi, which was not as good. Definitely go for the 'new style' wagu! 'Dragon Eyes': Warm Chocolate and Zabayon Ganache served with Crema Catalana Ice Cream, Pistachio Garapinados and Mixed Berry Coulis - Ah, a happy ending Wine: Riesling 'Dachsfilet' D.Q Prinz Von Hessen \u00a02009 Rheingau, Germanya - Great pairing with our meal. So good, we ordered a second bottle.",

    "text": "There's one thing you just have to know going into Nobu: it's expensive as all get out. Regardless of how much it costs to actually construct the dish, it will cost you an arm and a leg. It's kind of like Vegas, you just have to resolve yourself to a \u00a0certain \"sunk\" cost when you step inside. When you've made your peace with that, then you can make some smart choices to get the most enjoyment out of the 401k you gave up to eat there.In terms of fish, I have to say that it's not the best, most flavorful, freshest fish I have ever tasted. Just like any other sushi joint, some days are better than others, and some cuts are better than others. Definitely ask what is best that day, because the sushi chefs will know. Remind yourself that you don't care about the price. The scallop has been very good, and of course you can rarely go wrong with Toro. Salmon is consistent but still not the best I've tasted.The wagyu beef traditional style with two sauces is delicious. Sometimes you just can't beat a REALLY good cut of beef.The hamachi and jalapeno starter is always a favorite of mine and Nobu does it to a standard almost worthy of the price.while miso glazed black cod isn't the most original of dishes anymore, it's still addictive, and just as flaky as you remember it the last time, every time. You will most likely never be disappointed ordering this.The sashimi salads are also a great starter. I'm partial to salmon, but the tuna is also very good. The dressing is light and the greens are a really refreshing starter, especially when you've been eating nothing but heavy british food for awhile which I have been guilty of.The rock shrimp tempura is a classic. The shrimp is meaty, the tempura is not too oily, and there's a lot of it. So it's good for larger parties.In summary, I like going to Nobu because of the atmosphere and the service and just the overall feeling of luxury and being spoiled. Since the price is 5x more expensive than other places, is the quality 5x? meh, probably not. But like I said, if you are willing to put down the cash if only to guarantee a no hassle, relaxing, consistently delicious meal, Nobu will get the job done.",

Have your water/beer close at hand.Tuna Sashimi Salad with Matsuhisa Dressing (4/5): Probably what we liked least throughout the evening, but considering the competition - this is still high praise.Chilean Sea Bass Yasai Zuke (5/5): Highlight of the night.

The restaurant was full and service was a bit on the slow side to start but once we got our food it was game on. My friend and I ordered two bento boxes, the classic and the deluxe and shared them between us as well as some California crab rolls as well. It was plenty of food and we couldn't finish it all. The highlight for me was the black cod, which I also had on my last visit to Nobu. We decided to squeeze in dessert and shared the cheesecake, it was amazing and a great way to round off the meal. The presentation was great and it was tasty and refreshing, I would definitely recommend it. I can't wait to go back!",

Maybe this is more of an environmental issue but still then don't dare to charge a Nobu price.After I refused to pay the optional service charge due to dissapointing fish quality and just rude seating arrangements, I was treated like a criminal - never again at this Nobu location that's for sure!",

We were a group of 3, there were a fair few tables empty and yet we were given a tight tiny table for 2. I refused such a bad table and was given a proper sized table.Service was terrible, slow and quite frankly useless from start to end. At an early evening booking, how do you run out of the rib eye steak? Or that there was no Sauvignon blanc by the glass? That's pretty poor.Anyway, had the tacos, nothing particularly special. A selection of sushi and sashimi, decent taste with the fish as expected, the rice in the sushi was not the best made, fell off too,easily.The shrimp tempura was fine, but Zuma is another level, much nicer, they serve the whole shrimp in a much better batter. The asparagus tempura was fine, bit greasy, slightly too thick hence they were still a bit hard to break on the end pieces.I had ordered rice to come with the miso cod which was next. That rice never came so fish by itself, as tasty as the fish is, you need something else with it. Very disappointing.Finally the last course of tenderloin steak with rice finally. That was cooked rare perfectly and hat a spicy kick to it that worked. Dessert was just green tea ice cream and petite fours. Was ok.At the end they apologized for the slow/lacking service and gave the dessert free of charge but quite frankly , it shouldn't have been that bad.The service needs to improve. Zuma will stay number 1 by miles in my book.",

Service was impeccable which you could expect for the price you pay. Have been to several other locations like las Vegas and San Diego, CA with lavish decorations and decor. This location seemed a bit lacking with the \"wow\" factor decor-wise. The food however is what you would expect from a 5 star restaurant. Every dish expertly prepared and plated. All sashimi was as fresh as could be and paired with a bottle of Brunello seemed to make everything taste even better. Wagyu is a must have and a recommended favorite! 5 stars for food, taste, and service. Be prepared to spend large when coming to Nobu. Dinner for 2 came out to about $480 pounds with 15% gratuity included.",

    "text": "Erm... Where to start? So much to say... So we decided to do the very cliche thing - go to Nobu for Valentines Day! We dont really put much importance on Valentines day, its more an excuse for a fancy dinner! However we did have high expectations in terms of food. I remember many moons ago being repeatedly told by a friend in Rome that Nobu was the best restaurant in London. I remember thinking it would take me quite a few years before being able to afford. Although ive been able to for a couple years now, never got round to it, so this was exciting stuff. I want to start by saying the food was amazing. Really absolutely fantastic - ill go into more details below. However, when you pay this much and when you go somewhere with such a reputation you expect more, much more. So lets beginning:Absolutely no atmosphere, no vibe, nothing. This place has no soul. White walls, no decoration, nothing to excite you. Very bad very loud music, i guess thats what they might call \"atmosphere\", but you could barely hear yourself think and even less talk. Seats and tables were particularly uncomfortable. Lots of fancy people in fancy clothes but nothing else. Thats gotta be why it lost its star... Great food just isnt enough for michelin starred restaurants. You want an experience with insane food. Service was decent considering it was Valentines Day and surely a particularly busy evening. The food though... Thats another story, we had the Valentines Day 6 course menu, so didnt get to try the special and ph so famous black cod. However, i was not dissapointed with any ofthe dishes. They looked good and tasted good. Fancy japonese food at its best, combination of exciting flavours & luxury products (from a little caviar to classic lobster) cooked to perfection. Every dish was exceptional. Quick mention for the dessert, which i guess i expected less off. It was stunning, fresh & tasty. If we look at the food alone, i highly recommend, i wodeven want to go again and again and again. However you cant ignore the price tag, ita not cheap obviously. For thatprice id want thw food to be outstanding but also the restaurant also the atmophere... So overall, if you are looking for amazing food i would recommend, but if you are looking for an experience out of this world i wouldnt recommend. Honestly im not sure ill be back. \u00a0However, super keen to try Zuma now!",

    "text": "The Nobu restaurants are one of my favorites because of their usual amazing food and service. \u00a0However, I was disappointed when I recently visited Nobu Berkeley Street. Though the food tasted wonderful as usual, I was very agitated with the table service. I was sitting at a small table and servers continued to attempt to crowd the table with dishes, which made me feel rushed like they were trying to turn our table quickly. At other Nobu restaurants, dishes are served one by one so the guests can enjoy their dishes. The atmosphere of Nobu Berkeley street is loud: playing club lounge type music making conversation between those at your table difficult. If you are looking for Asian fusion, I would recommend you going across the street to Novikov's Asian restaurant where the food is delicious and service on point.",

You can get it (albeit much smaller) just about anywhere in Japan for about \u00a5450 to \u00a5900 (\u00a33 to \u00a39) opposed to the hefty \u00a332 they charge here. All the Nobu's I've been to do it the same way and the portion is very large and melts in your mouth. I went here for lunch and if I would have seen that the black cod was available as part of the lunch bento, I probably would have gotten that. I also ordered the ceviche, a spider roll, and the shitake salad. The ceviche was fresh and not overly done with citrus. The spider roll was average and looked rushed. The shitake salad was made with rehydrated shitake instead of fresh which leaves a long aftertaste I don't like. I'll definitely pass on the roll and salad again, but will be back for that bento with the cod.",

You still have to book way in advance though. Fantastic food every time. The black cod with miso is an absolute must for first timers. We get it every time we visit and it is just a delicious-melt-in-your-mouth-make-your-tastebuds-tingle experience. A nice buzzy bar on the ground floor too.
