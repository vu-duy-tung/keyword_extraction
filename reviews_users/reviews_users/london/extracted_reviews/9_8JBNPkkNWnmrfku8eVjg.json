Excellent desserts (2 for price of 1). Good offering for children plate. Recommended after visit to London Eye, good price/quality but avoid grilled plates if you want to don't want to eat unhealthy black grillled ingredients.",

We ordered the most amazing mezze platter and it was filled with olives, cured meats, houmous, breads and cheese - we were very impressed.Situated just off the river Thames the clientele ranges from tourists, locals and business types. It was lovely to sit sip wine, eat nibbles and watch the London eye fill and refill with people. Not necessarilly the most exciting venue but it ws perect for a catch up and a quick nibble of yummy food.",

YESSIR!Having a great location right by the London Eye, and close to my work, I think Slug & Lettuce is great! Going in for drinks/dinner is lovely. Besides the fact they chose to hire too little servers, I think it's a great place. The cocktails are nice, very fruity, my friend thinks their pretty strong. We ordered nachos as starters, but it wasn't that nice, very stale I feel and the cheese was overly cooked, it was like dried? The guacamole was nice. I tried the southern fried style chicken wrap, all i gotta say is that it was quite delicious! normally its like 5pounds, but with half off food, it was about 2.50pounds. Comes with a coleslaw as well. My friend got the open chicken pie, yes get it! It was great, the chicken melts in your mouth. The pastry was very nice and it comes with chips.We ordered \"water\" and she brought us 2 bottles of still water..that came out to be 1.85 pounds each. OUCH. I just wanted tap water! Our server seems to be quite busy, but did make a point to check on us every now and then, and be sure to tell them you are ready for your Main, or they won't bring it to you!*The 2nd time I came, it was 7pm on a Monday, the other server ignored us, and when I asked to be seated she just told me rudely all the dining tables were taken and walked away. Did not even try to give me a wait time! So we left. RUDE!!! but because you are luring me with your half-price food mondays, i will probably come back.

It was around 3PM when we got here and the place was basically dead. The server came to our table promptly but then took a while to bring back drinks considering we were the only ones in the whole place. We had *plenty* of time to browse the menu. They offer a wide variety of sandwiches, salads, flatbreads and a few meals as well. I went for the burger with bacon on top, a side of wedge fries and a spicy chili coleslaw. My boyfriend got chicken with watercress, tomatoes and mushrooms on top. My meal was decent but the burger was a bit boring. His meal was missing the sauce and tomatoes when it was delivered and took a while for the server to come back out with the items. Portion sizes were good. Overall, the food was decent but nothing spectacular and the service was just okay. The nice thing about this place is the environment, the decor had a very chic and upscale feel considering the prices were more of a middle-of-the-road kind of place. Considering we got the half off monday special, it ended up being a reasonable cost for our meal and for the most part we left happy & full. A-Ok overall.",

We enjoyed this place!",

I was told it wasn't on the menu and then when I pointed it out they got the bartender out who also said it wasn't on the menu. At this point I was willing to get something else but it was getting a little awkward and they just kept saying that they could do it. Then a manager came out and asked how I liked my hot toddy's made. I said again that could order something else but they insisted on making it. The fries were half fried and bland and the fried chicken sandwich looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours.",

They don't really have a traditional wait staff so just go to the bar and order. Simple menu, well mixed drinks! This place has figured It out",

    "text": "I just want to start by giving a few warnings/tips. At night Slug and Lettuce becomes a full on bar. They do still serve food, but the place is PACKED, plays THE LOUDEST MUSIC EVER, and everyone is drinking. No one under 18 is allowed inside. There is a full bar/club downstairs and the restaurant area is upstairs on the street level. You will not be seated when you arrive unless you stand around dumbfounded long enough, so just go ahead and grab a table. There is some table services, but the waiters may take a long time to come to you. You can always just head up to the bar to order your food and drinks. Food: As far as food goes, Slug and Lettuce was pretty \"meh.\" The menu is on the small side. Everything was fine, but nothing great at all. Portion sizes are average. Food prices are a little high, but nothing outrageous. The big attraction here is definitely the alcohol. They have some GREAT deals, which are available all day. We opted for the 2 for 1 cocktails. Drink prices are definitely higher than average, but with a 2 for 1 or happy our deal they are completely reasonable. Service: This is definitely not a typical restaurant. Service is really inconsistent and slow, but they're all friendly. They do eventually come by your table and take your order, but we had to wait a half hour almost. They are very quick about drinks, however, and they're very good about asking if you want another round. Atmosphere: As mentioned, Slug & Lettuce is definitely club/bar above all else, at least at dinner time. Don't come expecting a relaxed or upscale dining experience. The place is SUPER CRAZY LOUD because of the music and all the drunk people around. Also, it can get quite smokey inside due to everyone smoking right outside the entrance. The decor is quite nice.",

Although we didn't order drinks there were good drink specials going on. I was kind of bummed because I wanted to veggie mushroom burger but I ended up getting a salad which was good. It was kind of noisy in there but a lot of people were in there for happy hour. The food came out pretty quickly and the waitress was nice. I will be back next time I am in London.",

I also explained on the booking that we would be arriving from 6pm (some at slightly different times, as & when we all finished work) for some food and drinks, and would leave in time for an IMAX showing at 8.30.I wasn't expecting the food to be gourmet, but I was expecting it to be edible. I ordered the Chicken Mango & Avocado Burger which is described as a 'grilled chicken fillet, topped with fresh mango, tomato chilli salsa and sliced avocado'. What arrived was dry and burnt chicken breast in a stale bun and a tiny smear of tomato sauce. The only plus point is that there was half an avocado on top, but unfortunately it was completely unripe and rock solid. There was also no sign of the mango at all! I ordered that burger as I thought it sounded exciting and flavoursome, but it was bland, dry and the ingredients were clearly not fresh. I complained to the waiter that it was burnt and about the lack of mango, he very unapologetically told me that had run out of mango and that was the last chicken breast, so he couldn't get the kitchen to replace it. Eeeexcellent.To make matters worse, the rest of our group then arrived at 7.30pm and when they went to order food from the waiter he told them that the kitchen had closed. He very rudely told us that this was 'normal practice' and that they stopped at that time every evening. We questioned this as on the front of the menu it very clearly states 'food served until 10pm'. The manager eventually came over and (very begrudgingly ) agreed to put their orders through as we had said on our booking we would be ordering food.When the food for the 2nd group did arrive half of it was missing. They ordered the 'feast for friends' which arrived without ribs, breaded mushrooms and grilled chicken. Once again they didn't acknowledge nor apologise for it, and seemed to hope we wouldn't notice. When we did complain about it he said that we could have some free chips (?!), and said it was impossible for them to refund the meal as the only person with authority to put a refund through was not there.Every time he came over the waiter had moaned to us that they'd had a very busy 3 days and were short staffed. I had only made the booking for our table the day before, so in my opinion if they were aware they were that busy and short staffed they shouldn't have accepted my booking as we could have happily found somewhere else to go. If we weren't in a rush to get to a cinema screening afterwards I would have made more of a fuss as this was one of the worst paid dinner experiences I've ever had. Really, really poor.",

We got a lovely Spanish waiter, who really took the time to recommend wine to me and helped us with our food choices. This definitely added a star for me.Food wise, it was happy Monday so everything was half price and bargain tastic. I think for full price, I'd have given 3 stars because it's a bit pricey for a pub/chain restaurant, but half price it's a steal, so no surprises it was packed. I got the salmon, which was quite flavoursome and came with a few wedges, kinda a small portion and was definitely in need of a side - which my friend ordered in the form is sweet potato fries! Oh nom nom, seriously good! She got the butternut squash lasagne which she was loving. So main courses, ticked the boxes and then for the best part of the meal - dessert! That did more than tick the box - it blew the box out of the water! So frickin good! We both got the Irish cream and ameretti cheesecake and I'm glad we did, because that is one thing I wouldn't want to share! No words - shamazing!!",

We had told Marta we'd come back to see her before we left, when we arrived, she had reserved a table for us, which I thought was very nice! This time, I ordered the Long Island iced teas, 4 drinks in and had a nice buzz, unlike the night before with the cherry colas.

The mushy peas had mint in them which caused them to be a brighter than normal green. I had a hard time deciding how I felt about them. They were not bad, but the flavor and texture was a bit odd. My cousins had burgers and reported that they were good. We were here during off hours and it was not busy. This may be why our service was better then what other reviewers experienced.",

So we \u00a0agreed on trying out Slugs and Lettuce for breakfast.Trying to embrace the London/ English culture we chose to have the \"Traditional English Breakfast\" with their \"Traditional English tea with milk and sugar\" OMG! it was so good! and the portion sizes were HUGE!! (we're Canadian btw, so our sizes are smaller than most places). I was so full I seriously didn't even have lunch. Everything was just amazing! The server was so polite and helpful. I think this place is great for a budget breakfast. (7.50 pounds for the dish and tea)",
