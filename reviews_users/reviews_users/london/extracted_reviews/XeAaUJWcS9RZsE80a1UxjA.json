As one would say in mexico I felt this was a: 'robo a mano armada' in other words; way too expensive for what it really was. That being said, service (by Alejandra) was good. My Michelada was good. Pipian Duck was chewy and overpriced. Restaurant lacked atmosphere (music?!) and the manageress (?) kept cackling on the phone all through my meal. Starter, main and drink for 29gbp?! Will NOT be coming back or recommending. A great disappointment.",

I liked it although it won't become my favorite mexican dish. Tacos forever! :) Besides it felt quite pricey... On average 6 GBP for Tacos and main courses start at 11 up to 20 GBP. Not really a place for students to go.Staff was super attentive and helpful - maybe it was a slow Sunday evening with few customers.",

    "text": "This place was recommended to us by a woman we met at a restaurant at London who had grown up in Los Angeles with a Mexican family. She said Mestizo was the best Mexican food she'd found in London, and we found it to be great.Overwhelmed by all of the options on the menu we decided to try something new: a \"hot pot\"-like dish with meat, cheese, and veggies. It was served in a scalding-hot stone pot and was the perfect antidote to the cold outside.Tequila lovers will enjoy the bar with a huge menu of blanco, reposado, and anejo tequilas. They'll even make you a bandera, a drink with three shots: red sangrita, white tequila, and green lime juice.As a minor note, their tortilla chips could use a bit of work. Looking forward to going back and trying the rest of their menu.Gluten-free notes: The corn tortillas are not normally made with the usual masa harina and salt -- they are normally made with some wheat flour as well. But they will kindly make you your own gluten-free, corn-only tortillas. Awesome.",

The tacos they had were more like the tacos I used to have back in California than anywhere else I've been to.

The food was good, very filling and we had a huge platter of different meats and sauces with piles of hot tacos. However, I can't quite say the atmosphere was all that great in comparison. Because there was a group of us, a table was booked in their downstairs dining room, which felt quite detached from the main hub of the restaurant. For a Mexican restaurant you sort of expect a more vibrant, lively experience. The only thing 'vibrant' and 'lively' here were the fire engine red walls which contrasted greatly with the bright white seating. There is a downstairs bar/ lounge area, which, unlike the upstairs, is a little bit better designed, where the use of the red doesn't seem as offensive. I think a downside is its location being on Hampstead Road as this means that it's away from the more bustling parts of town, and a place like this should be in an area where there is more of an abundance of life!",

The first impression I had of Mestizo was that it smelled amazing. Absolutely, the atmosphere, smells included, is one of the great things about the restaurant. The decorations are colourful and engaging, and the service staff is attentive throughout the entire dining experience. I think we even had the pleasure to speak with the manager that night, as I asked about some of the menu options.Speaking of, their menu is elaborate, extensive and authentic--definitely anyone can find something they will like at Mestizo. They offer a Happy Hour deal too, which includes a small tapas for the table. That was a nice touch.My meal was the Enchiladas Cancun with a Coco Loco to drink, and both were quite nice. They weren't as spicy as I like--my palette is quite ruined by the heat of Tex-Mex in the States. At the same time, they were definitely authentic Mexican and certainly flavourful. For all your Mexican needs, I'd recommend Mestizo. They have lots of options, and are pleased to work with you to make the meal an enjoyable experience",

So we ordered a pitcher of margaritas (which we found quite funny that they had to tell us that on the rocks was an extra \u00a32, then coming back and telling us it was actually an extra \u00a34), some guacamole, empanadas, and two orders of the Ancho Chile and Pork rellenos. The margaritas were good, I've had better, and I've definitely had worse. Next time, I think I might go for the sangria.To start out, the tortilla chips. Meh. Kinda stale, so they'd been around a little while. Doubtful they're made in house, but it's possible. If they are, I don't know why they wouldn't make them to order, and give you a nice warm bowl of tortilla chips (they do it in the states, it can't be hard to do it in the UK). They do give (albeit a small amount of) complimentary chips and salsa. With some rather disappointing and flavorless salsa. The guacamole was alright, nothing special. I can make better at home. It was missing something, garlic perhaps? Maybe a bit of cilantro (coriander to UK folks)? I don't know. The empanadas were okay as well. To be honest, after the starters (and the starter menu wasn't too impressive to boot), I was a bit worried.However, the mains were amazing. The rellenos were full of flavor, and the pork was succulent. Both of us were quite impressed. The beans on the side were good, the rice, strangely, was pretty much just basmati rice. Which was a bit weird, but with the ancho chile sauce, I ate it all!We then decided to split the tres leches cake and have some Mestizo coffee. Both of which were delicious. Actually my dining companion kept pointing at her coffee and saying it was delicious. She was quite impressed with the level of food we had here. So a full on four-start joint. So why only three stars? I don't know. I originally wanted to give four, but the atmosphere of the place was a bit of a letdown. It just didn't feel like a fun place to go with a group of friends and enjoy some delicious Mexican. More like a quiet few friends Mexican joint. I wish Yelp gave half stars, I'd definitely go with a 3.5.On a fun note, they give out recipe cards containing the recipes for all the rellenos during the Chile Pepper festival! So go now and get some rellenos and recipes. They apparently also have a Tamales festival, an Enchiladas festival, and a Mole festival. I'll definitely be back during all of them to try out their special menus. I may even go back and try again. Maybe I can find a starter I really like. However, if I had a large group of friends, or even a small group of friends who like to have a raucous time, I'll be hitting up one of the other Mexican joints in town.They also have an extensive Tequila tasting menu, if that's your thing. I saw a lot of people with the flights of Tequila on their table.",

Sadly, I booked a party of 22 on a Sunday, and rather than 'here are some free chips and salsa' or a drink, or whatever, as a thank you for booking a huge table, we got 'brunch is \u00a324.99' when brunch is \u00a319.99 - it is always \u00a319.99, and there are signs all over saying it is that price. They decided to add a huge tip, \u00a35.00, to each person's bill. I was pretty offended by that. We would have tipped anyway, but, \u00a35.00 each for a \u00a319.99 per person bill? Are you kidding me!? The food is good, but that was very uncool of them. I told the manager we refused to pay it, and we all gave \u00a33.00 each to the server, not the manager, as we left. I'm sad, because I like the food. It isn't really possible to get very much OK Mexican in London. I do not believe I will ever go back after that experience, even thought my other three experiences there were all very good.",

Until very recently, I had no idea that this delectable, delightful and unrivaled Mexican speciality even existed in London.....and then I came across Mestizo. Forget Chipotle burritos and quesadillas from Wahaca, Mestizo is as authentic as Mexican food gets in London. Ok, so it may not rival California's Mexican cuisine, but we must keep in mind that we are 5,000 miles away. What I can attest to is that the menu features a vast range of specialties - the first that i've seen in London - from Mole Poblano and Mole Verde (sooooo good!), to Enchiladas, Empanadas, Flautas, Jaladas, Al Pastor tacos, Tamales, and their house specialty, the Molcajete Mestizo bowl. My self-professed \"Mexican food-obsessed\" British friends hadn't even heard of half of these dishes! \u00a0Needless to say, they loved each and every one..yeah, we tried them all - it was educational dining after all!We washed our food down with a round of Margaritas which were devilishly strong and massive by London standards. The drinks menu also boasts \"skinny margaritas,\" so if you're on a diet, fear not, you can still indulge - \u00a0although, I can't say the same for the rest of the menu!I was delighted by the extensive salsa menu as well...you can get everything from pico de gallo to salsa verde, habanero, poblano and chipotle sauces. I was literally in a state of mouth burning euphoria that I haven't experienced since my last visit to Gus' Lunch Box in Silverlake (Los Angeles transplants will know what i'm talking about here). There are only 2 major things that I can fault Mestizo on (hence the 4 stars): tortilla chips and white wine. Their tortilla chips are served cold and I can't be fooled here - this isn't right. I have yet to find anywhere in London that sells the piping hot, straight-out-of-the-fryer bad boys that are a staple back home. Note to the owner: hot chips would go down really really well! Secondly, their house wine was pretty disgusting. They only offer one white by the glass and it was bland, lackluster and incapable of holding up to the flavors and spices of the menu... but I guess the solution could always be sticking to the margaritas!All in all, Mestizo is a winner in my books. They've got Mole, Enchiladas and Tamales......i'm sold!",

    "text": "If you're after a Mexican restaurant in London with a proper, varied menu containing actual Mexican food, then Mestizo is your place.Planning on having dinner in the area wedged between Euston and Camden before a gig one night, I figured it was as good a time as any to finally try out this rather contested London Mexican joint. No, I did not hyphenate that. I did not mean London-Mexican, a cuisine of Mexican inspiration but ultimately London origin. I meant Mexican food in London. Because that's what this is. As close to proper Mexican food in London as you're going to get. Forget burritos.I unknowingly came during a week-long chile relleno festival, which was fortuitous, as chile relleno is my favourite Mexican dish. However, this meant that the regularly vast menu was not available, and my companion was forced to choose from the comparatively limited selection of mostly chile-relleno-inspired dishes. Hey ho. Sucks to be him.I got a chile relleno with black bean sauce. The sauce was completely delicious, and the chile relleno was more than I had hoped for, so bereft I've been of Mexican food over the last several years. The meal came with actual corn tortillas, a mighty treat. It also came with some black beans and rice on the side, which were, I admit, not so great. But the main meal, fantastic. Really, truly. I also got some guacamole to start, and it was refreshing and prepared as I would expect it to be, which was refreshing in itself compared to all the horrible guacamole atrocities I've been subject to in this town.As for the service, it was stellar during my visit. The server was attentive (some of a more British disposition might say overly so) and honest. When my dining companion unadventurously asked if the chicken nacho starter would be big enough as a main, she replied that it would. However, she made a face and said, 'But, well, you could get nachos at the cinema.' He thought this rather rude, but I thought it merely an interesting way of suggesting that he get something else while not actually saying his choice was wrong. Most other servers in London restaurants would just take your ill-judged nacho order and bring your disappointing meal to you with a pathetic little clatter on the table as the plate of tortilla chips covered in cheese comes to a stop in front of you, your Mexican meal of dubious origin.The costs are high here, but we're not exactly living on the border of Mexico, so you should probably stop complaining. Me? I'll pay \u00a320 for some tamales and margaritas any day of the week. Happily.",

In an unassuming location just a few moments away from Euston, I knew I was in for a treat the moment I stepped in the door. Not only were the hostesses and servers SO FRIENDLY, but they were also Mexican! When asking one of our servers about the spice level of a dish before ordering (is it flaming hot? will it make us cry?) she laughed and said, \"well, I'm Mexican so I think it's all relative...\" SCORE! After a particularly challenging work week, I decided to go all out and order a Cadillac Margarita with Patron Silver and I have to say that it was the most amazing margarita I've had outside of Mexico or Southern California. Mestizo boasts 150 different varieties of tequila and I'll definitely be back to sample some more. The starter of guacamole was a delight - perfectly seasoned with plenty of chips. My carnitas tacos melted in my mouth and the chicken mole that my partner had was equally delicious. For dessert, I decided to go with bu\u00f1uelos, a crispy fried dough with cinnamon and caramel sauce...again something I haven't seen outside of Mexico and my home state. As if they were trying to outdo themselves, my dessert arrived and was a literal symphony of one fantastic flavor after the next. The whole thing was perfect. I will come back to Mestizo again and again and couldn't recommend it highly enough! I think my stomach is still smiling!",

I ordered the mole (pronounced molay), and didn't like it one bit.

(Just for the record: Tex-Mex is NOT mexican! which is what you get mostly in USA, and southern california too).It was quite surprising to find out that a place like Mestizo actually existed in London. Being Mexican myself, Im not a big fan of mexican food outside Mexico, but this one really made me forget for a moment that I was an ocean away.This restaurant is more gourmet Mexican cuisine, and the ingredients are pretty authentic. It does come with a price since the place is not cheap (not too expensive either) however, it was definitely well worth it. The \"Mole Poblano\" and everything esle I've ever ordered there has been very tasty. Probably the only thing is tortillas are a bit different that the usual \u00a0in Mexico, however I guess its as good as you can do them here.Their Tequila selection is wide and varied, and for tequila of the week they displayed Tequila Ambar, which was a proof that their offer is very high quality. And we had som very good cocktails too!Something else: People, please STOP taking southern californian food as refererence to Mexican. What is found in the USA is mostly tex-mex food which is mexican-inspired but not mexican-authentic. Want authetic? Look at the number above and make your reservation.",

    "text": "A couple friends of mine who live in London wanted to impress me by taking me to this Mexican restaurant. \u00a0I was skeptical at first, but I checked out the menu and it had a lot of legitimately authentic items on it, so I figured, why not?The menu was more limited than we expected because they had a special tamale week going on. \u00a0Well who doesn't love tamales? \u00a0I decided to split some with my husband and a friend, although they got the order severely confused. \u00a0One of the tamales was great, but I found the other ones a bit bland and dry.I love huitlacoche and it's impossible to find in Germany, so I ordered the huitlacoche and veggie crepes. \u00a0It was OK, but somewhat bland. \u00a0It didn't help that in addition to the veggies in the crepe, I had a load of steamed veggies as a side, with no seasoning whatsoever. \u00a0At this price point, I'd expect the sides to be more creative or interesting.I tried the chicken dishes that my friends ordered, and found them unimpressive as well. \u00a0I mean, tasty sauces, but I'd expect a bit more than grilled chicken downing in sauce for $20. \u00a0The service was also slow and indifferent, even with simple drinks like beers. \u00a0I will say the margarita I had was good.I think the restaurant would be better served by making the menu much smaller and focusing on improving the flavor and quality of their dishes. \u00a0Maybe it was just an off-night, but I'd be wary of coming back when there's so much other delicious food to eat in London.",

The first visit was quite a few months ago and I had the enchiladas mole and although there was quite a lot of sauce, it was cooked without fault. More recently, I went without knowing that there was a \"Chile Festival\" on meaning the main menu wasn't being served. I'm not a chile fan (seeing as I can't handle spicy foods) so passed on much of it, but was still able to have a good meal. We started with a selection of empanadas - there were 3 types - cheese, mushroom and one with meat. They were all very nice. Then we had a taco selection tray for two - so much food! We had a selection of meats - pork, beef and chicken, prepared differently. My favorite was one of the pork fillings, very tasty and tender. I could only eat about 3 until I was completely stuffed.Then there are the drinks. Delicious margaritas. Done.",

My BFF Bertha always told me, never trust a Mexican place that doesn't have Mexicans working at it, and alas, the sign on the wall welcomed my eyes with \"We don't speak English but we promise to not make fun of your Spanish\". I need to go back for the weekend brunch deal... honestly I want to live here... they even have jarritos! Make a booking online, it seemed to fill up quicker than we had anticipated..

    "text": "The Englishman and I love a proper Mexican restaurant. Mestizo is one that he had been to before and was really excited for me to try it. Unfortunately, it seems that Mestizo has changed their ways and left us really disappointed. It's not the food that left us extremely disappointed (the food is great!), it's the value for money. Which is why I'm so surprised at all the reviews that say it's not overpriced and affordable. That was the most I've ever spent on a Mexican meal in my entire life, and I left hungry. First, we made a later reservation for a group of us, so the Englishman and I arrived starving. The staff kept bringing over much appreciated tortilla chips and different salsas for us to munch on while the rest of our party arrived. The drink prices are steep. So we opted to share a big pitcher of margaritas between four of us and I had a Paloma before we shared the pitcher. I think we each got two drinks out of the pitcher, so it was a bit cheaper doing it that way. We ordered the guacamole to share. For \u00a37, it's apparent from a conversation last night that a week or so later we still feel burned by that price. For \u00a37, you get a not very generous portion of guacamole and some chips. It was agreed that the guacamole wasn't even as good as mine. Such a waste of time and money. Then we shared the taco platter between four people, which was an enormous price in itself as you ended up with 4 tacos each. That's not enough for a main course. I don't mind paying higher prices for generous portions of great food. However, when I left wondering if I could grab a McDonalds burger on the way home after spending \u00a340 and leaving the restaurant still significantly hungry, you can't help but feel totally burned on the value for money. I was hesitant to tell the Englishman I was really disappointed with the astronomic prices, however he expressed the same feeling. They had come here before and were amazed by the quality and the affordability of the food. It's unfortunate that the prices no longer reflect this. At Christmas time, the Englishman and I ordered exactly the same things and then some at a different Mexican restaurant, and we paid less than we did with sharing between four people. That puts the value for money into perspective. There are more affordable and equally authentic Mexican restaurants in London.",

And not just because of the small free Margherita offer I found on a social networking site just after we arrived!The Flautas were very tasty. They actually were not quite as good as the ones I enjoyed in the States, but they were still delicious and grew on me as I went on.My main course was Enchiladas rojas....at least it should have been. I had chosen the rojas because my starter and the chips they warm you up with both came with the verde sauce. But my main found it easier being green all the same and because I'm a Brit I just ate it anyway. And it was very good. The rice was kinda plain but the dish as a whole was very very tasty so the order error was quickly mostly forgiven.Classy place with a nice relaxed vibe to it. There did seem to be a guy who had been stood up on the table next to us though. Que Incomodo!!!",

(Otherwise it would be at one of the #Empellon empire places in New York.)Mestizo has a snazzy looped promo video rolling over widescreen TV's making me feel all the more like I'm in a bustling themed establishment, but I'm being sold Mexico in a travel information film, thrust down my throat along with the pretty colours of Mexico in the film: lush Green Guacamole and rich red Rojas, as hypnotising as the ace house blended Margaritas. Seeing a joyful film of a pi\u00f1ata being bashed about, a rainbow of colour cascading across the wall, I told my date that I was trying not to visualise that that was what my brain was going feel like the next morning having tried most of the well stocked Tequila bar.This place is authentic street food, come treat food. Whilst tripping on the visuals, Tamales were still tasty, just like my date had had in Me-hee-ko apparently, (I'm sorry excuse me, no I'm not saying Mexico in a Spanish accent, that's me hiccuping on booze and really spicy food).",

    "text": "I was over the moon when I opened \u00a0the menu at Mestizo and saw not UK Mexican, or American-Mexican, but Mexican Mexican ... Mole! Cochinita pibil! Street style tacos not deep-fried, greasy and hard-shelled, but made with fresh, soft corn tortillas and served not heaped with sour cream but with a sprinkle of chopped cilantro and onion.I love the fresco, authentico (my Spanish is impressive, i know) take on Mexican cuisine, served by staff who know the menu and are happy to answer if you have questions. If you're looking for greasy, deep-fried and fatty, you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for cheap - price and/or ingredients - you'll also be disappointed. Now for specifics. I've tried the above-mentioned tacos (cochinita pibil and carnitas), the tamales (pollo and queso/peppers) and the enchiladas (potato and cheese). The slow roasted pork was divine, the corn tortillas savory and of excellent texture and flavor (nothing worse than a piece of cardboard masquerading as a corn tortilla). The carnitas weren't mind blowing, but I have a long history of dislike for carnitas meat, which always feels tough and chewy to me (nothing like the juicy and melt-in-your-mouth cochinita).The tamales were on the appetizer section, and you get two that could be mixed and matched between a selection of three. I definitely preferred the queso y raja; the chicken mix wasn't too flavorful and bit too \"wet\" for a tamale stuffer. The masa was a bit loose for my preference but the taste was spot on. The potato and cheese enchiladas were excellent, a nice portion --- though it looked small at first I couldn't finish it in the end. The side of refried black beans on the side were freaking delicious. I prefer pinto but these were just as savory. I have to say the tortilla chips and salsa waiting for us on the table were the most disappointing of the meal. Too hard, definitely homemade in house, but didn't feel or taste very fresh. The salsa was thin and spicy, but not much flavor to that either. To avoid ending on a downer, I'll make a note about the tequila selection, if that's your thing. If you've only ever had Jose Cuervo, by god get down to this place and get a tequila taster or attend one of their tequila education courses/tastings.",

I discovered this place a couple months ago and have been meaning to write about it because it has never failed to disappoint!My boyfriend and I always get the taco tray and it was so good the first time that we actually haven't tried anything else since. The carnitas meat is always so moist and juicy, which gives it a lot of good flavour making it taste so good! There are also lots of different toppings for the taco- different salsas, onions, cilantro, sour cream, guacamole, black beans, etc. The tray comes with flour tortillas, but you can request corn tortillas, as that's what we like best.They also give you complimentary chips and salsa upon arrival, which is a nice start to the meal. For a starter we've tried the flautas, or taquitos as I usually call them, and those were delicious as well!I also can't say enough good things about the staff as well. They are always so wonderful and welcoming, remembering us and happy to cater to all of our extra requests that we ask! In conclusion, if I could go to Mestizo ever night for dinner, I definitely would as I don't think I could ever get tired of their amazing food!",

    "text": "So I've heard a lot about this place, but it was an overall disappointment. Been meaning to come here for a while now. On the food: it's good. Some of it is stellar, but it's also a bit of a let-down. Some of the best mol\u00e9 I've had in years over chewy chicken and beef, with nary a vegetable to mix is up. And old, stale, corn tortillas. The service was similarly quixotic, fluctuating between over-attentive and under-attentive. And there was glass in my friend's mouth. She ended up bleeding from finger and mouth, and while the staff were apologetic, even giving us a bottle of wine (which we didn't particularly want), they didn't make it right. I can't work out what Mestizo wants to be: if it wants to be a party haven, with flights of tequila tasting, bringing Mexican street food top the fore, a cocktail bar, or what. It's good food, expensive for what you get, but one is constantly let down.The decor is perhaps a bit offensive as well: twee stereotypical modern light-up \"Mayan\" carvings and televisions playing an endless loop of the Mexican version of \"Visit Britain\" commercials. Distracting. I really wanted to like this place - but I just couldn't at the end. It might have the best mol\u00e9 sauce this side of the Atlantic - and I'm sure there will be several parts of meals as good, but it drops the ball in too many other areas.",

And finally, we've found the spot to get our fix in London. Went for the Sunday all you can eat brunch today. Everything was delicious: - They have a taco/quesadilla station where they will hook you up with whatever fillings you want. - There is a soup station with several choices including my fave pozule. - The tamales are yum!- There is also a whole buffet table lined up with all kinds of tasty mexican dishes. I was really impressed by their mole sauce which is really I only know a few places even in Los Angeles that gets it right. The chicken with verde sauce was another favorite - great scooped in warm corn tortillas- Corn tortillas!!! - Horchata: They also brought us a big pitcher for the table to share of this typical Mexican sweet rice milk drink with vanilla and cinnamon. There is also a couple deserts available. I managed to eat a bit of flan and a vanilla/passion fruit cake. The Sunday brunch buffet is \u00a320 per person but well worth it especially if you go hungry and stuff your face. You won't need to eat again for the rest of the day. Go home and take a siesta after your meal :)Service was wonderful too. The staff were friendly and it was so nice to hear folks speaking Spanish.

The queso fundido with chorizo is fantastic. The chihuahua cheese mix really hits the spot and reminds me of home. Less creamy than I'm used to, but still really good. The guacamole was fresh and flavorful. The chips also were quite nice- fresh tasting, not stale, right amount of salt. I had nachos for my main and they were the only decent nachos I've had in London. Decent is and understatement though. They were DELICIOUS. Beans, the right kinds of cheese, jalape\u00f1os, chicken. Not soggy, still crunchy and amazing. Would've been better if it came with salsa on it, but I was able to add some that my friends had on the side. Made it very yummy!For drinks we just did a pitcher of the house margarita on the rocks. Nothing fancy, but it hit the spot!My friends ordered the taco tray. Loved every filling. Solid amount of food too, no one left hungry, but everyone left happy.",

Service is good, but not chilled, and the layout of the place makes it kind of uncomfortable for everyone even though it's a large and fastidiously decorated space. Make sure you are facing the outdoors or you will have to stare at that massive flat screen showing the airbrushed beauties of central America in slow-mo.Food is fuss-filled, which I dislike as Mexican cuisine is all about being filling and practical yet quality of food itself is good: fresh, great presentation, really lovely drinks. Ok place for a first date, not so much for a business meal. Tip: Drink tequila and order some rice on a side!",

Happy hour prices aren't that happy, but wow- there are many drinks to choose from and they're very tasty!They even have their own vegan menu! (They have a few diet-specific menus, you can check them out on the website).I had the vegan taco tray for 2. When it first came, I was a bit disappointed. I was afraid it wasn't going to be enough with all those little bowls. But all those little bowls are filled with fun and when added to warm corn torillas, you have yourself quite a filling dinner, mister!We ended up speaking to the owner, who is a vegetarian herself. The Sunday Brunch sounds great and if you let them know ahead of time, they will have extra vegan items out for you! She said besides the meat and eggs, everything else is vegan.They have a very large array of tequilas (I believe the most in London) and the sampling platter looks great. One day.There is a hole in my heart for Mexican food and I'm happy Mestizo is there for me. I'm very much looking forward to my next visit!",

    "text": "I was excited when one of Mr. Snarky's friends invited us to a birthday dinner at Mestizo. \u00a0I was more excited when I saw that they had special menus for those with dietary restrictions, including Lactose Intolerance! \u00a0That's awesome! \u00a0While there are brightly coloured decorations, I think the dark walls and the dimmed lighting mute the decorations a bit. \u00a0The staff seemed a bit confused about our reservations so we ended up just perching at the bar and having drinks until the person who coordinated the reservation arrived. \u00a0The bar is at the back with a few seats, but you get the feeling that the area doesn't really get used that often. \u00a0There were about 15 of us arriving at different times and all standing at the bar having drinks. \u00a0It is a bit cozy with that many people, mostly because there are also tables just opposite the bar. \u00a0They do have a lovely selection of tequila. No Jose Cuervo here! \u00a0I decided to have a drink called the Don Roberto with tequila, grapefruit juice, Campari, even black pepper. \u00a0It was delicious and the tequila they used was really smooth.Eventually the staff seated us at the tables next to the bar. \u00a0Good call. \u00a0We did notice there were other large groups dining at the same time. \u00a0Clearly a place for groups to gather, but it does get loud and the staff are a bit disorganized with the groups. \u00a0In fact, I thought the staff were a bit rude with our group. \u00a0I get it is difficult to wait on a large group, but we're still paying customers. \u00a0There was some confusion over starters and the lady had mentioned that not many people had ordered starters so they would bring them out at the same time as the mains. \u00a0Because of that, Mr. Snarky and I decided not to order a starter... we also thought that maybe we wouldn't need a starter because we always end up so full at Mexican restaurants. \u00a0While there weren't many people that ordered starters, they did bring them out ahead of mains which meant those of us that were really hungry and didn't order starters had to wait until they had finished their starters.When the mains did start to come out, things got more chaotic as one of the staff was yelling at other staff, trying to direct the orders. \u00a0It looked like everyone got the correct order and the food looked really delicious. \u00a0We did notice that on the menu it mentions that you can choose from rice, beans, sauteed potatoes, or steamed veg with the mains, but they didn't ask us what our preference was. \u00a0It was lucky for me and Mr. Snarky as we got rice and beans. \u00a0Unfortunately for Mr. Snarky it wasn't refried pinto beans, it was black beans that were a bit soupy. \u00a0Some people seemed to enjoy what they were having, particularly the people who ordered the Mestizo Bowl for two, but Mr. Snarky and I found our mains quite bland.I had the Chile Relleno with the spiced beef (there was also some veg like peas, potatoes, raisins). \u00a0Surprisingly, I didn't taste any of the Poblano Chile and the spiced beef wasn't very spicy. \u00a0The rice was bland, but made a bit better by mixing it with the black beans. \u00a0There was a red sauce on my plate, however, it was difficult to scrape some up to put on the chile or the rice as it looked like it may have just been for decoration. \u00a0Mr. Snarky had the Enchilada Rojas as he was looking for something familiar, but after he took the first bite, I could see the disappointment on his face. \u00a0After the second bite he said that it was very bland. \u00a0I always find it difficult to understand how Mexican food can be bland... it is full of chiles and spices and I expect it to be a fiesta in my mouth.Another reviewer mentioned how they have never paid so much for Mexican food and left hungry, I would agree that statement. \u00a0We were so hungry that Mr. Snarky and I were trying to plan a getaway to get to one of the burrito places around London. \u00a0We did order dessert, Mr. Snarky asked about the Strawberry Tamal, but the waiter couldn't tell him what it was nor did he try to find out. \u00a0Based on the fact that 'Tamal' looked a lot like 'Tamale', I told Mr. Snarky to expect something like that. \u00a0And that is exactly what it was, a sweet tamale. \u00a0It was ok, but it might not be to everyone's taste. \u00a0I had the flan, which was nice, but lacking in caramel-y syrup. \u00a0I noticed that everyone that got the cheesecake had a bite, but didn't finish them. If you have a birthday, watch out... you get cake, they sing, and there is a sombrero... however, there is also a shot of something and quite a violent shake as you are forced to take the shot. \u00a0While it is entertaining to watch, our birthday boy did not seem to enjoy it and his neck was quite sore afterward.The atmosphere is great, especially for drinks and maybe for snacks before going out, but I'm not sure what I think about the place as a restaurant. \u00a0It just seems like they might be trying to do too much instead of focusing on one aspect.",

    "text": "I had been told that if you go to Mestizo you HAVE to try the taco tray. So onwards I went in my Mexican journeyWe went pretty early evening and we were a bit apprehensive because we were literally the only people in the restaurant. But a couple of drinks later, all was well and we took the plunge into the land of taco trays. With this beautiful thing you get unlimited tortillas (corn or flour) and a tray of sundries with four kinds of meat and lots of different salsas and guacamole and everything you would expect. The meat was juicy and tender and you got a fair few tacos from them. My only complaint is that all the pots are the same size so you get the same volume of one meat as you do guacamole or sour cream. These are things you would want to use on every taco while there are four meats. Therefore, the ratio of meat to sour cream/guac leads you on a road to disappointment when inevitably you have meat left and have to resort to a guac-less taco. Who wants to live in a world without guacamole? I know I don't. tl;dr: The taco tray is a genius invention but there is a dearth guacamole and sour cream. Overall the food is good but nothing to set your world alight",

The place was freaking packed but everything seemed to be moving quit efficiently. Service was great. They checked on us multiple times before we were ready, but we also took a long ass time to decide what to get. I especially liked our waiter because he was SO BUSY but he still managed to make jokes with us, so that's cool. Jokes are always cool. When you initially look at the menu it doesn't seem as though you can change much, but when talking with the waiter it became clear that they would pretty much cater to whatever you want. For example the taco tray seemed like you could only order meat, but when I asked about veggie options he started listing off a ton of stuff. The taco tray is seriously the best. You get SO MANY OPTIONS and can build so many glorious tacos from all the beautiful ingredients! Win.I really wanted to try their mole, and can't say I was impressed, but you know what, that's ok and life will go on. Their quesadillas marquesa was creamy and full of warm cheese and potatoes (I think?). It was a really nice dish. I also had their jalape\u00f1o margarita, and tried the cadillac margarita which was super strong and wonderful. Both were different and really fresh and yummy.I would certainly come back here again and bring friends. It was strange eating at a Mexican restaurant when I'm so used to only going to places in Texas. I really enjoyed it though, and would definitely recommend their margaritaaaaaas! aye aye aye!",

I ordered the Sopa de Tortilla - and was given a bowl full of dry tortilla strips. I was somewhat confused about what I had ordered, when a waiter arrived and poured the most delicious soup over top. Everyone else opted to snack on nachos which disappeared quickly. For my meal I ordered the Crepas de Flor de Calabaza; the vegetables inside were cooked perfectly and the flavors were amazing. My husband was very satisfied with his potato and cheese Enchiladas Verdes. The only regret is that the veggie tacos for two were not as kid friendly as we had hoped. There were beans, pico and salsas, and also pickled cactus and Mexican truffles which challenged the kids' adventurous tastes. I tried everything and it was delicious, just not perfect for the kids. The portions were generous and everything we tried was delicious. We left full and happy - I don't think time will allow us to be back for another meal on this trip, but we would return happily.",

Tonnes of vegetarian options on the menu all through out. We started with delicious ginger margaritas, recommended by the waitress. We also got to try tamales for the first time (they usually don't come in a vegetarian variety) and their guacamole as a starter was heavenly.

    "text": "Being a Texpat, life can certainly be difficult. The extreme lack of Mexican food with any resembling factor of Mexican cuisine is terrible. I try Mexican restaurants with a hopeless attitude. I expect to walk away disappointed, so my attitude is already lost. Today, however, there was a ray of hope. It isn't like being back home 100%, but it is quite good and gives you a comforting feel to the food. Quite good and authentic. The ambiance of the restaurant is a bit upscale. This is in contrast to the typical Mexican Restaurant, but it was a detractor. The food had great flavors. The salsas were quite nice. And free chips (granted there were only like 10 of them) was a nice addition. The lunch prices were quite good. 5-7 pounds for a meal. I appreciated this. All-in-all this is a restaurant worth going a little out of your way for if it is of interest to you.",

We took my dad there for an early Father's Day dinner , & from the beginning I could tell it wasn't going to be great. We had a reservation but they still took a LONG time just to take our drink order. Half of the stuff we wanted they did not have & the waitress (believe she might of even been the owner) looked bothered every time we spoke with her . My dad wanted a dish that apparently was for two people & she was incredibly rude to him because he wanted to order that ! After my husband ordered a drink and it was NOT brought out to him. The food wasn't that great, kind of cold. We later were served by a male staff member he was super nice very friendly & recommended the tres leche cake, that I can honestly say is the ONLY thing I enjoyed there.",

The tamales are decently sized and served steaming, as all good tamales should be. They tasted very good, with a decent enough serving of queso and rajas. But not spectacular. I've had better in Mexico. We also got guac and chips for the table and that was fine enough. My husband got three horchatas so no complaints there! My friend and I split tacos: one order of nopales and one of flor de calabaza. The orders are served in smallish bowls, but filled almost to the brim, so a great serving size for the price. Also, there is a separate dish offered for an array of spicy sauces. Lovely to look at. But out food was just... fine. The nopales had a bit more of a zing but the flor de calabaza was very bland. The corn tortillas at least were lovely (served hot, thin and didn't fall apart completely when wrapping food). My husband said his pollo con mole was decent but again, nothing to rave over. I admit my bar for Mexican food is very high after living on the Texas-Mexican border. For fantastic Mexican food go to Taqueria in Notting Hill instead. Or even Breddo's Tacos has fabulous fusion creations (although at a much higher price point).",

I couldn't finish it and it was pretty sweet so if you're not into sweet desserts beware!",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about this place - there were hits and misses but on the whole I think they'd entice me back. Probably because I'm still dreaming about their 50-ingredient house mole sauce which I had served over chicken enchiladas for main! It even contains chocolate which explains the gloriously spicy but sweet flavour that I imagine some might not be a fan of but I loved. It was just a shame I couldn't finish the generously sized portion as it was actually quite heavy. In fact I think most of the main courses were, as my friends had a similar problem - especially the two that decided to share the 'molcajete mestizo' stone bowl speciality and sadly ended up wasting half of it by the looks of things!The quality of the mains was good but I was disappointed by the starters - so that might help you with where to focus your efforts! I'm geekily fussy about topping distribution when it comes to nachos and it's fair to say they were off here (esp the cheese and sour cream). The tortilla chips didn't taste very fresh to me either, and the guac I found disappointingly bland.The servers seemed rushed off their feet with the place heaving even on a Monday eve, though our waitress was nicely efficient to start with, particularly given we were a party of 10. It's worth mentioning it's a very veggie friendly place with even a separate vegan menu upon request. The staff largely disappeared for the second half of our meal though and getting someone over to pay the bill took so long we almost walked out. I'd go back with a smaller party as I don't often find Mexican food that I like in London, and it's all quite reasonably priced. I'd know not to waste time and stomach-space on the starters either (except for maybe the stuffed jalapenos), and I'd like to try one of their tequila flights next time too!",

The chicken mole is made with 25 ingredients one of them being chocolate. I was a bit hesitant but was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. The bowls were huge and can easily feed 3 people. It's a great place for vegetarians as they have a separate menu for it. Highly recommended.",

Their signature dishes include their taco tray (pick four kinds of meat and they take care of the accoutrements) and the molcajete (Spanish word for the bowl in which it is served, basically a red or green salsa based soup filled with fajita meat and vegetables to serve into your tortillas). The tequila display is also impressive and the frozen margaritas (can be ordered individually or in pitchers) are on point.If you're looking to save a bit of money, make a reservation for one of their two Sunday brunch sittings. You serve yourself buffet style and will not be disappointed, although I highly advise also doing the aforementioned dinner experience at least once because you will miss out otherwise!",

    "text": "I'm a big fan of authentic Mexican food, and it was a great relief to find that there was somewhere else to go after El Mercado in Stoke Newington revised its menu to suit people more used to TexMex. TexMex is fine for lunch, but if I'm going for dinner I'd prefer to have a proper meal. Mestizo usually delivers on this level for me. While cuitlacoche/huitlacoche (corn fungus) is dissapointingly not on the menu, a lot of good Mole's (sauces) are, and the starters are quite good too. I can recommend the Sopa de Tortilla as a starter, which is basically a sour tomato soup served with cream and avocado with strips of tortilla. You mix it together bit by bit and eat. Delicious. The soft tacos as a starter are quite nice and there are a variety of fillings available. Molcajete is probably the principle dish on the menu, but I've not tried it yet (which looks to be very popular), but I'd definitely recommend the Mole Poblano, succulent chicken breast (boiled I think) smothered in a chocolate mole, with rice and refried beans. I have had an issue with the Mole Poblano on occasion where the standard sometimes slips and the chicken breast has been overcooked and the mole not as tasty/spicy as normal.The Mole Verde is quite tasty, but not fantastic. The desserts are very good, the Crepas de Cajeta seem to be actually made with arequipe/dulce de leche not caramel (which is quite a big bonus for me). They also offer a Sunday brunch menu which I've not yet tried, but it does include pericos aka huevos a la Mexicana which are a favourite of mine (basically scrambled eggs with spring onions, tomato, onion and chile). The location is a bit out of the way, but the restaurant itself is quite contemporary looking and modern, the service is usually decent, but not standout and sometimes a bit unfriendly. The great thing about Mestizo is the diversity of food available, I highly recommend this restaurant and indeed, I look forward to experimenting with new flavours on my future visits here. The only reason that I don't give this place 5 stars is that it offers no dishes with cuitlacoche/huitlacoche (a favourite of mine) and the quality of food and service has been known to be a bit inconsistent. Pros- diverse and authentic food- good cocktails- nicely designed restaurant (recently renovated) Cons- service can be a bit inconsistent- food can be inconsistent - bit out of the way",

When I arrived in London I came across Mestizo as our bus rounded the corner from our hotel (Ibis). Once I got back to our room I immediately searched for it and called to see if it was open and that it hadn't been a mirage. IT WAS! IT WASN'T! My fellow cohorts and I decided to have lunch there on CINCO DE MAYO! I was very surprised that the waitresses were actually from MEXICO, and that the cuisine was better than some of the so called \"Mexican\" restaurants back in Los Angeles. I had the taquitos dorados (or Flautaus) the first time. Sure they were not the biggest rolled tacos I've had, and the salsa was from a can, but it tasted fresh! The Mexican beer was a great compliment and the Flan was divine to finish of a typical dish you would find in any Mexican restaurant. Loved the decor, just not the prices (then again I was still sticker shocked as it was my first trip out of the US). But it was a small price to pay for a great \"home made\" Mexican meal. I rate this, four yummy stars only because it did not have the spice factor I was yearning for.",

We had been warned that Mexican food is not authentic in London but wanted to check that out for ourselves. Well, they were right... I noticed several people mentioned this place as the best Mexican in London, and it might be so comparatively. However, it's not authentic or tasty in general. The chips and salsa were fine, salsa ok. We ordered the red as well as the green veggie enchiladas. The servings were tiny, which is fine, that's usually the case for 'cuisine' style -but the side of black beans was literally about 3 tablespoons! The filling was cold. The tamarindo was good but it would of been nice to get a decent portion rather than a cup full of ice with a splash of tamarindo. The rice was the worst, good texture but very sour, made my teeth hurt and left an aftertaste. The service was not good, very slow, needed to ask for a drink 3 times before it was served. Too bad :(",

The selection is always changing and I've never been disappointed by anything I've tried. It's also the only place in Europe I've ever found that has dishes with the corn fungus huitlacoche, a delicious truffle-like fungus with a rich earthy flavour",

It's real Mexican with hints of South American and Spanish flavour and style. The best thing on the menu is Molcajete Mestizobeef, chicken or combination (or vegitarian), served in a stone bowl with cheese, chorizo, spring onions, cilantro and avocado and your choice of salsa roja, tomatillo, mole or chipotle. It sounds like fajitas and it is, but the mix of spices and flavour is better than any I've had (and I've had a lot). The tequila selection is huge and despite some criticism of poor service, I've never had a problem with the staff. Bottom lineMestizo is great! BTWif you like El Burrito near Goodge Street station - a take away TexMex place - you'll love Mestizothey're owned by the same people.",

Maybe it was different as the brunch is buffet based so we weren't getting served at our table, but I'd never had some of the food on offer before so needed some help. The guy on the soup / taco / fajita counter was happy to advise, he brought our food over to the table rather than make us wait at the counter, and made several personal recommendations as to what I should have next. The food - my experience of Mexican is burritos, fajitas and tacos so there was a lot of stuff here I hadn't had before and its all great. Probably the best was spinach enchilada, the black beans, or the courgette cake but I'd have it all again.

    "text": "On recommendation, and because it's close to a client's, I ventured, full of expectation, down the bleak hinterland of lower Hampstead Rd to find this restaurant. As I neared Mestizo, I saw a group of children in a nearby street throw a glass bottle into the busy road and then wait, watching for a blowout. \"Mmm... \" I thought. \"Nice neighbourhood.\" This place must be great to get people to schlepp up here. So, it turned out that although the food was good, it wasn't that good, and the service wasn't that bad - it was really bad. Let's start with the food. The quesadillas had a strangely soft and spongy texture, unlike the folded corn or wheat tortilla versions you'd probably be used to. In one of them, the mashed chicken filling was cold. Not lukewarm - cold. It was a first date, I didn't want to reveal myself as the fussy sod I am, so let it slide. Mistake #1. These soft quesadumplings were surprisingly filling, it was pretty late, so we opted to share a main - the signature Molcajete. We explained to the waiter that we were pretty full and would just share a single main course. It's more-or-less a tapas joint, anyway, so this is comme il faut. When it arrived, a half-hour later, we'd already watched, enviously, the dish brought to other tables - the large, deep stone bowl and contents receiving a warm welcome on their arrival. The reason for the half-hour wait was that the waiter, whose English was just around beginner's level, had misunderstood what we said and thought that the quesadillas were enough. Nobody, during our half-hour wait, had thought to drop by and say \"would you like something else\" or \"everything OK?\" Mildly embarrassed on discovering his mistake, the waiter ordered the dish and it arrived within five minutes. Did the waiter say \"oh, I'm really sorry - let me get you a drink. What would you like?\" You guessed it, dear reader, he didn't. We let that slide, too, both of us too eager to appear easygoing. We ate the Molcajete, but the slightly sour taste left by the nonchalant waiter had, by this time, somewhat spoiled the food itself. A note, when ordering the dish. The stone bowl is mostly made of stone, and the part that contains food is around 2/3 of a dessert-spoon deep. So, don't be disappointed. The bill eventually arrived. This was also delayed because someone else, who'd not been charged for their juice or something, had to be hauled back from the kerb to pay. For a glass of cranberry juice, a mixed fruit cocktail, two glasses of wine, four quesadillas and a bowl of stew, we paid \u00a346. I was somewhat surprised to see we'd been charged for the extra tortillas we'd needed for the Molcajete, but I realised that trying to explain why this wasn't so appropriate, in light of the rest of our dining experience, would be an utter waste of time. I'd recommend this place for diners who: a) are really too drunk to careb) are really too rich \" \" c) are really too Spanish to be misunderstood when ordering food. Try Wahaca. A friend of mine said that it's not as \"authentic\" but you'll get fed on time, I suspect and, chances are, your waiter may look you in the eye when he's taking your order.",

The location of this place is a honey trap on the way home from work, so I should wish to eat there at least once a week.... So, to Mestizo... Hmm... The food is good. I am told by more knowledgable and travelled folk that it is reasonably authentic, and the staff all appear to be of Hispanic descent. There is a good variety of Mex dishes - all your usual stuff, together with some fun sharing platters. The restuarant is lacking atmosphere, but it is nice and bright and they can seat quite a few people for its unusual location on Hampstead Road. It is actually split over two floors (not that you would know that from the street). So, I should love it, right? Problem is, to get to my beloved tacos and HUGE frozen margi I have to navigate a long wide load of attitude. You think they would be thankful for people paying well over the odds for a bean and cheese quesadilla, however it always seems to come with a side of surly. By all means try it out, but I warn you that it isn't the warmest reception whatever formation you arrive in (I've been 6+ times - work events, dinner dates, to watch the World Cup for their Mex festival). There is a severe lack of good Mexican restaurants in London, so they could easily vie for the prize, but instead they seem to be doing their best to turn people away. Gutted.",

Now i don't really put much value on the authenticity of the cuisine (as long as it tastes ok), but i decided nevertheless to give it a try. So the next day i made my friends get me here for my birthday dinner.The restaurant is located a bit off the beaten track ... about 5 minutes from Euston station. One wonders why they chose to open their business in an otherwise empty, residential area.But the location does not seem to deter customers. Even on a tuesday evening they were more than half full. The table organization at the place seemed a bit odd to me. The tables were packed closely together although there was quite a bit of empty space elsewhere in the hall.I started with the tamales. I had never tried these before ... and i guess boiled corn husk doesn't agree with me. I liked the fillings though. My friends ordered some spicy nachos and it certainly was one of the best nachos that i can remember. They had used a lot of cheese, which had made the nachos quite soggy ... just the way i like it.For the main course i had the \"Mole huasteco\". The dish comprised of chicken breast served with huasteco sauce (which tasted similar to, but better than, normal barbecue sauce) and rice and beans. This preparation was outstanding. I liked everything here ... the rice, the chicken, the beans and the sauce. Maybe it could have been a bit spicier, but i enjoyed what i got. The dish looked small, but was quite filling. The same held true for my friends' orders ... enchiladas with potato and cheese and \"chile rellenos\" (which was pepper stuffed with a variety of things, including courgette flour, corn and cheese). All the 3 main courses were came with beans and rice.A starter, a very filling main course, and a drink ... all these together cost us ~\u00a320 per person. This isn't very cheap, but you get good value for what you pay. Will be back to try some more unusual mexican dishes here.",

The food was ok \u00a0though the vegetarian offerings were more minimal than the website suggested \u00a0but the main issue was that the service was pretty surly, we had the strong impression that they resented us for not being Mexican and we got significantly worse service than anyone else there.",

    "text": "I went here recently for a friend's birthday and we all had a great time. Unlike many other Mexican restaurants the food was definately above average and had an authentic flavour. The staff were more than happy to recommend dishes and also explain the ingredients. I went for the Mole Huasteco, a traditional Mexcan chicken served with beans and rice and my friends went for the taco trays which looked delicious. Don't go to Mestizo if you've eaten well during the day because you won't have room to taste the generous portions. After our meal we ventured downstairs to the bar and continued drinking- the perfect end to my friend's birthday dinner. I don't remember too much about teh rest of teh night so I guess we had a good time!",

    "text": "I visited this place last night with a mixed group of nationalities including an American (me) and a friend from Mexico City. On the whole, a good experience, with our Mexican friend swearing it lived up to her expectations of a proper meal in Mexico City.I'll echo some earlier reviewers - this is not Cali-Mex / Tex-Mex. So, don't expect Burritos. Instead, the focus is on proper mexican mains. If I'm being honest, I've had better proper Mexican Food in North America - but by London standards, this is pretty tasty. (One exception - the Guacamole was pretty meh)I would say, that my only complaint has to do with service/attention to detail. My main was luke warm, dirty starter plates were delivered, my water glass revealed stuck on food. Again, the taste was spot on - but they could use a bit of work elevating the whole experience. I noticed several other reviewers comment on the cold food - seems like something the owners should work on.",
