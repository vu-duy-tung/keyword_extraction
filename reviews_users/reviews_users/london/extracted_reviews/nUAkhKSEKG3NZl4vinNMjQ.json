The pasta dishes are amazing. I had some sort of scallop and linguine dish. Scallops were done perfectly. The pasta was the right texture and flavorful. The pizza is also good. I'm not sure how it stacks up against other London pizzas, but there's a lot of good pizza in New York so it was less special.The desserts were as outstanding as the pasta. I tried the tiramisu and the profiteroles. Both were delicious, but also had a nice, fresh, and light texture (even though calorie-wise I'm sure it's not).",

The food is very good and there are many options, so you won't find yourself trawling through a menu only to decide on pizza - again. The monk fish is certainly worth a try. Even better than the food is the service. The staff are friendly and helpful should you ask for advice with your selection. If it's someones birthday then discreetly let the staff know and your friend will soon have the whole restaurant singing happy birthday to him/her and then will be presented with a desert from their fine selection, and a candle to blow out... Very good.",

The portion was generous, the sauce was just about right - not too watery or gravy, and the pasta itself was cooked right to the al dente stage. The restaurant is a bit out of city, still, it was packed when I visited. After the meal, I even asked for a name card so that I could refer this to friends without forgetting its name.",

It is a really good place for a quick pizza or pasta. The service is very friendly, funny, quick and the place seems to be packed all the time, even on a Sunday night at 10pm. It is one of the best Italian I know and I would recommend going there in a bigger group, it is not the best place to have a romantic t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate. The portions are huge which explains the prices, for me a main would have been enough, but I had to finish it!",

The pasta is usually very abundant and rich in taste. It usually resemble closely what you could find in Italy.2. The pizza isn't perfect, probably due to the electric oven. However it's pretty close and has good ingredients, without any excess..3. The desserts are really good, even if the tiramisu is a bit more bland than the italian counterpart it's still quite notable.4. The limoncello is also good, maybe a little too pricey but you can do it once in a while for a good one.AMBIENT AND SERVICEThe ambient feels like a good italian restaurant, and the service too. Cordial, attentive and prone to suggest you the best choice.Maybe it would be better if the tables were a bit more far away, but since I've always found it almost full I'm glad to be able to find a seat.A great place to feel almost in italy, great to have an amazing and abundant meal, without the trouble of choosing a good dish, since they are all great.",

I ordered Calamari, and asked the waiter if I could have a small bowl of Tomato sauce to use for dipping, I was told No!... I could have Mayonnaise if I wanted, I'm Italian, I've never , ever even heard of that. My wife ordered the Salmon, it contained many small and several large bones. Sometimes a bone or two slips by, but this was over the top lack of attention. I saw the table next to ours ask the waiter for some bread, the reply was, bread is not free. The waiter was totally rude to them. The couple asked for the check, paid it and left, leaving their food half eaten. They were clearly upset. I should have left as soon as I was told no sauce for Calamari. \u00a0I would never return after seeing how they provide service. And the food rates one star at best",

The Italian wait staff was friendly and recommended a couple dishes. We decided on seafood linguine, penne arribiata with grilled shrimp, mushroom pizza and a regular margarita pizza. Lemon sorbet for dessert. Everything was very good. Next time in London would definitely return.",

The restaurant itself has an old school Italian vibe to it as well as the service as well. Nothing super enthusiastic or extra friendly like how many modern places are. My fiancee and I decided to go for two pastas and went with a fettuccine alfredo dish and a tomato creamy spaghetti dish. Both of them were satisfying. Nothing truly standout but if you are in the area and want some pasta I wouldn't hesitate to drop by. Out of the two, I preferred the fettuccine alfredo dish but that may just be because I personally prefer creamy dishes. The tomato sauce dish was surprisingly a little spicy and had a nice little kick to it which was unexpected. The proportions were large and food was good so I can't complain.",

They made me a four cheese pasta with shrimp dish that was \u00a0no longer on menu because I loved the look of another yelpers posted photo. So many restaurants wouldn't do something like this and they were more than accommodating. My wife had the baked house chicken with roast potatoes and I swear this was the best chicken we've ever had. It takes 30 minutes to prepare but it comes out with the greatest crispy thin breaded crust. It was amazing. The worst part of the meal is that we couldn't really take the left overs (portions are great size) because we were staying at a hotel. The service was also the best we had in London. Whatever you do go hear for dinner but probably make reservations. We ate here after seeing the Tower of London, it's only about 10 minutes away.",

Welcome to the 80s.The tables have wipe clean table cloths and are crammed so close to our neighbours, I thought we were on a double date.The waiters are all of a charming vintage. Bedecked in wine coloured waistcoats and matching red dickie bows, they also match the table cloths! They're a bit surly, in that way people didnt care about customer reviews in the 80s, when yelp wasn't even a twinkle in it's founder's eye. To be honest its refreshing and I bet with repeat patronage you can melt away the gruff exterior. With a smiley demeanour, I definitely elicited a sneaky cheeky wink from my waitor. Let the challenge commence.They must be doing something right, at 10pm on a Friday as we are finishing up our meal, more eager customers come flooding in.It is clear they have long established regulars who have been coming here nearly as long as the waiters have worked here. The crowd was a mix of older original Londoners and younger hipper newcomers. All itching for old fashioned Italian food.The restaurant delivers a nice hearty meal. \u00a0My pasta dish was pretty good. The pizza we ate was so so but blame it on the husband who always goes for margherittas. Portions were big, my side salad was generous. The house red was a bit tasteless for my buds though. We had a nice night out. It veers on the pricey side for what it is but if in the area it's worth checking out for a bit of time travel.",

A very old school Italian atmosphere with an army of waiters running around and yelling instructions loudly. Can't get more Italian that that.Had the Milanese scalop with a side of Bolognese spaghetti. The British couple next to us gagged when they saw the size of scalop which was indeed huge. And delicious, perfectly cooked and crusted. Also had some wine but can't really remember what it is, I was letting the wheel to somebody else for once. Apparently It's a place where a lot of people bring their dates. That night the other customers were couples or large tables of friends. Be careful, even on a Saturday night they close around 11, which is a hard concept to grasp for a Parisian night owl like myself.Il Bordello can get really loud so I would not recommend going there to have intimate conversations. The food makes up for it by far though. Can't go wrong with a family business Italian restaurant.",

Then I had a spaghetti and meatball. \u00a0I wanted to keep it basic to see what they could do with it but their menu is anything but basic. \u00a0 Anyway, the pasta was perfectly cooked, to the second, and the meatballs were huge and packed with flavour. \u00a0I can't believe that we got dessert but my friend insisted and I discovered why. \u00a0 The profiteroles and tiramisu were the best I have had. \u00a0Light and not to sweet but still decadent. \u00a0What more can I say? \u00a0If this hasn't convinced you, I have failed this great restaurant. \u00a0Bravo!",

The food was hot, fresh and flavourful. \u00a0I had food envy of those all around us! \u00a0We saw lamb shoulder dishes leaving the kitchen that looked like it was going to fall off the bone.
