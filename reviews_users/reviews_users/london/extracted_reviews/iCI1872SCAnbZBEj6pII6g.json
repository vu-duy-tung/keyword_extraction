Even better when I bring my girlfriend along as the portions are so enormous that she can only finish half of hers and I get to eat her remaing portion as well. So dinner always mange to fill me up and get me belly busted taking a full on one and a half portions. I suggest trying the Chicken Katsu Curry and add an omelette on top! The ultimate combination! The restuarant is a casual sort and offer quite a cheap night out. Do try to go earlier or later than normal dinner time as there is always a queue (quite long) in front of the shop. You will be reuquired to wait for between 30-45mins depending on the crowd. As a rough gauge, dinner for 2 with drinks cost about \u00a315-20.",

It's cheap for sure and you get tons, it's almost like the Japanese noodle king (bethnal green road). I think for 3 people with a drink each was under \u00a320 which in London for satisfying food is pretty amazing. What impressed me most was the quality of the Ten Don. Usually this is quite an expensive dish, and even for somewhere in the region of \u00a36 it was good enough to go back again for. I wouldn't be against paying double for that in another restaurant. Meals starting around \u00a34.50 and going up by a few pounds, you're pretty much spoilt for choice since everything seems affordable, and looking around at other tables, everything seems to look pretty tasty too! I'd only say 4*s because it's the kind of place that you come away feeling like you've just eaten cheaply, and although I don't want to spend lots of money on every meal, you don't really come away wanting to tell people about the place.. I guess it depends, but I'll be going back in the not to distant future I'm sure!",

Why, when there are so many excellent japanese places in this part of london? The main attraction has to be the prices- standard for many of the Ramen places but exceptional when you have sushi and sashimi options, tempura and chicken in addition to the Tonkatsu set and other ramen house classics.I often go for one of the bento options- nicely presented compartmented boxes with a couple of salads, some chicken, some rice and then your option - sashimi or sushi. All the portions are big no matter what you order and the price of a main course ranges from \u00a36 for a large rice-based main course to just under \u00a39 for a big bento box. And all this just a stone's throw from Leicester Square where everything is poor quality and overpriced!So you arrive, and size up the queue. It'll take about 25 minutes to get inside. At least another 10 to order and then 10-15 for the first food to arrive. Should you wait? And it's starting to drizzle... Of course you should! You won't get better value for your money or better quality japanese food locally!",

Within the main streets of China town, in the centre of London, lies a small sized Japanese restaurant that owns queues, of customers, that end outside its door. The traditional cuisines provided such as pork kato curry, chicken teriyaki or katsudor are absolutely amazing. The menu has a trademark salad and I always wonder to myself, how do they concoct such a tasty salad cr\u00e8me? What's the recipe ? Give it to me! Another bonus is the price that is as cheap as \u00a36.50 which is a bargain considering how large the plates are for such quality foods. You definitely get your moneys worth here as well as your traditional Japanese cooking. What I would suggest is to avoid the busy hours and come in advance such as 1pm or 5pm. No matter what day it is, the food is always in demand because its dishes are 'totemo subarashii' (super duper) and you can even get take away.",

Ive been to this restaurant several times before because the food is very good value for the portion size but today I vowed that I will never go to Misato again. The staff must have some basic English yet they behave as if theyre mute, they dont seem to know the meaning of the word MANNERS as they do not greet customers and youd think theyd get shot if they were to manage a smile and a hello, instead they can just about mumble How many? as they point to the table. When you order theyre not attentive, the waitress today didnt have the common sense to think that as there were 2 of us that wed both want drinks, so several minutes after my partner got his drink, I brought this issue to her attention and she just rolled her eyes, didnt apologise and then just dumped the drink infront of me. Then when my partner had just about finished his meal the waitress quickly grabbed his plate away before he barely had the chance to put his chopsticks down! Keep in mind this wasnt peak time, it was mid afternoon and there wasnt the usual long queue and lack of seats. Then to top it all off, when the bill came the waitress gave us the wrong change and when we approached her about it she just slapped it onto my hand, again no apology, no thank you, no goodbye etc etc. If the staff were somewhat nice then I may have just left them the 5 Pounds as a tip but theyre not even worthy of 1p!!! If youd like to experience the epitome of WORST STAFF SERVICE then by all means go to Misato, otherwise spare yourself the misery and go elsewhere.",

Being still hungry and, having originally been dead set on a giant, juicy plate of Singapore noodles, I found myself lost in a sea of unfamiliar Chinatown eateries, casinos and unorthodox revellers. It took me a few moments to collect my thoughts, but then I remembered: what about that tiny Japanese place that I had read about somewhere on the social media train? Always a queue, I had heard. But maybe at 9pm on a Sunday, there might just be a free spot for one.Walking down towards Leicester Square, I kept looking out for Misato as I thought I'd missed it, but stopped in time. Menus printed on A4 paper and placed inside plastic wallets in the window. A spot visible through said window! I went in and after a quick look at the menu, instantly ordered a can of Sapporo beer, some miso soup and a katsu curry.The soup was warm and comforting, and the curry just giant. The portion size was reminiscent of dishes I'd cook up during my student days. Two breaded cutlets of pork slathered in Japanese curry sauce, with a dressed salad and an extremely generous heap of sticky rice. All were pleasing to this ravenous kid recharging his batteries after a hectic weekend.The bill? \u00a311.50 including tip. Some may baulk at the 'optional service charge' suggested at the foot of the bill. I've read many a review shrieking about waiters asking for tips and customers refusing through their rigorous, dogmatic obligation to take offence wherever humanly possible, but let's be honest, these are people earning tuppence trying their luck. So what? I paid it anyway and left.Five stars. Will be back with a friend next time.",

I wish that was an exaggeration. I decided when I was in London I'd grab a quick dinner before seeing Book of Mormon, and with this restaurant being just around the corner, and with takeaway being an option, I decided to go for some chicken teriyaki. The restaurant inside isn't very big, but it was relatively full. The menu offers little but I've often found that menus who offer little do what they do best. Unfortunately this wasn't the case here. I didn't wait very long for my food, and when I got it I went and sat in Leicester square to people watch as I ate. The chicken was cooked, but that's probably the best thing I can say about it. It was alright, but I probably wouldn't go back. The teriyaki sauce wasn't very sweet, but the rice was nice and fluffy, so I suppose there's positives and negatives. Alright if you're in a rush, but I wouldn't return for a sit down meal.

    "text": "Finding this place is exactly why I use Yelp. Having moved offices to the area, we've all been looking for new and better places to eat. A couple of us had a hankering for proper Japanese katsu curry (and not the cheap mess you get from the likes of Wasabi), so we asked Yelp. Most of the top reviews paid homage to Misato's katsu curry, and it did not disappoint. I took away 4 (four!) containers for \u00a36, which made up the salad, rice, sauce, and chicken. It was great that it was separated as you could mix it as you like; the chicken wasn't soggy by the time you got back to the office so retained that amazing crunch from the coating. The sauce was a little sweeter than I expected, but I can't complain as all katsu curry is different depending on where you try; and I'd thoroughly recommend you try this one.I didn't sit down at the restaurant itself but it was busy, with a great atmosphere, and very friendly staff. It seemed small but bustling, in a good way, and pleasantly decorated. I did miss the entrance going past as there is nothing more than a piece of paper in the window, but once you're in, you're set for great katsu. We were most pleased!",

    "text": "Misato is a casual Japanese restaurant in China Town, it is a very popular venue for the Far East students in London as it is known for its very affordable price and massive portions. It is perhaps one of the cheapest Japanese restaurants in London if you excluded the likes of Itsu and Wasbi. While far from top notch, the pork katsu curry here is solid, very smooth and consistent in texture, plenty of mild sweetness and spiciness. Don't order starters or side dishes unless you are a big eater as the portions here are almost twice as much as most other restaurants nearby.",

Delicious, and with salpico, the typical refreshing juice they usually have in Japanese summer you pay like 10 pounds for a meal including service. I do not think there is a better option, although I would avoid if you get stressed with queuing and are going to be meeting people at the restaurant. I would suggest you meet somewhere else before going to the restaurant, since they do not allow you to sit down while waiting for other people. Everyone needs to be there. I do not mind, since it is a minor price to be paid given all the pros.",

    "text": "I was with a friend attempting to try Shake Shack. Put off by the horrendous airport check-in queue, we decided to head to Chinatown at her request to try a small Japanese place she'd heard good things about.Thus we found ourselves at Misato, a tiny Japanese cafe looking place with nary any indication it was a shop, apart from the A4 piece of paper in the window showing the name of the place. This in no way hinted how amazing the food would be once inside.There was a small queue when we arrived, around 8-10 people and seeing the size of the place, we expected to have to wait ages. Luckily!, as we arrived, a table opened up for 2 people and we were shooed right in. So get this, if you want a table quickly, go in small groups of 2. Otherwise like the unfortunate people with 3 or more in their party, there is a long wait due to the limited number of group tables. As we ate during that 45 mins, the queue only got LONGER.The food itself is brilliant on two levels. First, the value for money is astounding. The Unagi Nigiri (That's the Sushi wraped in Eel) which is normally a little pricy in other places was \u00a32 for 2 pieces of reasonable size. 6 pieces of sushi ranges from \u00a33-6 from California rolls to salmon. My jaw dropped. Not to mention the main dishes were served in giant portions for \u00a34-9. Katsu curry, Bento boxes...I cannot fault the value here.So a place that does cheap sushi probably tastes cheap too right? Wrong. I've eaten in quite a few sushi places of varying quality and I can honestly say this place serves the most tasty sushi in the whole of london. It wasn't bland, dry, nor too cold, plus had the right amount of vinegar in the rice, good amounts of filling and the Unagi Nigiri was so succulent...and the california rolls to die for. I just don't know how they do it. My main arrived, the Chicken Teriyaki and again, lettuce smothered in delicious mayonaise (I think Kewpie) a mass of real breaded chicken, big rice portion and again, delcious Teriyaki sauce. I'm just salivating thinking about this meal.For sure I'll be back, and will be in a group smaller that too. I mean the important thing is that I get in. And once in, I shall feast like a king on a budget.Seriously, if you're in Chinatown and in a small group. At the risk of making this place even more popular that it already is, consider Japanese. Consider Misato. Just look out for the A4 piece of paper in the Window and no actual name where you'd expect a shop name to be :)",

This place definitely caters to the former.A couple friends and I came here on a Friday night and the place was packed. Thankfully we only had to wait about 5-10 minutes before being seated. They also hand you the menus to look over in line, so we ordered pretty much right after we got seated. I wanted something light so I ordered the Tofu Steak (grilled tofu & sauce, w/ salad) and asked for the salad dressing on the side. When the dish came out I was already a bit disappointed. Not to be picky, but they didn't remember to put the dressing on the side. Ok, fine. Whatever. Maybe the dressing will actually taste good? Unfortunately not the case, as it tasted super watery. The dish also came with a mysterious brown sauce (which I assume was for the tofu). Curious, I dipped my chopsticks in and gave it a taste. It literally tasted like diluted soy sauce. Not a fan. By this point I had pretty much given up, so I was actually pleasantly surprised when I tasted the grilled tofu since it was decent, although - again, this seems like a trend but - watery. Nothing special to say about the salad either - I mean, what can you really say about lettuce and a tomato?Overall I was not impressed. The service was fast and I appreciated that they constantly made sure our water glasses were filled, but honestly the food was so subpar I can't even justify the incredibly low prices (mine was 4 pounds). I wanted to love it, because it would've meant good food for low prices - which is definitely a struggle in London - but I just couldn't. I will not be returning.",

Although you do not usually have to wait more than 15/20 minutes.Do not expect the nicest place ever, though, this is not about style, this is about real food and the restaurant could have easily gotten a new look one decade ago. The toilets are clean, but damn, I guess you better wait a bit and use the loo somewhere else where you do not get oil de parfum just by going downstairs.The main dishes are great, but I would recommend you a bento box with a bit of sushi and a bit of rice with meat or fish, they are just delicious (and the best option if you can't decide!).",

The fish was very fresh and was set out simply and very humbly.

I did not care especially for the quality of the chicken in our dish (very fatty, etc.) and the sushi was acceptable yet plain. Our experience was really hampered by the service. We waited about 25 minutes for our order to be taken although food did come out quickly after that. Once we finished our meal I was still a bit hungry and wanted a second roll as well as a beer. The language barrier was so thick between the staff and myself I ended up receiving no roll and all and a second person coming around to inquire about the beer since the first person forgot to ask which I wanted. On top of all of this, my communication with the staff was very rudely conducted over the heads of the guests next to us since the tables are oriented against one another. The in my opinion the only redeeming quality of this restaurant is the fantastic volume of food you receive for only a few pounds.",

Service is quick and snappy and knows how to run a restaurant. While I was hoping for more variety in their house salad, the lettuce is wonderfully crisp and the mayonnaise and curry sauce pair well together.A more proper rating would be 4.5, with a deduction for the salad plainness, I will round up for the price.",

It seems a japanese restaurant run by chinese people in the middle of ChinaTown. But because of the great reviews on yelp (especially coming from Hannah, Jing and Katie) I still wanted to give it a shot, and I'm glad I did it!Come here around 9.30 on a Sunday, and there was still a queue, but... how can I say.. they have the typical asian attitude combined with Londonese hurry, let's say the you won't wait a lot in queue!No experimentation in the menu, mixed sushi, some bento boxes and a bunch of hot dishes like chicken and pork Katsu. Stop. Awesome, the only thing I usually hate from asian restaurants (it's a problem I saw in several of them, thai, chinese, japanese, you name it) is the size of the menus. And the lower the quality, the bigger the menu! We ordered sushi, sashimi, and chicken katsu. Now, it must be said that the quality per se of the food is not excellent, but if you compare the quality of the food for the prize that's where it gets the 5 stars!Now, on my personal list this actually got two different grades, a 4 stars for the sushi \u00a0(good, but that's it) and an awesome 5-stars for the katsu, so.. if you want a quick and big portion of katsu don't look further, otherwise you can still consider it as an option but nothing more than that. Unfortunately the service is... a bit rushy! yes they are going to bring the menu while you are still in queue, yes they are going to to ask for ordering while still in queue, but you know, it's central london, I ckind of understand that!",

Misato serves the usual homestyle Japanese/Korean food including katsu curries, bentos and noodles, but for a price that is extremely reasonable. There are definitely better quality restaurants serving this kind of food all around the West End (Tokyo Diner comes to mind), but few other places do it for as cheap or as quick. Service is bare bones, but its mostly what you can expect in Chinatown and at this price point. The place fills up quickly on evenings with tourists and the student crowd from Asia, so be prepared to wait in line if you don't come early!",

There are almost always queues out of the door and the service reflects this with an emphasis on speed often making it a little brusque. They also won't let you sit down until your whole party has arrived so no sneaky queue tactics. I usually go for a bento box as they are excellent value and provide a bit of variety so you don't have to choose between sushi and a full meal. Not only are the portions massive but the food is also pretty good. Most people are young and pretty cool and you get the impression that they're all also regulars.

I ordered a Sushi bento and was enough naive to add a small bowl of rice... I seriously had some trouble finishing it! The food is very good and, having been in Japan, really authentic. They use wasabi in the sushi rice and this little detail tells a lot about how really japanese this place is. It's difficult to spend more than 15\u00a3 because people cannot understand how cheap this restaurant is until they go and eat there.

Pretty basic and no-frills, but at that price, I don't give a damn.Yakitori starters, followed by sushi and sashimi starters, with plenty of Japanese beer were very enjoyable indeed. Seemed to be a lot of students there, which reinforces the cost-effectiveness aspect. I don't understand comments from other Qypers who mentioned rude staff. Japanese people do not do rude.

That's mostly because whenever I'm around in Chinatown I don't usually have a Japanese meal in mind (even though I love it). But yesterday I was out with some budget-conscious, sushi-loving friends and we decided to give it a try. It was past 9pm so there was no queue. The local itself is small and rather plain, doesn't look pretty or anything. But it's not the wrapping, but the gift itself, so... The staff were very polite and took our orders quickly. The food came in giant plates. I had Tendon (tempura veggies and prawns over a bed of rice and a side salad) and was quite good. The bento box the girl next to me had was the biggest I've seen in London.I wouldn't classify this as gourmet food, but it wasn't bad at all, either. Very good price/quality ratio, specially considering it's Japanese food, which tends to be on the pricier end of the spectrum. We spent about \u00a310 each and were really satisfied!I'll probably come back some time again :)P.S. It's cash only, so remember to bring some before going in (there's an HSBC nearby on Gerrard St).",

I've had much much better versions of the few dishes I had here (I had the katsu, pork ginger, popcorn chicken (though it was not called this--I forgot what the actual name was)). I am willing to give this place another try, however, as the sushi looks very good. If you are from the SoCal area, I'd just pass on this place, if I were you. If you are a local, this restaurant might good to go to if you happen to be in the area.",

    "text": "Are you a student? Are you broke? Are you always hungry? Do you always complain about portion sizes and prices?COME HERE FOR A \u00a34.50 CHICKEN DINNER!!!I love this place so much like this place fulfills all of my needs. I can get CHEAP and YUMMY JAPANESE FOOD and BE FULL and NOT BROKE!!! That is pretty much all you need to know. But if you want to know more, they have quite an extensive menu and everything is considerably cheaper than other establishments considering how expensive London is! Like, this place is cheaper than McDonald's, LOL. I have a relatively big appetite and I'll admit, even though I finish all of my food here, I could still definitely eat more. But the important thing is that I won't be hungry here, I don't get bloated but I am full! At a great cost! The place is quite \"hidden\" but it's worth the search! It's along the right side of entering Chinatown from Shaftesbury. Food comes out super quick and even though there's a mandatory 10% service charge, it's still well worth it. I have had their Zaru Soba, Tori Karaage Rice, Tori Teriyaki Rice, and Tonkatsu Curry Rice! Curry Katsu is more expensive, it's like \u00a36.50 but it's still way cheaper than elsewhere. Also, all of the rice comes with a side salad which is AWESOME and wow...their cherry tomatoes? Only one, but so refreshing and awesome from all of the heavy comfort food. Nice touch. Okay, so you definitely can't beat value. Taste wise, it is also super good. Their wasabi is really weak though, which surprised me. But, that's pretty minor. I probably wouldn't recommend ordering the Zaru Soba (\u00a35.00) since it isn't really filling but it's a solid tasting dish (dipping sauce could be better). Tori Teriyaki Rice was REALLY good though, their chicken is crisp on the outside and super moist and juicy on the inside. They cook their chicken really well! The teriyaki sauce was also fantastic, just enough sauce and subtly sweet. Same goes for the Tori Karaage, which was battered perfectly! Outside had a nice crunch and was crisp while the inside still remained juicy and succulent. The rice is also amazing too, like it's nice and sticky and short grained!!! Great texture and taste, it is seriously some good rice. Tonkatsu Curry was \u00a0pretty good, but the meat itself was lean at parts. But when you eat the fatty parts...YUM. It was nicely battered and crisp with your standard curry, which was pretty good. I wish they gave you more curry though, since portions are massive LOL. Food tastes essentially like japanese comfort food, and everything is really well cooked! You really can't beat the price and the quality of the food.Portions are bigger than a human head and you will definitely be full and happy here! They don't skimp on ingredients and the food is really well cooked, despite how constantly busy this place is! There's always lines at your standard dinner/lunch time so if you're not looking to wait, try to come a little later or earlier than the typical meal time. However, the wait wouldn't be really long and they're super efficient and quick. Their take out is also fantastic, great packaging (they use plastic tupperwares and it pleases me greatly) and portions still!!! Anytime I'm in London and hungry, this is the place I ALWAYS go to. I brought my friend from Nagoya to eat here and she loved it and I quote, \"it tastes like I'm eating real Japanese food back in Japan!\". So, I guess this place is pretty authentic too, LOL. Also, MAKE SURE YOU BRING CASH! This place is cash only!I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!",

Curry is okay and I would not order any of the soups again. Although I have to say they don't taste like full of sugar or salt as usually in other restaurants that are considered to have better seasoning in their food. Their drinks are quite fun, you can get some stuff that is a bit different than anywhere else and are cheap as well.So if you are in the area, quite hungry but angry at the society for pricing other ramens around 10 quid a portion, this is a great place to go to.",

If you are at the M&M emporium, it's across the street, quite small and could be hard to miss. I've only ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry because it's such a great deal. I would highly suggest going to Misato for lunch, as you'll surely be filled till the next day. My friend ordered their soba noodles which looked fine as well, just not as much food if you're looking for quantity.My only slight complaint is they add a strange gratuity or tax? I wasn't sure, and no one at the cashier explained it well so I just paid. Overall, this place is so inexpensive it really doesn't matter much. The service wasn't the most attentive, so you may have to call someone over to your table a few times. This place is quite popular but small, even when my group went for a meal at 4pm.",

    "text": "Once upon a time there was a student studying for hours in Senate House Library. It became very late and she became very hungry, suddenly craving Japanese food for dinner. Using her trusty Yelp app she found a place called \"Misato\" that was not very far so she walked to Chinatown to go eat there. And the rest is history. Seriously tasty food and shockingly inexpensive! The katsu curry is absolutely perfect in portion and flavour, very authentic (even the little salad that comes with it!). I could literally rave about the breading on the pork cutlet for days. I was so hungry when I got here but I left extremely full and satisfied. I also ordered cucumber maki sushi as a side and that was also wonderful. 6 pieces for only \u00a32.50! I would come back here just for the sushi alone.Came here after the dinner rush so there was no queue and got a seat immediately. Despite the dinner rush being over all the tables were full so it took a little bit of time for the food to finally arrive. Also, I'm pretty sure I saw a sign that said cash only so bare that in mind! This is now my \"go-to\" place in London for Japanese food. Especially considering the hit or miss of the surrounding places in Chinatown, you can't beat the prices or the quality of Misato.",

First of all, i know some people noted the place didn't look like a million dollar or went simple with decorations etc \u00a0but come on, that's the point. If you want to lower the prices, that's first thing you cut. And i'd rather they don't do cuts on the quality of the food.We came quite early in the evening so we didn't queue. The staff was nice and efficient. We were served fast which happened to be extremely convenient for we were starving. We ordered sushi makis, sashimi and a Tori Soba for me (soup noodles dish with fried chicken).I was surprised the makis were as good as the ones i'm used to at my favourite Japanese place at home. The sashimi were a generous portion of thick cut salmon. All these dishes were really cheap (6 makis starts at \u00a32).The Tori Soba wasn't exceptional but the chicken was reaaaally well cooked. I regretted not taking the curry udon. All in all i was satisfied and i'd happily return to try out more things. Note that it's not your full-on traditional japanese food restaurant.",

This is what Yelp is all about: finding a hidden gem that you would never hear of otherwise, and supporting a local business too. This place can best be described as \"cheap and cheerful\", like a Japanese greasy spoon. Generally a young student-age crowd due to the incredibly low prices. It was \u00a33.50 for six piece salmon and avocado rolls, which actually tasted super fresh and were generously portioned. The huuuuge pork Katsu curry plate came with large spoonfuls of Japanese rice, a big portion of meat and a small dressed salad, all for \u00a35.50. Service is quick and impersonal, but tap water refills come free and often. Expect a wait at dinner time of around 10-15 minutes, which you'll spend lined up in the narrow entrance hallway. But it's well worth it for a filling, tasty, and cheap Japanese meal. Looking forward to trying the udon next time!",

The place is kind of hard to spot, as it's a small door squished between some larger establishments. It is in the \"heart\" of Chinatown, but like aaaall the way down the street. The interior is pretty humble and simple. At around 7:45 on a Wednesday night, it was still quite packed and I waited for about 15 minutes before being seated. I ordered the curry pork katsu-don as soon as I sat down, because that's what I was craving, so didn't even look at the menu. (The server was like \"... LOL ok????\")It took some time but wow, the portions are indeed very large. I usually eat a TON for someone my size and rarely find things filling enough that I can't find room for dessert, but that's exactly what happened! It was so good that I wiped my place clean. The pork cutlet itself was not as thin as I expected, but it wasn't the most tender, either. Granted, you do get quite more than what you pay for. A small downside is that the curry seemed a little cold... maybe because it was mixing with the salad? Everything was running together, but that was understandable.Overall, good place to drop by if you're on a budget! Heads up that it is cash only.",

Donburis (less of a rice bowl, more of a rice plate because it's too much to fit in a bowl with the salad, meat and rice). The bento boxes are good but if you go to Misato and want to get your money's worth and feel full and satisfied go with donburis. Bentos are like \u00a311(?) Donburi's like Gyudons cost \u00a36.50 and go up from that. Ramen is alright, nothing really that authentic IMO, broth is clear but meat is lacking when it comes to the ramens, and I wouldn't recommend getting udons as your noodles. Staff is an it overworked (dropped a piece of tonkatsu as they brought out my dish) but they're still polite if you're not a total poo towards them. The place is quite small and so you'll share tables unless you're lucky. And the place is cash-only as I recall. Drinks are a bit overpriced, ramune drinks (carbonated soda that tastes like lemonade but with a marble inside that reminds me and every east-Asian whether Chinese/Japanese/Koreans of their childhood).",

The beef was so shredded that it looked like it was the left over bits. The texture was really weird and tasted strange. \u00a0I did not enjoy it at all. Also the soup was much too salty. \u00a0I then had to ask several times for the bill. \u00a0After the third time, it finally came. \u00a0When I went to pay, I gave them enough to pay for the meal without the service charge and the girl who had just returned from her break, asked if everything was ok, and I said not really, although the sushi was good. I have never had a bad Japanese meal, even very cheap ones, so the experience here was very disappointing. \u00a0A pity.",

We ordered nigiri (they called it something else on the menu but this what we call it in the States) and the rice was cold and chewy. They were pulling it from a fridge and plopping some raw fish on top. It was cheap, sure, so I suppose you get what you pay for. Not mad about it, but would have def gone somewhere else for sushi and paid top dollar for legit nigiri. I think you're better off going elsewhere for a few bucks more.",

I just love the hole-in-the-wall-ness and the fact that everyone piling in is there for the good eats. I find that in these cases, everyone queues nicely, politely. You sit, order, eat, pay, and clear out because you know there are people waiting for your seats. There's no pretence, it is exactly what you see, and the event of sit-order-eat-pay repeats itself hundreds of times a night. The servers know their roles inside out, and everything runs like clockwork. I had katsu curry and rice, although their bentos looked good too. \u00a0Food was hearty and tasty.

Japanese inspired cuisine, with HUGE portions and really low prices.The menu is quite wide, rice based dishes, sushi, sashimi, rolls, curries... There are vegetarian/vegan options. Just so you have an idea of how big the portions are, please check the photos.The tofu balls filled with rice, are absolutely spectacular, sweet tofu and well cooked rice on the inside (but really filling beware), and the tofu steak rice is also amazing, it comes with a generous amount of white rice, an amazing sauce in the middle and grilled tofu with a big side salad. The dressing is mayonnaise based, so if you are vegan please ask for this to be aside.My friends have ordered Katsu Curry more than once and the amount of chicken is ridiculous, I will say this again, I hope you are hungry when you get there!Cheap, good, filling. My favourite 3 words when it comes to a restaurant :)",

Ordered takeaway to take back to my office last night (sad I know...) and was happy with the price, but not that happy with how long it took. The Katsudon was ready and bagged and happily steaming away inside it's cellophane wrapped bowl, but the sushi was nowhere to be seen. It was only 10-12 minutes later that the sushi roll turned up.However, the food was good, a good amount of wasabi was provided as well as a bowl for mixing and dipping (rare!). The egg in the donburi had cooked maybe a tad more than I had wanted and there wasn't quite enough 'stuff' to go with the rice, but it was a good meal.I'll head there again for takeout as it was some good food. But I'll make sure that I order just one dish at a time. Warning if you're getting takeout, there is a chair but you'll be bumped every time someone walks past (which happens often). Standing is an option but there really isn't a place to wait.",

Come hungry, with cash, and be prepared to wait for just a short while, maybe 15 minutes. There are many tables and they move quickly but it is very popular, for good reason! Order some tempura for the table and crack open an Asahi Super Dry, or a ramune for the kids. Then enjoy your plate of crispy katsu drowned in curry, or your hearty bowl of udon or soba.

    "text": "Honest review from going to this place for over 6 years.Food:The is generally quite enjoyable with a good variety of Japanese style dishes, although the authenticity of the restaurant I wouldn't say is high, some dishes have their own more unique taste, rather than authenticity Japanese. I suggest dishes with teriyaki sauce, although abit sweet. Ramen/Udon dishes are also a solid option, the sushi tends to be abit dry but overall good. Quite cheap, dishes costing generally \u00a34.50-\u00a37 for mains, \u00a32-\u00a35 for sides.Atmosphere/Facilities:The restaurant is often quite busy, more so on evenings during Thursday-Sunday. In the summer the restaurant tends to get quite hot and humid if you need to sit more deeper inside the restaurant, I recommend trying to get a table near the entrance during the summer. The restaurant appearance of the restaurant is dated and would benefit from a refresh such as making all the walls more brighter and the tables/chairs being updated. The toilet is downstairs that could also do with the same treatment as it's quite dark the locks on the doors aren't strong/stableStaff: The are generally friendly, some more talkative than others, but always at least polite. The staff can often be busy so you may need to wait to get service. I would say the more polite staff is the male cashier.Overall Misato is a cheap spot in Chinatown you get what you pay for, good taste, although not highly authentic, nevertheless give it a shot, you may enjoy it like I have over the years",

Salad, chicken with homemade teriyaki sauce and white rice. Salmon and Tuna roll ~$4 for 8 -10 pieces of delicious fresh fish! The restaurant is very small, around 11 tables, expect a 30 minute line at all times. The bathroom isn't the cleanest but good enough. I will keep coming back! Cheers!!",

I ordered the following:- Curry beef udonThe curry arrived with a neat mound of curry paste in the centre of the bowl which needed to be stirred in which I thought was a nice touch. I like dishes that are left incomplete to encourage an interaction with your plate for the added sense of freshness and satisfaction that you have in some small way contributed to your meal. The taste however was a little sweet for me with nowhere near the amount of savouriness it needed. The half boiled egg it arrives with was also boiled a minute or two too long resulting in no added creaminess which could have helped.The beef slices were tender and the noodles also nicely spongy however so it does have some redeeming features. The staff were also fast and efficient so I may come back in future (perhaps in another few years!).",

The restaurant is small and I wouldn't consider the food top quality but people come here for a no frills dining experience - everyone knows the drill, which is to order, eat, pay and leave because you know there's always people waiting. I came here with a friend on a Friday night and only had to wait a couple minutes. The staff aren't the friendliest but they're definitely efficient. My friend and I got the chicken katsu curry. First thing I noticed was the portion size - it was huge! There were about ten strips of chicken next to a heaping pile of rice and some side salad. The chicken katsu was crispy and juicy, and the curry sauce was so flavorful, it tasted like it had been cooking overnight. I was so content after my meal and the best part is, it only costed me \u00a37!Misato will become my go-to spot. Definitely come here if you're in the area and craving some fast and easy Japanese food.",

The lady eating next to me raved about her order and said its her favourite meal and she eats it every week. The Chicken katsu curry was massive but also not very nice. Chicken was brown, very fatty and heavily breaded with a very thick sauce that we didn't love. Portion size is huge, it could easily feed two people and yes it's very cheap. But I'd rather have nice/food. Maki rolls are ok, just plain nothing amazing. They don't do hand rolls which I was really craving. For such cheap prices i wouldn't except the meat or fish to be of any good quality which put me off. Side note, the staff were amazing, incredibly nice and helpful. My 5 year old left his museum map on the table and started crying 5 minutes after we left when he realised he forgot it. We ran back and they fished it out of the bins for us even though they were so busy. Very nice people!",

    "text": "Having lived the better part of the past six years of my life in Japan, I was looking forward to enjoying some familiar favourites at the highly rated Misato. What I got instead was a confusing derivative loosely based on Japanese food.Our party of three overzealously ordered enough food to feed five people from the lackadaisical staff who only acknowledged us when we drew their attention. The portions were quite generous, despite the fact that half of the large plates were taken up by shredded lettuce slathered in dressing. The katsudon with its bland, overcooked egg, lacked any type of onions, was not cooked with the pork cutlet and was served on a plate instead of a bowl (the \"don\" in \"katsudon\").The katsu curry was edible, but the pork was dry and the curry sauce was quite sour and definitely not the same slightly sweet flavour of a Japanese style curry.The pork and ginger rice dish was passable, approximating the flavour of the sauce well, but the preparation of the pork seemed very lazy. The slices of meat were far too thick and rigid.Perhaps the most offending item was the tori karaage, which was a disastrous, soggy, greasy mess of overcooked meat.Fortunately there were several dishes that helped save the experience. The tempura was acceptable and the tofu steak was enjoyable, though you have to question the difficulty of lightly frying a piece of tofu.Perhaps I am being a little harsh, as the generous portions meant that we all left with very full stomachs, and this kind of food is perfect for a quick, cheap and filling meal for lunch. However, if you're looking for a Japanese food experience, look elsewhere, because while this was a very filling meal, it was also a very unfulfilling experience.",

    "text": "A good evening is generally accompanied by food, or at least that's the rule my friends and I abide by. Slight issue was money - neither of us had much. So cheap and cheerful was the brief. And Misato was the solution. I met my Korean/ NYC friend, Crystal (great name huh?) outside and I have to admit, during the couple of minutes I'd had sneaking a peek at the menu before she arrived, I wasn't too keen. Although I love Japanese food, I'm more keen on the sushi and the rolls as opposed to the big udon soups and noodle dishes. And whilst I have a special spot for Katsu, I associate it with Wagamama's and therefore only eat it there (yes, yes, ridiculous, i KNOW). However, I jumped in and opted for the Tempura with rice. whilst Crystal opted for the Katsu with egg sauce. Tempura was standard and for the price, decent enough. What caught my attention though was the egg sauce on the Katsu. Firstly, egg sauce just sounds wrong and this wobbly, semi solid 'mess' looked absolutely rank if I'm being honest. I eventually plucked up the courage to sample a bit of the gelatinous, globby gloop and to my surprise, if you can get over the weirdness of, it's actually pretty tasty. Service was quick and efficient and the lychee juice was the perfect option for a sticky evening. Bill came to just under \u00a320 for a giant meal and drinks (1 beer, 1 lychee juice) and yes, I'd def go there again for something cheap, casual and easy (sounds a bit like a description of some tacky pick-up joint...)",

    "text": "If you like Wagamama and fancy bigger portions for a lower price then Misato is the place for you. Having said that, apart from the menu, the two couldn't be any more different. Misato is a tiny little Japanese restaurant, only slightly longer than it is wide, hidden away on Whitcomb St, right next to Leicester Square. It is instantly recognisable in that there is nearly always a queue which often stretches out onto the pavement, past the shop front and blocking the doors of its neighbours. If you weren't looking for it, you'd miss it. The menu is varied, from sushi and bento to katsu curry, and it all looks great. The portions are big and unless you're very hungry you're unlikely to polish off a whole curry as the volume is simply overwhelming. Some of the dishes are a little too salty for me but for the price you pay, which can be as low as \u00a35-6 a plate, it doesn't hurt much. The staff are great, but unless you go when it is a bit quieter, it can occasionally feel like they are rushing you out to get the next customers in, and with the restaurant seating maybe only 40 at a time, it can take a while to get to the front of the queue, but I would advise anyone to stick it out. My only other criticism is that it does get very hot in there sometimes due to the lack of air conditioning, but hey, good food, cheap and cheerful with a great atmosphere. As long as you brought good company, you're in for a lovely time, and a filling meal. (I've also updated the info to reflect its actual location on Whitcomb St, not Wardour St!)",

I was a bit disappointed that they could not prepare the udon noodle soups for takeaway - but perhaps that gives me a reason to go back! Instead, I had the chicken katsu bento and it was delicious. I particularly enjoyed the small portion of seaweed salad (wish there were more of it included). It's reasonably priced and the food is good.

The line from the hostess extended down to the steps outside. We were waiting for about 15 minutes I believe. All I remember was being so hungry but for some reason I remained patient. I ordered the tofu steak which came with white rice and salad. I also ordered a miso soup to warm up from the cold. Food was incredible! What made it even better were the HUGE portions. You receive a plentiful and you'll definitely satisfy your hunger. I will definitely come back. Probably for lunch on a weekday next time so it's not so crowded.",

Not amazing, but not half bad.This is a real student joint. Not date material unless your date is sixteen. Unless you're sixteen too, I'd say the whole thing is a bad idea and you should probably just stay home. But if you're a student or low-budget and dating someone age-appropriate go for it.",

You will be amazed when you see how long the queue is during lunch and dinner time. Don't go in a big group because it would take you forever for a table as the restaurant itself is tiny.Nonetheless, the portion is HUGE at Misato in comparison to other Japanese restaurants in London. I love their Curry Katsu Rice and Terriyaki Chicken Rice, they do good Tempura Udon as well. However, the sushi sets aren't the best food that they serve! Hot dishes like noodles and rice, are better quality-guaranteed compared to the cold dishes, e.g. sushi.Anyway Misato is a good economic-choice if you want to spend less for some promising authentic Japanese food.",

But if you're looking for extremely yummy food that's cheap and comes in big portions, then this is your place! Came here on a Saturday afternoon and there was a Queue outside the door already. Luckily, it was a sunny day and we only had to wait for about 15 Minutes until we were seated.The restaurant is fairly small and has no decoration or anything that might entice you to take your time while having your food. However, I felt that it's part of the charm - basic wooden tables and chairs, crammed together to seat as many people as possible. The waiters seem a bit stressed and rather reserved, but friendly. There's a really big selection of Katsu Curry dishes and nice Bento Boxes, as well as Sushi and Udon. I had the Salmon Teriyaki Bento and he had the Chicken Katsu Curry. My bento box was big, with a more than generous piece of juicy, perfectly cooked Salmon, a big serving of rice, salad, to makis as well as two pieces of fried pork and a seaweed salad. His chicken Katsu portion was ginormous (yes, that is totally a word) and could have fed two people. The food is really tasty and it's great value for money. Is the food worth the Queuing-outside-the-door? Yeah, I'd say it is - as long as you don't expect an amazingly unique dining experience, but really solid, tasty Japanese staple food.Will definitely go here again!",

Does long line = good? That was our mission. Luckily, while waiting in line, we got a good look at the food. I pressed my face against the glass, steaming it up, and stared down the food as it passed into unsuspecting customers.The tuna had an off-color. Not good. The soba arrived wilted and sad. It wasn't even on a bamboo plate. Not good. OK, I thought, can you really \"see\" unpalatable-ness? Maybe it will taste good.As we progressed in our line, we got a good view of the cashier's area. In the area was where they apparently prepared drinks. I saw filthy water cups washed by simply wiping them with rags. The large novelty sake bottles were re-filled from sake-in-a-box. They also prepared some other concoction by mixing instant powder.I suppose this might be part and parcel of any restaurant operation, but it was disconcerting seeing them do it so nonchalantly in front of customers.The food. I ordered sashimi. The salmon wasn't bad but the tuna was. It felt like someone had defrosted it. My friend ordered tonkatsu rice...Now imagine, if you will, that there exists a planet beyond our solar system made entirely of eggs. Suppose the inhabitants crafted a ship and landed it on your tonkatsu. That's what happened. A huge UFO of an egg was plopped onto the tonkatsu. Really? The breading on the tonkatsu was far too thick. The worst part is I could TASTE fish oil in the breading. In other words, they probably have a huge vat of oil and just throw everything in it. Yuck.Yes, it was cheap. But would you pay even a cent for crap?",

But the food is outstanding, the portions are large, they come quickly and the price is great. The food is also very nicely presented in traditional Bento style. I had the curried pork steak yesterday, with rice and salad. It was so tasty I almost miaoed. Yes, it was that good. On the other hand, it was probably not the wisest thing to eat on such a warm day when there was a lack of air conditioning.Anyway, the food (the curries and noodles especially) and the service are excellent. I highly recommend visiting Misato when you're next in Soho China Town. Really delicious!",

    "text": "Who doesn't love a huge helping of katsu curry (breaded pork) and rice with veg for under \u00a37?! There is no such thing as too much of a good thing.Any foodie who appreciates good value for money and a love for Japanese curry should experience Misato. My advice would be to arrive early, i.e. 12pm for lunch and 6pm for dinner - trust me, there is usually a queue to get into this joint. \u00a0Also they are cash only and we all know how rammed atm machines can get around Chinatown, be prepared and bring your pennies.Misato will not disappoint. If it does, then I would question your taste palette!",

    "text": "Came here for lunch as it seemed to have good reviews. That was a mistake. The portions are huge and the price is cheap. However, that is it. The soba was tasteless and the soup tasted like something out of a packet. The katsu was borderline. The rice was not japanese rice and a bit bland. Come for the prices and portions, not for the quality.",

    "text": "Ah, Misato. What can I say that hasn't already been said? It's a pokey little Japanese place that serves fantastically unpretentious food in gargantuan portions. \u00a0For those times when you just want a decent meal and couldn't care less about the trappings of fine dining, this is your destination. \u00a0It's a shame there's no option for brown rice, but ho hum! I really recommend the Katsudon, a massive slab of pork katsu topped with a frankly terrifying amount of wobbly egg... stuff, sitting on a bed of rice, served (slightly hilariously) with salad. It looks weird, but ZOMG the taste, and you really can't argue with the price. Come hungry! Oh, and come early! The queues really do extend out the door during busy periods.",
