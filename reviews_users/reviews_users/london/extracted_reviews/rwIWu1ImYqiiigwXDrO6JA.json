Give it a try, I am sure you will love it, we need more good value, excellent street food like this in London.Juan Gerdts",

The buns are fresh and fluffy, the perfect complement to the amazing dog. \u00a0There's also a wealth of choices to be had in a spread of toppings sure to satisfy every palette, though I personally prefer to go with just ketchup. \u00a0My only complaint is that it's so far away and I'm not sure when I'll be in London next. \u00a0But when I get back, I know where I'm going for lunch.",

Big Apple Hot Dogs is located at the lower end of Caledonian Road, just near the bridge over Regents Canal, and fairly inconspicuous in amongst the standard greasy spoons and off-licences found in the same stretch. Despite this, it's worth going the extra mile for, as the hot dogs are amazing. Fairly simple, no frills, you get a choice of differing dogs, a bun, onions and mustard or ketchup, all for a fiver or below. The dogs are well made, meaty and delicious, the bun fluffy and fresh, and it all makes quite a good meal with which to pop yourself down by the canal, and watch the world go by, as you make happy eating noises at the deliciousness of their wares. Alternatively, the establishment have a small roped off area out the front in which to eart, if you dare not venture far with your newly acquired hot dog.Seriously, if you're in Kings Cross, and want something decent, with no frills for lunch, make the trip up Cally Road - you won't regret it.",

    "text": "I had the luck of trying these bad boys at Feast this year. Hot dogs always bring me back to summers in New Jersey with my family, so I wanted to get one with the right flavours. The Big Frank was perfect! I love that they offer all toppings for free so you can have as much or as little as you want. Sure they're a bit more expensive than the hot dog stands in NYC would be but oh well, supply and demand. I just had an interview near Old Street so now I'm really hoping I get it so that I can come here for lunch!",

Decent size dog, grilled to perfection. Loving the onions and pickles. Topped off with American french's mustard. Happy days. I'd have to wade in if I am in the area.",

We went all out and got the huge pole, 8 inches of the magnificent pork & beef blend seasoned with sage, mace and cayenne pepper and sitting on top of a nice toasty bun with caramelized onions.The dog was big and juicy. It did not fit in the bun and spilled out on each end. Not a traditional NYC hot dog but still mighty tasty!",

    "text": "It's like this: The Man has a cart and sells hot dogs/sausages. This in itself shows that The Man understands. Hotdogs are street food and should be eaten on the street after having drunk more than you should have been allowed. Sauces and condiments should be added and spilled liberally on expensive trainers. It's the law. AND the hotdogs are very very good. If you're looking for the traditional hotdog- the Big Frank is the epitome. It's exactly what you want. If not, go for the the Big Dog. It's a polish sausage of impressive stature. Not down with pig? Get the 100% beef dogs. You know you want to. I have to stop here because I feel slightly uncomfortable. I keep wanting to describe things, but all I keep coming up with words like Huge and Succulent and in conjunction with various terms for sausage, it's a bit... um.. suggestive. So, in conclusion -Go find Big Apple Hot Dogs and feast on the hottest, juiciest, most meaty pork swords/tube steaks London has to offer.",

    "text": "There is a severe shortage of good hot dog vendors in this town, and luckily Big Apple Hot Dogs has stepped up to fill this niche. Now when I think of hot dogs, I don't imagine those hyper-processed spam-like frankfurters that you get at the supermarket in packs of 12, I mean a hearty full-bodied curvy spiced bit of meat bursting at the seams of its casing. Tuck it in a bun a few sizes too small and cover it in ketchup, mustard, caramelised onions and then you have a 'dog worthy of the name. Big Apple can provide just that.One of the Eat St vendors, the Big Apple stall can be found most Fridays at the London Street Feast and periodically through the week at Kings Cross. Quick tip...if you check in via the Yelp app you can get yourself a free drink!They have a selection of 'dogs but I went for the full beef traditional 'dog. Overall, I'd say it was pretty good. Maybe not up there with some of the offerings I've had in NYC and Chicago, but better than anything you can get here. After building it to spec (as described above) with the addition of some of The Rib Man's hot pepper bbq sauce, I proceeded to demolish it in just over a minute. The meat was juicy and full of flavour, the onions sweet and added a bit of crunch, and the sauces some acidity and spice. Yep, it was good. Be warned, if you add sauces it's going to get messy. Grab plenty of paper towel and be careful of your clothes as mustard stains don't suit anybody's look. One area of improvement - the bun. The first time my bun was decidedly average and I was left wondering if they decided to save some time and dough and just get generic hot dog buns. The second time the bun tasted a bit stale so I'm pretty sure the focus is on the sausage not the bread. Not a dealbreaker, but given the evident love and care that goes into everything else, it's a bit of a letdown when something as simple as bread isn't up to scratch.",

I've been to their Old street spot, as well as when they set up on Kings Boulevard (now called Kerb, formerly Eat St). Being from NY I can back these guys up. They made delicious hot dogs, and provide all the necessary toppings. Yum.Oh yeah and the owner is a real boss.",

I was surprised and at first a little disappointed that they're really not that similar at all - apart from perhaps the bun. But as soon as I took the first bite I realised that this was no bad thing! The sausages are big, juicy and very tasty. I had a the half beef, half pork, which was delish. It reminded me more of (excellent) sausages I've had in German markets rather than on the streets on Manhattan. It's a little more expensive than a New York dog, but given how big it is, at \u00a34 I think it's a steal!I see a few more working from home days coming up over Summer...",
