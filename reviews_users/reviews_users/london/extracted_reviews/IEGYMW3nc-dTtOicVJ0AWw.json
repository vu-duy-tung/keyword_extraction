No garlic. \u00a0We said something to the Italian waitress who, being from Italy, understands what bruschetta bread is supposed to be! \u00a0I gave them two stars (vs one) because I ordered the ravioli which was decent, not great, but ok.  If this restaurant was in the Bay Area (California) where we live, it would quickly go out of business. \u00a0The expectation here is for high quality, \u00a0fresh breads and produce with organic, locally sourced ingredients when possible. \u00a0We ended up eating most lunches at Pret A Manager (fast food) while in London. They had much better food for a fraction of the price.",

But, this is my favorite. \u00a0It's set along a row of other chain restaurants across from Trafalgar Square and became my go to for a break or dinner when I was staying at a nearby hotel. \u00a0The atmosphere inside is very warm french brasserie, and the service is on top of the small roomThe window is filled with sweet patisserie creations - beautiful cakes, macaroon and tarts - which beckon in people for afternoon tea, which they do very well, and the treats are as good as they look. \u00a0The other food is equally good - and offers a good range of options. \u00a0It's the type of place that collects a diverse crowd and serves them all well from tea times, desserts and coffees to a well-cooked meal. I still occassionally find myself in there with a craving for their Salmon Nicoise Salad - always delivered with a perfectly grilled salmon steak on top. And, on top of all that it is very reasonable with reasonable prices on-going and special deals offered daily..TIP: It doesn't have wi-fi (it's major downfall), but if you sit on the right side you can pick up the one from the restaurant next door. .",

Stay away! \u00a0Naively believed that a cafe is supposed to serve food that is ordered..Saw the cafe looking nice, there are 2 or 3 next to each other..3 or ya meant to have breakfast while on stopover in London..had to physically call for menu to be brought..then for waitress.. waitress (Cosmina- sp?) could not speak English to such extend that she would not understand an order, clearly stated on a menu \"tea pot, English breakfast\".. she was under impression that this means \"breakfast\" . This is TEA room in London, tea capital of the world!! Should've left, but we did not. Eventually, tea and 2 out of 3 eggs dishes were brought.. and napkins ..but no silverware! Flagging the waitress did not result in any attention. Some 5-10 min later I had to go inside and inquire about silverware (and this is waitress served place, so no self serve silverware anywhere). I asked about my son's breakfast order.. they looked around.. eventually said \"2 minutes\". Another 5 minutes later 3 red order still did not materialize. Not sure whether they thought that we should eat our meal while my son just sat - or wait and have our meal go cold - or just forgo his order. Talking to a girl making coffee got a comment that they are busy, and if I am unhappy with the waiter (who was talking to other people), I should just talk to her. Eventually, dish appeared, and manager was not apologetic, but was telling me how they are busy (well, say so, we would've gone next door!) , and how the waitress only works for a second day, and \"other people also complain\". I cancelled the pastries order, and went in to pay.. they attempted to charge gratuity!!! And were rude and snide and dismissive when I demanded to take this off! Beware!! (Food was OK, but I now have a heartburn after it, and I did not even finish the meal)",

I requested a new plate for the duck breast salad, and received a better dish afterwards.All in all I finished the meal after an unexpected 2.5 hours, perhaps understaffed kitchen? I cant comment.",

But, I have to admit that the food my family had was pretty good and they were pleased. Overall, nice a place.",

I highly recommend this restaurant and staff. \u00a0The location of this restaurant is perfect for having a delicious breakfast before heading out to see the numerous sites that London has to offer.

Definitely not the place for a formal meeting.Coming to the food - ordered a pizza, which was quite good. Also ordered red wine which seemed a little off, almost like the bottle had been open too long. Overall an average experience. Wouldn't mind going again to try coffee & desserts.

    "text": "As we sat in caffe concerto deciding on what kinds of pasta to pair with which kinds of sauce, outside there was a concerto of protesters marching down the street. People with all sorts of signs and kids and jackets marched through the rain along what seemed like a parade. Drums beat, horns blared. And it was only after some time of studying this strange procession that I came to realize it was meant to be a protest. None like I had ever seen before. Relatively peaceful, nicely cordoned off to a lane dedicated to itself, and ultimately with a relatively happy and upbeat fanfare not relegated to what I would expect to be an mob wielding pitchforks. Then I began to think - have we as a society come so far as to normalize a protest? I had recently participated in the walk to defeat ALS in NYC with my family and this seemed more like that than the Black Lives Matter protests down the streets of NYC. But with neo-liberal yuppies heading to protests as if they were extra-curricular activities - is it starting to normalize into a Saturday afternoon activity as these kind people were doing outside in the streets?The inside of Caffe Concerto beamed with bright lights and fancy chandeliers. My friend who brought me called it: \"the kind of restaurant that makes you SEEM fancy when you sit in it and eat.\" We sat and ate pasta, chocolate cake, prawns, and mushroom soup to the accompaniment of the fanfare / protest / celebration of protest just outside our window.Ultimately, the food was 3/5 so there's that too.",

    "text": "I was actually chasing after an afternoon tea bus tour by B Bakery that happens to pick up customers nearby this tea place that is close to Trafalgar Square. Realizing that you have to book in advance to join in on the fun we didn't end up doing going on the Afternoon tea bus tour. We were still hungry though, and were craving some afternoon tea.As we looked further ahead on Northumberland Ave. we noticed a tea room. The display outside was actually quite appetizing with cakes, tarts, pastries, and anything you can imagine to try as you sip your cuppa. Mesmerized by the huge display of pretty cakes and tarts we decided to give it a tryWe had the afternoon tea set and it was okay. It came with 2 raisin scones + whipped butter, a raspberry macaroon, chocolate mousse cake, strawberry cake, and a cheesecake lemon cup with layer of graham on the bottom. The scones were okay but a bit dry. I felt that they would have tasted better if served warm as well. After trying all the sweets I think the chocolate mousse cake was my favourite as it was dense and rich but good. The strawberry mousse cake was good too but it was a little too sour. You get to choose a tea as well so I ordered a blueberry fruit tea to try that comes in a pyramid shaped tea bag for you to steep.It was great value for the amount of sweets and cakes that you get but it can be really sweet and filling if you try to finish it all in one sitting.We decided to get a side of tapa like appetizers to share as well.The overall experience was okay. The interior is like the lobby of an opera house and has chandeliers everywhere. Decent place but would probably try a different place next time.",

    "text": "Afternoon set was $18.xx with champagne. We order one and eat it as lunch and can't finish it for 2 people. \u00a0Their dessert is good. Scone is ok, served warm. Excellent value and nice decor inside. They make wedding cakes and their dessert are better than average.They ask if we want table outside or not, and check for good table for us. The guys were friendly. One lady we talk to is a bit cold.People will refill our tea without us asking and don't give us a look when we ask share a tea set. I feel they are friendly at their service. We saw other has chicken salad and that looks good with chicken breast and good portion Caesar salad for 12.xx\u20ac.Good value overall outside the National Gallery and St James Park.There is no free toilet in London, not even in train station. People want to borrow bathroom for free does not give fair review.",

It tasted stale. My wife had the lemon cheesecake which was very good. \u00a0Our tea and coffee were good but the poor service and pretty high prices made it a one star. Would not recommend or ever come back.",

    "text": "My husband and I were staying at a hotel just down from here and ended up purchasing dessert from them just about every night while visiting London. Between my husband and me, we ate about 18 Macaroons, a Tiramisu cup, the Strawberry G\u00e2teaux, \u00c9clair Chocolate Cr\u00e8me, Chocolate Mousse, and the Mixed Berries Mousse. Everything was fresh and delicious. We came so frequently that we chatted up the one man who seemed to be working the counter every night. He informed us that they have about eight locations just in central London with one bakery making the desserts fresh every morning for all of them. If you find yourself in the area and have a sweet tooth, I recommend you getting a take-away of one of their lovely desserts.",

We finished ordering and the food came out in a decent amount of time, but they forgot some of the food we ordered...i ordered the strawberries and banana pancakes were a little tough but the blueberry yogurt was delicious! I'd say food is the highlight but the service was awful...we ordered water in the beginning but didn't get it until the end. Very disappointed.",

Guess what happened next, he brought 2 same cakes. I didn't want to argue with him...so we kept both and ate it. When my bill arrived (12.65\u00a3) I'd asked a waiter if a service charge was included. his answered \"yes\", but If i want he could remove it. I'd told him to keep the money... next thing that I saw after payment been processed was 14.65\u00a3. A waiter put extra 2\u00a3 tip for himself, without asking me. And of course I found it right away... The guy was offering me 2\u00a3 \"refund\"... I couldn't believe that.Never go back again!",
