It had just opened and looked really sleek and modern.As others had mentioned, the staff were very helpful and let me know what was vegan (although everything is labelled). I would say 90% of their mains were vegan, but they only had one vegan dessert (carrot cake: tasty, but not incredible). Over 50% of mains were gluten free.I tried everything (except the green salad and bread- who has time for that at a pay-by-weight restaurant?) and was not let down. I had new flavour combinations and was excited about making some of the things at home. I was also delighted my non-veg company were bowled over by the flavours. Good food is good food. I feel bad for the other reviewer who didn't have the best food- everything we had was super fresh!PROTIP: you only need ONE seitan rib. Those suckers will fill you up! (and weigh your plate down).I would absolutely go again for a special night out.Oh yes- and I always mention the toilets! very clean and lush. Not sure why the hand dryer is by the toilet, as all the water from your hands flings onto the toilet seat.",

We didn't really get good service though, \u00a0having to ask for drinks multiple times. I was also disappointed that we were told certain options wouldn't be replaced as it was too late in the day. I also think it is overpriced, with a tiny sesame ball cake costing \u00a0\u00a32.95. As I said above the food is amazing but as an experience I wasn't blown away. \u00a0Could do better Ethos..",

    "text": "I have a lot of veggie mates and always feel sympathy pains when we end up somewhere where their choice is risotto or rabbit leaves (though we do our best to avoid such places!). So we were excited to try this place out, where the food is all veggie, largely vegan and a good amount of gluten-free.Our night was almost over before it began though when they said they'd lost our booking - though my friend had forwarded us all the confo email so it did exist. We got some excuses about teething problems and being newly opened, then were sort of left standing around near the door eyeing up all the food. We decided to wait it out (it being minus two outside) and were seated within about 20mins by the apologetic front of house. So not the best start!We headed straight for the buffet, obvs taking a tactical approach to the pay-by-weight system - skip the bread rolls, load up on the lighter lentils etc! I'm what you'd call 'an eater' but I didn't go overboard on loading up my plate, wary that you have no idea what it's going to add up to. I managed to have the second most pricey plate in our group of 6 at about \u00a313, which was a bit more than I expected. Others ranged from \u00a38-16.The food was tasty, fresh and colourful - which is important given the first bite is with the eye and all that. I'm also a big fan of variety so it was great to be able to try lots of different things (the courgette ribbons with feta were probably my fave). Sadly though a couple of things had run out (after my mate nabbed the last seitan rib!) and weren't speedily refilled. It also falls into the unavoidable buffet trap that the food will never be quite piping hot (esp after you've been lingering for a while in the hope of more ribs!).I really liked the look of the place, as we got a very cool table that was enclosed by 'tree trunks'. I just expected it to be a bit cheaper, given the kitchen must be easier to run with their set-up and they're saving on table service... Hopefully the other teething problems will be smoothed over with experience though so it's worth a try. I'd give them a call to reconfirm your booking on the day though.",

Ethos manages to feel a little lux, which is unusual in the healthy food market imho. \u00a0The decor is top-notch, natural but also expensive looking. The food always looks attractive, though I'd steer clear of the fried foods as they don't hold their crunch after the hit the buffet. If you want 5-star food, opt for the set menu which is noticeably better - esp the macaroni balls in a luscious mushroom sauce!This isn't a cheap option, but it is a classy-looking spot and so I think the prices reflect it. Would deffo come back if I was in the mood to be healthy, but also looked after well :)",

You can pick whatever you like and they would charge you by weight.My full plate was \u00a312 so it is not cheap for a canteen like, self service restaurant but food was all tasty. The setting is also very stylish and quite relaxing.. \u00a0Seats are nicely spaced with nice furniture. The only reason I gave 3 star instead of 4 star are price and lack of filtered but free water. For such healthy and sustainable feel, the place should have a nice jug of filtered water - instead you would have to ask for water at the cashier and it is really pure tap water - not even infused with any cucumber or lemon... \u00a0With the restaurant like pricing in this fast, self serving restaurant, it should have nicer service.i think price is off by 20% or so.. \u00a0Should be cheaper...",

Ethos desserts were actually very pretty and I ended up purchasing a fancy chocolate dessert, but when I brought it back to my hotel, I found that the cake part was very dry and the mousse was pretty bitter. That said, I can't say I was impressed with Ethos, but I'd try this restaurant again and see if it's better.",

The food is by the lb. and each dish has a small card which list all the ingredients so you won't confuse the veggie from vegan items. The food is very clean, ie healthy, and the veggies taste fresh. The dishes were good but nothing memorable, the desserts however were top notch, in terms of quality and uniqueness. The chocolate mousse is simply divine.",

This turned out to be a fabulous experience. Looking at our dissapointment for not able to get High Tea opportunity, the server gave us one free tea, which was a very nice gesture. They had wide spectrum of options for vegan desserts to choose from, and ofcourse variety of teas. It was a pleasant experience dining in and came out stuffed. If you want High Tea, please book in advance as this is one of the few which offers vegan options. LOVED It. Would love to go back some day for High Tea.",

Being a vegan, I am always on the look out for food that has no animal products in it. The food at Ethos is displayed out on a couple of smorgasbord tables (not refrigerated) and who knows how long the bowls of food have been out. The food is all room temperature, tastes bland and not seasoned at all. The desserts were all melting because of the heat. We decided to try a variety of desserts and had to literally throw them out. The donuts tasted old and stale. We couldn't eat them. The chocolate mousse dessert base was also stale and hard. Very disappointing! The cupcake was the same - inedible.I am not a fussy eater. I just expect food to be fresh and tasty. At Ethos, neither was true. The food offered is overpriced and tasteless. Ethos needs to do better. Food for vegans can/and is so much better!",

People will happily spend 15 GBP on a burger, but salads should be downgraded to something you should get for under a fiver. The place itself is beautiful and the salad bar surely is the prettiest I have ever seen. The presentation is amazing, which means that the term 'buffet' doesn't really fit that well into Ethos.The variety isn't large and you will not go from one table to another like at Whole Foods, but the taste is absolutely magnificent. I have eaten A LOT of salad, in many cities and countries around the world, and this surely is the best one I have ever eaten. The textures and the overall consistency was outstanding. Every bite had a new taste, a new texture and a new spice. I had a 'broccoli \"meat\"ball' from the warm table as well, which was so good. Really tasty.Luckily for me, I do not live in London. Therefore I wouldn't be able to get this salad very often - my bank account is happy.",

    "text": "It pains me to give this great concept of a restaurant a poor review. I'm gluten and dairy free - I am not vegan or vegetarian - but I empathised with the owner's reason for creating this place. Because basically, if you have any kind of very strict diet, eating out sucks. After following the opening in the media, I had two big (yet reasonable considering the hype) expectations of Ethos:1. It would be the kind of place you could take people who haven't a food issue care in the world to show them that eating this way can be totally awesome when done right.2. That things I normally have to skip like cakes (because of the flour) scotch eggs (because of the breading), asian noodles (because of the soy sauce) would be available to me since the restaurant takes consideration for healthier alternatives to the \"norm.\"Sadly, neither of the above happened for me. I took fellow Yelper Rachael E and she was great - asked a lot of questions and really tried to get to know the restaurant and its aim. She is neither veggie or GF or DF but had an adventurous attitude and an open mind. Perfect.The food is served buffet style, and you load up your plate then pay by weight. There are cards by each dish that describe the food and also indicate if it's vegan, veggie, GF (no notes for DF but can fall back on vegan I guess). I ended up eating Eritrean Mango Salad, Puy Lentils & Kohlrabi, Courgette Ribbons and Feta, Butternut Squash with Spinach and Feta, along with some roasted potatoes and some marinated olives. Because the food is out, it means the hot food isn't really hot and the cold food isn't really cold. The potatoes tasted like they had been cooked several hours ago and left in a bowl on a counter ... because they had. The olives had a soapy taste to them and the salads were sort of soggy because of the dressings. The Courgette Ribbons ended up being my favourite simply because it tasted the freshest.I paid \u00a314.50 for my plate (and uploaded a photo to get an idea of what that gets you) and \u00a36 for a glass of malbec. You pay by weight as I mentioned, a concept that came under suspicion after placing my moderately filled plate on the scale and thinking \"that plate was actually really heavy ... am I paying for that too?\"After paying you find a seat in the beautifully finished dining hall and feast away. As for my expectations:1. I felt so bad about our tepid, soggy pay-by-weight meal that I tried to buy drinks the rest of the night to make up for it.2.I still had to stare longingly at all the cakes I couldn't eat. What I WAS able to eat were the kinds of things I make at home for myself (salads), which felt like a let down. They were meals that are naturally gluten/dairy free. I guess I wanted to feel like they nailed gluten-free carrot cake or vegan chilli or dairy-free ice cream or whatever.So our experience was sadly unimpressive. Not in concept, I love the concept, but in execution. Keep in mind it was only their second week so there may be some things to iron out yet. And I'm sure the options change weekly if not daily and maybe I missed a glut of GF and DF options in their arsenal. Also, I am not exactly their target diner, but I hope to be someday as they grow into this niche of serving diners who are much more food conscious.",

I had heard a lot about this place, both that it was amazing and that it was expensive. I'm writing to tell you that only one of these is true. It is fancier than a regular canteen and looks very pretty inside, I agree that for vegans and vegetarians, it must have a powerful draw. The buffet-style area is well laid out and colourful. I will add that it touts itself as being healthy and different but I didn't think the food healthy at all. I found it to be stodgy vegetarianism at best. Not vegan. Most of the dishes I saw had some kind of cheese or milk product and the rest were pretty oily. Where's the health?They had a number of salads and hot dishes. I went for a cauliflower salad, some rice, what i thought was tofu (was halloumi), potato gratin, mushrooms covered in cheese and a mac and cheese ball. I feel a bit sick now. I made poor choices. Though there wasn't that much else that looked good and didn't weigh a ton. I ended up pay \u00a311.32 for a half full box of vegetables. Outrageous. That mac and cheese ball probably cost at least \u00a32 on its own. And that's where they make their money. \u00a311 worth of vegetables fills more than a tiny little box in the real world but not at Ethos. Poor vegetarians, they are really getting taken for a ride in this place. I am betting there is no way of getting out of here without spending at least \u00a38. Unless you fill a box with lettuce. It's just grossly overpriced and the food is designed to be so. Big chunks of sweet potato, different kinds of swede, deep-fried balls of this and that. Of course they want you to spend a lot of money. But I guess they don't care if you come back. I'd take a pass, if I were you. You don't need to sacrifice your soul to pay for this place.",

The decor is so beautiful and the fairy lights around the tree, the fire place makes the whole place even more wonderful. I like how they have the option of having starters first before you get your food. I ordered the vegan option, the mushroom tostadas, and it was so yummy despite how I don't even like mushrooms that much.Then, we got to check out the hot and cold \"buffet\" style food. Everything I tried was delicious, from the avocado salad, hummus, cauliflower salad, to the stews, sweet potato wedges etc. There were so many amazing vegan options and I must say everything tasted amazing. It's nice that you don't have to pay for your food every time -- they just add it to the bill for the table. The only complaint is that it is quite expensive but I thought the experience was very worth it. Even my meat eater friends enjoyed their vegetarian dinner thoroughly. Even if you're not vegetarian/vegan, you have to try this place! Ethos is definitely one of my favourite places to go for lunch/dinner in London.",

    "text": "Ate here last night and I'm still so excited about this restaurant! Love the buffet style, especially as I wanted to try just about everything they had. The food had such imaginative variety (unusual things on offer that I've never found in restaurants before, even those that are solely vegetarian/vegan), really tasty, fresh and healthy. They're also very clear about what goes in everything- I went with fellow yelper Frances C who's allergic to nuts and soy; we found the food was well labelled, and the staff were super friendly and helpful when we asked them questions.It's done by weight so it can be quite expensive, but I honestly felt it was worth it. I'd warn to be \u00a0careful with how you load up your plate though- somehow mine ended up as \u00a317 and Frances' ended up as \u00a328!! (Our plates honestly didn't even look that different either, she must have selected really dense foods?!)Overall I was happy and would definitely want to return!",
