A very bland and generic Pub experience. Just like the others no waitstaff (no matter what the review or chit on the table says). So you have to go the bar and order your food and drinks.",

It closes late, it has space for large group, an upstairs room with TV and crystal lights, plenty of beers, take cards.. and well that's it.Like many pub, it is a chain, don't expect magic to happen. It is very standard, and I guess that i why a lot of people likes it. If you are on this street, I would rather recommend the Prince of Teck's down the street. Much more cozy, a touch fancier, wayyy better to grab a drink and catch up with some friends.",

    "text": "It was our first night in London and we were exhausted from our train ride there from Paris so we wanted to find somewhere near our hotel room. The Courtfield was only a two minute walk from our hotel (The Trebovir Hotel). As we walked in, the atmosphere was rustic and appropriately worn out, but in a cozy this-is-clean way. When we found the staircase to the dining room upstairs, we were greeted by the waitress who seated us without hesitation. We ordered and food arrived quickly! I ordered a cocktail shrimp appetizer and my sister ordered their soup of the day, both very tasty! For our main dish, I got the salmon, which while it wasn't the most mindblowing soft, succulent salmon i ever ate, the portion and large sides are more than overcompensating for what the dish may be lacking in taste. My sister had the chicken, which tasted a lot better than the salmon. Their potato sides were INSANELY heavy (and delicious)! We didn't make it to dessert because the dinners were large, heavy and absolutely fulfilling!Our waitress was nice and accommodating and understanding that we are tourists and know absolutely nothing, which was nice, but it could also be because Earl's Court is such a tourist living spot and we were in the midst of the olympics for London.Otherwise, I would definitely recommend it for people in Earl's Court living nearby that wants a good, affordable and novel experience in what seems like a rustic and \"traditional\" london-like dining environment (but take it with a grain of salt, i'm American and is culturally idiotic to what real \"london\" is). But I would definitely stand behind the beautiful, rustic and antiquated atmosphere of the dining room, it played a part in our overall pleasant dining experience! It really set the tone of our first night in London!",

They also sell several real ales, so they seem to really be making an effort to turn te place around. They also have a later licence than the nearby Blackbird. The interior seems to have had something of a makeover, in the traditional style - lots of vermilion ceilings and dramatic draping curtains. The mix of customers is still varied, and it can get packed when Chelsea play at home, but it's moved from a place to be avoided to one where we've happily had a few drinks! ***********************This is the first pub you see emerging from Earl's Court tube station, and from the outside it looks like a nice, large, traditional pub. Don't be fooled: although the interior looks OK, and it serves real ale, the service has in our experience always been pretty unfriendly, and it seems to possess an edgy (unpleasant) atmosphere - perhaps because the SkySports on the huge TV screen, combined with the jukebox music, militates against sociability. I'd suggest walking the short distance to the Blackbird, nearby. Much nicer.",

I don't know, if you decide differently to me, leave a review, but here's what I think...Being charged \u00a35.30 for a shandy (I've lived in London too long) and a blackcurrant squash is painful enough, but no Yelper would let that cloud judgement. The tables are all square, and too close together. The food, nice as some as it is (I didn't try the sticky toffee pudding to be fair) you just know it is cash and carry microwaved stuff, even the beer tastes like a faceless chain pub beer, and I know you know what I mean. That said, this isn't an awful pub. On a sunny day, the light through the window is lovely, there are seats outside, and the staff were friendly. The price wasn't ridiculous for that area of London I guess. So it gets a star or two. Basically, when I go anywhere, pub, restaurant, cafe, shop, I want to go there, becuase I want to go THERE. The courtfields is a pub you go to cuz its convenient for the station (or for the sticky toffee pudding, but my mum makes the best sticky toffee pudding, sorry Amanda, it's a fact!)Meh, I've experienced better! 2 stars!",

About a block out, we find the Courtfield and see their sign for \"traditional English breakfast\" for something like 4.99 pounds. Even converted into dollars, that's more than decent, so we give it a shot.My parents ordered the traditional, while I opted for their salmon and eggs. Delicious! The smoked salmon was very fresh and the eggs and toast were great too. Nothing fancy, but good taste. And my coffee...oh man. Once I figured out that \"white coffee\" means \"with milk,\" I ordered the best coffee with milk I think I've ever had. I also really liked that the patrons weren't just tourists from the surrounding hotels.

I guess I'll just play waiter then!\" her majesty snorted, cutting her off and storming away.Needless to say, we haven't been back since.",

My mouth is watering right now as I type these words. Besides the magnificent toffee pudding, this place is alright. Beer offerings are a little weak but I'm not sure if the options downstairs in the pub section are different than the dining room. My chicken stuffed with asparagus was very good, and I snuck a bite (or 10) of Joe's pie and it was quite tasty. Heavy food, you will definitely be dragging yourself out but the end of the meal.

Well, it was okay, though considering the time I'm not all that surpised that it was quite crowded. I didn't mind it but it wasn't one of the best. Still, having a Tardis across the road is still pretty cool.",

    "text": "Such a conveniently located pub across the street from the Earl's Court Station and within a 1.5 block walk from a series of hotels nearby.We dropped by on a Sunday morning at about 9:30am and the pub was almost completely empty, less another couple. The pub space was huge with plenty of tables and seats on the 1st floor. Yes, there's even a 2nd floor to this spacious pub. There was 2 TVs on the 1st floor meaning this probably isn't a spot people congregate to watch games, but to really chill and relax.We came here to exclusively try an English Breakfast in London and that is EXACTLY what we both ordered. The English Breakfast comprised of 2 sunny side up eggs, beans, 2 small sausages, a slice of ham, half of a tomato, a mushroom and toast. To summarize, the breakfast was really tasty and just what we expected. It was a perfect combination of breakfast foods on 1 plate.Nothing in the breakfast was bad, but at the same time nothing surprised us. It's not like it was something we couldn't make at home, but it was sort of a bucket thing to do in London and something everyone should try in London!",

I ordered the chicken and mushroom pie and I swear they gave me boxed mashed potatoes. It was tasteless and bland but smooth and I felt with the lack of lumps it was boxed. Plus, the carrots weren't peeled, which put me off. The pie came with a puffed pastry top that had a lot of depth. However, the pastry case for the pie was hard and inedible. Again, kudos to the staff, it was a busy Saturday afternoon during the showing of the Grand National and they really held the place together. What came out of that kitchen was a disappointment. I doubt I'll go back.",

New choice for us, so we discuss it. When I say peas or mushy peas, half the pub yells \"MUSHY.\" So we did. We enjoyed them so much that when we got home, we got on Amazon and ordered the dry peas to cook at home, quite successfully I might add.The fish and chips were great too. We highly recommend the Courtfield.",
