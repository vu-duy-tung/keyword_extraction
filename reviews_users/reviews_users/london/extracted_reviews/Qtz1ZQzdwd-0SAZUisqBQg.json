The d\u00e9cor is a little dated but the food is very very good. All at a reasonable price too. The food is traditional Pakistani/Indian thus you will find all your fav curries there. The tandoori dishes are exceptional and the mango lassi is immense.",

However, this is the only entertaining thing about the place. If you think thats entertaining.The food was dire. I'm not sure how they managed to mess up the chutneys and lime sauce (it was salty) but they did. The curries were beyond dire - i've experienced better sauce from the cheapest jar of sauce in a supermarket. I think you even get better curries in most of the states (not known for their curries). They no longer serve Alcohol of any kind - you can't even bring your own to the place, a feature often common with the Indians on Brick Lane.",

It was a Sunday night and although busy, our order was taken promptly. The vegetable samosas were fresh, crispy and very tasty. A good start. Then we waited and waited and waited some more. Loads of people who had arrived after us were served their main courses before us. It gave us time to appraise the decor, which is ok, but overall the harsh lighting spoils the atmosphere, making it seem more like a canteen. I had chosen a vegetable biryani which, when it eventually arrived, consisted of unappetisingly tasteless rice with what looked like frozen vegetables through it. These were overcooked too! There was no accompanying tasty sauce, just a dish of raita. I have eaten Indian food all over the country and this was probably the worst dish I have ever been given. The rest of the dishes were not as bad as this and I am left to wonder if this was just a blip.",

On reading the reviews here, i can better appreciate this place as the expectations aren't mismatched any more.Now Westbourne grove is my favourite street in London in terms of food. You have so many good restaurants serving a variety of cuisines. I have had very good experiences in most of them ... not so here.Don't get me wrong ... the food is good. The thali here is probably one of the best value you can get for Indian meals in Zone 1. For less than \u00a311 you can get rice, 2 curries, papad, a starter and a huge naan. They taste pretty good too. But the service is shabby to say the least. So much so that after i had finally paid by credit card, the server came and left the card on top of some gravy that had fallen on the table cloth. In spite of the good food, i left with a bitter after-taste.Yes, the food is good and cheap ... and would have surely been a regular destination for me in my student days ... but not any more.",

The main meals at Khan's Restaurant start at \u00a35.15 per dish with the usual naan and rice options to order separately. I ordered a staple chicken korma, pilau rice and bottled water. While a korma may be a not-so-adventurous choice it is generally a good gauge to the quality of an Indian restaurant. The patient service soon began to lack, our orders were scattered around the table without being announced and left me serving dollops of paneer onto my bed of rice before realize it all smelled wrong. The food itself was satisfactory and served the purpose of filling my stomach void but there is nothing fabulous to report. The flavour lacked lustre and was without that special touch.The single bill kept mobile calculators at hand and they were slow to deal with debit card payment. \u00a0While Khan's won't be making the cut for my repeat visit list, the good company made the experience not all-in-all bad.",

The walls are painted with desert and palm tree murals which adds to the outdated yet wonderful tackyness of the place. The food here is absolutely what makes a trip here worthwhile though. They've got an extensive menu of traditional Indian options. The portions are small enough that you can get a few dishes and share them if you're with a group.

In London there is also a bar on every street corner -- and a Tandoori Restaurant. I stumbled across Kahn's because I was feeling nostalgic for a little apartment I stayed at when I was a kid about 16 years prior. Nearby Queenways Station was/is a cornucopia of ethic diversity - a Catholic Church was sandwiched between a donar kebab stand and curry house. A little further up street was a pedestrian mall and....Khans. The nice thing about Khan's from what I recall was the affordability. \u00a0You could easily spend 50 quid for a dinner out in London, but Khan's was perhaps half that price. Of course, I had the Chicken Tikka Masala which was a mouth watering feast of spicy succulence. Wash that down with a King Fisher and little nan bread, you have just had a quintessential London \"ruby.\"I highly recommend it. Just wish I could snap my fingers and be in the dining room.",

I think my palate may have matured since 'student with no money' days but the flavours were only average.So overall, 3 stars for feeding me cheaply over the years!",

    "text": "I think it's important to review a place within a context. So those comparing this place to other Indian/Pakistani establishments which serve main courses at 10-12quid per, are being unfair to both sorts of establishments. I compare this inexpensive foodjoint to other similarly cheap and cheerful spots and find it satisfies quite well for those days when you're feeling broke and feel like some greasy but delish curry. Their maincourses are priced at levels which can only be matched by take-away food, if at all. The decor and the size of the place screams of the stereotypical curry houses with cut-out ethnic decor and faux exotic images. I have to admit that this is not the sort of place I would pick to go to on a night out - I've become somewhat averse to greasy curry unless I'm drunk. But a Siberian friend was in town and wanted some Indian curry, London style, and thus we ended up here. Service was passable, didn't annoy but didn't delight either. The menu had a wide range of offerings and looking at how inexpensive the dishes were, I assumed the portion sizes would be small, and we ended up over-ordering some. Nothing terribly distinctive about the food - it was spicy, a bit greasy and served in ample proportions, regular Indian fare. It was tasty and made in conventional ways - don't expect cool fusion dishes or anything overly experimental here. \u00a0Nothing was unbearably hot for my Siberian friend, who has low-ish spice tolerance; he was well pleased about partaking in a quintessentially Londonesque meal. I would recommend this place as an OK place to stop by if you're in the area and looking for a cheap option... I don't imagine going out of the way to eat here, but nothing about it makes me want to avoid it either.",

    "text": "Khan's of Bayswater a bit like that Star Trek film it's named after - The Wrath Of Khan. It started out with good intentions, hoping to save the world with tasty food. Unfortunately somewhere along the way it became a genetically modified super evil villain that wanted nothing more than to destroy captain Kirk. The last few times I've been there it's been getting worse and worse, and last time was the last straw. I don't want to go there again. The food was rubbish and the bill was expensive. The service sucked and the cutlery was dirty. Once the producer of the best butter chicken in the universe, Khan's is now running on impulse power compared to the warp speed of Tayyab's, Mirch Masala and Raavi's.",

I can see how the reasonable prices (for the location), decent portions (though smaller than my local takeaway), and informal atmosphere would appeal to students as well as anyone else wanting a low key meal out.The service was acceptable (though they forgot our tapwater). We greatly appreciated the fact they validated our parking.However, while we wanted \u00a0to enjoy this, bottom line is, the food was frankly poor. Both our currys were so spicy they we couldn't really taste the food properly. Even my korma was hot, I couldn't taste the coconut at all. I must admit I don't like very spicy food so this immediately killed it for me but my girlfriend was raised on it and felt the same about hers. The rice was ok but the naan was very oily and not very soft - overall below the standard of my local takeaways. I will leave this place for the students and tourists in future.",

    "text": "Ok, so I must confess I have been coming to Khans since before some Yelpers were born! I used to live across the road from the damn place which made avoiding it almost impossible (I didn't try). For those new to this place it is an institution. Just around the corner from Queensway it is packed almost all the time. It has a front section which is the nice end of the restaurant with restful palm trees and a nice faux sky painted on the ceiling (try and sit in here if you can). The interior section is darker. It tends to be where large groups (of which there are tons) tend to go. Try not to get sat near the serving hatch at the back where the dirty plates are shoved as the clattering of plates is a bit jarring.The other thing to note about Khans is that it isn't at all about relaxed dining. Given the numbers it is get in get food and get out (think Wong Kei in the 1980s but nowhere near as bad). No lingering over polite conversation and a mango Kulfi. Sure, they have desert and the staff don't rush you but it's important to note if you want lots of time best to go elsewhere. But don't (go elsewhere). Go to Khans. The food-oh the food. I have been eating Indian food for 30+ years and can find no restaurant that can cook food of this quality in such numbers and consistently year in year out. We don't tend to have starters given that we aren't interested in elongating the dining. If we do, then we'll have a chicken tikka which is moist and not overly reddened by food colouring. It looks natural and tastes it. We always have the same mains-chicken tikka masala (really creamy and tender pieces of chicken-mildy spiced and perfectly balanced); chicken jalfrazi (this is not for amateurs-it's basically a sauce which consists of minced green chillis-tart, acidic, deep, hot, spicy and hot (again). It's not for the faint-hearted but I have had no dish anywhere like it. Try it-you won't regret it (actually you might but only because of the heat).Final point -Khans is booze free. I'm not sure if this is because it is a Pakistani owned restaurant or because they had too many problems with drunks. I do recall almost getting into a fight with a drunk in there one night who insisted on talking very loudly about his recent dysentery-like symptoms, so maybe it was the latter. Anyway, they do Cobra alcohol free and the Redan Tavern on the corner of Westbourne Grove and Queensway is a fine first stop. Enjoy.",

I loved visiting London and I was very excited to try the exotic cuisines they have there and this one hit the mark. I was staying near Hyde Park so this was a nice walk for me. If you need to try a great South Asian Halal restaurant this one is the one. Since I have previously worked at restaurants and managed them one problem I always encounter is the portion. \u00a0They have such small portions and it's so damn pricey. I wish this wasn't the case.

I had an absolutely wonderful time staying in the Hyde Park area and exploring one of the most historic and popular cities of the world. Having a Pakistani background, my family and I had to try this restaurant. We ordered the usual for a desi person: biryani, chicken tikka, saag, butter chicken, and naan. Everything was delicious. We were amazed at the quality, taste, and presentation the food had. In the west coast of the U.S., we do have a few popular Pakistani restaurants such as Shalimar, Shahnawaz, Al-watan, Noorani, Tandoori Fresh and many others. Each of these have their own tastes and masalas that lead to their deliciousness, but when I came to Khan's I noticed something else that was in our favor. The portions. Perfectly sized portions for families were what got us to love this place. I really appreciate when business owners keep the customers in mind and have reasonable portions. If you go to Bombay Masala in New York City, you get the smallest portions, for the largest price tag. That place wasn't even tasty, and the whole tip process was a mess. So if you are ever in London and knowing about the large Pakistani population there, I'm sure you would like to give the cuisine a try. Khan's is the place to go. Thanks for the wonderful ambiance and food.",
