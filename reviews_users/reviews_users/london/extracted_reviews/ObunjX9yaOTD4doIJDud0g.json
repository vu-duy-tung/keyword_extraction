    "text": "I want to hate this place. The fake oldness of it. The too good looking staff.The achingly trendy location.It brings out the inverted snob.But the fact is it's very good eating in pleasant surroundings with genuinely friendly staff.So I really like it.I ordered a couple of the antipasti, the boy had mac and cheese and the missus had a mushroom pizza. They all came at once as we asked and they were all excellent. The lamb meatballs were three generous sized balls swimming in a bold tomato sauce. The other antipasti was a sausage thing with cockles. It came in a lovely dry white wine sauce with plenty of cream and butter to offset it and some huge croutons drizzled with salsa verde to mop up the sauce. The mac and cheese was made with a smoked cheese which was great. The cheese was stringy, the pasta pieces big (a little overdone for me, could have had more bite but that's a small quibble). the pizza was amongst some of the best I've had out. It's all about the crust with a good pizza and this one was firm and chewy and generous and tasty. In fact all the bread was good. We had some garlic bread which was delicious, again, chewy with a nice outside crunch and plenty of butter and herb. And the croutons which came with the sausage and mussel stew served their purpose brilliantly.A winning lunch. The place was incredibly busy and buzzing and this added to the experience and I loved parma hams and salamis hanging from the ceiling and the huge lumps of cheese scattered around. The weathered look of the whole place also works although clearly it's been bought in cos the place hasn't been around long. But it's been carried off with aplomb anyway.Personally I prefer the industrial feel of the Pizza East in Shoreditch. The restaurant there just feels a lot bigger and therefore maybe more comfortable. This one feels a little cramped. But with the space they've got they've done wellA bill of about \u00a350 with a couple of pints of Peroni and I thought that was very reasonable. Straight down to Lisboa cafe for some custard tarts, a nice sunday lunch beautifully rounded off.",

    "text": "When I went to Pizza East Portobello, I expected a somewhat overpriced and uber-hyped venue that opened an outpost in West London with a wrong name. Surprisingly, I was completely wrong. Pizza East Portobello is a lovely place, despite the fake vintage interior. As everybody knows, the crust is the most important part of any pizza. And the crust is where Pizza East Portobello excels. I really liked this pizza, it tasted simply good. There is not much more to say. The wine list also read fine, and my dessert - yet another salted caramel tart - was heavenly. Strong in flavour with a great texture and as good as it could get.All in all, I can only recommend Pizza East. If you like pizza, or good food in general, you should definitely go there.",

    "text": "Oh, the excitement. Rumours have been ripe for ages, and the whole neighbourhood has been vibrating in anticipation of Pizza East coming to this end of Portobello - and with confusion as to why it isn't called Pizza West. I suppose, expectations are just a little bit high when the build-up has been such. Unfortunately, my first impression was rather disappointing when I gave it a try at lunchtime yesterday. I felt compelled to order a pizza expecting to be blown away, or at least be satisfied. Burrata turned out to be an extra special type of mozzarella, but essentially I ended up with a margharita pizza with thyme rather than basil. Not that I noticed the herbs in particular. What I received looked (and tasted) like a big piece of dough with a tin of tomatoes emptied onto it and olives sprinkled all over. It didn't do it for me, there just wasn't enough flavour.But I am sure to be back and give it at least one more try. My friend's collection of antipasi all looked great, and my side salad of lettuce and avocado was nice and crunchy, too.It was lovely sitting out in the sun and watching the world go by. Unfortunately, we were also a bit unlucky with our waiter. He warmed to us in the course of our visit and almost smiled when we left. However, his rudeness was only diverted to his colleagues who left feeling rather sorry for. I'll be back soon and hope to be back with a more positive review then.",

This place reminds me of a place in San Francisco: Great food with a menu that has both classics as well as inventive, seasonal selections, cute and trendy ambiance without being too sceney, delicious drinks, and excellent service. I'm not even a Pizza fan and I love this place. Apart from pizzas , their menu also features a number of other main courses (my personal favorite is the Salmon), great side dishes that emphasize what is in season (I always get the salad that is the special and have never been disappointed), and excellent desserts. I have been here a number of times, with just one friend and also in large groups. I typically share plates with my group so I have gotten to try a lot and have not been disappointed with one thing here - I feel like you can't really go wrong. Along with great service and being nicely situated on Portobello Road in Notting Hill, this is a great choice for a date or a excellent meal shared among friends.",

They make great cocktails; they make great coffee; they make superb pizza. If it's possible, the mac and cheese is just a little too cheesy for my liking. It really could use something to cut through heaviness of seven types of cheese in one dish. That's being a bit nit-picky, of course. A must-try for this part of town!",

I had their white pizza with veal meatballs and pancetta. My friend had the margarita but substituted the mozzarella with burrata.

My husband got the spicy sausage, mozzarella, broccoli pizza, which had a white sauce and was good too, but I prefer their red sauce and the simple, fresh flavors of the Margherita. For a starter, the garlic bread was great too: Little bread ball of garlic butter goodness with a soft middle and a light crisp crust. Okay I know, you're thinking pizza and garlic bread...Yea, it's a bit much on the carbs, but it was worth it \u00a0They have other starters and menu items besides pizza which looked pretty good as I eyed some of the nearby tables - but when my pizza arrived, I lost interest in anything else.Okay, now for some bits on the scene: Located right in the Portabello market area, it was quite busy. Stopped in during lunchtime and the place was buzzing - packed with a mixed bag of couples sitting at the counter (has a good view of the pizza making action) and families with kids. Seating is casual with weathered blue metal chairs and wood tables with two floors indoors and outside seating as well. Our service was quite friendly and prompt contrary to some of the earlier posts on this point but I can see how service could slow down quite a bit if a bunch of orders come into the little kitchen area and pizza ovens all at once.I'd happily be back again! FYI, they also have another (original) location in Shoreditch if you're on the other side of the city.",

Went at 8pm on a Saturday with 5 girls and the place was packed but was really pleased with only a 20 minute wait.Ordered the mac & cheese and lamb meatballs to share to start and both were pretty fantastic. \u00a0These were just as good as the pizzas, so if you aren't craving/don't eat pizza but happen to come here, you're in luck. Shared buffolo mozzarella and pesto pizza, and a couple others. \u00a0The main part of the pizza was thin, but then the crusts were puffy and soft which was really nice. Generally like thin pizza but don't like crispy burnt crusts. \u00a0Ordered a bottle of house white and red, and both were totally fine. No need to splurge on booze here.Would come back on a sunny day for lunch as it looks like all the doors could be opened.Had good service overall, and the hostess called us a taxi when we were leaving as there were none on the street, so that was a plus too. \u00a0Will definitely be going back.",

The veal meatballs with prosciutto and cheese was a tasty treat and a large serve for one or two to share.I enjoyed the side dishes of the sweet potato with wild rice and creme fresh. It had a hidden spice and went down smooth. The pesto garlic bread was also a nice addition.They have a full bar along with cold pressed juices that hit the spot. Many patrons also enjoyed coffee in the casual and fun atmosphere.Service was definitely lacking as our table and another party took several minutes to get our orders taken. The bar seemed to get many drink orders wrong and then another couple had to wait for cutlery to eat. They could use a bit of cleaning up to make this worthy of a return visit.",

The decor is very cute and the area is wonderful. But the breakfast is SAD. Service was non existent. Made a reservation and the hostess seemed bothered, had to ask twice to get water, and then had the worst avocado toast of my life. You may think you can't mess up avocado toast. And I would normally agree with you. But apparently you can, and Pizza East has mastered messing it up. It was bland, unseasoned, the toast was so hard, thin, and cold, the eggs were barely cooked, and the avocado wasn't smashed at all. Overall it was the saddest breakfast. Don't spend \u00a322 on a coffee and two bland avocado toasts. You're better than that.",

I went for the Pork Belly Pizza. It was incredible! The pizza is rustic and crispy with a good amount of soft pork belly meat and crispy crackling. It's a really good pizza. The atmosphere was good in this branch, the restaurant had all its doors open so it was mostly open to the street which was buzzing with the portobello market outside. I'll definitely be back to Pizza East.",

    "text": "The time my mac n cheese was cold, burnt, and dropped on the floor... All that and still 3 stars? It's a nice place, with a good energetic vibe which is also relaxing as well. Some minor celebs were enjoying themselves on a busy Saturday night and we were led to the upstairs dining room which was equally as nice.Starters of Wild Boar and cime di rapa, and asparagus croquettes were great. Then we waited for around 45 minutes until our mains came. \u00a0The burrata pizza although not piping hot tasted fantastic. \u00a0Is burrata just great for anything??? My mac n cheese was unfortunately cold in the middle. The waitress was very apologetic and offered to have it heated up for us. 10 minutes later I hear a crash on the stairs, a runner had unfortunately fallen over carrying a pizza and another plate of food. \u00a0I felt bad for the runner, but wondered whether they would still serve the food the had been dropped. \u00a0Oooh the suspense...The manager rushed to help the waiter up, collected the food, put it on the bar and tried to make the two plates presentable. \u00a0I gasped and laughed. \u00a0But then one of the plates came towards our table. It was a burnt looking mac n cheese. A burnt mac n cheese that had an accident on the stairs. It wasn't so funny when it was my food! \u00a0I wonder who got the pizza? Anyway, after being a bit cold, then burnt, then taking a trip on the stairs, a mac n cheese was finally placed in front of me. We told our waitress who did not see the event what happened and she offered to get us another one. \u00a0By this time we had been there a while and I didn't fancy waiting for another fresh one. \u00a0The manager who tried to pass off the floored food offered us free desserts but we declined as we had to go, but she did give us a free round of drinks and a free mac n cheese to takeaway. The mac n cheese as it turned out was ok, not the best in London but nothing to complain about if it isn't cold, burnt, or hasn't been dropped on the floor. All this and Pizza East still gets 3 stars, service was slow, albeit during a busy night, but the starters and pizza were really good. \u00a0Maybe I was in a good mood despite \"mac n cheese-gate\", but what happened wasn't a reflection on Pizza East I don't think. \u00a0The kitchen was busy so they tried to rush the food out and it wasn't hot. The runner didn't trip up on the stairs on purpose. But the manager made a very poor decision in trying to serve food that had been on the floor, she deserves 1 star, Pizza East 4 stars for the food and vibe, and our waitress 5 stars for trying to rectify things. Still... quite an entertaining and memorable meal on my girlfriend's birthday weekend, but some people's decision making under pressure is highly questionable. \u00a0I wonder how someone who thinks it's acceptable to serve food that has been dropped on the floor can become a restaurant manager for someone like Soho House. \u00a0Is this a reflection on the employment market of the restaurant industry? I know front of house staff work long hours, have to put up with fussy customers and poor wages but serving food dropped on the floor?! You're better than that, or maybe this just isn't the job for you.",

Who could have foreseen my leaving in disgust! I was greeted, and offered a beverage within minutes of my arrival by a friendly hostess and all seemed to be going well. One waiter came to take my order... I ordered a starter and a main, a pizza. The starter arrived in a timely fashion, I finished, and waited. And waited. And waited. -A person came in to order take away pizza and got their pizza faster than I got mine!- Finally my pizza arrived brought by yet another, different waiter. Its delicious, I finish and wait. And wait... etc... etc... Finally the plate is taken away and I am ready to order coffee. Yet no one comes back to ask me or take my order. for coffee, dessert... anything. The 3 different waiters who have served me have gone off in different directions to far corners of the restaurant. I wait, and wait, etc., etc. After 20 minutes of more waiting, and a few minutes trying to catch somebody's eye, I manage to ask for the bill. Twice. To two different waiters as the first one didn't get the bill so I had to ask again. When the bill was brought to me I actually complained -and believe me when I tell you I NEVER complain! But that is how bad the service was, I actually complained! Making me even more upset. It doesn't matter how good the food is, if you have terrible, inattentive service that doesn't care about the customer, you are not going to rush to go back. So, I won't be going back anytime soon or recomending it.",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed by my visit here for dinner with friends. \u00a0 Seated upstairs, we were put on a table at the top of the stairs right in the cold draft of the door downstairs even though we were the only customers up there, which was an uncomfortable squeeze just to get into my seat. \u00a0 The service was okay, but it felt more like a staff hang out spot than a restaurant. We ordered starters of garlic bread, which took forever to get to the table and were less garlic and more over powering herbs and soaked in oil making the bottom of the bread wet. Our pizzas then arrived about 5 minutes later before we'd even really had a chance to eat our starters. This meant that by the time I had eaten about half of my pizza, the other half was stone cold. \u00a0 We also didn't get told that swapping toppings on the pizzas for a different one (I'm vegetarian and don't really like a lot of cheese, which seemed to be on every pizza - no just mozzarella) was at an additional cost. I ended up having to pay \u00a35 extra for a few slices of courgette and a small sprinkling of mushrooms on what was initially a plain pizza. It would have been nice to have been informed of the extra cost at the time of ordering. \u00a0 We ordered the chocolate salted caramel tart for dessert, which was so bitter it was a chore to eat the tiny slice we were served. \u00a0 I normally love the Soho House group restaurants but this was an awful experience, leaving all three of us up most of the evening ill from the food, needless to say I won't be going back to any of the other Pizza Easts any time soon.",

It was chewy and delicious. However, the real surprise(s) were the starters, I ordered the bone marrow bruschetta, egged on by my love of bone marrow; the mushroom and cheese (not sure what cheese) croquettes; and the lamb meatballs. The bone marrow bruschetta was a beautiful marriage of tasty, rich bone marrow, perfectly toasted bread, onion and... I want to say parsley. The croquettes were stuffed with piping hot creamy cheese and mushrooms, you couldn't go wrong with that combo, but the outside was light and crunchy to contrast the richness. My favourite were the lamb meatballs, when it arrived on my table covered with slices of cheese, you knew you were onto a winner. Sauce was great, save it for the pizza crust. Will be visiting again!",

Add to the fact that you're generally paying \u00a35 more than anywhere else for pizza I think that there are much better options to choose from, especially as the selection of pizza is so narrow. However, the mac&cheese and lamb meatballs are actually really good and I would recommend getting these over the pizza if possible. \u00a0They do have a special key ring you can ask for which gets you 50% off so if you know anyone with one, it's worth taking it along. The staff there are really nice and friendly but generally service is very slow, it is not the place to come if you are in a rush or want to be in and out within an hour. \u00a0 All in all, I'd go somewhere else if you can but if you have to go, it's not bad!",

The Decor was cute, although it did feel a bit ingenuine, but I like how the pizza was made in an open kind of setting and the large windows. I went on a sunny day so the large windows were particularly nice.We had the garlic bread, which was good but VERY oily; the Buffalo mozzarella, tomato, basil pizza; the Portobello mushrooms, tomato, fontina, oregano pizza; and the mac and cheese. I had initially ordered the Artichoke, sundried tomato, mozzarella, pesto pizza, but after a miscommunication I ended up being served a pizza with a lot of tomato sauce, mozzarella and some olives. I was disappointed because I was quite excited for my artichoke pizza, but the one i was served was excellent. I would recommend Pizza East and go back in the future.",
