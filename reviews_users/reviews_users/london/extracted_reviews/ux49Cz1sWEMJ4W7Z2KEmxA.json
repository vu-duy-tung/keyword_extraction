    "text": "The address on this is correct, but it's in Canary Wharf, not Chelsea and you should get here by the Jubilee Line or the DLR.But anyway, 5 stars! It has a wonderful golden glow to the decor, so it's very elegant and cool, but still feels welcoming. Servers were extremely nice and attentive. Everything we ordered was delicious with incredibly complex flavors -- eggplant, pork and scallop dumplings, beef skewers, and very filling rice hotpot. Shochu and sake menus looked very intriguing, but I wasn't drinking that night. Best of all, I thought it was going to be extremely expensive but it came out to a bit more than \u00a315 per person for dinner and I can't remember the last time I was so stuffed!",

Flavour of the \u00a0fire as well as the subtle sauces gives them a special taste. The Wagyu beef melts in your mouth. The Negiri sushi is also superlative. Two slight drawbacks for me . . . . the tables are bit oversized and the noise level is quite loud. But the food and the service trumps it all.",

There is also a bar by the entrance, which we didn't use but which looked inviting.Service was good, although our waitress seemed gutted that we went for the tasting menu, cutting her off before she could even start the menu explanation routine. If you want to collect brownie points, listen, nod intently, and then - well, you might as well order the tasting menu. At \u00a350 not a steal, but you get a great selection of sashimi and tempura rolls, grilled vegetables, an intriguing risotto-like rice dish with crab meet, dumplings, skewers ... you're well fed in the end, and content, too. Also, one of my favourite-ever dishes: the butterfish tataki. The timeout review loved this, too, and I now know why.Finally, desserts are a worthy finish to the feast. A great coconut icecream scoop with a passion fruit filling; something resembling a creme brulee, deliciously sweet; and a biscotti-amarone type of pastry. They make some mean Shochu cocktails, too. I had the Nightingale Martini (if I recall correctly), and it's highly recommended. By me, that is.",

    "text": "I visited roka on the bank holiday Sunday this may for the bottomless brunch with my partner and another couple. We were seated near the bar next to the window which I actually much preferred as it felt more casual then in the main part of the restaurant. There are three different set menus you can pick from for the lunch at different price points. We picked the first one which cost \u00a345 per person, you started off with a Bellini or Bloody Mary (I went with the Bellini which was pleasant). Afterwards you pick what you would like to order as your main and choose whether you would like red or white wine (you can swap half way through if you decide you want the other, something many brunches I've been to before won't let you do). Once you have ordered you can go to the buffet table for starters, they have a selection or sushi, sashimi, tempura, and some other dishes. If you're hungry then you could quite easily fill up here as you can keep going back! All in all the food and service was good, however we did have one problem, they bought the wrong main for my partner and when we notified them and asked for his correct dish it took nearly 20 minutes to come - which meant the rest of ours were cold. They weren't very apologetic for the mix up either, which is why I can only give 4 stars, otherwise though it was a great brunch, it wouldn't put me off going back!",

Roka is a lovely and spacious restaurant that is full of light. It was a little busy and loud for a business meeting but we made do. I didn't look at the menu, but trusted my companion's choice in the tasting menu. This place is pricey so I don't even know how much this entire menu cost. A lot, I reckon. Service was swift and very courteous. Quickly an assortment of dishes arrived. Highlights for me were the melt in your mouth salmon and tuna sashimi, the amazing prawn and avocado maki, definitely one of the best rolls I've tasted in London, satay and chilli chicken, and the mushroom in koshu mayonnaise. We also had tempura, gyozas, and a strange chilli thing which i did not like. Everything was beautifully presented and seasoned and a step above every other sushi place I've been to in town. The baked sweet potato was a buttery revelation. Dessert: what a beauty! A selection of fruits, lychee icies, creamy raspberry cheesecake and a slice of incredible mango and chocolate pudding cake. The little taster of mango sorbet was a dream!If I could only eat in one restaurant for the rest of my life, it would be this.",

    "text": "This review is only for the AYCE/AYCD brunch. Amazing!Since moving to London, we've pretty much given up on finding good, moderately priced sushi. We had become spoiled in New York with a wide range of quality sushi options at different price points. However, we heard some great things about Roka's all-you-can-eat and drink weekend brunch. Even though there are a number of Roka's throughout London, only the Canary Wharf location offers this brunch deal, probably due to the desire to lure people to the finance-heavy neighborhood on the weekends...which totally worked on us!We made a reservation for a 12:30pm Sunday brunch seating and ended up arriving a bit early after taking the DLR from Bank. Roka is located on the second floor of the Canada Square building and features floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Canada Square Park. The hostess was quite happy to seat us early, as there was plenty of seating available. The majority of the seating is located across from the buffet in a dimly lit dining room with wooden tables and plush chairs. The front area consisted of the bar, hightop tables and a few more lounge-type seats. We asked if we could sit in the front, as we preferred the natural light as well as the view into the park.As we sat down, we were presented with the brunch menu. Brunch has three different menu options (\u00a342, \u00a354, \u00a366). All of the brunch options come with the buffet, the only difference was the choice of entrees and the wines being served; the most expensive brunch also came with a sashimi platter and a glass of champagne instead of a Bellini. We didn't really care too much about the entrees, as we were focused on the, sushi so we decided to order the cheapest brunch, the koten brunch, at \u00a342.For the welcome drink, there was an option for a Bellini or a Bloody Mary. Adam opted for the Bloody Mary, which was quite good and I had the Bellini. The Bellini was light and clean, albeit a bit more sour than what I am used to, but still a really nice way to start off the meal.After the welcome drinks, we requested the white wine and I asked for a green tea and passionfruit iced tea. The servers were really good about topping off our glasses when they were getting low throughout the two hours we were there. The iced tea was surprisingly great! Not too sweet and it was apparent that they used quality matcha that gave the iced tea a lovely deep green color. The passionfruit added some fruitiness to give it an interesting twist, definitely a really nice drink for a summer day.Right after our menus were taken and before we could head to the buffet, a server brought over some freshly fried squid. The squid was tender with a light coating on the outside. Even though we were trying to restrain ourselves so we could have more room for the buffet, the squid was quite good and we quickly gobbled this up.As we were polishing off the squid, a plate of beef gyoza came. Adam had one but stated that it wasn't anything special. I had one later on and thought they were comparable to frozen gyoza.When we came back from our first trek to the buffet, a steaming bowl of edamame was waiting at our table. It was a really nice service that they continued to bring these small bites (more squid came soon after!) but we knew their ploy was to bring the less expensive items to the table to try and prevent more eating from the buffet.After perusing the various hot and cold offerings available at the buffet, we both decided that our first plate would consist of mostly sushi and sashimi. All of the items were very fresh, as they had a slew of chefs consistently replenishing and replacing all of the 30 or so items at any given time. Additionally, the fish was of good quality - and not just for all you can eat. We also loved that they had various sashimi options available as well. The one item that really surprised us was the amaebi (sweet shrimp/spot prawn) which they had as both sushi and sashimi and wow, were these good! Whenever Adam and I saw them at the buffet, we tried it. However, by about 1pm (an hour into our time at Roka) they stopped serving the amaebi. Also, there seemed to less variety as well. This could definitely also have to do with the fact that by 1pm the place was quite full. So, if you're interested in having more options, we would definitely suggest getting there on the earlier side.I didn't find the octopus (too much sauce) or the sliced beef anything special and didn't end up getting more of that. However, the salmon sashimi sitting on a bed of shredded daikon and topped with a ponzu sauce was really nice and something that I usually had on most of my plates. Also, sashimi was a must on every trip as well since the options kept changing.For the rest of the review and photos: adamandvivian.com",

    "text": "Boy... Normally I can trust my fellow Yelpers, but this time I was definitely swayed in the wrong direction. Normally, I'm not one to Yelp immediately after eating at the venue, but I felt so strongly about this experience that I had to write my review up as soon as I could. In short. I'm not sure whether these other people had the same experience I had. The venue was only about half full. Definitely not overwhelming busy to where the servers or kitchen be stressed. I had to wait a fair amount before being able to catch a waiters eye to order my dinner. I ordered up two rolls, a fish dish, and fried tofu. Not too difficult right?The sushi took way too long to get prepared and delivered. Upon arrival, the sushi is just okay. It's nothing special and the rolls themselves are nothing incredibly creative. However, the few options they provide, they do them well. At least you know you won't be cheaped out like other low quality sushi places that use too much rice. Then they took the sushi plate away and I waited another 15 mins for my main dishes to arrive. Why did this take so long, I have no idea. It was a grilled fish and fried tofu! Once they were served, I was underwhelmed by the dishes. The fish was a bit too lightly seasoned for my taste, and the fried tofu's only saving grace was the sauce that came with the dish.Either way, considering the cost and delay in service, I will never be returning. There's a ton of other options available where you can get incredibly full to the point where your buttons are popping off your trousers. I left this place still feeling hungry! Never a good feeling.",

The black cod was my favourite, but absolutely everything was delicious. Worth coming here for special occasions, and seems to be less crazy than the Charlotte St branch. This would also be a good place to go for work lunches, being in the heart of Canary Wharf, and should please most discerning palates. My only complaint was that we couldn't get through the booze that came with our tasting menu fast enough!",

The food has never disappointed. This time I had the softshell crab, really good ,followed by the robata grilled sea bass, delicious. I love dessert, and a meal is not a good meal for me until I have dessert. I decided to try the almond cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e with cherry blossom ice cream... Excellent! I wanted more of it ...

    "text": "Best sushi in London.As the other reviews note, the address is correct, but the restaurant is located in Canary Wharf.This was my go-to choice for business dinners while working out in Canary Wharf. \u00a0Having moved to London from NYC, I was accustomed to walking by an outstanding sushi restaurant every 10 steps in NYC. \u00a0I was dumbfounded to learn that the sushi options in London were abismal at best, so my discovery of Roka was quite fortuitous!I think Roka would be classified as Asian Fusion, with the traditional sushi and sashimi options, but then also a more expansive seafood and meat menu. \u00a0The black cod is fantastic and I highly recommend the spicy edamame for an appetizer.I used to go here with folks from work and we'd order the larger sushi / sashimi sampler platters for the table and I was never disappointed. \u00a0Roka managed to do what seemed impossible in other London-area sushi restaurants - provide a variety of fresh and delicious sushis. \u00a0I feel like you can only get salmon sushi in London, so it was a breath of fresh air to have my usual tuna and yellow fin available again.Good ambiance in the restaurant, and definitely great for groups (looks like it caters to the Canary Wharf business crowd). \u00a0I do have to say that the service was severely lacking at this location. \u00a0I had been told that in general I shouldn't expect the same level of service in the UK as I was used to in the US, but I didn't find this to be the case overall. \u00a0Roka was the one restaurant that did live up to that poor expectation. Service aside - great sushi and highly recommended!",

We ordered an assortment of sushi, chicken wings and gyoza to start, then I had a rice dish for main. Whilst all was reasonably good, the best part really were the desserts. The two that we ordered to share were phenomenal and honestly, I would go back primarily for the desserts. Service was prompt, though I thought our waiter was rather curt and rough at times. All other servers were kind enough. Ambience was classy and spacious. Great for either corporate or social events. However, the noise level at times were too high. The restaurant overall felt quite crowded at peak times as well.",

    "text": "Roka is a little confusing to get to, in large part because there are two small elevators (with separate buttons, I might add) that are the only discernible way to get up to the restaurant, which is on the 3rd floor (or the 2nd, since ground floor = zero in these parts of the world). That said, once you step inside, you have a nicely-done, cosmopolitan and contemporary dining room in the back, along with a lounge space in the front that affords you views out onto Canary Wharf. I ended up out there, which was nice - during lunch, it has the hustle and bustle of a power lunch spot, but sitting in low chairs and relaxing easily in them, it can feel a bit more casual. The service was generally quite solid, although they did not bring one of our dishes out (the beef dumplings) in a timely fashion - definitely was forgotten at first. The drinks menu looked pretty solid, but as it was a weekday, I sadly did not try it out and stuck with water instead.I was a bit skeptical of the food here at first, largely because Zuma (which I went to several years back) was mediocre for the price point, and also because I was explained that edamame were peas by the waitress multiple times. It was more amusing - despite the internationalism of the city, clearly Londoners don't have the same familiarity with Asian cuisine that Americans do - but I wondered if it would lead to a 'fusion' experience that would lead to what most fusion food experiences do - confusion mixed with disappointment. That said, the food here is actually quite excellent, and in particular the small amount of sushi I tried. The sashimi (tuna and yellowtail) were quite excellent, with the tuna, with its deep red hue and rich creaminess, being a standout. The negitoro was simple and well-executed, and the crab roll was quite delicious - real, fresh crab was employed. The crab was also delicious in the dumplings; although it is definitely a fusion dish, the cold freshness of the crab meat really works well against the crispiness of the lightly fried gyoza. For hot plates, both the ribs and the pork belly were quite delicious; I liked that the pork belly was a cross-sectional cut so you could taste the meatier and the succulent parts in one bite. That said, it wasn't as fatty a piece as one might like. The ribs were also quite solid, and I appreciated the generous sprinkling of sesame seeds across the top. That said, the fusion influence was quite strong here, as evidenced by the heavy amounts of sauce that were heaped on the ribs. Still quite good, but the meat got a little lost among the sauce. To finish up, we split the crab hot pot. There was a hint of spice - due to some sliced-up peppers, from what I could divine - but it was very good, and I liked the thin noodles that were used. It was definitely a dish that felt more Vietnamese than Japanese, based on the flavor profiles.Overall, I definitely enjoyed the meal here, and with a cosmopolitan ambiance paired with Japanese sensibilities and decor, it was an excellent spot for a bite. The prices seemed reasonable (although I have to remember that 1 pound is about 1.25 US dollars), and for the quality of food, it is definitely worth a repeat visit whenever I am back in town next.",

    "text": "Had one of the most enjoyable meal in Roka! Went for the Weekend brunch menu. Tim, the waiter is very welcoming and friendly in introducing the menu and explaining how it works for the Brunch buffet. The tasting experience started with a choice of welcome drink, either a Bellini, Bloody Mary or green tea. I've chosen Bellini, the sips of sweet are refreshing. Then, I get to choose any appetizer from the counter, which includes lots of sushi, sashimi, soups and more. I don't really like sashimi, but I do give it a try and I'm glad that they are really fresh. It's tricky as there's so much to choose from the counter, but bear in mind that there's still main course and dessert, so don't overeat. For the main course, I ordered the baby back ribs glazed with spiced master stock and cashew nuts. I would rate a 5/5 for this dish. To me, it reminded me about Indonesian style baby ribs as the line gives a taste of sour along with the rich savory well marinated meat. A plus point is that there are complimentary free flow of wine throughout the meal. As a great dessert lover, I loved their dessert platter that consist of chocolate mousse, matcha and lychee pudding and assorted fruits. Their matcha and lychee pudding is superb, never have I thought of matcha and lychee will mix so well! I would say that the price worth the experience and food. It was so nice that the waiters will refold my napkins every time I leave to get food from the counter. The restaurant has great ambience but it's kinda tricky to find the entrance as there are two elevators that lead you to the restaurant.",

We also had black cod rice which had a long bone in it.

    "text": "I've been here for Brunch and was completely amazed so when I came here with a vendor for Lunch on a weekday, I'm really shocked why I've got such a bad taste in my mouth - literally.First the good stuff: \u00a0the service here is great, no doubt. \u00a0Hence why I gave the review two stars instead of one. The ambiance is nice, definitely like an upscale hotel inside. Loads of servers and very friendly.Now the bad stuff: \u00a0portion sizes. \u00a0seriously small pieces of sushi!! \u00a0I ordered hamachi sushi and the cut was tiny and was very dry! \u00a0Definitely not worth the price. \u00a0I also ordered the black cod/crab dumplings. Tasted great and after the 3rd one I was really liking it - that is until I bit on a crab shell (?!) \u00a0seriously shouldn't be happening in such an upscale restaurant - almost chipped a tooth! \u00a0Service was great and of course I got the dish replaced, but seriously this shouldn't happen.The rest of the meal was good - teriyaki salmon, black cod, and some other sides. All in all I'd say come here for the Brunch and skip the Lunch.",

The sushi was extremely good and it really was all you can eat, all you can drink, whilst still remaining sophisticated. We had the middle price brunch menu. In future I think I would just go for the cheaper one as the starters are so good and the cheaper main choices still looked very good. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Impressed and over-delivered from my expectations. I love this place- for the weekend brunch unlimited menu. I will definitely be back. I'm very skeptical with unlimited options at restaurants because quality is usually compromised for that quantity. Was not the case here. Quality was fantastic. Sushi was great- fresh, tasty, well made and didn't skimp on the fish. I've been to sushi restaurants where the rolls will have such a ridiculous ratio of rice than fish/fillings, but at Roka, there was just enough rice for taste and the rest you can actually taste the fish and ingredients within the roll. This was the first thing I noticed and appreciated. There were other options such as soups, heirloom tomato salad, chicken skewers, and other really well presented choices- which were good as well. From the kitchen option, I had ordered the steak and it was delicious. Juicy and seasoned. The only thing is was that it was a bit fatty. The staff noticed that we didn't finish and the manager came back and asked if we wanted another cut. We were blown away with the customer service. They had a lot of attention to detail and really made you feel like a valued customer. Don't really experience that in London so it did blow us away and we were so impressed and pleased. When it came to dessert, they had added a bit extra b/c of the steak. So nice and super great customer experience. Drinks were so delic. The green tea/passion fruit drink was amaaazing. The red wine was good as well. Very impressed b/c I was expecting a cheapy wine since it's unlimited flow. But quality was good and tasted good. The server was knowledgeable about the wine so that was appreciated and made the experience even better. Everything was so tasty and presentation was impressive for this brunch. Don't let the \"all you can eat\" deter you! Love this place and can't wait to be back!",

Great service, great vibe, great buffet and wines. We took the most expensive buffet option of \u00a366 (with champagne) and looking back the \u00a345 would have worked just as good, because you have unlimited access to the buffet too. Will definitely come back starving!",

This was definitely a scene or hotspot like Nobu but I didn't think the food was as good.I ordered the tuna tartar (excellent) and at the chefs advice ordered the baby chicken and sweet potato bamboo dish (both were good but not excellent). The service was okay but a lot of upselling which was frustrating in this setting. Also, the timing of dishes was off... For example, I received my dinner before my appetizer!Overall... It's good food but very expensive \u00a0for what it was.",

I was pleasantly surprised upon my arrival during a Friday lunch hour - the restaurant was buzzing with people and had an overall great vibe. I found the quality of sushi to be fantastic - which I was nervous about since a few people have commented that London doesn't have the best sushi, but honestly this was very good. We ordered a ton of stuff, but most notable in my opinion was the yellowtail sashimi salad and the miso black cod (it wasn't as good as Nobu's, but it was good!). The service was attentive and the food just kept on coming. I can't wait to come back!",
