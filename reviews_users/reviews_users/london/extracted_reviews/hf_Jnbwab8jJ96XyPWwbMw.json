I've heard other locations are awesome too.Definitely check out the gardens or request to sit there.In the summer I'm sure it gets crazy packed. We made reservations for lunch on a rainy Wednesday (no outside seating) and it was quite busy so make your reservations if you even think it will be remotely busy.",

Is bigger than the inside and dotted with cozy seating, water features and even fireplaces....will be a lovely setting for a summer drinks party! Exactly what the Kings road had been lacking- a cosy, destination restaurant! Well done!",

The food was really nice (we only got light bites/starters) like the arancini balls, fried zucchini, and wasabi prawns. The amount that comes in each starter is very generous (definitely very full by the end!) We even ordered more arancini balls because they were that good. My reason for not giving this place a 5 star rating is because I realised the following day, that they had forgotten to bring us our sourdough bread (that we had ordered) and also charged us for it lol. That was a bit sloppy and not expected from such a nice, Chelsea-based place! But will definitely go back many times; they got me addicted to those arancini balls!!! Mmm!",

Our reservation was for 9:30am and our whole party had finished their meals by 9:55am. Disappointing to say the least as the meals are obviously pre-cooked and heated up before being served... Although the waiters were helpful and friendly we also couldn't help but feel like there was constantly someone buzzing around us or checking our plates rather than just letting us enjoy our meal... Finally, our main purpose for visiting was to be able to enjoy the beautiful gardens. Unfortunately, you don't have this option at breakfast time & you have to be dining there for lunch.. We asked if we could sit out there for a cocktail after breakfast but was told \"no one is allowed there today because a party was booked\" which then shortly after, this was changed too \"only if you were eating lunch...\" On such a beautiful day, it's a real shame that the option to sit outside for breakfast wasn't available!",

This is quite a different sort of place, it's light and airy with decor based around the nearby Chelsea Physic Garden. Cocktails are reasonably priced and named after local icons. There is a good selection of small dishes, 'sandwiches' and reworked Ivy staples. The staff were perhaps a little over attentive - I'm not a big fan of being asked, mid mouthful, how my food is. The garden looks fabulous, but it was a little too overcast today to warrant a table outside. I will definitely be back soon with my husband for dinner, although finding a table in the foreseeable future may prove a challenge",

French style food, but not that great. the decor is beautiful and the outside patio is also very pretty. you feel like you are eating in a lush garden.We Ordered:1. Wild Mushrooms on toasted brioche: This was delicious! salted mushrooms came in a light cream sauce that had grated truffles and gran moravia.2. Smoked Salmon and crab: This smoked salmon was a nova sliced as a thin sheet piece. I am not a fan of the texture of nova or lox (prefer hot smoked salmon), so i did not care for this dish. My husband liked it! \u00a0 3. Chelsea Garden Fish Cake: I typically like fish cakes, crab cakes, anything with a cake. But this did not do it for me. The cake was large, but had no seasoning and had a fishy flavor. The texture was too pureed \u00a0for my liking on the inside. I prefer my cakes when i can still see chunks or lumps or crab or fish. It came with poached hens egg and hollandaise. don't think i would order this again.4. Steak, eggs, and chips: This was just okay. The steak had no flavor. Chips (fries) tasted fine, but needed salt (order the truffle fries next time).Overall, The service was great! Very charming ambience. The inside can get very loud bc it gets very busy. You need reservations, this place is very popular.",

Not just the interior, but the people also. All of the ladies are in lovely green dresses and the men in green vests. Having Garden in the name of course means that there has to be beautiful outdoor seating. I was really lucky to be able to enjoy brunch in the indoor patio, surrounded by lovely flowers and a view of the out door fire pit.Now the food - delicious!! First we started with cocktails - the Sloane Ranger for my husband and the Lavender Lady for me. Two of the best cocktails we've ever had. Because I was in London I ordered crumpets for the first time and omg so good. My husband tried one bite and in the end wound up eating the entire crumpet. For our mains we ordered coffee, eggs royale, eggs benedict with avocado and spinach, and a side of fruit salad. Yum!Definitely recommend The Ivy Chelsea Garden for anyone wanting a chic, beautiful, delicious brunch or lunch in Chelsea! Be sure to make your reservation ahead of time!",

    "text": "This is definitely the place where the fashionable and hip Chelsea set go and you can tell that immediately with an almost club like welcome at the front reception. There are two doors to The Ivy Chelsea one is from the street, the next is the door from reception into the restaurant and bar so you have to 'check-in' (and be checked out) by the host/hostesses who guard the door like bouncers, even if you are going for just cocktails. And there is definitely an airport style profiling before you go in... are you chic enough to enter? Let's see... Once inside the decor is lovely and delightful. An almost retro Chelsea chintz of green and pink with antique floral prints on the walls. It is pleasing and not at all dowdy yet you can't help but feel it is very grown up and indeed much of the clientele are the establishment of tailored suits and Hermes bags. But not to worry young trendsetters there is a place here for you too as many of the Made in Chelsea cast hang out here and indeed such luxe lifestyle bloggers and Instagramers as well sooooo that means it is the place du jour to be especially for brunches and champagne. And why not this place was made for Chelsea, refined, classic, and pretty, right on King's Road, why on earth didn't this happen sooner!?! Thankfully The Ivy Chelsea has the substance to back up the veneer as the food is quite simply wonderful. Tasty food, traditional menu with a bit of flare, and a good wine list make it a great place to actually go and EAT! The fish cakes are some of the best I've ever tasted, and the desserts... well the Chocolate Bomb with its spectacular presentation was scrumptious. In the warmer months there is garden seating which makes the restaurant even more appealing and I am sure everyone will be there during Chelsea Flower Show season. The bar has a great cocktail list and capable bartenders to make this a local watering hole. That is... if you can get past the front door...",

The Garden is just as amazing, also with fires. We weren't lucky enough to be in conservatory, but definitely want to make sure to head there again in spring & summer. Absolutely stunning. Brekkie/Brunch was lovely - amoungst ourselves we managed to try the Full English (lovely plate, all ingredients the best quality, but the black pudding was the size of a two pound coin - they could have been a little more generous), the Garden Breakfast, Avocado, Tomato & Sesame & The Avocado & Spinach Eggs Benedict. Quick note on cost - keeping in mind we didn't drink alcohol, it was crazy cheap! Definitely not what I expected! Always a good surprise! Overall, the food was good, nothing extraordinary but good. And the decor was stunning. I highly recommend for a special occasion or not necessarily!",

Pros:- The service was great, it was attentive and polite. - Great atmosphere and decor. The Ivy is vibrant and busy, but not in a loud obnoxious wayCons:- The food - all of it- The toast was brought out well before the dishes so we were left with cold toast to eat- The eggs benedict was poorly presented and prepared. The watercress was clumsily thrown on and the shredded ham was lacking in flavor- The muffins on the egg bendedict was truly terrible. One of the worst I've had- The veggie full breakfast left a lot to be desired as well. The beans seemed to be straight from Heinz (which is fine for home but I'd expect more at a restaurant). The eggs had a school cafeteria look and feel to themI'm not sure if dinner is better, but given the poor quality of brunch I doubt I'll come back to try it.",

    "text": "My heart sank on reading the menu. Burgers and fish and chips? Brasserie standards. Meh. However, in reality, there's a bit more to it, although it is true that the menu is fairly middle-of -the-road. Warm duck salad was very good, as were scallops with fennel and grapefruit. Rump steak was excellent, as was the lemon sole. The only \"showy\" item we found was on the dessert menu- the chocolate bombe arriving with a warm praline sauce that causes structural collapse on the chocolate shell. A bit of a shame, in some respects, as you just end up with an amorphous ( but delicious) swamp.Tea, lunch, and brunch menus are also available.The wine list is good- actually far more extensive than merited by the narrow menu. Some nice (relative) oddities in there, like a good Prinz bob Hessen Riesling (2013). Lots of good stuff around the \u00a330/bottle mark.As to the restaurant itself- well , you may well want to be in the garden room with the hedgies, foreign plutocrats, and other glossy denizens of Chelsea, although it has to be said most of them are basically there to look at themselves. There are about a million staff- most of the wait staff are very good, and service is generally attentive ( until it gets busy).Front of house is manned by that special breed of decorative but inexplicably arrogant person who gets off on asking people if they've booked ( well, I suppose it's do this or work in Daddy's gallery).All in all, an unchallenging eaterie for the fairly well heeled- the sort of place you might go with a wealthy, elderly aunt. Won't scare the horses, sort of thing. Absolutely nothing wrong with that in and of itself, but you can't help but feel it could be a bit more...well, adventurous on the menu front.",

I had the 'mushrooms on toast', the roast chicken and the treacle tart and it was all delicious - each course was also beautifully presented. Make sure you try the chocolate bomb too, my friend had this and as well it was being delicious it was lovely having the waiter pour the hot sauce over the solid chocolate case and watching it melt away to reveal the dessert. Highly recommend for dinner or brunch in Chelsea - a little expensive but definitely worth the price!",

I don't tend to go for Gordon Ramsay but I was walking along Kings Road on a Thursday night with a friend and there didn't seem to be many other enticing places, so we went in here.What did we get?Excellent service. No really, like proper effort put in. I felt genuinely welcomed.Nice atmosphere. There was a buzz and people were happily chatting away. The decor wasn't over the top and it wasn't too plain either. It had a classy feel but still had a bit of a buzz to it. Again, well done.Food... well, ok, again, yes it was very good. But the portion was pretty small.Wine... Very good selection, but this is where you really feel your wallet pinch. The place would actually be much nicer for me if they didn't quadruple the price of the wine, and that's why it's dropping a star.OK, so yeah... it seems I am a fan! Yay!",

Unfortunately the service and the food did not match up. My husband and I arrived 20 minutes early to our reservation and were told to wait. We waited and waited...which I figured was fine since we were early. But then we watched people come in and be seated over and over again until it was well past our reservation time. A few staff members even asked us if we were still waiting so I knew were weren't forgotten about...so that was odd. We ordered the HLT sandwich and the French Dip. Both were good but not wow. The chips however were delicious, perfectly crispy and fluffy. I wouldn't go back because of the food and service but the place really is something to see, especially out in the garden.",

We made lunch reservations and were seated in the back near the garden which was lovely. We ordered two appetizers- the seasonal pumpkin soup and the mushroom cream toast. Both were excellent! We also got coffee and early Grey tea which were great. However, I ordered a cocktail as well and they brought me an iced tea. I questioned two people if it was the right thing and they said it was. Finally, 20 minutes later the waiter realized I was right and brought me the cocktail. For our mains we ordered the truffle chicken sandwich and the burger. Both were very yummy. However, the waiter seemed to not know much about the dishes, just said they were \"nice\" and couldn't give much details, hence the semi-boring orders on our part. Overall, it was a nice lunch, but didn't knock it out of the park.",

The food is very good and generous! The quantities are nice, it's not too much! I can't wait to go back through summer time to have lunch in the garden this time!",

The Chocolate Bombe is a must! Also the vegetarian options are satisfying and nutritious. The courgette fries must also get a mention, they come in a large basket and thus are perfect to share. I hope you learn to live this chain just as much as I do.",

We tried to go in one night to have a drink at the bar (which looked empty) and he said that we need to have a table reservation, when we asked if we could wait for the bar area seating he told us we had to wait outside and started to roll his eyes at me and my husband telling us that we had to leave speaking to us in a \u00a0very ill manner. Because we wanted to try the food we went back with reservations on another night and he was there again and refused to greet us at the door and snubbed us, anyway the food is decent but the ambiance is perfect. \u00a0I wouldn't go back here for the pure fact that the restaurant manager treats the clientele like he is too good for them - not how I want to be treated when I go out to fine dining.",
