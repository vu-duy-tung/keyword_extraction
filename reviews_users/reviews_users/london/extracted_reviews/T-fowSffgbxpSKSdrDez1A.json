    "text": "I absolutely agree with those who call this place a delight - it's very apt. The atmosphere, the light decor and the food are all lovely and soul-enhancing especially on a hot day or when the sun's shining. I would say that one problem lies in the fact that if it's greay and dark or especially cold the vibe of this place isnt quite so appealling. The problem stems from the fact that it has sucha narrow Nicoise focus that the menu is geared towards a Med climate - and I dont know if they've noticed but we dont get much of that here. The food is still good though and I'd suggest that they cook fish here better than perhaps any other restaurant in this part of town. I love the way they encourage you to share everything too.",

    "text": "Eagerly anticipated my first visit to La Petite Maison, being a fan of its parent in Nice (and the scary patronne, Nicole) and went for an early lunch - which was just as well, as the place had been booked up for later sittings several days before. The signature dish - poulet aux fois gras - is a large black-leg chicken stuffed with fois gras for two and must be ordered in advance, which I duly did - and then fielded no less than four calls on my mobile before I reached the restaurant, to determine if I was still coming (I was - and on time) and then the exact time that it should be served. Very correct - but a touch uber-enthusiastic nevertheless. We started with the famous salade d'artichauts - roughly chopped artichoke with parmesan - perhaps a little too much parmesan this time - washed down with a first-rate Sancerre Prestige. When the poulet came it was superb - and impressively substantial (see photo). I remember little of the rest of the meal as my companion is invariably entertaining but I noted that the menu was a replica of the Nice carte and had on it such dishes as loup de mer en croute de sel for which one formerly had to invest in ticket on the Blue Train to consume. The service was accomplished if not as memorable as in Nice, and the large bright room bore a contented lunchtime buzz and the smell of success.",

    "text": "I was told about this place when I was at a private cooking course, and one of the more fun people I was cooking with mentioned this one one of her favorite places to eat in London. I put it on the list. Then a few weeks later, my parents were in town, and we happened to see it, so decided to check out the menu. Unfortunately, my dad zeroed in on the \u00a360 stuffed chicken and quickly vetoed the idea. (We had been at some fairly expensive places during the week.) We tried to explain it was a WHOLE chicken and served more than one, but he was going to have none of that!Fast forward to almost a year later. I had to get some nice shoes, so on Good Friday we headed into central London. Since we live in the suburbs, we often don't get the chance to dine in London, and we took the opportunity to go out for a nice meal. We managed to get last minute reservations at 6:30 for two people (of which they would need the table again at 8:30). It was surprisingly empty when we arrived, considering they claimed the 6:30 booking was the last available time. To be fair, it was fully seated by the time we left. We looked over the menu and the wine. I ordered the beignets (not like Louisiana style, but really fried squash blossoms) and the other half ordered the scallop carpaccio. They told us there was a strict \"everything comes out when its ready\" policy. That sounded fine. The beignets arrived. We both tried it, and I slowly worked my way through, feeling incredibly guilt that I was the only one eating and also not wanting my deliciously warm, crunchy, fried squash to get cold and disgusting. I finished. No carpaccio. It finally came out a bit later, and it looked amazing. (It was amazing). The mains were rib eye steak (for me which I tried to order rare, but the waitress recommended that it might better medium rare) and orange duck (for him). The beef was actually quite rare, so perhaps ordering rare would have been a bit too much. Needless to say the meal was quite tasty.The desserts really shined! I ordered a banana sticky toffee with peanut foam (and boy, was it peanuty, and delicious). He ordered warm chocolate mousse (which sounded strange, but was really just like a giant, runny, delicious souffle). Pair that up with some Maury, and it was a great time to be had.There was a nice rustic and laid back feel. Even though it says dressy above, most people were dressed casually. There were some amazing looking heirloom tomatoes on the table which I cut into as part of the starter. The bread was also quite tasty, delivered sliced and warm to the table. All in all, it was a great time. The only letdown was the lack of timing in the kitchen. I know they say things come when they're ready, but you'd think that (like most kitchens), there should be some way of timing things a bit better. To fix that next time, we'll probably just order starters to share, then it doesn't matter which come out first (which, to be honest, is probably the intention of the restaurant). Everyone was completely friendly, even when I asked them about the Eisch wine glasses. I was curious if they were the ones that were supposed to have breathable glass (which apparently now may be a false claim). No one knew what I was talking about. It was also quite fun bantering with the hostess about her stealing my new shoes. I'm definitely going back again.",

    "text": "For photos see the Greedy Diva @ greedydiva.blogspot.com/\u2026  The Peanut Gallery and I spent last weekend eating and guffawing our way around Paris, in our own special tres chic style. TPG even grew a fine, curly 'tache for the occasion. Special Greedy Diva highlights are coming soon. However, suffice to say, many gallons of butter, animal fat and lashings of cream later, I'm not sure my body can cope with more French fare. I can still feel the eclairs au chocolat pulsing through my veins. Fortunately, the menu at La Petite Maison holds promise of fresh, Nicoise cuisine - a bounty of seafood and grilled meats, vegetables, salads and Ligurian oils. A taste of the Mediterranean diet should be just what the doctor ordered. Set on Brooks Mews in a quiet Mayfair cul-de-sac, La Petite Maison is a bright, buzzy, quintessential French brasserie based on a restaurant of the same name (and holding high regard) in Nice. Classic and classy, it's easy to see how it won Tatler's Best Room Award in 2008. It was brought to London by one of the owners of Roka and Zuma, but despite its position in the heart of the well heeled and sometimes stuffy streets of Mayfair, it's surprisingly relaxed and fun. Plates are meant to be shared (although you can just as easily stick to your own if you're not a sharer - perfectly understandable) which enhances the informality, despite the elegance of the food. For me, it's love at first sight. The infatuation only increases as the food arrives. Friends Kerry, Ben, Sarah and Tim join The Peanut Gallery and I as we devour plate after plate of truly delightful fare. As we fawn over the menu, thick slices of crusty bread are continually replenished on the table before us. A large bowl of grassy, green hued Ligurian olive oil takes centre stage on the table along with lemons and tomatoes to be sliced and rubbed into the bread in rustic tradition. We share delicate starters of carpaccio of scallop and a superb dish of thinly sliced octopus in lemon oil which was truly a taste sensation. We're already working ourselves up into quite a flutter. We pair up these lighter choices with some deep fried courgette flowers, with sage, anchovy and onions, and pots of deep fried baby squid which were both perfectly adequate, although proferring slightly less to get het up about. We also decide to share our mains - essentially, of course, out of a spirit of curiousity, gluttony and hedging our bets than any mightier principle of generosity. I choose the turbot with artichokes, chorizo, white wine and olive oil. It's delectable. It's been cooked in stock with vegetables, and is meaty, succulent and satisfying. Tim and TPG each choose the grilled rib eye steak which turns out to be a fantastic piece of Scottish beef, grilled perfectly medium rare and cut into thick, mouthwatering strips to share. The grilled veal chop is gorgeously creamy, while the grilled lamb chops with smoked aubergine are tender and pink. With all this, we share sides of green beans and crisp fries. Usually, there's at least one dud in a field of so many. But it was impossible to pick a winner. There's a clear leader on the dessert front as far as I'm concerned - and thankfully, it's mine. The warm chocolate mousse with malt ice-cream is so good I want to clear the room, find the vessel its stored in, and take a head first dive. Even TPG who has an annoyingly inexplicable aversion to chocolate mousse agrees it rocks. His thin apple tart with vanilla ice cream looks a little on the light side, although he wolfed it down before I had the chance to try. The pear clafoutis was eggy and scrumptious (according to the eggy dessert lovers among us - such things are not my first choice, but it was lovely even to me). I'm mentally preparing for a revisit already, even if only to try what must surely be a heavenly black leg whole chicken with foie gras (the aforesaid chook has been much hyped by reviewers in the past, which may or may not be a good sign). La Petite Maison is not cheap - expect Mayfair prices (at around \u00a360 per head for us plus drinks). But every dish was fantastic, as was our wine from the largely French wine list. This is high class, rustic, wholesome fare - set in a chic, flirtateously French ambience. Somewhere for a romantic tete a tete, or a wine guzzling extravaganza with like minded friends, it's got it all. (Except the Nice foreshore.)",

The white tables were starting to fill up and it seemed that quite a few groups were out on business dinners. We ordered Coquilles St. Jacques as an appetizer. Perhaps my Father's version is different, but I was not expecting this dish to come out the way that it did, which was a sort of congealed flattened thing. None the less it was still tasty, but certainly not what I was expecting. For our main courses: I ordered the Salt Baked Sea Bass, my boyfriend ordered a steak, and we split a bottle of wine that I can not remember the name of. The food was delicious!My overall experience of La Petite Maison was very pleasant. The food was expensive but worth it and our waiter was very friendly and helpful.

    "text": "Well La Petite maison did not disappoint, a really good news for Mediterranean food lovers in London. First when it launched I was skeptical and did not run to try it in spite of the PR buzz. On the contrary, I hate this kind of so obvious PR-led editorial enthusiasm that announces the launch of the new restaurants in London from those who can afford big PR budgets. But with a good friend in town we decided to give it a go and frankly we had a great time. The vast choice of mainly typically Mediterranean and nicois starters and main courses can be shared between guests (you can safely order 2 or 3 of them for 4 people), all were really tasty and well prepared. I have to confess that I am biased as I am from Nice and for me this is one of the best cuisine in the world, but the London version delivers excellent food and just misses a bit of the excentric authenticity of the original version (those who know the owner in Nice will know what I mean). Upmarket clientele, not cheap but quality food in a nice surrounding, so try it and tell me what you think about the nicoise cuisine! Update: Just tried it again yesterday evening outside on their terrasse. This is great as you dont need to book. Perfect service and food. I upgraded to 5 stars and one of my top places in London. Update 2: Back again and still Numero Uno - Best restaurant in London, better than the original version in Nice, only negative that I had to order in English while I can order in French in most places in London these days, come on just stick to local nicois and nicoises for the service and I give you 6 stars on Qype!",

    "text": "Fantastic service and food all around. The fish game in particular was on point. Arriving at 6pm, the place really began picking up at about 6:30 and got packed from then on on a Friday night. We ordered a bit of everything and it came out when ready which is fine for tapas but at an upscale establishment with multiple diners it makes everything more awkward. This would be my only complaint. We began with the yellowtail carpaccio, squid carpaccio, burrata, calamari, and prawn. Burrata was very chewy and perfectly coupled with fresh tomatoes (of which there were two ripe ones on the table as well to cut and eat as you like). The yellowtail was exceptional sashimi and would rival top sushi joints. Calamari was cooked just right. \u00a0It super fried but enough to soak in the line and jalape\u00f1os. For entrees we had the chicken, John Dory, sea bass, and full fish. The full fish was enough for two and honestly could have served three. It was shown and then deboned and served. Really nice cut and presentation and tasty on top. The chicken was a pass; very basic and just a well cooked rotisserie. The sea bass and John Dory were both thick and juicy and exceptional. Fish is the way to go at Petit. The shared dishes are nice, but experimenting with all the ocean varieties they offer would be recommended in my mind. Expensive at at least 35 pounds an entree but it will fill you up and leave you satisfied. We additionally shared the largest crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e I've ever had. Tasted more of an ice cream than your typical base. Very good and great shareable ending. Wine list was large but a few options under 50 if you're looking to drink at a moderately reasonable price. Dinner was great. Food was on point and service was always as it was needed. Pricy to say the least, but given the quality and the location, a nice meal out was worth the Petit bill.",

We started with the white truffle pasta 120 pounds. A special dish but I would say the macaroni was to heavy for the delicate shaved truffles. We tried to request linguine but you know how Chefs do not like you to modify their dishes. The duck and Dover Sole were amazing. Fancy restaurant but they put your bread on the table and leave out a tomato and lemon for you to cut and eat, was interesting. In the picture was a glass if amazing wine, steep in price but worth it!",

    "text": "Good enough but more about style over substance.This popular Mayfair eatery looks quaint and inviting from its little mews street. And first impressions inside are that of a small slice of Paris in London with zinc bar and glass curtains. I first came here a few years ago when it was 'the' place for all the pretty people to hang out. Saw Naomi Campbell there too. But I never went back because I thought then, in its hay day as I do now, that it is nice enough but not really all that. Yet I returned with a friend who loves the place and since it had been a while I went in with fresh eyes but unfortunately left with no better feelings for it. First of all the service could have been better. We asked for many things more than once. Food arrival was slow and we spent a lot of time waiting. While polite, there were still incidents such as when asking for a glass of wine suggestion to accompany the main course, the waiter just pointed to the wine menu. It just could have been better. And what is with giving you one slice of bread? Can't you leave a bread basket on the table? When we asked for more, it took ages and had to ask again. By the time it arrived the need of the bread to accompany my friend's dish was unnecessary.The menu I would describe as a glamorized and slightly English take on a classic French bistro menu. It has the usual favourites like a nice steak fritte but here it was a Rib Eye steak and the frittes were chips you ordered as a side, not included with the steak. Instead of a Bearnaise sauce there was horseradish. So not exactly the same old same old which might have been a good thing, except in all honesty I can't say I enjoyed it better than just hitting a standard brasserie. It was all good, but far from amazing. And at those prices it should be. I usually don't quibble about the cost of things, but here I have to say it was way over priced for what they were offering. I didn't even have a starter or a dessert which I usually do, but with 2 glasses of wine and the main it was still as much as going to a Michelin starred restaurant but without the innovative menu or wow factor. It is all a pleasant enough dinning experience, and if you are in the area, why not stop in. But I wouldn't go out of your way to go there as there are just much better places.",

    "text": "I've had a few friends mention this as their favorite restaurant in London, so when one of them was in town, we decided to go on a Thursday evening.The restaurant recommends that you order starters and mains to share, and they guided to 5-6 starters and 3-4 mains for a group of 4 people. Since we were a group of 4 girls, we settled on less and got 4 starters and 3 mains and 1 side dish, which I thought was more than enough.For starters, we got the French beans with foie gras, the ratatouille, burrata and tomatoes, and the escargots. I thought the French beans were disappointing, having read about them on a few reviews. I didn't really taste the foie gras, as they were served as cubes tossed with the beans, and you didn't get the same enjoyment as you would have if they had just served a block of foie gras to accompany some bread. I also didn't like that the dish was served cold. The ratatouille was also rather lackluster, as it was just some stewed soft vegetables on a plate but with no particular outstanding flavor. I really enjoyed the burrata and the escargots, especially the sauce that came with the escargots which I can't put my finger on but is more than the typical butter sauce... a type of pesto, perhaps.For our mains, we ordered the grilled sea bream, grilled lamb cutlets, and the roast baby chicken. We also got a side of the potato gratin, which was simply amazing. The roast baby chicken was a flattened piece of chicken, not very large, and easy to cut into 4 pieces that were about a few bites each. It was very moist and well seasoned. I liked the herbs that came with the sea bream, but other than that it was a fairly average fish dish. And the grilled lamb cutlets were good, but not particularly noteworthy.For dessert, we decided on the creme brulee, which is a very large portion and enough to share for up to 6 people. We were very impressed to see a layer of fresh vanilla on the bottom of the dish, and the custard portion was absolutely delicious.All in all, the bill came to 50 pounds a person, including a bottle of red wine to share, which whilst not cheap, was better than I had expected. I thought the food was good but I wouldn't say that this is at the top of my personal list of favorite restaurants.",

Otherwise we went long periods of waiting: Waiting for waiters, waiting for menus, waiting for an extra napkin, waiting for someone to take our order, waiting for someone to offer more bread. The food was just alright. I had a roast chicken and lemon dish, while my friend had a \u00a0huge steak. The latter was the highlight of the meal. It was perfection: well-seasoned and tender. My friend was left a bit disappointed as he preferred his steak medium-rare, but it was just under. The tender stem broccoli was good, as were the chips, though nothing out-of-this-world. We passed on dessert, as nothing stood out and we had a show to catch. Again, the service left something to be desired. Our waiter was brusque, and even commented that we would have gotten the full experience had we ordered starters and dessert and coffee, instead of mains and wine only.Since this was not dinner on the cheap and I found the statement rather curious, but perhaps something was lost in translation.",

    "text": "If giving this place ZERO stars was possible, I would. Had the worst experience here. Our waitress had extreme attitude. Unfriendly and uninterested. The place was out of a few things from the menu which kind of sucked considering the only reason we went was because my wife had heard great reviews from friends that have dined at the one in Dubai, and those things were not available the night we were there (in London). Ordered the gnocchi, carpaccio of yellow tail, tiger prawns and steak. The tiger prawns were good, but as a main course, 2 prawns sliced in halves (so technically you have 4 pieces) is not enough. Even if you order a starter. Way overpriced for what it was.The waitress was so hostile that we didnt even bother looking at the dessert menu and decided to leave. When we got back to our hotel, my wife noticed she had a voice mail from the restaurant a few hours before our reservation. The lady in the message had said that she had to cancel our reservation because there was a fire in the kitchen and the restaurant was closed for the evening. Obviously we didn't hear the message in time, and still went to the restaurant. That might explain why they didn't have certain items available from the menu, but why did she lie about the restaurant being closed and that she had to cancel our reservations??? The restaurant was packed when we got there, and packed when we left. So clearly they weren't closed.Don't worry la petite maison, you didn't want us to come, we will not be going back.",

    "text": "Had several dinners there since the opening and finally got to write a note on LPM. \u00a0In my opinion, one of the top french restaurants in London. \u00a0The only \"problem\" with the restaurant is the abundance of equally excellent choices on the menu. \u00a0My favorites are:- Pissaladi\u00e8re- Haricots Verts with Foie Gras- \u00a0Salad of young artichokes (in season) - \u00a0Tapenade- \u00a0Cod Provencale- \u00a0Lechato lamb, - \u00a0and of course duck a l'orangeFor desserts, Pan Perdu and marinated prunes are very well worth the calories.Reservations are required, the restaurant is very busy.",

    "text": "Wonderful service, beautiful restaurant... I went here on a business lunch and was recommended by a colleague to just order starters and share. As well as being able to taste more on the menu this also meant it was more social and we could discuss the food we were sharing. So... we tried the onion tart.... to die for, think thin pastry bottom with an onion puree on top, topped with two tiny slices of anchovy and an olive. Salty, sweet... yum. Then came the tuna carpaccio. Fresh, beautiful fish- faultless. Artichoke salad came thinly sliced and accompanied the other starters beautifully. Minced veal stuffed in mini vine roasted tomatoes and courgettes. Mmmmm.... courgette flowers deep fried and stuffed with anchovy- !!!! Finally king prawns done in olive oil. Simple, the unfussy cooking allowed the prawn to speak for itself!I would definately recommend this place but it is pricey. Go for a special occasion or book your table to coincide with pay day!",
