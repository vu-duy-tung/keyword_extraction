The ambience is informal and gently romantic with the West End buzz outside. I definately go again.

I had never heard of it, it must be one of Soho's best kept secrets, but my friends managed to get a reservation and I was glad they did, it is such a good find! Some websites say it is the most romantic restaurant in London, which it would be if you were sat on the Ground Floor, however in the basement you sit to close together for it to be romantic! The menu changes daily and has fresh ingredients and some really interesting combinations, so a great place for food- and wine lovers. I would definitely go on a date here or bring a good friend for a catch up. Reserve a week in advance though, it gets booked up quickly!",

    "text": "Andrew Edmunds is a quaint European restaurant in SoHo in London. I had heard of Andrew Edmunds from friends before and it is quite highly rated on Zagat so decided to book dinner for a friend that had just moved to London that evening. When we arrived at Andrew Edmunds, we were surprised to see that the restaurant is around 8 tables or so that are closely packed (reminded me quite a lot of a small restaurant in Southern France). The decor is quite romantic with used wine bottles corked with candles burning on the table, a chalk board with up to date wine specials, and a handwritten menu. The wine list is phenomenal - they source their wine list from high-end retailers in London and buy the last few bottles of a bin at a significant discount. They truly pass along the discount to the costumer - bottles begin around \u00a318 for their house red Corbieres and upward to hundreds of pounds for known vintages of French, Italian, Spanish, Australian, and Napa/Sonoma wines. The menu is filled with classically French and British dishes that are simple but well crafted. We decided on the winter stew, lemon sole, and lentil and aubergine for the three mains, along with the charcuterie for an appetizer, and the cheese plate for dessert. The Corbieres was splendid (and reasonably priced) and the mains were surprising great (plus, the price point was from \u00a312.50 for the lentils to \u00a322 for the sole, so quite reasonable for SoHo). The cheese dish was sourced from local farms outside of London and was one of the nicest cheese plates I have had in a long time. As an aside, Andrew Edmunds does not do online reservations and does not accept them more than a week in advance. Calling for reservations 3 or more days in advance is quite recommended in order to get a spot (especially for the weekends). The staff were attentive and helpful in selecting a dish, but were also not too hovering, so we felt we could sit for as long after our meal as we wished. The dishes were also well-timed, so courses did not overlap. Overall, Andrew Edmunds was a splendid restaurant. If you are looking for a higher end French/European restaurant to take a date or to catch up with good friends, Andrew Edmunds is a great choice.",

I would have walked right past the sedately decorated restaurant with candles quivering in the windows without realising it was even there if had I not been led in by the hand. Along with paper table cloths, fresh flowers in jars and cutlery that could have been swiped from a local school we were squeezed in to a delightfully cosy and intimate corner. The staff were attentive and even though it was a busy friday evening our food came pretty quickly. The whole experience was a sheer delight to the taste buds. On the smiley waitresses' recommendation I ate octopus and chorizo salad to start and lamb shank with dauphinoiuse potatoes for main. Places like this are hard to find; exceptional quality food at reasonable prices with a fabulous wine list served with no pretentions. Now on the 4th date but AE is a hard act to follow!

    "text": "It's quite amazing, in fact almost embarassing that in all my years of dining in Soho I had yet to make it to Andrew Edmunds. I have booked to go lots of times but always ended up cancelling so yesterday when I needed a french restaurant in the area I decided that this time I would go having heard so many great things. First impressions were very very good, despite calling on the day and requesting a table for 8.30pm they were really accommodating and didn't bat an eye lid when rather cheekily despite the tardiness of the booking I requested a corner table. For the record when we got there every table was full with two sets of two waiting. I arrived at 8.15pm to be greeted by a lovely lady who advised me that there was a table ready but if had a drink at the bar she could give a much better corner table as per my request.....I had a Kir whilst waiting for my date and looked around the restaurant....it was gorgeous...lots of pretty, well heeled types who looked even prettier by candle light all very much enjoying the 'restaurant equivalent to cuddle' that is Andrew Edmunds. We were shown downstairs with menus at 8.30pm on the dot and I was a little underwhelmed as I'd read on various websites that downstairs is not as nice as upstairs......not a bit of it.....it was beautifully lit with lots of candles with a lovely gentle buzz of conversation and clinking glasses....this has to be (along with Julies's) one of the most romantic restaurants in town. To the food.....We shared starters, goose liver rillets with toasted home made rye bread and one the freshest dressed crabs I've eaten in long time with a simple home made mayonnaise....both simple but perfect. My date then had the line caught cod with spinch and mashed potato....the cod was so fresh and plump it was practically still quivering simply cooked but exquisite...the quality of the ingredients sang through right down to the last mouthful of perfectly seasoned mash. I hadn't eaten a thing all day and was starving so took a chance with the Cassoulet....the last time I had it was in Brasserie Lipp in Paris so perhaps I'm being a little unfair but it was the only low point of the evening...it lacked body and the components were all wrong....the sausage which was reminscent of an English banger was undercooked and quite hard whilst the meat, which I think was beef was if anything overcooked and very stringy and the beans not cooked enough... That apart....I loved the restaurant and will go back again and again.....we didn't have room for pudding but they looked gorgeous....with a decent bottle of rose, two aperitifs and service the bill came to around 70 quid. Our waiter was lovely and kept checking that all was ok as though he really cared. Andrew Edmunds is everything is cracked up to be and in fact is a little nicer. The people who own/run it make it a really good experience.",

    "text": "Dark, cosy and romantic. It's a restaurant that wraps you up in a slightly sexy cuddle, like a beautiful older French lady wearing her lover's jumper. Imagine a ramshackle and quaint bistro, with disarmingly efficient and yet laid back staff, a wine list curated by someone with a keen eye for a bargain and fantastically fresh, unstuffy fare prepared from whatever the chef feels is best at the market that week. The menu is handwritten before being photocopied, the wine list changes weekly. Paper cloths, mis-matching furniture and spluttering wine bottle candlesticks certainly aren't contrived, but certainly won't help win them a star.With such atmosphere, it's all we can do to stop ourselves ripping our clothes off then and there, but I didn't get the stomach I've got today by ignoring my basest food based desires at the exclusion of all others, so we dived into the menu instead. Firm fleshed smoked eel comes with beetroot chutney and horseradish cream, complex but perfectly balanced mix of sharp and milky smooth flavour and soft but crunchy texture. I also somewhat share my obliging guest's cauliflower and cumin fritters. A firm patty fried and served with a delicate raita.The mains follow a similar rustic tack. There's nothing too challenging here, though the kitchen isn't afraid of a little nose to tail eating, when appropriate. A muscular and resolutely unthreatened hunk of fresh cod wearing a cape of herbs reclines royally on a bed of wilted spinach and tomato coated broad beans. It's not elegant, but my god does it taste good. And that's what little I managed to scavenge from under my guest's now watchful eyes.An Angus beef shepherd's pie on the lunchtime menu didn't make it as far as the evening, I was smugly informed by our waiter it had wound up as the staff lunch. A shame, as I'd had my eye on it since walking past earlier and seeing it on the board outside. Um'ing and ah'ing between a seafood paella, heaving with langoustine and shellfish, and a lamb shank I was finally able to kick the menu Tourettes and dug into one of the best bits of throwaway lamb I can remember. Sinking into a quicksand of pureed potato, it bravely clung onto a thick branch of perfectly cooked cabbage. To no avail, I drowned it in a thick gamey gravy and slowly stripped the soft, succulent meat from the thick bone.Sated, though with just enough room to share a treacle tart from the trencherman's list, the end of the excellent rose Sancerre turned my thoughts to matters romantic once more. We gazed at each other over the drippy candle and sighed... deeply... There's no doubt that the mood and the food provokes, but like Macbeth's porter and his wine, while it provokes the desire its sheer volume takes away any possibility of the performance.Reservations are only taken a week out, which is useful to know, and I find the upstairs a (tiny) bit more pleasant than the seating downstairs. Just don't ask for my table, or I'll really have to kill you.",

The restaurant itself is small and getting a booking is hard enough as it is, but when you get there, if you're greeted by the middle-aged female server, you'll think you're an unwelcome guest. She dished out attitude better than wine recommendations and huffed and tutted past our perfectly civil table several times. Out waitress was actually a new girl who was a lot younger and she was wonderful, it was just the head woman who seemed to hate her job and made it very clear. It's such a shame as I'd love to recommend this place, but with her front of house, it's like sending a lamb into a lions den. She's up for a fight - terrifying when all you're looking for is a quite meal out with friends mid-week. If I were you, I'd go somewhere else, unless of course you are desperate to try the food here. Andrew Edmunds, heed this advice, put this PMT-infused woman back of shop, she obviously does not want to be here and makes walking into the establishment a below par experience.",

From the outside it's small and unassuming which means you may easily pass by without asecond glance, but locals like myself aswell as other food lovers know that if you want good, honest food cooked reallywell then this is a winner every time. It's been here for years and has an oldSoho feel to the place that I love with its faded front leading into a warm, familiarground floor with happy chattering tables enjoying a slice of Soho life. The oldscuffed wooden floors and little staircasewith its worn banister leading down to the basement offers a few more tables of various sizes and a moresubdued space \u00a0ideal for catch ups between old friends or new lovers ( I firstcame here on a date- that later became my husband for a few years!).Note- good tablemanners or very close friends areessential as elbow room on some tables is limited (this made for lots offootsie and diving onto other peoples plates to try what they were having easier for us). It all makes for a very cosy,fun time out; I seem to always come here with my very dearest friends. It'sreasonable (there were 6 of us and we paid about \u00a350 each with starters, main,very good puddings plus wine). Do try the black pudding with poached duck eggon a herby fritter or the Cornish Brill, the haddock risotto was also extremelygood and the rabbit was very tasty and nice to see on the menu \u00a0In fact it'sall delicious whatever you pick. As it was a cold night this menu was perfectwith its winter fare feel to it (but lighter options like my Brill meant therewas something for everyone)",

The menu was hand written and from what I was told, it changed quite often which is pretty great. I am going to be honest and say I don't quite remember the name of what I ordered but I can say it was absolutely delicious and left me wanting more. The waitstaff is great and attentive despite the business of the place, and it's in a great location and easily accessible.

It's an old standard amongst all the trendy young things that are popping up. It's an intimate venue for a cozy dinner or a larger group. The food was good but inconsistent. The squid and fennel starter was delicious and the squid perfectly tender but the fennel overcooked. \u00a0The braised lamb breast was a nice fatty cut of meat that fell off the bone but it came with a only a few of the white beans promised on the menu and looked a bit forlorn on the plate. The desserts were good, particularly the hazelnut ice cream. I quite liked the ginger pudding although someone at our table thought it has too much ginger. The wine list is excellent. We had some delectable wine from South Africa and also Portugal. Overall, a lovely, fun experience. Worth checking out!",

    "text": "Picked this restaurant for our fancy-ish London dinner based on the recommendation of Rick Steves and the many stellar reviews here, but walked away rather underwhelmed. Perhaps my first mistake was not making a reservation - for that we were banished to the downstairs dining room which was crowded and noisy. I don't generally mind small spaces but this was less 'cozy' and more 'sitting in your neighbor's lap'. I had a great front-row seat to the young lad at the next table waxing poetic on Chardonnay at top volume to impress his lady friend. The seats were covered in crumbs, which turned me off quite a bit. Seems like sitting upstairs might have been a nicer experience. The service was fine, standard British although maybe not quite so gruff. The food was just fine as well, when I was expecting something a bit... more based on the rave reviews. For our starters we got the terrine and the smoked mackerel, which were... fine. Mackerel came skin-on and bone-in, with the tail still attached, which I thought was a hilarious presentation; the terrine was just a dollop of pate with a couple of pieces of toast. For the mains we had the veal and the hake, which were, again, fine. Average-sized portions, well-cooked, although the hake was bony as hell. My bad for not knowing more about the fish, I guess. The prices were quite steep - for two starters, two mains and two glasses of wine our total was \u00a370, which I'd be happy to pay for great food, which this just wasn't. Nothing wrong with any of it but I was hoping to be blown away and the entire experience was nothing to write home about.",

    "text": "A little gem hidden in plain sight in the middle of Soho, and one of those places I must have walked past a hundred times but never looked at directly. Not until the other night anyway, when a generous friend took me whisky-and-cheese-tasting nearby and we emerged looking for sustenance. After abandoning Mildred's having been told it was a 40 minute wait, we were wandering down the street when, just by chance, an old town-house with no name above the door, but plenty of people inside, caught my eye. As I moved closer to peer through the window at the candlelit tables, a couple of women were just leaving, one of whom said, 'Thinking of going here? Do. Definitely. It's amazing.' Thank you random lady, you were so right.We went in uncertainly, given we had no idea what the food was nor what the place was even called, but the pretty setting (flowers, candles in wine bottles, white tablecloths, done) and busy tables looked promising. We were ushered downstairs to the little basement dining room and warmly greeted like old friends by the sole casually-dressed waiter there. He seemed to be doing everything for all of the tables - taking orders, bringing food, clearing empties, the lot - whilst still somehow making time to chat and give recommendations. We got chatting to him later to find out more about the restaurant - only to find far from being new it's been there over 25 years. Observation skills fail.The setting is warm and intimate, with something that felt reminiscent of Paris for me - probably how close together the tables were! But with everyone happily chatting away amongst themselves it feels quite normal. Its endearingly quirky qualities continued with handwritten menus, as these change frequently so as to use the best ingredients. My friend is veggie and to be frank I wanted to share some of his food too so our choices were made for us - we ordered the 3 veg starters, of which the stand-out was a wonderfully creamy burratini, and the 1 veg main (a pasta dish) all to share. It was the kind of food that's comforting without being too heavy, and after some encouragement from the super-waiter the chocolate brownie dessert to share went down a treat.I think we were both enjoying the atmosphere so much that we pushed the boat out on the booze front too - they have a great wine list and after a relaxed bottle of red finished far too easily (particularly after the whisky tasters earlier that night!) we had a glass of muscat dessert wine each too. While it was nice to go with a close friend (and the most enjoyable meal I'd had in a while) I think we both agreed that we'd each like to take our significant others too. I think the atmosphere really is unlike anywhere else I've been in central London, managing to ooze romance and authenticity without even appearing to try, and keeping something of a bygone era about it without being stuffy. Whether you take your current lover, a potential lover or an illicit lover this is one worth saving for someone special ;)",

    "text": "Booked here for dinner on my first night back in London. I'm visiting after living here for three months last fall, so I wanted this meal to be special. I'm picky, too--wary of Soho's trendy places that aren't worth the price. That said, I looked way in advance at many, many restaurants in Soho before choosing Andrew Edmunds. I picked it because it looked like something very different--in the best way possible--from the other popular places. It's truly a hidden gem, like reviewers before me have said. Warm, cozy ambiance and delicious food that is expertly, yet humbly prepared. It was everything I hoped it would be--and more. I was truly impressed by how good the food is relative to how reasonably priced the menu is. Wine list seems very honestly priced as well, with quite a few bottles in the 18-30 pound range.Bottom line: book here if you're looking for comforting food, traditional hospitality, and an ambiance you can either call cozy or romantic--whatever what you would like it to be ;)",

    "text": "I went to this place for two reasons: one that I had passed by outside a few times and thought it had a nice ambience. Two: the reviews here from other patrons.But I was thoroughly underwhelmed. The ambience was good, but the food lacked punch. The menu's scribbled in pencil were difficult to read. We ordered Asparagus, Walnut Salad, Duck and Cod. While the walnuts in the salad were fresh and roasted, the salad was a little dry, the asparagus lacked flavour, the cod was tasteless and the duck was not much to write home about. I was disappointed not to have given the place a better review. Alas, I can't bring myself to compliment much.",

    "text": "If I was ever going to be the owner of a small restaurant, this is the type of place I would want. Just a simple restaurant with a dozen or so tables, uncomplicated, unrushed, unpretentious, excellent. I won't dwell on the menu, as it changes every day or week, which I love. I wish I could say I loved everything I had, but I didn't. My starter sounded delicious but was underwhelming and the flavors did not blend well together. The beef main course I had, however, was delicious and tender. We wanted dessert but were too full. This the restaurant for people who aren't fooled by the lights and fanfare of the more expensive London restaurants. If this was any other place, it would have moved and expanded, but the allure would be lost. Make a reservation, with so few tables, it is hard to get in for primetime.",
