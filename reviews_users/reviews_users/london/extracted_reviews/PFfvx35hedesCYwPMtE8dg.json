    "text": "When charged with finding a place for a fancy work dinner with a foreign colleague, I was looking for the epitome of London. Near to my office but with something a bit special, I chose Skylon Bar and Grill for the views over the river. Getting a reservation was easy ( don't believe their website - call!) and I was pleasantly surprised by the whole experience. In the first floor of the Royal Festival Hall, the location is great and has the added bonus of a walk on the South Bank and a creative vibein the area. We has a 3 course meal, mine was pan-fried asparagus with poached egg starter, beatifully baked salmon with risotto for main and the most amazing white chocolate egg shell filled withrasberry and rhubarb compote for dessert. The wine list was fairly extensive and we tried a champagne from the impressive trolley. I particularly love the atmosphere - double height ceilings let loads of light in, tables are covered with all-white linens and simple settings. The best thing is that it's not too noisy - call me old! - but I also like that you can have a drink at the central bar, and then choose either the lower priced grill or the higher-end restaurant for dinner. In the right weather conditions the views of the sky are amazing, and well worth the \u00a340.00 menus. Good for a date you want to impress, good for theatre buffs, good for work dinners, good for a drink. Did I forget anything?",

At this time you get a set (two or three course) menu, which works out much cheaper than if you were to dine in the evening. As a result the choice is slightly limited but there is certainly still something for everyone and I haven't seen the same dishes offered twice. Inside it's beautiful and compliments the view brilliantly, while managing to not be too stuffy and formal. I found the service to be very efficient, maybe a little too efficient \u00a0sometimes its nice to be left alone for a while. This is by far my favourite restaurant in London, the food is varied and just amazing. I've never left disappointed or hungry. The only problem with Skylon is trying not to spend too much money on the good range of wine the (always great) sommelier will offer you. EDIT: Been another few times recently = STILL AWESOME!",

I didn't notice the brasserie area that people here have mentioned, but we ate in the gourmet restaurant, which was absolutely lovely. I can't really flaw anything. The food (I had a salmon and potato thing for starters and the duck for mains and I was too full for dessert!) was delicious and the service was really great and just how I like it to be in a restaurant of this ilk - attentive but not hovery and also not at all snooty, but warm and welcoming. The place itself is a really wonderful use of this space in Royal Festival Hall. The lighting is ambient and the decour is 60's-esque with some really unique touches. I really want one of those oil burners that were on every table! There was no loud music detectable and the place certainly didn't need it. The din of people enjoying a good meal in a really good restaurant in a beautiful surrounding was a nice enough noise to accompany a special evening. I would definitely go here again and would recommend it for a special dinner. It is on the expensive side, but I felt that it satisfied enough on many levels in order to warrant the prices.",

    "text": "Warning. I maybe a bit biased here as the first dinner that i had in Skylon was a part of one of the better evenings i have had in London in-spite of being alone.Skylon has one of the finest locations among restaurants that i have visited in London. Its in the Southbank centre and offers a stunning view of the Thames and of the Somerset House across the river. I was in the Royal Festival hall for a London Philharmonic Orchestra concert ... and i liked their a-la-carte steak menu and so i went in. It was almost closing time and so they only had the post-theatre menu on offer. Really !!! Can't i get the entrecote ??? ... i pleaded with the waitress. She was sweet enough to recheck with the kitchen staff, who curtly repeated the negative message. So i ended up with the \u00a319 post-theatre 2 course menu (\u00a322 for 3 courses), while sitting alone at a window-side table.I ordered the foie gras chicken liver parfait with toast for starter. It was possibly because i was having foie gras after quite some time, but it tasted really good ... and went very well with the glass of white wine that i had ordered. The chicken liver was perfect.For the main course i had onglet steak (what did you think ? ... i wouldn't give up on the meat, would i ?) with potatoes and spinach. What i got was a rather large portion. I went with the cook's recommendation and ordered it medium-rare, rather than the well-done that i normally prefer. Boiled spinach seemed to be a rather odd accompaniment for a steak ... but the combination was excellent and so i won't complain.My only complain against skylon is the lack of access to its a-la-carte menu. I had returned another day in afternoon, before the theatre, and i was told that at that time they were serving only the pre-theatre menu (which is identical to the post-theatre menu) and that the a-la-carte menu would be available only after the theatre starts. So between the pre and post matinee shows and the pre and post evening shows, that leaves only a precious few hours when you can have their proper dishes.I strongly recommend Skylon over all the chain restaurants nearby if you want to have a meal around the Royal Festival Hall. I will surely go back.",

Recently though I'm disappointed to see the quality go downhill fast and the prices getting increased beyond reasonable. On the positive side: - The view is premium and one of the best in London. - Tables are well-spaced. - The staff are always polite and professional On the downside: - The staff seem `too busy` all the time which means they dump the food on your table and then are off to do the next table. There's no attention to any of the diners. - The cocktails are more than 50% ice which is disappointing. - The wines are over-priced for what you get. - However, my main gripe is that for the 3-course fixed price of \u00a345 you expect the best. Unfortunately this has not been the case for the last few visits: I've found the food to be served cold, portions getting smaller, and when I quizzed why my fish was so salty I was surprised to hear \"because it lives in the sea\". I suspect more likely that the chef had an accident. Either way, I don't expect sub-standard food for that kind of price. I like to use Skylon as a `special occasion` restaurant but when you consider the quality of the food for the price they charge there are many better options in London to choose from.",

    "text": "Skylon left me feeling just a bit meh. We went for the express lunch menu (\u00a315 for 2 courses \u00a318 for 3) and while I realise this is the cheapo option, in my opinion set lunches are supposed to act as a primer for what the kitchen could really do if you gave them a decent budget. Skylon's tables are all crammed into next to one another and I know this is to maximise the return on the view that they trail so heavily on their website but I would rather not have such a good view and not practically be sharing a table with my neighbours. Also Skylon exemplifies one of my pet hates which is making dishes sound like a complete plate of food when they're not. Take for example my main which read, onglet steak, baby new potatoes, spinach. Now I read something like that and think that I don't need to get sides because everything I would want is already on the plate. In actual fact what they've done is use the things that aren't steak as garnishes e.g. 3 slices of one tiny potato dotted artfully around the plate and the smallest dollop of spinach you can get away with. This kind of thing really annoys me and I would rather they just said steak on the menu because that's a much more truthful descriptor. Service was also fairly bad, desperately struggling to make eye contact with servers is never a good thing. Actually in this price point there are quite a few places I would rather go (both Lauceston Place and Clos Maggiore do set lunches for around \u00a320) that are far far better. I won't be wasting my time or money at Skylon again.",

    "text": "All Pictures at The London Foodie(thelondonfoodie.co.uk/20\u2026 ) Going to the Southbank brings back memories of my college days in London in the early 90's - I had no money, and like many other university students, I scraped a living working in bars, shops or doing odd jobs. The Royal Festival Hall became a regular haunt then because of its free Jazz on Fridays and other events, and also for its well priced pints and good cafeteria food. Built in 1951 as an exhibition and music venue for post-war Britain, the Royal Festival Hall has been a focal point for music and cultural events in London ever since. Following a \u00a391m refurbishment of the hall and surrounding area between 2005-07, the area has now been transformed and the Hall's 1950 features sympathetically restored. The D & D London group of restaurants, of Quaglino's and Bluebird fame, joined forces in this project to create Skylon, a single space that incorporates a stunning raised cocktail bar, a fine dining restaurant and an all-day grill. The menu is modern European with a strong British influence. As part of the Brazil Festival at the Southbank this summer, Jose Barattino (the award-winning head chef of Hotel Emiliano in S\u00e3o Paulo) was invited to Skylon to introduce his modern interpretation of some of Brazil's best loved dishes, and so I went there to meet him. My student days are long behind me and now cocktails at Skylon is one of my favourite London things to do - the raised bar gives you a great view of the surrounding restaurant and the Southbank and Thames below; it is the perfect place to soak up the elegant atmosphere of the place and for people-watching. I was pleased to see a selection of Brazilian-inspired cocktails devised by Skylon's mixologists, and Barattino's accompanying bar food on the menu. For cocktails, I went for \"Delicia\" which was made from Leblon cachaca (Brazilian sugar cane spirit), Chartreuse liquor and muddled fresh strawberries and lemon. Dr G opted for \"Terra Samba\", served in a snifter glass, it was also made from cachaca, passoa liquor, passion fruit and fresh lime. Both drinks were priced @ \u00a310.50 and were exceptionally well executed with some vibrant flavours. Rather like in Spain or Portugal, in Brazil alcohol is never drunk without food. The bar food at Skylon was an excellent representation of what is served in Brazil and included \"Pastel de Bacalhau\" (deep fried salt-cod dumplings), \"Pao de Queijo com Pernil\" (cheese bread with pulled pork), \"Coxinha de Frango com Catupiry\" (deep fried potato dumplings with shredded chicken and cream cheese), and \"Torresmo\" (Brazilian style crispy pork belly). These dishes are ubiquitous in Brazil and found from the simplest (\"boteco\" bars) to the most expensive eateries in the country. It was interesting to see Barattino's take on such popular dishes, and appreciate these very familiar and delicious flavours in London. On my visit during the first week of the Festival and whilst Barattino was resident at Skylon, only the fine dining menu was available to the public at \u00a340 and \u00a345 for two or three courses respectively. Surprisingly, the options were in my opinion less interesting than the ones from the Skylon Grill menu which were priced at \u00a320 and \u00a325 for two or three courses and only available a week later. To view Skylon Grill's menu, click here. Dr G and I shared the two available options which were \"Legumes Assados com Emulsao de Castanha do Brasil\" (roasted vegetables with Brazil nut sauce) and \"Cordeiro Assado com Especiarias Brasileiras, Quirera de Milho e Mel Nativo\" (roasted lamb with Brazilian spices, corn meal and native honey). Both dishes were beautifully presented and delicious with very distinctive flavours. I loved the corn meal which I ate many times in Brazil as a child (mingau de fuba). It is similar to soft polenta but has a strong corn flavour and coarser texture. It was a perfect accompaniment to the deliciously tender and well seasoned lamb. I found Barattino a highly talented chef - few can bring such modest ingredients into their cooking and make them taste good and feel right in a sophisticated dish like the one I had. From the bar menu, I also ordered a \"Escondidinho de Carne Seca\" (Shredded jerk beef \"hidden\" under a layer of cassava cream gratin) @ \u00a37.50. I love \"cassava or manioc\" which was brought to Brazil by Africans and the Portuguese in the 16th century and cannot recommend it enough as an alternative to potatoes. It makes for the most fantastic chips and mash. In this dish, the cassava is creamed and combines beautifully with the salty meat underneath. This is one of the dishes I make sure to eat whenever I visit Brazil. For dessert, we had a \"Torta de Banana com Sorbet de A\u00e7ai\" (warm banana torte with \"A\u00e7ai\" sorbet). I love any desserts with bananas in it, but the real surprise for me was the A\u00e7ai sorbet. A\u00e7ai is a berry from the A\u00e7ai palm tree which grows abundantly in the Brazilian",

AMAZING! I got to see the London Eye, Thames, Tower Bridge and then we were at the restaurant. So about the restaurant.. you have a great view of all the above right outside the window. \u00a0It was a little hot inside the place but I guess London isn't big on AC. \u00a0Food was tasty... My friend got this truffle, broccoli and pasta thing I would highly recommend. \u00a0Looking for an after dinner place... there is a bar outside on the bottom floor.",

Have knocked back a couple of swanky (and pricey - \u00a312- \u00a315 a pop) cocktails there over the years, I've always been gagging to eat there one day. And, thanks to a cheapo set menu offer courtesy of the Evening Standard (\u00a315 for 2 courses, \u00a320 for 3, incl. glass of wine), last night I did! Myself and five buddies ate early before heading to the National Theatre, but despite the early hour the restaurant already had a good vibe, and service was polite and efficient (question though: why are ALL the servers brunettes?!). The selection wasn't massive with the set menu - only 3 choices per course - but my pumpkin soup was creamy and delicious (and, best of all, PIPING HOT, which is a must for me when it comes to soup. And to my my mum and dad, who will be reading this and will no doubt remind me that my carrot and coriander soup that I served up on Christmas day wasn't hot enough, so YES I'M A HYPOCRITE). My main was duck leg with parmesan polenta and curly cale, which was also Tasty McTasty. I must admit, however, that I always thought I'd easily give five stars to Skylon, but I think I'd have to go back there when I'm willing to spend more money to get the full, extravagant experience.",

In my reservation I asked for a view as it was our anniversary and they gave us the best view of the Thames in the house - how sweet! I also said that we would be making part payment with a 35 pounds toptable voucher which was welcomed. Service was excellent - with a fantastic bottle of wine and exemplary value for the 3 course meal. The soup was delicious to start and the roast chicken was superbly tender. I wouldn't crow home about the \"chocolate tart\" for the desert which didn't really have much chocolate but was touched by the \"wheel\" of little sweets with a \"Happy Anniversary\" tag on top of it and a candle. Amex via Tripadvisor also giving 10 pounds off. Couldn't ask for better value really!!",

Get there at the right time on the weekend and you can just watch the river and enjoy the view of London's skyline from Skylon. However, for a Coeliac it poses problems. Having bar snacks with cocktails is tricky as the staff are unaware of what the coating is or whether it contains gluten. Their light snack bar menu has limited options although the meat platter is pretty safe if not a bit - well on the meaty side. Lunch and dinner is also challenging. And gluten free diets for Coeliacs aside if you're not a fan of minimalist food - jog on somewhere else. Why have we reviewed it at all? The atmosphere is unlike any other bar in London and the decor is amazing right down to the staff's space age uniform. You wish that you'd dressed up to lounge around sipping Martinis. Must see: the view Must try: the amazing cocktails Who to take: a date you want to impress Wish: they did more gluten free options.",

The food and service were impeccable. Serving size reflects nouveau cuisine styling the taste leaves you wanting more.

I've been to the Skylon Bar & Grill twice in the last month and both times was very impressed by the service and the food. Both times we hadn't booked but they were able to give us a table straight away (with a bit of negotiation the second time as we assured them we needed to be out before 7.30 to see a show). The waiters were attentive without being invasive and the food was lovely. It certainly compares more favourably to the food at the OXO Tower Brasserie which I've also reviewed. The last time (this Saturday) we asked the waiter if we would have time for dessert before leaving for our show he gave us the truthful answer of no and then brought us a couple of sweet nibbles with the bill, which was a nice touch. I love the uniforms that the staff have to wear. Very Space Age and the decor is very modern and stylish. It would be a good place to take a date. The cocktails we ordered were also very nicely done - great to look at and not sickly sweet. So I love this place and highly recommend it. I'm also intending to go back at the first opportunity I get.",

On the one hand, it's near my work and offers wine, cocktails, teas, and virgin cocktails (aka beautifully blended juice drinks) which are heavenly. On the other hand, however, the second you cross that threshold, several minions, skirted or trousered, come up to you to see whether they can help you. I'm here, I'm looking around, I am obviously either looking for a table, or a person. How big of a leap of faith can it be to offer to find me a table, perhaps? Or if I actually talk to you, and tell you I'm looking for a table for two for drinks, do give me somewhere to sit down. Pointing me to a single bar stool next to a large person that I'd be consistently bumping into, when you have two separable four-person tables going free, is not acceptable. Well. Not for me, anyway. Either you help, or you sit in your corner and try to look decorative. Got it?So Skylon earns itself a few stars for the drinks menu, loses a few for \u00a0well staff. And gains a bonus one (or half a one?) for having nice semi-addictive nibbles that come with the drinks, as well as (the massive cherry on top) for bringing glasses of water!",

    "text": "Skylon, the name stirred various types of images in my head when I first heard we were going to dine there for a colleague's maternity leave celebration. The name inspired space-like images or some kind of futuristic setting of a ship perhaps. Alas upon landing there after a bit of struggle to find the exact location. I wandered through a corridor and eventually found a very lovely dining room. Not quite the futuristic and Jetson-like setting I'd imagined but it is open and airy with great views. Our group of 12 experienced wonderful service regarding delivery and the food quality was exceptional. My lunch was delicious from the seasonal salad with roasted pumpkin seeds to the mushroom risotto with truffles. While dining the view of the Thames is quite wonderful to gaze upon. The dining room is very nice and the finishes are in good condition. Considering the hall itself was opened in 1951 the renovations of 2007 are still looking good all around. The staff is very kind and helpful and the restaurant itself reminds me of 11 Madison in New York however Skylon is more affordable. The bar, set in the center of the room looked very nice and I can only imagine they would serve a fantastic dirty martini, shaken not stirred of course. So, while the name itself had stirred wild futuristic images I was not disappointed in my dining experience at all. Sure it would have been fun based on my overactive imagination but I will certainly plan to dine here again. For me it's another posh and down-right fabulous place added to the list so bon app\u00e9tit, y'all.",

I'm guessing the portions are to try and make it look like a hip place to be, where fashionistas and celebrities would attent, eat a lettuce leaf, and say they're full, but I'm 6'2\", 182lbs, and hungry. Aside from that though, the venue is well decorated, and the staff are always polite and helpful, even if they do sometimes seem to be darting around in a bit of a day-dream.

We had a table by the window and it was lovely to watch the colours change on the Thames as the light went down. We had the pre-theatre menu which had a fair amount of choice for that type of menu. The food was a bit disappointing though. Maybe it was because of the reviews this place received when it first opened but I expected something a little more exciting. We had fishcakes as main course which were adequate but the fries my friend ordered as a side were slightly soggy. The deserts were much better. My pear and chocolate tart with Guinness ice-cream was the perfect size and very good. Given the food and despite the service (which was good - helpful but unobtrusive) and the views, I thought it was slightly overpriced for what it is.

I was at the grill; we were lucky enough to have a table for four right by the window at night, offering great views out over the Thames and the South Bank. Cocktails were nice but very expensive. Food was pricey but portions varied; all were good quality and well-presented. My endive salad was balanced and acted as a true appetiser, getting me ready for more. My pork belly was very large and succulent. One of my companions had a steak that they said was very good too. Two others had a fish dish that - while tasty - was a bit on the skimpy side.

A carefully selected table at the window afforded us splendid views over the Thames and the north bank.We were well attended by the sommelier and our waiter, with the first round of drinks swiftly arriving at our table. Nicely at ease now, we perused the menu, having decided already to eschew starters to make room for a potential dessert option.The tasting menu looked very appealing, but requires a full wallet, so we plumped for a la carte options from a menu stacked with fish dishes - I selected the Mallard option and we added a couple of carbohydrate side dishes - thick cut chips and mash. It did feel a little odd to see chips hiding on our table alongside the notably more sophisticated main dishes. All four of the main dishes were well received, although my mallard choice was definitely the most substantial in volume. The dessert choice was now a requirement, rather than a luxury!As it was a birthday, there was an extremely well decorated chocolate sauce plate for our guest of honour - a touch of class there. Glasses of champagne, a bottle of red, four mains and desserts took us slightly north of \u00a3250, so it's not cheap ears by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a price worth paying for fabulous fare, splendid service and a super setting.

    "text": "I gave this restaurant 5 stars because of its value. The food is first rate. The service is first rate. The location is outstanding. It's a fine dining experience in almost anyone's book. But the pre-theatre menu is such a bargain for the combination of quality and service and location. The a la carte menu is priced appropriately, so if you're not doing the pre-theatre price, you'll pay what you would expect. But what a gem of a restaurant for tourists looking to have a nice dinner near the south bank, or for someone trying to save a few quid on a nice dinner experience (that's me!).",

Access is also available from inside the hall.A relaxing room, not too crowded and great service.Set lunch of 2 or 3 courses, at two different price levels helps considerably, and both had attractions. Well prepared good looking food well cooked and satisfying rather than inspired.A good value 3 matching wines offer from a very knowledgeable and enthusiastic sommelier helped to make lunch an above average one.",

The food was good and relatively well-priced compared to the restaurant at Skylon (right next to the grill). Once I had ravioli with peas which was delicious and steak on a separate occasion which was also good.Service could have been better, but overall had a positive experience here given ambiance, location, and food.",

And this review is NOT about the view. Which is exceptional itself.The wine was great: Veuve Clicquot and an excellent Chassagne-Montrachet.And the food was also delicious: as my guest, my cousin put it: \"Thank you so much for such an amazing, enlightening and all round fab night. And YUMMY dinner!!!\"She's vegetarian; the menu didn't look helpful but the servers adapted and her pasta was surpassing. My scallops and duck were outstanding.And the 'amuse Bouche', a white tomato soup, was foamy and ridiculously good,And yes, it would be worth it, just for the view. And in at sense it seems that this restaurant is a notable exception to the rule that the better the location or view, the worse the food....I will be back. Often.And yes, the view is amazing...",

    "text": "Skylon is smart, and if you get a seat by the windows the view is great, but the restaurant food was good rather than excellent, and therefore overpriced. \u00a0A three course meal for two with a single glass of wine each cost us \u00a3120. \u00a0I'd like to go back to the cheaper grill or bar, just to enjoy the setting. I feel into the foolish trap of thinking that the price indicated the standard of the food, and booked a table for my birthday treat. \u00a0Unfortunately, I now appreciate that the price was inflated because of the location (near Waterloo, Southbank and theatres, on the river). \u00a0I later gathered that Skylon does pre-theatre menus and is included in London Eye + dinner packages. So it's a fancy touristy place really, rather than somewhere I'd recommend to foodies. \u00a0In that vein, as soon as we sat down, a trolley of champagnes (with a stand-up sign showing all the per glass prices) was wheeled up to us, and the waiter was ever so slightly pushy in the way he suggested we buy a glass to start our evening. \u00a0I found that tacky and unwelcome.Service wasn't what I'd expect for the price. \u00a0Lots of harassed looking staff dashed about and various people served us, in a robotic fashion. \u00a0After declining the champagne we were left 15mins before I had to ask someone for a drinks menu, and it took a while to get attention when we were ready to order. \u00a0There was also a considerable wait for food and between courses.The food was mostly nice, and beautifully presented, but nothing made me go 'wow' and the portions were teensy. \u00a0Yummy bread.I'd planned my starter from the online menu and was excited to experience it, as is sounded like an exciting mix of flavours and textures: Pan fried foie gras, smoked eel granny smith salad,poppy seed dressing, crisp potato galett. Alas, apart from when I got a teeny bit of the tiny portion of apple, all I could taste was fatty foie gras, bland at that. \u00a0More apple, better seasoning, and citrus in the dressing would have rescued it. \u00a0The galet was laughable and hardly worth including - a 50p sized, thin, pretentious skeleton of a ready salted crisp.The boy's rabbit and chutney was pleasant , but \u00a0you could get triple the amount for half the price in a good pub. \u00a0He had tasty but tedious pork cooked three ways with cabbage. \u00a0Pork and cabbage work well, so yes, it tasted as nice as expected. \u00a0No twist.I would have liked to have seen more Scandi influences from the chef on the menu. The most Scandi thing on the online menu was a fascinating sounding salmon dish with \u00a0lemon verbena jelly, pickled cucumber, egg butter and sweet rye, but alas it was not on the night that we visited.The star of the evening was my aubergine slow-cooked in red wine, served with delicate blobs of mushroom jus, toasted almonds and a thin caviar-filled filo cigarette balanced across the top. \u00a0It was a rich and deeply savoury vegetarian dish, and it saved the night for me. \u00a0The dessert menu almost sent me to sleep, and sure enough, despite the fact that it was only 3 weeks ago, I have already forgotten what I had. \u00a0I recall cutting through a hard shortbread biscuit with my spoon. \u00a0The boy had something to do with chocolate, which was overpowered by a revolting lavender cream.So, as somewhere to go for a very expensive meal- only worthwhile if you are not paying/not too worried about such things, and not a foodie. \u00a0As a classy, dimly lit venue with high ceilings, in which you can sip a drink and admire the gleaming cutlery and sparkling River Thames, sure.",

After a sweaty couple of hours in the Royal Festival Hall following my graduation, we all trundled up to Skylon for a cool, refreshing cocktail as well as a chance to sit with some relative peace and quiet. Skylon passed on all accounts and although we didn't dine the cocktail list was divine, very imaginative and the service was attentive. I really want to go back when it is a little darker though, as the views across the river are spectacular and there is also more on that list that I want to try. I recommend the Mexican Love if you like watermelon.",

A bit hard to find, but when you do, you'll be so glad you did. Went the 1st time just for drinks before theater, and what great drinks they were. Excellent barmen, excellent drinks. And a app or two makes an excellent evening. Overlooking the dining area from the bar, we could enjoy the river traffic along the Thames and watch the lights come on as the shadows lenghtened. BlissWhich is why we're back the next night, this time for dinner. It's later amd the place is packed to the rafters. The noise level is a bit much, but everyone looks to be enjoying themselves, so we sit at the bar and wait for a table. Did I mention how good the drinks are here? In the center of the bar is a stack of alcohols on offer and part of me wants to start with a drink made from the lowest tier and work my way up...to full on drunker than a skunk I'm sure. Temptered in my desire, I limit myself to the best vodka martini I've had in London in quite some time. Dinner is great, the food on offer excellent, and delicious and well presented. What a treat!

Ok it was helped by the most dreamy sunset happening outside at the same time, bathing everything and everyone inside in a flattering golden glow and slowly turning the sky pink. A backdrop to make any bar look beautiful!Skylon is swish and pretty already though; we didn't stay for dinner as it's quite spendy and we'd decided to do the drinks splurge/eat cheap combo. We had an excuse to celebrate so the girls had ordered bubbles by the time I arrived, which got no complaints from me! Our doting waiter poured it out quite quickly, and the hazy evening sunshine and comfy sofa seating soon had us order a second bottle (cue giddy heads on the stairs back down!).Note the entrance can be tricky to spot - an unmarked staircase on the side of Royal Festival Hall. You can't book for drinks so I wouldn't take too large a group - the five of us were fine arriving about 6.30ish. It's a classy spot to impress a date too - those views of the sunlight on the river are enough to win anyone over :)",

The location is great and had really good views, especially as we had out of town guests. We went for the 2 course brunch for \u00a320 plus unlimited brunch cocktails for \u00a317. This is great value, you can switch between Bloody Mary, mimosas and prosecco and they were really good at making sure you always had a drink so you get your monies worth! The food is good, I had avocado toast and poached eggs which was well cooked. There is a mixture of breakfast type food as well as lunch items such as burgers and fish dishes. I then had the coconut and passion fruit panacotta which was nice, but very large! The downside was the service, it was incredibly slow. It was over 45 minutes before our order was even taken which was fine as we were not in a rush but then at the end they asked us to leave the second we finished as they needed the table...perhaps serve people faster then we wouldn't need to be told to leave! The waiters also tried to take plates away when people were still obviously eating (mid mouthful!) and ignored requests such as well cooked eggs from my friend who is pregnant. I think if they sort the service out this place will be a lot better , especially seeing as they automatically add 12.5% on to your bill! 3.5 stars.",

    "text": "Where do you take your oldest friend to celebrate their 60th birthday and their retirement? I needed to find somewhere iconic, somewhere special and I got it just right with the Skylon Grill. I e-mailed to ask for a table by the window so we could watch the Thames go by so I was initially disappointed to be sat mid-restaurant. However, 10 minutes later we were moved when a table became available. We then relaxed and enjoyed a delicious 3 course lunch from the \u00a325 per head set menu. I thought that this offered good value and couldn't see why anyone would be tempted by the a la carte.We drank tap water served with a flourish and a carafe of chilled Sauvignon. The beetroot and goats cheese starter was a knockout, elevating beetroot to a whole new level. The broccoli, Parmesan and almond pie was a similarly new take on familiar ingredients. Desserts were sweet and the little plate of macaroons and truffles finished off our lunch perfectly. Not forgetting the 'happy birthday' extra.Lunch lasted well into the afternoon and we joined the flow of tourists and workers strolling along the South Bank feeling at peace with the world....and in need of a nap!",

    "text": "I've worked in Waterloo for 2 years now, I go to the Southbank Centre all the time. But I've never been to this restaurant, I always seemed to forget it when I was planning special occasions. Sometimes you just want to see a part of London that isn't right next to work!But this time it was a old friend's retirement meal and I saw an opportunity. So I booked in here at the grill - there are the 2 sides to the restaurant and frankly the other side looked incredibly overpriced.Reservation no problems, got there early and got coats checked in (I enjoy the poker chip as the token). So of course what were we to do with half an hour before our reservation? To the bar! We were seated quickly, the waitress was friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed but still a bit upmarket. Always nice.So we were seated at our table, with a view over the Southbank across the Thames - personally I don't think you can bit a view like that on a sunny evening in London. One of our party was gluten intolerant and straightaway the waiter was pointing out the issues on the menu and served 3 different varieties of gluten free bread to start (I was forced to put in that there were 3 varieties, she was that impressed!). Menu had a nice variety of choice, with mains between \u00a312 and \u00a325. I had duck terrine and chutney to start, really tasty and good flavour. Then followed tuna steak cooked pink for main with lemon butter sauce and steamed broccoli - really fresh and well cooked, I was more than happy!Now normally I would be all over the dessert menu, and the sound of Bailey's cr\u00e8me brulee was pretty damn tempting. But I refrained (must be on a health kick!) and was satisfied with \u00a340 per person for 2 courses, a bottle and a half of wine each and a pretty amazing view over the Thames. Win!",

The oversized bed of (what at least tasted like) tinned creamed spinach was definitely not ideal and made worse by the fact that the hake dish had no sauce or jus? so was pretty bland and dry.
