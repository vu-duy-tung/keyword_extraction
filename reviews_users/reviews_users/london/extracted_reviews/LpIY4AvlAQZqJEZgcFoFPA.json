I didn't enjoy *eating* there though. I wasn't impressed by the food / menu. It's a bit all over the place - it had Thai, burgers, seafood, sandwiches, salads... I was confused because not only it wasn't specialised in anything specific (which is, fine, also), but it would help if the menu would be broken down by the categories if the restaurant is serving 'a little bit of everything'.All three of us have ordered a steak sandwich with onion & gravy. And it was alright. The bottom part of the sandwich got soggy and there wasn't enough meat for the price.",

The interior is quite darling with plushy couches and high top tables, perfect to cater to every mood on a Friday night. I cannot speak for the cocktails as we stuck with beers and wines, but I would return to avoid the 11:30 last calls and for the lovely ambiance.",

Second, the quality does not match the expense. The ingredients aren't great, the pours are low, and the result is a mediocre weak drink. Third, they take themselves way too seriously. They spend 10 minutes creating and messing with your cocktail for nothing. The result is an overly fluffy, bizarre drink.Fourth, the bar tenders are not friendly, nor do they like questions.I tried to opt for a classic - just a margarita on the rocks, but the lime juice was beyond acidic, the drink had no flavor, and it was weak.The vibe is nice and there is a lot of seating in the bar area with comfortable couches. But there isn't much incentive to go to this place.",

I'll admit in some cases I've tasted better but the theatre of it all is so fun that you don't mind. My friends and I were all afraid of wasting a choice on the same drink as someone else so it was all very strategic mass tasting session.I would highly recommend this place as a starter venue or as a date night. The fun that goes into the drinks is contagious!! (not literally! Or detrimentally) It's not specifically set up for large groups though, so come down en masse with caution. Things get a special mention as they thoroughly impressed me are the white Cosmo and the black toilets!Totally worth a visit!",

You receive two beakers, one with a yellow liquid and one with a blue liquid, then you mix them together for a color changing surprise! There's also dry ice, which enhances the presence. Another fun drink to order is the bubble bath. It's a sweeter cocktail with lots of fun bubbles, drink up before your bath overflows!

Although the filo pastry halloumi starter and filo prawns starter were both tasty. The drinks are far more spectacular.Had a bad experience here a month or so ago with a very, very slow lunch - followed by my friend having to make a complaint about undercooked chicken which was dealt with badly at the time. However after an email complaint we were offered a free dinner for the four of us, which was very generous.i will probably try out other places in the area before revisiting, but would go here for drinks again.",

    "text": "If this place was in Sydney, everyone would be talking about it, but because it is in a city flooded with unique places to dine it took me a while to discover it... but boy am I glad I did! \u00a0We booked for a casual dinner with friends mainly because it was reasonably priced, close to Liverpool Street station (a convenient location for the coming from work), and had a table available at 24 hours notice! \u00a0Immediately as we entered, we were taken by the ambience. \u00a0The full bar was overflowing with workers enjoying after work cocktails, but not in a gross \"sticky bar\" way more in a \"real london\", classy way. \u00a0It was a little noisy but as we followed the waitress to our table, I realised that this was my type of restaurant - the dim lighting, beautiful decor and intricate styling, there was even a beautiful old B&W movie playing silently on one wall! \u00a0The booth we were given was a tight fit which was only annoying because there was no provision for taking of bags or coats, so we had to sit on our coats and shove our bags between our feet. \u00a0Just a minor thing, but worth mentioning.While we waited for our friends, my hubby and I ordered cocktails. \u00a0Given my leaning towards gin and indecision, the waiter kindly recommended the Rosebud - a delicious gin cocktail served in a tall, thin glass. \u00a0It tasted a little like an icey Tom Collins, with a kick of rosewater. \u00a0My only complaint was that there wasn't much to it, but then again for \u00a36.95, it wasn't the most expensive cocktail I've had in London. \u00a0My hubby ordered his standard, an old fashioned, but the waiter recommended that he try their \"Smokey\" Old Fashioned and it was a good recommendation. \u00a0It arrived as three components - a whisky glass with an ice sphere and the maple syrup and bitters already in it, the Woodford reserve whisky in a little science beaker... then the waiter used some sort of smoke pipe to fill the glass with smoke... as you pour the whisky over the ice it smokes even more!When our friends arrived, they ordered a bottle of wine and we decided to order some nibbles while we waited for mine. \u00a0We ordered the hummus, vegies and pitta (which was as expected), some salt & pepper fries (bit of a weird choice, but delicious) and the duck spring rolls (which were a big hit)! \u00a0For mains, I had MAJOR food envy as I definitely made the worst choice, but it's tough when you're looking at such an exhaustive menu and have no idea which style cuisine the restaurant does well. \u00a0Our friends ordered chicken and steak fajitas respectively, which arrived as platters like a mini buffet - all the ingredients looked amazing and they were huge portions! \u00a0My hubby ordered a burger and was satisfied but not elated. \u00a0My failure of an order was the scampi... the words \"deep-fried\" and \"breaded\" should have warned me off, but this was a really heavy, unsatisfying meal. \u00a0It was presented in a bento box to make it look fancy, but really it was very fried and soggy at the same time. \u00a0I blame myself really. \u00a0I was feeling boring and didn't want to order anything very adventurous. \u00a0Next time I would definitely lean towards something more exotic on the menu.I should say that this place also seems to be quite good for groups, as there was a large party enjoying a group dinner behind us in the centre of the dining room.All in all, a fantastic find. \u00a0I'll be back and will definitely try to be more adventurous with my ordering... maybe we'll even try out breakfast next time!",

The front of the bar is decorated in beautiful Christmas lights and inside there are high vaulted ceilings and various tables surrounding a bar in the middle stocked with interesting scientific apparatuses. The London Cocktail Week drink was a raspberry liqueur with grapefruit vodka, vermouth and citrus bitters. But the most amazing part is that first it was heated over an open flame, and then poured over dry ice and served to us in a beaker, that then you poured into a glass with ice. The drink itself was also very nice, tasting more of grapefruit than anything else, and it went down easy. We were standing at the bar and we saw all sorts of interesting things being put in drinks, like Cheerios and pop rocks. It is very much an after-work crowd, with many suits from the City and plenty of girls showing up for the great drinks. Would definitely come here again!",

Immediately I could see that I would happily have spent my entire evening here instead. We walked in a saw a bartender expertly making 2 exotic and scientific cocktails. I later found out that they were Caramelised Rum Punch (the caramelise brown sugar and then throw the other ingredients in giving lots of sparks and flames) and Bubblebath (the concoction literally bubbled out of the glass; it was amazing). We had a quick look at the menu and I chose a Smokey Old Fashioned (described as Woodfood Reserve, Maple Syrup, Dilution, Jerry Thomas Bitters, Smoke) and Lucy had Peaches and Cream (Briottet Peach and Pink Grapefruit, Lemon, Prosecco, Fizz). Wow. This is a fantastic bar. The theatrics of the experience really make it. We got a little peckish so ordered off the bar menu. Salt and Pepper Pork Cracklings. Very tasty and light but for the amount we got, we didn't think it was worth the price.We had a few more drinks between us before we left. A Barrel Aged Negroni (Tanqueray, Campari, Vermouth, Oak, Time), a Ballbreaker (Tanqueray, Briottet Pink Grapefruit, Lemon, Blackcurrant Ball to Break) and a Vesper Martini (Portobello Gin, Reyka, Lillet, Lemon Bitters, Dry/Delicious). The last one was particularly memorable as it was served in a hop flask which you get to keep!I would tell you how they made some of these cocktails but I wouldn't want to spoil the surprise!They also have a restaurant area at The Alchemist. It looks really nice and comfortable. I took a quick look at the menu and there's plenty there to keep us interested too!",

We only ended up here by chance after seeing all the awesome yelp reviews on here. The place has a great smart-casual atmosphere and ample space to walk around and mingle with friends. So I can see this as a cool place to bring work colleagues but also dates. Signature cocktails like The Mad hatter's tea party or the meringue and passion fruit martini was a winner in my books as it is as much fun to watch the bartenders make the drink as it is to drink it. We didn't get a chance to try the food yet, but we're definitely coming back soon.",

    "text": "Considering how inspired and flavorful the drinks are, you would think that the food would at least be in the same realm of greatness...WRONG. Instead the menu is unfocused bordering on schizophrenic, boring and tasteless. The table service was a bit awkward, I suppose they were training people, because the minute you asked them a question they looked like deer in headlights. The prices seem reasonable, but then you will see all these additional charges once you get your bill...as well a near 10% service charge. Be careful when they give you the options of your sides or sauces, because some (most) have up charges...they will just conveniently fail to mention that. I am a big believer in full disclosure on up charges if the server is giving you the options...otherwise its a bit shady. Moving on...For drinks I had the Lightbulb Moment, and the Smokey Old Fashioned. Both were amazing. The Lightbulb Moment, which is a gin based drink, and I'm a gin girl, was maybe in my top 5 favorite drinks I've ever had. The Smokey Old Fashioned is the ideal version for those new to this drink as it's an extremely smooth interpretation. Now for the food. We got the calamari to start, and I ordered the fillet steak sandwich with sauteed onions and mushrooms. The calamari was under seasoned and the batter was not quite crispy leading to an underwhelming dish. Speaking of... this so called fillet steak sandwich was one of the most flavorless and disappointing things I've eaten in a long time. It was merely chunks of chewy, overcooked beef with zero flavor, topped with mushrooms and onions that were also devoid of any flavor whatsoever...which seems like a feat in itself, on dry rye bread (the only thing you could actually taste). The gravy dipping sauce and half the shaker of salt couldn't even bring out any taste in this thing. The sandwich comes with fries...when placing my order the waitress asked me if I wanted regular fries, sweet potato fries, or salt and pepper fries. I got the salt and pepper fries. Turns out by salt and pepper they meant salt and bell peppers and onions....ok but then she charged me extra for that. Sketch. And the fries tasted like frozen ones out of a bag. All the other food I saw around did not look that great either.I can't say that this was the worst meal I've ever eaten, but I CAN say it is the worst thing I have ever eaten in England. The 2 stars are for the atmosphere and their stellar drinks. Don't waste your money eating here, but do come for the drinks at the bar downstairs.",

So we were pleasantly surprised People were dressy, but we wound up coming in jeans, sweaters, and sneakers and there were no issues. \u00a0We got a table for 2 with no wait at around 6pm on a Saturday. The cocktails are the best! So creative, \u00a0smoke, fire/caramelized ingredients. Really well put together. The place provides an allergy binder if you ask, listing all the possible allergens in each meal - gluten, \u00a0egg, nuts, \u00a0soy, etc. Not a ton of gluten allergy options, wound up with steak and salad (allergy list suggested steak or chili as the g.f. options). Of note, the fries are listed as gluten free but they're fried in same oil as other flour containing foods. But waiter brought that up himself, which I appreciate. \u00a0Also, other gluten free options might be possible \u00a0- maybe with no tortilla fajitas or no bun burger, but I didn't ask. The curry and Ramen both had gluten components.Beautiful atmosphere, \u00a0not too crowded tables. \u00a0:)",

Or maybe they're performance artists with drinking problems? Either way The Alchemist is the kind of cocktail bar that any cocktail aficionados boozy dreams are made of.We only stopped in for a few quick cocktails but the expertise by which our cocktails were concocted and the degree of difficulty they were executed were on a whole other level. I went with my go to Manhattan and Old Fashioned and far and away these were in the top I've had ever. The rest of our group went for fancier cocktails with creative names (that evade me now - apologies this review is 6 months late), but the general consensus was \"Ohhh, Ahhh, Yummm and OMG that's amazing\". So you get the gist of it.Had I had more time I would have come back to try their dinner along with a few more cocktails but alas, vacations are fleeting at times so I did the best with the time I had here!Looking forward to returning for another go later this year!",

    "text": "In the heart of London city, next to the iconic gherkin is a chic bar/restaurant Alchemist. When you walk in on a weekday evening it's buzzing with all the city workers drinking at the bar, but upstairs is a nice relaxed area for girls who want to catch up with their friends. The ambience and modern but chic with rustic elements to it with gold embellishments around. They have a black and white Charlie Chaplin film as the main background. The drinks menu goes on forever but my favourite was the caramelised rum punch with hint of pineapple and cinnamon. I don't recommend the flavour changing one as it was just pure artificial syrup at the bottom, yikes. The food was a mix of British/Mexican/Japanese/Chinese so they had some ramen choices to fish and chips so abit odd.We had a mix of starters and I recommend the bang bang chicken. I always love a bit of sweet potato chips too. The prawn on skewers with curry sauce was ok but I would definitely go for drinks rather than food. Verdict: definitely go for drinks but not the food. And for deserts, choose the usual stuff...the salted caramel cheesecake had way to much salt we had to down the bottle of water! The waiters were very nice and gave us a bill of about \u00a330 each which isn't bad considering we had a few to drink but the food is abit meh.",

This is good because it's super easy to get a booking/walk straight in but also kind of bad because a lot of tables remained empty leaving the atmosphere a bit dry.The menu was a weird mix of Japanese and pub food sooo we ordered a bunch of stuff to share. It was cheap and edible but not amazeballs. The cocktails were pretty cheap at ~\u00a37-8 each and way larger than normal. The range of different concoctions were pretty impressive too. The passion meringue cocktail was my fav and the salted caramel rum one was pretty damn good too! The flavour changing one was waaay too sweet though and it was just pure sugar at the bottom. Would go back for drinks but not food!",

Look no more.Reservation is smooth, I called and they sent me a confirmation email (since I don't have a UK phone number). Cocktail journey started with a Passion fruit meringue, because who wouldn't like merengue on top of their cocktail? Specially if it comes with a spoon for you to dig in and be happy! Next for me was the Garden Martini, with gin and flowers, unforgettable. To eat, my friend and I had a Sharing Platter and a side of fried baby calamari. The platter was really tasty, the dumplings blow my mind. I was also impressed that the nachos were made from real maiz tortilla, good job. I ordered a fudge cake so we could sing happy birthday but that ended up being a gift from The Alchemist (#adorbs, thank you). Got jealous of my friends who ordered the Tea Party - if you like tea, or simply if you want to impress someone, order that. You will be surprised. Service was impeccable, our waitress was also so nice, talkative and suggested great options. I would certainly come back here more often if I lived in London.",

I'll never pay full price for a cocktail (happy hour b@1 what whaaaat) but if you're going to make it change colour, blow smoke or pour it from a kettle into a teacup for normal London cocktail prices then hand me your menu fine sirs!Been twice; first time was Valentine's Day (twas a Saturday) and it was so lovely! All quiet and you could get served almost instantly. Went back on a Friday eve and it was a veeeeeery different story. Three deep all around the bar. Killed it quite a bit for me.So, when it's not Friday night packed, people should check this place out. p.s you can buy a cocktail in a hip flask for \u00a311 and keep the hip flask! or have it refilled for \u00a37.50. FAAAAAANCY!!",

Everything on the menu looks fantastic and is cheap too, by London standards, with drinks coming in at \u00a37-8 a piece.I had the flavor changing cocktail as well as the passion fruit cocktail with meringue that is torched on top. Both tasted good and were a ton of fun to watch make. There were all kinds of beakers, dry ice, Bunsen burners... You name it. I wanted to try it all.My only critique is that given the level of theatrics, there are a lot of premade syrups, and not a lot of fresh juices/zest. This is a different kind of cocktail bar but just thought it should be noted the cocktails don't taste like some you'd get at your neighborhood speakeasy :)",

This place is definitely not cheap, and gets really crowded with businessman types and hot ladies in tight skirts and impeccable makeup (I kept wanting to go around and ask them what brands they used, but I didn't because boundaries.)The pageantry of the cocktails is really cool, and super worth the cost. A lot of the drinks are steaming, smoking, or literally on fire. I love fancy cocktails, but have had my fill of tiny sipping glasses with some mixture of fourteen ingredients that I can't pronounce. This place went above and beyond. Also, I got the smoky old fashioned and it was maybe the best old fashioned I've ever had. And I drink a lot of old fashions and also am very judgmental.",

For dessert I orders the lemon and poppyseed fondant. It takes ~15mins to cook, but 100% worth the wait. Now for the drinks: I got the colour change and the rhubarb & custard sour. The first was a tasty apple drink. The rhubarb and custard sour was my favorite. It had a creamy texture with a touch of sweetness. I stumbled upon this cute place on my walk back from the Tower of London. I highly recommend it!",

It was crowded but we were able to grab a booth seat towards the back and get a nice view of the whole place. It's an experience to watch them make the drinks. We ordered a Smokey Old fashioned. There was a little problem with the smoke machine tube thing in the beginning. The taste was great! My friend ordered the fizzy bubblegum drink and had to quickly take couple of sips since it started spilling over the cup. My sister ordered a kale & apple smoothie with a huge kale stalk inserted, interesting. The flavors of the drinks were all good. I can't comment much on customer service since we pretty much sat ourselves, had to walk over to the bar to order, wait a while, pay then bring our drinks back to the table. So minimum interaction with the staff.Prices are comparable to what I've paid back in the U.S. I'd go back.",

They have an outdoor patio in back, which is a great place to hangout with friends after you get your drinks.The drinks are not cheap, but everything on the menu is very creative and fun to watch the bartenders mix your drinks. Everything on the menu reflects The Alchemist's theme of chemistry because each item is associated with an element symbol. Many of the cocktails are served in items found in a lab, such as a lab flask.I was very satisfied with my Mad Hatter. Served in teacups, the Mad Hatter was very sweet and it really was an alcoholic tea drink.--taste / 4aesthetics / 5vibe / 5service / 3price for quality / 2OVERALL / 3.8",

She was friendly, professional, and on top of things. We actually went back again for dinner one night, and had her again! It was great!The atmosphere here is super chill. Good music, great decor, I loved it. The projections on the wall were a great touch.For breakfast, the standout? All of it. There wasn't a thing I would change. The bacon was outstanding, the black pudding, delicious. The waffles with good syrup... Perfect perfect perfect.For our dinner night, we had some amazing drinks, and very good food as well. The steak was great. The Yorkshire Pudding was a life changer.Paige took a minute to chat with us, and found out we were heading to York, so she made some good suggestions for food there (Including the sister of the Alchemist, the Botanist.) Her suggestions were spot on...The Alchemist is a rare find. 5 Bright Stars!",

So I convinced a group of colleagues to join me for an upmarket mixologist made cocktail. And so imagine our disappointment when we walked into an establishment where the recently vacated were with half finished beverages were on the extremely sticky tables. We moved to the end of the bar and were informed that this area was closed by one of the barmen. So we moved, squeezed into a gap and waited. We ordered off their great looking menu and we received our cocktails that were definitely visually pleasing. The folks that ordered beer definitely got the best deal because all of the cocktails were mediocre tasting. My old fashioned was extremely sweet and lacked the balanced layers of flavors that are the trademark of this drink. The smoke which made it visually appealing did add some flavor but it was as if the mixologist that made it was lazy and relying on the smoke only to deliver a good drink. Summary - a visual experience with agreat menu and cocktails that lacked real flavor and served by rude and arrogant barmen",

Twice, I had to send nachos back because they were sitting in a puddle of cold water.Turned out the staff were placing freshly washed, iceberg lettuce on top of the nachos, drenching the meal on cold water. When the third plate of soggy nachos arrived, I gave up explaining the importance of putting salad into a salad spinner.The rest of our meal was, meh...but no one comes here for the food! The cocktails are my real reason for visiting. They often have fun twists such as edible bubble bath bubbles, glitter or colour changing ingredients.Drinks were slow to arrive on this visit, but staff were friendly and polite. Most Alchemist branches are in locations with lots of city workers (this one is no different), so evenings can get extremely busy.The cocktails were great though! But order from the bar, rather than the restaurant, as this is where they hide their most proficient mixologists!",

    "text": "This bar is on point. Loved the drink menu. Loved the art on the menu. The drinks were amazing and very creative using science as part of their technique. The atmosphere was very high-end and eclectic. Playing electronic music in the background. Vegan options available at the bar: olives, edamame, nuts. The restaurant portion was packed with a queue of 90+ minutes. I would have likely stayed for dinner if they had vegan options...but alas they did not. The bartender told us that it is fully packed on the weekends.",

The atmosphere is fun and upbeat, which makes for a nice dinner and some drinks before you go out for the evening. I wasn't expecting the food to be amazing, do to them focusing on their drinks, but it was EXCELLENT! Their drinks are honestly not that expensive for how well made they are and the fact that they're VERY unique. If I ever come back to London, this will be number one on my list to come back too.",

    "text": "Talk about Instagram worthy cocktails! I sincerely wish this place existed when I worked just down the street. I was recently back in London visiting some friends and found this place when I was looking for bars near Liverpool Street. I am so glad we stopped by. The space is huge for a cocktail bar. There were plenty of seats right at the bar, which is definitely where you want to be to watch the magic. I should mention it was a Sunday evening so it wasn't terribly crowded. The menu is huge. I was intrigued by the \"magic\" ingredient and ordered the Color Changing One first. As some reviewers have noted, the drink is a little on the sweet side, but it was well worth it just for the fun of getting the beakers and watching the magic happen. It smoked the entire time I was drinking it. I can't remember exactly which drink my friend ordered but it came in a flask, which she was allowed to keep. For \u00a39-12, I thought the drinks were a relative bargain. Similar places in NY would definitely set you back $16-25. We tried two more drinks before leaving and both were delicious, but the real fun was watching the bartenders work on everyone's cocktails.",
