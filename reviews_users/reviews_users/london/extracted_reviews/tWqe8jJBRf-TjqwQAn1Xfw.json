The atmosphere of the pub and the restaurant is very nice, the staff are friendly and professional and the food was fantastic. We all had the rotisserie lamb, which I would highly recommend. It came with all the trimmings, and there was lots of it. Afterwards we had the cheeseboard, which was also very nice - the chutney was amazing.The only drawback is the noise level, I didn't mind, but my older aunties found it difficult to follow the conversation, so that is something to keep in mind if your hearing isn't great.",

    "text": "I will start by saying this place is probably pushing it at 4* for me but it is a solid 3.5 so to give it 3 is a little unfair. My blood sausage with fennel and apple salad starter was nice but the tiny bit of salad didn't really balance with the aize of the sausage. Also in all honesty it could've done with some bread or toast to go with it but thats a minor gripe. A big problem for me was the grouse main, it hadn't been cleaned out properly so some of the meat was slightly tainted with a very bitter taste. The restaurant was very noisy as well, I appreciate it was Sunday lunchtime but it was so noisy I couldn't hear the waitress telling me the specials from 2 feet away and had to go and read the board at the other end of the room. The sides, dessert and service however were very good. I think I would like to go back and try another dish as I get the impression I might just have been unlucky, however at \u00a3150 for Sunday lunch for 2 you would expect that not to happen. The Jugged Hare has ambitions towards fine dining and certainly some of the prices are already Michelin level. Chateau Briand with no sides included at \u00a355 anyone? However I dont think they are quite there, it lacks the finesse of fine dining. The waitress was efficient but the folding of our napkins whenever we put them down and the topping up of water and wine felt forced here and out of place.",

Unfortunately, this happened when I stopped in for a quick dinner with my friend at Jugged Hare before we attended an event at The Brewery. Imagine then, if you will, a small bowl of ketchup creating a spectacular demonstration of anti-gravity and chaos theory, said bowl hit the ground and all ketchup within went splattering all over my friend, and a bit on to me. This could, quite easily, ruin a night. Thankfully, the servers and manager were extremely polite about it, brought me club soda to clean everything (old wives' tale that works!), and gave my friend the address where to send his dry-cleaning bill.And just think, that's all independent of the food and atmosphere!- they have a great selection of local beers, which always scores well with me- the fish that my friend had was very tasty, and we shared the bread- the atmosphere is perfect gastropub, reminiscent of a hunting hall, but still high end and City-qualityTwo great things: the basics were covered, and they reacted to crisis well.",

This is no grimy tavern lunch, this is posh pub dining from the waiters wearing waistcoats to the wine cellar. From the second we walked in the door, eyes drawn skyward to the series of dead hare heads mounted on the walls - they were on it, delivering first class service. 'Can I offer you an aperitif before you sit down? How about a Bloody Mary?' Our own waiter was very knowledgeable and charming; explaining the heritage of each dish, offering suggestions and even advising on coffee locations afterwards. The place seems inspired by traditional English heritage with dishes on the menu that are based on recipes from centuries past \u00a0but modernised. It's very polished and stylish inside, you aren't sitting in the front bar but a full restaurant with the occasional hare motif dotted around. And the food: money well spent. Pork crackling to start and superior cuts of meat for the roasts - surrounded by a big Yorkshire pud, separate plates of veggies and creamy cauliflower cheese. The meat was served a bit rare for my liking, but i imagine it would have pleased most everyone else. We finished with a generous cheeseboard. Honestly, I cannot give you one good reason why you should eat your Sunday lunch anywhere but here. I couldn't fault their service, presentation or the quality of the food. \u00a0If you have someone to impress, parents to take out or you'd just love a decadent Sunday lunch. Go here!",

Somehow we relinquished (a small) sharing portion of our own dishes around the table in the spirit of Christmas--everyone was very much pleased.Nice location in the City; worth it for a night after work with colleagues or a weekend gathering of friends.",

    "text": "I love the gastropub concept so my friend and I thought we'd knock off another one on the list of Top 50 Gastropub Awards. This pub is so conveniently located in the City, I would never have thought that it had some serious food cred as well! I booked a table for 12:15 and when we arrived, we went to the back dining room where it was completely empty. It is quite a big venue, and in the back you feel like you are dining at a quite high end restaurant, so unfortunately it has lost the authentic gastropub feel. (By way of comparison, at Bull & Last we dined on the first floor right near the bar and there were no more than 10 other tables on that floor.) The tables gradually filled up over the next hour, but it was by no means full... maybe people don't fancy roast for Saturday lunch. Anyway, I ordered the whole roast grouse and my friend ordered the jugged hare. I enjoyed the grouse but was surprised that the meat was fairly rare, and was also not a big fan of the hairy feet left on the bird. As for the hare, I had a bite and the consistency was of stewed beef casserole but the meat has a very particular taste to it... I doubt I could eat a whole plate of it, but it is interesting and worth trying. All in all, I think the restaurant provides a very different take on pub food aside from the usual fish & chips, etc., and I feel like if you do a dish like jugged hare well, that probably earns you some serious points in the dining award world. Also to note, the menu is not cheap, with most items in the 25-30 pound area, on par with a high end restaurant but definitely not anything like your average pub!",

I had a mallard, which was a special, and while it's pricey at \u00a328, you do literally get a whole bird. I was a bit disappointed with the game chips, which turned out to basically be salted crisps - I was imagining something a bit heartier. But the meat was pink and delicious. My friends were also very enthusiastic about their mutton, chicken and sausages and mash, and the various roast accompaniments (carrots, cauliflower cheese, roast potatoes, etc). The pecan and treacle tart was a tad disappointing because I'd envisaged something more like a pecan pie, but it was nice enough. Friends enjoyed all their desserts, which I think were sticky toffee pudding and apple crumble. Overall what confirmed it as a 4* spot to eat was how everybody was discussing what they would have next time, which is a good sign!The vibe inside is great and it does feel more high end than just a gastropub, which is fortunate considering the higher prices. Service started off great, with the right amount of attention, and we always had full water glasses. However, there were some long gaps (waiting to get dessert menus, waiting for the bill), which weren't a problem on a lazy Sunday afternoon but would have been irritating in different circumstances. We also had a waiter who didn't know what lime and soda was and brought us lemonade, which was a little odd in a pub, but a more senior guy remedied the situation quickly and pleasantly.",

I bought a round first which included a glass of wine. The pour was one of the most generous I have seen worldwide with him finishing off the rest of the bottle. As we had our drinks we perused the restaurant menu which screamed UK countryside to me with rabbit, pigeon and pork as just some of the delicious options. My partner and I shared the leg of a suckling pig they had. \u00a0All I can say is it was top notch! The only thing that annoyed me about this place and why it didn't get 5 stars was the assumed 12% service charge.",

So much so that after ordering four between the three of us, we were quite satisfied without mains. Delicious terrine, fantastic crab meat salad, the wild bore pie was delightful. I wish we'd had room for mains!Protip 1 - don't ask the staff for recommendations. Their finger will go right to the most expensive option available. Protip 2 - They sell these rare black gull eggs for \u00a37.50 each. Avoid. It's a raw egg, with salt, pepper and mayonnaise on the side. Tastes like any other egg, though apparently only five families in the world can harvest them. But stories and rarity don't impart flavor!",

I agree wholeheartedly with Zoe K that the 1/2 chicken was juicy and flavourful. My friends all seemed to enjoy their roast of aged meats....the side of sprouting brocoli with almond butter looked amazing. Strangely enough the special of the day was \"squirrel pie\" which sadly none of us tried. There is a long list of grilled meats and fishes, so plenty of choice or even the fussy of carnivores.The atmosphere definitely draws a wealthier well put together clientele, though the excessive taxidermy on display by the bar is rather bizarre. What's the story behind the stuffed ferret?!?",

My only problems with the meal were the carrots had horseradish on them which I was not expecting since i'm not a fan of the flavor they were however still good once dipped in the gravy or the cream sauce from the cauliflower. \u00a0The roast potatoes were lacking flavor but were again saved by the gravy and cream sauce.",

There's a small little section on the top-right hand side of the menu that tells you what type of food is in season. How nice of them, and pretty clever.From the start, I was impressed with the range of the menu and there seemed to see so many delicious options to choose from. Unfortunately, the in-season salmon was out for the day, so I opted for the Atlantic Cod instead as my main. It was light and flaky and flavourful, served on a bed of peas. My friend had the mutton bomb, which was fantastic - the meat was juicy and tender and the pastry was flaky and buttery. For sides, we had the steak chips and the turnips, all good choices.I particularly liked that they had a \"pairing\" wine lists for certain mains on their menu. Who needs a sommlier when that's done for you already?All in all, a great place.",

There was even a cooked pigs head at the place where they serve up the food, which was kinda gross, but I guess they use all parts of the animal?I ordered the pheasant on the menu of the day and we split a bottle of red for the table. The wine was nice and smooth and went well with dinner. The pheasant came out with the thigh and leg, and the foot still attached. It was a bit off putting, but the pheasant itself was nice. The gravy provided helped to moisten up the bird a bit and give more flavor. On the side were chips (crisps really) and asparagus. Overall the food was nice and the wine was lovely. The ambiance fit with the menu. The place is on the pricier side, but if you're looking for a place with an English hunting menu.. this is the place to come!",

The menu is certainly impressive, with british delicacies like wellington, meat pies, fish, steak, etc. \u00a0Some of the descriptions were incredibly detailed like this is a female dairy cow, 2 years into retirement. \u00a0Not sure that was the most appetizing description of \"flank steak\", and did turn me off of ordering the beef. \u00a0I ordered the restaurant's namesake dish - a jugged hare, which came with a side of cabbage with bacon bits, and mashed potatoes. \u00a0The hare is actually served in a JUG, like the kind you would pour lemonade from on a hot, humid summer day. \u00a0 I also ordered a side of bone marrow sauce - which happened to be the saving grace of my meal. \u00a0The hare was incredibly dry and tasted almost like a pulled chicken, the meat was completely shredded and mixed in with a very watery sauce. \u00a0Mash was typical mash, and the cabbage needed some more time on the stove, crunchy in a toothsome way. \u00a0The food overall was pretty bland and boring, in desperate need of salt and pepper to impart any flavor.",

Had an incredible meal - some burgers, some mussels and at the end a bunch of sticky toffee puddings.Chilled tomato soup was not a winner, but the poached whole artichoke was absolutely amazing. Had the potted Hampshire Trout which was also delicious. Also tried the haggis scotch egg and crispy pigs ears which were exactly as expected. So yummy.Amazing service, great hand-pulled ale selection and a perfect London-y ambience.Could've come back here 10 times during our visit. So good.",

Atmosphere is on point - I felt like I had entered a menagerie of fowl and small and medium game, but not circus like and v respectful of the offerings. Service was good despite a busy night and well worth the cost. Can't wait to return to try more and more!",

    "text": "Probably one of the best Sunday roasts in London. A true gamer's paradise, this gastropub is decorated as traditional brasserie-meets hunter's trophy room. Taxidermy sidles up next to brass finishings and elegant dining areas. I love the expansive paintings depicting the thrill of the hunt - complete with hounds, hares, horses, fanfare and jodhpur-clad round-bellied men. If you're up for dining in this environment, it's only the icing on the cake.The food is WONDERFUL. Duck fat chips, Yorkshire puddings, roast mutton, quail, hare, roast beef, wild boar -- any and every cut of meat, dripping in fat, oven-roasted for hours. We had the Sunday rump roast and liver terrine. The wine selection by the glass was perfectly complementary and the place wasn't too crowded. In all, an excellent selection of fine fare, good drinks and English ambiance.",

    "text": "Celebrating my first English meal in London at The Jugged Hare felt right. The gastropub is clean with ample wooden decor (also taxidermy everywhere!). Our party sat at one of the barrels and enjoyed the sunlight coming in through the atrium. Great ambiance to spend Sunday afternoon catching up with friends.Beers on tap are cask ale, bitburger, heineken, etc. I've never tried/heard of cask ale before, but my party introduced it as uncarbonated, warm beer. Sounds interesting enough to try it one of these days. My Sunday Roast with beef was really a feast. Although you can get it with chicken or lamb, the beef is aged for 45 days. The horseradish was on the creamier side without enough kick so that I felt the beef to be overwhelmed. However, the steamed vegetables were seasoned well and contrasted well to the cauliflower cheese gratin.",

All the staff that work there are very friendly and cheerful. \u00a0I sat along the back of the wall so I was able to see the kitchen / pass from where I was sat, loved it. \u00a0I enjoyed watching the head chef at the pass especially. \u00a0The restaurant serves various food from your traditional homemade pie to Lobster. \u00a0For starters me and my husband both had scallops with black pudding, for mains I had cod on a herb risotto, my husband steak with chunky chips (I don't like chips but my The Jugged Hares was amazing and so crispy and hot) and for dessert I had Lemon tart and my husband apricot and apple crumble. Portions was a good size, everything was steaming hot and all the food tasted lovely. I would go back and eat there if I am in the area. \u00a0 The toilet area is downstairs and I must admit I was surprised by its niceness and how clean the bathroom area was, very well kept. \u00a0Love the waterfall taps and the towels that are piled up on the table. \u00a0Only one piece of advice I feel is that for pub food the meals are a bit on the expensive side and this is why I only give my review 4 stars but that is not a criticism as I would go back.",

The food is seasonal specialising in game along with spit roast meats as well as fish. I have personally tried the namesake dish and it's lovely, hare which is cooked in its own blood. They do an awesome Sunday roast also. There is also a lovely outside seating area across the road where in the summer you can relax in comfortable seating and simply watch the city pass by. The Jugged Hare should definitely be on your list to try.",

This bodes well for the meaty game theme.I'd read good things about the Sunday roast, so was keen to give this a go. \u00a0Between 6 of us we had the 45 day aged rump roasts, bacon croquettes, boar bombs, rabbits liver on toast, scallops, and a rump steak. \u00a0The liver and scallops were from the specials menu. \u00a0Each dish was a well prepared, good sized portion. \u00a0I get really excited when a restaurant serves cauliflower cheese with their Sunday roasts, and the Jugged Hare serves up a delicious side with theirs.Service was really friendly and accommodating. \u00a0The waitress arranged for a kids portion of fish and chips for the one child we had in the group. It turned out to be a lovely grilled piece of cod, triple cooked chips, and a side of veg. \u00a0On the way out we were shown the ageing cabinet where meat is hung, which was gross and pretty great all at the same time.All in all a pretty great afternoon of eating. \u00a0We will definitely be back for more!",

They specialize in game, but if you're not that adventurous, they do have some normal items.We started with some queen scallops with chorizo and garlic. Hmmmmm so delicious and creamy. We also had a salad, but in the face of all these yummy game meats, I could barely remember what it was.I had the roe deer and port sausage with mashed potatoes, which was a game version of bangers and mash, essentially. The mash and the roast onion was very, very savory, and you could definitely taste a hint of herb in there. The roe deer sausage was interesting but a bit grainy, so it wasn't as good as I had hoped. On the other hand, you could tell it was a freshly made sausage.I really wish I had tried the jugged hare since I never had that dish. I read about it online and got cold feet... (poor rabbit). If you're a traveller craving for British pub food with a flair, this is a good place to go!",

This was an upscale but neighborhood feeling bar with a lively but not to crowded atmosphere on Thursday night (probably more crowded at the end of dry Jan). Great selection of beer on tap, wine (pricy) and good gin behind the bar. Their jugged hair ale was tasty as well as the ipa on tap. Also had an expertly made gin and tonic with ginger instead of lime made with opirh gin. My one complaint is that they automatically poured double which made the drink pricy. Would have loved to try the wild boar scotch egg but the kitchen was closed. Also had olives behind the bar. The eating menu looked game centric but also expensive. Would come back to eat. What's best is that this place is on my walk home from the city. For good drinks and nibbles, this is a gem.",
