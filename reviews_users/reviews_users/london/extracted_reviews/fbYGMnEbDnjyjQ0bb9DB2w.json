    "text": "Never in the history of Dim Sum have such small parcels of food been so expensive to eat for so many.I made the mistake of going here with the family on a Friday evening with no reservation.They found us a table quickly to their credit as the place was rammed. The service, despite the pace of the place was commendable. Fast, friendly with no fuss. My biggest complaint was the food: way too expensive for what it was. As a steamed dumpling fiend, the chicken Shu Mai hit the stomach in the right place and in truth, there's something here for all tastes. Thing is, though there's lot of different things to eat, there isn't a lot to eat.Call me old school but i like to have a lot of Dim Sum on a few plates, rather than half a dozen platters holding three so-so parcels each. You'll eat but you won't be getting satisfied any time this side of the Rapture. Ping Pong's all a bit too sanitised and lacks surprise. As for the drinks make sure you actually receive liquid rather than a tumbler full of ice. Considering that there was no alcohol involved, the best part of one hundred pounds for a meal, after which i felt hungry again wasn't a good advert for the popular chain.The saving grace i guess was the location, on London's perennially busy South Bank but you can't eat a view can you?",

That's london!",

This restaurant is beautiful and the drinks are fantastic which brought my rating from a 2 to a 3 star. The service I received at the restaurant was ok, and the food was adequate. \u00a0In the past year they have changed their menu, and to be honest their old menu was better. \u00a0Our food arrived quickly and it all tasted good, their dessert menu isn't fantastic, so you might have to follow on somewhere else afterwards :) It is quite expensive considering you may not leave full. In my opinion there are much better Dim Sum places in China town.",

Don't ask me why -- I've seen it around town and always meant to go, but for some reason I was never able to get around to it until yesterday. I'll set the scene. Its a frightfully Grey and painfully cold Monday. My Monday morning blues are immense and the vibe at my office is bleak, so my colleague and I decide to head out for some comfort food on our lunch hour. We headed for Southbank and the genius revelation to make this the day that I visit Ping Pong for the first time came about. Upon entering we were greeted by a lovely hostess who took us to our table and informed us of their lunch offer. \u00a38 for an 8-item set meal plus a signature tea drink. Amazing and yes please! We placed our orders and I could feel the Monday blues leaving my system immediately. 10 minutes later we were surrounded by a plethora of food. For a mere \u00a38 we each got.....4 steaming hot sticky chicken and prawn dim sum balls, sauteed mushrooms, steamed broccoli, hot and spicy chicken won ton soup, a steaming bowl of honeyed chicken breast and rice and a bottomless flowering green tea. By the end I literally felt like a Dim Sum. I was stuffed to the brim, happy as a clam and....ready for a nap. Sadly, we had to head back to the office, but my \u00a38 delight definitely kept the spirits up all day. Our waiter was so lovely as well. He was extremely helpful and attentive and made our meal that much more enjoyable. Thanks Ping Pong! I'll most certainly be back...but I may have to skip breakfast next time around!",

    "text": "Best dim sum I've ever had? No, probably not. Fun and enjoyable afternoon with good company and tasty food? Yes, definitely!On arrival at Ping Pong, I was nervous that the table that I'd booked for 10 people late last night online via the Ping Pong web site would not be available since I didn't receive an email confirmation. But I need not have worried since as soon as I arrived and asked about \"my reservation for 10 people\", we were whisked upstairs to the lounge/bar/dining area. I have been to this branch of Ping Pong once before, but hadn't realised that there was an upstairs area. However, I was very pleased by this as a) there was only one other group upstairs besides us; b) it was much quieter which allowed us to chat to our hearts' content; and c) the sofas were much more comfortable than the benches downstairs albeit slightly lower. At this point, a big tick for Ping Pong's technological advances and wise decision about seating allocations. We ordered our drinks (all choosing fancy teas of varying fanciness - my favourite of the ones I tried was the lychee and ginger iced tea cooler, which was very refreshing) and settled in to analyse the menu. Another tick for Ping Pong on a special occasion for the wide range of teas that we don't normally have when we go for a traditional dim sum meal.The girls chose a selection of dim sum for the group, which the boys promptly tripled... The food arrived quickly and was served hot and fresh. The flavour complemented each other well - I love Ping Pong for the variety of unusual combinations (like black prawn dumplings). My only criticism is that the steamed dim sum were a bit too sticky, which meant the skins broke and the contents spilled out. We were also slightly disappointed that they did not have cheung fun on the menu. But decent quality food all in all. We also had desserts - the Ping Pong sampler, which I won't describe in detail as it would spoil the surprise - but each mouthful was was delicious and only made you want more. I'm glad I managed to squeeze in dessert!Overall, we had a great afternoon - great company and lots of food. However, I think it is over priced (in my opinion, you can get much better traditional dim sum at a very reasonable price), but you do get the more unusual/fusion combinations (like scallop and shitake dumplings, duck spring rolls or seafood pastries). That said, we got what we paid for - a slightly different, very relaxed lunchtime gathering of friends.",

    "text": "Ping Pong opened the last year I was with my old company, and we had our departmental Christmas dinner at the original branch opposite the London Palladium. It was packed solid, and I remember it was difficult to get a booking. I had the day off due to moving into my new home that day and met my shortly to be ex-colleagues for what was a very fun evening, with delicious, madly affordable food served in a gorgeous setting. My boss managed to give me no sign I was to be fired right after Christmas. My fondness for Ping Pong survived this incident and I went back with my now ex-colleagues (minus the boss) for a catch-up about 6 months later, after the legal wrangling was completed. Again, it was fun. And I've been back subsequently with very different crowds \u00a0once with my houseguests in the summer, after a performance of The Sound of Music at the Palladium, and last week with my brother and the niece and nephew after our Royal Society lecture. Both visits were great. I think my older guests enjoyed themselves \u00a0the Jasmine tea is always a show-stopper \u00a0and they are the type of older visitors who appreciate an experience of 'trendy' London. The dim sum were duly demolished while friendly banter was exchanged with a couple down from the North at our communal table. Some critics have sniffily compared Ping Pong to Hakkasan and Yauatcha. I think the Ping Pong dim sum stand up very well, considering Ping Pong is aiming at a completely different market: mostly the post work crowd; with the dim sum hoovering up alcohol consumption. The trip to the new branch at the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank was a wonderful half-term family treat. We arrived just after 8pm, me thinking innocently that there would be a lull as punters left for performances at the Hall. Ha ha ha. The place was hopping, with a queue snaking out the door. We were told we had a half-hour wait but would shortly be moved into a bar area. I asked if the kids could have a snack while they waited, and my brother started complaining we couldn't wait 30 minutes with the children 'at this hour'. I mentioned there was an EAT around the corner \u00a0but my nephew bridled at this (EAT is clearly their default pit stop in Cambridge). Also, he had spotted the Chinese script on the ceiling and wanted more. We were asked to hang on for 5 minutes and a table was magicked up for us. I was really impressed they even bothered, considering they had flocks of people to spare. Service was brilliant and slick, and the dim sum arrived smartly. Stand-outs were the Har Gau and the squid in satay sauce. The Jasmine tea blew the children away \u00a0my little nephew thought it was an alien pod hatching. The dim sum are keenly priced for such a glam atmosphere \u00a0the most expensive item is \u00a33.99: each menu item comes with 3 portions, allowing easy sharing. My nephew had a series of lemonades with fruit 'shooters' \u00a0these were as phenomenally beautiful as the jasmine tea. My brother and I stuck to G&Ts \u00a0quite fabulously delicious. These were Tanqueray but on a completely different plane to others I have had recently. 3 G&Ts = half the bill for 4 (12 courses) : \u00a367 including service.",

    "text": "Went to Ping Pong last night with a couple of friends. I'm quite a fan but they've certainly gone down hill recently.Now we hadn't booked a table and I do have to commend them on getting us seated pretty quickly on a busy night. However, we were told to go upstairs to the bar where we then had to queue for a table. Being in a queue because we're already in another queue really isn't great.We were called pretty quickly but were unfortunately sat outside on one of the coldest nights of the summer so far. They wouldn't switch the outdoor heaters on so we spent a good part of the evening shivering.The food we chose wasn't bad at all but nowhere near as good as what I'd had before. The pork buns were a delight as usual but the rest wasn't much to write home (or a review) about. Much of it was fairly tasteless and much of it all tasted the same. Was it chicken, prawn or something entirely different? It leaves you wondering whether they've labelled the boxes not because people don't know what each piece should look like but because people need help identifying it when they've got it in their mouth.Due to the cold we all drank tea to try and warm ourselves up and I had to admit that the lychee tea is rather lovely. The cocktails did look lovely and most are priced around the \u00a36 mark so definitely worth a shot if you're sat out not in sub-arctic conditions.The bill came to \u00a345 between three of us which wasn't too awful although I did have to buy a bag of crisps on my way home to keep my stomach quiet.",

Being from Vancouver, where Chinese food is practically the local cuisine, I have high standards for my dim sum, and I (mostly) wasn't disappointed!The decor and menu were interesting, and we ordered round after round of the yummy dim sum - 10 orders and prawn chips between 3 of us. Favourites included the crispy prawn balls (we ordered a second round of these) and the shu mai. The crab spring roll, shrimp har gow and prawn and shitake dumplings were also delicious. For me, the only miss was the veggie steambuns- wayyyy too sweet for my taste.The cocktail list was fresh and inventive - I tried a fennel and apple martini, a basil, lemon and black pepper martini and a vanilla vodka lemonade that tasted like Lucky Charms. Yum! Just one question - when we order mixed fancy fruity cocktails here in Vancouver, they are generally made with 2 ounces of liquor, but I am sure that these were just made with one. I noticed this a few other places in London - is this standard?The service really petered off by the end of the night - in order to make this a five star experience the wait staff really needs to keep the standards high thoughout the whole night. On the whole, give it a try!",

Its stylishly designed over too floors, and upstairs is a cocktail lounge bar where you can meet friends before your meal. The service is very fast, and the dim sum is deliscious. This is a great place to meet a large group of friends - the circular tables allow you to see everyone at the same time. And you can share a large variety of food, and get pleasingly sloshed on the excellent cocktails before taking a short walk along the river to watch a movie. Low lighting and candles make it a good romantic spot in the evening too.",

I went here with high expectations and left somewhat disappointed.. and 50.00 poorer.. and kind of hungry still. Hubby and I shared 8 plates and each got soup. My soup was the best part of the meal. I got the hot & Sour soup- flavorful and spicy and very good. For food we got the mushroom oyster (not great), the spicy pork dumplings (decent but really mushy), black bean pastry things (awful, tasted like burnt pie crust), black seafood dumplings (extremely good, but small- order a few!), prawns wrapped in shrimp (ok, but \u00a0lacking much flavor), sticky rice wrapped in some kind of tough leaves (not very good), Crunchy spring rolls (good, but standard fried food) and squid cakes (just ok, nothing to write home about).

I went here on Saturday night - I've been there when it's been busy before, and it was fine, but this time around we should have seen the warning signs when we were handed one of those stupid pager things that Student Unions hand out if you're waiting for a burger and chips. After waiting for a table in the bar, we then had to literally wave at the waiters to get somebody to take our drinks order. When we eventually got a table to eat at, we discovered that a lot of food on the menu was 'not available' - much to our disappointment. The food, when it arrived, was delicious as ever, but then when the mains were finished, a bill was whacked down on our table, without even asking if we wanted dessert or tea, seemingly in an attempt to turn the table around quicker. We were given a dessert menu after a request... but then had a bizarrely epic wait to get the bill at the end. What used to be a great restaurant is now swamped and understaffed on busy nights - leaving yourself up against a bizarre conflict of staff who one minute seem desparate to get you out of the table, and the next are impossibly hard to get ahold of in order to take orders / provide service. Dining is supposed to be relaxing, not leaving you stressed at constant efforts to get the attention of staff, as you squeeze around a communal table that is simply not big enough for the food of all of the dining groups. At \u00a375 for 2 including service, it ends up leaving me with a horribly nasty taste in the mouth. The food was great, but did I have a pleasurable dining experience? Not in the slightest. The staff tried their best, but there just wasn't enough of them. I would not go to the South Bank Ping Pong again, at least not on the weekend. I think I'll be returning to a quieter branch in future...",

Ping Pong is no exception.Imagine a huge restaurant filled with bustling carts piled high with steamers chock full of plump dumplings, plates of just sauteed vegetables, dishes teeming with crispy fried squid, pushed by no-nonsense ladies who don't speak English and cut your taro root with scissors in front of you at your crowded, noisy table of 8 people about to burst with tiny dishes. Makes me hungry just thinking about it. Pong pong is nothing like that. Portions are small, the decor is trying hard for a lounge feel, and they serve pricey martinis. But even if you really want a chichi martini with your pork dumplings, at least those pork dumplings and those martinis should be good. And you should get more than 3 in an order for a dish costing over \u00a33.I realize I have high expectations for Chinese food, particularly dim sum. But this place is a perfect example of promoting atmosphere over taste and charging way too much for something that is designed to be cheap and delicious.

    "text": "I went to Ping Pong last Sunday with an open mind and bear in mind I've had Dim Sum only once in Chinatown as a reference. Ping Pong from the outside looks nice and impressive. Equally the d\u00e9cor seemed okay inside. Being two of us they did ask if we wanted to sit immediately if we didn't mind being in the sun. It was absolutely fine I add. We considered the Unlimited menu but wondered whether we'd really eat that much bearing in mind the price of \u00a318.79(?) does not cover drinks and some items of the menu. Ping Pong do Dim Sum and they do it well. The two most memorable ones were the Black Prawn steamed dumplings and the one with Turmeric. I notice they sell them as three's so one each and then you have to split the third? It's not all perfect: I found a piece of clear plastic in my mouthful from one of the Claypot selections.I knew I had to highlight this and the waitress quickly said she would get the Manager who apologised and offered us a couple of glasses of wine on the house. Prior to this episode, the first steamed Broccoli that was delivered to the table was like mush and was sent back. The second one that came was exactly the same. More about this later. We hadn't had breakfast and ate quite a lot, more than we needed to. If we had gone for the Unlimited, we'd have made a small saving each - say the equivalent of one dish so be certain you are going to eat a lot. I thought the set menus looked good and took a lot of hassle out of what to order. Any feedback from others on their value? Back to Broccoli: When it came to paying I pointed out to the Waitress that the Broccoli had been mush. She just said sorry.Then whilst waiting for the other half near the exit the Manager came over to say goodbye and we had a little cordial chat. He asked me if everything else was okay and I asked how the broccoli should have been served. Apparently crispy (with a bite).I told him about mine and in reply he told me how hard it was to monitor so much being steamed especially on a Sunday. Is that a reasonable excuse? I don't think so. I rarely have fault to complain so never too sure what to expect when I do - not that I was on the Broccoli - I was giving feedback though I should have mentioned that \u00a33.79 for a tiny portion of steamed Broccoli is a rip-off. Will I go again? I think I'll give it a miss and find that place in Chinatown.",

    "text": "Ooooooh dear. This really didn't tick the \"tasty dim sum\" box this evening.The main problem here was service. It was *appallingly* slow and inattentive; I literally had to thrust my order into one of the waitstaff's hands in order for them to actually notice we were ready to order and take it. Not good at all. While the food came reasonably quickly afterwards, there was complete failure to clear empty dishes, and we eventually had to ask (twice!) for the bill.The food was merely okay... yes, it was dim sum, but not exactly good dim sum. Their interpretation of bao was undercooked, their jiaozi were quite good but also slightly undercooked, the prawn toasts reasonably good, the wonton broth rather gritty and tasteless (although the wontons themselves were fair)... you get the picture.Fortunately, the company I was with saved the evening from being a total disaster -- along with the actually quite acceptably tasting (but VERY weak!) cocktails. It's not worth the premium they charge though, I'm afraid. Overpriced, ineffective dim sum -- there are better places to go in London!",

    "text": "This is the kind of place where I believe timing is essential to your experience. To me, it was busy and loud in all the wrong ways. Coming in on a Thursday night at 7:30PM, I immediately thought to myself that the noise level was way out of hand. Even though we were just three people at the start of the evening, I could not make out what the other two were talking about, even though they were sitting next to me. My grumpy mood might have been affected by my hunger, because it was soon forgotten as \u00a0the food and drinks finally arrived. In short, the dim sum was all in all pretty good. Not mind-blowingly good, but for the price I was more than satisfied. The dim sums are a bit \"fusion\" - far from any classic dim sum restaurant in Chinatown, but they cater well to a Western palate with safe choices like honey glazed ribs and the like. No boiled hen feet on this menu ...Although you can't go wrong with the beers they serve, we definitely went wrong with the drinks. The mojito they serve, of which two of us ordered, was the worst I have had. 90% ice, very bitter, and not a hint of any booze in there at all. We ended up returning ours. We had a couple of others that seemed alright, among those a \u00a0passion fruit drink. All in all I just think drinks are not their forte.",

    "text": "In a word: YUM!!!I came here last week with some friends and we loved this place! The overall vibe is trendy, modern, and just generally cool. We arrived at around 8:15pm on a Tuesday night and the place was packed! With the promise of being seated in 15 minutes, we put our names on the list, took a buzzer, and decided to get a drink in the lounge upstairs.The lounge is outfitted with plush seating and sleek wooden tables. While the space looks pretty, it's a bit impractical. The seats are quite low and packed closely together, which is inconvenient for my fellow members of Team Long Legs. Also, the lounge features table service, but there was no clear host/hostess on the night that I visited. I think my friends and I caused a bit of a kerfuffle amongst the staff when we 1) seated ourselves and 2) ordered drinks from someone who wasn't assigned to our table. Welp I don't feel bad because better service procedures would have avoided the confusion.When our buzzer finally rang 30 minutes later (!!), we returned downstairs to one of the circular family-style tables. Our waitress recommended that each person order five dishes. I'm not entirely sure how ravenous one would have to be to order that much food, but I was very hungry and very satisfied with two dim sum dishes, one rice pot, and a lite bite. All my items were delicious, filling, and well worth the money!The one other issue that I had with Ping Pong was our waitress. Le sigh, here comes the classic \"bad British service\" complaint. But seriously, our waitress rolled her eyes at my friend when she asked for a different liquor in her cocktail, which the lounge hostess upstairs specifically told us was an acceptable request. Then when we asked to split the bill, our waitress handed us a pencil and told us to split it ourselves. I personally didn't have a problem with that because I assumed that doing the math ourselves ensured that everyone paid for their own items. After our waitress took the divided dim sum sheet from us, she returned with receipts that did not match the sums that we calculated for her. On top of that, she added 12.5% gratuity. I did not recall seeing a note about automatic gratuity on the menu. I would certainly expect that for a party of 6+, but not for 3 people! And certainly not for such mediocre service. We all paid it anyways because we didn't want to cause a scene. I think I'd return to Ping Pong for the food and the atmosphere, but I'd just avoid that particularly rubbish waitress.",

    "text": "First of all, if you want a true dim sum experience, there are better places in Chinatown. \u00a0And that says a lot. \u00a0You lose that authentic ambiance without the rolling carts bustling about. \u00a0Not to mention that the selection is missing a lot of the more \"ethnic\" gems. \u00a0I suppose much of this is to be expected given the clientele of the establishment. \u00a0*cough*cough* NOT ASIAN *cough*cough* \u00a0Ping Pong is more of a white-washed, fusion restaurant catering mostly to bland taste buds.With that being said, if you look hard enough, you will be able to find some tasty options on the Dim Sum menu that take a few steps away from standard Chinese dishes. \u00a0Be prepared to use a lot of sauce to capture the flavor though. \u00a0 ~ Five stars: \u00a0The Crispy Prawn Balls. \u00a0Superb, and unique. \u00a0A flaky and crispy shell with a thick, paste of a filling. \u00a0Pretty heavy. \u00a0These were the favorite of the night. \u00a0 ~ Five stars: Hoi Sin Vegetable Puff. \u00a0Also a favorite, crunchy and light. \u00a0I could have eaten five more of these. \u00a0 ~ Five stars: The Honey Glazed Spare Ribs. \u00a0So popular that night, that they ended up running out. \u00a0I was pleasantly surprised and would have ordered more if they didn't run out. \u00a0 ~ Four stars: Steamed Sichuan Rabbit Dumpling. \u00a0Mmmm, rabbit. \u00a0This is a seasonal special. \u00a0The leanness of the rabbit paired well with the hearty steamed bun shell and syrupy sauce. \u00a0 ~ Three stars: The Crispy Duck Spring Rolls. \u00a0It's actually an egg roll. \u00a0Still, I pretty much love anything with duck, so long as it's prepared right. \u00a0The Hoi Sin Sauce is obviously what made this dish delicious, but I also found the duck to be tender and flavorful. \u00a0Note that each selection comes in a set of three. \u00a0So if you're with a party of four, order doubles of each dish? \u00a0Total came to around \u00a311 per person for a group of three. \u00a0We ordered no drinks, except hot tea. \u00a0There is a \"Set Menu for 1\" deal priced at \u00a39.95 per person that includes a single serving portion from 10 different dishes, but the selection isn't that fantastic.I'm used to putting up with bland food while I'm staying in London. \u00a0The taste buds here are atrocious. \u00a0And honestly, though most of the food selections were underwhelming, I was still pleasantly surprised with many of our selections. \u00a0Not to mention that Ping Pong is a frequented establishment for many of my friends. \u00a0While I'm sure that at any other time, I would have awarded Ping Pong with just three stars, I found the complimentary hot tea a nice gesture, the overall price affordable and decent, the atmosphere cool and chic, the service fast, the bathrooms clean, and the location convenient.",

We ordered from the set menu for 2 and the food did not come in order. It was crowded and a Saturday night so of course it is going to be busy. At one point we thought they forgot about us. We got complementary tea and coffee from them for being so patient. I would definitely go back but I would like to try Ping Pong in a different location to see if I have a different experience !",

Fresh lemonade with your choice of syrup/fruity flavour is excellent and the flowering teas are amazing! Really great place to meet friends for lunch or dinner.

We had to wait a bit to get a seat so we sat at the bar and waited for a long while to get served- you may need to accost a waiter to get a drink, they seem a little \"toff\" biased.However, we chose 3 dishes between the two of us, from a VEGAN menu- yes folks, I was really impressed that they had a seperate menu, awesome huh? That's pretty much why I rated high, because I found the food to be really tasty, especially the vegetable-y rice packaged in leaves, and the mushroom parcels. Although, the 3 dishes between us and 3 drinks came to nearly \u00a330, I went home and devoured a sandwich. For a solo meal, perhaps 2 dishes would be ideal as you get 3 bits of each so you can share.Anyway, great food, slightly squished seating, the toilets were clean and smelled LOVELY (a bit like bubblegum), and the service was fairly slow getting the order and paying but not sniffy, just busy although the food arrived nice and quickly!The flower teas are beautiful, and if you live in East london near Shoreditch, They even deliver- lucky!",

The food and drinks are delicious, like in all branches of Ping Pong, and we went recently for the Sunday buffet for \u00a318.99 which was fantastic value if like my friend and I, you believe you can eat your own bodyweight in dim sum and still walk out as if you've eaten a light salad! I've never known defeat like it. What lets this branch down, though obviously too is a plus, is its location on the busy \u00a0chain & tourist fest that is the Southbank. You cannot book, so on one busy Sunday we were turned away, and they are always busy so you have no other choice than to savour one of their delicious cocktails; juices; wines in the bar while you wait. You also need to be prepared to be seated with others while you dine. Sometimes this doesn't bother me but when you are trying to eat your own bodyweight in dim sum and you and your friends want an adult conversation, you'd rather it not be listened in on by tourist's and their young son! The staff were friendly and the service was good / quick considering how busy it was but I would rather not return to this branch.",

    "text": "I have been on a Ping Pong hiatus for about two years, but was recently in need of a quick bite before a show at the Southbank in December 2014 and decided to revisit. I was craving steamed buns, so we were determined to get in despite the queue that was trailing outside of the restaurant. We barely managed to get food, however, and our experience was utterly tainted by overburdened staff and misinformation- I can confidently say we will continue to avoid Ping Pong for future as a potential dining venue.In particular, we were told that the waiting time for a two person table would be 20 minutes, but it was at least a 40 minute wait before anyone made any effort to seat us. Only after we complained were we directed to a communal table, so we put our foot down and demanded a two person arrangement as we had originally requested. To our astonishment, we were then swiftly seated. We nearly had to physically grab a server because we were having difficulties getting anyone's attention and were forced to order all of our food in a frenzy while stressing that we only had 20 minutes to dine. The server attempted to be congenial and arrange for our bill to be presented immediately to help speed things up, but was still very slow in manifesting this and to take payment. We had no sauces on our table and asked another passing server for these, but they never arrived and we ended up sharing with our neighbours. Our table was literally so close to both adjacent tables that we were pinned to the wall as well- it was the most stressful and uncomfortable meal I have experienced in recent memory.It must be acknowledged that they did honour an NUS discount and that I have previously eaten at other, smaller and speedier branches of Ping Pong in the past, but the Southbank branch is best avoided if you wish to enjoy a relaxing meal. I can barely recall the quality of the food because we were so dissatisfied with the visit and were forced to voraciously stuff everything in our faces, but I recall that the steamed buns that I did order would have otherwise proved satisfactory as they are a specialty of the chain.",

The Southbank Ping Pong is definitely one of the better ones, not just because it looks and feels like cool dining, but also because of the efficient and friendly service level. There's a chance you order might be delayed on busy occasions, but overall, I've never had a bad experience here.",

That said, I don't really mind crap service when someone is as nice a fella as this dude was, he made us laugh a few times and that's worth its weight in gold (we're cold as ice Kent girls). The food was good, no complaints, nothing super special I'll warrant though. They forgot a few dishes which we had to nudge them about. \u00a0I know it's a really lame thing to say but I'm not really into the sharing tables The tables and benches are rounded, and ideal for a group of 8 or so. But for the 3 musketeers alone, nay so good. \u00a0With 3 or 4 groups ordering food and wine, there was no space for anything. The chairs don't have backs, which means if you chilling out for the long haul (we were there like 3 hours gossiping away) you're potentially going to be doing a lot of hunching over your table and my back was creaking by the end (I need posture lessons, must Yelp that next).In short, I would go back if someone else really wanted to go.

This is certainly a chain that I'd visit again - the food is fine and I especially love that you can mix and match - and share - different dishes. We went for steamed buns with vegetables, dumplings with shrimps and chive, dumplings with shrimps and coriander, dumplings with vegetables, spring rolls with vegetables, sticky rice with vegetables, and shrimp crackers.The concept is that you fill out on the order card with all your favourites, hand it to the waiter so he can pass your order to the kitchen. Then the waiter returns with your order form, and as the food is prepared and arrives steaming hot to your table, he crosses the dishes out one by one from the list. It's a great flexible system that can accommodate both snacky and havn't-eaten-in-days customers with the same ease as you basically tailormake your own menu. I love it so of course I'll come back!",

My FAVOURITE kind of food ever is Dim Sum. Little parcels of heaven, often washed down with a fragrant smelling tea. I and do LOVE tea.So Ping Pong, known in my circle of friends as the upmarket chain dim sum restaurant of choice in London (we are working on a catchier title trust me!). This one is in prime location, South Bank. Also nice decoration and always busy, even upstairs at the bar. That tells me that Ping Pong is doing something right. So I went in with high expectations. A fragrant cocktail at a very reasonable price (hibiscus mojito, why yes I'll have more please) started the evening well. Then we attempted the dim sum. Drum roll please. Well, in my head anyway. The Dim Sum was nice, good selection and tasty indeed. I felt slightly overpriced for what you were getting, especially considering Chinatown isn't a million miles away and hidden in there are some SUPERB cheaper places (if you know where to look). Don't get me wrong, a wonderful evening - don't go for a cheap meal (don't get dim sum if you want a cheap meal to be honest) but I would go again. Mainly for the cocktails, but considering this is my favourite kind of cuisine EVER I was satisfied. Yes readers, that is Daniel P and his high standards... ;)",

Or so it tastes better because I have limited time and usually rocking a pram to sleep or running after my toddler with a delicious pork rib in hand. Either way, i'm a huge fan!The chicken and crunchy peanut salad is really good. Avcocado, crisp lettuce, chicken, and a great peanut sauce thats still light. Well done. The spicy prawn bao is a build it your own asian style taco thing that was super tasty as well. I'm not keen on build it your own stuff but this wasn't messy or anything so that is a plus. The Mocktails were also really nice. I had the jasmine and mint, the jasmine had gone a bit bitter as it was brewed a while but i'm not sure if i'm just a tea snob or not. I take that back, i'm a total tea snob and i know what over brewed tea tastes like. That being said, it was still nice. The staff were really nice too. Can't help but love staff that fix all that 3 toddlers destroy. Bless them.",

They have great set menus to help you choose but my personal favourite is the all you can eat sumdays (on a Sunday) all you can eat bar the specials and desserts. I have been known to graze for hours on. Lovely Sunday afternoon and the south bank branch has a little outdoor seating area which is great for people watching. Highly recommend! Oh and if you love it get a loyalty card, I've had many a free lunch of the lazy sumday points!",

Unfortunately I'm not a big fan of this branch. It's big and loud and we're almost always put at a table for 8, all scrunched around with strangers and no room. I get that it's how it is there but it's not really my thing.We went last week with another couple, and were at a nice table for 4. The service is usually quite good but on this occasion, our waiter just could not be bothered. Since we wanted separate bills, each couple did their own ticking off on separate papers. The waiter insisted that he had to combine them and that he couldn't bring us each our own bill. After much arguing, he eventually relented but it set a sour tone for the evening, and our service was pretty awful all night. Luckily we had decent food in good company and it didn't ruin our night!(On a side note, the other couple's bill was over twice what ours was - it would have been quite a pain to try to figure it out on our own, especially after a few drinks!)",

Its definately a westernized concept. Which is fine for those looking for that. The duck spring rolls were nice, the beef & spinach dumplings too, but disappointed in the pork bun... disappointed in the fried asparagus little dinky dried up strings came out. Disappointed in the bak choy (the cut off the leafy portion for presentation im assuming? Didnt appreciate just the white part of the vegetable... The cocktails looked amazing though~~ didnt have one but presentation was nice~ sat by the bar~ What I liked: 1. Staff was really friendly 2. Ambiance was great, nice place, lots of people3.

I was starving and decided I wanted dumplings and nothing else so I embarked on a Yelp journey to find good dumplings in my neighborhood. Alex's review of Ping Pong was a good enough insurance for me so I ordered various dumplings from Ping Pong on Deliveroo. Literally just dumplings. The delivery came fast and the dumplings were really good. I had a nice assortment of which i can't remember the composition exactly (that review has been waiting for me for a long time now oops). The dumplings came with nice sauces to accompany it. I'm sorry I can't write more as I didn't get the full restaurant experience, but I'd definitely try one oof their restaurant if I get the chance.",

The dim sum came out as it was ready, and it was nearly as good as the dim sum we had in Chinatown in Seattle. The Char Siu buns in particular are not to be missed. It was all hot, tasty, and in good sized portions. Service: 1 star. Absolutely appalling. We were ignored for about 15 minutes, then caught the attention of the very friendly waiter for the table next to us. We asked him about how ordering works, and as he was getting ready to take our order, the grumpiest man alive came over and brusquely asked what we wanted. It was clear that he was meant to be our waiter but had been nowhere to be seen for 20 minutes. He took our order and stomped off. Things did not improve. Dishes came out in a timely manner, but it took us flagging down the friendly waiter to order a second round. Hot water for my tea arrived 10 minutes after my dry flowering tea ball. We ordered steamed buns that have broth in them (and are served with a spoon to catch the broth), but no spoons were brought over. We had to use our soy sauce dishes instead (serendipitously, our soy sauce was empty so we hadn't used the dishes yet). 15 minutes after we asked for our cheque, I again had to flag someone down (a host) and ask for it again. It came, and I spent 10 minutes waiting for the grumpy waiter to look at us so I could get him to bring the card reader.All in all, we spent most of our visit being totally ignored by our waiter, who was incredibly unfriendly. We were pretty frustrated with the automatic 12.5% tip, as well, as he definitely didn't earn a penny of it. We enjoyed the food, but because the overall experience was so poor, we won't be returning.",

    "text": "Great atmosphere, decor offset the tasty, but quite small dim sum.This was my first time at Ping Pong. I planned to have a quick lunch armed with my newly registered Ping Pong Loyalty Card, Email for a free cocktail and booking for the Super 8 Menu. The Super 8 menu consisting of a chicken rice pot, tea of your choice, won-ton soup with dumplings, and 5 pre-selected dim sum pieces.I opted to sit outside as it was a nice day. It was a little breezy, but every table has a heating element above it, meaning you're not left shivering in late September. I would imagine these would be ineffective when the weather drops below 15 degrees.The staff were pleasant, but there seemed to be a lot of confusion around my cocktail voucher, and to be honest the waiter was clearly new and picking things up. First to arrive was my cocktail. This was a ginger passionfruit crushed ice cocktail. It wasn't very good. Next my complimentary prawn crackers with assortment of dips. Note: you'll need a ping pong loyalty card to get this, but it's free! These were okay. The dim sum arrived shortly after, and I was left slightly puzzled. Normally when I dine chinese, I expect the soup to come first, followed by rice then everything else. I didn't know whether to pick at my tiny dim sum pieces or wait for the soup and rice pot to arrive...after 5 minutes I decide to tuck in. The dim sum was obviously made in house. Both the taste and shapes made it obvious. These weren't your run of the mill production line dim sum. But also left room for skimping on the size. The only one adequate size was the chicken/prawn one. The rest were far too small. If I was paying around \u00a33-4 for 3 pieces I would most definitely be disappointed. However in the context of the deal and extras, it was more than filling. As I polished off 2 of the 5 pieces, the Lychee Red Black scented tea arrived. The aroma was dazzling, and the taste wonderful. Full of flavour and silky smooth without any bitterness. Beautiful. Then finally the rice pot and won-ton soup came. The soup was strange. Tasted nothing like the wonton soup I'm used to and was surprisingly sour. The wonton dumplings were great. Quite large and tasty. The rice pot was the highlight of the meal. The oyster based sauce full of flavour, and plenty of chicken and lots of chinese black mushroom (a delicacy). One of the best rice pots I've ever had. The dipping sauces included chilli oil (all oil, no actual flakes :/), and chilli. The special sauces as a loyalty card holder included chilli black bean sauce (delish), sweet and sour and sesame hoi sin sauce. They were pleasant, but really only the chilli based ones worked with dim sum.So in all, the decor of the place really impressed. Somebody really though about the experience visually. Unfortunately the food (in respect to the dim sum) is below average and the order dishes arrive is a little random. Two things that wouldn't take a lot of effort to improve. Otherwise it has all the small touches I appreciate. Unprotected wifi, loyalty card scheme, lovely interior, unique tea blends. Lets see the major food points fixed, and this place would be an easy 5 stars.",

But if you by from the set menu, then you get a decent amount of food for a decent price. Cocktails are sweet, service is friendly. I'll probably end up here again, but I don't purposely seek it out.

Note, this isn't an authentic dimsum place as such, but it's a neat westernised atmosphere if you're not feeling like going to Chinatown. My favourite were the chicken with cashew nuts and the hargau. Service was decent, though it was generally busy in the restaurant. Allow for extra time before and after if you want to make it to a show.",

The pre-selected order had a nice variety, but the server also recommended the beef and kimchi dumplings. This was by far my favorite dish of the evening! \u00a0The perfectly seared dumplings might as well have been little fireworks exploding with flavors in my mouth. There was the right amount of spice, heat, and flavor to make my tastebuds smile like the Cheshire Cat. I fell in love with the decor, but I'm a sucker for koi. If I lived in London I'm sure you'd find me here regularly... I can't wait to come back.",

The table service here was alright. Although one guy in particular could have provided a better service, because they did a mistake with the menu which caused us paying for something that wasn't worth it. If taken the price into consideration, I'd say a definite no. So briefly, food average, service average, price not justified. It's not a horrible place, but also has nothing I can recall that would make me want to come back.",

The atmosphere was great, interiorly is cool, DJ was amazing, but it was definitely loud and wouldn't be a place to go for a calm, private candle dinner. Also not a place for kids (in the evening) at all. The food was great and there were some extraordinary pieces we loved. Drinks were really good. The bathrooms were clean and had nice hand cream available. We later had a problem with the credit card and my bf had to try and call his bank, then walk to the next station for cash and then that didn't work and then I paid with my card. The whole ordeal took probably 30 min and none of the servers got impatient or rude. 100% recommend. You can eat late night here and then move on to the bar down the street for a fun night.",

The menu is a la carte and everything is definitely shareable. They also have set menus that are done per person. I'd say experiment a bit and go with the a la carte menu. The potato and edamame cakes were amazing! We also ordered chicken and prawn + spicy veggie dim sum. It was so good. Honestly, I can't wait to go back!!",

We had several different waiters yet it was difficult to catch anyone in particular to order more food, drinks or the bill. We ordered a second round of dim sum which became confusing on the order sheet but rather than clarify with us, the waitress just put in an order for 6 extra dim sum of which 2 items were forgotten and 2 were wrong. She put through higher priced items that we didn't order which was irritating and we received no apology or offer to re-make correctly. I hate service charge being added to the bill and in a place like this it seems to discourage any effort from the staff. The area has many better options nearby which I recommend you try instead. A very small plus - the flavoured ice-teas were good, so the 2 stars are for the tea.",

Granted, coming from South East Asia my standards are probably higher than most, I can still count several other places that have daily dim sum that are better. For example, har gau is meant to look like a shiny jewel that you can just about see the prawn through. The har gau here was far too thick so it felt like the insides were not enough. I mean it tasted good, but considering the portion was as small (3 pieces) and not superb, I was let down. The iced teas were really nice so there was that. TL;DR - You want dim sum?

It was amazing, sweet and refreshing with a unique presentation. We sampled a variety of food and the first out was the shrimp balls. They were filling with a good mix inside, though difficult to eat since fried bits were on all ends. The dipping sauce that came with this was fantastic. Next up were my boyfriend's favourite the char sui bun, which was good. When I tasted the har gau I thought that would be my favourite of the night but the last up crab and prawn dumpling trumped it. Everything we had was delicious and we left completely stuffed. Our waitress was attentive, the drinks were expertly crafted and all the food we tried was phenomenal.

Instead we ended up on a rather small two person table outside - which was made better once the nearby heat lamp was turned off as suddenly it felt like we weren't being cooked.Food was fine but the manager who took the order slip from us didn't notice we had ordered two portions of the pork buns.

The black tea was a bit bitter but full of flavour so I enjoyed that without needing to add any sugar.I felt quite full after that meal but the guys in the group (the other two set menus) did mention they could still eat more so you may want to keep that in mind and order a couple more dishes. I'd say ordering lots of things and sharing would be the best option.In general it was a lovely place for a midweek lunch with my team and I hope we go back again.",

I know some restaurants just happen to have big investment behind, so they afford to have best locations, no matter what they serve, or how bad is the service, people just flood in.. unless you have no place to eat, otherwise, don't bother. go to Ping Pong, just waste your money! go to china town, you can get better dimsum and better service!",

The dim sum is great and it is rare to find a place where this type of food is emphasised. They say that you should order 5 dishes per person, but I would say that three is more than enough, But it is nice that you can almost pic and mix and have a nice range of fillings. Or you can go all out and share with friends- the round table s assist this. I am a fan of the seafood dim sum, this seems to be the special one. The bar and cocktails are equally pleasing, but do come here for the food. Prices are pricey, so keep ping pong for special occaisions!",

They then take the sheet and return with plates and plates of delicious goodies. I particularly recommend the duck spring rolls and the crispy prawn balls, but the har gau dumplings are amazing and you must eat some of the sticky rice which comes wrapped in a leaf.

Unused to picking the food as well, which basically involves ticking a paper list after studying the menu, and then handing your choices to the waiter, who was very attentive, constantly filling our glasses with water. I had the duck spring rolls, which were delicious, the pork bun, likewise delicious, and a hot and sour soup, which was a tiny portion that quite disappointed me. 23, 26 and 138. The toilets here are very strange and deserve a mention. Basically you wash your hands by putting them underneath a counter, at which point you may encounter female hands, as teh water is shared with the girls toilets. This is just odd, as naughty pervert girls can look straight at the urinals. Splitting the bill caused a few problems as we had all decided to split evenly before the meal, then some people only wanted to pay for two courses, but it was still good value, I ended up paying \u00a311.20 for three servings which would have cost me about \u00a39.60 had I been on my own, which is a pretty good ratio when I remember some of the shared bills I experienced at places such as Pizza Express, where the wine drinkers and bread eaters benefited tremendously.",

I took the feedback card home only to discover you have to hand it to your waiter... disappointed. Won't be going back to this particular restaurant although I am a Dim Sum fan.

    "text": "Ping Pong is a themed chain of restaurants that sell modern Asian food, in particular dim-sum. They are usually well decorated and usually quite busy. At the Waterloo branch you sit as in most of the locations around small tables, asian style. Let me start in a rather petty way by saying they're uncomfortable little things and don't lend themselves to long stay. Staying at a place for a reasonable length of time is something that high prices should allow but in the case of Ping-Pong it's not always the case. Foodwise, they have a great little menu that's got a lot of lovely items on. There's seafood dim-sum, which appears to be a speciality as well as the usual assorted steamed and fried dishes. Since it's somewhat Western in influence these aren't as authentic as a Chinatown place, but it's a good start. The dishes though are expensive, as another reviewer pointed out this is quite shocking considered the very small portions. In addition when I visited it was very easy for the server to seem to get confused and bring us the dishes for the other tables.As an example of the price comparison, the 'special' flower tea they sell can be found for 1/10th the price in supermarkets There's a lot of mark-up on the 'exotic' nature of the products they are selling, so you need to be aware of this. So, overall on the food It's good, tasty and varied, but oh-so-small portions and so expensive. Very much a 3 star if you're with a group, or on a business lunch. However I actually only rate it a 2 once you factor in that you can't really justify the prices if it's only two of you dining.",

Once seated the novelty of ticking boxes to order different dim sum is fun although try not to get too carried away as it just seems to keep on coming and is more filling than you realise. Perhaps a victim of its own success it struggles to keep up with demand once you are seated. Dishes arrive sporadically at your table, we were given one of our dishes twice plus something we didn't order and then had to argue over what we had and hadn't received as we were still waiting for one of our dishes long after everything else was finished. If they can work on the service element it would be a lot better but the food is fun and the location is convenient.

Handily, there is a bar upstairs where you can wait (and buy expensive cocktails, obviously) and a fair ticketing system so there's little chance that you'll have enough material to write a half hour sitcom here. In the end we only had to wait about 15 minutes as we didn't mind sharing a table with other people. The seating in the restaurant was nice to look at but, because you're sharing a semicircular bench with someone else you do have to co-ordinate yourselves to get it in the right position. The table we sat at was for 8 and it would have been great if we'd all been together but with all that dim sum on the table it felt a little cramped trying to keep our stuff on our little quarter. It's a great idea to have dim sum as the entire menu as in a proper Chinese restaurant you can only get it at a certain time of day. In comparison to dim sum I've had before the menu is quite small and eclectic. But the food that we ordered was good. They asked us if we had ever been to a Harvester, I mean Ping Pong, before we ordered so it's clearly aimed at people who have never savoured the delights of dim sum before and my friend (who never has) loved it. Because the portions are smaller you feel that you can be a bit more adventurous with the menu. The waitress advised us to get 5 dishes each!! but I assured my friend that 3 each should be enough and it was. It was great fun in here - less brash than dim sum at a Chinese restaurant but less speedy and less menu but fun all the same. If you want authentic dim sum, though, I would recommend any Chinese restaurant instead.",

The portion vs cost does not balance as each dish averages at \u00a34 and consists of 3 small peices of dim sum. The staff spoke poor english and I had to translate what they were saying to my dinner companion. Their good nature did make up for the lack of linguistic skills though! The food took a long time and so did the drinks but it was ram jam packed out. For 2 people with one alcoholic drink it came to \u00a345. All that said, I would go there again.",

    "text": "I've been here a couple of times and the long queues are testament to how good it is. So busy that you have to even queue to get into the bar whilst you wait for your table but it is worth the wait if you really like your dim sum. If you're not sure what to have then go with friends, order random dishes and try a bit of everything, there will be something on the menu you'll like. And the cocktails are pretty good too, especially the long ones.",
