Very small and cosy space, but also rather chic-looking, and with decent prices for South Kensington eats. I ordered a starter - tod mun khao pod (corn cakes) - which was all right; the corn filling was a bit on the sticky/chewy side, but the chili sauce was a lovely touch. The service was not quite as attentive as it could have been (water refills were few and far between), and they actually couldn't make change for a \u00a320 note, which was strange to me... It's not nearly the best Thai I've had, but it's worth a visit if you're already in the area.",

I had little hope for any decent restaurant being open at that hour, let alone a reasonably priced one in this high-end area.Thai Square was not only open, but friendly and fast. The price points were standard for London but not for this high-end area, so that was appreciated. I had filled up on free bites from the event before, so just got a beer (only one Thai beer available, boo) and an app for about \u00a39. My husband got a chicken dish with coconut rice and was very pleased (about \u00a39 for the main dish). I sampled his and found it to be tasty. The food came out hot and quickly. I wouldn't make a special trip to come back, but we are in this area often (by South Ken station, the V&A and the Natural History museums) and am happy to have it in my pocket for when I'm hungry and nearby.",

The people at the table next to me were fanning themselves. The spiciness is addictive and I enjoyed every second, but boy, it was really spicy. Service was extremely attentive and efficient.

There are also 2-pages full of vegetarian options. I was quite happy with the vegetarian appetizer sampler (delicious little corn cakes, tempura veggies, spring roll) and the Thom Ke Had soup. I wasn't too happy with the service though, which was quite slow. In spite of its fairly touristy location, Thai Square does have very good food at decent prices, but it's not really anything spectacular.",

He ordered the aromatic duck in tamarind sauce, and I ordered a prawn and scallop dish. The prawns and scallops were spicy, delicious and enormous - much more than I could eat. I ended up eating more than my share of the duck in tamarind sauce, as it was irresistibly tender and sweet.

    "text": "I was visiting London and had been exploring all the museums with my cousins. They got hungry and we decided to come here since the reviews said it was amazing. We got to the restaurant and were seated but the waitress didn't care to really serve us anytime soon although the restaurant wasn't busy at the time. One of my cousins wears a turban and although I don't want to make assumptions, but we often do see how much discrimination he faces at restaurants so we did feel a certain type of way when the waitress took forever to ask our order. When she finally did, we ordered Thai Tea, Tofu with Cashew Nuts, Coconut Rice and Chicken Pad Thai. When we got our order, instead of Chicken Pad Thai, we were given Chicken Satay. My younger cousin who has a low voice had ordered Chicken Pad Thai and we had all heard him at the table. When we told the server, he brought out the waitress and she denied that my cousin ordered Pad Thai. She kept repeating to him and us that he had ordered Chicken Satay as if my cousin was stupid. Anyways, he said it was fine and decided to eat the Chicken Satay which wasn't filling and his appetite was already ruined from the way the waitress treated him. We had been respectful the whole time but yes we didn't leave a tip because of how we were treated. I understand that servers and waiters go through a lot of obnoxious customers and sometimes your mood gets affected for the whole day but to take it out on another customer - a young teen, who simply wanted what he had originally ordered is pretty rude. I didn't want to leave such a long or rude review but I hope this review helps the restaurant more than anyone else in giving better service. We are all human and I'm sure the waitress didn't mean to be so rude but this did alter our perception of this restaurant.",

The pad thai was ok.

This is no reflection of what I thought of my meal. Service was average at best. A smile would go a long way. The food was fresh but over cooked. I ordered the beef green curry and my colleague ordered the prawn noodles. Both flavoursome but the meats were over cooked and rubbery. I didn't think it was great value for money. I would have given it more stars but no atmosphere, no great service and no great food to speak ok. A forgettable meal experience.",

I have eaten here by myself and with friends for both lunch and dinner on several occasions over the past three years. The service has always been fast and attentive. Prior to this visit, I felt the food was good at a reasonable price. On the last two visits something has changed...I just don't feel the 'Wow-Factor' anymore. Just okay-not good-definitely not great. I worked in Thailand for several years, I can take the heat of Thai peppers and spicy food. \u00a0The Som Tum (papaya salad), however, was so hot this evening that I couldn't eat the salad because my tongue was on fire. Even the presentation of my dishes was lackluster which is not characteristic of Thai cuisine. The restaurant claims to hold two \"Best Restaurant of the Year\" awards in 2012 and 2014. Like I said, something has changed.",
