As always with Italian food in the UK the menu is pretentious, peppered with as many Italian words as possible to make it sound fancier - the food took 40+ minutes (sometimes for a simple pizza) and was average, and quite pricey! Okay for a last resort if you're in the area.",

    "text": "please see alsohungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  Well, this is not so much a restaurant review but a warning P. and I were on our way to the Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden to see a play and had a bit more than an hour beforehand to grab some food. Plenty of time we thought \u00a0little did we know. We went to a place that looked quick and chain-like with the intention of getting some reliable food and ended up at Rossopomodoro (Italian for red tomato). Rossopomodoro, as I learned later, is part of an Italian chain with origin in Naples wanting to bring a little slice of Naples to London. The restaurant is rustic and not too big, but there were zillions of people working there. Well, maybe not exactly working but having leisurely chats with each other and fully ignoring the customers. The waitress and the chef clearly had something going! It did feel a little bit that \u00a0as a patron in their establishment \u00a0you were disturbing their evening entertainment. Look, it's not that I don't like people to be happy and enjoy themselves while earning money, but unfortunately the service was not the only problem, but the food! Believe me the food was the most revolting thing I have eaten in years. P. went for the pre-theatre menu (mind you, we wanted to go to the theatre afterwards) and I had one main pasta dish. We shared the starter that came with the menu. A Tiella (which apparently is a Neapolese specialty) consisted of different items of unrecognizable deep fried stuff. I mean swimming in oil, artery-cloggingly deep fried. It looked revolting and tasted of old fat. I think one was deep fried mozzarella and one deep fried rice possibly? Disgusting.Then the clock was ticking we waited for 20 min, 30 min, 40 min pre-theatre menu??? When we finally managed to disturb one of the waiters in their private conversations, and asked them to hurry up, they had not even started preparing our dishes. We did make the theatre by the skin of out teeth, but the stress! Especially with all that grease in our bodies! Coming back to the main course. P. struggled with the Calzone, it was really not good at all and so oily. My pasta (Scialatielli with ricotto, aubergine, tomatoes and basil) (9\u00a3) sounded very nice and seemed a safe choice but was close to being inedible. The pasta itself was doughy and the sauce was extremely heavy and greasy as well as completely tasteless, even after I had put half a jar of chilli flakes on top. Believe me, I was not sad that I had to leave more than 2/3 of the plate because we had to hurry to the theatre. And then it's not even cheap!! Don't go there, I doubt it will be pleasant and also think of your arteries! If you intend to get yourself closer to a heart attack it should at least be worth it!",

Had aubergine balls (aubergine with cheese and some other stuff) with a cheese basket thing and cherry tomatoes. I don't always get on that well with tomatoes when they are not cooked in a sauce but the dressing made these tomatoes great. The aubergine balls were also good. For main course I had calzone. It had a little bit too much bread for my tastes, although it was tasty bread. The filling was good (cheese, tomato sauce, salami), it included ricotta which I wasn't sure about when I saw the menu but it worked well. They brought chilli oil when requested but it could have been spicier. Service was quite slow but there were 12 of us so that is probably fair enough. From our upstairs table, you could look straight down into the cooking area and watch the jolly chef making the pizza. This was a nice touch. Had a starter, main, two beers and half a bottle of wine each and it came to \u00a330 a head, so pretty good value. Hence 4 stars.",

    "text": "This place is a hop skip and jump from my work and as it is so convenient and as there is a dearth of good Italian trattorias locally i wanted to love it. So it's with some sadness and frustration I have to write that TWICE now it's been a massive disappointment. The service is hurried, brusque and indifferent. The food when it came was slop. I've had better pizza from Firezza (delivery, north London) but pizza is pizza...however, if you're going to be more than just a pizzeria then the other offerings need to be at least palatable. My A'Scamorza was just a grotesque lump of oily melted cheese in a plate bare but for a charred tomato and slimy mushrooms. I was starving hungry so I ate it but it repeated on me and I felt nauseus all afternoon. My dining partners O'Bocatino was gray looking, congealed and there was a spoonful on the plate. For a strapping lad that's just insulting. The bill when it came for two mains, a sparklng water and a small glass of wine was \u00a334 including service. I was on a budget (week before pay day is always a killer), as was my friend who was on a flying visit from brazil where he recently moved, and this was just thievery as far as we were concerned. If unlike me, you're not tied to fitting in a friend from overseas, I'd save your tastebuds and pennies for Jamie Oliver's restaurant opening in Covent Garden in June 2010. Having looked at his menu the prices are far more resasonable, the menu more diverse but with all the favourites and you can be damn sure of better service. I'm sorry Rossopomodoro but you had a chance to redeem with a second visit and you failed miserably, you will not be seing my custom again.",

They looked delicious! Whilst we waited we were offered seats and all the staff said hello and a couple made polite chit-chat; they were all really friendly :) The pizzas themselves were oddly lacking in the cheese department, but I think that's because we ordered those ones specifically (no idea why); they were wonderfully tasty and had that great authentic Italian flavour. I'd really like to go back and eat-in to try some other food there. Yummy!",

Today I was at Covent Garden doing my Christmas shopping and saw Rossopomodoro on the street corner with very Christmassy interior decorations, so I decided to have lunch there. The waitress told me to wait for no more than 5 mins to get a table, because they were extremely busy today. Ok, I thought that was understandable. I had been waiting for at least fifteen minutes for my table and another twenty minutes for the waiter to order my food. I told myself to be more patient, since they were busy indeed. Then, another 30 mins waiting for my salad and something like a stew I didn't even order. The stew contained Italian sausage, so I couldn't eat any of it because I am a vegetarian. Apparently the waiter placed the wrong order for me and since I didn't believe him to fix everything efficiently, I decided not to say anything. Would definitely not come back again, but would probably still order delivery from them if I couldn't find any other better Italian food takeaways .",

I tried to be a good lil' dieter, sticking to a side salad to start and the chicken with roasted veg dish, and left the place still hungry. The chicken was paper thin and sat in a tiny pile (with one slice of courgette and one slice of roasted pepper) in the middle of a massive plate, with loads of balsamic glaze drizzled everywhere.I was ashamed, and totally envious of my fellow diners who had great heaping bowls of pasta and huge plates of bubbly-crusted pizza. Why oh why did I decide to be healthy at a proper Italian restaurant like this?So while I can't review the delicious looking cuisine that was being munched on to my right and left last night, I can tell you that the healthier options are..... lame.Great location though -- that is a big plus!

    "text": "Rossopomodoro doesn't look like a traditional Italian restaurant, but the food is authentic - in fact I have had the best pizza in London at this restaurant (I haven't had the chance to visit that little popular place in Brixton's Market yet).As I was saying the pizza are amazing and there is a choice of traditional ones (with tomato sauce) and more authentic ones (without the sauce). My advice? Go for the authentic ones. They are simply amazing.The choice of pasta is fair, and, as other reviewers have noted, the servings are generous.The highlight, though, for me is the dessert. And you'd be crazy to go for anything else than the Calde Calde - three donuts covered with sugar and Nutella. It sounds simple, but it's simply the best, though very filling, desert you'll find in Central London.The only drawback about Rossopomodoro is the service. A few of the waitresses, especially on the upper floor can get stressed during busy evenings. Best to ask for a table downstairs, where the service is a lot better. But, as this is a popular place, you might not have a choice!",

They take reservations, so I would definitely recommend making one if you want to dine in. \u00a0The restaurant is very open, warm woods, with cheerful reds and colorful paintings. \u00a0After a long day at work and a chilly fall evening, I was looking for some warm Italian comfort food. \u00a0I love adventures and finding new culinary delights. \u00a0When I am handed a menu, it is my goal to find the treasure food item, that I won't be able to taste or experience anywhere else. \u00a0In my search for the golden food gem, I found \"deep fried calazone\". \u00a0I thought to myself, what is that? \u00a0I have NEVER seen that on any other menu. \u00a0The manager happened to come by, and I asked him about it, he smiled and informed me that it was actually his favorite menu item, and unique to Rossopomodoro. \u00a0So, I couldn't back down now, I went ahead and ordered it, thinking that I will need to restart my running routine when I get back home. \u00a0If you have had fried bread, just imagine it with delicious cheese and pizza sauce inside. \u00a0Yummy! \u00a0This went well with the red Italian wine. \u00a0I couldn't have had a better experience. \u00a0I also loved that around me I could hear other diners speaking in Italian, and the wait staff speaking in Italian. \u00a0The servers were also very friendly and the service was fantastic. \u00a0I couldn't refuse a look at the dessert menu, as I had seen some of the people with dessert as I had come in, and it looked mouth watering. \u00a0A couple of servers happened to come by as I was looking over the menu, and the both told me their favorite was the dark chocolate almond cake w/ buffalo milk ice cream - Caprese. \u00a0I went for the suggestion and was not disappointed. \u00a0I savored every bite. \u00a0The best ending to a great meal was the house Limoncello. \u00a0It was the best Limoncello I have had. They told me it was from Naples. \u00a0They also mentioned the other choice which was a melon/chocolate liqueur specific to Naples. \u00a0I had to keep something for next time. I couldn't have all the great things in one night. :) \u00a0I wish I could take this place back to Switzerland with me.",

    "text": "Rossopomodoro - Pics @ The London Foodie(thelondonfoodie.co.uk ) I recently visited this new Italian Pizzeria in London's Covent Garden. Highly recommended by my Italian friend Bruno, who will not go anywhere else for his pizza fix, I came to Rossopomodoro armed with a lovely bunch of Italian foodies and very high expectations. The d\u00e9cor is simple and functional with some nice touches like the golden mosaic tiles used for the wood oven. We were quickly shown to our table on the upper level, and were soon greeted by the friendly staff. I found the upstairs dining area more relaxing - the lighting is dimmer and the area has a more elegant feel than the busy ground floor. It was a Saturday evening, the place was busy and the atmosphere boisterous. We soon ordered a selection of starters to share \u00a0A Parmigiana @ \u00a36 (fried aubergines with mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, parmesan and basil) \u00a0this was quite delicious but the portion was on the small side. I cook this at home whenever I have vegetarians coming for dinner, it is easy to prepare and a real crowd pleaser. A Tiella @ \u00a36 (mixed fritters \u00a0fried dough balls with tomato and parmesan, fried breaded mozzarella, deep-fried potato dumplings and rice balls) \u00a0this was disappointing \u00a0the potato dumplings and rice balls were lacking in seasoning and were not as hot as they should have been. Presentation was not great either. A Bufala @ \u00a311.20 \u00a0the mozzarella was definitely very fresh and utterly delicious but again the rather na\u00efve presentation and ungenerous sized portion detracted from the overall experience. The buffalo mozzarella is flown in from Naples and was by far the best mozzarella I have ever tasted. We ordered a couple of bottles of the House Wine which at \u00a314 were quite drinkable. Beyond the House Wines, red wines start at \u00a316 and whites at \u00a320 which we thought a little dear. I would like to comment on their bad choice of plates \u00a0they look suitable for children's parties but not for a restaurant. The pizza names and toppings are unusual in the UK - I am told by my friend Massimo, a Southerner from Avelino that these are very typical Neapolitan ingredients and names. I am intrigued by Fru Fru which @ \u00a310 contains, among other ingredients, friarielli (Neapolitan wild turnip tops) and sausages - two ingredients that apparently always go together as pizza toppings. Rossopomodoro has Neapolitan mineral water flown in to make their pizza dough. It certainly helps to create a fine dough \u00a0it was deliciously chewy, and charred by the wood fire, the dough had great elasticity and flavour; it was definitely different from any other fine pizza bases I have had before. All my friends were also highly impressed by their pizze and calzone, and the overall opinion was that Rossopomodoro's pizze were authentic and pretty good. Verdict \u00a0wonderful pizza base & very interesting toppings make Rossopomodoro's pizze, one of the best in London. Starters were a bit of a let down, so stick to what they do best and you will not be disappointed. I will certainly return for more of their delicious pizza. Luiz @ The London Foodie",

    "text": "Handily placed in between Covent Garden and Soho, Rossopomodoro serves up really authentic Neapolitan pizza and hearty pasta dishes. It is part of a chain which began with several restaurants in central and southern Italy, and this heritage shows in the unusual selection of pizze bianche (no tomato), and the absence of boring standard UK-Italian fare - no soggy garlic bread or lasagna in sight. It is also notable for always being packed with Italians, so if it's good enough for them then it's good enough for me. I would love to give it 5 stars for the quality of the pizzas, I am restrained by the occasionally poor service (at least it's authentically Italian I suppose...), disappointing starters (don't bother, get straight to the pizzas) and over-priced wine. Definitely worth checking out though, especially if you're a pizza fiend like me!",

Same informal atmosphere, same good smell in the air and same good pizza. For a wonderful experience I suggest to start with \"a 'tiella\" and then go for the \"Verace\" pizza. Maybe with a bit of spicy olive oil or pepper. Then you can order a special coffe with Nutella (chocolate cream) and whipped cream if you like to end your meal with some sweetness. Staff is nice but if you don't want to wait too long for your food I suggest to avoid saturday and sunday evening and go to eat around 1:30 pm at lunch in order to avoid the crowd.",

Initial service was fantastic and the bookings lady was very nice. It all sort of went down hill after sat down and the waiter who served us food decided to make a \"kwaaa\" sound like he was coughing up phlegm just as e was serving us wine. Yum.We then proceeded to ask for tap water 5 times to 2 different waiters before we recieved it 20mins later. The food overall was ok - nothing to shout about and I found I was comparing them to pizza express (which is probably of a similar quality and cost) All round I would give them another try but I wouldn't recommend any friends to come.",

    "text": "One of London's best naples style pizza (slightly smaller, slightly thicker) coming from a proper wood oven. Try the Verace for the top ingredients!DISHESOverall, all the dishes on the menu are good, from appetizers to pastas. However where I think it really shines is for the pizza: a perfect mix of quality ingredients prepared in a wood oven. I really love the texture and the taste of this kind of pizza, and the even higher quality ingredients used in the Verace make it even better.To drink I usually also take the Gazzosa Lurisia, that's another quality lemon-based drink quite rare to be found around.AMBIENT AND SERVICEThe ambient is bright and comfortable, even if during peak hours it can be incredibly packed regardless of its two floors. For this reason I often go off-peak or in one of the other restaurants of the same chain (like the one near Old Street).The tables aren't big, but fortunately they are big enough to eat properly in comfort.The service is good and over three years I've seen it improving from quite unpolite to quite good.This is a almost high-end pizza chain directly from Italy, you can find exactly the same restaurants back there. All the ingredients are consistently the same and the quality is on-par. I have to add, this is also why I find funny the rare negative reviews here criticising dishes... that are basically identical to the ones people find and love in Italy (both for quantity, quality and preparation). With a few exceptions, they aren't adapted to the local tastes, that's it. Don't expect pizzas or salads with 5+ toppings, for example. And the pizza is naples style. Not rome style. Not chicago style. Not anywhere else style.",

Of course I check the yelp reviews and felt it was a good choice for an early dinner. \u00a0Before heading back, I asked the concierge at my hotel for the best pizza in the area and without prompting, he also recommended it. OK, no turning back now, I'm in. The place is busy, (usually a good sign) at 3:30 I'm seated within minutes at the last table downstairs. I order the calamari. Calamari, shrimp, zucchini all lightly breaded and flavorful. The shrimp might be a bit overcooked its slightly tough, but I'm still enjoying all of it. The presentation and serving size is impressive. So far the service has been very good. The staff has been attentive, friendly, and yet very busy. The place his buzzing.Watching food come out of the kitchen, you can't help but notice the serving sizes are very generous. Maybe the calamari appetizer before the pizza is going to be too much. I'll soldier through.OK, pizza arrives and it looks great. \u00a0Looks can be deceiving. \u00a0It's good, but by no means great. \u00a0I'm disappointed. \u00a0The crust is chewy and flavorless. \u00a0The sauce and cheese are bland and it's just mediocre at best. \u00a0Not at all what I was expecting. Would I return here for another meal? NoWould I recommend it to a friend? NoWas it a good value for the money? No!",

We weren't disappointed! We were greeted by a friendly host and seated immediately - which delighted us after traipsing numerous nearby eateries with no hope of a reservation! - and after perusing the menu which was very difficult as it looked amazing. However as we weren't massively hungry this was really hard! After ordering our wines - one a red Merlot, the other a white from Puglia, both delicious - we decided to be sensible and order a couple of starters to share - the cheese platter and calamari and courgettes - and the buffalo mozzarella to share. We were both really pleased with the food and the service was excellent - very friendly and efficient. I would definitely return and this time when I was hungry enough to enjoy one of their pizzas which looked delicious! Located on the edge of Seven Dials & Covent Garden so very central and convenient.",

It was like eating squash balls: terrible texture and not enough basil in the sauce (they drape a basil leaf over the top of your meal, which doesn't quite do the trick).It's not hard to cook gnocchi.

While the restaurant is not (very) well located in the west end, it is quite accessible if you that it exist. It has a very wide windows that makes you feel welcomed. In the inside, the atmosphere is quite nice, waitress were neither pushy nor lazy, they were just right for me. I quite like them to be honest. I found the menu to confusing, and as a bad-menu-reader, I ordered a pizza and bowl of Salad (how boring), but I was so happy with meal, just so lovely. The pizza is perfect and salad was freshly made. So all in all the meal was great, and I was very content with the choice (thanks to the first reviewers).

    "text": "Admittedly bowling up at 2.30 on a Friday afternoon wasn't a particularly fair start. Slap bang on a busy Covent Garden junction, they'd obviously been hammered by a long lunch rush and the staff were slightly on the back foot, if delightful, throughout. Bread and olives were definitely not good. The slightly over dry ciabatta had obviously been sat toasted for a while, left over from the lunchtime rush, and a too liberal glug of oil pre-delivery made for a chewy and teeth squeaking start. Olives likewise we're nothing to write home about.Porky meatballs to start were fine, though any subtlety in the meat was overpowered by a brash tomato sauce that shouted over the top of them. They were, to be fair, better than a Frito Misto bowl of calamari and courgette. While it was a hearty portion, after too much dry and cloyingly thick batter, quantity became part of the criticism. We soldiered on and finished it, though mainly as it was a late lunch and we were starving.I have to confess to not being entirely well disposed to the food by the time the pizza arrived. Expectations suitably lowered, they were wonderfully and unexpectedly knocked into a different league by the pizza. I went for simplicity itself, a humble margherita, topped with a simple smear of fresh tomato, sweet mozzarella and a wisp of basil. The other one was a Carmelo, slightly overbearing smoked mozz - leaving both of us feeling like we'd just nipped out for a fag - and lovely, if too sweet, Neapolitan pork sausage. The toppings were secondary, it was the bases that were special. Really special. Chewy, toasty moreishness with a light char and the lightest sour tang. By dint of that, and the simplicity of it, the margherita is one of the best pizzas I've ever tasted in this country. It even edged ahead of my last visit to to Franco Manca, a real touch of Naples in the most unlikely of spots. So did it change my preconceptions of the Italian chain? Well not really. Other than that pizza, there wasn't anything here that would make me run back. That being said, I've got a new place for a quick pizza in central London, if I can get past the tourists.",

I was told by our waiter that they make the cheese as well as the sauce in house which I think is quiet commendable. They also make a mean espresso. Overall the prices aren't too steep and it's a decent place to get some pizza when you are not feeling particularly adventurous.",

Have to say the mushroom paste was slightly weird, if you like humous then you'd definitely like this, however, I much preferred the olives and sundried tomato bread, was just so yummy, great textures and flavours are balanced well. For mains I got the Capricciosa, and wowsers, big pizza packed with an abundance of flavour, the extra touch of pepper and chilli flakes goes a long way. They are great for sharing if you know you wont be able to finish it all, I took a box home with me.The red wine i wanted, they didn't have, so chose a different type, which was slightly much bolder and strong in taste. I have to admit, it was so strong it left my mouth really dry!! I believe Rosso is one of the best places for a true Italian Pizza, however, they need to stock more bottles of wine....... Decent prices, fairly good service, although i did feel a bit intrusive at first, that did ease down once our mains arrived.",

We were told that 7 pizzas can be made every 90 seconds, so a large party would not be an issue. I'm currently sitting at a table of 12 people and we received 3 small pizzas (4 slices per pie) about 20 minutes ago, and haven't seen a morsel of food from the kitchen since. The waiters & restaurant manager have all come over several times promising that food is coming - but has not arrived yet. The other 2 tables in our party keep getting served, but our table seems to be the black sheep of the group. One of our other party's tables felt bad for us & threw us a slice left over from their table - the 2 guys who split the slice said \"if ash flavored pizza existed, this would be it.\" \u00a0Another choice quote from our table:Waiter (for the 20th time): would you like more drinks?Table (collectively): No! Bring us food!Lastly, the place keeps bringing out 1 or 2 personal pies at a time, and regardless how many times we asked them to cut the pies into more slices instead of 4, they kept saying ok & not doing it. As a result, half of our table was constantly without food. Do not come here if you have more than 2 people - you will be left hungry and sad.Update: in 2 hours we received 7 small personal pizzas between 12 adults. Still waiting on the rest...",

    "text": "Eating at restaurants focusing on a particular region of a familiar cuisine can be a strange experience. We're not in Italy, so why anyone would want to ignore the best dishes from an entire country and only sample the food from a specific area? That said, if you're going to specialise in regional food there's no excuse for getting it wrong, and the food at Rossopomodoro was pretty good. The (Polish) waitress even proudly informed us that the entire menu was Neapolitan and they receive their ingredients fresh from Naples twice a week. Some of the dishes had unusual descriptions, which meant when they arrived they didn't match what I was expecting, but that's more due to my lack of understanding of Neapolitan food. I just assumed that \"paccheri with beef and tomatoes\" would be a penne with a bologanise type sauce, and not just tubes of pasta drizzled in olive oil with beef slices and tomatoes thrown in!The service was good, and so was the red wine and bread selection, but it was a Sunday evening so the restaurant wasn't busy. My only criticism was that the pasta portions were on the smaller side, so if you prefer a larger serve, you'll definitely need three courses.",

I finally found a place that makes a pizza base that actually tastes like a REAL pizza and that tastes good (uhem unlike the other chain restaurants I have tried unsuccessfully). \u00a0The toppings were beautiful e.g. tomato base was sharp and tangy, the mozzarella cheese quality was of a higher standard than the norm, the customer service was good e.g. the waitress was polite at all times. It is not a pretentious place of any sort, as I normally ask for drinks but today I was not in the mood e.g. I asked for tap water and ice, they offered a large jug and two glasses with ease. When I left my belly felt light and not overly heavy or uncomfortable NB: (I only tried the gluten free pizzas though, so I cannot comment on the normal ones). The only bad point was that there were no GF desserts : ((( but at least they were attentive and careful e.g. rather tell me no and down sell than say yes and perhaps I may get ill from my allergy. Price wise it is higher (when you cannot get the deal), but I think it is worth it for the quality you get and I was surprised as I never heard of this chain so thumbs up.",

    "text": "After taking a stroll through the Christmas market outside of the Waterloo station, we were ready for some dinner. We decided to walk away from the river and see what we came across. After stopping in a couple of places, we realized that theatre crowd was in full force and we were going to have some issues with being seated. We were about to pass Rossopomodoro, but decided to check and see if they could accommodate us. Lucky us! They were able to... and we got a great spot by a window, which gave us a bit more room. This place clearly wanted to make use of all available space, so it was on the crowded side. Our waiter, Ladu, was sweet and though it took a bit to get the water we ordered, the service was good throughout our meal. 12.5 percent service is added, which would annoy me if I had a bad experience of service, but we definitely didn't.To start, we got a small bread selection. This came with 3 pieces of different breads: a piece of focaccia (it said it was garlic on the menu, and though I liked it, I didn't get the garlic from it), plain bread, and sun-dried tomato. They gave us a little basket with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and a pepper grinder. The bread selection was good, but I would have loved if all three pieces were the sun-dried tomato. Talk about delicious! I want to buy a loaf!My husband and I are quite keen on ordering two mains and sharing, so we usually go down the menu and decide on the two things that look best to us. I was feeling the Gnocco... Gnocchi with a tomato/smoked mozzarella sauce. Chris was loving the idea of the Sfilatino. The menu described this as a folded pizza with tomato sauce, fresh burrata, aubergines, courgettes, peppers and parmesan cheese. It didn't sound super appealing, but he wanted it, so we got it. Boy was my assumption incorrect. I loved this! It comes out on a wooden tray... it's like a normal round pizza, but with two sides folded in on each other, so it looks a bit like a fish. The dough made this dish. It was light and delicious. The burrata was delicious and everything inside was amazing. This is one of my new favourite Italian dishes. The Gnocco was good, but plain and boring comparative to the Sfilatino. I know this is a chain, and I tend to enjoy smaller places better, but I will go back. Sfilatino for the whole table. Delicious.Happy Dining!!",

We also had the Pappardella (think ordinary-ish pasta with tomato sauce) and Raviolo, both of which were okay but nothing to write home about. Overall, good experience.

I loved that fact that the pasta was hand-made and the sauce was rich.The icing on the cake for me was literal icing (cream) that came with the affogato. They served the espresso in a separate kettle, which allowed me to control the ice cream to espresso ratio throughout my indulgence. Brilliant! Also, one of my friends at the lunch, made a bold claim that Rossopomodoro have some of the best pizza in London. I'll have to test that theory next time around.",

I really wanted to like this place - the staff was really welcoming and attentive, the restaurant is at a great location (it's about 15 minute walk from the British Museum, between Seven Dials and Covenant Garden) but the amount of salt they put on their food was unbelievable. Salt level aside, the pizza was well-made and the crust was soft and fluffy. The spianata salami was delicious. The Carbonara sauce tasted very different from the typical Carbonara you get from the U.S, so I'm not sure if this is supposed to be more authentic? I didn't love it. The calamari was a total miss - they put a good amount of fried dough with seaweed into the dish so you end up getting maybe 8-10 pieces of calamari for \u00a39.95...I wouldn't recommends this place.",

Cozy tables and cute white Christmas lights filled the room with a fun vibe and friendly staff greeted us the moment we entered. It was tough to choose and the waiter gave us plenty of time to ensure we were happy with our selections. The kids both chose Margarita Pizzas. They were trying to get as close to a cheese pizza as possible and this was the only pizza that came close. My husband selected Carbonara Tartufata, which had pancetta, wild mushrooms and truffle pat\u00e8 and he loved it. I ordered two starter plates instead of one main. I started with Bruschetta served on char grilled home made bread and the freshest tomatoes and garlic and basil. The two large pieces of the bread were plenty. \u00a0Then as my main dish I had Montanara Rustica which was two large balls of pizza dough, lightly fried to a puffy golden brown. Topped with a lightly spicy sauce with pancetta, onions and pecorino cheese. Never had this before, or heard of it, but it was delicious, satisfying and the perfect amount for one. We all left dinner tonight so pleased for having stumbled across this wonderful place.",

I thought Rossopomodoro came pretty close to recreating the deliciousness that is Naples pizza. While nothing can replicate the Naples authenticity exactly, the style here is very similar - the thickness of the crust, flavor of the sauce, and amount of choose used on each pie. The crust is delicious and they use just the right amount of sauce to compliment the cheese and flavors of the pizzas. Overall, service was great. They checked on us frequently and assured us that it was as authentic of a Naples experience as we were going to find in London. If it was truly a Naples experience, they would just drop the pizza on the table and let it speak for itself, but hey, we were in London. If you come here, stick with the classic margherita to get a true taste of what a Naples-style pizza should be like. It's the best way to test out a new spot.",

There's plenty of seating over two floors, and we were seated right away when we got here (after being told there was a 30 min wait Jamie's Italian and Dishoom nearby).I ordered the tonnetta, a tuna salate, which had seared medium-well done tuna, salad greens, boiled potatoes, crisp bread and grilled courgette. This was really good and exceeded my expectations for the price and location. The fish was very fresh and well done like I prefer. It was a good-sized portion and quite filling. I wasn't a fan of the dressing though, which I ordered on the side (lemon, mayo and garlic sauce). It came out to 12.95 pounds.My friend ordered the gnoccho, which was potato gnocchi drenched in a delicious tomato sauce and covered in shredded parmesan cheese. This was very flavorful and I would definitely order this again (9.95 pounds).Overall, I really enjoyed this experience and thought my meal was definitely worth the 13 pounds I paid. The food also came out quite quickly which we appreciated as we were quite famished!",

Having gone twice now, I wholeheartedly agree with her, this place is a gem!Even if you didn't know anything about it, you could probably tell how good this place is by the atmosphere. This weekend it was busy and buzzing, families and friends of all ages trying to get seats here. We had to wait a little for a table so I recommend coming early if you can. It was the perfect place for a fun Saturday night with friends. The service is great, our italian waitress was very helpful:) I think I have to start backwards with the unanimous favourite of the night, the nutella tiramisu. This is maybe the best tiramisu of my entire life (ties with one I had in Florence). \u00a0This was just delicious perfection.The food here is great too. The braciola beef stuffed with pecorino cheese, pinenuts and raisins stewed in a tomato sauce with roast potato was amaziiiing. Every mouthful was incredibly flavourful and I loved the tasty mince meat and the potatoes. I couldn't taste the raisins, which was great for me since I don't like them haha. Their tagliatella with mince meat and ragu is authentic and delicious \u00a0comfort food. The margherita pizza was simple, good and made in true Napoli style. I especially loved the quality mozarella. This is now my favourite italian restaurant in London! So happy I found this place, I am sure I will be back here soon:)",

My kids, who will eat anything, could not finish their meals. We were never even offered the dessert that came with my son's kids meal.
