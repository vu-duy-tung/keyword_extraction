Come again? - The above is a Viennese idiom for \"eating\"...the literal translation being \"to put something backstage\".Anyway, this has little to do with what I want to talk about in this review - namely the opening of Kipferl's new location in Angel - after they sadly closed my beloved store near the Barbican. In fact, I was a little sceptical when I found out that they're gonna open a new and bigger store in Angel: would they be able to make it as cozy, intimate and charming as the original location? Would they be able to keep up the good service and the high quality when opening a bigger store?The unanimous answer of my multiple selves is: YES! In fact, I like the new location even better: the design is modern, yet tasteful and cozy. Everything is impeccably clean and proper - yet that doesn't mean it's sterile and cold...it's in fact a very inviting space and I can easily imagine having breakfast, lunch and dinner here in one day!Additionally, I really appreciate that the owner of the Kipferl has very high standards and knowledge when it comes to providing excellent service. I was overhearing today how he was training his staff (that just started today) and what he told them was exactly what I have internalized after many years of working in the 5-star hotel industry! In fact, I was feeling this tingling in my fingers again - this tingling of wanting to own my own caf\u00e9 one day! And guess what...I would want it to look, feel, smell, sound and taste like Kipferl!Now, I'd like to finish up with a final lesson in Viennes: \"an Elefontn auf da Blosn hobn\"...the literal translation being \"to have an elephant sitting on your bladder\"... and indeed I now have to run to the bathroom after all this Viennese coffee I've been drinking...ba ba!!!",

That's not exactly why I like to do weekend work at Austrian caf\u00e9 Kipferl, but the fun yet functional environment does keep me motivated and focused. It also helps that there is no background music to compete with my thoughts--just the comforting whir of the milk steamer, and the occasional clattering of plates being stacked in some doubtless efficient manner.The crowd fit right in--some for work, some for play, all for pleasure. Art supply and art book-wielding, bespectacled and sneakered, chatting and computing--anyone is welcome. I even saw a small girl in one rocking princess outfit.My starter-sized spinatkn\u00f6del was an oily comfort, a good holdover between lunch at The Narrow Boat and dinner at Meguro. I'll come back sometime else to try the sp\u00e4tzle, when I want to kick up the fun over the functional. And I'm considering wearing my princess outfit for that occasion.",

The work joe tasted like coffee'd up tea. It's like New York that way. You would THINK that there would be good coffee everywhere but it just isn't the case. I hadnt yet found anything to compare to Vivace or intelligentsia or...well, any of huge amazing Los Angeles coffee places.This place came the closest. The coffee menu is depicted by color, light to dark roast. As is done in Austria, I guess. The pastry, gluten free, was very nice.The side chocolate was a perfect complement. And the waitress was terrific. Helpful, funny, almost non existent except when she was needed. And she seemed to be handling the entire place alone.For her alone this place gets the 4th star. I would probably be a regular if I lived here,",

So we ended up with Hanagrian spicy sausages which weren't spicy. They came boiled lukewarm and with small slices of rye bread, pot of grated dry horseradish (what's the point?), mustard, pickles (wonderful) and horrible overcooked bland saurkraut which was the worst I've ever eaten. They charge \u00a32.70 extra for this awful saurkraut and pickles, so just order without. Scnitzel smelled and looked good. We will try it for dinner one day.I hope they do something about the slow service. One guy was serving 10-12 tables at the back. There were other guy serving at the front and two ladies behind the counter but God knows what they were doing. We ended up taking our bill to the counter to pay.

Service is friendly and it is just a lovely modern-Austrian atmosphere.The only negative thing that I experienced last time was that they served an otherwise wonderful cheese omlette in the pan. I did not mind the pan, I actually liked it but the pan had this metal taste that you sometimes get with metal pans. For me that taste reduced the great taste of the mountain cheese omlette. The other small thing that I would change with the omlette is not to put balsamico vinegar on top of the mointain cheese omlette. I ordered it twice and the second time they did that. I don't think it is actually a good match. But these really are minor issues, overall the place is a great addition to the food scene in islington!The above was my first review. After going there many more times. I have to say this is truly a wonderful place with great value for money!",

    "text": "I am a bad Austrian. After one year and about 130 posts, I have not blogged about a single Austrian restaurant/cafe in London. I have been wanting to go to Bistro Delicat in Battersea forever, but somehow it just never happened. The other noteworthy Austrian etablissement in London is Kipferl. A little cafe just behind the Barbican it has achieved some critical acclaim for its cakes and coffee. Now, while walking through the Antiques Market in Camden Passage last weekend, I stumbled upon a second Kipferl. What is 'Kipferl' you might wonder, after you probably have unsuccessfully tried to pronounce it. A Kipferl is a very Austrian thing, it is something to eat and it's all about the crescent shape. HungryinLondon is not only about fun but also about education, therefore here a little history lesson for you: The Austrian Kipferl is said to be the ancestor of the French Croissant. Marie Antoinette, the daughter of the Austrian Empress Maria Theresia, married Louis XVI and brought her favourite bakery with her to France. As opposed to the French croissant however, the Austrian Kipferl is made of brioche and is much lighter. No Sunday breakfast is complete in Austria without a Kipferl, it is usually halved and eaten with butter and honey or jam. Some people (I am not one of them shakesindisgust) dunk it into their sweetened coffee or hot chocolate. The second most famous Kipferl is the Vanille-Kipferl, predominantly eaten in the pre-Christmas and Christmas period. Every housewife has her own secret Vanille Kipferl recipe (I shall post my mum's if she is ever going to tell me) and this Christmas cookie (mainly consisting of butter and sugar) is main reason why most Austrians are 3 kilos heavier after Christmas.Photo from The Hungarian Girl The Kipferl in Islington now, is a new and shiny cafe/restaurant, all white and wood with loads of natural light. It also has a few tables outside in case the summer ever comes. As I was just coming from a very extensive lunch, I only had a coffee, which was very nice. Particularly with the little Milka Chocolate, which is by far the dominating chocolate brand in Austria. The Austrians among you will probably recgonize the plate: It's from Aida, a Viennese coffee shop institution. You have one on almost every corner and it is characterized by grumpy waitresses and 70s style furniture (not in a cool way but in an old way 70s if you know what I mean). I couldn't help feeling a pinch of nostalgia upon spotting these plates. There is a nice selection of Austrian cakes to choose from (I actually can't wait to try them) and a small selection of Austrian dishes such as Tafelspitz, Wiener Schnitzel and Kaiserschmarrn. I am a bit homesick at the moment, so I was thrilled to find my favourite Austrian newspaper there, and it was even the current one! Kipferl also sells the Austrian beer that I used to get drunk on as a teenager. Finally I know where I will get my Styrian Pumpkinseed Oil ('Kernoel') from. The pitch-black oil is beautiful on salads but interestingly also works with vanilla ice. I am intrigued and happy about having found an affordable, friendly and authentic Austrian place in London. I shall certainly be back!",

Service started off a bit cold, but this was likely due to the store just opening. By the end of the meal, the server was much more friendly.Coffees and breakfast meals were the best we had during our stay in London. Everything was well prepared and cooked properly. As we ate, we commented how we wish he had found this place earlier in our trip so that we could have come back a second time.",

I love Austrian cuisine, and the people that work here are so nice, but I was not super satisfied with the coffee and the desserts at Kipferl. First off, for a first-time visitor, it's not very clear whether they prefer that you order at the counter or that you sit down. I also noticed that they were busy, and service became kind of slow (the table next to me waited for 15 minutes just to get their menus).I got the apple struddle and a cappuccino. The struddle was fine and I like the recommendation to order it with a side of cream:) However, the cappuccino was half foam in an already-small cup. Traditionally, cappuccino should be 1/3 espresso, steam milk and milk foam. The ratios here were way off. Like I mentioned, I want to try the menu here before I make a conclusion, but the first impression wasn't great.",

Nice service, great food, and requisite Austrian-quality coffee (they take a lot of pride in it, as they should). Super clean interior, loads of natural light, and those goddamn eggs were gorgeous. Pictures speak volumes (see below).",

    "text": "This'll be an efficient review because everything was on-point and nothing gets a wordy grumble.I will throw in the anecdotal evidence of Kipferl's delicious authenticity by saying: an Austrian friend gave this cafe the thumbs up.The coffee here is delicious. I love the touch - similar to how Australian Coffeehouses do - of having an ombre coffee menu, with the stronger coffee options indicated by the darker colour.Being of fine Eastern Euro stock, if there's a sausage and kraut, Imma go for it. Here there is the option of four different Austrian classics, but my preference is the sausage that is boiled and then quickly griddled (the other three are just boiled). The snap of the sausage is fantastic, and the plate comes with sauerkraut (yes), rye bread, pickle, and the most perfectly grated fresh horseradish and mustard. It's filling, but not overwhelming, and very reasonably priced around 6.50.I didn't get dessert, although the neighbouring table did, and I regret it. The classic apple strudels and sachertortes that you can find in Austria. I'm keen to return and try the ice-cream topped with pumpkin oil (?) (!). The space itself is bright and surprisingly spacious, with a few tables available outside. Staff friendly and super-attentive. Good buzz, but not too loud.Yelp note: double points for the option to do halvesies on many of the entrees and get a \"starter size\" portion. That helped encourage testing of the spinach dumplings!",

It's almost romantic dare I say in the guise of something Parisian amidst Angel.What you will find is a charming Viennese cafe called Kipferl. I've never been to Vienna (though it is on bucket list) and I had read that this is one of few places that come from their homeland. In fact, upon asking the ever so friendly bar staff who had greeted me as I gazed upon eyed at their cakes, they stated that this was the only Austrian cafe in London. Perhaps, but I was here and I had liked what I had seenThe friendly Hungarian woman bar staff was charming and had explained the cakes. I don't like sweet stuff, especially chocolate would you believe. I opted for the Jewish Apple Cake - dairy free 'Apfelkuchen. Cinnamon, apple and savoury. Check. Not quite Austrian but I love this type of cake. Also opted for melange. I have no clue what it was, but a cross between two coffees with a bit of cream on top.I liked the decor inside and it was bigger than you think from looking in. Not sure if it's hugely Austrian. Maybe would have liked it even more wooden? Or maybe I'm being somewhat stereotypical. I haven been remember. \u00a0It was a wooden feel but more modern. Either way it was nice. I'll stop rambling. Even so, the staff were lovely, the food and \u00a0coffee great. A lovely find here. They even have me a delicious bit of cake for me and my friend when I asked for bill. I even heard a fair few German speaking inside which is good sign. I will be back for sure. Well done folks.",

Actually 5 mins wasn't enough to enjoy looking out over their beautiful cakes in the showcase. There were around 10 types of mouth-watering cakes including today's special, Easter carrot cakes which had a small carrot-shaped decoration on each cake. Although I was very intrigued by the cakes, I ordered a liver soup and hot chocolate first. The liver sausages in the soup was nice and I liked a rye bread which came with soup. I was going to order a sacher torte but I was quite full after I ate the soup. I'll order a cake first next time!The waitresses were friendly but I was a bit disappointed when a waitress took away a glass for water without asking me. Maybe we stayed there too long??",

This place isn't perfect - they were pretty slow to serve us, and then brought (and charged us for) an extra coffee. The waitress insisted that we ordered 3 cappuccinos, although we really only ordered 2 (I know this because I don't drink coffee, and never have, she must just have assumed I wanted to drink something. Ah well.) However all three cakes were looovely, so I still think this place is A-OK.

Finally we ventured into Kipferl that seemed to have a more reasonable wait. It is a Viennese Coffeehouse, and I know very little about Viennese food except schnitzel, so quite curious to find out more about the brunch that they offer. The place is clean, simple and feels quite welcoming. As soon as you walk in, you are greeted with a whole case of lovely cakes and pastry. Judging from the name of those cakes, they seem to be some typical Viennese favorites. We finally got seated and the menu was decent for brunch. You can have a simple Viennese Breakfast, which is a continental breakfast with bread rolls, coffee and OJ, or eggs, or French toast. If you want to go for more typical Viennese dishes, you can opt for some sausages or schnitzel. I went for the sausages with sauerkraut which I thought was more German, but I guess Austrian cuisine is quite akin to German cuisine. Two spicy sausages paired with a generous serving of sauerkraut made for a decent brunch. I think this will be a great place for an afternoon coffee with some Austrian cake.",

    "text": "Sunday afternoon. We were looking for a really and warm cup of coffee around Angel. Everything was closed. We looked on yelp (yeah!) and the app recommended us this Austrian place. We could take a sit straight away (although there was a queue for dinner)We sat next to the cake display (lucky us), so we could not go without trying a couple of cakes with our coffee: Espresso cake and Sachertorte (an Austrian classic). The coffee was OK but the cakes: OMG (specially Sachertorte). The espresso cake was a little bit dry but worth it anyway. The staff was really friendly and sweet (even though it was Sunday).The place was cosy and tidy. Not really overdecorated. They sell some Austrian products as well (they have a small display for it, really cute)It was more than worth it :)",

I absolutely love the breakfast choices they have, but would definitely recommend to reserve a table! Its always busy!Their Wiener Schnitzel and Kaiserschmarren, or Topfen mousse are to die for!If you havent been to Kipferl yet, give it a try! I can only recommend it!",
