If you have a Taste of London card, this place is a real bargain! I wouldn't recommend going here on the weekends, as I've heard it's pretty dead, but the atmosphere is bustling during the week. The flavoured vodkas are quite tasty too!",

    "text": "Let me preface my review by saying that I am Polish and have eaten in my fair share of Eastern European restaurants. Some friends recently moved to London and took us here a few weeks ago and I could not have been more impressed by the clean, contemporary design of the interior. I was expecting much from the menu and was not disappointed. This is sort of a slavic fusion spot, but I was still able to recognize the basis for many of the dishes as Polish or Russian. The pierogi were some of the best I've ever sampled and the cocktail list was dizzyingly inventive (I chose a champagne cocktail as an apperitif and later, a cucumber-peppercorn martini that could wake the dead with its brash flavors)...My sole in \"Polish butter\" was outstanding and authentic. Unfortunately, the service at this restaurant was so subpar as to be unacceptable. Our host was perfectly polite but our server was a woman who seemed almost angry to be there. We were a well-dressed, respectful group of four, there on a rather empty night, so I'm unclear as to what she could have been upset about. She offered no suggestions, so conversation and seemed to not have a good grasp of the English language. At one point, I asked her if she were Polish, to which she responded hotly, \"No.\" I then asked from where she hailed and she said, \"I am Russian.\" That was the extent of our conversation. Later, while in the bar, the female bartender (who, bizarrely, was wearing a blue latex glove on one hand), apparently invited her boyfriend to sit at the bar and only waited on us in between sessions of sitting in his lap and making out with him. I realize that I should have learned my lesson with my first interraction back at the table, but I asked the bartender at one point if she were Russian, to which she angrily replied, \"No! I am Polish!\" I managed to soothe the situation slightly when I responded back in Polish, but I found the whole scenario odd and unprofessional. So, for the food, I would give 5 stars, but the lack of any friendliness or customer service from the staff lead me to subtract two stars. Note to management: Please hire people who want to work there! Dziekuje!",

The cocktails were tasty, as were our appetizers. When I ordered another cocktail, I was given the wrong one. Then another server came over to ask us if we wanted more bread, when we had not been offered any prior to this. When our food arrived, delivered by yet another server, she wasn't sure if it was cabbage or beets. Granted it was New Years Eve and busy, but the restaurant was extremely disorganized. After our meal, we then had to wait a very long time for our check, and then an even longer time to pay it. Finally, we gave yet another server our ticket for our coat check, and no one could find our coats. I had to go into the very narrow closet, where all the coats were crammed in together and on top of each other, to find my coat. Which took a good 10 minutes. We were offered a free drink, but at that point we just wanted to leave. The food was pretty good, but the service was abysmal. We'll never go back.",

    "text": "I'll update my review on this place when I've been back to try the flavored vodkas, blinis, and-if they're still serving it when I'm there next- the rabbit with sauerkraut, figs, apples, and spaetzle. Wanted the rabbit today but it was \"for two\" and my guy is afraid of most meats and probably also the sauerkraut. He is impossible to go out with. Who wants to be my new restaurant buddy?To start with, this place is really convenient to go to after a matinee at the Globe (or before an evening show!) on a day when the Borough market is closed. The exterior is unassuming, but as you pass through the narrow bar area at the front it opens up into a surprisingly large and bright dining room. We arrived 5 minutes before the kitchen opened (dinner starts at 5:30!) and were told to leave and come back...which was a lil weird when we could have happily sat at a table for 5 minutes.The staff were plenty attentive and kept coming by throughout our meal to offer a wide selection of sliced breads--they were a little on the dry side, but good for sopping up sauces. I had a warm smoked eel, bacon, and spinach salad with the biggest, juicest capers I've ever had providing the perfect amount of tanginess to cut the rich taste of the bacon. It was a dish with intense flavors that still felt light on the stomach. I \"mmmm\"'d a lot.The portion size was moderate--enough to be filling, a bit on the small side for the price. My side of new potatoes in dill and sour cream and the boyf's side of french greens and broad beans were good, but nothing special--maybe even a little underseasoned. I asked for the leftovers wrapped and the waitress stammered a bit before asking if tin foil was ok since she didn't think they had any containers. Is this a London thing? I'm used to doggie bagging leftovers out of guilt over the starving children in africa, but this isn't the first time my request has been met with confusion and settling for tin foil.Still, the menu at Baltic was impressive and, since I feel like we sampled the low end of the offerings, I will definitely be back!",

We sat on the back wall under the skylight, which was great because you know how gay men like good lighting! \u00a0I'm sure we were a bit of a handful, but the service was just fantastic which just allowed us to have fun and enjoy the food. The women at the table next to us were just beside themselves to join in, probably because we were all taking turns sitting on our friend Brian's lap for secret santa.The second visit was for a dinner with friends. Again I have to mention the lighting--very warm and just right for a cozy dinner with friends. What I enjoyed is that it was easy to hear each other without having to shout. Dinner food is generally a bit more intense than lunch, and everyone (even the vegetarian) loved it as much as I did. Again, the service was impeccable. Worth a mention is the bar--a great place to have a cocktail before you eat or to hang out after.",

I mean that in a good way, it's tasteful, candlelit, minimal with high ceilings and good music. I don't know too much about this type of cuisine so it was all pretty new to me - I imagine it's a bit fusion and puts a modern twist on some classics. They serve things like Siberian Pelmeni, Chargrilled Bratwurst with Sauerkraut and Pumpkin and Garlic Yoghurt. What I had was very nice and certainly different. Unfortunately prices aren't the sort I'd imagine in Warsaw or Talin but this is London and you know the score. \u00a314+ for mains and \u00a35-8 for starters and desserts.

This identity crisis seemed to extend to the waiters and waitresses, who couldn't decide whether to leave my partner alone to enjoy our food or continually return to our (small!) table to mother us! That said, we did come at an extremely busy thursday night when the place was near enough full and as a result we dined in the smaller eating area attached to the bar, something I was grateful for as the acoustics of the large, beamed and brilliant white main restaurant meant one would have to raise one's voice to be heard - something I find very tiresome. My partner and I ordered our usual plate of pierogi and piwo and we didn't wait long fo rmy first try of fried pierogi (something not indicated on the menu and a surprise since it is normally boiled) I wolfed it down with some reluctance and didn't really enjoy it as much as many pierogis I have eaten elsewhere in London. Paddyman's verdict? By far the most asceptic polish restaurant in London I have visited, lacking the charm and intimacy which seems to characterise them as a whole. Prices are reasonable but again slightly higher than other places I have visited. Nevertheless, if that's not what you're looking for then you will find baltic a reasonable - if loud and large - establishment to visit.",

The food is delicious, very reasonably priced, with friendly and efficient service. Ensure you sample some of the many cocktails and / or vodkas on offer too. A couple of minutes walk from Southwark tube and The Cut inbetween Waterloo and London Bridge stations so very convenient for buses, tubes and trains. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "I came here for a celebratory anniversary dinner with my girlfriend, returning after an office Christmas party a few years ago, and we had a wonderful meal.We started with gravadlax with potato latkes and pierogi. The gravadlax was succulent and smoky, tender and delicious. The latkes were crispy and I really enjoyed them, delicious with the sour cream topping.The pierogi were a big hit with us both and I would happily have ordered the bigger portion!For main courses my girlfriend had the spiced lamb and I ordered venison with a grilled pear. I asked for this to be cooked as the chef saw fit.The venison was fantastic, cooked very rare and swimming in delicious juices as well as the excellent sauce it came with. I really enjoyed this and the presentation was excellent.I tried some of the lamb too and was really impressed with this, I almost had food envy!! Interestingly the lamb tasted more like something I would expect from a Moroccan restaurant; the flavours and spices were very North African and wouldn't have been out of place in a Tagine.Although this was a little surprising this was no bad thing and it was delicious.Service was very attentive and quite formal, not what I'm used to but this is more of an upclass dining establishment. As we were dining two days after Christmas the restaurant was very very quiet, although the privacy was nice this did throw me a little! I would have preferred a little background chatter, but perhaps next time. I would definitely recommend. If you're a beer drinker try and Pszeniczniak, delicious.",

We were a bit overwhelmed with all the delicious menu and bar options to choose from, but we settled with a starter of Perogies and a vodka appertif (4 shots in a small carafe) of Baltic Blackcurrant vodka. The perogies were fried to perfection with a delicious side of soured cream and the vodka was a perfect accompaniment.Next for the mains, I had the braised rabbit leg with figs, bacon and spaetzle and my husband had the pork schnitzel with capers, potato, anchovy and fried egg. Both dishes were delicious and generous. We ended up each sharing a bit to get the full experience. The rabbit was tender and the fig and bacon sauce was perfect. I had a glass of the house white, a nice pairing for the rabbit and my husband had the Zywiec beer on tap (which he said was good).We did not go for any of the delicious sounding desserts, but my husband did opt for an old fashioned after dinner and he was impressed. The bartender did any excellent job with the muddling and had the right amount of everything. The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 is we left a bit rushed by the staff because of the kitchen closing, and I had specifically checked the website for opening hours. Next time I guess I will call to verify!",

I had a talk with the bar tender to be sure. Amazing selection and the mix drinks are very much in your face outrageous. However unlike cahoots the drinks are well made and still unique. My martini was alone three stars (3/5) and that is hard to do. The rest of the drinks were rather tasty until much of the night was a blur. They served popcorn with our drinks and I found that very gross, I was the only one. My coitire felt it was perfect. Again with mixed themes. I thought this place was a dark drink with a rich after glow parlor. It felt rather cheap and touristy. Otherwise great drinks just down right vert expensive.",

There was a relaxed feel within the restaurant area, with low lighting and candles on the table. The food, as you might expect is Eastern European and, I must say, of a good quality. My main gripe about this place is actually about the wine list. I do wish that there was a sensible choice of reasonably priced bottles, I don't have a huge problem in a London restaurant with paying \u00a320 for a bottle of red, but would like to have more than 2 bottles to choose from! Perhaps I'm being a bit pedantic. A good selection of vodka based cocktails on offer. Overall, a positive visit!",

    "text": "It was complete serendipity that I ended up at the Baltic Bar & Restaurant at all, but I'm glad I did, as it ended up being my absolute favorite meal/restaurant during my week in London! \u00a0Originally I was planning on going to the Laughing Gravy based on the recommendations of some local UK Yelpers, but I was turned away due to not having made a prior reservation. \u00a0The host at the Laughing Gravy, however, did recommend that I head right up the street to the Baltic for dinner instead.Heeding his advice, I showed up at the Baltic and was immediately seated. \u00a0It's a beautiful restaurant inside - up front is a more casual bar area, but in the back is a very elegant and modern dining room. \u00a0Upon taking my seat, I was immediately presented with a bountiful basket of freshly baked bread - brioche, pumpernickel, sourdough, and rye. \u00a0If you know me, then you KNOW that I am a total animal for carbs - I gladly took one of each and then a little extra! \u00a0The breads came with your typical pat of butter, but also with a fabulous beetroot-horseradish spread that I LOVED - lightly sweet from the beets, but with a faint kick at the end from the horseradish.For my starter, I ordered the quail appetizer. \u00a0It came out over a bed of wild grains and with a sweet sauce drizzled all over it. \u00a0Yum. \u00a0The quail was cooked nicely and quite flavorful - only minor complaint was that it had a lot of tiny little bones in it that was a chore to pick out, but I suppose that's par for the course for quail.On my server's recommendation, I ordered the half-duck as my main course and this was hands down, the BEST dish I had during my entire week in London! \u00a0I can't rave about this enough. \u00a0The duck was a HUGE portion (I mean, it literally says on the menu, \"half duck\") and was melt-in-your-mouth tender, rich and flavorful, with exquisitely crispy skin. \u00a0It came nestled over a bed of figs, braised red cabbage, and stewed apples that added an amazing bit of sweetness to complement the rich and gamey flavor of the duck. \u00a0This was so fantastic that I recommended it to the person sitting at the table next to me - he ordered it as well and had similar compliments. \u00a0Basically, if you come to the Baltic - GET THIS!By the time dessert came around, I was feeling pretty stuffed from having inhaled 6+ pieces of bread, a quail, and half of a duck. \u00a0Buuuut... last night in London, so might as well go for it all, right? \u00a0I ordered the blackcurrant panna cotta with raspberry jelly and loved it. \u00a0Nice and light to counteract all the meat and bread. \u00a0The raspberry and blackcurrant flavors played off of each other perfectly. \u00a0Beautifully balanced between sweet and sour. \u00a0It was the perfect way to end a perfect meal.My only minor complaint with this otherwise superb dining experience? \u00a0The service, although very friendly and professional, was extremely slow. \u00a0At times I had to flag down servers because it seemed like they would ignore you unless you were actively looking to get their attention. \u00a0But ultimately, this is a minor nitpick that didn't really detract much from my otherwise stellar dinner.OVERALL: 5/5. \u00a0The best meal I had during my week in London - superb food and atmosphere. \u00a0That duck was incredible and one of the best dishes I've had in a long time. \u00a0My only regret is that I didn't find this place until my last night, because if I had known about it sooner then I would have eaten here multiple times during my trip! \u00a0The next time I am visiting the UK, I will absolutely go out of my way to dine here again. \u00a0Highly, highly recommend the Baltic Bar & Restaurant.",

It's a very unassuming restaurant front, with the awning and exterior making you think a cosy place inside awaits you. But nope, first you enter and there are velvet drapes you must walk through. Fancy. There's a courteous coat check girl to your left and then an intimate bar area you walk through. But then BAM you come up the massive, airy seating area with sky-high ceilings, like a ski chateau.Christmas crackers were provided at the tables; free bread and adornments like pickles and a beetroot dip accompany it. So far, so good. A server came soon after we seated. I ordered the (very good) dry house wine and the potato latkes with mushroom, chestnuts and broad beans; also the wild mushroom soup as a starter. My husband got the hunter stew. I was impressed with how large - and delicious!- my latkes were. Two pieces with the edges a bit burnt (which I loved), with a generous topping of the water chestnuts and such. I even had enough for leftovers. My husband said his stew was filling and quite adequate. Extra bread was provided at no extra cost. The soup was a rich, earthy taste and quite creamy (if a bit small for \u00a35). The service was one of the best I've had in London, despite how busy the restaurant was.",

    "text": "When my husband and I visited London on our honeymoon, we were excited to try different types of food, as this is one of the most international cities in the world. \u00a0We ate an early dinner here before heading to Tate Modern, which is nearby. Because of that, we were able to take advantage of the Pre Theatre menu, which offers two or three courses at a discounted price. \u00a0To start, my husband had pierogis (with veal and pork) and I had potato soup- both were enjoyable, but the pierogis were especially good. \u00a0Our entrees looked similar, since they were both breaded. \u00a0I had the chicken kiev with saut\u00e9ed cabbage, mushrooms and boczek (bacon). \u00a0My husband had veal cutlets with potatoes and a fried egg. \u00a0Again, both were very tasty.All throughout our meal, we kept seeing these beautiful, little, multicolored, chilled shot glasses flying around on tiny silver trays. \u00a0I was curious what they were and when the dessert menu came out, the drinks portion featured a long list of flavored vodkas. \u00a0It seemed to be their specialty, so we decided to try a couple. \u00a0When we asked our server for a recommendation, he said he is from Estonia, so he loves all of them. \u00a0Even though I was hoping to get some guidance on what to order, I liked that answer! \u00a0We ended up trying rose petal and mint. \u00a0Both were served chilled. \u00a0I really enjoyed the rose petal!",

They were really tasty, came with a great dip and was a nice light but still filling meal.The best thing about this restaurant is the cocktails (but they are quite expensive). I had the Warsaw Ice Tea which was great and their selection of vodkas is the most extensive I have seen in London. I have still only given it three stars as I wish there was more choice of Eastern European food \u00a0on the menu and more explanation of the dishes and it had the feel of a generic modern London restaurant. There was not much that wowed me there and I felt the prices to be a bit steep for nothing that specialGreat place to go maybe once and if you like Vodka",

    "text": "This place is a gem amongst the British pub style restaurants and Italian / french / German etc style bistros.Why might you ask? Well its not just about the food - the food is great mind you. What really sets this place apart is their in house craft infused vodkas.Its really hard to get a good craft cocktail in Europe sometimes. The British pubs are great if you want a traditional English cask ale, or some Jameson on the rocks - ask for a complex craft cocktail you can get from a foodie place in the US and expect to get a \"u wot m8\" kind of rude reply.This place has a GREAT menu of craft cocktails that are not only tasty but designed and layered so well that every ingredient can be clearly represented in the palette. But back to their vodkas - their in house infused craft vodkas are really the best vodkas I have drank in my entire life. But EVEN BETTER (yes there is more) you order large carafes of them for amazing prices in central London. For 13 GBP you can get a carafe of the delightful vodkas that serve a pair of people 4 shots each or a single patron 8 shots! They also offer 3 carafe sizes if you have more than your date or mate with you.This is a MUST try drinking destination in the neighborhood.For the food I tried their pirogies and their 'sledz' which was a plate of pickled hearing along with some relishes. Food was great, but the vodkas were unreal.Also sitting at the bar, giant vats of the stuff stewing with their natural ingredients can be seen behind the bar.",

    "text": "One of the rare aspiring Eastern European restaurants in London. Having been there 3 times I must say I like coming back.Don't get the idea that it's Eastern European so it must be cheap. This place can easily make your wallet 60-80 pounds lighter and I am just counting 1 person dining. Ok, let's get to the highlights of this venue:- Hidden in one of the Southwark terraced houses is a bit quirky, hard to spot, not trying to flash and make its presence too obvious. There are very tough portal doors needing opening that lead you to the inside.- You walk past the bar, vodka bar which is worth exploring if you have never tried eastern european cocktails- The inside is amazing. The highlight windows that are installed at the back of the house are simply stunning.- In the evenings you can expect very atmospheric setting, candles. It's a great place to bring your date.- You will be politely offered table and your coat will be taken to the wardrobe (a great plus in my opinion)- Menu: it's a bit hard if you are not familiar with the cuisine. I recommend Barszcz for starter and definitely try out Blinis with Herring. For the main: if they have lamb/beef stew take it, it's amazing. I'd rather steer clear from duck (it's rather dry and not really authentic).If you go with those 2-3 options you should be more than full. The wine selection is great so you should expect quality here.Overall, slightly hard to find, but once inside very inviting and emanating with warm energy place. It's more quiet, adequate for business dinner or romantic setting. A bit quirky, but that's what makes it unique. It's not a typical Polish/Eastern European place. It tries to be more refined and to some extent it succeeds at it. Highly recommend!",
