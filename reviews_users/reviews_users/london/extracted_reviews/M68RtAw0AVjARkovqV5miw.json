If you want your belly filling for a reasonable price and dont expect a fine dining experience, then give this place a go.",

I got fried chicken noodles, my friend got fried meat noodles, and we got prawn toast, prawn crackers and BBQ sauce to share. As soon as we ordered the food was on the table - yup, it was that quick! So, the food - prawn toast greasy and very bland, BBQ sauce tasted of nothing (we were both quite amazed at how it tasted of nothing!), crackers were greasy. The plate of noodles was HUGE, but again I felt like I was eating a mouthful of oil. My friend put salt on her noodles and she never salts her food. If you want a really quick cheap meal and don't really know how good properly cooked Chinese food can taste then by all means visit here, but this is just not for me, I don't care how hungry I am!",

    "text": "Back when I was a student, Tai Won Mein was my sanctuary - well that and Goddards, the ultimate Pie & Mash shop (R.I.P). After all, there aren't many places in London where you can get a mountain of Sweet and Sour Chicken noodles with a pot of green tea and still have change from a fiver. Plus, there was the fact that my tastes were slightly 'unrefined' back then, meaning that a pile of gelatinous crispy chicken basted in MSG felt like the height of luxury for a poor skinflint like me. I could even cope with the surly staff and the fact that my food was quite often slammed down in front of me. If I had a good book, plenty of tea and my favourite seat by the window, it was heaven. Then I went back there a few months ago in a fit of nostalgia and it just wasn't the same. The food was soggy, overly sweet and made my mouth fizz - and not in a good way. It made me feel dehydrated, hungry within ten minutes and made me really really REALLY need the toilet. As Sian said above, Tai Won Mein may be cheap, but at the end of the day you get what you pay for. But if you've only got a fiver in your pocket and are looking for a relatively noodly way to fill your belly, you could do a lot worse. (And yes, in case you're wondering, it is much much better than Noodle Time).",

    "text": "Finally we got round to visiting the Tai Won Mein Noodle House. Having walked past the restaurant for over a year, looking at the number of people always packing the place out and hearing its praises being sung by one of my work colleagues I was wondering could it really be that good? I finally found out the answer!We decided to go in on a whim and found the place pretty packed, we were quickly shown to a noodle bench (ie a long benches with seating each side \u00a0its not as close quarters as some places I have been to) by an efficient waitress.We both decided on noodle soups from the menu, it just being lunch and we fancied something light, but the menu covers anything noodle wise you could possibly want.Looking around I couldn't help but notice that the portions are huge and this was confirmed when our noodle soups arrived, super big bowls with plenty of chicken and prawns in respectively.The food tasted very fresh and healthy, we did manage to finish but around us people were pouring their leftovers into handy doggy bags, well actually take away boxes (they charge 50p for one of these), but to be honest its well worth the money. I always think noodles are like Pizza, even better the day after (although is that just me?)You pay up at the till here and as we approached the lady magically seemed to know what we had ordered. The cost (without service charge \u00a0they don't add one or expect you pay one) was \u00a314.95 all in \u00a0but we did make sure we popped some money in the tip box by the till.If you are after great noodles, at an amazing price and brilliant value for money with no nonsense staff (I love no fuss kinda of places) then this isWon the place for you. I just wished we had had something a little more naughty and had to take advantage of the doggy bags!",

The food is excellent, comes in enormous portions, and is dirt cheap. Two people can eat a massive meal here for less than 10 quid. It's fairly large and the service is very quick and efficient. The menus are printed on the table mats and you order by number. The Chicken Curry and Rice and the Chicken Satay and Rice are really good and the other items are uniformly high standard as well. If you don't mind eating shoulder to shoulder with strangers and if you're willing to order, eat and leave quickly, this is a very good place to get a good, cheap meal in a relatively expensive area.

Not a bad way to get an ok meal in the area (especially given the number of less than average pub grub joints, and identikit Spanish places that dominate), but certainly not a venue to bother seeking out in itself.",

All items tasted quite bland except for the salt and paper squid. While each item was relatively cheap \u00a36-\u00a37, the total bill was about \u00a350 and would have been much more tastier elsewhere. Would not recommend unless you're looking for unseasoned or bland Chinese food.",

Because they brought me a wrong dish and when I told them so, they expressed like I was wrong. After an awkward moment, they served me what I ordered without any comment.The restaurant was clean, cheerful atmosphere and the food was tasty and very volumy, the ingredients they use like prawns looked quite nice, but the service affected the satisfaction so much to me this time.",

Then I watched three separate tables get seated and served drinks before me. I had to ask for my drink again twice. After I watched 8 people whom arrived after me receive there food. I was told five minutes maybe five minutes another five minutes. So I went to the manager and asked for my money back and she tried to give me something else after waiting a total of 25 minutes for a simple rice dish.",

Don't expect a warm greeting or a cheery hello as you certainly won't get that but what you will get is good quality, cheap Chinese food and loads of it. Seriously the portions are HUGE. You can easily share a dish between two and still have some left over. The food is great and there is a huge selection. It doesn't feel as greasy as some Chinese places either and while it is more fast food than gourmet, you could easily come here and have a nice meal with friends. The tables are of a similar set up to Wagamama in that they are long and you share them with others. The turnover is pretty quick (although they never push you to leave). The decor is a little dated and the toilets are not the best in town but for these prices you would be mad not to give it a go, as long as you don't mind a 'no frills' kind of service.",

In fact, there are 2 or 3 other Chinese restaurants within walking distance if you want.There was a lot of people when I went that day, but I'm not sure if it's like this everyday. Nonetheless, we had to wait. A long time. Menu items include fried egg/rice noodles, fried rice, rice plates, noodle soups. If you want something cheap and filling, come here! Otherwise, if a tourist, I would recommend really getting your day in Greenwich by visiting the Greenwich market and stopping by all of their food tents!",

I like that because I don't want to eat anywhere and by the time I pay the bill I'm hungry again.Nothing new to add; the portions are huge and food is tasty (yes, it is tons better than Noodle Time - why are they still in business anyway?) Busy - I don't care because I never eat it anyway. Take mine home & chill.Located in the main drag of Greenwich High Street, it's a tourist nightmare but it also has some homestyle charms that I like...-I come in & promptly someone is asking what I want-I pay, take a seat & wait for my grub-Get handed my bag & sent on my wayThose eating in will get their plates chucked down in front of them. Forget the flowery chit-chat cause you won't get it in here from the staff. Just your food in a large enough to accomodate restaurant that is clean & tidy.No muss, no fuss - it works.#LiveLifeLikeLDN",

It was very quick to reach the table. It tasted good, nothing ground breaking. I couldn't finish and had to take it home, it costs 50p for a takeaway box and a carrier bag. It was relatively cheap and has huge portions. However, don't go in expecting top notch friendly service and a great atmosphere. This is just a local Chinese restaurant, with quick services, large portions and reasonable prices, nothing more, nothing less.",

So the food doesn't taste 'gourmet' but heck I pay extra money for messy burgers I'd pay extra money for messy chinese! Its a bit out of the way - close to the Cutty Sark. But definitely worth trying out on a weekend you don't want to cook. For around 10 quid you can have enough food for a meal and then to take away the rest as well. One thing I found very interesting was that when I asked them to pack up the remaining food, they said its 50p for this - which is fine by me. A minute later she tosses a foil container and a lid in my direction and leaves. Packing is DIY! Lovely!",
