The meat is fantastic, always fresh and cooked to perfection. They use a relish which is quite lovely. Take note that their burgers are pretty huge so think twice about ordering a side of fries with it. However, I will say that I am tiny yet I devour their burgers (plus the fries) in minutes!! I cannot get enough of this place, seriously. GBK I love you!",

All of the restaurants along the way were fully booked (it was a Friday night), the rain coupled with me and my female friend complaining that our feet were hurting in our heels; the boys suggested GBK. On entry, the interior was modern and clean. We had a large table at the back, perfect for a group of people. The waiter was helpful, the menu had quite a selection of different burgers. We didn't have to wait long until we tucked in. I have to admit, I was particularly unadventurous and choose a junior beef burger (not just for kids!), as the main burgers looked too large for me. Everyone seemed to enjoy the place and food, and although slightly more expensive than your average highstreet burger joint, definitely worth a try. Menu: gbkinfo.com/downloads/GB\u2026",

I did this because every now and again you have to taste the beef. And the beef was amazing. I like the way you can specify how you want it cooked, which means they use proper cuts of beef to make their burgers. And oh my, as my first meal of 2009, it didn't disappoint. Not even close!",

But finding a good hamburger is another story and obviously McDonalds, Burger King & co. are not an option unless you are really desperate. GBK has executed very well on a simple idea to offer a wide range of freshly made and imaginative hamburgers in London. There are several branches and the Westbourne Grove one is the local one for me. Although the range is amazingly large (including various veggie hamburgers which are clarly pushing it a bit), I stick to cheeseburgers and hamburgers and the result is consistently good. The fries are not bad either. It is more of a take-away for me but the settings are ok. They recently opened one on Portobello Road and I am in 2 minds about that, decent food on one had but another chain outlet on the other hand",

And they ran out of milkshakes and they offered me a fizz for free and surprised us at the table by bringing my friend one as well! Would definitely return and try out the entire menu!",

    "text": "As San Franciscans, we love a good burger. So when I say that my partner and I, who ordered the Camemburger and the Habanero Burger respectively, thought these some of the best burgers we'd ever had, I don't speak lightly. The habanero sauce was slightly sweet with just the right amount of burn, and the beef patties were thick and rare (as ordered). \u00a0The buns were fresh and perfectly toasted. You could see and taste the bacon in the aioli served with the sweet potato fries. We were quite happy with the entire meal.Unfortunately they were out of buffalo at the time, so we both got beef, but I can appreciate that they use fresh stock.Would give this place five stars if not for the OUTRAGEOUS cost--over \u00a340 for two burgers, fries, and two beers. I would take somebody here to show them what a good burger tastes like...once.",

    "text": "Been there a couple of times ! But always a bit disappointed, so yes the burgers are huge, however as a meat lover, I like my meat blue. As they can't do less than medium, I asked for a medium, adding that I really want my meat red and juicy. And as the first time, meat was way more than medium (it was well done!) which makes that every time it didn't finish... For the price of the burger (around \u00a37 if you pimp it a little with different sauces) I think it is too bad to go there if you really are a meat lover before a burger fan! The good sides of this chain are that the milkshakes are succulent, and the skinny fries are awesome (I think there are the only fries I have ever finished even with a burger just because they are delicious!!).",

The thickness of the burger patties vary from time to time and it affects how \"medium\" they are, but I guess that just means that they really are hand shaped and not machine made. Although their burgers were great, I can't say the same for their fries. Their skinny fries are too skinny, and their chunky fries is too deep fried, but that's just a personal preference I guess.",

Combined with the student discount, 5 star food and prices, no question. \u00a0The pesto burger, habanero burger, and blue cheese burgers are all fantastic and so overloaded with toppings that drip over that ordering dips for chips is superfluous. I did, however, once have a bad service experience here. GBK offers a 40% discount to students, but one must acquire a GBK student card which are available at select (but as far as I can tell unpredictable) locations in limited number. \u00a0I got sneered at for asking what locations might have student cards as this one didn't, and was told they \"never get them at this location\" with an unmistakable sneer and annoyance. (oddly enough, 2 weeks later, they DID have student cards here - so our sneerer was misinformed) \u00a0Since then, I\"ve had some great customer service experiences, but this one sticks out enough that it is costing GBK a fifth star.",
