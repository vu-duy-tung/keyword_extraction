Although a different layout and vibe to its Covent Garden cousin, the Westfield Wahaca retains the relaxed buzz of the concept. Our favourite plates? fish escabeche in delicious marinade, shrimp ceviche with citrussy tang and nopalitos - bring on the cactus! We love the margaritas and while the sun is still shining I'll be heading back to try their seasonal Devon Crab.",

    "text": "My partner and I were at Westfield on Saturday, valentines day, and decided on Wahaca. He had eaten there before but I hadn't. I'm not a fan of spicy food but he assured me mexican isn't too spicy and the menu we looked at clearly marked which items were spicy and which weren't. We were there around 2pm, there was a little bit of a queue but it wasn't too bad and went down very quickly, I don't think we queued for more than 4 or 5 minutes. The menu had a lovely big selection and included a section where it recommended you select 2 or 3 different dishes, or more if you were sharing. They were very reasonably priced, most seemed to be around \u00a33 or 4. In the end we ordered 5 between us. Our waiter was a lovely enthusiastic guy called Rob who was very helpful when we were making our decisions. The food arrives as it's ready rather than all together. This was great as it means you don't wait too long and can start eating as soon as items arrive. My only problem was some items came in batches of 3 which makes sharing complicated! I'd rather 4 smaller items or 2 larger, but it all got eaten in the end. The only thing I wasn't keen on was a black bean and cheese thing. It was like a pancake folded in half, for the life of me I can't recall its name. It tasted great until I bit into a hard bean and it was seriously aniseed flavoured. I can't stand aniseed so I had to spit that bit out, but even then, my mouth was full of the flavour. I'm not sure why that one had the flavour but the rest didn't, I wouldn't have ordered it if I'd read that it had that flavour. Everything else was lovely, I had a sparkling lime drink and it was very refreshing. The bill for two of us came to just below \u00a330 which seemed reasonable.",

    "text": "Wahaca - Pics @ The London Foodie(thelondonfoodie.co.uk ) I was one of the 30 lucky Qypers (mostly food bloggers) who were invited to taste Wahaca's new autumn menu at their Westfield branch. Having experienced some disastrous meals at other Mexican restaurants in London, I had steered clear of this cuisine until now. I had never visited Wahaca before and was looking forward to the evening ahead. I was truly impressed by the food I tasted, and feel now a growing curiosity to learn more about this type of cooking. Most impressive however, was meeting and dining with the founders Tommi (Thomasina Miers, winner of 2005 Masterchef), Mark Selby and his wife, the gorgeous Cecilia, who runs Wahaca's blog. Their enthusiasm, passion and knowledge of Mexican cuisine were contagious, and made our evening memorable. We had a useful introduction by Tommi and Mark of the dishes that we would be tasting, and the three types of tequilas to accompany them. We started the evening with a lovely dish of Smoked Herring Tostada (\u00a33.75) - shredded smoked herring in a Veracruzan sauce (made mainly of olive oil, capers, tomatoes, chillies and various herbs) on tortillas. I enjoyed this and felt that the fish and slightly tart sauce married well. To follow, we had what I think was one of the best dishes of the evening \u00a0Black Bean and Chicken Soup (\u00a36.75). Served with shredded chicken, diced avocado, feta cheese, cream, ancho chillies and totopo (a type of corn tortilla), these were topped by a creamy and rich soup of black beans. The contrasting combination of flavours and textures was a revelation despite the odd appearence, with the ancho chillies giving a spicy but sweet, almost chocolatey quality to the dish. The Huitlacoche Quesadillas (\u00a33.75) with corn, mushroom and cheese, were also good. Huitlacoche is a fungus that grows on the ears of corn, it has a very pungent earthy flavour reminiscent of mushroom and corn. I could easily have a few of those with some cold beer. Their Winter Fuerza Salad (\u00a36.90) was next, a combination of roasted butternut squash, spelt, diced orange, ancho chillies, feta, avocado, and other ingredients. This was a hearty salad, combining two of my favourite salad ingredients \u00a0butternut squash & feta. I will certainly try this again. To accompany the salad, we also had Pork Pibil (\u00a33.75), a traditional Mexican slow roasted pork dish from Yucatan Peninsula, marinated in a lime based sauce and slow roasted in banana leaves. This was one of the highlights of the evening, the meat was succulent, sweet and tender. Wahaca's Vegetable Pipian (\u00a37.75) was our next course. Pipian is a traditional mole type sauce used to accompany poultry. It is popular in the North East region of Mexico, consisting mostly of ground nuts, garlic, onions, chillies, and chocolate. Wahaca's vegetarian take was intriguing and bursting with flavours of fresh herbs and ground green pumpkin seeds. The addition of rice and mushrooms was a good alternative to the usual chicken. I loved the richness of this sauce soaked up by the fluffy rice and meaty mushrooms. This was a truly warming winter dish I look forward to trying again. This was followed by Baja-California Fish Tacos (\u00a37.75), crispy fried fish goujons with chipotle mayonnaise in a delicious tomato salsa served on large tacos. This was an easy going dish that anyone would struggle to fault but not particularly memorable in comparison to some of the other dishes. The enchilada with mole (\u00a38.75) was creamy and rich, and partnered well with the tender pieces of shredded chicken, rice and other ingredients. This was a meaty alternative to the earlier Vegetable Pipian; a sophisticated sauce with hints of chocolate, chillies, onions, and garlic. Next on the list was the Fish a la Veracruzana (\u00a39.95), a parcel of Pollock fillet slow cooked in a Veracruzan sauce (made mainly of olive oil, capers, tomatoes, chillies and various herbs) and served with coriander rice. The accompanying fresh salsa was a nice addition to the green rice and fish. The last of our main courses was the Vegetable Burrito (\u00a36), made of toasted flour tortillas filled with coriander rice, and served with corn chips and tomato salsa. For dessert we had a platter of hot, crispy Churros y Chocolate (\u00a33.40). I remember having similar ones in Madrid, although there the hot chocolate was much denser. I found Wahaca's particularly good and preferred the less glutinous texture of the rich hot chocolate. This was the perfect ending to a wonderful Mexican meal. We also tasted three of their finest tequilas \u00a0a Blanco, a Reposado and an A\u00f1ejo (aged version). They had distinct characteristics and were smooth and partnered well with the evening's dishes. It was a great event for which I would like to thank the organiser Chris from Qype, and Tommi, Mark & Cecilia for their kindness and hospitality. It was also a great pleasure to meet people whose blogs I had been inspired by: Su-Lin of Tamarind & Thyme and Mel and",

It has that great relaxed, canteen-style vibe about it - and at the same time, a sense of subtle style, that the food is the important thing. The waiters are friendly and knowledgable, and the only problem with the menu was the fine print (ie not all the words were clearly visible) Of the winter sampling menu that I erm... sampled ... the thing that will DEFINITELY be bringing me back will be the corn mushroom quesadilla goodness, the black bean soup (then again, I've always loved black bean soup) and the fish tacos were a pleasant surprise. As was the pollock. The pork pibils dripped off the tongue as they should, and the tequilas were very sharp. A bit too sharp, as I found out the next morning... The prices seemed very reasonable - certainly better than Wagamama's - and a cut above the rest of the faux-posh restaurants that seem to infect Westfield. Definitely a must-go.",

The good times have been a visit with a friend who has a mexican wife (and knows the cuisine well) and my most recent, being the Qype winter menu sampling extravaganza. The less-good times have been more 'normal' visits. A quick burrito here, a snatched Modelo and taco there. The differentiator is having someone choose my dishes. I'm pretty clueless about 'proper' Mexican street food, and nine times out of ten will plump for the lowest common denominator burrito / chimichanga / enchilada option, since I'm a shameless SoCa Mexican fast food fan. There's no doubt that Wahaca are serving London's best all-round Mexican menu. What's letting them down are the basics. The chicken burrito is a big (if not physically small) disappointment. Not as good as other burrito specialists that are popping up all over town at the moment. Not as good as some of the more original menu items which could get passed over for the safe option. I love what they're doing with Tequila. It's definitely not a six-beers-down, salt-lick, slug, lemon-slice experience. I liked having it with food. Give it a shot. Stating the obvious, this is the best place to eat at Westfield.",

I'm quite fond of Westfield, following my apprehension before it was built (being a resident of She' Bu'). And it just seems to keep giving. Wahaca (the original place in Mexico is Oaxaca, I think) is one of the restaurants on the Southern Terrace which have some nice cosmopolitan outdoor areas (warmed by earth destroying patio heaters - but oh so lovely) and trendy seating across a couple of floors inside. It's happening, it's friendly, it's reasonably priced. But most of all, the food is flipping marvellous. There's another one in Covent Garden (the first, I believe) and the last time I tried to get in there it was too busy. This is the only problem with Wahaca. But persevere through the crowds, wait those 20 mins to get seated, and order the selection if you don't know what to get. It's ruddy lush.",

But the arrival of Wahaca? That's got me looking covetously westwards. Light, healthy, delicious and excellent value - it's perfect shopping fare. It's also good to see a chain expand at a sensible pace. The quality of the Covent Garden original has clearly been maintained here, and the staff are similarly passionate. I've long maintained Mexican is my favourite cuisine. Thanks to Wahaca, people are starting to realise that I'm not insane or addicted to beans",

They had a nice selection of cocktails and Mexican beer too. I appreciated that.However, the service is so abominable that it doesn't really matter. Absolutely awful.I mean, pleasant like a stupid dog, but about as effective as a crime fighting companion as said stupid dog, to use the popular aphorism.It could be the best in London.

I always thought my first visit would be to the one in Covent Garden, but as I had tickets to see Florence and the Machine at Shepherds Bush Empire last week I thought I would see what the restaurants had to offer at Westfield. We chose Wahaca over the plethora of other restaurants available and we were pleasantly surprised, although the service was a little slow in places. My cousin and I chose a selection of the 'tapas' style dishes, which was great, because we really couldn't decide on one big main dish each. Unfortunately we were chatting a little too much when we first arrived and had to ask the waiter to come back twice. However, it then took him about 20 mins to come back and find us a third time and in retrospect I wish we had just ordered drinks and some tortilla chips and a dip to munch on whilst we mulled the menu over. The menu is vast and wide, which is great and our waiter gave a very helpful overview of everything that they have to offer, as we were Wahaca rookies. Once we had ordered our food everything came in a pretty timely manner and we had eaten and paid up within half an hour or so. Just a shame it took so long to actually get our order in, despite taking a little while to decide. Would definitely return as the food was tasty and good value.",

I loved the Frijoles (black beans) and can eat them by the bucket load. Their spicy red and green salsa have a kick about them and full flavour. Westfield albeit clinical is a better place with this place around. You have plenty of choice of food and good to see use of Pork Tacos. You can only seem to get them in the States or Mexico!!! You have the usual Quesadillas, Taco, Tortillas etc and their Burrito is big and tasty. You only need one and for under \u00a37 a bargain. I had to try everything and waiter seemed to know his stuff and choices were all spot on. Is a fav of mine and the price is good with dinner and ate like King and Queen for \u00a330 and \u00a340 inclusive of drinks. We did not drink too much.

I'm sure the food probably wasn't much different but I felt the service in Westfield was really good, considering the size of the place and the amount of people in there. We were given a very warm welcome by an upbeat, friendly member of staff. Fortunately not the Catherine Tate from the Garfunkel / TGI Friday restaurant spoof over chirpy friendliness. As a previous reviewer has said the food may not be authentically real Mexican street food (I've been to Mexico and had street food there) but they certainly haven't taken the easy route of going down the completely bland Tex/Mex route. The pork pibil tacos were good. The salsa that come with the chips very fresh and tangy. The chili sauce on the tables is pretty hot so use sparingly unless you like super hot sauce. It's very good value for money and the price means that you can get to try a number of small dishes, rather than going for a big platter of food. Nice touch at the end of being given a little book of Grow your own chilli seeds.",

I guess this restaurant is still my favourite but lately it has manage to disappoint me and is loosing it's position quickly against other mexican restaurants in town. It's obviously not my first time in here or any other branch of wahaca and i feel like it's losing the initial passion that you could feel when the company was getting bigger and hotter, this time there's a few things i didn't enjoy as much nor my friend, the pork pibil tacos were really dry in comparison with all the other times, I finally found the problem with the ceviche tostadas they put mayonnaise on them and this ruins the taste completely; I asked a blonde and short distracted manager why is this dish prepared like that (the description in the menu is not accurate) and she said because that's the recipe well i happen to be mexican and that's not the recipe, and it can even be very unpleasant for lactose intolerant. The pork scratches were 50% rock and 50% pork, the chicken tinga tacos were a bit odd and with only 2 tiny cubes of chicken each, and the waiter was very slow bringing the food and clearing the plates. Now on the other hand, the dulce de leche ice cream had a very nice taste with a hit of chocolate chips, the tamarind margarita was well balanced and the michelada well executed, the table was clean, the reception at the door agile and the waiter was polite and receptive but not the quickest, the rest of the team seems to be caring only for their own section and not playing as a team. Ambiance was good and the toilets were well kept. Stations were a bit messy but overall it was ok. I'm changing my rating for a 3 star and hopefully next time i can give this cool restaurant a better rating! see my last review above: (I'm a fan of mexican food and an avid critic of it. Wahaca is a trendy chain of mexican street food, the menu gladly is not texmex or mexican wannabe, they actually have a nice selection of some classic mexican dishes including my personal favourite and a must try; tacos of pork pibil. Quesadillas are really good the cheese is well melted and they use fresh market ingredients. Service is really quick, not as personal as I expect to be served but ok. Hibiscus water is not good at all, but on the other hand the Michelada is well seasoned and they do it with proper mexican beers. Overall is always a good experience to be in any of the Wahaca branches for a quick lunch or dinner first review on 21/03/11)",

They have a variety of margaritas that sound interesting, but they taste a bit \"off\" for some reason.

However thats as close as it gets to the real thing, most eateries in Mexico will have at least two fresh salsas on the table along with something to dip in it as soon as you arrive. The option is available here, but you have to pay for it. The other essentials are some slices of lime.The staff are very friendly and sport some nice themed t-shirts.Now to the food, the tacos are in the correct tortillas, however they seemed like the long life version sold in mexican supermarkets and not the traditional fresh ones you expect in a market. The cochinita (pork pibil) tasted very much like it came out a tin. The chicken tinga was basically strips of chicken in a watery tomato sauce, when tinga should be desmenusada or shreded meat.The beans looked ok, however they had a strong hint of aniseed, something I have never tasted in mexican beans. The salsas were flavourless, I was specially disappointed by the green salsa that seemed to be missing any tomatillos (green tomatoes). The habanero sauce was also a let down, it tasted sweet.On to the agua fresca that could have done with a little more variety, the hibiscus is called Jamaica over there and is not the only flavour of agua fresca you find (expect horchata, tamarindo, cebada or many other options in a real Mexican eatery).I could go on and on with what was wrong with the food, like no Oaxaca cheese in the quesadillas or the chorizo and potato with no chorizo, however that would be against the point of my review. We are in London and the effort done in this establishment is remarkable, they could have easily taken the easy route and dished out texmex crap that is sold in this country like Mexican food. Wahaca instead tries to give you an idea of what Mexican food is and hopefully will make you save up some money and visit Mexico on you next holiday. If you are going that far and feel adventurous, try and leave your hotel or resort and head for the market.",

    "text": "Mexican food is to an American what a curry is to an Englishman. It's a staple of our diets, particularly if you're an American from one of the cities or states in the US with a major Mexican population. I knew the obvious, which was that there weren't bound to be a ton of Mexican restaurants in London and that the quality of the food wasn't likely to be what I was used to back home in Chicago. But the food at Wahaca is pretty good overall. Stay away from the quesadillas; have the tacos. Try the salsas and guac. Ask for more than one pot of tortilla chips. As for prices - no, this isn't like the typical Mexican spot in the US where you get your endless salsa and chips for nothing. Everything is a la carte and while nothing is individually too expensive, that may be what drives up the overall bill. Of course, it would be a more pleasant place if the service was less pridefully crappy. Most of these reviews are by Americans, and yes, we may have a higher standard for service. But this place is bad even by an English measurement.",

    "text": "I love Mexican food and appreciate good service and the two times I have been there I have had a less than satisfactory experience. Both times the same waiter has spoiled what should have been a perfect meal, despite the food being served inconsistently. The waiter was male and has brown middle parted floppy hair, upon greeting us I was under the impression he was pleased to have our custom and we were polite and appreciative back to him. First occasion my wife ordered the steak salad and asked for it rare, it arrived 5-8 mins after my dish and was thoroughly cooked through, she asked for his opinion on whether that was a rare steak, he begrudgingly took at back and returned with a rare one and then said in a patronising tone, eyebrows raised there, is this one better for you?.No apology just that we had caused him a real inconvenience. 2nd visit we had hoped it was just on off day and we are all human we all have off days \u00a0up all night, headache, struggling to make ends meet, argument with our partner, etc. And also perhaps we would be lucky enough to get a different member of the waiting staff, but no the same one came and was welcoming enough and helped us choose something he thought we might find tasty, top marks, the food was indeed excellent, but the gap between receiving my food compared with my wife's left me feeling like they had forgotten my order, so she had virtually finished by the time I got mine, no bother though, people forget. Then we came to pay, my wife's card, despite having ample funds on it was declined and his response was to tilt his head raise his eyebrows and announce very loudly and with a patronising tone decliiiiined so every one in earshot could hear, do you have another card perhaps that one has something you can use to pay for it.er actually there's no problem with that account it has ample funds on it, then said in a lower less gleeful way oh well I have been having trouble with this card reader and he tried it again, the payment was taken, no apology and then upon seeing that the tip he was expecting was not given a very quick, terse and sarcastic thank you. Unfortunately until he leaves the service can only be seen from a below par perspective. Just been back this weekend \u00a0although why we bothered I am struggling to find the answer to \u00a0apart from the food was again very tasty. However this time round we were served by a more friendly couple of waitresses, all 5 of us ordered, 4 meals came and we waited, started eating ours to save it from getting coldand waited and asked the waitress for the 5th dishand waited and she came back and we asked again and were given the excuse oh that one takes longer than the others so I'll see if its ready. Utter rubbish, we watched others who arrived after us getting served the same dish. She returned with it and it had clearly been waiting on the side for some time as was cold to lukewarm. Next we noticed that a portion of rice was missing excuse me we ordered a rice and it hasn't arrived just as we were finishing our meals, so she nipped off and got it, no sorry, and it was charged on the bill.What are you meant to eat that rice with, well there was nothing to eat it with so I guess I answered my own question. The bill arrived and as 5 of us were dining service had automatically been added, why? Do you get any better service if 3 or 4 of you eat, well I hope you don't get worse. Sadly this place has the intention of good mexican food which benefits from the Westfield passing crowd, I wonder how many of the diners give it an ill advised return journey?",

    "text": "What an honour to be asked to try the new Winter Menu before everyone else! Being a complete novice when it comes to real Mexican food this was a new and exciting experience made all the more special by having the provenance (MSC fish and locally sourced veg etc) and inspiration of all the dishes explained to us by the passionate duo of Mark and Tommi before we tucked into the feast. Even before then I'd been eating the best guacamole I've ever been served in a restaurant.There were too many dishes to mention them all but the Baja California Tacos were irresistible as were the Quesadilla with Huitlacoche and Mushrooms that grow on corn (Mexican truffles!). The most unexpected pleasures were a wonderfully zingy salad with butternut squash and the black bean soup which was so full of surprises it almost deserves a review of it's own. The bowl was filled with goodies like avocado and roasted chillies and then the black bean soup poured over by the waiter. Each mouthful was different with a burst of fresh coriander in one or the piquant chilli in another. Wahaca is a place where you can trust the chef (cook- sorry!) and order anything on the menu. It seemed that the less likely you are to order something (like the aforementioned soup and salad) the better it is. More standard fare like the Seasonal Vegetable Burrito (still unusual with cabbage in it!) didn't draw quite the same ecstatic response from our table. Other dishes I can't remember the name of were all of a high standard and the often earthy flavours (pipian and moles) appeal to my palette and went superbly with the beer and tequila.The Tequila tasting was also enlightening and I would say of the 3 we tried the \"reposada\" or \"rested\" tequila was my favourite being smoother for having been cask aged without the stronger sweetness of the 'Anejo'- 'Aged' variety. All were surprisingly enhanced by the flavours in the food and vice versa.I've discovered a new cuisine that I will definitely be exploring again soon. If you don't know what to order here, my advice would be- Go crazy! It's all great!",

Loved the Horchata and Agua Fresca, but loved even more the Cactus dishes last summer - please bring these back for your Summer menu! Chocolate con Churros was very good - as is the salsa and guacamole.

    "text": "Five star Mexican food and five star service! There is very little that you cannot like about this brightly coloured Mexican restaurant. Whilst the skulls are not to everyone's taste (although personally I love them and the whole dia los muetos theme), there is something on the menu for everyone and the staff are friendly and approachable (They were attentive, friendly and knew their menus. They offered recommendations and we found them laid back even though it was the lunch time weekend rush). People have a very unusual view of Mexican food, they think that it's all Taco's and Burrito's, where really this is more of a Americanisation. Mexican food is much more like street food, homemade snacks that you can buy on the street, very much in the same vein as Spanish tapas. I remember a few years back going to the Covent Garden branch of this small chain for a leaving party for one of my work friends who recommended we all go here. She herself was Mexican, loved this restaurant and wanted us to share some 'real' Mexican food (or the closest thing that she could find to her home cuisine) with us. I was under the impression at the time that this was quite an expensive place. However being a work's thing and not picking up the bill, this was probably more to do about the amount that we ordered and drunk! So visiting the Shepherd's Bush branch in Westfield's I was pleasantly shocked to see how inexpensive this restaurant actually is. The food is fantastic, and whilst you can order yourself a Burrito or main, you can also order a number of smaller dishes and sides (very much like you would if you were ordering Tapas), which allows you to sample and share a number of delightful, fresh and tasty dishes rather than having to stick to one. Burritos are about the same cost as if you went to the more fast-food orientated burrito take-away restaurants you find around London. However this experience is more appealing; you don't feel rushed and can sit back and enjoy the d\u00e9cor (skulls and all), lovely glasses which are handmade and made from recycled glass and pleasant atmosphere. I also fell in love with their Tequila selection and cocktails. They have some fantastic choices which were extremely quaffable! I tried the passion fruit margarita and the tequila mojito and could not fault either. This place has now become a frim favourite London Mexican eatery.",

So a good start.The service was so so...nothing to grumble about.The food was split into two categories...small plate....and large plates. You can order a couple of small plates and mix the type of food you get...or go for a large plate and just have that. All in all the favours were okay. I confess it was not really the flavours I would usually go for...I have eaten mexican before and have enjoyed it...but this didn't do it for me. Everyone else in the restaurant seemed to enjoy it so I guess i was the one out of place.It was surprising cheap around GDP28 for two people. So all said and done I would say give this place a try - though I make no promises.",

(You can't safely drink water in a lot of places.) Also, Mexico isn't the most vegetarian friendly country on the map.Now let's talk about what counts, the food! The street food options are delicious. The Broad Bean and Feta Taquitos and the Summer Vegetable Tacos highlight a menu with plenty of veg options. The Black Bean and Cheese Quesadillas are a great traditional option. The sides of corn and frijoles are also excellent. I would be totally remiss not to mention the Tortilla Soup which has a great warm flavor with a mild spice. Definitely a good option. If you want to try a unique drink, I recommend the Horchata (Citrus Fizz is good too) which is almond and rice milk with cinnamon. Yum! This pricing is great because you can piece your meal together at different price points depending on how hungry you are.While it is true that the service can be a bit pokey at times, I am learning that London isn't really renowned for its restaurant staff prowess. Funny how not working for a tip does that...",

    "text": "Westfield's South Terrace comprises a number of restaurants that are well-established enough to be considered a 'chain', but still small enough that the chains are mostly restricted to a handful of branches in London / the South East. For example, Balans, Fire and Stone, Del'Aziz, Kitchen Italia - and Wahaca, which has a total of three restaurants in London only. I like Westfield's policy in this respect; there is no Pizza Express, no Ask, no Zizzi - none of the ubiquitous restaurant chains that have become too big. Although Wahaca services a high number of covers, and at times can be a little pushed in that respect, the staff are highly personable and efficient, and cope very well with what is essentially the fruits of their popularity: a high turnover! Cocktails are generally good, as is the selection of good tequilas on the menu. The street food concept is something I like, and it is done very well here. It's essentially like tapas, order a handful of mini dishes and don't worry if it's not enough - you can order more later. For me this is perfect because I often don't like to commit to a main dish that may or may not be to my taste. As for puds: the chilli chocolate ice cream was a winner. I'm a fan of both chilli and chocolate, I am relatively sceptical of putting the two together, but here it works very well. The eating experience is fun: messy but delicious.",

    "text": "At last, I had some really good tacos today! And, I had them at the last place I would have thought to look - The bloody mall! Now when I hear mall food, I cringe and when I hear Mexican mall food in London...well I was not expecting much at all, but the food at Wahaca was delightfully better than my preconceived notions. The part of the menu I like is the 'Street Food' section, which is comprised of little plates where you can order a few to sample different things or share. The choices are typical: tacos, taquitos, quesadillas etc, albeit much fancier and more expensive than what you'd get off a taco cart - but the base flavors are un-mistakenly authentic.I tried a few things from the 'Street Food' menu, but I think the tacos are the best (I'll stick to these next time). They are very small and served on corn tortillas, which are true to the traditional tiny street versions but like I said before these are dressed variations and incredibly tasty! - Tacos with Pork pibil (slow cooked pork) - Wonderful flavor, they definitely use authentic spices in this marinade.- Tacos with Grilled British steak - Wow, these tender meat bites are amazing! - Tacos with Chicken in Mole - I skipped this one as I was frankly a little afraid to try it given it's hard to find a great mole even in California and once you've had the real deal you just can't settle for any 'ol mole and I really didn't feel like being subjected to that level of disappointment on this afternoon. When I looked at the menu online, they had Chicken tinga as a poultry option instead, which I'd happily jump on if it were available. Be sure to leave room for a little desert to round off your meal! Dove in for a double dose of caramel with the flan and dulce de leche ice-cream. The flan was incredibly creamy and smooth. Deserts might be the one area where British ingredients help boost the favor for these Mexican recipes because I think the milk, eggs and cream in the UK are much richer and it shows in the results of this flan and ice cream - Amazing!Note: They are quite heavy handed on raw red onions as a garnish. I'm not a fan of raw onions so if you share my dislike, be sure to let the waiter know when you order.",

Prawn ceviche tacos were delicious albeit messy, all together, this place is a steal for as close as what you can get to real \"mexican\" or american \"tex-mex\" that I've had over here. \u00a0Only down side I can see is lack of dishes with mole and can someone please offer a side of fried plantains, if not here than at a cuban/latino restuarant PLEASE... much better than chips, I miss them very much.",

That's part of the reason I don't remember half of the stuff I ate here, probably some tacos and fajitas? However, I do remember that the food was DAMN GOOD! And let me warn you, their hot sauce is HOT. SO SPICY that my cheeks were all red and I needed a ton of ice and water to cool down (and I'm usually a quite extreme spicy food eater). Two things I learned from this visit: 1. Brits don't know how to pronounce Spanish words in the cutest way!! (obviously the servers have to know...I mean they better know!) haha 2. Inauthentic Mexican food is not cheap... the prices here are pretty reasonable compared to other restaurants in central London, but anyone who has ever had REAL Mexican food would know that it should be CHEAP and GOOD! Anyhow I'm just ranting because obviously this is not a authentic Mexican restaurant... well moving on...I would definitely check out the other location if I had the chance to come back to London again! xoxo!",

    "text": "Clearly I'm obsessed with Wahaca as this is my second visit in a week. But really, it's just because I had *planned* to come to this one anyway last night, but the Sunday night visit to the Covent Garden branch was spontaneous.Anyway, while the Westfield version lacks some of the charm and excitement of the other, I'm still very happy to see it here, amongst a bunch of crap. My friend who dined with me here last night likens Westfield to the cruise ship in Wall-E and I couldn't agree more. At least Wahaca is outside!Try the hibiscus margaritas. You won't be sorry. Your wallet might.Also, the tortilla soup is awesome -- all the bulky ingredients are sitting in the bowl, which is brought to your table with a jug of the tomatoey, spicy broth that you pour over and mix in. Fun!",

    "text": "How could I have missed this place on my previous visits to Westfields? Well, from the outside it looks just as sterile and boring like all the other places, and Wahaca just doesn't mean anything to me. Boring logo, I just ignored it before. For some strange reason it really appealed today, coming from the Wood Lane end (rather than Shepherds Bush). What drew me in, though, was the sign claiming Wahaca had been voted best cheap eat by the Observer - perfect endorsement in hard times.The seats outside are either extremely low or extremely high, but once you sit down it actually has quite a nice atmosphere.I really like Mexican food, but hate tex-mex chains. This is different in just the right way. A bit like a Mexican Massala Zone with its emphasis on street/market food.We had a lovely starter, sharing a tapas portion of cactus plant on taco chips and then went for the chicken burritos. They come with tacos and a lovely home-made salsa on the side.Also, I have a thing for restaurants that offer interesting soft drinks. We had a lovely lime/mint and hibiscus/cranberry drink - a lovely alternative to diet coke or overpriced mineral water!Would have like to order a dessert, but the portions are very filling.Went for coffee instead (espresso is great for caffeine addicts like me, but the Americano almost knocked my less addicted boyfriend off his seat - luckily we were on the low recliners rather than bar stools!). The chilli chocolate on the side was a very nice touch.And what we first thought were matches, turned out to be little seed sticks to grow your own chillis at home.A new favourite!",

I've been taken through the menu here by a few people in the know - it fully knocked my socks off. I'm normally an adventurous type and will go for the things I haven't heard of before - if you're not, do make an effort to do so here. It's the stuff you wouldn't normally order that shines out. The chocolatey mole, the fish tacos, the black bean soup... well, you can see plenty of others waxing lyrical on the topic down below my writings. But, you know, even if you're not feeling adventurous, something like the sharing selection for two is comprehensive and equally tasty and good quality. I was there when the top deck was closed off for the night - I went up to take in the view and couldn't help but enjoy watching everyone downstairs clattering and chattering, and mostly getting overexcited about their plastic spoons.",

    "text": "Before going on an extended vacation to England with my sis, I researched Mexican food joints for us to check out. This place seemed to have promise. I came here under the illusion that I'd be eating Mexican style \"street food\" and I was gravely mistaken. Being from LA, I've had my fair share of Mexican cuisine but not even the worst places I've visited can compare to my experience at Wahaca. The name itself should have clued me in (being an anglicized version of Oaxaca). \u00a0I recall having a quesadilla while my sister had a burrito of some sort. They were both horrible. Just overall atrocious. Both meals lacked in the flavor department and contained some very unorthodox ingredients (which did not help their cause in the least). I believe the salsa wasn't any good either. How difficult can it be to make a descent taco? Even Santa Barbara has some pretty great food which is saying a lot considering the demographic.I suppose if you haven't eaten authentic Mexican food, you can't compare the two and therefore know just how bad the imitation is. If you haven't tried genuine Mexican food than this may be your cup of tea but, you're missing out.Needless to say, on my last venture to Mexico, a \"street\" taco cost me $5 (in Mexican pesos which is equivalent to less than 50 American cents) and it was actually good. The Pros: The ambiance had some character and our waiter was very friendly and not at all bad to look at.",

    "text": "I usually judge Mexican food by the salsa, the guacamole, the street tacos, the quesadillas and the margaritas. My night of tasting the delights here met my approval for having the best Mex this side of the Atlantic. My cravings finally have a place to go to be filled (cuz God help me I'm American and need my south of the border fix on a regular basis). The guacamole had great flavor and had nice chunks of avocado. This is a huge plus for me since I could eat this stuff with a spoon and forget the crisps. I went through two bowls of salsa verde. Some people use sauces to cover up foods. There was nothing wrong with the food... I has a second helping just so I could dunk soft tortillas in it to lap up its goodness. The quesadillas...oh good golly... the crazy mushroom quesadilla that was creamy and gooey and unpronounceable. It's a fungus that grows on corn. Seriously. Can I just say it's the best damn fungus I've ever tried because I will be back for more. Then, the pork tacos. Three small soft corn tortillas, fresh and dripping with oil, filled with a saucy pulled pork and covered in pickled veg were spot on. They were a bit fancier than the normal street taco that I'm used to, but they were great little starter bites -- again, dunked into that super salsa verde. While I didnt test a margarita there, I did try the blanco, reposado and anejo Corralejo tequilas in the Wahaca designed tumblers. Nice touch. I sampled so many delicious dinner items, and finished off with some heavenly decadent churros, that I would like to go back for a repeat of a few things and then continue sampling the other items on the menu. I dont think that anything would disappoint me since my basic needs have been met. Besides, I totally bought into the locally sourced, Mexican inspired menu. I love a restaurant with a conscience and passion for great tasting, sustainable food. ...This location would also be great for sunny days. Lots of outdoor seating and the front of the restaurant opens up completely. Cant wait to head there in the summer for quacamole and a cold cerveza!",

Some friends and I tried to get into the one at South Bank the other night but there was a 90-minute wait for a table, so I knew I had to pop in another time. When I found it at Westfield in Shepherds Bush, I had to jump in. I've ordered a sweet potato side, slow-cooked pork burrito and the Tequila Experience. Sweet potato - I don't know what they've done to it but I've never had anything like it. Crispy on the outside and so smooth and sweet in the middle. Perfection. I've made the mistake in the past of eating traditional Mexican before and adding cheese to the burrito. I learnt my lesson that time. The pork is so tender. It falls apart in your mouth. Jesus would say \"Fuck you, Judas, I'm hanging around,\" if this were served at the Last Supper. And the tequila! I've only had two of the three but they are so smooth, babies' arses everywhere are jealous. Looking forward to the last. This is a must-do if you like food and you're in London. I will be returning again before I leave.",

I met with a friend for lunch and settled on some Mexican, and I can say that I was very satisfied with that decision. Service was excellent. They took great care of us making sure our drinks were always full and that the food was to our satisfaction. They left nothing to be desired on this one. Drinks, we had different Margaritas and shared. I loved mine, she loved hers, we didn't like each others'....inconclusive! lol.The food was good. The British Steak taco was flavorful, the pork pibil taco (like BBQ pulled pork), was so-so. I then ordered the jazzed up Green rice and the Frijoles (refried beans and chorizo sausage) which are two different side dishes but were made for each other. Rice and beans are a quintessential dish and I wasn't about to miss out! I don't know why they don't sell those two together, because they are awesome combined! A couple of margaritas and there must have been some other food ordered but I'm ashamed to say that I they weren't memorable enough apparently. If you need a Mexican fix in London, the mall is legit. TIP: The only thing that I would have done differently is that they have on the menu a 2 person platter for \u00a320 with a lot of food. Next time I'll get that instead of buying everything piecemeal, my wallet would have preferred that.",

The ceviche was pretty good but not out of this world.For a very affordable and convenient meal with friendly service, I recommend this place.

I wasn't expecting too much since the other \"Mexican\" food I've had in London has been some awful, flavourless rendition of the stuff you can find in any tiny taqueria in LA. Well, damn, I got my fix. I went for it, and basically ordered everything I could off the \"tapas\" part of the menu. I really wanted taquitos. So I ordered those, tostadas, tacos and a burrito. I ordered everything vegan, and I was really surprised at all the flavours!Tacos: really tasty, didn't need extras.Taquitos: shell kind of too thick, but the flavours were great.Tostada: very fresh, in-season vegetablesBurrito: Only had a tiny taste, as it was for my boyfriend. Really tasty, and the best one I've had in London, so far. (It's really hard to get a decent burrito here!)I can't really give a review for the meat products... before I went veg, I'd had my fair share of meaty Mexican food, so I do wonder how flavourful and authentic it is in that respect.Overall, as a veg, I give it a thumbs up. I won't say it's authentic (authentic usually means it has lard), but it's really satisfying and tasty. The only thing I didn't like was that the guacamole seemed kinda watery and weird. I love a good, chunky, creamy guac, but it didn't taste horrible.I came to this location in the day time during lunch, and there was hardly anyone in there... but it quickly filled up in the time I consumed my meal. They don't allow you to book a table, but I think it's worth it, if you want a great burrito/taco in London.",

Now we Brits haven't been exposed to half decent Mexican food on this kind of scale before, so I can see how it seems easy for the Brits to get a bit carried away with Wahaca sometimes.Tasty food, burrito was good but why do I have to pay extra for cheese? Seems to me this is a staple thing, but hey ho. I'm a sucker for melted cheese and so I was probably going to be happy with anything that came in a folded flour tortilla and I wasn't disappointed.The prices are low, which I guess is probably the best thing about the place. The hibiscus drink was pretty nice too.Our server was a little surly. And did the old trick of forcing tap water on a colleague of mine. Naughty waiter. He wasn't the best server and I felt pretty disgruntled about the added service charge when there was only 5 of us. Dude - you're getting your tip, so, at least try and be nice to us! Overall this is canteen food and everything about the place from the seating to the Wagamama-style paper menus was designed to get us in and out of the place quickly. If the prices had been higher this place would've got a lot less stars. As it is, you get what you pay for. Done.",

    "text": "Full disclosure: if the prices were a little lower, this would be four stars. To begin, is anyone actually expecting authentic mexican street food here? Really? Go here expecting some mexican-inspired food and I think you'll be pleased. We had some delicious and very crunchy tortilla chips with so-so guacamole, my fianc\u00e9e had an absolutely first-rate cheese-and-mushroom melt thing (queso fundido) and pork tacos, and I had a vegetable burrito. She said her tacos were delicious. As for the burrito, it was great - and again, nothing like what you'd find on a mexican street corner. There was squash and feta cheese in it, for heaven's sake. It was absolutely tasty and I could eat another one right now, but authentic? Psssssh.We didn't go in expecting authentic food and were pleased with what we got. I absolutely recommend that you do the same, should you find yourself in the area of the Westfield mall and craving something... mexican-esque. Oh, and props to our waiter - he was quick and attentive, and brought us a refill on our chips right on time. Nice!",

    "text": "I've been to Wahaca a few times (well, this was the third...) and always this branch. Whilst meaning to try one of the other ones I always seem to just end up at the Westfield branch, and so far I haven't been too disappointed. A massive fan of sharing plates and the tapas style approach (probably stemming from the fact I can never make up my mind what to have, so having some of everything works in my favour) we had dishes of the street food - some tacos - pork pibil and chicken tinga, MSC ceviche tostada, chorizo and potato quesadilla and one of their new specials - the Huarache (or slipper!). We also had some spicy slaw on the side. I love their pork pibil, I've had that as one of the bigger mains (they do those as well as the street food dishes and it was good), so I enjoyed that. The chicken was alright but nothing special. I'm not a fan of seafood so didn't really enjoy the ceviche tostada (scallops and prawns) but that's not their fault! The quesadilla was fantastic, as was the Huarache and slaw. However overall the bread/wraps they used just didn't taste right, but I'm not exactly sure why, just a bit tasteless. Drinks were good and my tequila chocolate toddy shot to conclude the meal was heart warming and had a great alcohol hit to it. Incredible. However service was a bit worse than usual, taking ages for the dishes to arrive, even though they were all piling up on the pass. And to get the bill took a while - noone seemed to be looking at us even though we were trying to get their attention! Ah well. I've liked it before but this visit was under par, but I'll go again, and rather tempted to try one of the other locations out as well to see if there's a difference.",

    "text": "I've wandered past Wahaca often, and always be vaguely intrigued...plus the boy has always assured me that the food is delicious. We finally got around to making a trip on Saturday, and it left me with slightly mixed sentiments. Some of the food is, indeed, delicious. The chorizo and potato quesadillos, the pork pibil and the MSC ceviche were gorgeous - beautifully spiced, lovely flavours and all very more-ish. We also tried the Huarache (black beans, salsa, feta...), which was very pleasant, and the chicken tinga tacos (lovely chicken, not keen on the sauce). To be honest, the main disapointment of the food was the tortillas themselves, which didn't quite manage either a taste or a texture that enthralled me. But that can be over-looked, given the tasty fillings. For once, I decided to have a dessert too. Now that was a disappointment. I like churros - I've had them in Spain a few times - and they've always been tasty and surprisingly un-greasy...well, not here. The oiliness and lack of flavour of the churros made me regret ordering a dessert at all, even though the chocolate sauce was lovely and the boy's chill choclate tequilla toddy was quite surprisingly yummy. So the dessert disappointed. But there was another reason why I couldn't push my score up; the service. Now, I have to say that the staff were all delightfully friendly, polite and willing to help and make suggestions. It's just getting them to pay attention that's a little hard. In fairness to them, they have a lot of tables to look after and it was busy, but when you have to sit holding your empty glass desperatley trying to catch someone's eye as they walk past you not once, not twice, not even just three times...well, it's not the best of situations. Still, whilst I may not decide to go back there myself, I would certainley not turn it down as a suggestion. And there are a few things I wouldn't mind trying next time I visit...",

I recently tried the Soho branch and enjoyed the experience so much that when my friend suggested the Westfield branch the other day, I readily agreed. This time we went for the sharing platter of 5 dishes - the pok pilbil tacos, seasonal vegetarian tacos, corn quitlacoche quesadillas and chicken taqitos and black bean tostadas - all for \u00a319.95.This was a pretty decent spread for the price - truth be told we probably didn't even need that much food. Their own made soft drinks are lovely; my friend waxed lyrical over the almond and rice milk iced drink with cinnamon, while I liked the sweet and fresh hibiscus water made with cranberry both for \u00a31.40.Lovely food, messy, authentic, friendly and colourful.",

I went with a friend, and my opinion is a bit mixed. The service was quite nice and our food came out immediately, but to me honest food coming out in about 5 minutes makes me a bit concerned about the quality of the food, how long it's been sitting there, etc. I liked what I had ordered, I believe it was a Potato Taquito and a shrimp ceviche, in fact I really loved the ceviche, which had a nice fresh flavor. However, my friend couldn't finish his food because he disliked it so much. I had a bite of his chicken taco, and he was right, it was quite bland. I didn't dare try his British steak taco (of course, why buy English food where the specialty is Mexican, but I digress...), but I trusted his judgment. I can't give Wahaca more than a 3, considering my friend (a real meat lover) hated his meal, yet I quite liked mine. I'd like to go one more time though to sample a few more and really get a feel of it :]",

I do have to say the location is pretty great, being right at westfield mall but the noise level inside the restaurant was way too much for me, I could barely hear my dad across the table from me.I did not find the food to be authentic or spicey in the slightest. There was some flavor but nothing like what I am used to. One thing that really threw me was that the nachos have melted liquid cheese on them? Nachos are supposed to have melted shredded cheese on them, ours were soggy and pretty bland. Upon paying we waited for nearly 10 minutes for some change which we thought rather odd, no one in the restaurant had a 5? Overall it was okay food at a good location.",

Favourites include quesadilla (both mushroom and the famous chorizo and potato are great) the taquitos, crispy tortilla rolls filled with lovely fillings, topped with salad, sour cream, cheese and tomato. Infact, many things here are served with a little pile of salad, which makes me very happy! We also tried the fish tacos between us, lovely, fresh salad and crispy fish, served with a surprisingly flavourful rice and beans. I would say that the small plates, tapas style, are better than the large plates, they are better value for money, tastier and showcase a wider range of flavours. Dessert was a shot of chocolate, which is different to the usual hot chocolate, closer to proper drinking chocolate, chocolate cake, which was abit boring and........churros! Now shoot me down for saying this but I've never had churros before and I have to say, this place has ruined me for churros for the rest of my life because they were awesome; crispy, crunchy, soft in the middle, slightly fatty tasting, in the best possible way and served with caramel dipping sauce......totally yummy!We also enjoyed some nice cocktails; Hibiscus margarita and Hibiscus Mojito but the menu showcases quite afew interesting options, soft drinks sounded nice too. All in all, an enjoyable meal, food is served very quickly, is fresh and moreish and good value, this places gets busy though so go super early!",

As someone who has eaten a lot of Mexican food in both the US and in Mexico, this is neither authentic Mexican, Tex-Mex nor anything in between. Also: Oaxaca. Don't treat your audience as idiots.Now that that's out of the way, I can review this place for the general tastiness of food and such. Decent enough dinner, if a bit tiny. They say that the \"street food\" dishes are designed to be shared tapas style. This would work if they weren't so measly. For the most part, however, they tasted alright. Our server was a touch slow, but very responsive and friendly. The best part of the meal was the churros. Fresh, cinnamony, and with a nice chocolate sauce Still. Not Mexican.

    "text": "I ordered the Beef Burrito and was disappointed with the actual amount of beef in it. Just a few strips and the rest was filling (rice, beans, cabbage, green rice, etc.).The ambiance was nice, but not Mexican at all. The music selection was mostly Salsa and Cumbia. Not very Mexican.To me, this was more of a Tex-Mex restaurant, but the flavor was not what you'd find in Texas or Mexico. There are other dishes on the menu that sound appetizing but I'm not sure I'd return to try them.Then again, the restaurant was pretty packed so they must be doing something right.",

I know my tacos being from Southern California, The pork pibil tacos have great flavour and though they are a bit on the small side theres a small price attached to them. \u00a34 for 3 mini tacos. This may not be proper street style, but i think the flavours are there and they are delicious. I love the tequila options and the fact that they have jamaica and horchata. SO good! I eat here when I start to miss mexican food.",

    "text": "If you have ever had Mexican food prepared by Mexicans in a restaurant owned by Mexicans, or anything even close, you will be disappointed by Wahaca. As the spelling of Oaxaca suggests, this is \"Mexican\" food for people who have no idea what Mexican food actually is. It is very creamy and tastes almost Italian influenced. The chips were cardboard covered in sour cream. The \"avocado salsa\" in my burrito contained zero avocado. Do the chefs ever see fresh tomatillo? Probably not. To be fair, I shouldn't have expected so much coming from Los Angeles to a place that has very very few Latinos. Stars for a clean, friendly and well-managed chain. The quality of the ingredients were fine, just definitely NOT authentic Mexican. I would honestly rather go to Chipotle.",

    "text": "Decent enough Mexican-inspired food without blowing my socks off - a nice enough location with friendly staff. I enjoyed some things more than others; highs and lows really emphasising the average star rating I have given with this review.I want to emphasise the Mexican street food INSPIRED nature of the food on offer; I don't think anything there would be welcomed as authentic by Mexicans or true fans of their food, but that doesn't mean parts weren't tasty. I just think describing dishes as \"truly authentic\" Mexican then throwing in feta, or Lancashire cheddar, is a bit of a mixed message.My favourite dishes were the spicy pork tacos, the queso fundido (which wasn't so much cheese fondue as a cheese-sauce-topping for some cactus leaves, but was delicious anyway) and their \"citrus fizz\" drink (basically a non-alcoholic mojito). I was extremely disappointed however with their chicken taquitos. Described as \"tender, marinated chicken\" it was actually rock hard, burnt and tasteless chicken owing in part to the deep frying. It may well have been tender and marinated before it went in the fryer, but it was completely ruined. My wife and I went tapas style, grabbing a load of smaller plates to share - however we couldn't share the pork tacos as they came with beans (not advertised) and my wife hates them. So that too was disappointing.All in all, if someone wanted to come here again with me, I wouldn't be against the idea - however there are many, many better options so I doubt I will be returning to Wahaca (the spelling of this name really bothers me) on my own accord.",
