When my friends go to England and ask what they should do, they are always surprised when I say \u00a0\"go to this falafel spot \"Taza\" on Queensway\". Come on people, you can see a clock, old church or big ferris wheel anywhere. but amazing, cheap and unique* food is truly hard to find. Taza is what Robert Langdon was really looking for.*do they still hot press the sandwiches? Ive haven't seen that mentioned in any reviews.A close second to this place is my local spot in New York called \"mamouns\" and I only speak for the original on Macdougal St. So if your in NYC hit me up and you can buy me one. $3.50",

    "text": "'Taza' is a popular outlet on Queensway. I had walked past a few times over the years but had never gone in because of the large queue of people trailing outside of the shop.Once inside I was surprised at such a small menu. They have Lamb & Chicken Shawarma upright spits and some other vegetarian dishes of Falafel, (but no chips!) Vegetarian Curry and a range of fresh juices.I opted for the Mixed Shawarma and was presented with a large open oval pita with a basic choice of salad and there were chilli & garlic sauces on the counter to which I could help myself!The chicken was fresh, juicy and nicely marinated.The lamb is of a similar good standard though I would put it slightly below 'Best Mangal' or 'Woody Grill' in terms of overall quality & taste.The salad was fresh and more varied than in usual Lebanese shawarma joints.The garlic sauce was fine.The chilli sauce was a mild one but was good and being able to serve myself I put a large amount on to up the spicy heat!The bread was OK but a little soggy - mainly because I put so much hot sauce inside.The service was brusque even on a quiet evening but I put that down to their usual manner of dealing with a crowded house.The mixed shawarma cost \u00a34.A single of either meat in pita will set you back \u00a33.50 and if you want it with rice it is \u00a34.It must be said the prices have stayed the same since I first tried their food in 2009 BUT the portions have gotten noticeably smaller.In conclusion, 'Taza' is worthy of its popularity and the high turnover ensures a quality product at a good price.RECOMMENDED!",

We returned and had dinner on a subsequent night, where I had a lamb shawarma, my brother a falafel, and my mother a chicken shawarma, all matching the initial in taste and texture and value. Should I return to London, I know a return to Taza will be inevitable.",

Simpy put, one of the best shawarmas I've eaten to date. After that first sando, I returned daily for the next 4 days and each time was great.And then the 5th visit was so horrific, it completely tainted the previous amazing shawarmas. The lamb was this funky, gristle-laiden mess with a very rotten taste. Curiously enough it was the one visit w/o a queue so apparently everyone else had gotten the memo but me.",

Taza has a great white sauce that matches wonderfully with it's rice and meat. My roommates are currently eating a shawarma right now, and I'm getting cravings. It smells delicious, tastes great! I have no complaints about the friendly staff, lovely food and nice prices. The workers are friendly, ready to help you out and always up for a chat.

Got everything on it and all the flavors combined wonderfully. Also, the line was out the door and checking the reviews here beforehand made me realize quite quickly that I was in for a real treat. I took it to go & devoured it in the comfort of my hotel room. The whole thing may feel small (especially for Americans), but it was the perfect size for me.

I had a chicken shawarma with everything on it and couple \"pieces\" of falafel. I'd recommend knowing what you want as I felt like I was in a Seinfeld episode with the ordering queue. The guy running the spit was as unfriendly as they come - I got him out of sorts by apparently asking for a non-standard order. Fortunately I still got my \"soup\" and wasn't asked to \"come back... 1 year\". The guy running the register was very friendly though and helped out this Yankee tourist.I'll definitely make an effort to go eat there again if I'm ever back in the area.",

A small shop with not enough space if I'm being honest. Haven't sold out to corporate chain. Check.4. Open windows onto street offer whaft of amazing smells from the 2 rotating spits.
