However, the Curzon Soho is the only cinema in the West End that screens a lot of the important foreign films. For that reason alone, it is worth a visit. The screens are bigger than in most chain cinemas and at least you don't have to spend \u00a315 on a ticket. Watch out, though. For the best new films, this place often gets sold out. Also, there is not enough space inside to queue so people often end up waiting outside. Not a good idea in January.",

The bars are always full and people come just to enjoy the atmosphere and have a coffee. The variety of films being shown is very wide and they cover the categories I enjoy most-independent, art house, foreign, etc. The pricing is expensive, but going to the cinema is pricy everywhere. Located in SOHO, so it is a perfect place to go before a night or as the first portion of a date. The individual screening rooms are nice, not too big. Reminds me of older theaters that are more personal. I really like The Curzon Soho, and intend to go back as many times as I can afford! Student tickets are a bit cheaper.",

The cinema was decorated with posters of the band leading down the staircase- it really felt like much more of an 'event' than just going to the pictures. The feeling I get from this cinema is that it seems to really celebrate film rather than just see it as a business. The venue has a cafe and bar and the fact that you can bring a drink into the cinema itself I think is just fantastic for relaxing after work. Consequently it has a much more grown up feel and I probably wouldn't recommend it to families/children.",

He loves it because of their selection of art house films and special events. I love it because the films they choose are, for the large part, still accessible enough for me to tag along and not feel like a complete moron. I'd also recommend this place as a nice bar and somewhere great to meet up with friends. There drinks selection can be a bit pricey (though members get a discount) but it's worth it for the buzz of the place and the comfy sofa's. If you're into cakes (and I am) then you'll find the display by Konditor and Cook irresistible. I think my favourites are the tiny jam sponges with rude words iced across the top- fun to laugh at and fun to eat! Touches like this make you feel like The Curzon still has a sense of humour and while it deliberately avoids the mainstream it's not too cool for school.",

As well as the fact that it is a cinema which shows a range of art house, independent and British films, it has 3 floors of coffee shops and bars.I came here on Friday night with some friends; we were looking for a night cap but fancied caffeine, rather than alcoholic stimuli. We headed for the ground floor coffee bar (the floors work downwards), and had to wait for a table for a bit as this place gets pretty full. The cakes in this bit are by Konditor and Cook, and are yummy. My friend had a raspberry meringue, which was every bit as sweet and gooey as you would expect. Also look out for the chocolate brownie if you come here. The lattes were very good quality, but the server could have perhaps been a bit less...sniffy. When my friend asked if one latte could have a shot of caramel in it, he replied 'darling, you are not in a Caffe Nero!'. Alrighty then; I will just keep my coffee simple then!",

I didn't read the instructions properly so missed out on the band, Creme Brulee, fronted by Jeremy Dyson (of league of gents fame). He had selected most of the movies (except one) and gave an introduction/read from a story he'd written that was a bit creepy but available online from the grauniad. Lots of people made the effort to dress up, there was face painting and a free cocktail. The League of Gents xmas special worked brilliantly on the big screen, then there was I walked with a Zombie, which is the most beautifully shot B movie ever. After that a Peter Wyngarde movie for all the Jason King fans, Peter looked practically hairless, no moustache, it was disorienting at that time in the morning (about 2am). Basically he found out his wife was a witch and got really cross because guess what he was a humanist teacher who taught there was no such thing as witches ha ha. NIght of the eagles I think it was called (american title Burn the Witch or something similar) Then the real treat of the Night (after very strong complimentary coffee and loo visit to the poster loo) The Believers by John Schlesinger starring Martin Sheen. Absolutely brilliant. I recommend it if it's on dvd. A little bit racist but I can see the influences in the league of gentlemen. All about child sacrifice and secret cults. Very pertinent to these times where dozens of children in africa are murdered every year, accused of being witches (I mean come on) Finally, the one not picked by JD, Scream Blacula Scream, a rather elegiac B Movie, no nudity unfortunately, and some truely awful vampire makeup. Then it was about 8am, we got our pastries and coffee and headed out into the chill of Shaftesbury avenue. The seats are great, has to be said, I don't think you could have done it in another venue, and I was just near enough to the front for the sound to keep blasting me awake.",

Ticket prices range from 8 pound upwards depending on the feature but look out in the press for special offers and membership. One of the highlights for the Curzon is the London gay and Lesbian Film festival that hold many of there showing at the venue.

Because I am a total sucker for movies and even more so for movie theatres, and because the Curzon is my favourite cinema in London. They have a fabulous selection of films, the staff here seem to know what they are talking about, and the cinema has a very cosy and intimate feel to it, so I always feel a little special when I come here. What's more, they also have a wonderful little caf\u00e9 and a bar, and you even get to bring your drinks into the movie theatre - how cool is that? Also, the location is at once very convenient, making it easy to meet here after work, and to get back home afterwards, and at the same time makes this almost a hidden jewel, as you wouldn't expect such a charming and high-quality cinema in the middle of the hustle-and-bustle and commercialism that is Soho.Granted, the prices are not cheap (so, sadly, I hardly ever come here), but when I do allow myself the luxury I always thoroughly enjoy it.",

Later, I dream to be Toto (Cinema Paradiso), operating Laurel and Hardy (the 35mm projectors) like I used to do at MIT Lecture Series Committee. Bringing other people's stories and dreams closer to you. \u00a0Moments of boxing day blues... my eyes are delighted by the Curzon email :-) Not a cineaste yet... I was drawn to a few art-house movies and Q&As with the directors and actors (Christian Carion on L'Affaire...). The manager of the Q&A is attentive, \u00a0giving good cues and engaging us in a good sense of humour. It is a typical London cinema i.e. a social experience, yet with its own flavour. \u00a0Curzon Soho's full window embraces the sunlight, when you can sit on high chairs sipping your coffee and whisky for hours. \u00a0We shared a few paragraphs of reading (lines from Omega Minor and references on Wagner). Downstairs has more cozy sofa with wifi and 3 different screens for movies. A low key yet embracing experience in London to have for 2nd/3rd time visitors. Many thanks to NG's initial introduction.",

Its central location means that it can get quite busy, but also makes it all the more exciting.There is something really nice about stepping off the busy streets of central London, and escaping into the quite zone of a cinema. In true Soho style, Curzon is trendy, comfortable and has a general high quality. There is a nice bar upstairs and another downstairs. The selection of films is always really good, and there is usually quite a few European films showing. If you plan on going quite a bit, you can get a membership for 40 pounds a year, which gets you discounted prices for you and a friend, as well as the Curzon magazine delivered to your door.",

Pret-a-Portea at The Berkeley eat your heart out.OK back to the cinema...Staff are pretty cool, the downstairs bar is nice, films are good, they sell a good selection of DVDs. Ah whatever, the cake-dress thing wins it.",

On the ground floor there is a cafe that belongs to the Konditor and Cook chain, as consequently sells coffees, teas, and lovely cakes. It is often busy, but a great place to pop in for a quick break, or to get out of the rain. On the floor below is another cafe and bar which is open for as long as the cinema. It is a good place to while away a day reading a book, hanging out with friends, or, if you are seeing a film, get a drink pre or post. The cinema itself has three screens and shows general release arts films, as well as one of screenings, talks and recently a midnight movies series.",

    "text": "After attending a bevy of Curzon's Midnight Movies series, I think that this place has come to be my fave Kino in London. It just seems to tick all the boxes. Just to prove this, without the boxes - here is a list of things that I would tick were there boxes available.- Great roster of new films - always current, always adventurous.- A sense of history. This place puts on some top notch retrospectives and often gets the director (when alive) to talk beforehand.- Crazy ideas. As mentioned before, Midnight Movies is a perfect example. Last time I was dressed in gruesome attire for their halloween bonanza. it was great. I woke up the next morning with a green pillow thanks to my makeup.- Nice bar. The bar is nice - it serves Vedett beer. It has comfy sofas. It is big. Which is very nice.- Lovely cafe above. Konditor and Cook is ace - it does ace cakes and sandwiches.- Good DJs and music before and after the show. You get a bit more for your money - not just stale popcorn.- Perfect location. On the edge of Soho means it's easy to get to, great to go out from afterwards, and good for an impromptu cinema trip in the afternoon.Other than that, it's lovely to be able to go somewhere where the staff know what they're talking about, and people have a real passion for films. The Curzon is also a key player in London's cinema culture. When there's something special on in London, Curzon is invariably involved, and most indie, leftfield and small budget releases get their feet wet at the Curzon.Mostly though, it's the atmosphere of the place - it makes you want to go watch films all the time. Which is good.I might even become a member i like it that much, which means that I get nice freebies.SO, it shall be deemed worthy of the five star accolade that I just gave it. Hurrah.",

It has an array of independent film videos for sale next to the awesome cafe. The cafe offers a full range of coffee, tea, beer, wine and spirits. It's what embodies what every cinema should be like in my opinion.",

It is a good meeting point for a drink as they have a good bar downstair and coffee and cakes upstair. Nice seating area both downstair and upper floor. Sometime you could find a preview film party at the basement. A total of three n screen at this cinema. I like the largest one with decent seats and sound system. Best things is you have a choice to sit anywhere you like. Latest film I watched there is \"son of saul\", foreigners best awards film. The amazing sound system make your heart beat hard. Although there is a fault fire alarm happened that night, but they managed to continue the film afterwards. \u00a0This cinema is like my second home cause I'm a movie person especially i enjoyed watxhing foreign movies and arty movies. And curzon \u00a0soho fulfilled my needs.",

    "text": "I love this cinema, seriously one of my favourite places; a true London treasure.Always showing the most interesting and well crafted movies from around the world in cute screens with plush velvet seats. Don't miss out on the MASSIVE cakes from the top floor cafe, or the wide range of tasty wines and beers from the lower floor bar. Both of these areas also have their own comfy seating areas so you can relax before or after your film. You can also be pretty sure that you won't have loudmouth kids ruining your movie experience, as this cinema tends to attract the more respectful, grown up customer there to enjoy the amazing films on offer. Step away from Leicester Square and take a chance on the Curzon, you won't be disappointed. Then maybe like me become a member and enjoy 15% off, oh yeah!

Not only are the screens intimate and the special Q&A's with directors and actors are \u00a0so frequently great. Not only that but the bar area serves good coffee and drinks with a great view of passing London life out the window. It's a true gem of Soho.",

    "text": "We often seem to end up in the Soho Curzon whenever we are in London. It's a great place to chill out for a couple of hours and catch an original art house film. Tickets are a very reasonable \u00a38 each if you go off peak (ie the afternoon), making it cheaper than the Duke of York in Brighton. The film selection is also great, a little different from your run-of-the-mill chain cinemas, with movies often being successful at numerous foreign film festivals. There are three screens here, all of them quite small, but the seats are comfortable and the view is always good. You can buy alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages from the bar and take them in to the movie with you.Upstairs there is a lovely cafe with comfortable sofa's to relax on before the movie starts, and free wifi is available. On the top floor by the entrance, there is also a Konditor and Cook, where we usually grab a hot drink and cake on arrivalThe staff are also friendly and helpful, and this is generally a nice place to hang out in London.",

While they don't specify in just foreign or art house films, if there is something a little far fetched you fancy seeing, the Curzon is probably your best bet. \u00a0 They curate a great selection of films from around the world, along with a couple Hollywood films - though lean more towards the quirky or Indie side for those picks - and at a much better price than the ones just a couple streets over in Leicester Sq. \u00a0 The Curzon plays host to a Konditor and Cooke cafe too, so you can load up on their yummy curlywurly cake or fudgepacker brownies before setting in for a good film.",

Big spacious sofas/couches, very pretty pattern on my mocha coffee, good place to hang out with a big group of friends and no pressure for you to see a movie or anything.Every time I walk past, I see that the movies they show are more alternative/indie ones rather than the big blockbuster movies.One more thing to comment on, the cafe on the ground floor, Konditor & Cook, is always packed. My boss bought a cake from here once, it was big, and it was lovely. Not touted as \"high class\" bakeries like Valeries or Pauls but a good local bakery nonetheless!",

Alternative films shown in an upmarket location for those of us who yearn to live in NYC circa 1970s, in a loft, with Woody Allen next door. Be cool, grow your beard (oh you already have) and get down to Curzon Soho and enjoy a great film. Get your beverage and snacking sorted before you enter as like any other cinema the popcorn and fizzy drinks on offer before you enter the screens are embarrassingly overpriced and without any imagination.",

It goes without saying that you can take your food and drink into the theatre to enjoy while watching a movie. \u00a0And if you are still hungry afterwards, you can cross the street and you're in Chinatown!The movies are expensive, but you can buy a yearly membership valid throughout the Curzon group of theatres, which includes the Renoir. \u00a0This membership includes a discount for you and a guest each time you attend, so you can earn your money back if you attend enough movies, which given the pleasurable experience, it's not difficult to do!",
