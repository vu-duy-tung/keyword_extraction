This has radically changed, and it's now a sophisticated 'hotel bar' style cocktail lounge with low lighting and decorative windows that have been beautifully restored.Those windows look out on to the station concourse, where you can view the famous kissing couple statue as well as Eurostars and their passengers coming and going.There is an excellent selection of (pricey) wine here, and staff will be more than happy to top up your glass as you enjoy a drink. Cocktails are, I'm told, very good too. Just don't order too many!",

The wine was also delicious and I've been told the gin martinis are spot on. All in all I had a wonderful evening but I do feel it's over-priced.",

    "text": "Great location, service and ambiance!My friend and I stopped in to the historic Booking Office restaurant at the absolutely stunning St Pancras Renaissance London Hotel. Seriously this hotel is amazing with soo much history and attention to detail, but that is for another review...The restaurant in bar is set in the back of the hotel with direct access to St Pancras station. Being inside the station and with direct access to Kings Cross station brings in an eclectic crowd. It was fun to people watch and see people coming in from Brussels or Paris.The bar and restaurant is set in a Victorian feel with low light - making the feel inviting yet cozy. A mix of small and large tables and benches fill the room. A large bar wraps around one side of the restaurant - which I was told was actually the old booking office for the station way back when (hence the name). You can even see the old booking office windows behind the bar. The restaurant offers an array of cocktails, wine, champagne and beer. The menu is not extensive, but there is something for everyone. I enjoyed the mushroom butternut squash risotto. The dish was presented well and was light yet filling. To top off the night I enjoyed the Chocolate fondant cake with vanilla ice cream. The sponge cake was filled hot chocolate amazingness! I would highly recommend.All in all - if you are looking for a quick stop for a drink or dinner at the station this is definitely the place to be!",

    "text": "Just to let you all know that this is the most costly place I have ever been in.Here is my story.I knew it would be expensive, but I had to visit as it is a bar selling real ale.I asked at one end of the bar, the price of a half pint of real ale, can't remember the name but it was only 4.1. The young lady behind the bar didn't know, but went to ask a colleague. She came back with \u00a33.60, for a half pint!! But I had to have one so I could report. I had to go to the other end of the bar to order it and the price had gone up to \u00a33.94. I queried the difference and was told that the other person had got it wrong. I told them that I would report it on web sites, but as he wasn't wasn't the manager, it seemed he didn't care. I did ask the manager and was told that there is a 12% service charge. What sevice? I went to the bar my self and got the drink. I will not be going in there again, but maybe they don't want real ale drinkers, just tourists who will pay over the odds. I wish there was a minus star, because I would give minus 2, it would be lower, but it is a very smart place.On another note, I hope Meantime Brewery are getting a bigger payment for their ales.And that is the end of my taleThank you for reading.",

Would be a good venue for a date, or to take some out-of-towners. I love the gothic spires, wooden accents, arched windows and artful interior lighting. Drinks: \u00a0Cocktails slightly pricey at \u00a312 each, and to be honest, tasted good but none of \u00a0the mixes were anything brilliant. \u00a0(note: I haven't had any of the warm drinks mentioned in another review, which might be superior).Service: \u00a0Slow with attitude. Yawn. Why am I paying for people who don't seem to care at all about serving? I had to get up twice to get hold of my waiter; once I went to the bar myself to order drinks as I couldn't find anyone to serve me. And even after I'd ordered it took a while to get the drinks on, which seemed odd as the bar appeared to be well staffed. Food: Absolutely amazing, very impressed. \u00a0The sea bream tasted so fresh it must have been swimming that morning. The halibut looked stunning; visual presentation of all dishes was excellent (4 of us went for dinner), and the portions were well sized. \u00a320 for a main is money well spent here. Visually the place is fabulous, and the location is super convenient. But that doesn't make up for bad service.",

    "text": "First the positives: The atmosphere here is great and the staff are lovely - the right level of attentiveness without being over bearing. However, the reason for only two stars is this:the breakfast menu stops at 11am on a saturday, with no brunch type options on the menu. This is a shame as they have 4 sandwich options and I'm sure a breakfast-type one wouldn't be too difficult to add. I tried to order the \"daily special\" (though they are listed, by day, on the menu) and was merely told \"we don't have it\". There was no reason given such as the fact that it was sold out (though that seems unlikely at 12noon), and no alternative was offered. We both settled on the \u00a313 steak sandwich. The steak was cooked as we ordered, which is good, but it was still very tough. I don't think it was that high quality. The chips were very good though! I'd love to go back to the foyer bar rather than the booking hall to try that, as it looked much better Value. Also, the staff outside the Gilbert Scott were very helpful in telling us all about the building, so that may be worth shelling out for.",

Basically, I am not The Booking Office's target clientele. Nonetheless, I came here a few weeks ago for a pre-meal weekday drink. They were hugely busy and fully booked but made room for us for almost an hour which was lovely. Staff were friendly although we were the only customers not in suits!The bar is beautifully designed, with lots of dark wood, staggeringly high ceilings and beautifully patterned menus. The chairs were huge and comfy. The draught beers are served in silver tankards and the beer list, while short, is more than acceptable. I went for a Meantime Pale Ale, which is always delicious, I think it was a half pint. For \u00a36.50, it's not cheap (but I wasn't paying!) and it was a really lovely place for a drink.",

First off, it's a hot drink and most importantly, it was disgusting. The server came over to ask us how we liked the drinks and I told her that honestly, I didn't care for it, but unlike in the States where staff would try to offer a remedy, the reply was pretty much, well yeaaa.. As if she knew the drink was awful or that she straight up didn't care. This was not great service. The location itself is pretty cool though, but the extremely pricey digesting drink was a HUGE mistake. This is definitely NOT worth the spurlge. :(",

The restaurant is also really dark and loud at night, the music was more in synced with a nightclub than a dining room. The food was delicious. We enjoyed the fish and chips which was authentic and served along with a tasty pea mash. Others in my party enjoyed the 28-day old dry aged steak, pork chops and venison. It was unfortunate the space was so loud, dark and our table was too small to really enjoy the meal.",

I had the berry pancakes and my wife got the Eggs Benedict - I would order them both again, however the coffee was our favorite part.

The beer tap list, however, was severely lacking. Table service at least was quick and friendly. We came later in the evening so were here for drinks only and didn't try any food.

It was a deceptively large space. Now, on to the cocktail. It was a play on a negroni but was based on a smokey tequila, basically a mezcal. I was recommended this drink by the server and was not disappointed. I took my time with the drink because it was sent even better over time with the ice melting and releasing some of the flavors. I would definitely recommend even if it's the weekend and it looks packed and busy.",

My coworkers and I enjoyed a nightcap at The Booking Office for three nights in a row and each visit we had the pleasure of being served by Narcissus. She was polite and professional, passionate and knowledgeable. She seemed genuinely interested in engaging with us and we enjoyed discussing all sorts of topics as she waited on our group. She did a fantastic job of making a group of Americans feel very welcome and at home across the pond! We were sad to miss her on our last night, but would recommend anyone request her if you're heading to The Booking Office for a drink. \u00a0I have had the pleasure of staying at the St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel on two business trips now and The Booking Office is definitely one of the best parts about staying at this property. It is conveniently connected to the St. Pancras Train Station (and is adjoined to the lobby of the St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel). Walking into The Booking Office sends you on a journey to a different era. You enter from the station through two glass-paned, weathered and wooden doors with brass pull handles and enter a modestly yet comfortably lit, spacious yet cozy interior with cathedral-like ceilings and Victorian Era flare, the feel of which is made all the more effective by the tangy scent of tobacco in the air. You're always greeted with a friendly smile, and the staff overall is very professional and accommodating. From the breakfast buffet to the expertly crafted cocktails, I began and ended almost all of my days at The Booking Office and the food and drinks were consistently well crafted and delicious. Wonderful experience all around!",

It can be tough for such bars to show character, so I suppose my expectations were fairly low.I needn't have worried - it turned out to be a gorgeously dramatic venue for start-of-the-night drinks. It really is all about the high arching ceiling and gothic spires - just be careful not to walk into anything whilst you're gazing upwards!I arrived first (unusually for me!) to find it almost full on a Friday evening. The front-of-house lady seemed a little reluctant to help - simply telling me they were full for drinks reservations. I gestured to a nearby empty high table against the wall in the bar area and asked if we could sit there, at which point she hesitated, seemingly because it was set for 2 people when I'd asked for 3. I solved this perplexing dilemma with the revelationary idea of moving a spare chair from the next table over. Original, right? And was only then allowed to sit down. Not sure why she couldn't have helped me with that...?The cocktail menu is a real beauty, partly taking inspiration from the Victorian era surroundings. It also takes a while to read through, so if you're thirsty go with the opening-at-a-random-page approach! Particularly as they took a very long time to mix - we were waiting at least 25mins for our three choices after ordering from the table. I was happy with my Ring of Roses when it finally arrived though - a floral treat of vodka, rose cordial, lavender essence and champagne.We didn't stay for food and I feel it's more of a statement drinks place anyway, before going somewhere cosier for dinner. Prices come in around the \u00a39-12 mark, and if your wallet doesn't stop you drinking here all night then the waiting time per cocktail probably will! Otherwise a happy cocktail stop so long as you're not in a rush...",
