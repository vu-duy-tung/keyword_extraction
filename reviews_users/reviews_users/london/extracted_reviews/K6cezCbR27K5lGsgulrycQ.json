Has quite big inside and has a good buzz about the place. Seems to be a post shopping venue for many and attract a young crowd, so always quite lively and loud so another good place to take kids. Very good service as in most of the branches and food as good as any of them. Also seems like a good venue for parties as the table are very long and you can gets lots around them.",

Another thing, if you go with someone even if you order together the dishes usually come separately, it is quite bad cause the first one ends up eating it cold. Other than that, it is good value for money.",

The main dishes are noodles (fried) and Ramen which is a big bowl of noodle soup. The chilli beef ramen does exactly what it says on the tin and is not for the faint hearted. Perfect for a warm winter's day. Chocolate ginger cheesecake dessert is brilliant. You can get green tea for free there (it says this on the menu but I think a lot of people don't notice) so it is worth ordering this with your meal if you like it, as with all London eateries they pile on the cost of drinks which makes a big difference.",

For those who have never been to Wagamama before, the restaurant is outfitted with long wooden tables that you essentially \"share\" with other people (altho there is generally a small amount of room between your party and the next). They bring out your orders as they become ready, which means that you may get your meal a few minutes before your friend, but rarely is the time difference that worth noting. I can't wait to head back to London and eat here once again!!! :)Oh, if you order the spicy edamame (chili edamame?) be prepared, it's really quite spicy! But oh-so-good!",

As my rating indicates, I've had better.The atmosphere was casual and the service was good. Those are the very good points. The food was lacklustre, to say the least. There wasn't enough seasoning or flavour - the food was rather bland. My udon noodles were overcooked, and the menu can't make up its mind what it is offering.I've eaten chinese/japanese/thai/korean in other places like NYC, San Francisco and other better establishments in London. I think of Wagamama as more of a western take on asian food, and not proper asian food.Don't get me wrong, if you want a quick fix on a low budget Wagamama is the place to go - it's like a chinese takeaway with seating.",

It would be like giving a hungry person that stuff they put in boxes - packing, it is edible, right? Gf normally douses things in hot sauce, but wagamamas is ready for that... no hot sauce. Just a weak chilli thing.I do mot know why i am seeing so many wagamamas here. Unsureif it is a british thing because british people do not like fun, or if wagamamas is just a terrible terrible place that keeps on going through dark magic, like radioshack or the republican party.

My tap water was not kept refilled and I frequently had to ask for a refill, and to top everything off when I went to the loo at the end of the meal the waiter made a rude crack to the friend I was with about me. Needless to say, I was not inclined to leave a tip. The food was excellent, however. We had duck gyoza, chicken gyoza (my favourite), the prawn kushiyaki which were outstanding, edamame with chill and garlic salt, chill squid, and a bean and glass noodle salad.

I'm not sure what my obsession with Wagamama is, but I've been to Wagamamas in Beligium, Dublin, Amsterdam, and throughout the UK. The food is Asian fusion, which I am not usually too fond of, but they feature noodles, and I love noodles! Plus, it's served with a lot of veggies and is reasonably healthy. The atmosphere helps, too. I often eat alone and I like the anonymity of sitting at the long shared tables, lost in the crowd. It's always crowded here, but the kitchen is efficient and you don't have to wait too long for your food.I like the gyoza, especially because of the chili garlic sesame soy dipping sauce. I also go for the fried udon and the kare noodles with it's rich lemongrass coconut broth.Wagamama came out with a cookbook last year, on sale at bookstores, for those of you on this side of the pond that miss the food there.",

I wanted to go with a stellar dish that is pretty consistent with taste, so I ordered the chicken teriyaki donburi. I also ordered hot green tea, which was free! The chicken teriyaki donburi had some pretty good flavors due to the kimchi and chili oil I mixed in. However, there was the smallest portion of chicken teriyaki in my dish. There were small pieces of chicken spread throughout and it seemed like I just ordered a big rice bowl with veggies. The donburi was around 10\u00a3 so I expected a decent portion of meat. I was disappointed with the extremely small portion of chicken in my dish. Besides that I was able to enjoy the flavor of the rice. I want to give them another shot and hopefully next time I can get a bigger portion of meat in my dish.",

The waiter that set us at our table was absolutely amazing and very considerate. This made this experience great!",

This Kensington High Street branch has been around for a while and is quite popular, and almost always packed at lunch. My family and I live in Dubai where we are BIG fans of the franchise. The problem is that we find the quality of food served at the UK original, this High Street Ken branch included, far inferior to what we get in the UAE. We found the ramen, usually the centrepiece of our Wagamama order, simply bland; the Ebi Katsu way, way too oily. You want a good ramen? Walk across the street to Bone Daddies. Or better yet, come to Dubai...Waste NOT. Want NOT.",

I took a long time choosing from the menu and I settled on the teriyaki chicken donburi also ordering pulled pork gyoza to share and my friends both got ramen dishes. The pulled pork gyoza was very different but delicious. The texture was so different to regular gyoza but I found the taste delightful. Both friends were very satisfied with their ramen whereas I was quite disappointed with my donburi. I like how they serve it with fresh grated carrot and greens but the chicken was very dry and unappetising. Teriyaki usually makes chicken very tender so surprised to find the meat dry. The service was very friendly (sometimes a little too much selling) and I like the canteen style set up of the restaurant with a place to put your coat and wet umbrella. I would come back here again but think I will try the ramen next time.",

O-M-G. hands-down, ultimate food porn. with the lack of different variety of food that London has, i am so grateful for this place. My friends had the beef kushiyaki, chicken kushiyaki, and wagamama ramen, lollipop Prawn kushiyaki= ok... but i wouldn't recommend getting it chicken & beef kushiyaki = very gushy texture, so if you aren't a fan of oysters or anything that is gushy, don't get it. But it was ok as well. Not the best but definitely not the worst. a lot of my friends did not like it though As for the ramen -- all the ramen = AMAZING!! the portion is huge so have a huge appetite when you walk in. all in all, you can simply skip the appetizers and go straight for the ramen. in the end you can have some room for the delicious flowering jasmine tea and or the vanilla tea. \u00a0Service is greatFood is amazing Tea good. desserts: my friends got the passion fruit \u00a0cheesecake & they loved it. the apple goyza tastes like those kfc apple turnovers to me = taste of home =P",

It was the saltiest broth we've ever experienced. \u00a0We're pretty sure we'll be passing Wagamama related kidney stones very soon :(. \u00a0It didn't taste at all like traditional ramen It tasted like dirty salt water with a hint of chicken broth. \u00a0We swear they didn't wash the spring onions thoroughly cause dirty earth is all you could taste once your pallet worked through the salt. \u00a0We would rather have had the broth from a Top Ramen package... See where we're going with this?Meat... It was grilled chicken breast. \u00a0Which is pretty good in a sandwich but tasted unrelated to the rest of the dish. Does that make sense? \u00a0It gave the dirty broth a smokey taste. \u00a0As if someone had lit mud on fire..Noodles... on our last Ramen review we thought Ebisu's in Fountain Valley had the worst noodles... but Wagamama takes the crown. \u00a0Underdone spaghetti noodles that only had flavor because it was sitting in salt.We really feel that Wagamama has to take the word \"Ramen\" off their menu and just call it soup... \u00a0Because what they were serving isn't remotely close to what Ramen is suppose to be. \u00a0There has got to be a much better Ramen being served somewhere in London.",
