Portions were large and were good value for money in comparison to other places in the area. The drinks were good as well, with a different twist to them such as pickle based shots! Sounds disgusting I know, but actually were really nice! Will have to go back there sober to ensure that it is as nice as remembered!",

This location is much better. Also, they have good beers here!",

Like its Soho brethren, Bodean's Tower Hill also has a less formal, take away eating area upstairs with the more comfy lounge and cushioned backed chairs downstairs. Small, silver coated pigs heads coat the wall, probably a testament to all of the meat soon to be consumed in the next meal. Either way, I have to give a thumbs up to their food once again, with the ribs I think improving since my last visit as the meat was soft and full of flavour even though I wanted to have more of their spicy (it wasn't that spicy) chipotle BBQ covering the meat. Their pulled pork was a little bit more disappointing this time as it just wasn't as moist as I remembered it though tasty nevertheless. Completed stuffed after this meal, Bodean's Tower Hill still satisfies and even has a number of great deals during the week including a \u00a310 all you can eat rib-fest sure to please even the hungriest of meat-eaters.",

No aperitif can work better than that. The decor is very typical of the other Bodeans and the big screens, which I find a little distracting, are on either side of the restaurant. Still a nice cosy warm atmosphere, friendly and attentive service. Chatting about rib combo experiences along Blouberg Beach restaurants, it was decided we will make up our own combo.The first thing our waiter did when he heard our order was to move us from a table for 2 to a table for 4 :-)The lamb ribs were superb, tender and tasty as were the Baby Back pork ribs, smoky and juicy. I was very disappointed with the beef ribs that were dry and so tough I had to slice the meat off the bone. That is a sacrilege for any rib eater as fingers are the order of the day.The extra BBQ sauces on the table, in different flavours, were good. I do recall some chips and coleslaw as well but did not try any, although it looked fresh.I would certainly go again as there are a few others bit on the menu that caught my eye and the ribs were ever so moreish.",

Pretty much the same deal as the Soho branch but the diner was a bit of a let down as it wasn't very well laid out. However they've recently redone the diner and it's amazing!

Out of cornbread then you see they see clearly dishing it out to other patrons and out of dessert if they want you to give up your table.Foodwise I they cook pulled pork well, sort of bland but there is a selection of sauces. Ribs are nothing to rave home about but if you are craving cheap meat and rootbeer after a night on the town...well you might have a more exciting (less sober) review",

They do all the regular barbecue styles and treats that would be expected, and it looks like they had NFL games on during the weekend maybe. They also have a good selection of beers. The only downside was that the server was terrible at his job, and it took us 30-45 minutes to get our tickets, and then another 20 to get them fixed.

    "text": "It's competent. Having experienced a lot of US BBQ while I lived there I can't honestly say that this is amazing. It's like a fairly pricey and somehow even-more-contrived TGI Fridays. The meat is cooked, though when you order don't be surprised that if 45 minutes later you are still waiting for your food and even when it arrives, it's not what you ordered. Luckily we got something fancier than we ordered at no extra charge- the waiter was very apologetic and I almost feel guilty saying it but it was late and it was wrong. It worked out alright for us but evidently this isn't always the case, sounds like there's something systemically wrong in the way they're running the place.I resent having to pay so much for the drinks! So there's Blue Moon, Brooklyn Lager etc and I understand these aren't quite as common as Carling and Fosters but they're really not so rare that you could mark them up quite so much. I didn't appreciate that, especially as they're trying so hard to go for the dive/ sports bar theme. There's not much in the way of a reasonably priced drink on the menu. The food was okay, could have been better seasoned but I'll hold back on judgement since I didn't get what I asked for so I can't really comment on that. I'll go back, definitely because it wasn't an unpleasant experience I just felt really underwhelmed and anticlimactic about the whole thing.",

Ordered pulled pork sandwich with sweet potato fries and an order of burnt ends for the table. The fries were AMAZING!! If Tower Bridge wasn't visible in the distance I could almost believe that I was in Georgia. Sandwich was decent, the burnt ends were a bit mediocre. Give me cornbread with cracklins' any day. Multiple games on the televisions and staff were more than willing to change to game that we wanted to watch. Mixed drinks prices were outrageous, but the atmosphere and food (minus burnt ends) made me feel a little closer to home. \u00a0Also appreciate the takeaway so I can eat my BBQ at home in my sweats in front of the Telly.",

After trying this BBQ for the second time I have noticed a pattern..if the wait staff is busy then they will say they are out of it. Out of cornbread then you see they see clearly dishing it out to other patrons and out of dessert if they want you to give up your table. Foodwise I they cook pulled pork well, sort of bland but there is a selection of sauces. Ribs are nothing to rave home about but if you are craving cheap meat and rootbeer after a night on the town...well you might have a more exciting (less sober) review",

    "text": "Quite close to Tower Hill and the Tower of London, this Bodean's is slightly different from the Clapham branch in that this one is split-level with a more restaurant feel downstairs and a diner upstairs: it also has an excellent value take away menu. To give you an idea on prices a pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and fries is \u00a35.75, and an 8oz burger and fries to take away is \u00a37.50, the take away prices are typically about 50p-\u00a31 cheaper. I had the \u00a0chicken, pulled pork & grilled smoke sausage combo with fries and coleslaw for \u00a314.95. Realistically it would probably have fed two people! It was all very tasty, good value and I washed it down with a bottomless \u00a32.50 fountain diet coke. Recommended for meat-eaters, but veggies better beware! The Bodean's Classic Macaroni Cheese contains smoked chicken! There are a couple of fish dishes: tuna steak and shrimp dinner both are served with coconut rice, but not a big choice.",

    "text": "Desperately searching for somewhere to have a meal even mildly reminiscent of a home-cooked Thanksgiving meal, a few my friends and I booked Bodeans in Tower Hill. Full disclosure: we looked everywhere else in the hope that there were spaces, but in the end we had to take the last remaining table and rely on hope alone that they might have an inkling of how to replicate a decent meal for us poor, lonely, family-less saps on arguably the most pleasant holiday of the year. Holy shit did we get that wrong....Firstly, my cheery \"Happy Thanksgiving\" directed at the hurried waiter was returned with total puzzlement at what I was saying. It took 3 repeats to get him to fumble some sort of response that was more of a gurgle than anything else. We then realized (because he said it) that it was because he was Greek and they don't have Thanksgiving in Greece.... fair enough, it's not your thing, I understand.... And then there was the food... a massive (granted) undercooked turkey leg with soggy skin and less flavor than clean air, freshly boiled and rubbery ham slices that I can only presume had been candied, slices of turkey breast that crumbled at the merest vibration, stuffing which can only have been a corn muffin broken up in chunks, and topped off (literally) with a fishbowl of brown sugar water with a few slivers of onion and other species happily swimming about.The pumpkin pie looked to be the only thing that was home made, and that's only because the crust had that gnarled and crumbled look that can only come out of an amateur kitchen. That and the filling came out of a can, which I grant you is how most people make their pumpkin pie but we chose to poo poo it regardless.I've been to the Bodeans in Fulham and had a hugely disappointing pulled pork sandwich, so I will be avoiding this chain like a Turkey with big plans to make it past the last Thursday in November....Alternatives: Pitt Cue, Blues Kitchen, Big Easy, ANYWHERE ELSE!!!!",

I'm kinda surprised about some of the glowing reviews of this place! \u00a0That said, upon first finding it a few years ago I probably would have glowed just as much.I'm from the south of the US originally, so I like my BBQ, and having been in the UK for a while was shocked to hear that there was a BBQ place in London. \u00a0(I know, I know, London has everything... it still took me by surprise for some reason!) \u00a0Upon first inspection the place seemed fine... exciting even, mirroring that BBQ joint vibe, but on a larger scale than what I would normally see. \u00a0I've been several times now, and tried many of the dishes (sharing platters, chicken, ribs, burnt ends, etc.), and while never that bad they aren't normally that great either to be honest... they just seem to be lacking that certain something that sets a great BBQ joint apart.The food prices aren't terrible for London, although \u00a37 for a Blue Moon does sting a bit!The place is clean, the staff normally friendly, and it is certainly jumping (extra points for showing some NHL games!)... it helps to have a reservation if you're going at peak times, but I normally prefer to make the trek to Dukes Brew & Queue (near the Haggerston Overground stop) over this place these days... the ribs between the two are simply night and day!So I think this place is about expectations... if you need a BBQ fix or something a bit novel then by all means give it a go, but now that I'm over the novelty of it I personally find myself going elsewhere when it comes to the food alone.",

    "text": "Despite hearing mixed reviews about this place, I braved the wind and rain out of hope for some delicious bbq. The visit didn't get off to a great start as, despite there being plenty of free tables, we couldn't be seated as the staff member front of house was tied up with a difficult customer on the phone. We were soon at the front of a long queue leading out of the restaurant. We were eventually seated by a different staff member who just came in to start her shift. If she hadn't come in who knows how long we'd have been waiting for! They either need to move the phone somewhere else or have another member of staff who can step in in this scenario Anyway, enough of the whinging. Onto the good stuff. Lots of American beers that you don't really see were present (lookin' at you, Lone Star) with wine, cocktails and milkshakes all making appearances. Some of these beers are pretty expensive for the size of the bottle but I can only assume that's due to the difficulty of sourcing them. We started with buffalo wings and elected to go all out with the dreaded Diablo sauce. The wings were pretty big, with a good amount of meat on them. The exterior was crispy and the inside juicy. Perfectly cooked chicken. And the sauce. Oh my god the sauce. The sauce was amazing. The interplay with the spice and the tomato and the blue cheese was beautiful. BEAUTIFUL I TELLS YA!I've had some pretty amazing pork ribs in my time and I have to say these were pretty good. They weren't quite up to the standard of the St Louis dry rub you can get in The Big Easy in Covent Garden but they weren't too far off. The baby back ribs here were even closer to that rib nirvana. Now let's talk about sides. Any menu that has creamed corn on is a winner in my book. Plus you gotta try the burnt ends. They're so tender and the sauce they come in just brings out so much flavour. Probably not great enough to have on its own for a main course but as a side it works wonders but at \u00a39.95 you kinda expect it to. That is the one real downside of the place: the price. While not everything is massively overpriced, there are a few items that are and I don't remember seeing anything particularly cheap. But hey, at least you're getting decent food tl;dr bbq food is pretty good but not the best, apart from the chicken wings cos they're perfect. Minus point: tad on the expensive side",

This particular locale, located around the corner from the Tower Hill tube stop, has a proper American Bar feel in the front, with booth-like table areas in the back and in a surprisingly vast area downstairs. I went here twice: once when a little piece of New York hit me and that impulse had me looking at the takeaway menu after a late work night.It wasn't the impulse for American food (which I never ate in NY, either). It was the desire for a real takeaway meal that wasn't crap. This place delivered (no pun intended), with, as it turns out, tasty and spicy Jerk Chicken. \u00a0 When you're tired and want to eat without cooking, is the choice always between eating cheap and greasy takeaway, cooking, or starving? \u00a0No, it's not. \u00a0Anymore.A second time I came back to eat in, sitting at the bar to try the Burnt Ends and an ale called Stone Levitation. This turned out to be pleasing enough to remind me to write this review. That and the very friendly service. It's not very London at all for staff to regularly ask you if you need anything else and notice when your glass is empty. I was shocked when the bartender was actually chatting up patrons and being friendly without being overwhelming. \u00a0This is the sort of thing that makes clients go back. \u00a0And I plan to do that. If there's any -1, it's the radio / noisiness. \u00a0I guess I wasn't looking for anything THAT authentic. ;-) \u00a0 But you can't have it all, can you.For a moment, I felt like I was in New York. I'm hoping to relive that without having to book a flight, and now that I found this place, the airline companies are about to lose crazy air fare on me.",

Good smoke flavor on the meats and the sauces were both good. Service and prices very good as well.",

We ordered the cornbread muffins and onion rings, Bodean's sharing platter which comes with spare ribs and baby back ribs, burnt ends, pulled pork and chicken thighs, and fries.Service was quick and the casual vibe was great, but the food was a letdown. The pulled pork was dry and cold, the cornbread was too heavy, the fries were a bit soggy, and the ribs lacked in flavor. The chicken and burnt ends were probably the best selection of the platter.Maybe other Bodean's are better but I'm not entirely convinced by this one.",

So with trepidation I joked to the missus that we should visit at lunch on a Saturday while nearby. She didn't realise I was kinda kidding and we ended there.To be fair, it's improved. It still has that silly hour and a half seating thing and the tables are still too small to take the horde of bottles on them when you arrive, but it was a solid meal.I had the pulled pork bun, while she had the trip tip sandwich. My pork was dry, but that was fixed using a bottle of BBQ sauce. The fries were good, as was the creamed corn. Even her tri tip was ok. It's redeemed itself in my eyes - I'm not at the stage where this is once again a destination restaurant, but if I'm in the area again I won't be cracking jokes about it.",

Not many chips, not as filling as i'd been preparing myself for but the taste made up for it. The combo of 1/4 chicken, pulled pork and ribs was in my opinion a small portion but very tasty. The service is best yet, they will literally go out of there way to do anything for you. Including free ice cream. Overall 4 stars due to portion sizes and table sizes.",

Their ribs were lightly smoked as it didn't have the bark (color) that is indicative of proper smoking. \u00a0Plus, ribs should leave a bite mark, but were a bit tough to bite through.2. Proper salsa should be thick and full of veg, peppers, spice, etc., not liquid and full of water. \u00a0And don't get me started on the guacamole - it was rubbish and probably came from a bag or can. \u00a0FYI go to Texas or Mexico for proper salsa.3. Their \"burnt ends\" did not look or taste like real burnt ends - they are just large cuts of fatty brisket (not appetizing). \u00a0KC BBQ is mostly pork-based so if you're going to try a brisket and offer burnt ends, learn from a Texan.The only positives were the chicken breast, coleslaw and pulled pork. \u00a0By the looks of the London BBQ scene, your best bet is to do it yourselves and enjoy the self-satisfaction I experience every time I BBQ.",

There were some things i really liked, but some i didn't:To preface I'm an american who definitely has enthusiasm for bbq but was pretty much just here to watch nfl football. The good: - they broke their \"schedule\" to put on the game i wanted to see. - They had one of the better tap lists I've seen so far in my short stay in england.The bad: - the fact that all the tvs in the two story restaurant/bar have to play the same channel, which made them extremely reluctant to change it for probably the only people in the bar who were invested in an nfl team. When they did the game was in like 360p resolution which made it hard to follow. - they dont have bbq at all. I had ribs at this place and these ribs hadnt been anywhere near a smoker. They were most likely not slow cooked because they had little flavor and were pretty tough and dry. Honestly the worst ribs i've ever had. Also the ribs were mostly likely st. Louis style but were advertised as baby back. Appetizer selection was bad. The wings were REALLY expensive like 10\u00a3 for 6 and there wasn't anything that seemed snacky.If it wasn't for the service and the beer. I would have given this place 1 star but they get another one because if you want some good beer and to watch football in england this is your place. Just dont eat their disgusting food.",

The service is friendly but never overly so and that's appreciated by my party. The only thing I was a bit disappointed with were the Diablo wings. I've had them once before and I swear they were much more spicy the last time. You think Diablo and you want something that will melt your face. There was definitely no face melting occurring.Other than that, it was a fantastic evening. Game Dag special for \u00a315 is a great deal.

    "text": "A little taste of America... yes please! \u00a0While it is not the best BBQ I have ever had... \u00a0I think Bodean's makes a valiant effort, more than any other restaurant that does BBQ (that I have been to so far).I was attracted by the Pulled Pork on the menu. \u00a0If there is one thing that I have missed since living here in the UK, it is a Pulled Pork Sandwich. \u00a0I'm not quite sure about the interior and it was a little too dark for my taste, but then again I wasn't on a romantic date. \u00a0Then again, I don't know who would take someone on a romantic date to a BBQ restaurant. \u00a0A BBQ restaurant is more of a \"we've been together for awhile and I'm comfortable enough for you to see me wearing a bib, eating ribs with BBQ sauce all over my face\" sort of date, but maybe that's just me. \u00a0On the table was a wooden condiment holder with ketchup, French's Mustard, Cholula Hot Sauce, and then their three BBQ sauces. \u00a0There was also a roll of paper towel... which you would find at any respectable BBQ joint in the states.Anyway I noticed a couple of things on the menu that caught my eye: \u00a0A&W Cream Soda, A&W Root Beer, Iced Tea, Clam Chowder, Cornbread, and creamed corn. \u00a0While I hadn't tried some of their versions of these items, I was just excited that they had it on the menu and were attempting them. \u00a0I ordered an iced tea with extra ice... \u00a0yes, it is because I am American. \u00a0It is probably a good idea that I had the extra ice because the tea was quite sweet and the extra ice mellowed it out a bit. \u00a0While I am a big fan of sweet tea, the kind of sweet of this iced tea wasn't quite the same...It took awhile for the waitress to come back and take my order because she thought I was waiting for someone... \u00a0While waiting there were two large, flat screen t.v.s so I could watch baseball, if I was interested in baseball. \u00a0I really wanted to try the clam chowder, but thought I probably wouldn't have much room for anything else, so I ordered the Pulled Pork Platter and a piece of cornbread. \u00a0What was amazing, was the speed at which that plate of food appeared on the table after I had ordered it. \u00a0While it was nice that it came out so fast because I was hungry, it made me question the quality of the food...When the waitress brought out my food, she did explain the condiments, which was nice and even tried to recommend one for my pulled pork. \u00a0I tried her recommendation for the vinegar based sauce, but I prefer my sauce to be a bit on the sweet and smokey side with a bit of spiciness to it, so the Smoked Hickory sauce was the one that I opted for. \u00a0The pulled pork does not come with sauce on it, which is nice if you want to choose your own sauce and how much of it. \u00a0The pork was tender and juicy, which was a little surprising seeing as how it did not come with sauce.The sides for the pulled pork were coleslaw and creamed corn. \u00a0You can change the sides, although the ones that cost a little more to substitute are marked. \u00a0The coleslaw was more like American coleslaw, not as heavy on the mayo, but could've used some seasoning like celery seed/salt as it was a bit bland. \u00a0The creamed corn... \u00a0well it wasn't exactly what I was expecting and I was hoping that I would love it, but I didn't. \u00a0I don't really know how to describe it... \u00a0you know that pistachio, creamy, jello salad thingy with unknown bits in it that you have probably had at a family reunion... \u00a0well it kind of had that consistency, but no pistachio, just cream and corn...The cornbread was nice. \u00a0It came out warm served with butter, and I got two pieces. \u00a0The waitress checked on me a couple times, which was nice and unexpected. \u00a0When I was finished, she brought some handwipes out, which should be on hand when you are eating BBQ. \u00a0Overall, I enjoyed parts of my meal... \u00a0I would go back, but I would probably substitute sides.",

Welcoming atmosphere and decor was unique and fitting to this cuisine, we were sat downstairs on a large long table to the right. Service was slow and a little disjointed, with drinks being forgotten and waiting staff having a hard time understanding and communicating with us due to English not being their first language. Our food orders were eventually taken after several prompts but on arrival some had mistakes, but despite the poor service the food was very good. Tasty fresh fries, the burnt ends could do with a bit more burning but would definitely recommend anyway. The famous dry thunder chicken thighs were very nice but the diablo sauce although nice was not as spicy as I was led to believe or hoped although there was chilli sauce available on each table, although most bottles were empty when we hunted for more! The side salad I ordered with my chicken was basic salad leaves and two cherry tomatoes, this is very poor and disappointing and should be looked at.The portions were a good size so you definitely won't leave hungry!I will return to try some more dishes but perhaps another branch.",

They have 'baconnaise' for heaven's sake - how hadn't I heard of that before?! Not a fan of mayonnaise but very much a fan of anything with the essence of bacon added...As long as you don't mind brimmingly busy dining experiences (and stairs) then their Tower Hill branch is well worth popping in for a Soho Special (go large, or go home). Pretty much everything is served with coleslaw and fries. God bless the Americans.Tower Hill is the nearest underground station on the Circle & District lines. They also have restaurants in Soho, Clapham and Fulham. I'm hopeful that you get a jar of baconnaise to take home if you visit them all...",

Previous reviews looked good, so we thought we'd try it.Wow, we were really impressed! It wasn't just good BBQ for England, it was downright good BBQ period.We had the 1/2 baby back rib platter, the pulled pork sandwich, and the 1/2 beef burnt ends/pulled pork. All were excellent, the fries were crispy, and didn't get soggy by the end of meal. Coleslaw was creamy - we didn't necessarily care for that, but it was good coleslaw nonetheless.I was also very impressed by how they served my Diet Coke - in a big glass with ICE! and plenty of it! Yes, American style, haha!",

After being blown away by the lack of eating establishments serving food at this time, Bodean's actually found its way into our bellies twice... unintentional the second time around, we're still thankful for their service.Hey, we're Americans, so we're gonna judge barbecue like Americans, i.e. harshly. So I'd call the food itself admirably four-star. It's real barbecue, done very nicely. We went for the Soho Special, a sandwich with half burnt ends and half pulled pork. Really tasty, and the regular size is more than enough for one person.Also, gotta credit the fries (chips, whatever). The seasoning is really good and makes for more than just a thoughtless side dish. My wife liked the coleslaw so much, she put it on her sandwich.I give the fifth star for exceptional service and friendliness. And openness. Open is good.",

This is one of my 2 favourite BBQ chains in London and I normally visit the OLd Street branch that I absolutely love.We were in a late evening walk and wanted some coffee on Saturday evening. All the coffee shops had shut, but we saw a Bodeans that was open. I adore their espresso martinis and it seemed like a great idea for the caffeine fix we were craving.The hostess at the door, said they didn't have seats. We said we just wanted a quick drink and we're fine with standing at the bar, so she let us in, while a queue formed outside.The bartenders were quite friendly, but service took some time and when the drinks came, they were a complete disappointment. Nothing like the rich, creamy and sweet espresso martini, I am served at the old street \u00a0branch, the coffee was bad and bitter and had been standing for 2 long and had been diluted. Fortunately with my Bodeans card, I get a free Fireball cinnamon whisky and that helped me get a pleasant after taste.We also decided to use the washrooms downstairs, as we wanted to walk for another couple of hours. We were pointed downstairs and that's when we realised that the half the downstairs was empty and yet there were people being made to queue in the cold outside. It wasn't like they had set aside space for a large party or that they were understaffed.It just left a bad impression overall and we will never go back to this branch.",

In KC, there are easily 100 BBQ restaurants for a population of 2 million; in London, there are six.Bodean's is pretty good, all things considered. We had the pulled pork, pork ribs, brisket, and burnt ends. The ribs were fall off the bone, pulled pork was decent, brisket was tasty (thicker sliced, as it should be), but the burnt ends weren't the best KC burnt ends we've ever had (but better than anyone in Texas could do, mind you).I also had the chicken wings. The hottest flavor, which I was assured people have actually cried eating. They weren't so hot, but compared to mushy peas, they were excellent.",

We went with the large buffalo wings to share for a starter, with the BBQ sauce option, and I have honestly never seen wings so big. They were very tasty and hit the spot nicely.I opted for a beef burger which was absolutely fantastic. The patty was huge, which makes me thank my lucky stars I decided not to double up as I struggled to finish it just as a single! It was excellently flavoured and the salad gave that nice satisfying crunch required to make a good burger. The red onions were particularly well placed, adding a pleasant tang with every bite.It took a while to get the bill but other than that, this is an amazing restaurant with lots on offer no matter your tastes.",

    "text": "Ever the BBQ lover, I equally love introducing other people to it, making suggestions and trying to impart the little bit of knowledge I have. Situated right next to the WW1 poppy display, close to the tube and a short walk from the brother's flat, Bodean's became the logical choice.Our only worry was the number in our party - 7 - and the potential wait. However, they were surprisingly accommodating and, after a 15/20 minute wait, we received our text alert to let us know our table was ready. Seated downstairs, the atmosphere was loud and exciting, and I couldn't wait to get stuck in to the menu. They have all the goodies here; wings, nachos, numerous ribs, hot dogs, burgers, chicken, pulled pork, and even the rarely-seen-in-the-UK burnt ends. We ordered a round of drinks and, after some conversation about what we could share and how many sides we could potentially eat between us, the food.There were plenty of different meals around the table, but I went for the tri-trip sandwich, which involved melt-y soft beef on a sesame bun, served with fries and coleslaw. The meat was delicious, but the bun fell apart very quickly (even when flipping upside down in the usual fashion) and the fries didn't blow me away. I tried to liven them up with some of the hot sauce, but again, it was slightly lacklustre. The sweet potato fries were a tastier side, and seemed to have a better crisp to them. The onion rings, although tasty, were slightly anemic - papa wasn't impressed, and he knows what he's talking about! The chicken wings with bourbon sauce were a lovely, sticky, saucey mess, though I was slightly taken a-back when we tried to order mild and were told that mild just meant plain.Everyone around the table was full and content, though I think it was perhaps missing a bit of the 'edge' we have become accustomed to, and service was slightly unfocused due to the masses of people. I'd try again - but perhaps a different branch? Oh, and I'd totally decorate my house in the Bodean's way. Golden pig head = win.",

    "text": "Bodeans each and every time I've visited has been incredibly disappointing. It gets nearly everything right, then fails on the food each time. I will say now Bodean's totally delivered on this visit to the one close to the Tower of London.Staff were great. Constantly stopped by to ask how we were. Very friendly and relaxed.We ordered a sharing selection of meats and it was amazing. Meats were falling off the bone. Pulled pork was tender as silk, chicken just wow. Good helpings of coleslaw and chips completed an epic meal which we just about finished, but it was a good struggle particularly as I was wondering if we had enough when it first arrived. Bodean's sauces were epic. Some people don't like a lot of sauce on their meats. I'm of the opposite variety. I love bbq sauce and the hickory and chipotle sauce is much appreciated, especially when some other places actually charge for sauces by the thimble. Insulting to say the least. Keep it up guys.",

    "text": "I'd heard a lot about Bodeans, so expectations were high when I finally got to try it out! We were hung over and hungry, and it was a very hot day! Thankfully they have ace air con, and we were soon cooled down and ready for food. I opted for the chicken, pulled pork and sausage combination to share with my other half, and a few sides (maximising my food options!). The food arrived fairly quickly, and looked amazing! The meat was ALL delicious, and was accompanied by some coleslaw and sweet potato fries (I paid extra to upgrade from regular). The chicken was my absolute favourite, it was so juicy and tasty, I was a bit gutted that I had to share! The sides were a bit of a let down... We ordered the poutine, and I was somewhat disappointed with the huge amounts of chewy melted cheese - a far cry from the traditional cheese curds. The poutine was also cold, so it was returned and replaced with a less cheesy and hotter portion, and was also taken off the bill which was a nice touch. We also opted for a side of mac and cheese. This came with a pleasant breadcrumb topping, and was surprisingly light! The sauce wasn't super thick and cheesy like most versions of the dish I've had, and I was a little disappointed - my hangover definitely wanted the heavier and more comforting kind!Next came dessert. \u00a0I went for the key lime pie and a coffee - a good combo deal at just \u00a35. The pie topping was light and almost moussey, with a lovely sharp tang. It went down very easily!All in all not bad, but not as good as the hype - but not as good as the closer to home Reds.....",

I want to say that the Service was awesome but the ribs and burnt ends are just as good as you'll find in a small town in Texas. Also, you can catch American football on at given times. Call and they can tell you what game will be playing. Shout out to all the bar staff and my new friend Bill who is a regular there. He'll be around the bar area with a happy smile.",

    "text": "As a Bodean's virgin and the fact that I was invited to lunch without paying attention to where I was going I really didn't know what to expect.On arrival the restaurant appears to be a small converted bar similar to the one in the programme Cheers is the way I would describe it lol. You are also met by a friendly greeter. We were escorted downstairs to a much larger area decorated with red walls and gold pigs/cow heads. Funnily enough it works :).The menu is easy to read and the service very quick indeed. We ordered the Bodean's platter for 3 and the food arrived within 10 mins which is an added bonus when you are in a tight schedule. I have to say the taste of the BBQ was lovely and I throughly enjoyed the array of pulled pork, 2 different sets of ribs, chicken thighs , slaw and seasoned fries. The BBQ Mayo is a lovely touch too.I saw lots of plates flying around as the place was packed , my advice would be don't order the burger if you are hungry, it appeared quite small.All in all a definite recommendation if you have a meat craving. Top tip on game days there are special offers on food and beer!!",
