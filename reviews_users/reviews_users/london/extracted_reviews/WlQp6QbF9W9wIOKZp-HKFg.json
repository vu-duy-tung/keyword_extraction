Perfect!3) Nice soft bun that didn't require extensive surgery (on the bun not me!) to get it in one mouthful. Hate those ciabatta monstrosities that rip your mouth to shreds. The not so good...1) Short menu. The fancyiest burger has just 3 toppings bacon, cheese and Byron sauce. I didn't order this because it sounded like a saltfest (bacon and capers in the sauce) but in retrospect that's exactly what my burger need. More seasoning and more sauce. My cheesburger just tasted of meat, tomato and lettuce as the mature cheddar wasn't bring much to the party and in a country where tomatoes taste of water that's not enough. I ended up throwing on all the condiments on the table (mustard, chili sauce, ketchup) in a desperate bid to make it taste of something2) The courgette fries. These got slightly too greasy halfway through the bowl. I felt a bit sick after eating these. Stick to regular.So where would I put Byron in the league table of chain burger places? Better that the travesty that is Fine Burger not as good as GBK. Byron-it's OK!",

Used to go to The Diner but was always a bit disappointed with them - now I will be at Byron instead, having a juicy, cooked-to-order burger with some amazing courgette fries. This place rocks, even if the decor is a bit too unfinished for my taste (the ceiling joists are exposed, making it look like you're eating in a building site). Our party of 6 was seated quickly and service was friendly (perhaps even overly friendly for England?) Jugs of tap water get them even more bonus points. Next time I'm trying the oreo milkshake.",

    "text": "It was a cold dark night and I craved some meat. I have also been reading about this place since what feels like new restaurant chain opening time began and thought its time to see what the fuss was about. I was impressed. I had a full on cheeseburger, loaded with jack cheese and the hand cut fries and a gingerbeer. Yes I have become that rock and roll these days. My beloved had the same cheeseburger, but because she wanted a girly version she had the skinny one which had no bun but a rather nice salad which I ate lots of too. It had a great variety of leaves that included peppery ones and ones that had little red streaks on so it didn't end up being oily green stuff. The dressing was sharp and tangy too. She did have some fries so we wouldn't end up ordering more. Or the age old thing that happens when you eat with a girl - they say they don't want chips and then they end up eating all of yours. Then the next day complain that they are putting on weight. OK before I get flame grilled alive more than the burgers, I must add that my beloved isn't one of those those ladies! The food in there is so moorish and lovely that you will find yourself reluctant to share. Burger food is about being slightly gluttonous anyway. The meat in the burgers was lean yet really flavourful and juicy. The cheese had the right melty balance with the cheese that didn't feel like you were swallowing grease nor would be likely to be sweating meat and cheese for the next week. I love burgers but I don't eat them often as I know they aren't the healthiest things on the planet but sometimes when you want to feel you are being slapped on the back by a gruff lumberjack, nothing does this better than a burger. A good one at that. The service in there was good, staff attentive but not irritating. The menu in Byron is simple but I am glad they keep it that way. I think it's important (especially where burgers are concerned) to keep it simple and to focus on making a really good base product. Every time I want a good burger my choice shall be Byron. I also loved the exposed brickwork and deliberately mismatched chairs. It had a very own industrial chic about it and food was prompt. If you haven't gone already then check it out! It doesn't burn a hole in your pocket and you leave feeling satisfied in having eaten naughty but very nice food.",

After ordering they had a couple of chairs that you could sit in and wait for your food as the entrance is very tiny when coming in, and I felt like I was in the way of everyone. \u00a0Be sure to ask for ketchup when you order take out as they don't automatically pack it. \u00a0Even though the place was crowded and the servers were running around like chickens with their heads cut off, they were all very friendly. \u00a0I had a ginger beer as I was waiting, and it was fantastic. I wish I remembered the brand name. \u00a0They packed all the food nicely into a easy to carry paper bag, which I quickly took home and unwrapped. \u00a0Everything was still hot and fresh when I started to eat, and it was very tasty. \u00a0I would definitely go back for the Portobello. \u00a0Good mushroom burgers are hard to find. \u00a0The fries were also exactly what I was hoping for.",

The interior is, at this stage, so under-developed that I wasn't quite sure if they haven't actually finished. Everywhere is bare brick walls, timber and \"toilets upstairs\" scribbled on the way in felt-tip pen. However, the kitchen is gleaming new and appears to be working well. The hamburgers themselves were great: flavoursome and fresh without being overladen. The sides (hand-cut skin on chips and onion rings) were a perfect compliment. I also went for a chocolate malt which was just the right side of thick and served as an awesome starter, accompaniment and desert. I will definitely keep coming back as long as they keep serving burgers this good.",

    "text": "Sometimes, like Joni Mitchell sang, you don't know what you've got until it's gone. And that's very much the case with a Byron burger, which disappeared rather quickly after it arrived at my table. And while I'm sure I've had better burgers, I'll be darned if I can remember them. But I do remember Byron's burger - and every meat patty between a bun since just hasn't measured up. Yes, the menu isn't exactly extensive. But this is a burger joint, not The Ivy. Frankly, I'd be a bit worried if they were pushing an inventive scallop dish as a starter. It's always a sign of confidence if you don't get a great deal of choice, and there's more than enough options with extra toppings to keep you happy. The burgers themselves are deceptively filling - a decent size yet a challenge to you when you reach the last couple of mouthfuls. Plus the meat is tender and pink in the middle and the grilling is just right. The courgette fries are also a clever and utterly delicious addition to a meal and much more moreish than the standard fries. You'll be plotting how to make them at home, and failing. And this is without mentioning the huge onion rings. A few criticisms: they forget the extra bacon in my friend's burger, but the staff were very quick, friendly helpful and apologetic and fixed this quickly. Plus I'm not entirely sure if I'm keen on the 'half-renovated-before-the-builders-took-an-extended-tea-break' is quite my thing. But there's no arguing with the quality of burgers, the speed of service, the friendly staff and the price. Maybe I'll find a better burger in London over the coming months, but it'll have to go a long way to top Byron.",

Loved the stripped back, almost rustic, look; when you look down from first floor you can see to joists. Cheeseburger with Gruyere cheese was yummy and not greasy like some other burger joints (eg.

Distressed exterior, raw pipework inside...the entire feel is very raw but it works and is especially beautiful at night. Anyway - we couldn't eat in tonight as we were both exhausted from a day with the kids so I called up and ordered a takeaway (collection only). Our food was excellent. My skinny fries were great, really full of flavour and my wife's skin on chips were even better. Our cheeseburgers were just perfect - soft bun, great meat. I wolfed mine down in seconds! To top it off our milkshakes were off the hook - my OREO cookie one fantastic. Byron works well because it delivers simple simple food but with lots of flavour and no fuss. It's exactly what you want from an honest burger place but goes that little bit further to make you want to come back. My only tiny tiny tiny gripe (which may not apply to most people) is that our burgers were very much medium / rare - i.e. chargrilled on the outside, pink inside. Whilst I LOVE my burgers like this my wife didn't like the rawness so much - so if your'e not a fan of raw meat then please make sure you ask for a well done version! Can't wait to go back - well done BYRON!",

Bonus points for the pickle.I enjoy their gritty but trendy decor, although maybe they went a little too far on the exposed wiring and plumbing. The main deterrants to this place are how busy it gets and the extravagant prices. \u00a0A 12 to 13 pound bill for a burger and fries just seems wrong to me, where in the (also expensive) Bay Area you'd be getting a beer with a high quality burger for the same or lower price.",

In area that really appeals to everyone's palette, Byron is perfect if you want an American style burger. I like my hamburger medium and It was received more more medium rare...it was not that big of a deal for me so I didn't feel the need to send it back. Fries and dessert were both really good as well.

Instead I just bought a burger. A damn good burger. It involved spicy BBQ sauce, pepper jack cheese and was cooked to perfection. I've also recently indulged in a beetroot salad and an Oreo milkshake that literally blew my mind when it arrived in a milkshake cup with the extra on the side. So really Byron, your burgers, sides, salads and milkshakes bring the boys to the yard. Why are you spending time and money posing as anything but a great local burger joint?",

One thing to be weary of is that even when ordering your burger medium, it is likely to come back to you quite pink. This has been consistent for me across all Byron visits - As I tend to order medium rare I was rather surprised by the almost raw burger put in front of me. \u00a0That being said, ambiance is good, service is quick and attentive and there are healthier options (like iceberg lettuce with blue cheese which really just strikes my fancy). \u00a0I'd say a good spot to bring visiting friends who may be pickier eaters. Drinks are also available across the range - from homemade lemonade, to craft beers, to some average to pretty good wine. Just be aware that ordering a number can get a bit pricey so hitting up on of the great local bars on Essex Road may be a better drinking option post-dinner (some of the better quality wines will get you at about 6/7 quid a drink).",

I've been disappointed at one too many a burger joint in London, however Byron always comes through.As for the ambiance, most of the Yelp reviews are spot on---this place is the epitome of industrial chic meets a construction site. The interior is purposely left incomplete---exposed rafters, lighting/wiring. When upper street was under construction late this winter, it was hard to tell where the street construction ended and Byron began! But now the sidewalks are nicely polished and construction free. There are 2 or so sidewalk tables you can snag to enjoy your burger outside.If you're in the mood for a damn good burger, there really is no better place on Upper Street.",

Coming from the states, it was definitely no In N Out burger (or even my favorite Santa Cruz local, Jack's). The price was a bit much for what you got as well. Pros: Onion rings were alright if a bit greasy. They had American mustard. I liked that they served the burger with a dill pickle on the side. I might go back. The blue cheese sauce had me intrigued. I wouldn't hurry back though. I'm not sure what the fascination with the place is, it really wasn't anything special.",

My cousin recommended Byron's because he said the hamburgers were good. Walked into a cutesy hamburger joint. Bf ordered the Byron (bacon, cheddar and Byron sauce) and I ordered the skinny (burger w/o the bun). We topped it off with an order of fries and strawberry shake.I remember the burgers being a bit tiny and the side of fries being really small. But we thought, maybe this is how much the rest of the world eats. Americans are just greedy and fat. =P The burgers were juicy. I don't really remember any of the flavors being unique or outstanding. The fries and shake were decent was well. Overall, an ok meal. Pricey though. Total came out to around 20 pounds.",

Friendly staff and very helpful. Brooklyn lager - reminisce about halcyon times in NY - so another plus point.

Aussie or Yank... what shall it be... Chips or fries...Down under you get sharp cheddar, beetroot, egg, bacon, carrot and avocado on your hamburger in addition to the usual lettuce tomato and oh of course beef.In the States however you get your decorative salad and seared patti smothered in spicy, smokey condiments vacuum-formed in viscus monterey-jack (this is a good thing if you were thinking it sounds like industrial manufacturing), it is also the only condition through which I will consume American cheese, and enjoy it.Quite pricey I have to say... but if you're going to spend the money on a burger, at least you'll enjoy it here. I can also recommend the frittered courgettes and the skins-on potatoes wedges as sides. Don't get a milkshake alongside your meal if you don't have a stomach the size of the Hoover Dam... they're extremely tasty but SO filling, as if the burger wasn't enough... I do find it hard to resist a root-beer-float though.Did not realise this was a franchise... that's a good thing right? I just love feeling like I'm sitting in the middle of a loft conversion upstairs... no really... a bit more gets completed every time I return. Can still see those floor boards though... oh wait that's the point. Have fun playing spot-the-cow figurines hidden about the place.Complaints- you don't get any sides included with your burger not even chips *gasp!*... which already costs around \u00a39 so it's not a cheap roadway diner..._** I can tell you it certainly ISN'T Byron as in Lord Byron as in the 18th century English poet who probably never consumed anything as so much related to a juicy, flavoursome hamburger in his life...",

I had been wanting to try Byron for years, and now that I went once I've actually been two other times since, at two other locations - each time I've been impressed!The burger is great. I had their Byron burger twice, and it was delicious. I order mine medium rare and the second time at Covent Garden they definitely over-cooked it to medium, and friends who just took theirs medium said theirs was a bit overcooked as well. The Angel branch didn't have this problem. Either way both the Byrons were great, and everyone I was with really enjoyed theirs as well.The third time I went was near Kensington and they had a special burger with crispy fried onions and barbecue sauce on top - I can't remember what it was called, but oh dear LORD was it good! I highly recommend it if you go and it's the special that day.Oh and DEFINITELY get their fried courgettes. I forgo their chips for them every time and I never regret it. I also really like their beer selection, lots of American beers to choose from as well as a couple Brewdog choices, and a few others.I like that each branch has their own atmosphere. It makes each restaurant feel unique even if the food is exactly the same. So far I probably do like Angel one the best for atmosphere, but I'm a bit of a hipster who likes that wood-dominated kinda run-down look. The Covent Garden one is a bit more posh looking though so probably good for a date night, and the Kensington branch is very white and modern. The service is always decent, never out of this world but never bad.Is it the best burger in London? No, not really. But if it can make a score of Americans happy, then it's a good pick. Just make sure to order your burger cooked slightly less well than you normally like it and you should be happy!",

I think it may have something to do with the fact that most of the burgers I have leave me a bit disappointed, I'm clearly not going to the right spots!The exception to this rule is Byron, which despite it's crazy expansion and generally boring everywhere-ness, really is that good. Shout out to the summer burger they have at the moment as well - the Sweet Caroline. Shoestring fries on my burger? Saves me the guilt of having to decide whether to order fries and oh so tasty to boot!The Islington outpost also has really great staff - the last couple times I've been in I've been very pleased with the friendlyness and care - they even charged my phone once - so yay to them.",

    "text": "When my family came to London to visit, my father noticed this place on the first night of his visit and made a mental bookmark to return. As requested, a few nights later we were in the mood for a quick dinner, close to the hotel. Byron seemed to fit the bill perfectly. Unfortunately, we were not impressed by the American style burgers. While I enjoyed the fixins on the burger I ordered, both my and my father's patties were woefully overcooked. The chips were floppy. My sister's salad was tasty but the quinoa was seriously undercooked and gritty. The waiter was slowslowslow and also somewhat snooty. He seemed frustrated that we only asked one order of chips and opted for tap water and nothing else to drink.All in all, the food wasn't horrific but it was definitely unremarkable and overpriced for what it was. With Five Guys across the street, I wouldn't come back.",

    "text": "I know, I know...Byron's burgers are the hype in London right now and I am very aware that I'm probably one of the few who actually didn't enjoy their dining-experince here. This Angel-Byron is really trying very hard to be cool; in my opinion, they've gone over-board with the currently all-so trendy \"unfinished look\": the walls are stripped barren, the cables are exposed and sitting on the upstairs gallery, you feel like you're in an attic or so. Granted, I like the unfnished look...but please keep it in moderation!As for the food, my burger was really just alright; nothing special. And the skin-on chunky fries were bland and lacked some salt (sure, I could add that, but they were so deep-fried that the salt didn't stick to them properly). I was also a little annoyed by the selection of wines. You could choose between: good, better, great and best. I mean, it is already nice that they want to help me with my decision-making, but I find it all to trivial, that the good one is the cheapest and the best one is the most expensive! All in all, my expectations were not met and I have no desire to try out any other Byron locations in the near future.",

    "text": "As an American, Byron is by far my favorite burger joint in London: their fries are perfectly skinny, they'll give me an extra pickle or two (if I ask nicely!), and the burgers are nothing fancy, just delicious. I don't need artisan buns or burgers stacked so high will fillings I can't wrap my mouth around ... Byron does away with all of this and just keeps things simple, which is why it's so (in my view) successful. I typically order the Byron cheeseburger with extra pickles (obvs) and fries. Staff are efficient and polite - I've never had a bad experience here. Quick turnover means that you don't have to wait long for a table. Highly recommended versus Five Guys just across the road.",

They have several different types of burgers, many of them unique - making it tough to make a decision. Their fries were good too.We came in to the Islington location, attracted by the unique faux-rundown interior. We later saw that they had several locations across the city.",

I ordered the Tempranillo, which was juicy and yummy with our tortilla chips and guac/salsa. I have to say this guacamole was really good!A few of us ordered the Byron burger and the Byron with bacon, which looked good. And a few of us ordered the seasonal Hot a Doodle do, a chicken marinated in hot sauce, with crispy onions and a pickle, which I loved. I did add some of cholula sauce at the table cuz I like my spicy. I would not recommend the regular chicken burger -- dry, and not chockful of veggies like I would have hoped. The sides we got were fries and Mac n cheese, both good. Service was great, a nice change from what we had all weekend. I will come back but not just that one chicken burger!",
