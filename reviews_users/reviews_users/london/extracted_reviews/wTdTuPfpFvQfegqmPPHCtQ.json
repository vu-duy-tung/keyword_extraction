I had just been for a beard trim in Liberty's then I whipped down Carnaby Street to this gorgeous little bar.I had a great holiday in Venice last year so as soon as I read about an authentic cicheti bar in Soho I just had to go! \u00a0It was packed to the rafters which was very pleasing because it was absolutely freezing outside.It is and it isn't authentic. Unlike cicheti in Venice it is expensive, but, the food is very good. We had a bottle of Prosecco which was excellent and the wine list looked fabulous.A great evening, \u00a0and looking forward to my next visit!",

    "text": "Polpo - Pics @ The London FoodieI thought there would be nothing else to add to the media frenzy surrounding \"Polpo\", the new Italian darling and makers of cicheti or small-eats, or tapas or whatever-you-wanna-call-it in Soho. It's been blogged and highly praised by just about every food blogger in London - but after my disappointing meal there last Saturday, I thought I would put pen to paper and dare to differ.First impressions were excellent - the d\u00e9cor was charming, the front-of-house staff very friendly and the place nearly full and buzzing with a beautiful and trendy crowd at 5:45pm. We started the evening by ordering a couple of their breads, \"White Bean Bruschetta\" @ \u00a34 and \"Wild Mushroom Piadina\" @ \u00a34.80, followed by a selection of \"cicheti and crostini\". The white beans had been cooked in rosemary and were very aromatic and perfectly al dente, a good Italian version of beans on toast. The \"Piadina\" was similar to a crepe and was filled with fried wild mushrooms. Both breads were nicely prepared although the portions were ludicrously small. We ordered two portions of each, and struggled to share them among the five of us.Our selection of \"cicheti and crostini\" included \"arancini\" @ \u00a31.50, \"anchovy & chick pea crostini\" @ \u00a31.10, \"potato and parmesan croquette\" @ \u00a31.20 and \"salt cod on grilled polenta\" @ \u00a32.10. I love Italian \"baccala\" (salted cod), and cook it frequently at home - I have made a similar dish of flaked salted cod with parsley, garlic and olive oil over grilled polenta a few times at home. These intensely flavoured ingredients should balance beautifully with the blander polenta, and when well made this dish is truly heavenly. Polpo's version however was very disappointing - the polenta was cold and soggy, and the salted cod completely tasteless. We ordered three pieces and we all agreed they were rather poor.The \"arancini\" were tiny and very uninspiring, and so were the \"anchovy & chick pea crostini\" and \"potato and parmesan croquettes\". I tried a bit of each, and struggle to find anything at all to say about them. Completely \"passable\" comes to mind.The more \"substantial\" meat and fish dishes that we ordered included \"Slow Roasted Duck\" @ \u00a36.10, \"Calves Liver, Onion and Sage\" @ \u00a35.90, \"Grilled Flank Steak with Mushroom\" @ \u00a36.90, and \"Fritto Misto\" @ \u00a36.60. We also ordered a portion of \"Pork Belly, Radicchio and Hazelnuts\" @ \u00a35.70 but it never turned up.Two of these dishes were good - the calves liver was well cooked, although not as delicately flavoured and soft as it should have been, while the \"fritto misto\" (deep fried whitebait and seafood) was crisp and utterly delicious.The flank steak was beautifully presented but in my opinion lacked seasoning, and the slow roasted duck was unexciting. It was served in a pool of tomato sauce and did not look terribly appetizing. All portions were very ungenerous.To accompany the above we also ordered a portion of \"Roast Potatoes and Rosemary\" @ \u00a33.70, \"Grilled Polenta\" @ \u00a33 and \"Fennel, Curly Endive and Almonds\" @ \u00a33.90. These were all well made and flavoursome, but again the portions were minute.For pudding, we had a few \"Affogato al caffe\" @ \u00a32.60 each (vanilla ice cream immersed in espresso coffee), \"Flourless Orange & Almond Cake\" @ \u00a34.40, and \"Honey & Walnut Semifreddo\" @ \u00a33.80. The affogato tasted just right - both the ice cream and the coffee were of high quality. The orange and almond cake was light and delicious, and I enjoyed it \u00a0immensely. I did not try the semifreddo but John seemed impressed with his choice.The wine list was impressive and reasonably priced, with bottles of white and red starting at \u00a315 through to \u00a338. Polpo serves most of its whites and a few reds in 250ml and 500ml measures at no extra cost. A bottle of 750ml will cost \u00a315 while 500ml & 250ml measures will cost \u00a310 and \u00a35 respectively. This is a nice thought, and the flat pricing structure should encourage wine drinkers to try different wine combinations to accompany their cicheti.My dinner companions were old friends from a wine club I used to belong to in Dulwich (Dulwich Wine Society), and therefore our wine choices were good but rather pricey. We had a couple of bottles of Gavi (white) @ \u00a330 each and two of Barbera (red) @ \u00a321 each. The total bill came to \u00a3208, including service, or \u00a342 per person. The general consensus was that it was a disappointing and expensive meal and some of us were still peckish at the end of it.Verdict - A clear example of style over substance. Good deep fried fish, good desserts, excellent wine list but tiny, ridiculously tiny portions. \u00a0Some of the dishes were seriously disappointing for a restaurant currently the subject of such hype. I am not planning a return visit.",

    "text": "FoodYUM! But small quantities. Arancini were thimble-sized instead of fist-sized. Don't go there if you're hungry. Really. Don't.And they don't bring you all the food in one shot so you can have the focaccia with, say, the beets. nono. They stagger the delivery and bring one or two dishes at a time, so the impression you get at the end of the meal (and during the meal) is that you haven't eaten much. PriceCame out to about \u00a335-40 per person with a glass of wine or a beer each, and a dessert each. Location, service, etc...Surprised that they don't take reservations, but they don't for dinner. So go early. Like 18:00. By 19:00 it's buzzing and people pass so close to the tables that they could spill your drinks if you leave them too close to the edge. Service is very helpful, but also rather busy, so allow plenty of time for getting your bill, especially if you're heading to a play or the cinema. AmbianceI love the decor of raw stone walls, wooden tables, and delicate lighting. However, the place gets insanely full very quickly, and the music gets so loud that I had to lean into the person next to me in order to hear them properly. It might've been just our table, but this was an eminently clubby volume.",

    "text": "Went here for dinner last night with my boyfriend. I was worried that the wait would be ridiculous on a Saturday night, but we were there early-ish (about 7), so the wait was only about 5 mins. We got some delicious Moscow Mules from the bar while we waited, and then we were led to our table at the back.The waitress recommended we go with 3 mains, a veg and some starters/breads. We ended up ordering 4 mains and it turns out our waitress was right. The flank steak, cod cheeks, meatballs and lamb were all delicious and cooked perfectly. The heritage tomatoes were good, but probably not worth \u00a35 for a plate of tomatoes. Our favorite dishes were probably the flank steak, cod cheeks and arancini, which were hot, gooey and cheesy.",

    "text": "I had high hopes from the moment this place opened its doors, only working a block away. We strolled in yesterday at about 1pm without a reservation and were offered a seat at the bar.The menu was appetising, and we ordered quickly as we didn't have long. Our drinks arrived straight away and our first order (Polenta topped with Salt Cod) came within 5 minutes. The creamed cod was really tasty but unfortunately the Polenta really let the side down being cold, damp and sweet. I suspect it would have been lovely had the polenta been crispy and hot. Also it was only one rather small piece.Our Tapenade & Tomato Pizette arrived another 5 minutes later, hot crispy and tasty. It was nice but nothing to scream about.We were already halfway through our beers at this point when the food simply stopped coming. We'd probably had 50g of food each and both looked around confused and food kept arriving but nowhere nearby enough to eat. 30+ minutes later we had chased and cajoled and though the staff seemed to be looking into it and promising us of food shortly to arrive nothing did. They were all very sweet and obliging but this didn't seem to help expedite our food.So after almost an hour we'd had a beer each and 75g of food and we cancelled our order to go to the sandwich bar next door. They initially intended to charge for our two tiny pieces of food and beers, though whilst we were in the midst of paying, the manager came over and apologised for the wait and said there would be no need to pay. This was definitely a saving grace on their part, had they not said that the tone of this review would have been much harsher and I would have definitely not returned.All this said; the sweet staff, tasty food (what we received), & nice ambience will make me go back again. I'd really like to experience what all those food reviewers loved so much; surely Giles Coren can't be wrong...3/10 : Definitely some overdue homework",

    "text": "Please refer to my blog for pictures and more: hungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  Polpo is the first restaurant which, since I have started this blog, needs to be marked down because of its toilet. I have never seen a toilet that disgusting in a place that is not a boys only student flat share. I will describe all the ghastly details later, but before you completely lose your appetite I shall talk about the food first. Polpo serves tapas-style Italian and this is just such a great idea. Nothing is above 10 pounds and the idea is to order loads of small dishes and share. This is paradise for someone like me who needs to try everything. Not only most food bloggers love this place and I thought the food was decent and the atmosphere was very pleasant. While drinking the cheap and nice enough house red, plates of delicious looking food were carried past us. The staff was lovely and efficient and we got a big bottle of tab water ( I just learn to appreciate this more and more). We started our meal by trying a few of the crostini. We wanted one of each but the waiter pointed out that they were very small and we ended up ordering two of each. In the end they were not that small after all and we wasted already half of our appetite on bread which was a shame really. The best probably was the salmon, dill and horseradish crostini (2 each). The anchovy and chickpea crostini (1 each) was interesting and not unpleasant at all. The least successful were the chicken liver crostini (1.5 each). I love the Italian chicken liver pate usually, but this one was under-seasoned and bland. Even though I would have wanted the bread to be a bit thinner, this is a really nice snack with a glass of wine. Spinach, parmesan and soft egg pizetta (5.5) was enjoyable but did not rock my world. I would not necessarily order it again, although I rather enjoyed the crisp dough and the well seasoned spinach. An absolute winner was the beetroot with rocket and walnut pesto (5). The sweetness of the beetroot, the bitterness of the rocket and the small pieces of walnuts were such a delicious combination that we regretted at this point that we were sharing We all enjoyed the Mackerel Tartare with Horseradish (6). The mackerel tasted almost like ceviche, marinated in lemon juice until cooked through the acid. The horseradish was a bit too creamy for my taste, but nevertheless a lovely dish. Strozzapreti with duck ragu were very nice too. The pasta which was obviously home-made was cooked exactly the way I like it, perfectly al dente and the ragu was well balanced. I would actually quite liked to have some parmesan with it, but we did not get any offered and when the waiter came past next we had already finished. One criticism however \u00a0the dish was lukewarm when it was served. How good would it have been actually hot! I love the fact that Polpo serves some small desserts. We tried the ricotta and chocolate crumble (2.50) \u00a0two pieces of cake just enough to satisfy our urge for something sweet after dinner. Unfortunately however the cake was disappointing. Too dry and you could neither taste the chocolate nor the ricotta very much. More successful was the Sgroppino (4.5) . Nice place, nice (although not amazing) food and then the toilet. I should have made a picture, but I was so shocked, so please forgive me the lack of photographic evidence. No toilet paper in any of the two cubicles. On the toilet seat were several spots of dried-up urine and on the floor were stains that might have been crusted remnants of vomitus. The wash basin looked like it had not been cleaned for weeks. Stains and dust and dirty glasses everywhere. This is the state of a toilet you would expect in a student nightclub at 6 in the morning, not at a fancy restaurant at 6 in the evening. I usually don't bother too much about toilets, but this was too much and reduced my otherwise pleasant experience at Polpo.",

    "text": "It's not often that I find myself going to a restaurant in London twice in quick succession but the quality of the food, the ambience and the lovely staff had me dragging B back for a cheeky Sunday lunch after a lovely mid-week dinner. I had been meaning to give Polpo a try for some time but being an impatient kind of guy on the couple of occasions I rocked up around 8pm I could never be bothered to wait the estimated hour or so for a table (no bookings in the evening) so usually ended up in the nearby branch of Brindisa. However, I finally decided to get my act together and turned up on a Wednesday evening at 5.45 and we pretty much had a choice of all the tables or bar seats. However, be warned there was not a table to be had by 6.30!! We grabbed a table in the restaurant, got ourselves an Aperol and a Campari Spritz, and set about studying the beautifully constructed menu which doubles as your place mat. For a grazing fella such as myself these Italian (well, Venetian) small plate menus are just a joy and allow the palate to get a good run out. The staff on both occasions I have eaten here have been brilliant - laid back, friendly yet very professional. They will generally recommend around 5 plates between two but my personal preference is to break it up and have three plates, see where that takes your taste buds and then order another two or perhaps three plates if you are really hungry. The staff will find this no problem and may even complement you on your desire to get the best out of what Polpo has to offer. This approach also has the advantage of giving you a bit of space to work with on the somewhat small tables. So to the food: start with a couple of nibbles to go with your aperitifo. The parmesan and potato croquettes are delicious as are the smoked salmon and horseradish crostino. I would advise caution with bread selection which is fantastic but you don't want to blow up before you have even really begun. Having said that the spinach and egg pizzetta and the crostini are both to die for!! In fact every dish I have eaten here has been pretty damn fine but stand outs are the prawns with chick peas, spaghetti with clams, the meat-balls, broccoli with anchovies and of course the roasted squash with prosciutto. I have to confess I have not had the appetite to make it to the dolce but the selection looks good and from what I saw on the surrounding tables was going down very well. Wine selection was short, well edited and for London fairly reasonably priced. The house white was fine and was available by the 1/4 litre for a fiver. Coffee was as good as you would expect and tap water was served chilled by the bottle. The crowd seem to be a mixture of foodie locals with a good dose of in the know tourists. Very popular with the late 20's and thirtysomething types and all great for people watching. Very few children running free just makes it all so much better!! On our return for some Sunday snackage we arrived at 1pm without booking and managed to secure a couple of seats at the bar on the right as you enter - top notch position for people watching with plenty of space and fairly cozy if you are in a romantic mood. I was particularly impressed with our barmaid who was very friendly, helpful and had impeccable music taste - it's been a long time since I have heard the Slits sounding so good with a Sunday lunch. We left to meet our old friends the Duncan clan from the Granite City in the Old Coffee Shop Pub a couple of doors down the road well fed and in great spirits - many thanks Polpo. All things considered this would be one of my top recommendations if you happen to be in central London and want to eat some great food at very reasonable prices. Book your lunch spot now!!",

    "text": "Tapas. Mmm, what springs to mind? Overpriced tip-bits of meat, cheese and olives in little bowls in somewhere called La Taskmaster. But wait, this is ITALIAN tapas. Just like the people who in the 1980s thought pasta was boring and now have their own pasta machine and mile high pepper grinder, I have been converted to Tapas. If someone is going to serve little tip-bits of food in a selection so everyone can share they need to be a) super tasty b) adventurous. Every time I go to Polpo they get this just right: I've never really heard of any of the dishes and they are deeelicious. It gets fairly busy in here but ring a few hours before to book a table, and you should be fine. They do manage to cram people in but the atmosphere is great, the staff are friendly and efficient, and it's not so pricey. And it's Soho! If you're a Tapas cynic like me, free your mind and try Polpo. And make sure you pick out some random dishes from the menu - as some others have mentioned the cuttlefish in it's own ink is brilliant!",

The arancini, made with rice, peas and mozzarella are nice while their croquette cousins are a bit bland, but the batter for both is excellent. The mackerel on polenta - tasteless and greasy. The fritto misto - avoid; it's surprisingly devoid of flavour, limp and seems to have been fried well before being served. The cuttlefish with ink gremolata is unusual and tasty as is the pizzetta bianca. The pork belly with hazel nuts and radicchio is attractively presented and adequately flavourful. So ... choose your cichetto wisely and a satisfactory dining experience may be had but stay away from that fritto misto!",

We should have known that there was a problem when part of our order was served within five minutes. \u00a0It's hard to believe that something that is supposed to be cooked to order would be prepared so quickly. There was nothing unique in any way on the menu. The only dish that seemed to be authentic was the Cod, but even that was unremarkable. \u00a0In fact, the pork belly was unfit to eat. \u00a0All fat, no crispy skin or meat and a flavor that was borderline rancid. \u00a0Another couple next to us had ordered the same and we checked to see if theirs had been any better. \u00a0When their plates were removed, they had eaten about the same as us: \u00a0practically nothing, after searching in vain for something redeeming.Contrary to other reviews, we thought the service was just fine. The hostess was very pleasant and helpful when we asked about making reservations the day before. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very informative and attentive.If you are a tourist looking for a great local restaurant in Polpo, you will surely be disappointed. \u00a0Keep looking because there are many more places worth your appetite and business.",

    "text": "One of my favourite places. The tapas-style, Italian home cooking in a casual environment can be the perfect antidote to a rainy day. The only criticism I have is that it is always packed and the wait can be long, but then bookings are taken so I'm being unreasonable. I just want to be able to turn up and pig out, and I can't do that because Polpo is so popular. But the more form-fitting items in my wardrobe are grateful. Also the dessert portions are quite small. But again, my wardrobe thanks the gods who deigned to spare it further undue stretching. The decor is perfect: Part French cafe, part industrial chic and clearly Italian. The naked lightbulbs create a warming effect to soften the translucent skylight in the ceiling. Tables are staffed with plain glassware and paper menus. Staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Speaking of which, my favourites off the current menu are the strozzapretti in dug ragu (beautifully cooked duck in a green peppercorn sauce) and the fig/walnut/goat cheese/honey brucschetta. Simple, yet each ingredient is perfectly toasted/roasted/seasoned/combined. The wine list is limited but reasonably priced. If you like to eat like I do, then beware that a plate here and a plate there can add up (if you, like me, lack self restraint in the face of deliciousness).",

    "text": "Italian Tapas? I was confused. Why, I asked myself, would I want to eat little bits of pizza when I could just eat a 12\" bad boy from Domino's? I blame my English state education; Italian - that's spaghetti innit? Well, as Polpo more than adequately taught me, it aint all pizza (blud). From cuttlefish cooked in its own ink (I hadn't previously realised this was possible!) to slow roast duck, Polpo gave me a schooling in what proper Italian food is all about. The restaurant itself, kind of a nouveau rustic feel, was cosy and atmospheric, without feeling overdone or cramped, and the service attentive and prompt. Polpo also seems to have achieved the impressive feat of being equally at home catering for business lunches, groups of friends, or romantic couples. Lastly I have to second Andrew's recommendation. If you have time for a pint after dinner, check out the Old Coffee House (qype.co.uk/place/77147-T\u2026)",

When we arrived, the table - despite the place being packed up to the limit - was still available and seated 7 just fine (round table, so much more convenient for larger groups). We ordered each one a starter and everything on the main menu to give us the full experience - and we weren't disappointed! The dishes and drinks were served quite fast (given the full restaurant) and I wouldn't be able to choose which one was my favourite....all of them did taste great and had something special to it! Included in our \"everything-from-the-menue\" experience was squid in its own ink, mussels & clams, octopus salad, pork belly, fennel salad, meatballs (polpette), cured meats and so many more dishes, mostly around 5-6 pounds for a main, starters around 1-2 pounds. Definitely a place to go if you want to have good food in a bustling place....don't try to do a quiet and calm night out there!",

The tapas bathed in soft light from the Edison bulbs and the tin ceiling tiles make the decor very cosy, romantic, hipster.

The steak and mushrooms were pretty tasty. However its namesake octopus salad was pretty mediocre. \u00a0Overall great for an incredible ambiance and the food is not bad.",

    "text": "Polpo is most decidedly not a pizza place (desite the annoying Qype designation which forces it into the same category as the awful Pizza Express), and is extremely reasonably priced for such high quality food. They specialise in small dishes of the type found in the Venetian countryside (if that isn't impossible) - but more substantial than tapas. In fact we left the choice of food entirely to the owner/manager Russell Norman who russelled up 16 different dishes between the four of us and they were delicious, though as we also had two bottles of wine (a great Gavi di Gavi and an excellent Lacrima Morro d'Alba) and with only three of us drinking them (the other was on whisky....) our concentration became somewhat impaired. Despite only having opened two weeks ago, service was terrific - friendly without people rushing up saying 'is it ok?' every few minutes, and the atmosphere in the old Soho house (once lived in by Canaletto) was warm and cosy, and packed to the rafters with smart young things. Food came to \u00a395 for four (the less said about our bar bill the better) and was great value for such a fun evening. Russell Norman has harnessed the power of the blogosphere to promote his restaurant and twitters amusingly about it. He is thus one of the first to tweet about his customers instead of the other way round. No doubt it will be a point of honour to get a mention in his nightly postings.",

Polpo is certainly very good but just doesn't quite match the same standards. Admittedly the dishes are cheaper but also not quite as plentiful.The real acid test for me was the seafood linguine. Both restaurants use the same brand of dried linguine but whereas Bocca was sublime with perfectly al dente pasta, Polpo's pasta was slightly overcooked and just nowhere near as tasty.You also have to worry about a restaurant when there is a dish on the menu that the waitress very strongly recommends you to avoid. Here it is the chocolate and orange salami. \u00a0We were advised under no circumstances to order it. Whether it is actually good or not becomes irrelevant. If a restaurant has a dish on the menu that the staff dislike that much then there has to be some problem going on.The saving grace of this place is the friendliness of the staff. They made good recommendations on the dishes, although to the frustration of the chef they were occasionally slow getting dishes out.I suspect that if I went on a less busy night with a slightly less noisy atmosphere I might enjoy this place more, but when you consider that for just a little more money Bocca di Lupo is a 5 minute walk away it'll be hard bringing myself back.",

    "text": "A firm favourite of mine, and the rest of London so it seems. It's success has a lot to do with the restaurant's savvy use of Twitter as a self-promotion tool (check them out at @PolpoSoho), but even more to do with fabulous food and a gorgeous atmosphere to boot.I was first taken here by the lovely Mel Seasons (fakeplasticnoodles.com) for lunch, and one of our group was vegetarian. We perused the tapas-style menu of Italian cicheti (which just means small portions) and small plates. Our waiter was great, explaining the dishes and ordering format (plates come out as they're ready unless you state otherwise). Both meat-eaters and plant lovers alike had a great meal. I fell back in love with polenta (grilled), which I'd previously marked down for being bland. The mini pizza was divine, and the spinach with chili was delicious.Since then, I've been back and back. Friends love it, colleagues love it. Every single person I've taken there has had fun. It's got a great atmosphere (the 18th century building it's housed in used to belong to Caneletto, famous for his paintings of Venice), and it just calls out for afternoons of red wine, espresso and chatter.Don't be put off by the crowd at the front door, it can be misleading as people sometimes crush in to drink at the bar. I haven't ever actually had to wait for a table there. Though, it only sits 55, so pick your times carefully.Prices are pretty good for the quality of food you get. Though the cicheti and crostini itself are priced per portion (\u00a31.20 upwards), so make sure you order per person. The rest are smaller dishes, so can be shared. Wine is average cost for London, and the cocktails - which come in Italian style glass cups - start from \u00a35.Polpo also has a good sized private room for lunches or dinners, that can seat 30. I haven't been in there yet, but I'm thinking about booking it for my birthday!",

Must say that it was a slight dissapointement.I love italian food but somehow the menu felt forced and could not really find anything I fancied.In the end the meatballs, risotto side and chocolate salami dessert were very good.The thing you should not come for here is pasta, but on the other hand the ambiance is very good and it's not too expensive. Perfectly suited for sharing a bottle of wine and some nibbles.I'd recommend it for sure - but it's not as fantastic as I've read here and there.",

Unfortunately as its so cramped its like i am sharing my meal with fellow diners and its awkward to leave your table when finished.If you are looking for good food and dont mind the wait or cramped conditions then this is the place for you, as for me i want to go back and order the polpettes",

Especially when we were presented with the menu. Eyes as big as saucers, we soon were tucking into apricot and sage rabbit terrine, prosciutto with buffalo mozzarella, and the most amazing pizzetta bianca I've ever indulged in. We then ordered six more dishes... and bread... and dessert... and ohmyGOD it was so good. All of it. So good. \u00a0The 45 minute wait went by in a flash due to the sassy bartenders, stiff cocktails and seats at the bar. Match that with the atmosphere that I mentioned in my previous review, and this place is just an overall win.Go with your fellow foodies and sample your heart out!",

    "text": "I'm also surprised this place hasn't received higher ratings, like its sister restaurants in other parts of London have. I went here last night for a friend, and had a really nice experience. We waited about half an hour for a table, but got drinks at the bar first. They had a really, really excellent dark and stormy (\u00a37). The rum was Havana Club, a sort of forbidden fruit for us Americans with our dumb Cuban embargo. I have had a lot of dark and stormies, and this was honestly the best I'd ever had. Not too much ice, so it wasn't watered down after five minutes. When we were seated, we ordered a bottle of wine and a number of the small plates. My nominal knowledge is only of California wine (of which there is absolutely none in London, it seems), so I moved on to the next best thing for me, and picked a barbera (\u00a325). Their wine list is small, but apparently carefully chosen as the wine was really nice, smooth, and fruity. A good red to accompany relatively light dishes. We ordered the:- Arancini (just OK -- I'm not a fan of the concept generally)- Chopped chicken liver crostino (absolutely yummy -- almost like a pate or something)- Goat cheese, roasted grape, pine nut, honey crostini (a MUST have!)- Lamb and pistachio meatballs (solid, but not memorable)- Calamari and radish salid (solid, but not memorable)- Chili and garlic prawns (another must have -- super flavorful, a good amount of chili and spice!)- Tirimisu pot (to split -- very nice). The reasons it receives four stars instead of five are 1) somewhat inattentive and mediocre service (the downside of a no tipping culture), and 2) a few dishes that were \"just OK\" as opposed to really standing out. Wow, looking at that list, what an alcoholic/fat kid night we had. But everything was very tasty, and I'd definitely go back. The bill was ~\u00a345/person inclusive, so not cheap at all, but not a bad value given the quality of the meal. I've had some terrible food in London, and this was a very nice change fromm that.",

Only reason I mark them down is the service isn't a good as I would have liked, but the food mostly made up for it.Arrived with no reservation - 45 minute wait in the bar downstairs. Got a bit worried when those who arrived after us started getting seated so asked what happened and were seating pretty promptly at the bar. Bar is fine for eating and if anything probably a bit faster so not something to snub your nose at.We ordered 7 things - this was WAY too much. Didn't even get close to finishing.RECOMMEND in order of preference:Goat cheese, roasted grape & honey bruschettaCured pork shoulder & pickled pepperAranciniVeal & porcini meatballsCauliflower & Fontina gratinDO NOT recommend:Cod cheeks and lentils - I really didn't like this. Unless you love lentils a lot I wouldn't get it.Duck Papardele - this was actually OK but really needed salt. House wine is good too. Would definitely go back as there are more things I would love to try.",

There's a very serious negroni being made down there and it's amazing how a few of them can make the time fly by.When we made it upstairs we had the polpette, cod cheeks, spinach and egg pizzette, some grilled polenta and the brussel tops.

    "text": "Small plate dining, associated with the tapas of Spain and the mezze of Greece and Turkey, appear all over the region. The less known Venetian equivalent, chicchetti, have many similarities. Combinations of meat, fish and vegetables, often served with bread or polenta. Can't go wrong. In the past few years, alongside several excellent new Spanish joints, we've also been lucky enough to welcome both Bocca di Lupo and Polpo to Soho. The latter, a buzzy little place on Beak Street, was opened by Russell Norman (ex Caprice Holdings) to solid reviews and even more solid word of mouth. A strict no bookings policy at this 'locals' restaurant led to regular queues down the street once the word had spread. He's just done it again too, with Polpetto, a beautiful little matchbox above the French House.  Decorwise, it's got that Soho House style shabby chic look down to pat. low light from bare bulbs and simple furniture bely the thought that has gone into the joint. The staff are friendly and surprisingly relaxed considering the unruly mash of drinkers and diners crammed into their tiny bar space. A smatter of seats aside the bar are the best in the house, keeping you cozily ensconced in the amiable bar crowd. It's not a place for the shrinking violet. The Literary Lady and I are certainly no violets but we struggled to make ourselves heard at times. Like little brother Polpetto, this is definitely somewhere to come and meet and mingle and if you grab a bite, then it's a result. The atmosphere is key to the experience.  But what of the food? There was a fair amount of it that grabbed us on the throwaway paper menus, and plenty of tasty morsels certain to soak up a lovely big Sagiovese, well priced for house at \u00a316.50. We went for five plates to start and added another two on at the end, greedily tempted by a neighbouring order. Garlicky mushrooms served in a rather dry flatbread was so-so tasty, but no more than you'd expect from a student dinner party. For me, a duff note came with another student standby, sparse handful of garlic prawns, part shelled, in an insipid tomato and bean sauce. More positive notes came with thick slices of pork belly, tenderly braised and meltingly sweet with hazelnuts and the edge of radicchio. Mackerel tartare is a favourite on the menu, winter and summer, cut through with a horseradish cream, it's a pleasing combination and provides contrast to the meatier dishes. Their polpetta, gamey and (slightly too) salty meatballs are great winter beer fodder but not too sophisticated. The duck ragu was another welcome winter warmer, served with wormlike fingers of strozzapetti pasta and the bite of green peppercorns. Not 'posh nosh' as such, but simple and pleasing.",

A little while later it was joined by Polpetto (also in Soho), situated above The French House on Dean Street.Inspired by the osterie of Venice both continue to serve rustic food and aperitifs that you would expect to find in Italy - simple, good food and drink - plus a great bustling atmosphere that promises to bring a ray of light to dull winter days.For prices - Just as 1/3 and that will convert to AUD$Look how cheap it is!Sitting at the bar at Polpo a few years later, we were reminded of how much we have missed a proper plate of tapas-style food. Melbourne, and Australia in general, thinks it knows how to do rustic Euro fare, but too much effort and too many flourishes often lead to stripped back yet over-complicated food. And really, if the ingredients and flavour combinations are good, the dazzle should come naturally.Bare walls, small seating area, patrons dining at the bar, no fuss and no modern design. We sipped an Old Fashioned and 250ml carafe of red wine.......and nibbled on anchovy and chickpea crostini, roast pumpkin, parma ham and ricotta salata and pork belly, radicchio and hazelnut soaking in a tasty gravy.As hard as it was to walk away from the intimate interior (I had my eyes set on a bit of an all-day drinking session), we stumbled on to the Jewish deli opened (by the same group) at the end of 2011 to rapturous excitement.Follow: @shark4fishchip",

    "text": "Oh Polpo, I wanted so much more from you. I got the gist of things: a trendy joint serving Greek-leaning Mediterranean food in tapas portions with good ingredients.I was expecting clean flavours, a focus on top-notch ingredients, and simple food, simply presented so that the individual components could shine.Alas, not so much.All our dishes fell into the category of bland to the point of sadness. I'm all for not messing up a stellar ingredient, but the ingredients weren't stellar: if you want to not season your fennel at all, you best be sure that fennel is at its prime, that your olive oil is brilliantly flavourful, that the cheese you grate over it has presence. Otherwise you end up with a sad, vaguely fennel-y plate of tough white greenage and pale, oily disappointment.The mixed fried seafood dish wasn't seasoned, either: the batter was clunky, the whitebait overwhelmed the other components, and it all cried for a bit of salt, at the very least.I think it's a bit sad but telling that I can't actually recall what else we had, even though we had about seven dishes in all. That's seriously underwhelming.The one dish that did stand out, for the wrong reasons, was the sliced steak salad: contrary to the \"thou shalt not touch thine spice rack\", this was salted to the point of being inedible.Overall, we left feeling as though we'd dropped far too much money on bland, uninspired tapas composed of bland, flavourless ingredients. What a waste of a good concept.",

The food is absolutely delectable, especially the unforgettable Arancini (so good I purchased the Polpo cookbook solely just to have this recipe). The atmosphere is effortlessly fun and the place never fails to excite. However, on more than one occasion after work it has failed us to get a table. The restaurant (like many now in London adhering to this trend) works on a first-come-first served basis hence during the dinner rush this could mean an hour plus wait for a table. However when you do nab one the service, food and ambience are first class.",

The downstairs bar waiting area was understaffed, so we only managed to have one round, despite being there almost an hour. The menu has a good range, although it would be great if they could indicate vegetarian options. The fritto misto definitely needs some sort of sauce, although dips could make a nice improvement for most of the small plates. Staffing problems continued upstairs. Despite asking to order more plates, the waitress never returned and the table was bussed, essentially preventing us ordering more food. Dessert spoons were in very short supply, and the bill was a challenge to get!",

This suited us fine, and so we took our pews and scanned through the medium sized menu.I think there were probably more options on the cocktail menu than the food menu! I opted for a refreshing, and strong elderflower martini. It packed a punch and was delightful. Just what I needed on a Thursday evening.The idea of this Venetian style of dining is to pick 2-3 small plates each and share. We opted for veal and porchini meatballs, a lamb dish, goats cheese and salami calzone, a courgette and rocket dish (the waiter recommended we have some veg!), and clam linguine.The calzone was amazing. I don't ever have pizza, but the combination of the goats cheese and salami was great! The clam linguine was as good as any I've had in Italy, the lamb very tender and the meat balls were tasty too.All in all a very good dining experience.The staff were friendly, the bar tender very helpful when we were asking about the number of dishes we should have. The large bottle of tap water served as soon as we sat down was most welcomed. The buzz in the restaurant was nice, busy but not so noisy that you couldn't hear your date. Low level lighting creating a cool evening atmosphere.As we left we noticed a few people queuing outside, so if you're planning on eating there, try and get there early.We paid about \u00a345 for 5 dishes and 2 cocktails. It was more than enough food and the cocktails were strong and delicious.A very nice place to eat!",

We were a table of four and chose to share around six dishes, which we initially thought mightn't be enough, however we ended up having to walk off our lunch in Hyde Park later!They are famous for their meat balls and I can totally see why. We ordered the classic and the spicy pork and fennel which were outstanding. Paired with a salad of rocket and courgette, cold meats with mozzarella and watercress, a selection of the tasting plates and a pizzette we had more than enough to eat.The staff are fantastic and the decor is perfection. I'll definitely be stopping here again.Do make sure you make a reservation as they are extremely busy, we waited half an hour, but chose to have a wander around Liberty while we waited.",

It ended up looking and tasting like fried mozarella cheese sticks, so although it wasn't exactly what we were expecting, it was still delicious. The house red wine was also tasty and reasonably priced. My friends definitely plan on going back, and if I weren't just passing through, I'm sure I'd do the same.",

The ambience is great, the atmosphere is nice, the service is quick and friendly, but the food - awful. We ordered 5 plates of food (it's essentially a tapas place so you'll have to mix and match) and by the end of it, the waiters collected 4 plates of half finished meals. The focaccia bread was the saltiest thing I've had in years, the market greens turned out to be a plate of boiled kale (in its defence, the kale was lovely while it was warm), prawn tagliatelle was swimming in fat and the risotto had peas so minty that it was inedible. What upsets me the most is not the fact we bought five plates of below mediocre food, but the fact I've been planning on going there for ages and when the opportunity presented itself (Polpo was still open at 10.30pm), it was an utter disappointment.Soho offers everything and anything a foodie could ask for, but sadly, Polpo is not what a foodie would want. If you're after Italian-esque tapas, check out Sountino instead.",

I cannot argue the quality. I read in some reviews that people complain about food being bland. I cannot completely agree to that. I myself greatly enjoy spicy food and a good mix of seasoning. But Polpo just does minimal seasoning. That is a style and it is made with lots of thought. The meat had a great taste and needed only a minimal amount of salt and herbs. It played out very well. The orange almond cake made a great impression on me. I loved it very much. If the food was so good, why not at least one more star? I am surprised that this is supposed to be a rare food experience in London? Are there not a good dozen more Italian restaurants, who can deliver that quality? There is a hype that creates a crowd of waiting people. And the place probably does not deserve that much hype.",

The cichettis are so tasty - my favourites are the chickpea/anchovy and chicken liver crostinis. If you don't like anchovies, I definitely wouldn't recommend ordering it because the smell and taste of it is quite strong! The fritto misto is another favourite of mine - fried but not greasy selection of calamari, fish, octopus etc...yum! The spinach/parmesan/poached egg pizzette is sooooo good - probably my favourite dish \u00a0from Polpo. The meatballs are also very good. For dessert I'd highly recommend the ricotta/chocolate crumble - super rich but delicious.Service is friendly and prompt. Polpo's a perfect night out with friends for a quick bite or a casual dinner...not to mention they have a good selection of cocktails/wine! Only down side is that it gets very very busy so I find myself having to eat early if I don't want to queue (and why I hesitate to give it 5 stars). They do take bookings for lunch though which is a consolation!",

The no-res policy is just stupid, btw. What year is this? The bar staff downstairs was delightful, as were the cocktails - best part of the evening.The folks running the front of house are amateurs - plain and simple. They didn't ask how they could make it up to us or offer even a free drink or dessert to make up for the painfully long wait. Instead they chose to rush us our food minutes after we ordered... we had no time to savor the wine before every plate hit the table at once. Sloppy service, indeed. The food was fine. The duck ragu, fennel salad, classic meatballs were all solid. The pork belly was dry and uninteresting. We ordered the fried olives but like our server they never appeared at the table... The standouts oddly were the grilled bread and mini canolli. I'd go back for the Campari bar and the delightful folks and drinks but would pass on the dining room Bocca Di Lupo is a far better choice for food.",

This ambiance is great, that of a happening, busy, and hip wine bar and tapas joint. The Gin Fizz I had was ok.. a bit medicinal tasting but hey after a couple sips I stopped caring so much. My friend and I shared a few plates:*Braised* Scallops, pancetta and Peas under the fish section. - here's a definition of \u00a0braised, brais*ing.to cook (meat, fish, or vegetables) by saut\u00e9eing in fat and then simmering in a small amount of liquid in a covered pot. \u00a0They do not know the meaning of Braise AT ALL. What we got was a soup. When I asked the server about this dish, and that i was expecting NOT a soup he said.. yeah, thats just how they serve it here. -Prawn & Asparagus risotto. It was decent, subtle and tasting of the sea. -The Calfs Liver and Onions and Sage.- Sage? What sage. The Calfs liver was ok, mineral tasting, and actually our least favorite dish. The onions were nicely saut\u00e9ed and sweet. -The Goat cheese & Nettle pesto Piadina was BOMB. HOLY SHIT GOOD. Freshly baked bread with a thick schmear of goats cheese in the center topped with a deliciously garlicky pesto paste. It was the highlight of the meal. Desserts- The Amalfi Lemon and Yoghurt Fool - Delicous. Simple yoghurt dish with crunchy sweet biscuits crumbled on top and hidden at the bottom. - Flourless orange and almond cake - gorgeous cake smothered in a rich sweet sauce topped with candied orange slices. So, why do i think its perfect for a date. Because you won't want to stuff yourself first off, you have a wide array of drink possibilites to lubricate conversation and the desserts are great!",

She also said they would come out whenever they were ready, instead of all at once.We ordered the risotto balls--these were fried and cheesy inside but very small! We then got the beef meatballs in sauce. These were about four meatballs in a red sauce. They were tasty but not outstanding. We then got the broccoli with hazelnuts. The broccoli was a bit under-cooked and didn't have enough flavor.The service at this restaurant was a bit confusing. It seems the servers help all the tables, instead of being assigned specific parties. We asked four servers for our check and kept waiting for it to arrive! It was very odd and we couldn't understand why this took so long after so many people asked us if we wanted anything else.I would say the price and ambiance here doesn't match the quality and service. Very underwhelming.",

But as Polpo is highly recommended in the travel guides we gave it another try and came back for dinner the following evening. The food was ok but nothing more. I had a gorgonzola/ham Pizza and it didn't contain gorgonzola at all. It was loaded with much to much cheese but not with the one announced. The Radicchio/Sellery/Apple/Pecorino Salad was much to sour (I think the dressing was just vineagar) and the Pecorino was arranged like Gold Dust (Nearly not existing). The wine wasn't good at all. There are better places to eat in London!",

It's easy to get carried away with one of everything (and then one or two extra when you find something you like). A friend and I shared a variety of small plates. They recommend 2-3 per person. The arancini were my favorite - unbelievably creamy inside a golden crust. I also loved the meatballs \"alla Vedova\" which were rolled in polenta (no sauce). \u00a0The regular meatballs in marinara were flavorful. Even the bread was delicious - coated in olive oil, grilled, and dusted with sea salt. The special du jour risotto with rocket was WAY too salty. I could have skipped the mushroom piadina. We tried a few of the mixed drinks and they were great. The gin fizz was a sweet mix of gin and prosecco. And the dark and stormy used a spicy ginger beer. This is one of a few locations in London. I'll definitely be back next time I'm the city.",

    "text": "Heard lots of great buzz around this place but don't think it quite lives up to the hype. It has potential but there is a lot of places I would go first. The downstairs bar that you can wait in is a great idea especially as this is a 'no bookings' restaurant. You can order starters down here but the starters aren't too flash. We ordered the crab arancini and stuffed olives. They came out on the same plate: no garnish, no sauces, no love (see my picture). The olives tasted ok.When we were taken upstairs for our table we sat at our table for 30mins before getting even a menu. We weren't in a hurry so we would have preferred to stay downstairs and get our own drinks. We ended up grabbing the drinks menu for ourselves (and we also grabbed water for ourselves too) Anyway bad service. A lot of attitude coming from staff. We were a whole table of hospitality people so always understand if it's busy but they were plain disinterested in service and more interested chatting to themselves. We ordered drinks. Then some more sharing things and some medium plates which all seemed to come out at once. And the wine came out after the food (I think they forgot to put our order in). Again simple apology or sincerity would have been fine but we inconvenienced the waitress by asking her twice. The octopus was lovely. A little cold but tasty. The mackerel tartare turned out to be salmon, not fresh. I can't remember the other dish we ordered but whatever it was supposed to be was over powered with a lot of olive tapenade and mustard on very very stale bread that we couldn't cut through. There was also some soggy deep-fried fish. At that point we asked for the bill and we to a much better place around the corner. So yeah go to a lovely french place around the corner.",

I don't mean tiny for Italian standards (I know we can overreact on our portions sometimes...), I mean tiny for French standards. To make it clearer: I have paid 4 pounds for the stuffed olives portion. A portion comprised of *three* olives. (very good ones, but still...)Time to pay. One of your friends mistakes a fiver for a tenner. The manager comes and almost yells at him - \"there are five pounds missing, figure it out\". Your friend laughs nervously. You and your friends go home a bit hungry, with \u00a320 less in your pockets, and you wonder if you should buy a cheap pizza in a truly Italian place on the way home.At least it's not that noisy in the streets, so you can chat with your friends for the first time tonight.",

The food is simple, with most dishes employing five ingredients or less, and is executed very well on the whole, with some real standouts. It's also not overly expensive if you can reign yourself in from the tempting offerings. I really wanted to like Polpo, and after two long lunches there, am pleased to say that it is a place I really enjoy being at, and intend to frequent in the future. Getting ready for cicchetti Having just written about another Soho restaurant that offers good value for money, I am happy to be scribbling about another one which I recently discovered. Somewhat to my surprise, I was not the last London food blogger to visit the rather new and ever-popular Polpo. Indeed, it appeared that a twitter 'friend' I had communicated with virtually for some time had also not been (I know, the travesty), and it seemed like an apt time and place for a lunch with @KaveyF, the woman behind Kavey Eats. I had a lot of preconceived notions and high expectations about this place. Firstly, the response from bloggers that I generally tend to agree with had been decidedly mixed. Secondly, having been to Venice a number of times and understanding the bacari that Polpo presumably purports itself to be modelled after, I was cynical about how well they would be able to carry out this concept in central London, without the ethereal magic of the Venetian canals and architecture. (As a side note, it is quite a neat coincidence that Polpo does happen to sit right beneath the plaque marking the spot where Canaletto, the Venetian painter, lived in London). There are very few places in London that offer proper cicchetti (pronounced 'chi-ket-ee'), and I went to one just after starting this blog, which was a posher incarnation of the concept but wasn't half bad (just a bit pricey). At their heart, cicchetti are very small plates of simple food that Venetians typically have from anytime in the very late morning through to mid-to-late afternoon at local bars (bacari), and they are normally accompanied by a small glass of wine. From my own experience, they are typically eaten at the bar standing up, or possibly on a stool or outside the bacaro if it is a warm day, maybe overlooking the canal. In fact, the icon that I use for my online avatar is the shop-front of a very nice little bacaro that I happened upon while staying in the relatively quiet and peaceful Accademia neighborhood on my last visit to Venice. It's mostly frequented by locals and is quite traditional. They sell wine on a retail basis, offer some by the glass and a range of snacks to eat with the small glasses of wine they serve. I love the whole concept and ethos of snacking in Venice, so was hoping that Polpo wouldn't screw around with the simple and successful formula too much. Polpo's proprietor, Russell Norman, was formerly Operations Director at Caprice Holdings (Richard Caring's dining empire, which continues to expand rapidlyand internationally as of late) and, as such, has a lot of experiencing opening new restaurants and making them successful. He says that his two main inspirations for the restaurant were the bacari of Venice and Manhattan's Lower East Side, Tribeca and Soho, where he saw a particular type of place to eat and socialize that didn't exist in London. The place certainly opened with a bang, and much was made of Russell's proactive use of twitter right through the time leading up to the opening, and then during the eventual launch of the restaurant. Despite the reservations of some bloggers and critics, I was still excited to see what the place would be like, especially after having looked through the window many times on visits to other nearby haunts \u00a0one of my current favorite hang-outs in London is Bob Bob Ricard, which is literally just across the narrow Beak street. Made for Manhattan? I arrived at Polpo just about on time, as is my wont. Kavey had already arrived, though, and it turned out she had come prepared. Now I don't just mean that she had read a few blog posts, reviews and looked at the online menu and therefore had a good idea of what she might want to order. No, the girl had a very large Excel spreadsheet in a very small font size which cross-referenced the dishes on the website ample menu against what some of her trusted bloggers thought of each dish. I was impressed, but also slightly scared and we had a good chuckle over itbut it did prove very useful. The menus were the place-mats, so we didn't have to undergo the often annoying wait for menus to be given and explained to us. And I have to say, it all sounded very appetizing. We asked our lovely waitress how many dishes she recommended ordering and I was slightly surprised at the number of dishes she",

    "text": "We loved Polpo! It was a special celebration lunch for our little family and obviously I ahd not booked in advance... Lunch gets busy there so do come early or get lucky which is what happened to us. In any event if you are just 2 the wait shouldnt be too long and you can waith drinking a campari or other Italian aperitivo (4GPB). We sat at the bar with our 2 young kids on our knees and had a blast. The staff was really nice, casual but pro, and took good care of us, not many Italians though. There is a good vibe in this lively restaurant, so do not go if you want a quiet, formal lunch or dinner, but do go if you want the buzz of the city mixed with a relaxed, relaxed Italian-style place. Polpo is supposed to look and feel like a Venetian trattoria, they mostly manage this but the best part is the food. Tapas-style cicchetti plates are really great as you can try so many different tastes while keeping your bill to a reasonable level and leave feeling full enough. We loved everything, the crochette, the pumpkin risotto, the wet polenta, the steak with mushroom and ruccola (the best!), the fritto misto, the gelatto and finallly the simply perfect expresso. We had a san giovese wine with this and a 65 pounds bill. We are looking forward to try at night, wish there were more good and simple places like this in London!",

    "text": "Undoubtedly, the atmosphere, warmth and buzz are the best thing about this newcomer. It is great to see the addition of cicchetti to the ever growing roster of \"tapas\" of the world - don't get me wrong - I just wish they were tastier. The food was good, but not great, and at \u00a320 a head for a sufficient number of plates, dessert and a couple of beers, it's not a bad night out. The arancini, made with rice, peas and mozzarella were nice. Their croquette cousins were a bit bland, but the batter for both was excellent. The mackerel on polenta - tasteless and greasy. The fritto misto - avoid. It was surprisingly devoid of flavour, limp and must have been fried well before it was served. The cuttlefish with ink gremolata was unusual and quite tasty as was the pizzetta bianca. The pork belly with hazel nuts and radicchio was well presented and adequately tasty. Unlike the savouries, the desserts were all very good. The dense and creamy hot chocolate was perfect for the cold evening. The nut and honey semifreddo (ice cream cone served in a glass) was delicious, as was the flourless orange and almond cake. Overall, I enjoyed the evening and I would return because the atmosphere was good.",

The food was nice although I found the menu to limited in choice and variety; I only eat fish or the vegetarian options on a menu. Disappointed by the dessert menu, I did expect something better. The wine was pretty average and nothing special. Overall we each paid \u00a345 per head including food and wine I would say it wasn't worth the money spent. And would I go again?

A scruffy dining room that somehow, desipite distressed walls...that is truly distressed not designer distressed manages to be welcoming, buzzy, fun and 'foodie serious' all at the same time. We were seated by the owner, the lovely tousled haired Russell (also owns Boca di lupo) and immediately felt we were part of a 'secret' club, every single diner had a smug...'look at me arnt I lucky look on their face', given the q for tables, that wasn't surprising. The presmise of the food is Venetian Tapas, or cichetti as they're known in Italy and if that sounds faddy....well it's not...tiny potato croquettes, crisy on the outside melting in the middle arrived alongside a selection of other dishes priced between \u00a33-\u00a36 that were really really good and tasted somehow of Italy.crostini with wild mushrooms, calamari fritti, grilled vegetables, tiny pork ribs then the best thing i've tasted in a long long time arrived.......the meatballs....ohmygod....I am a bit of meatball fiend...love making them and love eating them and in fact considered mine to be the best ever after years of perfecting them...well.....they're not, these are...I urge to go just to taste these little balls of gorgeousness...incredible...moist, well seasoned, soft yet firm in a rich tomato sauce... I could have eaten bowl fulls of them. The bill for 5 dishes, a bottle of water and a glass of house white came \u00a327 for two of us. GO NOW.",

Tried about 12 dishes onlt one disappointment trapezzini or somehting like that which turned out to be 2 triangle of ham sandwich on white bread. Although I cannot remember everything eaten standouts were the sprats, proscuitto and fig dish, the duck, the steak and the black ink dish(I have hazy recollections of a fish of some sort being involved). Have no idea what it cost as the fourth estate paid(it pays to be a source) but whatever it was it was worth it for a very pleasnat evening.

    "text": "Polpo - Pics @ The London Foodie(thelondonfoodie.co.uk ) I thought there would be nothing else to add to the media frenzy surrounding Polpo, the new Italian darling and makers of cicheti or small-eats, or tapas or whatever-you-wanna-call-it in Soho. It's been blogged and highly praised by just about every food blogger in London \u00a0but after my disappointing meal there last Saturday, I thought I would put pen to paper and dare to differ. First impressions were excellent \u00a0the d\u00e9cor was charming, the front-of-house staff very friendly and the place nearly full and buzzing with a beautiful and trendy crowd at 5:45pm. We started the evening by ordering a couple of their breads, White Bean Bruschetta \u00a34 and Wild Mushroom Piadina \u00a34.80, followed by a selection of cicheti and crostini. The white beans had been cooked in rosemary and were very aromatic and perfectly al dente, a good Italian version of beans on toast. The Piadina was similar to a crepe and was filled with fried wild mushrooms. Both breads were nicely prepared although the portions were ludicrously small. We ordered two portions of each, and struggled to share them among the five of us. Our selection of cicheti and crostini included arancini \u00a31.50, anchovy & chick pea crostini \u00a31.10, potato and parmesan croquette \u00a31.20 and salt cod on grilled polenta \u00a32.10. I love Italian baccala (salted cod), and cook it frequently at home \u00a0I have made a similar dish of flaked salted cod with parsley, garlic and olive oil over grilled polenta a few times at home. These intensely flavoured ingredients should balance beautifully with the blander polenta, and when well made this dish is truly heavenly. Polpo's version however was very disappointing \u00a0the polenta was cold and soggy, and the salted cod completely tasteless. We ordered three pieces and we all agreed they were rather poor. The arancini were tiny and very uninspiring, and so were the anchovy & chick pea crostini and potato and parmesan croquettes. I tried a bit of each, and struggle to find anything at all to say about them. Completely passable comes to mind. The more substantial meat and fish dishes that we ordered included Slow Roasted Duck \u00a36.10, Calves Liver, Onion and Sage \u00a35.90, Grilled Flank Steak with Mushroom \u00a36.90, and Fritto Misto \u00a36.60. We also ordered a portion of Pork Belly, Radicchio and Hazelnuts @ \u00a35.70 but it never turned up. Two of these dishes were good \u00a0the calves liver was well cooked, although not as delicately flavoured and soft as it should have been, while the fritto misto (deep fried whitebait and seafood) was crisp and utterly delicious. The flank steak was beautifully presented but in my opinion lacked seasoning, and the slow roasted duck was unexciting. It was served in a pool of tomato sauce and did not look terribly appetizing. All portions were very ungenerous. To accompany the above we also ordered a portion of Roast Potatoes and Rosemary \u00a33.70, Grilled Polenta \u00a33 and Fennel, Curly Endive and Almonds @ \u00a33.90. These were all well made and flavoursome, but again the portions were minute. For pudding, we had a few Affogato al caffe \u00a32.60 each (vanilla ice cream immersed in espresso coffee), Flourless Orange & Almond Cake \u00a34.40, and Honey & Walnut Semifreddo @ \u00a33.80. The affogato tasted just right - both the ice cream and the coffee were of high quality. The orange and almond cake was light and delicious, and I enjoyed it immensely. I did not try the semifreddo but John seemed impressed with his choice. The wine list was impressive and reasonably priced, with bottles of white and red starting at \u00a315 through to \u00a338. Polpo serves most of its whites and a few reds in 250ml and 500ml measures at no extra cost. A bottle of 750ml will cost \u00a315 while 500ml & 250ml measures will cost \u00a310 and \u00a35 respectively. This is a nice thought, and the flat pricing structure should encourage wine drinkers to try different wine combinations to accompany their cicheti. My dinner companions were old friends from a wine club I used to belong to in Dulwich (Dulwich Wine Society), and therefore our wine choices were good but rather pricey. We had a couple of bottles of Gavi (white) \u00a330 each and two of Barbera (red) \u00a321 each. The total bill came to \u00a3208, including service, or \u00a342 per person. The general consensus was that it was a disappointing and expensive meal and some of us were still peckish at the end of it. Verdict \u00a0A clear example of style over substance. Good deep fried fish, good desserts, excellent wine list but tiny, ridiculously tiny portions. Some of the dishes were seriously disappointing for a restaurant currently the subject of such hype. I am not planning a return visit.",

Pretty decent sizes for what they cost too. The vibe overall is relaxed and very much in keeping with the Soho setting- bustling, lively and casual.

    "text": "Irritating no-reservations policy, made up for in spades with a buzzing atmosphere, great rustic lighting and lovely brown hues, and adorable little dishes such as mackerel tartare with horseradish, or calf's liver with onions and sage. Although many of the menu items are thoughtful and tasty, too few are genuinely adventurous, and there's a tendency towards weak flavours and slightly limp, insipid dishes. But the formula works well and is to be celebrated. The Italian wine list is enjoyable, though limited, and could be substantially improved. The wines are also available in carafes. Polpo almost immediately became a Soho institution and with good reason - it does informal, fun dining with real style.",

    "text": "Don't believe the hype! I went there with a friend from Toronto last Thursday PM and we had a nice drink downstairs in the quirky little bar. We were seated shortly afterwards, the place had a great atmosphere and the staf fairly attentive. Then came the sorry excuse for Italian style tapas food. In short the food was either luke warm, over or under cooked, basic slapped together left overs. Having ordered 8 dishes you would have thought atleast one was worh trying to finish, but sadly not. Trying to add some fun back into the evening I ordered the fail safe doughnuts come profiteroles. Literally one bite of this stale excuse for anything dessert like and that was game over. Go to Polpo to hang out and drink, but not to eat.",

    "text": "I've been to Polpo six times since it opened. I've always had great food and service here. I usually sit at the bar. All good, simple food. \u00a0Very similar to neighbourhood Italians in NYC. Really good meal with wine for \u00a335. I love it.. ..and I'm really glad to hear a few whiny people will be freeing up space for me to get a table a bit easier. I'm not sure this restaurant needs picky, over expecting 'foodie' bankers that demand massive plates of food, Michelin chefs and feel the need to publish their pompous stream of waffling consciousness as a judgment on each dish. Fab that you'll be staying away from my lovely neighbourhhood Italian restaurant.",

    "text": "With all the fanfare I honestly thought it would be better. The atmosphere is nice and the menu looks excellent, but the dishes themselves were a bit uninspired. The sardines came out cold. Fair enough it was on purpose, but can't say we really dug it. The fennel salad was boring, as were the beets and the chili prawns. The bruschetta with aubergine was the best thing we tried. It was all OK, but for the price and buzz, I expected more.",

    "text": "Is it just me or has the West End been invaded by tapas restaurants lately? Dehesa, Opera Tavern, Polpo, Polpette... the list goes on. I use the term \"tapas\" loosley here to mean Mediterranean sharing plates.... and all of these restaurants are thankfully are a far cry from the dishes of oily chorizo and patatas bravas served up with jugs of sangria that passed for \"tapas\" 10 years ago. Having heard horror stories of people being unable to get a table by 6.45pm, I turned up at Polpo 6 on the dot and gave them my name for a table of 3. I spent a pleasant hour at the bar quaffing the very nice and reasonably priced house merlot. The staff at the bar knew my name and the service is really friendly and attentive. The place is gorgeous looking with bare tile walls and bulbs hanging over the bar. Wine is served in carafes which adds lots of charm. By the time the last in our party arrived at 7pm the place was heaving, so I was worried that we might be waiting a long time for a table. However, the staff told me that now our whole party was there I was at the top of the list and we got a table 10 minutes later. I won't go on and on about the dishes as lots of others on here have done that in more detail than I can muster the enthusiasm for, but suffice to say that everything was quite nice.... but really didn't blow me away. I would say that the desserts were the highlight: we shared the rum and raisin doughnuts and the panettone bread and butter pudding - both were fabulous. But none of my party were left thinking 'wow' about the meal overall. We spent only around \u00a3110 between 3, which I think was excellent value. For me Polpo is one of Soho's finest in terms of atmosphere, but didn't quite nail it with the food.",

A half litre of white - why does that sound like so much more than 500ml? - a few crostini, a tasty pork belly that was enlivened by the generous sprinkle of toasted hazelnuts and a catch up on gossip with a friend made for a very enjoyable Monday night. When I realised they do Venetian Spritz we had to have one for the road. Total bill of \u00a338 seems like good value in this part of town.",
