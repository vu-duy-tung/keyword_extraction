What they served was very greasy, almost cold, and a pitiful portion. Absolutely tiny. There are many better and much cheaper cafes nearby where one can get a proper Full English Breakfast. S&M across the road on Brushfield Street is much better and there are other cafes on Middlesex Street and Wentworth Street that offer better food with much cheaper prices. My friend had the macaroni cheese and chiops and was disappointed with both the quantity and tase. He won't go back there again either. We were also served by numerous different people so it wasn't clear who we should tip. One person seated us, another took our order, another brought our food and another brought our bill. A strange place where you will leave hungry after their very greasy Full English and the macaroni cheese will leave a bad taste in your mouth.",

However, if you don't mind spending the money and want a more upmarket experience, Canteen is ideal. The one thing I do rate is their fresh fruit juices, I had a pink lady apple fruit juice which was absolutely delicious.

Lovely roast potatoes, nice yorkshire pudding, not enough meat but what I had was nice, and decent vegetables. You won't be disappointed by the roast dinner, it's just not amazing. Would I go again? Maybe, but there are so many great places to eat in Spittlefields so I'd be keen to explore them first next time.",

Some of the food is excellent (I really enjoy the devilled kidneys), some rather more ordinary. There are odd decisions: I once had a roast here, served in a bowl which didn't really work. Prices are on the high side, with some dishes definitely overpriced. Again, the service has varied from really helpful to pretty neglectful. It's usually fine, but sometimes lacks warmth. The surroundings match the name - canteen-like - a look which thankfully seems to be going out of fashion as it makes only limited concessions to customer comfort. All in all, this is a place where you can get an excellent meal and will usually get a decent one. However, it's just not somewhere I've ever been able to take to my heart.",

I was personally surprised by the less than enjoyable standard of food as the surroundings are quite impressive, clean & stylish and the waiters were good at keeping us informed \u00a0to which we smiled sweetly while slowly wasting away. We were lucky to be given a booth by the window, with nice comfy cushions to ease our wait, however I didn't envy the diners in the middle section of the room who sat on chairs with no backs and looked quite uncomfortable, I also don't relish sharing a dining table with strangers which the middle section would have been open to.Canteen do have an information booklet which I perused at leisure - the information contained within deserved 5 Stars as I learnt they only purchase their meats from farms where the animals have lived a happier life outdoors. Eggs are free range - the word Organic came up a lot, this is important to me and I hope these claims are true. Visually Canteen makes you feel you're on to a winner, the busy staff are reassuring therfore it comes as a disappointment when the eventual service & food standard falls below expectations. I wouldn't return or recommend to friends following my one & only experience which wasn't value for money.",

    "text": "Spitafields market is a fantastic spot for both shopping and eating and if you pre book a table at Canteen you can experience one of London's most famous British eateries whilst watching the hustle and bustle of market life from the best seat in the house through their floor-to-ceiling windows. Canteen is like a big glass cube on the corner that you can't miss. It has a very minimalist interior, with large wood block tables, soft spot lighting and plain white crockery. Here they let their take on modern British food with a twist do the talking. It's similar to a very well mannered old British Granny who has a penchant for blue rinses and wearing purple shoes. In other words, the food here is very British, but it likes to push the boundaries ever so slightly. They serve five different types of roast dinner and I've tried the roast beef that was really something to rave about. As they emphasize on using fresh, local produce you really can taste the earthy charm of British veg that has a much more rustic and subtle flavoursome quality about it after struggling to grow after months of bad weather. The last time I went I had baked beans amongst other things and I have no idea what they do to them, but they were absolutely scrumptious. Whoever knew that beans could taste so great. They also have a great wine list that really compliments the menu, with the house wine being a good value purchase for taste/cost.Compared to the homebody soul-food loving crowd that frequent another of my favourites, Leon that's also in the market, Canteen draws in a much sassier crowd of city workers and cool kids on the block, so expect a much more upmarket affair.",

Everything is clean, crisp, and feels classy without being intimating or alienating. The food is fairly traditional English cuisine - steak, bangers and mash, lamb, that sort of thing - but is immaculately presented and tastes amazing. The service was great, everyone was friendly and smiling, and the lighting in there was perfect for evening dining - as in, you're not being blinded, but you can still see the person that you came in with. Absolutely no complaints. I would definitely recommend this to someone who was looking to take a date out in this area.",

The tables (some are benches for 6), backless chairs, and semi-open kitchen are meant to emulate - in a very modern way - the school cafeteria look and feel, I guess. I don't care much about that sort of thing, but it's not overbearing at Canteen so it doesn't matter one way or the other too much. The vibe is very relaxed, especially if you're sitting outside (still covered by the Spitalfields roof, though) as we did. The menu, I like. It's large and covers all the bases. You can get breakfast all day long, whether you're looking for Greek yoghurt with honey and almonds, or eggs benedict, a bacon sandwich, or just toast and marmite. Lots of choice of good-sounding starters, but I had the slow-roasted pork belly with apples (very good, and done with fennel). There's also sausage and mash, chicken and chips, macaroni cheese and more: the canteen theme remains, but it's all done to a high standard. The cost, while certainly higher than canteen food, isn't bad for this part of London: \u00a39-\u00a312 for mains, but my pork was substantial. There are some regular dishes they serve every day, although the details change. They always have a full roast dinner (either beef, lamb, pork, or duck), they always have two stews or bakes (one meat and one veg), they always have two pies (one meat, one veg), and they always have one or two fish specials. My wife had the pollock grilled with butter and herbs and said it was excellent. We didn't go for dessert although both the chocolate and beetroot cake, and the substantial cheese board, beckoned. Wine list was decent and everything on it appeared to be available by bottle, carafe, and glass (a nice change to the places that give you little choice if all you want is a single glass). Dinner last night - pork for me, fish for her, a side of salad for me, steamed seasonal greens for her, a glass of wine each, and a bottle of sparkling water came to just under \u00a344, with service charge included. We were full, and didn't need starter or dessert. Service was efficient and very friendly. The women at the table next to us, out-of-towners, asked the waiter if he knew how to get to Angel station. The waiter popped out his phone and happily looked up the route for them. There's another branch in the Royal Festival Hall.",

    "text": "I recently visited Canteen with some work colleagues as part of a retirement party. When first presented with the menu, back in my office, I was somewhat disdainful; I enjoy traditional British food, but the menu just screamed, well, 'school canteen' at me. Canteen prides itself on serving up traditional British food, made from freshly source ingredients. Typically, the menu boasts a variety of pies, roasts and other delights such as devilled kidneys and macoroni cheese. Upon entering Canteen, I was pleasantly surprised by the decor - light, airy and stylish, with an outside seating area for the braver-hearted soles amongst us. The waiting staff were smart and knowledgable about the food, happy to share their knowledge and answer any questions. Service was reasonably quick and friendly. I plumped for devilled kidneys to begin with, which shortly arrived. They were presented on a thick slice of white toast, seasoned with mustard which certainly tingled the tastebuds, quite a stark contrast to the crumbly sensation of the kidneys. I chose to follow this up with one of the Canteen pies - a pork and cider creation. The meat was tender, nicely complemented by the cider, though the pastry was slightly stodgy. However, my starter was heavy so the two dishes did not complement each other well - my fault for choosing heavy dishes. The mashed potato which accompanied the pie was perfect - rich and buttery, with no lumps. My colleagues were also satisfied with their choices of food - the smoke haddock being a very popular choice. Despite being full, I am a lady who cannot say no to a sweet course. After being unable to choose from the puddings on offer, my curiousity got the better of me and despite disliking beetroot, I opted for the homemade chocolate and beetroot cake having being assured by our friendly waitress that it was divine. It was certainly different and after the initial shock of chocolate and beetroot being served together, it was actually a rather pleasurable experience, with the bitterness of the chocolate cancelled out by the sweetness of the beetroot. The espresso coffee served afterwards seemed to be little more than a shot of rather weak Americano, almost as if they brewed a mug and then shared it out between the group. No side chocolate here, just a mint imperial, of the type you can buy from the local newsagents. Perhaps I ask too much, but when I pay for an otherwise excellent meal, I expect it to be excellent all the way to the end. Other than the slightly lucklustre ending, I would recommend Canteen as a relaxed dining experience at reasonable prices. You won't get exquisite, exotic delights, but you will get good, honest British food.",

It's quite unassuming from the outside and the name of the place isn't too great, but nevertheless the staff were really friendly and attentive and the food very good. We went for an early lunch, \u00a0so I ordered macaroni cheese with tomatoes and bacon-it was delicious. Sadly my phone decided not to play ball, so no photos of that;(My friends orders scones with jam.-The jam apparently is home made on site, which is quite rare these days. my other friend order fish fingers - which were real fish goujons, not the processed stuff you might expect.The only downside was the waitress trying to charge me \u00a350 instead of \u00a315-always check before putting in your PIN!",

If you add a drink to the mix then I'd say it is a little pricey but the the jugs of water that are brought to the table as standard is a nice touch.",

We ordered drinks and some cheese straws to tide us over. The beer choice is pretty good, Bitter & Twisted for me, which worked well with the very cheesy, flaky cheese straws which were nice but a little bit on the dry side.And then it was time for pie!The pies are individually baked and of a good size, not too much that you end up feeling stuffed and, unlike other places, they were actually pies, not the 'stuff in a bowl with pastry on top' abominations other places dare to call a pie!!I was a little disappointed by the portion of mash, but that's probably just because my love of the potato is so high. The mash was good, thick, not too creamy and well seasoned. The accompanying cabbage and gravy were ok too, a nice crunch to the cabbage and the gravy was well flavoured.The pie itself was tasty, but for the much touted 'award winning' mention I had expected better. It wasn't bad, the crust was flaky, the filling tasty but it was just a pretty good pie, not sure it was worthy of an award. The main reason we were there was to meet up with some friends so, from that point of view it was an excellent lunch! (I'm lucky that I am friends with some very lovely people). Service wise we were well attended, and overall it was a good meal.3 stars feels a little harsh but to give 4 I'd need to have been more impressed than I was. It's a nice space, with competent friendly staff and good food, but it's nothing particularly special.",

When we first looked in the door it was empty. It looked like a small cafe and at first we thought we had the wrong place. So we walked around the block. When we returned having found no alternative we walked in. We then saw one staff member who led us to the interior which was a bit like the Tardis. It's not immediately obvious from the front door but the restaurant is quite extensive and expands out as you walk toward the rear of the smaller first bit of the building. The staff were friendly and the food was great. Having power points under the table was a nice touch. The wifi was also good. It's surprising how many places get the wifi wrong. I think their wifi password was bangersandmash from memory. I appreciated the comedy value. The scones were divine as were the sandwiches. They were so good in fact we asked for the recipe and they obliged. They only lost a star because when we asked for another pot of tea the waiter forgot and after 15 minutes of waiting we had to prompt another member of staff. I liked the vibe in Canteen. It was unhurried and had a retro cafe feel to it without the negative aspects of a greasy spoon. Not dissimilar to the Ace Cafe.",

Although the food was nice, I wouldn't say it was award winning. My macaroni cheese was tasty enough and my boyfriend enjoyed his chicken and chips but I'm not sure either meal merited their price tag. I'm not a big fan of the minimalist look they've gone for with the decor either. When you're served a mountain of mac and cheese you really need to recline in a proper chair afterwards and work up the energy to walk it off. Long tables and bright lights make it feel like the worst sort of canteen, one you might find in a hospital ward or a run down school. Our service was a bit patchy and although the waiter was very pleasant, he got our drinks order wrong twice and then brought us the wrong bill!I realise that this review sounds a bit negative but it's based on the principal that whilst this is a good place to eat, it's not the best. If you've read as much about this place as I had then you might have heightened expectations- lower these a little and you'll really enjoy it here.",

A relatively upscale establishment specialising in high quality British food, and just about the best place for Sunday brunch. Period.Located smack bang in the middle of Spitalfields Market in London's East End, Canteen on a Sunday morning is a maelstrom of media types, yummy mummies and the historic area's requisite tourists. Aesthetically it is the love child of an industrial looking bachelor pad and a particularly quaint Scandinavian country abode.With its emphasis on clean, seasonal, locally sourced food and additive free meat, Canteen should easily satisfy most aware foodies' ethical imperatives while serving the kind of hearty, fail-safe food you wish your mum could master.Case in point: Canteen's breakfast and all day menu which ranges from low G.I. austere - toast and marmite, porridge - to classically decadent - bacon, fried eggs and bubble and squeak - to by-gosh-this-is-the-best-I've-ever-had Eggs Benedict.At \u00a33.00 for an orange juice prices can be steep but quite frankly who cares when the food, and your post-meal conscience, is as clean as this.",

I would have liked a bit more choice on the menu and some slightly lower prices but my unusual squash, fennel and barley dish was both healthy and delicious and the wine I drank was a particularly good red. The staff are helpful and are tolerant to special requests when it comes to modifications you might request to the available dishes. Probably gets very busy on certain days.",
