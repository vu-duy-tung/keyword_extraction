    "text": "Most meat eaters agree that you can't beat a good steak. That's probaby why Angus Steak House can be found in flashy Central London locations. However, it's important not to be fooled by big names. My meal at Angus Steak House in Leicester Square was one of the least enjoyable and most overpriced I've ever had. These places are strictly for clueless tourists and are very squarely aimed at undiscerning Americans. The decor is gaudy and twenty years out of date. The service is false and unconvincing and geared towards selling instead of giving you what you want. All of this would be forgiveable if you were treated to a first class steak but that's not the case. Underseasoned, over tenderised meat without taste or texture is accompanied by microwaved tinned muchrooms and lukewarm french fries. It should be easy for chefs to get steak and chips right but something has gone horribly wrong here. The Angus Steak House is a prime example of what happens when people stop caring about delivering quality food for locals and instead rely on conning unfortunate tourists.",

Not only was it one of the few places open, having not made a reservation anywhere, we were desperate. Seeing that they were actually full of people, we decided \"hey, it has to be somewhat decent\". We chose the best looking one on the corner in Leicester Square, and were immediately sat with a table of 5, even though it looked packed. The menu didn't have much selection, and not being in the mood for a big steak or slab of ribs, I went with an appetizer and a couple of sides, including mac and cheese & a mixed greens salad. The walls are lined with bottles of wine, so a cheap 22pound bottle of wine was ordered, as well.Other than one friends steak being a little undercooked (and she ordered medium rare....haha), I was satisfied with the service, promptness, and food overall. After trying my friends ribs, I had wished I would of went all out and ordered them . They tasted so good (and he just had the regular 'ol bbq slab). Definitely suggest for a \"maybe\" dinner if in the area for theatre and not in the mood for Chinese. ORDER THE RIBS!",

I've been to this location twice, once in 2007 New Years Eve, and once in 2009 with my wife.We ordered two steaks, thinking they might come with chips, and what we received were two bland, over cooked tiny chunks of meat that looked like they had been dropped on the floor.In an attempt to get some flavor for the steak we asked the waitress for some sauce and found that she couldn't speak a word of English. Then we asked another and the same thing happened. It's a pretty expensive place, in a good enough area, but for some reason they opted for the most rude and curt staff possible.If you're trying to impress a date, this is NOT the place.",

    "text": "When my sister suggested the Angus Steak House I rolled my eyes at the prospect of overpriced steak, chips and peas. Nonetheless when she convinced me to venture inside where we were quickly greeted by a charming smiling waiter, I had a good feeling about this place... The menu took me by surprise, rather than being riddled with steak and more steak, there were different meat options, decent fish and vegetarian dishes and mixed platters. Despite being in a 'steak house' me and my sister were so impressed with the non steak dishes that I opted for a lamb shank and she a mixed platter. \u00a0Well, what can I say, my lamb shank was divine. The best part was not the meat (which was still amazing) but the silky smooth mash and rich red wine gravy. My sister's platter included ribs, chicken wings, onion rings and potato skins filled with cheese. Not the best platter I have seen in my twenty years, but it definitely filled a whole and my sister was smiling throughout. It is a shame that I cannot comment on the steak. I did eye up other diners steak however, which looked nothing less than the big and juicy slabs of meat you would expect from a place that is brave enough to put the word 'steak' in its name. The place had a classy modern feel to it with its black and red colour scheme, and the service we received was extremely good - the staff were smart, friendly and almost overly polite. The menu was much more varied than I had expected, and the above average food met the slightly above average prices. I would definitely recommend this restaurant -carnivore or not- if you are looking for top service, decent quality and quantity food and you don't mind slashing out that little extra.Oh, and if you accidently leave a shopping bag there, they will have it ready and waiting for you on your return, (not that I did something so stupid...)Enjoy.",

Minding out P's and Q's in front of Prince Charles and Prince Andrew we sipped champagne and nibbled on the Posh Canap\u00e9s. Desperate to let our hair down we were itching to catch the tube to the West End, starving and in need of a pint we headed straight for Leicester Square still in Uniform. What could be better after 3 months at sea than a huge Steak. We sat outside (drawing plenty of attention in our uniforms) and were served a huge feast of steak and ribs. With the pints flowing we ate our way through our weight in meat it just kept coming. The waitress we had was unreal, she was so attentive, our pints never dried up and our plates were always full. We all had a steak, some had sirloin some had a rib eye and I had a Fillet Steak (all 12oz) and it was cooked perfectly pink in the middle with mushroom sauce, steak chips and onion rings plus a plate of ribs on the side (we are hungry lads). We had cold meats and combo platters to share as well as mixed breads. We nearly rolled out of the restaurant after being there for over three hours.We felt like kings the manager even came out for a chat and recommended some bars we should go to that night. I have honestly never eaten so well or been to a better restaurant. I would say to anyone visiting London and wanting a top quality steak to go to this Restaurant in Leister Square. We have been told were back in London in November and we are all looking forward to our Trip to Angus Steak House \u00a0we have even planned what sauce we are having on our Ribs. Bring it on!

Ordered a lemonade but it came out as a Sprite with a lemon wedge-when asked about that, they did take it back. There was also a \"cover charge\" we didn't know about-even though it's just 1 pound each, it would be nice to know ahead of time. For 2, it came to be 55 pounds along with a tip. We regret not checking with Yelp before settling for this place.",

    "text": "The Angus Steak House is in a premium tourist location, Leicester Square. They employ a lot of nice ladies, including the one in front of the outside dining area who's being paid to lure you in. You wouldn't really expect this to be a place for budget dining, and you'd be right: The steaks are of great quality, if not only cooked to order (my 300g sirloin steak, ordered rare, came almost well-done - I sent it back. The second time they got it right). But they sure aren't cheap, since they come without chips or salad or sauce! I ordered the sweet potato chips on the side, and those were fine. However, my starter, garlic mushrooms, was a big disappointment: The mushrooms clearly came from the can, and there was no garlicky taste at all. They were also cold when they finally reached my table. Hint: Don't eat here if you're in a hurry. They had Stella from tap, a fiver for a pint. There is a budget menu option at lunchtime, but when I arrived I was told everything but chicken was already out. I told the waitress I wasn't visiting a steak house to eat chicken anyway, upon which she smiled. That should have been my first warning. Service is friendly, if not particularly efficient. I counted four waiters and waitresses that serviced me during the meal. Not counting the \"lady bait\" at the entrance. Again, it's a premium tourist spot. I wouldn't call it a rip - off, \u00a0but \u00a340 for a starter, the steak, the fries, and two pints is something I'm not going to seek out again any time soon.",

We ended up staying...again only for my family member's honor, but I would not recommend this place. The staff is incredibly rude.In terms of the food, my sirloin steak was half fat and absolutely tasteless.",

At the start I ordered 1 beer, 1 coke and 2 tap waters, however the waitress returned with 2 cokes. The beer was rectified but the waters where never received. I asked for another coke at one point and it never same also, we got the generally idea we had been forgot about with the drink errors and the lateness of the main courses.

Do NOT be fooled.The foundation of any reputable steakhouse is the quality of its meat and the manner in which it has been cooked. Here, Angus failed in both respects. My meat was not cooked as per my instruction. Even upon being returned to the kitchen. The meat, which came at a staggering \u00a319, was served alone. Yes. Entirely naked. Devoid of any sides or even a sauce. You were required to pile everything else on top for an additional fee. That would have been acceptable had the meat been up to standard. Next, the waiting staff. Aside from taking 15 minutes to actually take my order, they could do with a class in manners and etiquette. Especially for a seemingly \"higher\" end establishment. I had to ask for my waitress to be changed. The only bright spark was the hostess/lady at the door. She was wonderfully polite. If you find yourself gazing longingly at the door (seeking to unravel Angus's subtle enigma) walk away very quickly. My advice: head towards the Flatiron Steak establishment 10 minutes away; you will never spend a better \u00a315 on steak!",

The only good things about this place are the dessert and the building.It was way overpriced.The meat was average for the price, and the coleslaw tasted more like glue than actual coleslaw (still charges you 3.50\u00a3 for it somehow)The biggest problem is the staff. The waiters are really bad at their job. Not only are they bad at serving you, but they are also really bad at talking behind customers back and making fun of them. Most of the time, they would just stand next to the bar and talk to each other and giggle like little teenage girls and whining about how that guy eats or how this other guy looks like a fat frog when he eats. Best part is that they don't whisper when they say stuff like that and you can hear everything. And they expect you to tip them hahaha.One advice \u00a0: if you want meat, you're better off with a double whopper from burger king.AVOID THIS PLACE",
