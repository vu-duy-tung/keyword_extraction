    "text": "Fantastic upscale restaurant that I have been to several times since 2008. Like everyone else, I also tend to think that The Mango Tree is on the pricey side (maybe not even that surprising, given its rather exclusive location). My experiences there have been very good. To be fair, I used the omnipresent vouchers cutting my food bill by 50% - hence, I may be somewhat biased. Nonetheless, the service was very friendly (I was very impressed with the staff offering to put on my coat for me), courteous and (relatively) efficient. I have also been quite pleased with the food, particularly given how selective and, frankly, critical I tend to be at times. This is a truly lovely Thai restaurant - however, I deduct one star for its rather inflexible table turnover policy, which results in you not being able to stay beyond 1/1/2 or 2 hours. But yeah, other than that wonderful food in a commensurate atmosphere.",

Having booked online, so as to receive half price food, we found that despite its location and swish appearance, the prices were really quite reasonable. Portions were decent sized to the point where it was impossible to finish our meal, but would probably seem less substantial if you were not eating quite so early. Go for this place if you are grabbing a quick meal between arriving at Victoria and going to a nearby theatre.",

    "text": "I want to like The Mango Tree - I really really do. After all, numerous people flock here, so THEY obviously like the food. But this must be my worst restaurant review thus far (and trust me, no matter how bad the food is, I usually try to give sympathy points). However, having given this restaurant 2 chances to convert my Nays to Ayes, I'm finally ready to throw in the towel. My latest visit (28/06/09) was a near disaster. We ordered 2 starters - Chicken Satay and Thai Fish Cakes. I KNOW my satays - having grown up a steady diet of these grilled kebabs. They almost always grace the table each time I visit a Singapore/Malaysian/Thai restaurant. When I took the first bite of satay from Mango Tree, my first thought was.. hmm, this tastes a bit 'off/odd' - something wasn't quite right. And my goodness, it arrived lukewarm, an almost unpardonable sin for this BBQ/Grilled meat item. But then I dismissed it as.. every restaurant does it differently, and besides.. my dinner companion and myself were famished. We tucked in with gusto annihilating 2 sticks of satay within minutes. We decided to split the 3rd stick - that was when I paid more attention to cutting up the meat. To my horror, I realised the meat was completely pink inside - totally RAW!! No wonder it 'tasted funny'!! Now, I like my Sashimi, but I don't rate chicken meat very high on the raw scale. I showed my discovery to a horrified waiter who promptly whisked the offending plate away. He promised to 'replace' it with another satay dish - this time, properly grilled. We didn't have to wait too long - the dish arrived within 10 minutes, this time piping hot, and properly cooked within. But the damage had been done - you cannot create a 1st impression a 2nd time. That said, I've actually had satay at Mango Tree the 1st time I was there. I don't quite recall the experience (forgettable), but it probably didn't taste too awful either. It was passable, but not great. The thai fish cakes, on the other hand, were rather tasty (and served hot!). Perhaps, it was a mite on the tough side (very chewy), but it was perfectly acceptable. For the main course, I had ordered the Green Curry Chicken Udon - which turned out surprisingly tasty. The curry is a little thicker than some Thai restaurants, thus creating a stew-like gravy backdrop for the udon noodles, but it worked well. My only complaint is that there were only 4 small bite-size chunks of chicken in the rather miserly bowl of udon noodles (very small portion). The grilled vegetables within tasted a little raw, but I'm trying to dismiss that as part of the 'unique cooking style' for this dish. I can't possibly be THAT unlucky 2 times in a row!! If you're planning to try the Green Curry Chicken Udon noodles, do make sure you order a starter, or maybe even another main course - you're likely to feel hungry still, if you think you can get away with just the main course. Big portions aren't Mango Tree's strongest points (apparently, grilled meats aren't, either). Having given such a harsh review so far, I am hoping to tone down and give a more positive note to the other main course, the Stir-Fry Chicken with Cashew Nuts. However, I'd be lying if I called that dish tasty - Thai restaurants pride themselves for strong and tasty flavours. This chicken stir-fry was so bland (too little gravy as well) that I had to spice things up a bit by adding the green curry gravy to it, so as to add a little 'flavour', something I loathe to do, since it would affect the actual taste of the food. But there was just no taste to the chicken with cashew nuts! Finally something I can recommend from this restaurant. The desserts - we ordered their homemade ice cream (3 different scoops), which turned out fairly original. I especially liked mixing the ice cream with a bit of the sticky rice at the bottom of the bowl (yummy). The pandan flavoured scoop was probably the nicest.. and I can't quite decide if I like the chocolate with lemongrass still, I suppose the pink scoop (I can only guess it might be raspberry)is the most conventional of all, but probably the most boring. I liked the other 2 flavours better, since they're more exciting. The lychee cheesecake was nice, but a little soggy. Having made cheesecakes myself, I'm a little taken aback by the sogginess of this particular cheesecake, but I suppose, if you've survived all the previous courses, a little soggy cheesecake wouldn't horrify you too much. It's amazing - I went to Mango Tree with NO EXPECTATIONS this time round, because I'd been let down on my last trip. And yet, it's completely miraculous how they've managed to lower the bar to a level where no other restaurant has gone. If I seem unreasonably harsh, that is because.. this is an establishment which has made a name for itself for serving 'good food'. People actually go there to eat (it was packed on a Sunday evening!) and they have regulars! The restaurant has a",

The place immediately strikes the visitor with its grand interior, with modern furnishing, high ceilings and large windows with views onto the Grosvernor Place outside. The layout of the dining area is open and spacious and while it's bustling with customers, the tables are places at a good distance from one another. Most dishes are prepared well, with a modern luxury take on traditional Thai food. I particularly enjoy the hot and sour soup, spicy chicken salad wrap and the green curry dishes. By what I can judge, grilled and stir fry dishes, of which there is a plentiful choice, are pretty good as well. The service is also brilliant, with many professional staff happy to assist any minute, which certainly enhances the dinning experience. But quality of course comes at a price and Mango Tree is quiet expensive. The bill adds to about \u00a3100 per person for the full dinner including drinks. Given the high class atmosphere and great quality food, I think it's well justified by London standards though.",

Even though we changed our booking time a number of times we were pleased that when we arrived at the restaurant, despite the obvious number of people sitting around waiting for tables, that we were immediately seated. It was very clear that the waiters were under a lot of pressure to clear the tables as quickly as possible if the fact we were asked about 3 times in the first 10 minutes whether we were ready to order was any indication. Finally those around us got the hint and left us alone until we signalled the waiter for attention. The menu at Mango Tree is extensive (both drinks and food) and, aside from the fact we were busy chatting and catching up, just working out way through the menu took us quite some time (food came very quickly once we did order though.) Mango Tree was a very pleasant experience. Service, apart from the sort of rushed start, was fantastic and friendly. Food was top notch and cocktails, including a nice array of non-alcoholic ones, were very tasty. The only drawback was the price -the \u00a315.50 a curry without rice gives you an indication - quite highly-priced for Thai food. You can capitalise on deals though top table though which give you 50% which brings the price back to something a bit more value for money.",

I had always thought of little neighborhood Thai places with plastic tablecloths, sweaty cooks and fantastic cheap food. Mango Tree is different. It brings the romance of fine dining to the flavours of Thailand, right here in London. As soon as I walked in the door I could see that this was no neighborhood noodle place. The interior is immaculate, and the waiters numerous and impeccibly dressed. And the food. The food is incredible, the best curry I have eaten, and presented in a creative and colourful way. My only complaint? The prices. This place is not cheap, but here's the tip: Keep your eye out for special deals. Mango Tree seem to use special deals to keep the restaurant full, because without the common punters in there for a bargain slice of the high life, I think it would be pretty quiet mid week. Their website often advertises the deals on at the moment, and lastminute.com also has set meal deals most of the time. It's a winner, but only at the right price!",

The Mango Tree definitely thinks its in the second category. This is clear from the attentiveness of the staff when you arrive and the way they smoothly usher you off into the bar for a cocktail while you wait to be seated. My first issue arose on the way to our table \u00a0the dining room is big and very well lit, with probably too many tables squeezed in. Most tables were taken so it was crowded, bright, and very noisy. As a result the ambiance didn't work for me. I ordered soft shell crab to start and a spicy stir fired prawn dish for main course. Both were fine but tasted like western versions of Thai dishes, lacking the real flavour kick I normally experience with Thai food. As a result this was probably my most disappointing experience ever in a Thai restaurant. The prices were pretty steep too. We had a 40% toptable discount, but sneakily this doesn't apply to Chef's choice dishes which it turned out included half the menu!",

The service was attentive and efficient, water re-filled prompty etc- no complaints there. The place looks great and has definite atmosphere.

For mains we had a vegetable red curry and stir-fried veges with cashew nuts. The flavours in the curry were quite nice- fragrant and delicate but the sauce was too creamy-heavy and there was no spicy kick at all in it. The stir-fry was...a stir fry. It was nicely cooked- not overdone, but there was a soy-sauce based sauce on it which was just bland. Perhaps Mango Tree caters for the carnivores better as reviewers with meat dishes seem to have fared better...Overall, at \u00a368 for 2 meals and a cocktail each (we had no discount voucher etc) it was far too expensive for what we got- there is better Thai about for a much better price!",

Service was awesome and the entire experience was just top notch.A bit on the pricey side but I guess you pay for what you get. it was worth every pound. If i lived in London id have to dine here regularly :)",

Now, Mango Tree is really huge with numerous tables and when you find yourselves to be the only table there in such a vast space, it does lend an uncomfortable silence of you-can-hear-a-pin-drop vibe to the place. In fact, we only saw one other occupied table throughout our meal there. After our lunch, all I can say is that the whole meal was quite forgettable and I wasn't blown away by any of the dishes.",

I'm a big fan of Thai food and I think their seasonal specials are what makes this a better than average Thai restaurant. The Thai green curry is good not amazing, similar to the Pad Thai. The starters are pretty average, but then Thai fish cakes and spring rolls are either good or not good in my book. They have some great cocktails and I think the waiting staff have always been fabulous. There's a nice bar on entry if you arrive early and they have some killer cocktails. Well worth a visit and pretty reasonably priced, it's just not mind blowing.",

The orchids and dark wood combined with dim lighting provides a warm atmosphere. \u00a0However we were slightly disappointed that our table was not ready even though my friend had reserved a table a week before!We waited in the bar and enjoyed some red wine and were eventually seated at our large circular table along the back wall. We waited a while which was disappointing considering we had had to wait for our table. My yellow curry monk fish was very tasty with lots of flavour and I could not fault the food. However one of my friends was given the wrong order and was made to feel difficult when she asked for her dish.Mango Tree is definately one of the finest looking restaurant in London and I think the price reflects its location and interior. I have tasted better Thai food in smaller less luxorious restaurants but I would still return to Mango Tree for a special occassion. Hopefully someone else will be paying!",

    "text": "Wow, colour me impressed. And full. And broke. And ready to do it again tomorrow. The Mango Tree wasn't cheap, so let's get that out of the way early. You'll pay for deliciousness, but it's actually quite a fair deliciousness-to-cost ratio, so you won't leave grumpy. As Matt pointed out, the address is Grosvenor Place, Belgravia... so welcome to my world - where it literally costs me \u00a310 to sneeze. (Maybe I should look up the definition of 'literally'... but I'll save that for another time.)With that out of the way, I may now begin to review-drool all over the place with how amazing each dish was. Portions were healthy, flavours were fantastic and completely different dish by dish, spice was spot on, and menu creativity was high. (Red duck curry in a carved out pineapple? Yes please!) We had beef. We had chicken. We had swordfish, and prawns, and scallops, and duck, and tuna, and squid, and they were all complimented by the freshest of veggies and perfectly cooked egg fried rice and glass noodles. The multiple sauces were also divine with some of the tastiest peanut sauce I've had to date. Last but not least, the dessert was unspeakably good - homemade chocolate and lemongrass ice cream with two heaping brownies drizzled in warm chocolate sauce. Seriously, I can't even talk about it. It was perfection.The venue layout is quite grand and stylish, although I'm not sure how I felt about eating shot-gun style where I was closer to my neighbours than my dining partner. There were some fantastic round group tables which I definitely would prefer in the future.Overall, if you're looking for a place to eat some amazing food (and are willing to drop a bit of cash,) this should definitely be your go-to spot. Hell, just go for dessert and cocktails! It was truly a fabulous evening. Highly highly recommended.",

By our powers of ordering combined, we devoured scallops, shrimp, swordfish, \u00a0steak salad, duck and satay sauce, that was like heaven itself.

We went for wine at the bar first, although after sneaking peeks at everyone around us and their cool looking cocktails, I wish i had tried one.The menu was enormous, and it had a great vegetarian and vegan section but it took as long to pick out what we wanted to eat as it did for us to eat it. That being said, what we finally decided on was delicious, especially the Gae Yang (lamb in the grill section of the menu). Although it was a bit too pricey for my budget, I will definitely go back when my parents are in town.",

And I was really surprised that they actually charge you for rice per bowl... \u00a33 per serving ?!?!? seriously ?! \u00a0I never came across a Thai restaurant in US or in Asia that charge for the rice. Is this a UK thing or is this just the restaurant? The service was ok, our waitress was kinda robotic ... didn't show any interest of serving the customer... but again, it seems that is the case in UK in general. Overall good ambient but again overpriced ... averaging \u00a335 per head for a soup and an entree .... not really worth it.",

AGAIN PLEASE!!!!\" to your neighbour. \u00a0And believe me, if you're in a group, you're neighbour is the ONLY one you have a hope of conversing with. \u00a0Ugh. \u00a0No wonder conversation is a dying art... there's nowhere to practice it.On the upside, I was the glad the acoustics were bad as I'd always regretted the fact that my ex-bf and I had chosen the equally noisy E&O over Mango Tree for a romantic Thai birthday dinner. \u00a0Regret begone!I didn't dislike the food at Mango Tree - I didn't love it - but it was fine. \u00a0A touch pricey, perhaps - but if you book online and get the 50% off coupon, it could almost be considered cheap. \u00a0I had the vegetarian Pad-Thai, which was a little weird because there were no noodles and no peanuts - just strips of tofu and a few veggies (i know, i know, did they bring me the right dish?) - for you Americans out there, the taste was actually reminiscent of the veggie lettuce wraps at P.F. Chang's. \u00a0So.. not terrible, just not at all what I expected.Sadly, the terrible acoustics and the 'eh' food is really just too bad since if there's one thing Mango Tree did have, it would be the most attentive, politest, how-in-the-world-can-we-possibly-please-you service I think I've ever had in London. \u00a0We had several servers tending to us and they were all incredibly courteous... verging on endearing. \u00a0I may go back simply to feel like a princess again.",

I started with the Prawn and Pork Wonton soup (8.50) which arrived three small dumplings in a small bowl in a clear broth. \u00a0Although small, the soup was tasty nonetheless. We also ordered a few dim sum dishes since the dumplings were mostly served in threes. \u00a0We ordered the prawn dim sum (7.95), Inside soup dumpling dim sum (19.50), and spare rib dumpling (7.50). \u00a0Dumplings were yummy but with the pound kicking the dollars butt, our check total without tip amounted to 60something pounds or roughly $100something USD and I don't know about you but I can get a shitload of dim sum for the kind of money here in the states (holla Chinatown NYC or Arlington VA) and it probably tastes just as or even more delicious and authentic. \u00a0But at least we can say we ate lunch at Harrods! \u00a0Their food court and options sure beats any food court here in the states.",

Despite having a separate vegetarian menu, I would argue that the selection was still fairly limited and the food distinctly average. This combined with a rather hefty bill will probably rule out any hasty return.",

A glance away from my plate showed a table full of happy diners too. The dessert was divided by 4 and there was still plenty to go around especially as I felt like Mr Creosote from Monty Python's The Meaning of Life (the wafer thin after diner mint is still in my wallet).The restaurant is on the large side as opposed to intimate \u00a0with the toilets a bit of a trek down the stairs but it was packed at 9:15 on a Sunday night so they must be doing something right.",

    "text": "The Mango Tree is the only place I ever go for Thai. Everything, from the food to the decor, is simply gorgeous. In the evening it has a perfect atmosphere; dimly lit, confident yet inviting, with a hint of the exotic. I usually go with a group of friends and we always sit at one of the circular tables along the back wall where you can get a great view of the grand interior not to mention the food gliding past you on the arms of the well polished waiters as you chat. Our waiter once even told me the whole room has been feng-shui designed to ensure a perfect dining experience. The photo really doesn't do it justice as the chocolate coloured wood contrasting with bright orange orchids in itself looks good enough to eat.Having a great experience here is effortless, for a start, the food is delicious. There's a fabulous cocktail menu that we usually begin with, skipping the first course. For the main I usually go for Gaeng Garee Pla, a yellow monkfish and butterfish curry, or the Moo Nam Pueng, slow roasted pork belly with red cabbage and an orange chilli sauce. Although often we order a few dishes between us and try them all (trust me, when you see the food you will want a taste of everything on the entire menu). The desserts are divine too, my favourite being the Lavender Rose and Kalamansi sorbets, both delicate flavours to finish with. Whilst the staff are always happy to advise on the extensive wine list. I suggest you try the 1999 Barolo, a seriously good all rounder. The service is impeccable, although I do find the girl in the bathroom who's waiting subserviently, with eyes lowered, to dry your hands a bit OTT. Channel polish or not, I think everyone can just about manage to do that part themselves. I could go on forever complimenting The Mango Tree, it's just one of those places where such great food and attention to detail can't fail to provide you with the ingredients for a wonderful night. It's remained a firm favourite of mine over the years.Booking is essential.",

    "text": "One of few decent, reasonably affordable options in Victoria. That being said, a two course business lunch with soft drinks and water only still came in at \u00a340 a head. It's a relatively soulless barn of a space under a large hotel / office building, light and bright enough on the sunniest day of the year but little ambience delivered by the large plate glass windows staring out on the traffic choked Grosvenor Place. The decor feels a little scuffed and tired round the edges these days, and the confusing, tatty menu piles three special menus on top of the banqueting options on top of the a la carte. The \u00a317 set lunch needs to be asked for separately however.I went for two from their seasonal Street Food Festival menu, unsure of what this was linked to but the options looked interesting enough. Kai Nok-krata Tord or Quail egg Wanton was a bit of a one trick pony. Pleasant enough, though a little cloying after a while, the portion containing six of the little orbs, hard boiled and fried in wanton skin, my anaemic chilli sauce had me eying a neighbours satay avariciously. The satay and associated chicken skewers were pronounced quite as good as anything my colleague had eaten recently in Thailand.My main was more interesting, deep-fried sea bass with a mango salad. The former came a touch over-fried for my taste, the accompanying chewy mouthfeel tasty for sure, but killed the sea bass a little. The green mango salad worked alongside, a cooling mix of crunchy matchsticks contrasting with the heat of the fish. Elsewhere they didn't seem to compromise on flavour for pedestrian local taste buds either. Other dishes receiving plaudits round the table included a robust Massaman Lamb Shank curry, thick, creamy and almost aggressively spiced with the soft lamb falling off the bone.Wines are fairly punchy in their ambition. I'm not sure I'd waste a premier Bordeaux on such spicy fare but if you would, then they're all here and priced as you'd expect. There's plenty around the \u00a318 - \u00a330 mark too though the professional workers (or those with bosses) weren't able to imbibe.Overall, it's difficult to fault the food that we had, though I might chose differently next time. Big portions of fresh and authentic, well spiced Thai banqueting specialities. But you'll pay handsomely for the privilege and if not stuck in Victoria with no escape I wouldn't necessarily travel for it. The ambience, decor and tightly packed tables rule out romantic rendezvous too. If you're craving expensive Thai in Victoria, Michelin starred Nahm on West Halkin Street is also worth a thought.",

Best dish: By far the most flavorful was the Tom yum. It had mushrooms and shrimp in a thick coconut broth. It's spicy so be warned. Worst dish: Sea bass was over cooked and over priced at \u00a320. Doesn't come with rice and all you get is about a palm sized portion. I've had better quality sea bass for less.

Food is served with attention to presentation with the tofu starter, Pandan-leaf-wrapped chicken and egg mesh on top of the Pad Thai being visual highlights. The roast duck is very much a Cantonese dish and the seafood noodles are basically seafood ho fun. There is nothing wrong with the content of the dishes and they are of decent size but at the same time there was nothing extraordinary about them. My friends and I did not try any curry so cannot comment on that.\u00a0Overall the price of the food seems a little extravagant for what is the type of food that you could essentially find at a typical restaurant in Chinatown. This seems more of a venue to impress a date with or to have a celebration with with one of their fancy-clad cocktails.",

We asked for a refill on our prawn chips and they didn't bring it until we were finished with our meal. It was also a slow night for them so no excuse as to why it took them so long to deliver our appetizers, and finally our main entrees. However...they were quick to ask us if we wanted more bottled water. Unfortunately I'm not a big fan of having to pay nearly $5 (around $6 us) for a bottle of water that only filled two half glasses. We ordered the sampler appetizer plate for two, a prawn papaya salad, a single order of prawn Tom yum soup, a seafood stir fry, and a chicken pad Thai...bill came out to $94 (us $118). They tried to include a service charge of 12.5% on top of that cost too and there was only two of us, and our sleeping baby in her stroller. RIDICULOUS!! All I can say is that I've had better takeout Thai food from a random hole in the wall (I'm from Los Angeles where great Thai food is in abundance). If you are going to service charge two people, then I suggest you offer better service....or at the very least offer better portions for the prices you charge. Not worth the price...and not worth the time. I wish I actually had the chance to review the yelp ratings before we went to this place.",

    "text": "Nice restaurant with good food (with lots of interesting dishes on the menu, as well as the classics) and service but ultimately it's very expensive for what it is. I would say if you want reliable Thai food and don't care about the price, this is good, but otherwise there just have to be other options that are better value. I enjoyed the sharp and spicy flavour tom yum soup but found my salad less interesting.",

    "text": "The two most recent reviews really do not do The Mango Tree justice, I think they're a bit too harsh. Our experience was a a solid 3.5, though alas I have to round down in this case. They provide 'good' Thai food, with an above average experience from the staff, though not quite enough to tip the scales. Pad Thai was on the spot and a solid performer. The Sea Bass was quite good actually, with fresh mango / \u00a0chilis etc. in a lovely sauce. The Larb Gai was a bit heavy tasting for Thai food, though not unpleasant. For a nice finish to the meal we had a selection of their sorbet, with the highlight being the Lemograss version. Very good.",

The aesthetics of the restaurant created a mystic yet intimate environment which paralleled our meals extremely well. Pop, our server, provided renowned service and catered to our every need alongside special meal requests. He and his team were extremely polite and professional with every move. We highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area and it is worthy of even a greater rating.",

    "text": "I have visited 'The Mango Tree' on two occasions. My first experience was better than my second. Based on the second, I wouldn't go again.Food: The food is in general good. I think though it all depends on what you get. The first time I went we ordered loads of starters and I they were good. The second time I went for main dishes too. The chicken for one was didn't taste great and I ended up eating just the vgetables.Service: The service was quite good the first time I went (late dinner). The second time (early dinner/ late lunch), there were a lot of trainees. We had a menu in for quite some time and kept on trying to get our waiters attention for 15 mins. I felt like were were forgotten!Price: This place is pricey. The portions are small. This isn't a place where you get value for money. If you go for an early lunch, then there is a 'discounted' menu which makes it more worth it. Ambience: The staff in general is helpful and polite. The decor is okay but nothing to write home about.",

The curry entrees are all amazing and they offer very diverse and delicious options for starters. \u00a0The wine selection is extensive which is always a good sign as they take pride in their customers dinning experience. \u00a0When dinning at The Mango Tree it feels as if you are are sitting in an up scale restaurant and you're treated as such too. It's a large room which can accommodate a good amount of people but call ahead anyway because it fills quickly. \u00a0On most nights they close at 11PM which has saved me a couple time while entertaining colleagues after late night meetings. \u00a0If you like Thai and Stir Fry, The Mango Tree is a must try.",

Opentable currently has a 50% off deal as well when you order a main and starter which makes this place pretty sweet at the moment. The Kor Moo Yang was surprisingly good as well as the Tom Ka Goong.",

If you like Thai food you will not be disappointed and if in the area I heartily recommend giving this place a go.",

    "text": "My small office came here for a Christmas party dinner. The food was good, but nothing super special, especially considering the price. They also were pretty sneaky about getting money out of us, knowing that it was on a company card and several of us were increasingly smashed as the night went on. First, the waitress asked everyone what their first course would be, instead of whether we'd even like a first course. Sneaky. We ordered one bottle of wine, but then they just kept bringing out more and refilling our glasses without asking with new bottles. I had to keep turning them away because I didn't want to drink very much. The bill turned out to be much larger than what we'd actually asked for.It seems like they make a lot of their money from the drinks here, as they have a bar too, and the wine I had was good. They don't put as much effort into their food as one might expect with this price range. Maybe this is a smart business practice, but it doesn't leave me with a very good feeling. Plus their service was often slow, and they seemed especially reluctant to refill our water glasses, which is a huge irritant to me especially when people are drinking alcohol.The ambiance is lovely - I especially enjoyed the Christmas trees, lights, and Christmas music - but I probably won't be coming back, with all the other choices of restaurants I have in London.",

We were touring the city and we had seen this place on a Gordon Ramsey show, we noticed this place was close to where we were going to be so we decided to give it a try. We came in for lunch and they had just opened. They brought us complimentary prawn skins but we are vegetarians so we couldn't eat those. \u00a0Our meal was very mediocre at best. We thought it would have been so much better and would have had a few better options for us but we were wrong. The place was nearly empty and they sat two loud and annoying business men directly next to us as if there were no other seats. The staff was helpful and pretty friendly.

    "text": "I'm very judgemental most Thai food outside of Thailand. I will nearly always find some fault in authenticity (as much as I hate that word because wow snobbery), but I also understand restaurants need to work within the confines of both what's available and what's expected, and I think The Mango Tree does this.The vegetarian menu is completely vegan, which is a nice contrast to most Thai restaurants where fish and oyster sauces are considered fair game in the veggie department. My meal included the som tam, a favourite when I am in Thailand. The salty/sour/sweet balance was perfect, but it lacked chili and yard long bean chunks and could have done with something funky to replace the lack of fish sauce (although the dish wasn't completely devoid of that flavour profile).For my main I enjoyed the choo chee aubergine, which was rich and gorgeous as a choo chee sauce should be.Despite sounding negative about the place, I would quite happily return. It's rare to find Thai food that's remotely like what you'd get in Thailand (news flash: green curry does not exist on every Thai menu), but The Mango Tree will please the wider population, with a few dishes for devoted Thai food fans, and it's really nice to see a mainstream restaurant promoting a vegan friendly selection of dishes.P.S. the cheap house white is not worth it. Spend a couple quid extra to drink not that.",

So when i was in charge of organising a celebratory work dinner, i knew this was my chance to feast!!The reservation process was quite easy, and the staff were super friendly and helpful. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by smiley faces, who were very welcoming. After putting our coats in the cloak room, we were shown to our table. Majority of our group were having the set menu, however a few of us had allergies and needed to order from the al a carte menu. The wait staff were extremely knowledgeable in all the dishes, and were quick to offer suggestions that would suit our needs. The one thing i did notice was the amount of wait staff. Although there were a heap, you didn't feel pestered or \"watched\" over the course of the meal. I can highly recommend the set menu, it has very generous servings, and is great value for money. Also from the dessert menu, the lemongrass chili and lavender rose sorbet was the highlight of the night. Even though we had a little mix up with desserts and the cloak room, the overall experience was not tarnished by these things. Two big thumbs up!!",
