I wished we could've continued eating without getting full. There was so much chicken on the salad and the risotto plate was very filling for a man. The interior was light with Roman artwork. Very rich cheesy ravioli. The pizza was about 15\" diameter and my 11 year old ate it all and scarfed down garlic bread afterward. Tempted to get desserts too. The bill came up to \u00a350 which seemed like a lot for lunch, but seems to be the standard in London.",

Good pannini, mainly toasted, some pasta to take away as well but you have to wait. There is a cafe side and a restaurant side were you can have lunch for less than \u00a315 with a pasta, a drink and a coffee. The deco is not great but it has character. The place is always busy and buzzy. Italian staff mainly so get ready to talk football (perfect if you support Juventus in Italy and Arsenal in the UK). They are always friendly, except when Italy loses against France. I have been going there less for the past couple of years. Maybe because each time I go now they talk about the last World Cup",

I decided to get a takeaway but I was standing there for a good five minutes before a staff member spoke to me because there was some confusion about whether I was part of a larger group. That's all fine and forgiven.I ordered spaghetti to take away, which took a while - but I'll attribute that to them actually cooking the pasta to order rather than just microwaving a bowl of it. So some credit due there. As for the pasta, it was fine. It was a red sauce with some meat rather than a proper meat ragu. So all in all, it was fine with some concessions. But that's it.",

I came here recently and had a nice chicken breast sandwich (unfortunately my first choice had run out that day!), and only realised as I was leaving that I'd actually been there before, two years back with my family. We'd sat inside in the restaurant area for some pre-Buckingham Palace food. This time, I only popped in to look at the menu and get food - which turned up and was great. Being sat outside had upsides (the sun! a breeze!) but also downsides (taxi fumes and tourist herds passing by), but out-or-in, it's a nice spot. I'd recommend this over the Royal Quarter Cafe (just opposite) for price, taste and portion size.It is definitely \"tired\" inside, but for a quick (or not-so-quick) lunch spot, you can easily get over that and just enjoy your food.",

I ordered a caesar salad, garlic bread, and olives. Everything was fresh and delicious and my order was ready to go in less than 10 minutes. Service was friendly and polite.I always have a hard time choosing restaurants when I'm really hungry because I worry I'll be disappointed. If I haven't been there before, haven't heard good reviews, or haven't been recommended by a friend, I usually won't eat dinner at a random place.Although I only ordered a salad and some extras, I can tell by what I ate that the quality of their food is very good. I wish I had the time to dine in and try some of their wines.",

    "text": "Very nice place located very close to Buckingham palace. We stopped into this restaurant after having been at the changing of the guard. It caught my eye because of how nice the appearance of this restaurant was. The three of us sat down and ordered some still water and a couple of Pepsi's. We decided to just ordered one pizza (Bon Gusto) and split it between the three of us because we had a reservation later in the day and we didn't want to be stuffed. Let me just say the waiter who had been serving us was super nice and understanding. When he brought the pizza over he had already cut it into pieces for us to share. We thought this was really considerate because they are smaller pizzas not meant to be shared. The pizza was delicious. I prefer thin pizzas that are coal fired. I find that you can always taste more flavors and they're not overrun by the dough. Very nice experience and very nice staff.",

Despite being an Italian cafe, they do have a full English breakfast on their menu, which I ordered since that is what I was what I was planning on having anyways. (They also have an Italian take on the traditional English breakfast, substituting Italian cuts of meat for the bacon for instance.) Either coffee or tea is included in the meal; I ordered a cappuccino, it being an Italian cafe and all. Buttered sourdough toast is also included.The breakfast had two eggs, cherry tomatoes, bacon, sausage, baked beans, mushrooms, and a hash brown. Everything was cooked well and appropriately seasoned. The coffee was also pretty good.",
