    "text": "So I was on the hunt for homemade wheat free/gluten free pizza and came across Cotto. It's not far from my place on the train so we headed out there for dinner. We were greeted by the owner with a giant basket of freshly baked bread, which I turned down because of my wheat allergy and the owner said, \"You must tell me right away, I will take care of you!\" and he had some fresh and hot gluten-free bread brought to me right away. What a treat!!!! This is a fantastic Italian family owned establishment with all the charm and fantastic service that you find in Italy. And the food! Superb! My husband had the Penne Arrabiata, and I had a Gluten Free Vegetarian Pizza. Both were absolutely excellent. The veggies on the pizza were crispy and delicious, the sauce and cheese were wonderful and the crust was crispy around the edges. The owner took the time to have about a 20 min chat with us, inquiring about my allergy and telling us that he had been Celiac for many years. I could not fit dessert into my preggy tummy, but my husband had the mint and chocolate ice cream which was spectacular! I had a bite, and I've never had ice cream that was as light as a mousse. Brilliantly done. Not only that, but over half the desserts on the menu were gluten free. Not just the typical gluten free fare either...they had tiramisu for goodness sake! I highly recommend this restaurant for WF and GF as well as non-allergy folk as well! It's a nice friendly laid back atmosphere, reasonably priced, and caters to those of us who are normally left out when it comes to Italian fare! Go there now! x",

    "text": "This place is a family business: run by a family from Naples (the pizza capital) they have family members working in almost every job at the restaurant and you can hear them speaking Italian to each other. They're excited about food and to have you in their restaurant. For the wheat eaters, my dining companion said the pizza and bread are solid renditions of classic dishes, but I can't comment on that personally.They can get pretty busy on weekend nights, so it can be a good idea to call in advance to reserve a table. Can't hurt to mention if you'll be ordering a gluten-free pizza -- apparently this helps them plan how much to make.Gluten-free notes: This place is gluten-free mecca. Bread, pizza, pasta, you can eat it all! And also, the owner (and perhaps a few other family members) have celiac disease so you know you can order without having to ask a bunch of questions.The menu has two columns on it, one indicating the price for a normal dish and the other indicating the price for the gluten-free version. (For dishes that are naturally gluten-free, the prices are the same. For gluten-free versions of things like pizza, it's a few pounds more to make up for the higher cost of ingredients.)When the Italians do gluten-free, corn is their grain of choice and it shows here. The bread is corn-based (slightly reminiscent of an American cornbread) and they serve it toasted with butter. The cornmeal pizza crust has a great flavor and crunch, though as you could imagine it's a bit heavier than the wheat crust. Still tasty. I heard the gluten-free tiramisu was excellent though I was too stuffed to try it.You'll also find lots to talk about with your fellow diners. The word has gotten out about the gluten-free options here and you'll probably find yourself swapping tips with the table next to you.",

I thought it was laid on a little thick for my liking. Perhaps I've been in the city for too long. As for the food, it was alright. Edible, bog standard Italian, but certainly not enough for me to think it was worth paying or coming back for. We chose it because it was close to a venue where the Christmas party was located but sadly, it wasn't to be. The bread was nice though.",

Casual place with very good food -- my favorite combination. \u00a0 \u00a0The best Italian places to me are not about showiness or presentation - to me, the Italian food experience is great food, humble service, and a warm, human experience. \u00a0 Cotto and its owner Lino provide this wonderfully.We were surprised at how many customers coming in seemed to be repeats. Additionally, they are able to provide hands-down the best gluten-free Italian meal anywhere because the owner himself is celiac (intolerant of wheat). This made my son, who suffers from celiac, immediately at ease and he requested we eat there again the next night. Not a fancy place, not the place for a 25th anniversary dinner, but wonderful for just about any other occasion.(note: visit date February 2009)",

We'd called a few pubs but they weren't open to having our 15 month old there on a Friday evening (which we understand). We booked Cotto at the last minute and were so pleased. Our daughter had the avocado and prawn starter which was really tasty and substantial. I had the Octopus - and was delighted with the spicey kick. Followed by the lobster pasta - which was enough to fill up by boyfriend after his delicious lamb chops. The house wine was great and our GF friend was very surprised with the range of GF food. The best part of the evening was how fabulous the staff were. Not only at their proper jobs, but they played with our daughter while we ate. They were so friendly with her, she didn't want to leave (or even come back to the table to join us). Will definitely be coming back here on our next trip to the UK.",

And the atmosphere was so comforting, God, I just didn't want to leave. On a 3-day trip to London, I heard about this hole in the wall, allergy friendly restaurant with gluten free pasta and other Italian food called Cotto. I have allergies to dairy and eggs, so I figured that I could find something I could have there. I looked up the location on Google Maps and took the Piccadilly Line and transferred to the \u00a0Bakerloo Line to Lambeth North. (Very short walk from there, just do that instead of walking all the way from Waterloo). I accidentally came about 15 minutes before opening time that day (6pm) but, even though he was eating, the owner graciously took me to a seat and asked for my order. After telling him about my allergies, he actually decided to make me a special shrimp pasta before anybody came so there was no contamination. While other restaurants have been friendly, they haven't gone this far. I then learned that the owner actually has celiac himself! What a great way to make use of allergies- opening a restaurant with gluten free food for people like yourself! Maybe I should do that one day......",

I've had some of the most memorable meals ever here mostly because of the kindness and warmth of the host/owner, Lino. There are garlicky olives to get you started, then bread & butter. I've had the eggplant parm (an appetizer but big enough for a meal), spaghetti bolognese, and gnocchi, all of which were stupendous and all of which are made in-house. The desserts make me weep - gluten free tira misu, panna cotta, or my new true love, the tartufo limoncello, which I will see in my dreams until I come back to London again. If you can't tell already, I just really love this place and it is always a treat to dine here.",

The restaurant wasn't full for a Monday evening, which was nice too.The food itself was deliciouso, both GF and non-GF (I tried the dishes my family ordered). We had wine, and many courses, including a delicious GF dessert that was on par with any \"normal\" dessert I've had.The only drawback to Cotto is the location, as most people aren't likely to stumble on it, and being on the corner of Westminster Bridge Road probably makes parking a bit tricky. Nonetheless, it's one place I would take anyone looking for GF, as well as anyone looking for \"normal\" Italian. Bravo!",

You're either banished to Bibim Baps, have to trawl for corn tacos, or scour the city in search of good steak and frites. So, rare is it to dine with a dinner date and get their coel(iac) of approval; just as rare is it to find a dish that doesn't revolve around rice. So when multiple choices of wheat free wonders present, go head babes: take your time. Essentially Cotto have carb(on) copied everything off the regular menu and made special versions safe for those with less veritable villi. So as a place that prides itself on it its selection of gluten free pasta, I'd take time to treat your guests of gluten-free honour with the good grace to mull over the menu and avoid pestering guests whilst choosing said pasta. Saying that, said guest of honour at the table certainly enjoyed what Cotto has finally caught up to do, but personally I could see past the gluten free gimmick. I found an overly salty/ sweet theme repeated, a tinned tomato taste in the sauces, ubiquitous across most of the dishes delivered and sadly there was something wrong where the starter to mains ratio of sauces were also unequivocally uneven in how saucy they were presented. My octopi was drowned in a sea of sweet tomatoes, but to start it was an unexpectedly huge dish!Then for mains, a disappointingly dry lacklustre prawn linguini seemed lazily made. If only I combined the two?! Cotto is warm, inviting, homely, but dare I say, tired. Cotto could do with shaking up the menu a bit, I mean would it kill to serve some marrow, some fresh anchovies? Think about portion size, presentation?Safe to say I'll no less be going back in the new year with some mate who's going gluten free after the glut fest of Christmas. *eye roll emoji*",

    "text": "I've had gluten-free versions of various dishes at many establishments in multiple countries and this was one of the worst. Cardboard doughy pizza, terrible. It's like they just bought the dough from the frozen gluten free section of some giant chain supermarket and slipped some cheese (and in my case, cheap mushrooms) on it. I've made better gluten free products from just slipping a generic flour mix in a bowl with some baking soda. If the prices were half what they are, it would be more understandable, but oof..to make matters worse, they clearly didn't care or say anything when they took away the barely eaten pizza off my partner. \u00a0And, to add insult to injury, as others have written, the waitress will try to offer you bread several times and never mention they charge for it. It was only after I asked her multiple times, \"I have heard you charge for the bread, is that correct?\" That she purported to understand then walked away. This practice reminds me of how they try to pinch you at every corner in less developed countries. Was I really in London or was this all a bad dream? Our stomachs hurt afterwards and instead we grabbed from cheap sushi from inside Waterloo Station, and were immediately more content. Avoid!",

    "text": "I went on a trip to London in late March of this year. We had checked out Cotto on Yelp a year before but couldn't make it before we left... so it became a high priority for us to go get their gluten-free pasta goodness before we return home.We journeyed by Underground to reach the restaurant and found it to be quite a walk from the Waterloo station but still worth the walk. Next time we'd take the extra time to transfer to the Bakerloo line since Lambeth is literally across the street. We were greeted by the owner who is the most delightful Italian man. He is celiac himself... so you can be certain that his gluten-free pasta is going to be on-point! He was excited to see someone in our party was gluten-free and shared his ideas on what the Mister should have for his dinner. The owner's warmth and excitement enhanced our entire experience and made the whole meal a perfect experience.Let's get onto the pasta... I am not celiac, so I didn't have to worry about gluten free. I settled on the regular fusilli con salicce with the house red. I found the pasta really good... but the sauce was where it was at! It was just absolutely delicious and I am sad I don't live in London so I could go all the time.We wrapped up our meal with some of the most delicious desserts... I chose the lemon sorbet.. served inside a hollowed out lemon coated in sugar and frozen. Yes, you read all of that correctly. If it's on the menu... get it!!So, whether you are a London local, or a tourist like me... whether you are celiac or a gluten-seeking fiend... check out Cotto and bring your appetite!",

    "text": "Cozy little family-run Italian joint blocks from the bustling Waterloo station serves great, filling fare at a decent price for London. Given the small space, reservations are probably a good idea, although the place is very informal and casual. The website helpfully provides a link for such.Let's jump right in to say that the spaghetti carbonara ($13.60 at the current one Pound per $1.50ish exchange rate) was declared one of the best pasta dishes ever by one finicky pasta prude in our party. Mercifully light on the bacon -- really more like pancetta anyway in this rustic prep -- but with plenty of velvety egg yolk, the tight, rich serving was incredibly filling and satisfying.Next, the four-cheese penne ($16) -- just a very rich, hearty prep that really hit the spot for anyone looking for a big, warming entree. Finishing it under a broiler gave it just the the right amount of brown and chew. You will wobble home.More complex was the crespoline ($16.60), basically fresh pasta filled with spinach and ricotta cheese, topped with tomato sauce and baked. Think Italian enchiladas. Acid and cream and goodness. Very nice little dish.Pizza fans? The Vesuviana (tomato, mozzarella, homemade sausage and peppers $18.35) does feature some great sausage, but otherwise the price point seems a little high for the dish, almost like a tourist \"pizza\" premium is in effect.Desserts were aces across -- the tiramisu, mint ripple, and sorbets were all great finishes to a simple, honest dinner. Of note the sorbets arrived in wonderful little fresh citrus skins that clearly spoke to an attention to detail which would please any foodie.Finally -- the gluten free pasta options have been highly praised by other Yelpers, but were not sampled by our party. Might be a decision maker for you.Bottomline, looking for a simple, filling, pleasant evening meal on the south bank of the Thames -- give Cotto a go.",

The cream sauce had a few layers of flavor that put the dish on the next level. \u00a0I'm typically not a huge prosciutto gal, but this was excellent. \u00a0The star of our meal was the tiramisu. \u00a0A fair sized slice, \u00a35 a piece, we shared one and it was perfect. \u00a0Excellent flavor without being overbearing.We love this family owned restaurant and always make a point to go out of our way to dine here. \u00a0Probably my best ever Yelp! find.",

( 4 of us) when the bill came, were were charged $1 pound /pax totalling $4 pounds. imagine for 1 sliced stale and cold and yucky pc of baguette. i complained to the manager who said..\"oh, its on the menu we always charge!\" then i said, no one told us and when the server brought the bread she never said if we take its an extra charge per person. she even justified it as its $1pound per person all you can eat bread!\" im like, but i just took 1 slice and its not even good! all manager said was...thats the way it is. anyhow, i said its no use arguing over $4 pounds. if thats the way you guys do business then thats it. you are cheating your customers and specially us coz we are tourists. i say everywhere i go to italian place, bread is always free, even at high end places. she just shrugged us off! they even proudly displayed the YELP sticker on their window. what a shame!! another trick, so we ordered the bacon carbonara, and guess what topping they placed on the pasta...ham!! i said why ham the menu said bacon! the server insisted it was bacon! so again, another cost cutting and dark side \u00a0tricks they are using. lastly, the risotto was another big joke! they used white rice and just simmered it down to become sauce/soupy like the texture of risotto! only good thing was the most the pizza. my taste. uds and experience dont lie! but the service and scamming that they are running with the bread service, pasta, and God knows what else is shameful. they should take the Yelp sticker out!! Do not eat here! they will try and scan every last $ they can!",

There are 3 totally non corn - fresh pasta dishes, the ravioli, gnocchi and something else. Do not buy a gluten free pizza here. It was in edible. Do not get the bread, they charge you for it.

It appeared that not ordering wine is a major downer on the service at this business and will result in less than stellar service.Edit: food finally came. It was really good!

I hope you appreciate this review before you are subjected to a very rude service.This is based on two couples experience on a cold december night.\u00a0We went to this place and ordered a mozzarella apetizer and pizza to start while we decided for our main entre and wine selection. Our order was taken by the main patron who appeared to be the owner. He also took with him all menus.After our apetizer and pizza arived we asked the server for a second menu which he provided with the following remarks: \"you should have ordered all at once... see, we do not like to go back and forth\"\u00a0To our surprise, the patron was talking to the three tables across about us and telling the rest of the restaurant guests that we had only ordered two things which was not enough to pay the service for the table...\u00a0All of this while the server was in essence refusing our order and kicking us out...\u00a0By that time we had all eyes on us... this while the owner continued making unprofessional, unethical, and erroneous coments about us.\u00a0This is the kind of service you should expect at this place.\u00a0This type of establishment is a disgrace to the restaurant industry,\u00a0 Londoners and Italian family culture and values.Arrogance, disrespect, disgusting attitude, unprofessionalism, unethical services, etc... all you are certaint to experience at this place.\u00a0By the way, i left \u00a320 tip and the guy didnt even say thank you.
