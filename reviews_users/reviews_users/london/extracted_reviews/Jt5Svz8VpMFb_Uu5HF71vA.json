Given that it's hidden behind the Tate Modern, I was surprised it wasn't more busy. It'd make for an ideal evening out that, bit of modern art followed by a hearty tapas style dinner.The food here was just as good as that experienced in other Leon branches, and I thought the service was great. Friendly and efficient staff are to be found here.It's also a quick walk from my office, so I expect I'll be in here for a few lunches. Hellloooooooo meatballs.",

The place is set up like a posh Mexican labourers' canteen with a good mix of intimate tables for two and big benches for the more communally-minded. It's bright and clean and very relaxed. The service is quick but the food isn't 'fast'. In fact the restaurant sells itself on fresh and simple dishes. I love the Moroccan Meatballs which is part of their hot meals lunch menu and these are all served with rice and their Spring Slaw. They also serve big wraps, salads and soup as well as cakes and tea and coffee. The meatballs will cost you \u00a32.50 and you get a good sized portion for this. If you are out and about around the South Bank I would highly recommend that you try this place.",

Located just behind the Tate you can either take out or sit on one of the comfy sofas which makes it handy for meetings or a catch up over lunch.The food is delicious - I often grab a wholesome porridge for breakfast which you can chose with a variety of toppings and they also do a wonderful granola yoghurt. Of course, if you prefer your brekkies a little more fulfilling (or to cure a hangover) they serve an amazing bacon bap which is healthier than most as the meat is grilled. Lunches include superfood salads and a great choice of wraps. They also have a yummy selection of cakes, brownies and muffins which are rather on the large side!This branch is large compared to some of the other branches and the staff are amazingly quick which makes the lunch time rush a lot less stressful!",

Even the tiles in the bathroom are nice. We arrived just as they we putting on their dinner menu, and honestly I wouldn't come here for dinner. Actually, I came here for tea and cake to cheer myself up after some not great news. But that didn't stop them explaining their dinner menu to us and being a tad patronising (basically exactly the same as their lunch menu, but smaller and without sides but not much cheaper). The staff were friendly though, so I shouldn't give them too much grief, it's not their fault I was being a grouch. Tea was excellent (I know, it's just tea, but a rubbish cuppa might just have pushed me over the edge), chocolate pie did what it was meant to do, but I've made better myself. Actually, I don't think they made this on sight, the pastry tasted bought-in. I'd come here for coffee, I'd come here for lunch. But dinner? Nah. Not entirely sure how a salad, cake, lemonade and tea came up to \u00a315 either. But I really really really like the building and it seems tasty good value for lunch. I'll come back for tea if Table over the road is a bit too busy.",

I seem to go less frequently only because I'm starting to get bored with the same type food. The prices are the greatest either so I tend to stick to the wraps. With only one veg option I tend to stick to chicken - commonly chili.The real highlight for me is the actual space. It's big and airy and I love the decor/style. I'm fascinated with their menu design and random artifacts stacked on shelves.I like the idea of young urban 'warriors' conducting their meetings here while they drink coffee and surf the net.

A visit to leon makes you feel good.I was delighted when I found this one close to my old work, and it quickly became a regular lunch stop. The only thing that stopped me eating there every day was the price, which is a little steeper than your average Pret meal, although soups are priced the same and there is a veggie and meat option daily. The menu changes seasonally and always includes wraps alongside some bigger meals, normally served with salad and brown rice. Currently, the halloumi and chilli wrap is my favourite.The drinks and sweets are also great especially the pecan pie and blackcurrant quencher.This particular Leon is really big compared to some and where you choose to sit will dictate what type of time you have - I personally like the area at the back to the right, where there is a row a little tables, a long leather bench and armchairs - it's really cosy and feels more secluded than the rest which is open and airy with huge glass windows.The staff are also really friendly which helps in the middle of a stressful day at work!",

I loved all the vegan/vegetarian options they have. Aside from food, they also have coffee as well which is perfect if you need a pick me up after tour meal.We tried the falafel wrap, waffle fries as well as the chicken wrap. The falafel wrap was incredibly unique and had great flavor! Even the the fish wrap was spot on as were the fries.

On a very busy day down by Tate Modern Leon was nice and relaxed and light - a nice place to escape from the crowds. I opted for a fish finger burger with fries and a lemonade. As always the food was super fresh and served up speedily. The fish fingers are probably the best I've tasted, and came on a bun with salad, pickles and a light tartar sauce. The fries, resembling deep-fried hashtags, were also really tasty and came with a selection of dips. I got plenty of food for around \u00a38.",

    "text": "Ok. So in the area and overall regarding prices in London, is not as expensive so I do recommend it as an option. Specially if you're visiting the Tate.Food is not great but not bad either. What I will warn you is the attitude of the staff. Condescending and rude. Not cool in my book. SPECIALLY if I'm tired and hungry.There's this blonde short haired girl... Avoid her. Let the younger brunette one be your server. Also the manager, leader or commander pretty rude as well. I recommended as a fast food stop area yes, but bring and keep your guard up as well. Space is nice and comfortable. Large room. IT HAS WIFI #Leon #London #CustomerService #Hello",

They seem to have though everything out, from showing calorie counts to even doing a bunless burger which includes everything apart from the bread.It's not the cheapest food avaliable, but it is good quality, cooked extremely quickly when the restaurant isn't too busy and tasty+filling.Tap water is avalible and the cucumber/lemons are a nice touch. I'm not a fan of their drinks though, which taste very watered down.My favourites are their quickly cooked lunch boxes avaliable all day. Chargrilled chicken and chorizo, and pork/chilli apple stew have not disappointed yet.",

I'm a big fan of their chargrilled chicken superfood salad and yes - their delicious lemonades though I do try to steer away from sugar and these are quite sweet.The service is efficient, though I do feel sometimes that they don't give you enough time to look at the menu and hush you to order in a very insisting manner if you're taking your time to ponder on the side.I also think that for a lunch place these days...you kinda have to provide nutrition facts - though I said 'healthy' in the beginning - it really is up to you to go online, check out their menu and see what the nutrition is like for whatever you wish to order.The atmosphere in this place is great - large glass windows, wooden / urban interior though I never have time do sit down there but I'm always tempted.However to explain my 3 stars - is lack of readily available nutrition facts, portion size (a bit too small for what you're paying) and hushing of the orders. I will go back there - just not too often.",

My chili chicken was grilled chicken with a red sauce and sour cream + pickled relish on a bed of brown rice for about 6gbp. Did I like it? Hard to explain. It definitely wasn't bad and was flavourful. The side of corn of the cob, about 2.5 gbp was really delicious though, which made me happy to be there. The fresh orange juice didn't taste so freshly squeezed.The food comes out right away. Essentially you just line up to order and they give you the pre-packaged hot steamy food you ordered without having to wait (even faster than mcdonalds). The portions are tiny. It was good for me for a lunch size, but if it were dinner and I was really hungry, I totally would have wanted something more. Not impressed.",

I found the menu quite confusing, so ordered a samon wholefood salad with lattice fries, I was told for 10p I could upgrade and get a freshly made lemonade so I did and this cost me the good side of \u00a312. For lunch, that's outrageous. I know I may have ordered the most expensive thing on the menu but that is besides the point. The food was really good and the area you eat in very laid back and furnished well but I would come to Leon more as a treat, than as a regular. With M&S just around the corner you can get a very similar quality meal and eat this outside the Tate watching the river for less than half the cost.",
