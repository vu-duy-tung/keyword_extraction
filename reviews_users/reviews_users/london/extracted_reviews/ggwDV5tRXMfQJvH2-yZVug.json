We started with a deliciously crisp Naan e Barbari, then Zhug, Harrissa, Burnt & Pickled Chilli, pillowy Jerusalem Bagel, Msabacha Chickpeas and lush Baba Ghanoush. The Goat Goulash was good, as was the Chicken Abu Kalmash. The Octopus Mashawsha was amazing and the Cauliflower Jaffa Style while the Capsicum Haloumi and Broccoli & Black Tahini were good. Never had mozarella and goats cheese for dessert but it seemed to work. The 2015 Albarino was very fruity as was the Chignin",

    "text": "Finally made it to The Barbary yesterday, when my friend and I made plans to catch up over dinner on a weekday and decided to try our luck at the no reservations counter dining spot. It's by the same people who run The Palomar, but this has a focus on the Barbary Coast (i.e. North Africa). I would really only recommend this place if you are a group of two and are really good friends / dating, because otherwise the queueing and dining situation can be a bit much, and I have no idea how they would ever make room for an odd numbered party (seats only really open up in twos). We arrived at 7 pm and were given an estimated wait time of 1 hour, but we were able to wait along the wall (like you do at Barrafina) and have wine and appetizers, so it was not bad at all. We ordered grilled halloumi and octopus kibbeh, the latter of which was basically falafel made with octopus and bulgur wheat and very tasty. We were seated after 40 minutes, and once you order the food comes out really quickly - we were also done with our meal in 40 minutes! First we ordered naan and a pumpkin dip from the Baking & Grinding section. The naan was super thin but other than that, it was basically a typical flatbread, and the dip was very nice. For mains we got the grilled chicken thighs, monkfish, octopus, and cauliflower dishes, all of which I highly recommend. There wasn't a single bad dish in the group (and probably on the menu!). And as dessert we shared the hashcake, which is a pistachio tart served with whipped cream. Service was great, and it was so much fun to watch the open kitchen, with the chefs dancing to the music and clearly having a lot of fun. Would definitely recommend if you come here with the right dining companion!",

    "text": "A resounding 5 stars and one of the best restaurants that I've been to in London. Be prepared to wait for a table, probably around 1-1.5 hours for dinner. Come with only 2-3 people in your party because it's a small restaurant and there are no tables, it's a U-shaped bar/counter seating. They don't take reservations, so just be prepared to wait (it's worth it!) and go early. While you wait, you can order a drink and 4 snacks (olives, haloumi fries, this mini pita bread stuffed with lamb & beef, and some spring rolls stuffed with salmon)TL;DR for what to order: If you're coming with 2 people, get 2 starters (definitely the mini pita bread with lamb + beef), one bread (naan or the Jersualem bagel), 2 dips, 1 meat dish, 1 vegetable dish, and 1 dessert. This should be enough food! The must-orders: mini pita bread, chicken, broccoli & black tahini, and the knafeh for dessert. My friend loved it so much he went there a second time that same week and said the pork neck is a must-order.I'd recommend getting either the haloumi fries or the mini pita bread -- we got both and they were delicious! I loved the mini pita bread stuffed with lamb and beef - I don't even like lamb but I liked these. They were stuffed and chargrilled and the most delicious little things I've ever had. Definitely getting these again. The haloumi fries were good, but I don't tend to like that kind of cheese as much - they were well spiced/seasoned and tasty, but I just didn't love these as much as the mini pita breads.I'd recommend getting either the naan or Jerusalem bagel with 2 dips/spreads. We picked the Jerusalem bagel which reminded me of a Turkish simit / almost like a pretzel covered with sesame seeds. Super fresh, served with some dukkah, and was really fluffy and soft. We picked the zhug / harissa dip and the pumpkin spread. Next time I might try the babaganoush or chickpeas. You can't really go wrong with any of these either. The pumpkin was a little sweet for my taste as a dip with the bread, but it was definitely something unique.For mains, we shared the chicken which was chargrilled and delicious, and a generous amount, served on top of some hummus. I'd highly recommend this to make sure you fill up with protein. We also got the broccoli with black tahini which was amazing - \u00a0I may have never had broccoli this good before. The chargrilled taste was spot on, and I loved the black tahini sauce.For dessert, the knafeh is hard to pronounce but everyone seems to get this dish. It's like a birds nest of phyllo dough stuffed with goat cheese and mozzarella cheese and with syrup - I don't like cheesy things that much for dessert, but this was amazing. I'd highly recommend this - it's super unique & delicious.I'll definitely be back here again - it's amazing. Watching the chefs cook everything in the open kitchen in the middle of the bar, the chargrilled taste of most things, and the freshness and uniqueness of the ingredients were great. I'd recommend this to anyone coming to London and can't wait to eat here again (and at Palomar). The price was fairly reasonable, I think it was around \u00a360 for 2 people.",

This is a tapas place so you order multiple dishes which is great because you get a taste of everything. Reservations can be made via their website but only for 12pm and 5pm. I showed up at 5pm on a Wednesday as a walk in and was able to be seated right away. It filled up quick after. Prob around 530 all seats were filled. This was a few min walk from the Palace Theaters where I was watching part 1 and part 2 of Harry potter. Great intermission dinner and was completely satisfied. Love their homemade nan the best witht theie various choices of dippings. Would so come back here when I get the chance.",

    "text": "Overpriced and Rude. First, the food they serve is very good. I liked the chickpeas, eggplant, and k\u00fcnefe (dessert). However, it is very overpriced. One of their staff was extremely rude to me. After I paid my bill, I wanted to use the bathroom, She stopped me at the back of the restaurant and asked where I am heading (perhaps thinking I'm a bum who breached the greeter/security at the front door). I expresses my desire to use the bathroom but she would not budge. I explained I just finished my dinner here. Her response: \"Did you really now, which table?\" I should mention there are no tables at this place, everyone sits around the bar, facing the cooking area. I pulled the receipt out of my pocket and finally she let me in with not much shame. I don't know what made her believe I don't belong there, my Mediterranean complexion, or slight beard, but then they serve food from my country, not to my people apparently. After paying 50 pounds, this was very insulting. If I wanted to pay loads of money to get insulted, I would go to a French restaurant :)",

    "text": "The Barbary is a bit hidden along a smaller footpath, and dark and mysterious looking among the whimsical brightly painted walls and storefronts in the vicinity. I circled around the area for perhaps 10 minutes before I noticed the small plaque marking the hotspot. I stepped inside and put myself on the waitlist for a table for two, and the hostess said it would be max one hour. One must wait at the site, as opposed to leaving one's number. My friend and I ended up waiting about 90 minutes until two seats finally freed up. At this point, my stomach was ragingly empty and expectations high. From the beginning, it was clear that The Barbary sets itself apart by its unique physical layout and culture. In addition to being dark, inside they play loud American pop music that combines with the busy sounds of the kitchen, center stage in the little space. Our server arrived promptly and confidently offered his opinion on the best way to design our meal i.e. bread plus spread and 3-4 entrees, and even going so far as to recommend switching dishes based on redundant or complementary flavors. While the wait to get into the restaurant was arduous, the crew works like a well oiled machine and the dishes come out swiftly and logically once one orders.My favorite dishes were the halloumi and neck meat. They gave the halloumi nice thick grill marks and doused it with savory oils; it's reminiscent of string cheese in flavor but whereas I couldn't eat the latter in big bites--and don't even like cheese all that much in general--I found myself excitedly munching on chunks of halloumi. I definitely want to incorporate it in my pantry at home now. The next best dish was the petra negra neck meat. It was cooked medium rare yet had a nice char outside, and came with a sweeter sauce and soft roasted garlic. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The food is incredible, but the most memorable aspect of The Barbary was the staff. They were jamming to the music all night long, especially the woman bartender in front. They even took shots with the guests! When the bartender slid two tiny goblets to us with a wink, it certainly made me feel special. The way the 25 or so total seats form a ring around the chefs highlights the labor and technical skill that goes into cooking mastery. Watching them enjoy their work and interact with patrons made the night; it must be their love that makes the food taste so good.",

    "text": "Went here with a friend after making a reservation for 5pm about 2 weeks prior to arriving to London. Thankfully we did as this place only does a couple of seatings and it was packed.After perusing the menu, we decided to split a few items:Jerusalem bagel (4 stars): This was an interesting starter that was so buttery and had strong spices.Chickpeas (4 stars): The chickpeas were also very good. The natural flavor was there and then elevated a bit with some delicious spices.Cauliflower (4.5 stars): I am a huge fan of cauliflower and this dish did not disappoint--great flavors all around.Filled pastries (4.5 stars): I can't remember exactly what these were called, but they were stuffed with some sort of meat mixture (I think lamb and beef) and served with a chimichurri-type sauce. Overall, the dish was excellent.Black salmon (4.5 stars): The fish was cooked perfectly and the chef let the flavors of the fish speak for themselves. One of the best salmon dishes I've had.Pata Negra (5 stars): This was easily the best dish I had during the European trip. This is a must order as the meat is so tender and flavorful, unlike anything I've had before.Knafeh (4 stars): We finished with the signature dessert and it was a nice close to the meal, but nothing to write home about.Overall, this was one of the best meals I have had in a while and it did not break the bank. This place is unique in that all of the seating is around a bar and you get to see the food cooked right in front of you. The head chef even checked in with us several times throughout the meal, which was a nice touch. This is definitely a place worth checking out if you're in London.",

Such good thought went into each dish. The restaurant is small and only has approx 20 bar stools. You sit around the small kitchen and watch the chefs cook, which was cool to see. We came at 9pm and there happened to be two available seats at the bar and we only had to wait 2 min to be seated, that we were elated about because we had read that the wait times could be up to one hour. I guess it was good that we came so late in the evening. :)The Barbary will be on my first stop the next time we come to London. Better believe it!",

Open kitchen concept, small, very friendly, creative epic food, and really just \u00a0all around wonderful... even the prices are fair! Note though... they are BUSY all the time. Getting a table is not easy, especially if you have a larger group. It's worth every penny though if you can get in!",

    "text": "The Barbary is amazing. I love the food at Machneyuda, and was excited to try another of the chef's restaurants on a trip to London.Waiting for seats was a tad annoying, but we ordered glasses of wine and posted up in a corner, so it honestly wasn't bad. We waited about 45 min in total, at 6pm on a Saturday, which was fine. Service was friendly and efficient, and it was fun to watch all of the food being made in front of you as you eat.The food was all incredible -- the naan and jerusalem bagel were great, as were all the dips we ordered for them. Lamb cutlet, cauliflower and halloumi were our remaining favorites.Highly recommend!",

One of the most amazing meals I've ever had the pleasure of eating and definitely my best in London for sure. Staff was stellar and I even was treated to a little complimentary shot (it was my birthday). My server (I have a bad memory I apologize) was from Greece and he was awesome. Close to the theater since we were headed there afterwards. I will dreaming of this place until next time London! Thank you to the staff for making it such a memorable night.",

    "text": "I went twice this week! I love their sister restaurant, The Palomar in Soho, so I had to try their new opening in Neal's Yard. It's really small with a U-shape bar counter seating. No reservations, so walk in early when they open. I first came at 12:15pm for lunch on a Thursday and didn't have to wait. Second time was 5:45pm on a Saturday night and waited 45 minutes. By the time we left, the wait was about 2 hours long at 8:00pm. Counter seats about 20 people I think. Service was attentive and so friendly. They're always refilling water, drinks, very quick food service, and all with a smile. Food was delicious! More tapas style than Palomar, but very beautifully presented and each dish was substantial. Get the haloumi fries, baba ganoush, naan, chicken, lamb, salmon, fattoush salad and aubergine. All were amazing. Salmon was on the smaller side and I think was the weakest dish.For dessert, I had the tart, which came with cream and was delicious. For drinks, the wine list is solid. Will definitely be back and often.",

The staff is friendly and informative. They make the meal fun. We had most of the things on the menu. All good. I would say explore.",
