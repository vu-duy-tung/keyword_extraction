I think i like the dark and cosy japanese restaurants more, but its still smart little place.",

Katsu curry, sticky rice, honey potatoes, sesame green beans, miso soup, edamame and some of the most melt-in-my-mouth salmon sashimi I've indulged in outside of Japan were beautifully presented in front of me. What commenced can only be described as dirty - an every yelper for him/herself mentality of chop-sticking, slurping, scraping, stuffing and chomping our ways through three amazingly different, yet equally fantastic authentic Japanese cuisine. You know the feeling when you just don't want a meal to end? Or you just want your stomach to be a bottomless abyss that never fills simply so that you can keep tasting all of the glory that you're putting into it? Then head immediately to Yoshino. You'll find that lovin' feeling here.",

The restaurant itself is a really lovely, calm dining environment and does not have the slightly 'rushed' feeling of some sushi bars, partly due to its location.The food is always outstanding, and has a great choice of dishes even for me as a vegetarian (I gather it's even more amazing for those who eat fish). Not the cheapest in town, but ideal for a treat.I'm not sure if the restaurant's satellite take-away bars are still open, but there used to be a small branch in Piccadilly that served the most mouth-watering sushi at lunchtime. It was all freshly made and yet cheaper than the plastic-tasting stuff you'd buy in supermarkets. Also highly recommended.",

They specialise in sushi and sashimi, and at lunchtime do a good range of Bento (fixed-menu lunch boxes). Vegetarian sushi is available (but not in a bento version). Lunch about \u00a310-\u00a315, dinner about \u00a330-\u00a340 with wine. Wines start at a very reasonable \u00a312.80 for a French Merlot, and \u00a313.50 for Sauvignon Blanc. As you might expect, the decor is minimalist and restrained, and the service is very fast. Most of the clientele at lunch time seem to be Japanese - always a good sign. The only criticism is that the kitchen is very inflexible about making changes to the menu (even though, in my case, they had said on the telephone that they could). A good point is that the menus can be visited on-line in full - prices included.",

    "text": "After having my haircut at Yoshi Inamura (shoutout) yesterday, I went to Yoshino. \u00a0Hey, it was only appropriate. \u00a0Yoshino is tucked away in Piccadilly Place, just off the North side of Piccadilly (between Piccadilly Circus and Swallow Street), thus it's easy to miss, even if it does have a neon sign proclaiming \"SUSHI\" hung outside. \u00a0Finding good sushi in London is usually a) difficult, and b) expensive, and unfortunately, it's one of those foods for which my standards have been massively inflated after a marvelous experience with my cool aunt in Singapore (made all the more marvelous as there was a Ferrari involved). \u00a0However, after two visits, I've found that Yoshino holds its ground and is possibly my favourite sushi place in London.So, the food. \u00a0First off, I love the miso soup, which comes with a prawn head floating in it. \u00a0In a country where some places somehow (I'm looking at you, Pret) ruin miso, Yoshino does spot on - as just miso soup, it'd be damn tasty, but the prawn head just gives it that extra oomph. \u00a0Apologies to all you veggies. \u00a0We had a plate of otoro (medium fatty tuna belly) which was quite decent, although admittedly I did detect that it wasn't fresh fresh fresh and still gently...doing whatever it is fish do. \u00a0Still, it was better than most of the sushi I've had in town. \u00a0We also got a sushi roll platter which was nice, the small dollops of sauce on top contrasting nicely with the filling (they're also pretty big - you can't quite bite into them, but it'd be problematic if you have a small mouth. \u00a0Not that having a small mouth is a bad thing or anything. \u00a0Ok, someone take my shovel off of me.) \u00a0Yoshino also offer yakitori on their dinner menu which you order by the skewer - we tried the quails eggs and pork rolls (they're wrapped in pork fat), which were good but I couldn't help but think that it needed an extra dimension of flavour, and miso aubergine, one of my favourite Japanese dishes (talking of which, my friend pronounces this OR-ber-jeen, which I find hilarious.) \u00a0I've also tried the tempura here when I went with my mum, and I remember that being very good.On top of this the service was friendly, albeit a bit difficult to communicate with (I think she was Italian, not quite sure). \u00a0At \u00a325 a head, it's not horrendous price-wise; sure, it's pricier than Kulu Kulu and suchlike, but it's still better than some of the swankier places I've been to. \u00a0Plus that prawny miso soup makes everything better. Trust me.",

    "text": "Another week, another Japanese restaurant. It seems like that is all I have been reviewing recently but when a friend proposed a new sushi joint I couldn't say no. Yoshino is hidden just off Swallow St. in a small side alley. I was quite amused that as we walked past Gaucho's the huddled demi-celebs eyed us suspiciously trying to figure if we were somebody famous.Once seated in the plush surroundings we were presented with the restaurants sophisticated menu. There seemed to be a slight language barrier as we ordered from our Japanese waitress but she made up for it by being very courteous throughout. Whilst drinking some hot sake and green tea we set off sampling a variety of dishes available. Though we debated ordering the tomato miso soup out of sheer curiosty we eventually settled on the more conventional regular miso although this was particularly fresh, a sign of things to come. The Chirashi Sushi was served in flamboyant and original fashion with a selection of incredibly fresh sashimi pieces presented in oyster shells with fancy rice receiving an equally fancy presentation in a matching side dish. We also ordered the tuna carpaccio which proved to be delicious literally melting in your mouth. Perhaps the dish could have done with a little bit more dressing but considering how fresh the fish was that might have been a disservice. It was interesting to note that nigiri pieces were presented in single portions as opposed to the 2 per plate that I have become accustomed to but my single piece of eel was certainly worth it. We also ordered a few side dishes like edamame and tempura which continued the high standard the restaurant had set with the other dishes and were again incredibly fresh.For desert I decided to experiment with the green tea tiramisu which was essentially tiramisu with a green tea powder mixed in. Despite the contrasting tastes this dish actually worked quite well. Ultimately Yoshino provided a fine dining experience in plush surroundings and as such can be considered on the pricey side of things. I had not seen my friend in a long time so we decided not to hold back and perhaps under different circumstances I would have been more parsimonious with my order.Having said that, unlike in other establishments like Nobu, we didn't have to take out a mortgage to pay for our meal and if you are being realistic the food Yoshino has to offer is neck and neck in both freshness and presentation with the Berkeley square institution.",

We tried the Yoshini Zen Yuki set meal for \u00a39.80 \u00a0grilled crispy skinned mackerel (just watch out for the bones), 3 fresh tuna rolls, sashimi salad in wasabi miso dressing, crunchy green bean and sesame salad, sunomono (a thinly sliced salad of radishes marinated in rice vinegar), potato salad, pickles and home made miso soup. All were presented in 3 shiny, lacquer boxes lined up across the table. For \u00a39.80, this was an absolute bargain. Alternatively, fried chicken or fried tuna are offered in place of the mackerel. Colourful sushi and sashimi platters range from around \u00a316 - \u00a330 and we also witnessed some fantastic looking tempura dishes (ranging from \u00a33.80 - \u00a311.80). If you work nearby, this would be a great option for the super cheap lunch time deals starting at around \u00a35.80. Or they do take away. The interior is a bit sterile upstairs, but full of happy customers, even on a Monday night. I prefer the ground floor sushi bar which has more character. Service is friendly and unobtrusive, and the ambience is unpretentious and casual. Yoshino also has a store, Delicatessen Yoshino, which sells fresh sushi at 59 Shaftesbury Avenue (near Chinatown).",

This sushi place is the first I've been to in London. It's also the first time I've really really enjoyed sushi.

For \u00a310 I got tempura chicken, sticky rice, tuna shashimi (is sashimi always tuna? I don't know), rolls and pickly and veg and lots of other little bits. That's a lot of food for a tenner and depiste my misgivings about the Japanese grub, this place might sway me.

I would recommend trying to book a seat at the fish counter so that you can watch the meals being prepared. I would highly recommend going for Omakase (chef's choice) as the selection I have had has been remarkable. If you go in the evening the chef is usually a delightful older Japanese man who I would like to adopt as my grandfather. He can cut fish very well and I could watch him inspect the raw fish at the counter for hours. I think the best thing though is the new take away option that they have for lunch. It is definitely the best take away sushi in London both in terms of quality and value for money. Try the tempura spicy sweet potato maki. Yum. Book ahead if you want to eat here, it is starting to get busy. Oh, the green tea ice cream is the best I have had in London. Creamier than most.",

This place has been a well kept secret The first time I tried Yoshino (with a friend who works very close and for whom this is almost a cantine!), I simply found it outstanding. Apparently the place has been redone recently, expanding the 1st floor with a bunch of tables for 2 and a long bright yellow banquette (in a kind of fake leather but the result is better than it sounds). I arrived with the restaurant mostly empty apart from a few Japanese people and I kind of felt in a little restaurant in Tokyo. The staff is absolutely lovely, very helpful, smiling and (amazingly in London) seeming to really care to provide the best service they could. The food was excellent, I went for the Yoshino zen set menu, which includes grilled fish, tuna sashimi, hot rice and miso soup. All very fresh, tasty and nicely presented. But the best piece of news is that this excellent food, service and overall experience came at \u00a39.50 for this set menu! Add in a green tea and service and you can have a great hot lunch in central London in a nice and comfortable place for \u00a313. I will definitely come back (as their menu says they are credit-crunch friendly!). Yoshino, which is very close to Piccadilly Circus, is always full of Japanese people, which is always a good sign. They have also just started a take-away service that must be good too.",

Anyways, we weren't here on one , we were here for the food! . I had the bento box that came with shrimp tempura, seaweed tuna salad, miso soup and sushi rolls. All for 25\u00a3. A bit on the more expensive side but totally worth it. My friend had a bottle of sake, and many different appetizers that just seemed like a lot of food. Our bill was on the high end so be ready to spend some cash. Service is top notch.",

    "text": "Very conveniently located 2 streets away from the circus of Picadilly lies this gem of a Japanese restaurant, tucked away in a hidden corner.The service is class, and so is the ingredients/quality of food. I stayed away from the Westernized Japanese food (fried stuff and anything that could mask the real taste of raw fresh fish) and dived right into the real deal. The waitress told me the chirashi is the signature dish. Bingo. Always can judge a Japanese restaurant at how good their chirashi dish is. Anyone who knows me well knows I love doing this. Challenge accepted!The sashimi and rice set - absolute beauty and freshness. A must have. I begged them not to waste food and give me half the portion of rice; which not only they followed but even half a portion was still very generous! It was laid out in such a beautiful and tasteful/tasty fashion. Look at the photo to see it for yourself!The fish was of top quality and so was the shrimp. Class and quality all the way. The sushi rice was the PERFECT temperature (lukewarm); and the sushi was served on top of ice - so that the fish would not be half scored from the lukewarm rice. Nicely laid out. A plus for this. The sushi rice was laced with perfectly cut tiny portion of greens sprinkled with roe. Delish!The \"1st picking\" green tea is of exceptional quality and brewed with plentiful tea leaves. The desert menu is simple but do try the green tea tiramisu if it's there.Lastly but not least the ambiance upstairs is contemporary, calm yet simple. Not a lot of seating so do reserve if it's nice sunny weekend.",

Everything was well made and extremely tasty. The value was decent.The service was very courteous and efficient. Although, the place was almost empty (just my partner and me plus two other groups of two people) so the servers certainly weren't strained.They also have a nice range of sake and a handful of lagers.A good place to get a sushi fix.",

    "text": "I've been to Yoshino a few times now but the last time was 2 years ago. I know... quite a long hibernation. Last night I tried the Tsuki set meal with my friend Takeshi and we were both treated with palatable and exciting creations. I really enjoyed the lot especially the tuna carpaccio. The flavour did not overpower the natural taste of thin tuna sashimi topped with herbs that were perfect garnish. Another part of the set is the prawn tempura. \u00a0The sauce gave a good compliment to three battered prawns. The miso soup was added with a prawn's head and the awesome taste reminded me of a particular soup meal that my mum used to make for me back home. The work-of-art award belongs to the carefully and thin cut jumbo California roll. How they managed to put the ingredients together to amazing effect deserves recognition for a set meal that only cost \u00a320 (excluding drinks and service). I paired my entire meal with a good dry Spanish white wine. I'm already thinking about when I can revisit Yoshino Restaurant. I'm sure it will be sooner this time.",

    "text": "Disclaimer: this refers only to the take out counter; I have not been to the restaurant.I used to take out from here when I first moved to London; I was working near their counter/restaurant just off Piccadilly and we made company trips out of it - buying the bulk packs across different flavours in order to have a varied meal. And that worked out well; you certainly got a lot of fish for your money.About 2 years later however and the portions started to be scaled back, but not the price. The morsels of fish you do get started to taste a little strange at times; certainly not the freshest cuts and also rather fatty compared to elsewhere.One of the interesting things with Yoshino is there slightly different take on some sushi pieces - for example their \"Super Fried Chicken\" and Spicy Chicken is essentially katsu chicken pieces with mayo/something in a roll. Which is actually quite nice, despite how it sounds. However it's sad that I need to rely on an a gimmick (or indeed, chicken) for a sushi restaurant to supply something worthwhile at their takeaway counter.",

It had all the ambience of a high end sushi spot, but the sushi I was served was pre-made and basically tasted like something you might get at the grocery store. I had also ordered a hand roll - something that is very common at sushi restaurants, although not listed on the menu here. It tasted fresher than the cut rolls I had ordered, but on my bill there appeared a \u00a36.8 \"open kitchen\" charge, apparently to compensate for the fact that it was made when I ordered it! What a concept!There is a benihana about a block away. I bet those guys would never dare to serve you sushi from a saran-wrapped tray from the fridge....",

The food was delicious (to the second power); the service super-friendly and the atmosphere buzzing but yet calm...When we entered Yoshino during a typical London lunch hour, the only seats available were those at the bar; but in the end this was what made this dining experience ever so memorable to me, as we could watch the sushi chefs doing their magic right in front of us. Once we had made ourselves comfortable, I perused the menu for a while and I could definitely feel my saliva glands working overtime...everything sounded so delicious. In the end, I went for a lunch deal (Yoshino Zen \"Yuki\"), which turned out to be just perfect; \u00a0in fact, for a mere \u00a39.80 I was pleasantly has how generous and diverse the portion was. But more importantly, the quality and the taste of my food was amazing: The chicken katsu was crisp and the accompanying curry sauce complemented it very well. The honyed potatoes tasted great, as did the green beans...not to mention the tuna, the rolls, the miso soup, and the pickles...In short: Yoshino made me very happy!!!",
