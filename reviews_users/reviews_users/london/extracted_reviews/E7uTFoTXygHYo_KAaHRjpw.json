    "text": "Oliveto is a small, very authentic italian restaurant/pizzeria in the middle of the Belgravia area. I ate there a couple of times, and were pleased by the food (which has a Sardinian orientation) and the surprisingly good pizza (thin and tasty crust, good ingredients, perfect cooking). I see other reviewers mention slow service, I wonder if they mean that the food took long to cook (which is good, in my opinion) or the waiters didn't pay attention to them. When I went there the restaurant wasn't particularly crowded and the service was timely, if a little cold, given what I would be expecting from a southern Italian restaurant. Overall, good value for money, no frills restaurant for lovers of good quality, authentic Italian food. Not particularly indicated for people that needs classy/stylish ambiances wherever they eat. 7/10.",

Lady Luck seemed to be on our side the evening that my friends and I visited, as we arrived at Oliveto around 10 p.m. and quickly got a table for five. However, I highly suggest making a reservation for this restaurant (especially on weekends) and will do so the next time I plan to visit. Not so much due to luck as to attentive service and delicious food, we had a wonderful time at this smart Belgravia restaurant.",

Although its menu has stayed almost the same for years, the restaurant offers the perfect selection of authentic starters, combined with pasta or pizza offers for main course. Their pizza al granchio is simply amazing, and luckily they do a take-away service too! It's moderately priced (around \u00a310 for a pizza) but the pizzas are huge and I have never left feeling anything less than stuffed! Good selection of wines, and informal dining atmosphere, the tables can be a little too close but it's not the kind of restaurant you sit and wallow in and they do a brisk trade. I would definitely recommend booking, even on a weeknight as it gets very busy and every time I'm there, they have to turn away people at the door.",

Some attention must be given to this and many solutions are available, if management desires (which it should).",

    "text": "Outstanding! Classic Sardinian cuisine yet young and energetic. We decided to make a meal of appetizers. I had the lentil and carrot soup. It was lovely, but not quite hot enough. I should have sent it back to be heated. My second appetizer was bresaola de tonno. Heaven on earth. Cured and dried tuna, sliced paper thick, draped over perfectly cooked haricots verts and drizzled with a sublime olive oil. Best thing I have put in my mouth in a long time (and I put lots of nice things in my mouth!). Dear hubby started with buffalo mozzarella with a mound of caponata. Buffalo mozzarella can be tricky, but this was perfect. The caponata was the perfect balance of sweet and sour and still very fresh. His second plate was artichoke with tomato and shrimp. He raved about that too. Since we had been good with dinner, having just two appetizers each after all, we decided gloom at the dolci menu. We went for the panna cotta with a raspberry coulis. The panna was black with vanilla beans. The coulis was extremely flavorful and, thank the good lord, not too sweet. Perfection. Service was attentive but not overbearing. Just exactly right. Plan to go again. Will be hard to not have the same things we had tonight, but we absolutely must try some of the native Sardinian pastas. They look just scrumptious.",

One was absolutely empty, a server inside pacing anxiously about, doing her best to restrain herself from running out, grabbing us by the wrists, and pulling us inside as we pursued the very expensive menu.And then there was Oliveto, absolutely packed to the gills, with only one two-top table available at 8pm on Thursday night.Telling? A bit. Needless to say, we chose Oliveto and were not disappointed.Starting with the carrot, potato and rosemary soup, we discovered that they had entire wine sections devoted to Sardinia. And entire food sections devoted to Sardinia. And entire pizza menus devoted to, you guessed it, Sardinia. About half way through our perfectly cooked crab linguine and buffalo mozzarella pizza, we spotted the table to our left devouring cuttlefish with squid ink glaze, and to our right rocking some sea urchin pasta. It only took us a few more painstakingly dense minutes to realise that... hey, this must be a Sardinian restaurant! (I promise, I was the only blond one in the group...) \u00a0I would highly recommend this spot for a easy authentic Italian meal out, a smokin' cheap date (relatively,) or a quick dinner either pre or post show if you're in Victoria. A bit on the pretentious side, but with food this good, I can't blame them!",

    "text": "Mauro Sanna's cache of excellent eateries around the southern end of Belgravia set an amazing standard for food and service - and in the case of Oliveto in particular, price. Approaching the restaurant at the Victoria end of the beautifully repaved and refurbished Elizabeth Street may give one pause as there's usually a collection of expensive cars outside, and it's always packed and as a result is quite noisy and the chairs have a disturbing slope to the seats, but these are quibbles. The service is friendly and professional; Mauro himself is often in evidence and there's little waiting. On a recent Friday night visit we had booked at 9.00 but arrived at 8.15 and were found a table without fuss, and were quickly drinking the excellent Sardinian house white and red wine and tap water, while lapping up the signature ricci di mare (sea urchin) with toast, a treat only available all the year round at the sister restaurant Olivomare. But the true accolades must be reserved for the crab linguini, quite simply the most delicious pasta dish any of us had eaten. There was masses of crab and the linguine was coated so liberally with the rich sauce so that one could hardly get enough of it. One of us had the veal chop, which was also spectacularly good, though possibly just a trifle well-done. And another had the pizza calzone, which was spectacular, arriving at the table looking much like a woman's breast, but was quickly punctured! We ended with panacotta with a fruit sauce, reliably delicious. Three courses - the pudding shared - and a bottle of the sardinian red plus two glasses of the white brought the total with service to \u00a335 a head. Terrific for London, and for that food and in that part of London, astonishing!",

Anything with truffle oil here I highly recommend. The breasolla, pasta and pizza are all to die for. They have a list of specials each night which are always outstanding. Tonight I had the Radicchio con Speck to start (radicchio with pork shoulder), which was delicious, followed by the Pizza Breasolla (pizza with thinly sliced beef, parmesan slices and rocket), which was also outstanding. The table had some delicious white wine, as well. The service was wonderful, the staff attentive, friendly and knowledgable. The menu is also incredibly reasonably priced, with most of the pizzas falling into the \u00a310-\u00a314 range, and the starters ranging from about \u00a37-14. The atmosphere is great, just dark enough and really intimate. My one and only request would be that they give a pizza cutter with each pizza, as the crust is incredibly hard to cut through with a normal knife! This place is a true gem tucked away by Victoria.",

    "text": "For photos and more please refer to hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026 Oliveto is another example of a substandard,overpriced Italian restaurant in London. I don't know why you can find so many of them in London,I think I have eaten more bad Italian food than any other cuisine. Oliveto is part of a small Sardinian restaurant dynasty consisting of a few restaurants with olive inspired names (the others are Olivo,Olivomare and Olivino),all in the Belgravia area. Unfortunately,Oliveto is an example of a previously nice restaurant gone bad. I used to eat there once in a while several years back,and while it never was one of my favourite restaurants,it was appropriate for a decent,no fuss pizza or plate of pasta. I always disliked the restaurant's interior though. Completely devoid of anything (like carpets,wall paper,curtains) to dampen the sound of the diners,the background noise is deafening and you literally have to converse by shouting,even if you sit next to each other. Not the best atmosphere for a relaxed dinner,but good enough for a quick lunch. My first visit after several years was very disappointing. The plate of grigliata mista di verdure (8.70) as antipasto was mediocre and not exactly generous. Particularly as half of it was celeriac and celeriac is my top most hated vegetable. (Mind you,this little detail is NOT Oliveto's fault). My most favourite part of the meal was the bread basket. Fresh ciabatta and crisp pane carasau (the typical Sardinian bread) were surprisingly delicious,considering the rest of the meal. I would have had to go home hungry if not for this,as the pizza clearly missed the mark. Considering that Oliveto is supposed to be a Sardinian restaurant,I have my doubts that there could possibly be an Italian behind this pizza. I think you would call it a crime,no treason,against every proud Italian pizza chef.We chose pizza carretiera (13.40) which was advertised to contain buffalo mozzarella,fresh tomato and basil. The dough was not bad,thin and not too salty. The remainder however was horrible. Everything was swimming in tomato sauce,which tasted like straight out of a packet or tin and was far too liquid. To advertise basil as a pizza topping and then only add four measly leaves is a bit mean. However,to sprinkle everything with a weird green artificial tasting basil sauce is an abomination and can't be forgiven. The biggest problem was the 'fresh tomato'part. Apart from the fact that the tomatoes were tasteless,the useless pizza chef had put the pieces of buffalo mozarealla (I am not even sure it was buffalo to be honest) only exactly on top of the tomatoes. In case you were wondering this doesn't work,as it makes the cheese hard and stringy,you almost couldn't chew it. The atmosphere,as mentioned before,is more remeniscent of a busy train station (noise-wise I mean) and the service personnel is brusque. People don't seem to mind though,as it was absolutely packed when I went to Oliveto. I think I have just answered my own question,the reason why there are so many substandard,overpriced Italian restaurant in London is that people indiscriminately go there.",

    "text": "Like a number of other reviewers, i have mixed feelings about this place. I had to take a night bus from Victoria coach station and wanted to have Italian food. Based on the prices and the yelp reviews, i chose Oliveto.As my friends and i went in on a friday evening, we found that the restaurant was packed to the brim ... always a good sign.But the downside of the popularity was visible soon enough. We called and gestured ... but no one came to take our order. Two of us (out of the six) were 45 minutes late. We feared that we would finish by the time they arrived. But we had barely received the food on the table by then.I had ordered the traditional sardinian spaghetti with grey mullet roe. I haven't had fish pasta many times before and this one tasted very good (i will try some version of this again). But the taste was brought about by an excess of oil and butter (like what you see in cheap Indian restaurants). So much so that when i finished there was a measurable pool of oil left on the plate.My friends ordered pizza ... a variety of them, and all of them were considerably better than my pasta. One of them had the calzone, which was tasty and had a lot of good mozzarella and ricotta \u00a0in it (in fact my spaghetti was the only dish that was less than filling). Someone ordered plain cheese and tomato while someone else ordered a mushroom pizza. The mushrooms were very good. That guy didn't like them so i borrowed a substantial chunk from him :)While we were there waiting and then eating, the crowd had thinned considerably. However the pace (or lack of it) of the service did not change at all. So i assume its a systemic problem that they have.One thing i noticed was that the manager seemed to know many of the arriving patrons. So this restaurant has quite a few regulars, and i could see the reason why. The food was delicious ... and at \u00a314 per head, not too expensive either.If you want a cheap Italian meal in that part of the city, go for Oliveto. But if you have a bus to board in half an hour then this surely isn't the place for you.",

My friend has been to this place several times and I have a gut feeling that this restaurant holds a special sentiment in his heart. I'm glad he shared this place with me so now I can share this with all yelpers. The first thing I want to stress is to book ahead of time. Even on a Wednesday even, this place is packed. If we had not walked in at 7 (when it opened) I'm sure we would have to wait for table. You can tell why it's so popular: the food (albeit on the pricier side) is really good. What we ordered:-Polpo Con Rucola: Octopus dressed with oil, vinegar and garlic-Speghetti Ai Ricci Di Mare: Spaghetti with sea urchins, garlic and a touch of chili-Tagliatelle Al Cozze (special): Fresh tagliatelle with cream of mascarpone cheese, shallots and muscles. -Tiramisu: Sponge fingers soaked in coffee with marscarpone cream and cocoa-Gelato allo yoghurt: Sardinian bitter honey frozen yoghurtFrom the appetizer to the desserts, it was all amazing. Nothing was amiss, although in hindsight, I wish I ordered a pizza as well. You can tell the people there are passionate about their job and know what they're doing. The highlight of the evening was when our waitress forgot my glass of wine until we were nearly finished. She apologised and asked if I still wanted it. When we decided it was too late for a glass as we were nearly finish and would rather go to a pub afterwards, she was very understanding and took it off our bill.",

'Spaghetti with mullet roe' could never be missed here!!! Once you had it, it would definitely become your addiction. Also 'Raw beef slices' never be missed. Parmesan shavings and truffle oil go really well with them. Good harmony Rich and flavourful! 'Crab meat pasta' was served a lot and looked nice when we first came. So tried it this time. It turned out it's really amazing full of garlic taste.Most of all are simple menu but never disappoint me. The prices are nice as well.(2 pasta, raw beef,red endive salada and two drinks cost 80\u00a3 in total. ) I'd definitely come back soon ;)",

I've had a lot of calamari during my foodie lifetime & this was done so well. The squid was breaded perfectly & was a top a salad with sweet balsamic dressing that pulled the whole appetizer together. Don't expect a whole platter of calamari. We were happy with the amount we got plus you don't want to fill up on the appetizer. ;) I ordered the Tagliatelle Al Prosciutto for my main course, which included cream of Mascarpone cheese & shallots. It was love at first sight when I saw the pasta was wrapped in the prosciutto! It was creamy & the perfect amount of saltiness. I drizzled some of their spicy olive oil on top & it took it to the next level. My husband ordered the Linguine Al Granchio, which was pasta with crab meat. Both dishes were simple, but perfect. For dessert we ordered the Coffee Gelati that came in a gorgeous glass cup. Ice cream & gelato should always be presented this way!If only we discovered this place sooner during our trip, we would've definitely come back. Service was very welcoming & attentive. I think the servers could tell we loved the food because we cleaned the plates. No shame, lol. The dishes were simple, but didn't lack in flavor. Thank you Oliveto for satisfying our Italian food cravings on a late Friday night!",

Located in either the city of Westminster or Chelsea, this quaint but beautiful neighborhood draws its customers from a lively, but almost regal-like crowd.The food at Oliveto was astounding. Beginning with their Mozzarella, I was delighted to say that it was juicy, cold and amazing. The freshness of the mozzarella is always a good way to test the authenticity of an Italian restaurant. My entree consisted of their Pizza 4 Stagioni. Italian-styled pizza is my favorite and this pizza only confirmed that. Nice thin crust, not burnt, but just right. Covered with Sardinian ham, sausages, and more mozzarella (yes, I cannot get enough of it), this pizza was cooked masterfully and my taste buds were thoroughly rewarded.The staff here are very amicable and are responsive to your needs. Not only that, but they actually refill your tap water glasses pretty consistently, which is a rarity among European restaurants in general. Definitely a gem of an Italian restaurant.~Carpe Diem~",

We had a reservation and reading the reviews and comparing it to my experience this place doesn't seem to have the ambiance of a restaurant that is difficult to get a table. Granted the prices here want to indicate that this is a top notch restaurant but the service and food was average and the ambiance was just that of your very average restaurant. That said, if this place is as demanding as all make it to seem, then kudos to the staff for not making us feel rushed.When sitting down you get a type of fried pancake with rosemary sprinkled.I ordered the pasta with pork sausage, which was nice but nothing to draw me back with the desire to try more things off their menu. \u00a0For dessert we all shared a tiramisu, whixh was actually pretty good.",

    "text": "The food here is quite tasty and affordable. It is at an even better value if you get the pizza which is more than enough to feed one mouth, even two and okay, three if you have some kids or everyone is on a diet! I believe they're known for their pizzas but i couldn't resist getting the sea urchin pasta - it sounded so fancy! The portion however was very tiny and it tasted primarily like olive oil, so not the most satisfying. And it wasn't a plentiful of sea urchin meat (see uploaded photo for reference) but then again I've never had a sea urchin pasta before so maybe it's suppose to be dainty servings. I think this was also the first Italian restaurant that didn't serve complimentary bread or salad so i was quite hungry at the start and also at the end of the main course. My friends who ordered pizza seemed quite full though. :-) So, I decided to order desert too. I had the chocolate and almond cake which came with a scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream. The ice cream is also its own desert item but it's around the same price, which is why i ordered the cake that came with the bonus ice cream as a side! Cake was a bit bitter and dry though but it was still tasty dark chocolate flavor . It had almond pieces but no almond taste so I think the almonds were really just for the texture. The service was great because I showed up prematurely to the restaurant thinking my friend made reservations. The owner checked their reservation list and called another its branch restaurant to find my party's name. When my friends finally arrived, they said they didn't call in advance - oopsies! However they gladly seated us to an open table and told us that the next party will need the table an hour and a half from now. We were delighted to not have to wait! Overall a good value restaurant and friendly for a kids, a candle light dinner or just catching up with friends.",

Loved the infused olive oils for the bread and even to sprinkle on your pasta. I had a special of the day linguini in garlic with clams YUM!!!! The hazelnut & pistachio gelato for dessert was perfect! Great wine, great service, fantastic food!!!!",
