I had the service entrance on my left and the entrance to the room at my back. I asked for a Martinez as an aperetif. Blank look. Sweet gin martini? Made with something like old tom? Nothing. Ok a regular martini with tanqueray 10. Don't have 10. At thus point am underwhelmed. Why offer an aperetif if you don't have gin? I went for hendricks in the end. It was good. Then I decided to stop being an arse. After some amuse bouche of fishy green paste and chickpea chips I had the chilled mint pea soup (lovely stock, possibly veal) razor clam, monkfish and then lamb. The portions here are tiny so that was ok. The cheese tray was pretty. The staff expert. But that feeling of eating something lovely and amazing was absent. It was competent cooking. But not clever. Or suprising. It didn't explode in the mouth like some of the offerings at 32 great queen st. So it gets three stars. Don't go there. Go to 32 great queen street instead. Or steak at cafe boheme. This place hasn't got it's act in gear yet and I'm not sure it shall.",

We went for the toptable 241 deal (\u00a368 per person usually)on the tasting menu and it blew my mind. The service was the perfect level of unobtrusive but attentive and I think has wrecked me for any other restaurant that I go to. The freshly baked in house raisin bread was nearly my downfall as I couldn't stop eating it almost to the detriment of the rest of the menu. Try to resist the bread, maybe you have more will power than me! I adored pretty much everything but stand outs for me were strangely the sorbets, which I substituted for the cheese course, which were refreshing and zingy and exactly waht I wanted at that point in quite a rich meal. Better in fact than the pre dessert which was a mini chocolate fondant and cherries. It was ok but I resented the space I had wasted on it afterwards when the actual dessert arrived which was the amazing (yes! that word again) signature dark chocolate and praline dessert. If Alexis Gauthier won't take this the wrong way it tasted like a very very posh Ferrero Rocher, which in my book is a compliment!So why not the elusive 5 stars? Well I don't want to lose my hard to please badge for one and I'm saving it in case something even more mind blowing comes along but frankly on this showing I think that's unlikely.",

The main course of guinea fowl was a highlight \u00a0meltingly soft and full of flavour, and I have to rave about the famous Louis XV dessert. For a chocoholic like me, it may just have been the holy grail of desserts! Just the right balance of sweet and crunchy croquante base, bitter chocolate mousse with a velvety rich chocolate coating \u00a0heaven! The service was as you'd expect of this level of restaurant \u00a0friendly, unobtrusive and efficient. The setting is so cosy \u00a0small rooms in a Georgian townhouse and with fireplaces roaring, a really lovely experience on a snowy winter's night, and quite different to other restaurants in the same league. We'd have stayed longer but had a show to get to. Next time, we're planning on nowhere to go afterwards, so we can linger and enjoy the experience for as long as possible! Can't recommend highly enough.",

    "text": "Even though I gave it two stars, I hate this place with a passion of a thousand suns. \u00a0Opentable thinks it's in the top 3 of London restaurants, so we were really excited to try this supposed hot-spot. \u00a0And it was, they were really busy, especially at our 10 o'clock reservation time. \u00a0We arrived, as I always do, on time, and were ready to get seated and eating.Nope. \u00a0We were invited to wait in the wine cellar with a glass of wine, and they led us to a maybe 6 ft x 4 ft room surrounded by wine. \u00a0Not so much a cellar but a prison cell. \u00a0There was a small table with some empty wine glasses and olive pits. \u00a0I think at one point ages ago someone did enjoy some wine here, but it wasn't us, and it wasn't going to be us. \u00a0We sat here waiting 20 minutes as my temper simmered. \u00a0Soon after, a well-off older gentleman and his party came in, and were also directed to the wine prison cell with no wine being served. \u00a0After only a few minutes, he rightfully complained (he also had a reservation), and was sent some complimentary champagne. \u00a0Um, hello?!? \u00a0No one offered me any, so I was that guy, and asked...no, demanded it. \u00a0We were given glasses, but it did nothing to quell my anger. \u00a045 minutes after our reservation, we were finally seated. \u00a0Only to be literally ignored for another half hour. \u00a0You'd think I was kidding, as I know it sounds like I'm exaggerating, but all of this can be collaborated. \u00a0We asked numerous people for a menu, but they said \"I can't do it, I'm not the waiter, I'll get your waiter.\" \u00a0Finally, about 1.5 hours after we arrived, we were given our menus. \u00a0I won't go more into detail about how terrible the service was, but we managed to stay for 4 courses, skipping dessert. \u00a0The food was actually decent - I remember a foie gras course being good, but there were more off-putting memories. \u00a0*English skills were really lacking here - almost no one spoke English well. \u00a0Here! \u00a0In London! \u00a0In England!*It was clear that employees had been trained to do their job, and only that. \u00a0Therefore, if it was one person's job to clear plates, that's all he did. \u00a0Even if he wanted to help you with something, he couldn't.*We got stiffed on food. \u00a0It was late, and they were probably running out - but I clearly saw 3 scallops on another diner's plate, whereas my dish only had 2. \u00a0Yes, I noticed, I just didn't know what to do.*This place smelled. \u00a0Bad. \u00a0We may have been right next to the kitchen, or a ton of smelly cheese (we were), but the whole place smelled off-putting. \u00a0My sister thought it smelled like a bathroom or someone's BO.The only redeeming quality about this place was the guy in charge of pouring water. \u00a0He was incredible. \u00a0This was his only job, and he did it so freakin' well. \u00a0My water glass never hit the halfway mark, and he was sneaky fast at getting out of the way. \u00a0I think he knew service was going terribly - at one point, we made eye contact and he kind of gave me a look that said \"yeah, I know it's bad, I can see your plates sitting here for a long time, but I'm not allowed to help you clean it up\".You couldn't pay me to go back there and eat.",

    "text": "While in London, recently, we went to this very upscale French restaurant in Soho. Everything was amazing!!!The wait staff and sommelier were perfectly attentive, without being cloying, intrusive, or pompous. We ordered the tasting menu with the wine pairing. Unfortunately, the meal was three weeks ago, so i don't recall specific dishes, but each dish was delicious, with an excellent array of fish, beef and lamb. The portions were perfect to experience the flavors without becoming engorged after the multiple courses. The appointments were lovely. The building was lovely, with multiple floors and rooms, enforcing a romantic and intimate atmosphere.As a side note, we were seated next to a very proper looking pair of ladies. Eventually, I noticed the woman sitting next to me was a tranny. As an American in London, it often seems that upscale establishments can be a little, uh , prim. So, it was cool to have a little funk element in all the elegance.The only downside was the the freakin' pound. Hahahahahaaha!After the exchange rate, the meal was around $500 USD for two. Nevertheless, it was an exquisite experience.",

    "text": "I'm in a tiny room; I looked around at the floor to ceiling stacks of alcohol around me. Yes, my table for dinner at Gauthier is in the wine room. This is what I get for only making reservations the day before I guess? I'm here to have a farewell dinner with one of my friends who finished her 3 months secondment in London and moving onto New York before finally returning to Sydney. It was while searching for a place to eat that I discovered that Gauthier currently have a 2 for 1 offer on their tasting menu. With an offer like this, no hesitation from the dinner party. So back to the wine room, it was both cool and weird at the same time. Weird as we have the wait staff coming in regularly to pick up bottles of wine and we can hear the clinking of cutleries and dishes sent out from the kitchen. We started with a tray of canap\u00e9s. The beetroot macaron was a mini flavour burst followed by cr\u00e8me fraiche wrapped in smoked salmon which was unmemorable. Sticks of Parmesan Crostinis was dipped into a narrow glass holding a confit of onions and mustard. I couldn't get enough of this; those sticks vanished quickly trying to mop up all that confit. Foie Gras RoyaleThis got mixed results with the dinner party. I actually like it. You get the taste of the foie gras without it being overpowering. The broad beans cuts through the heaviness with the cherry and port granite adding sweetness. It could do with a bit more of the cherry and port granite though. Scallop, parsley jusThe scallop was cooked perfectly and was great by itself. The accompaniments don't enhance and in fact mutes the fresh and sweet taste of the scallop. Summer Truffle RisottoI tend to steer away from risottos as this tends to be cooked badly in a lot of places. Am happy to say that the risotto here is really good. It might be a touch too al dente but I don't mind and in fact like that it gives a bit more texture. The truffles perfumes the air around you, this is one amazing risotto. Wild Sea bass & Tiny SquidIt took nearly 30 minutes before our next course, the sea bass arrives. In fact, I was wondering when looking at it what the 30 minutes was for and after tasting it, the same thought still rings in my head. Crispy & Soft PigletWafer thin crackling that is light and crunchy, that was what I remembered most about the piglet course. Selection of Unpasteurized French CheesesIt is unusual when dessert takes up 3 courses of a tasting menu. We started of with three cheeses. Each were quite mild with the boldest being the blue cheese. Nothing too exciting. Mini Chocolate fondant, Warm Soft CherryWhite Peach Souffle, Champagne SorbetI wasn't excited with any of the desserts. They were all good but not spectacular. Gauthier does good solid French food and I would still recommend it. The risotto is really amazing but everything else I probably wouldn't miss too much. It is incredible value with their current offer for the month of August only. Do jump and book it before it is over.",

    "text": "I was invited to the soft launch of the restaurant a couple of weeks back. The start wasn't too auspicious as our names weren't down despite me phoning to check our reservation earlier that day. However, the food surpassed all expectation and put paid to any minor gripes. Loved the option of a tasting menu \u00a370 or smaller 'plats' 3 \u00a327/ 4 \u00a335 / 5 \u00a336. Eyes bigger than bellies as usual we ordered the full 5 and were stuffed after 3. ummmm.. And everything we had was absolutely delicious, the service spot-on (as you'd expect); it was somewhat lacking in atmosphere, but not enough to drop a star! The herb & ricotta ravioli were little parcels of loveliness; the wild garlic risotto dense, cheesy and filling; the sweetbreads richer than Donald Trump and the marrow that came with the angus beef was sublimely unctuous. Is it that wrong to love eating FAT?? Yes, probably, and i don't think my heart nor my thighs will thank me, but sod 'em! I had the mille-fueille for dessert, which was silly because that's what i have all the time and i had complete plate envy for Ollie's souffle! All the more reason to go back!!!!! As if i ever needed one. There's also a perfectly reasonable lunch menu (2 courses \u00a318; 3 courses \u00a325) with the best bits of the dinner menu to choose from. I don't think there's agoing to be too much of a wait for that coveted michelin star!! Oh, and just one thing, I cannot believe I've been so remiss as to leave off the bread. I don't actually think I've ever reviewed the bread in a restaurant before. It's not something I generally even notice. But BOY, grab as many as you can and smuggle them home, and then grab more and smuggle them to me. The bacon and onion roll is like biting into the BEST bacon sandwich EVER after garnering the WORST hangover ever. The wild garlic roll is what Pizza Express dough balls aspire to be. Serious Hollywood A list stuff going on here!!!! Anyway, my gushing enthusiasm is just getting embarrassing. Go.",

    "text": "It's not often that you find yourself at a restaurant that appears to be run by a food fetishist. In the same way that someone might caress and inhale the leather of a shoe before begging for the sharpness of the heel to give the sensation that it shall puncture the skin Alexis Gauthier does this very same thing with his cuisine. Gauthier cooks by using instinct as demonstrated on BBC's Masterchef a few weeks ago. He has a good grope, sniff (and possibly a sly lick) of his ingredients before making them work together in harmony. He has quite an extensive style of bringing out the intensities of individual ingredients and has a way with vegetables like no other. My Beloved and I had a rather memorable date to remember last night. There is something slightly kinky about Gauthier. You have to ring a doorbell before they let you in and then you are led up some stairs (in my case) to the table. The dining room when I first entered was quiet, with exception to two other people talking in hushed tones. There were a lot of waiting staff and although there was a sense of formality it wasn't so stuffy that you found yourself wanting to say 'excuse me' every time you were to do something like breath or take a sip of water. First thing I have to give good points to, is the fact that they serve filtered still or sparkling water for free. The snacks offered were an interesting array of beetroot mousse, smoked salmon mousse with caviar on top, peanut bread sticks with guacamole and some garlic crisps that were served in a martini glass with flavoured salt. To look at it was visually appealing as well as everything having little explosions of flavour. The bread too was phenomenal, and I would recommend the chorizo bread regardless of whether or not you have vegetarian inclinations. Just think of it as veggie chorizo and you will be transported to the tree in eden in no time. Our amuse bouche was some poached halibut which was delicatein flavour and was almost like eating a kiss. For my starter I had some crab which sat on a clam jelly and had a light cream sace which was striped ever so neatly on the plate. All the elements together were the work of a true alchemist. In the jelly there was definitely an echo of lime in there as this gave a wonderful citrusy note to the rest of the dish and cut through the richness of the crab. It was a very well balanced dish in terms of the flavours. My beloved ordered Tortelini, which had lobster inside and was served with squid in an asian inspired broth. It was described as a 'Lobster and Lemongrass Consomm\u00e8' yet it had a depth of flavour that definitely swept you to the Orient. It was clean, light and perfectly formed. A bit like her. Unlike my dish which was a calculated transformationwhich is a bit like me. To continue I had some Wild Sea Bass which sat on some white asparagus and was cooked with cep mushrooms and garlic. It was heaven. Skin perfectly crisp, every other element was identifiable and just built up flavour layers in my mouth. Gauthier was in full throttle now. His flavours were working overtime in my mouth, I felt I had been groomed into having a delicate massage and now I was starting to get gently punched in the back in rhythm with all of the flavour bursts happening in my mouth. For my companion, she ordered the Halibut which was a bit of a wild card but a wonderfully tasting one It was cooked confit style with lime and kumquat. This was served with a spring onion and pea volut\u00e8. It melted and zinged in the mouth in a way an expensive date should do. You wanted more yet you knew you had to eat daintily and take your time to appreciate every flavour in place here. To follow I had the guinea fowl which came with what I feel was too many mushrooms and I have to say I think the portion size was too big. But I rather a generous chef than a stingey one. It was very rich and unctuous and all the elements worked. The mushroom with asparagus and pomme mousseline \u00a0but there was quite a lot of it. The meat was beautiful and rich and very well cooked. It is worth eating if you are starving and want a serious meat fix. My Beloved ordered lamb which I was amazed by. Perfectly pink it was served with aubergine and red pepper and a delicate sauce. I never knew thyme could work so well with lamb but Gauthier has pulled it off. For pre dessert we were given some rhubarb with ginger which was truly sensational and was the perfect palate cleanser. I didn't want a dessert as I felt too full but I 'helped' my partner try the signature dessert which was the Golden Louis XV and next time I am going to have that and maybe half of someone else's as this was a chocolate disk of joy. It had melty and complex textures and flavours provided by the hazelnuts inside but the very dark smooth chocolate all blended together in harmony. I adored it. The Petit Fours were imaginative. There was a black truffle truffle but for me the star of",

A number of the staples made their way across -- the reliable (and delicious!) risottos and the breads. Only minuses were: haphazard service (although the ma\u00eetre d', and Roberto, are always solid), cold decor, lack of music/warmth in the dining rooms. Everything else is a plus: the two cosy dining rooms, the subversive/campy restroom prints, the charming off license, the transparency on wine pricing (and such reasonable prices!), the food, and of course the wine list. Roberto, who has so much personality, imbued the extensive and reasonably-priced wine list with his own personal touch. For cheese lovers, the wine and cheese pairing is highly recommended. We did notice that the menu recently got re-priced upwards -- but for the quality of the cuisine, the prices still offer a great deal.",

It could do with a bit more of the cherry and port granite though.Scallop, parsley jusThe scallop was cooked perfectly and was great by itself. The accompaniments don't enhance and in fact mutes the fresh and sweet taste of the scallop.Summer Truffle RisottoI tend to steer away from risottos as this tends to be cooked badly in a lot of places. Am happy to say that the risotto here is really good. It might be a touch too al dente but I don't mind and in fact like that it gives a bit more texture. The truffles perfumes the air around you, this is one amazing risotto.Wild Sea bass & Tiny SquidIt took nearly 30 minutes before our next course, the sea bass arrives. In fact, I was wondering when looking at it what the 30 minutes was for and after tasting it, the same thought still rings in my head.Crispy & Soft PigletWafer thin crackling that is light and crunchy, that was what I remembered most about the piglet course.Selection of Unpasteurized French CheesesIt is unusual when dessert takes up 3 courses of a tasting menu. We started of with three cheeses. Each were quite mild with the boldest being the blue cheese. Nothing too exciting.Mini Chocolate fondant, Warm Soft CherryWhite Peach Souffle, Champagne SorbetI wasn't excited with any of the desserts. They were all good but not spectacular.Gauthier does good solid French food and I would still recommend it. The risotto is really amazing but everything else I probably wouldn't miss too much. It is incredible value with their current offer for the month of August only. Do jump and book it before it is over.",

    "text": "for rating, photos and more:hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026  Gauthier Soho is the restaurant where I went to celebrate in style the happy occasion of me having finally finished my PhD. At the same time, Gauthier Soho probably celebrated that it just got awarded its first Michelin star. Not that it is the owner's first \u00a0Alexis Gauthier has already achieved this award as chef at his former work place Rousillon. But I think, basically, Alexis and me were both happy! I did like the style and atmosphere of the restaurant a lot. You have to ring to be let into the inconspicuous townhouse in the middle of Soho. Instead of being welcomed by posh and polished want to be models which you tend to encounter more and more at top end dining etablissements(see this hilarious review about the waiting staff at Nobu), our coats were taken by a warm and friendly middle-aged man.We were then led into one of the dining rooms on the second floor and due to the diners being spread out between several dining rooms on separate levels, it felt intimate, generous and cosy. I am not sure if this was chance or misogyny, but I did not see a single female employee. The waiters were adorably young (they looked about 12) and French and even though they seemed slightly stiff, I thought they were doing a rather good job in keeping us happy. Particularly the wine waiter was excellent, he knew to not overfill the wine glasses. We decided on the tasting menu for 68 pounds (special occasion, see :) ). Even though 68 pounds is not exactly cheap, it is not a bad price for a tasting menu at a Michelin starred place, particularly considering the high quality of the food served. I thought the strongest part of the meal were the starters. They just about managed to keep the momentum going to through the mains and for me, the desserts were the weakest part of the meal. But this could have been just due to the fact that in the end I just couldn't eat anymore and was therefore not fully able to appreciate the last couple of dishes. The Honey Duck Foie Gras with fresh apple and a port and Parmesan reduction was very good. The liver perfectly cooked worked extremely well with the sweet, almost honey-like sauce and the tangy apple. A promising start to the meal. Next came the Shetland Langoustine and Scallop. I can honestly say that I can't remember ever having had a scallop as fantastic as this one. (Yes, shame, it was only one). Almost raw, it had nothing of the rubbery texture I often associate with scallops, but was literally melting in my mouth. Somehow even the celery was nice even though I usually detest celery.Please give me this Black Winter Truffle Risotto every day! The rice grains were exactly al dente, and the risotto was moist and creamy. The spot-on but subtly seasoning did not overpower but underline the unique taste coming from the generous, fresh shaving of the black truffle. Exquisite! Sigh We then moved on to the mains which admittedly did not blow me away. I am not saying that they were not good but they missed the touch of genius that glimmered through in the starters. The Slowly cooked fillet of halibut was slightly overcooked for my taste and therefore a bit dry. I quite liked the spinach immersed with little clams. Tournedos of Angus Beef was the second main. A dish of solid quality, the meat wonderfully rare, the pancetta and beef jus rich and tasty but again the wow factor was lacking. (I have to say that I am rarely wowed by root vegetables, but then again that is just me). Then I ate far too much of the French cheese. But look at this, could you have resisted? I asked the little waiter to give me a selection of his favourite cheeses. He did, and very generously so. If I could just remember the names, they were all so good! So, i don't like desserts made of citrus fruits, therefore the Glazed Orange Tartlets didn't do it for me. My dinner companion however who is very much into citrus fruity desserts enjoyed it very much, so you might want to believe him in this case. Apparently the Golden Luis XV \u00a0a chocolate praline thing with a gold leaf on top \u00a0is Gauthier's much adored signature dessert. I was not terribly impressed by it actually, I thought it tasted a bit boring. Possibly this estimation was due to the fact that I had about 80 courses before and were close to exploding. So go try it and tell me what you think, ok? When we finally rolled home we had spent close to three hours at Gauthier Soho and I enjoyed every minute of it. Most importantly, there was enough time between the courses not to feel rushed. Feeling rushed at a tasting menu can destroy the whole experience so I think they did an excellent job there. This is the perfect place for a romantic date and I am already desperately waiting for my next big occasion.",

    "text": "[Non-photo Review] For full review, please go to: wp.me/pwXBH-Kf \u00a0Gauthier Soho \u00a0Alexis Goes to Town Summary:Alexis Gauthier, the 1 Michelin star French chef, has moved from Roussillon in Pimlico to a townhouse in the heart of Soho. From a preview meal I had during the restaurant's soft opening, it appears that he may have found a winning formula. The menu format is clever and good value, the environs are cosy and inviting. And the food continues to be precisely cooked with subtle and delicate flavors, while at the same time carrying the chef's particular flair. Gauthier Soho looks set to become a welcome addition to the growing cadre of enjoyable restaurants that have graced Soho over the last couple of years. Trading places There was a rumor circulating earlier this year that French chef Alexis Gauthier, then chef and proprietor of Roussillon, a 1 Michelin star restaurant in London's Pimlico, was looking to do something different. Having broken ground by creating one of the capital's first purely vegetarian tasting menus \u00a0that actually held interest and tasted great throughout \u00a0and then keeping standards consistently high for a number of years, possibly he felt it was time for a new challenge, to take the road less travelled. Having had the pleasure of dining at Roussillon on a few occasions, I was generally impressed \u00a0everything from the service, to the subtly prepared food, through to the elegant little dining room demonstrated that Gauthier wanted his customers to come away having had a wonderful overall experience. And I think most people did. It turns out the rumors were true, and although Gauthier still retains a small shareholding in Roussillon, he has now taken over the townhouse at 21 Romilly Street in Soho, which was home to Irish chef Richard Corrigan's Lindsay House before he moved on himself to open Corrigan's Mayfair. I was lucky enough to dine at the new restaurant, which is matter-of-factly called Gauthier Soho, this week during the 'soft opening', and it opens for business on Monday the 17th of May. As such, the meal was complimentary and diners were asked to leave any token amount of money they felt like leaving as well as filling out detailed comment cards. Making a house a home I was dining with a foodie friend, and we both arrived promptly for our early dinner. The ebony and ivory facade looked subtle and classy, and we were glad to see that the design of the interior rooms had also been well thought out, especially given the constraints that an old townhouse could potentially create for a restaurant attempting to inhabit it. The four-story townhouse that the restaurant occupies is made up of a ground floor dining room with about 18 covers, a first floor dining room with approximately 24 covers, a third floor with two private rooms (one caters for up to 16, the other for up to six), and a fourth floor which houses the administrative offices. The kitchen resides in the basement and there is a temperature-controlled open wine cellar just behind the ground floor dining room (more on that later). The downstairs dining room is pleasantly formal and has a calming effect. In fact, you'd barely know you were in bustling Soho as inside the cool colors and soft lighting put you at ease straight away. There are lovely original features such as the fireplace and also beautiful arrangements of fresh flowers. We felt as if we were sitting in someone's very posh residential dining room, so although it was formal, it was not at all too stiff. The tables themselves are well spaced, allowing for private conversation, and nearly all of the two-person tables were arranged in the 10 o'clock / 2 o'clock format (which I much prefer), with only two tables having chairs positioned directly facing each other. The other thing I liked about the dining room was that there was no music. This is a pet peeve as I usually find the background music in restaurants either pointless or just plain grating. The tables themselves also had some nice modern details, with a red rose bathing in a spherical bowl and a cone-shaped translucent glass lantern. A delicate & subtle hand The menus were delivered and well explained to us. On the main menu, diners have the choice of three, four or five courses, and each course has four different options (with a few more possibilities thrown in at dessert time). These are priced at \u00a327, \u00a336 and \u00a345 respectively and all include an amuse bouche, a pre-dessert and bottomless purified still and sparkling water. One interesting feature is that you can mix and match any of the dishes to form your desired three, four or five course meal (i.e. you could have two of the first plates, one of the third and a cheese plate while other members of your party could do something completely different). There is also a 12-course tasting menu priced at \u00a370, which is also available in pure vegetarian format. Gauthier has always been a big proponent of utilizing the best British produce that is in",

In addition, I ordered the wine pairings and that was also brilliant. \u00a0Each wine built on its predecessor and many were very unique (I just ordered three bottles of a fantastic red where I had never even heard of the grape before).First dish was Scottish lobster with lobster tortellini, and the sauce was so good I almost licked the plate. \u00a0Then we had the dish I was least excited about, poached egg with smoked eel and smoked eel consomm\u00e9. It turned out great and that's when I knew the evening would be fantastic. \u00a0The eel tasted like a brilliant smoked fish and the consistency was not at all chewy.Next came boursin cheese with several accompaniments that worked perfectly.The final started was a black truffle risotto, a signature dish and worth the hype. \u00a0Very strong truffle flavor that melded brilliantly with the risotto.The first main was halibut, simply cooked but tasted great.The main main was venison with a truffle puree. \u00a0Venison was cooked medium rare and the puree oozed truffles, worked very well together.For dessert, started with an apple and quince crumble with caramelized creme, which was brilliantFinished with a chocolate grenache that was great and had a fantastic texture.Service was excellent and I loved the house. \u00a0Like a country house in the middle of Soho. \u00a0As I said, one of my best dining experiences in London (or anywhere).",

    "text": "It was yet another cold and gray day. I tucked myself into Guathier Soho, itself tucked into a side street of a side street in central London. The drizzle of both rain and people stopped at the heavy black door, opening into its dimly lit interior. Candles. A rose. Pale walls. Voices murmuring. If I didn't listen too closely - I could pretend they were flirting in French.I've been watching a lot of Chef's Table recently and one motif that I've found across the episodes has been the idea that chefs want \"to challenge people - make them slightly uncomfortable.\" In fact - Dominique Crenn goes so far as to say \"I struggled with guests who weren't open.\"A meat grinder was forcibly strapped onto our table. The central element of the dish was tossed in and mutilated in front of us to prove that it was fresh. It was then poured over a \"chutney of plum\" bed, topped to give it a strong spice, and finally gorged with crackers. This was called the \"carrot tartare.\" The unique 'tartare' made with nothing more than just the carrots, coriander, shallot, and avocado packed a pop and a pizazz that told me that the pale walls would not come with pale food. My friend and I were taking turns offering up stories of our pasts. Chapters of high schools, first dates, and small towns were interleaved with the chef's plot of aged balsamic reduction, chickpea crust grated lemongrass ice, and wasabi on quinoa bread. 3 candle re-lightings, a mental drive through the suburbs of Georgia, and 8 full courses later - the procession came to an end not less than a full 4 hours after it had begun.Overall, I enjoyed the tasting menu. The carrot tartare was the kind of challenge I expected a one Michelin Star restaurant to attempt. There were dishes that were easily meant just for indulgence too, like the risotto: heavy and drenched in truffle oil. Or the chocolate mousse with a thin sheet of gold. But like the carrot tartare, many were meant to make us fully aware of the present in the restaurant and on our palettes.By the end of the night, the murmuring voices had all but disappeared. The drizzle outside had come to an end. And my first experience at Gauthier Soho was quite a success.",

No fancy art or anything but all very sophisticatedService - 5/5 - Excellent attentive service (though sometimes a bit hard to understand what some of the food is when they describe it because of thick accents)Food - 5/5 - I'm a pescatarian and they were more than happy to swap meat dishes for tfish or veggie dishes in the tasting menu. They also do a veggie tasting menu which looks pretty good. Everything was beautifully presented and tasted great. Hard to pick favourite dishes as they were all excellent but standouts were the lobster, scallop, truffle risotto and parmesan gnocchi (especially the last one - melt in the mouth deliciousness).The only thing I didn't like is that they list the calories on the online menu - I do not really want to know that i'm consuming my daily allowance in one meal!

I called immediately and was told the reason was they were unable to confirm and the phone number left on the reservation was incorrect. Knowing that to be untrue I pressed for a factual explanation and asked them to explain how our table mysteriously disappeared. A different (more senior?) staff member picked up the phone and said the same thing. I told him there were no missed calls on my mobile phone from the restaurant (or anywhere in Europe in fact) and asked him to confirm the number they supposedly called. Not surprisingly they were unable to recite it to me. No apology given, just the same party line about the table being gone and unable to accommodate.

The cosy setting put a smile on my face as soon as we walked into the pretty townhouse, and were ushered through the first door on the right to find two beautifully laid tables and a roaring fireplace just for the 16 of us :)The food was deliciously tasty though beware the portion size isn't very generous. The Christmas group menu had afforded us 3 choices per course which we'd had to pre-order and I was smugly happy with what I went for. Scallops teamed interestingly with pear to start and a roasted guinea fowl main, followed by a cheese course (auto extra star - I'm a sucker for a good cheese plate) and traditional xmas pud (which it seems nobody in the entire world seems to like anymore except for me!).The main selling point though was the service and the little touches. Our waiters were extremely attentive in refilling wine, water and bread, and moved around unobtrusively in what was a fairly cosy space. I loved that we had personalised menus to mark our places printed with the courses we'd chosen, so the staff knew exactly which course to deliver to whom. Well, at least until my boss decided to shuffle every other person around after main course which completely confused them for dessert but hey ho!I'm sure we were a very loud party and I can also only apologise to the lovely waiters for what they may have witnessed during our secret santa present opening session, which err may or may not have involved onesies and edible underwear... hmm enough said I think.

The portions are surprisingly generous and the food does fill you up, unlike some other French restaurants I've been to.Though their dark chocolate tart sounded incredibly enticing, I went with a blood orange sorbet because it sounded like a light option after a fairly heavy meal.

Also, the atmosphere is a bit foofy but don't let that stop you from coming here to eat one of your best meals!",

    "text": "The whole concept of having to ring a doorbell to be let in is a bit cheezy, but I absolutely love everything else about Gauthier. In my opinion, it's some of the best and most affordable Michelin dining in the city...I've come here so often that the staff recognise me which is a bit embarrassing! It's a great option for vegetarians because Alexis Gauthier places a large focus on perfecting vegetables in his dishes/cooking. They always start you off with a selection of canap\u00e9s - stand-outs include parmesan twists with 'guacamole', beetroot macarons. I also recall I really enjoyed my amuse bouche of chicken liver terrine on one occasion - very classical French cooking! The selection of bread is EXTENSIVE - raisin, bacon/onion, walnut, baguette, sundried tomatoes, sourdough, rye etc - and seriously good. It's even better when it's fresh out of the oven.For starters, the pan fried foie gras is to die for. It's rich, heavy, ridicuously filling, but if you like foie gras it's a must try. The risottos are also delicious though filling - I've tried black truffle, beetroot and chanterelle mushroom ones before - three separate dishes don't worry - not all mixed together! They're sizeable portions but delicious.My favourite main course of all time has to be the Barbary duck breast with carrots and honey glaze. It sounds simple, but my goodness, I think it's the best duck I've ever eaten. The sous-vide halibut is also stunning - so flaky and soft.Gauthier is known for the Louis XV tart from his days with Alain Ducasse. I've never had the opportunity to try the original one, but this one is pure chocolate/hazelnut heaven. There's praline inside, mousse, dark chocolate, different layers (5 if i I counted correctly)...yum. The mille-feuilles are also delicious - the puff pastry is perfect! The marshmallows, mini lemon tarts and truffles served as petit fours are fabulous as well. Every time I've been to Gauthier I've easily spent 3 hours in the dining room. It's very romantic in the evening, perfect for dates or special occasions. Service is impeccable, and there's free filtered still and sparkling water! It definitely achieves the vibe of being invited into someone's home for a meal - you'll be well taken care of at Gauthier.",

Anyway, we finally made it to Gauthier Soho over a year late!Alexis Gauthier is a familiar face and name to fans of MasterChef where he has shared his cooking skill, using intuition and instinct to contestants on the show. Incredibly, there are no measuring or timing devices in his kitchenHe opened his eponymous restaurant in a Regnency townhouse in Soho in 2010 and is already the holder of one Michelin star. Amusingly, just like a real house, you have to ring a doorbell to be admitted into the restaurantFortunately, the welcome was warm as we were ushered into the downstairs dining room - the restaurant does retain its of air of being a house but with the unfussy friendliness of the staff, it did make for a relaxed dining atmosphere, which is my preferenceMy sister and I settled on the tasting menu but substituting one of our main courses for the wagyu beef - my sister had never tried it and I wanted to introduce her to it. We had a nice plate of canapes to nibble on while perusing the menu. We were also impressed that the sommelier was genuinely helpful in homing in on exactly what my sister would like and there was no upselling. Tap water was offered without prompting1. Yuzu & miso curd, seafood fricasee & smoked brothThe dishes arrived dramatically at the table under domed covers, which were whipped off to release a puff of smoke and the broth was then poured onto the curd and fricasee. Interesting idea of the citrus yuzu offsetting the perfectly cooked seafood. However, I think the dish needed a little balancing with more citrus required to combat the umami hit of the broth2. Foie gras, apple & crisp artichokes, red shallots & sweet vinegar port reductionI love foie gras and hence I loved this dish. The accompaniments served to cut through the rich foie gras encased in a lovely crispy shell3. Morel risotto, veal jus & parmesanSimple dish but delicious and the morels died in a good cause!4. Red mullet & langoustine, fennel, confit tomato & Meyer lemon jalapeno-lime juiceThe langoustine was probably my favourite ingredient of the night - sweet and juicy5. Welsh lamb - braised shoulder & pink cannon, pommes fondantes & Swiss chardWonderfully pink lamb skilfully cooked6. Substitute main course of Wagyu beef, round fries & larded carrots & onionsThe beef was amazingly tender as hoped for though it wasn't the best wagyu dish I've tasted but I've been extraordinarily blessed to have eaten at some amazing 3 star restaurants7. Selection of unpasteurised French cheesesThese arrived with biscuits and accompaniments8. Exotic fruits, caramelised pineapple & mango sorbetProbably the weakest dish on the menu where the fruits weren't that exotic for 2012 though it did cleanse the palate9. Golden Louis XV, praline souffleThis was actually 2 desserts in 1 dish. We got a mini souffle which was lovely and light. The Golden Louis XV was a chocolate dessert - wafer interior with a wonderful layer of decadently rich chocolate, which was much lighter than it looked. The Louis XV was topped with gold leaf, which pleased my CTG (Chinese Thrift Gene) in making me feel like I was getting value for menu but I'm not sure about the point of gold leaf besides perhaps resurfacing any gold crowns you might have. It doesn't actually taste of anythingMy sister and I had a great evening here as well as a top notch meal. Leaving the restaurant felt like leaving a high class dinner party, which reflects well on the ambiance created by the staff at Gauthier",

    "text": "Hmmm. For the kind of money we paid, was expecting a lot more. It was a nice evening, and it wasn't \"bad\".First, the much vaunted service. Yes, there are heaps of waiters, but they've got this old-fashioned French restaurant hierarchical thing going on, where e.g. the bread and water boys do only that, the sommelier is the only person you can speak to about your wine, or touch your wine bottle... when this works, great, but the evening we went they were tieing themselves in knots a little and the whole service was uncoordinated. E.g. aperitifs coming up after the first course; wine being delayed; the second course being served about 30 seconds after my wife left for the bathroom; signalling to various waiting staff numerous times before the appropriate person could be summoned. This is BS guys, if you run your service like this, you need to be all over these kind of things. The food: one *outstanding* dish (aspagus eel broth thing, properly blow-away cooking), the rest forgetable (and, actually, given this meal was a few weeks ago, I've actually forgotten the rest of the meal, goes to show!).As a result, we were not particularly impressed. If you're going to blow \u00a375+ per person on a meal, it needs to be great all round, and this wasn't. Sorry!",

They get creative with flavors and ingredients, the staff are incredibly well versed in the menu options and are always more than happy to help in any way they can. \u00a0 They offer a private dining room upstairs, but even the main dining room is very chilled out and great for catching up with friends or a romantic date.",

    "text": "Gauthier was a very enjoyable meal - I found that the service was attentive from the get-go (we were never left waiting or wanting; the time between courses was perfect), the food beautifully executed, and the entire dining experience to be a bit more intimate (in a good way!) than the typical Michelin star venue. A number of reviews below already highlight the culinary items on the Tasting Menu, so in lieu of providing another summary, I thought best to describe why Gauthier gets a 4* instead of a 5* from me. And that rationale falls under two main categories:1/ Apart from the signature \"stars of the show\", the rest of the menu is delicious but not particularly memorable. The Black Truffle Risotto was sublime. Really, really tasty; I would rank it among the top dishes that I have ever had in a restaurant. Almost as good was the Louis XV chocolate praline dessert: light, rich, crunchy, and decadent. But failing these clear highlights, I struggle to remember other items from the menu. Obviously, I could look these up quite easily - but I find that the mark of an incredible meal is the tastes, smells, textures linger with you for weeks and months after eating.2/ Wine Pairings were a disappointment, especially if (like me) you went for the full 8 glass option. While there were a couple of enjoyable surprises (a rich, spicy Uruguayan Red with the Venison plat principal) - I found most selections to not be terribly interesting. The most egregious example of this was a glass of NV Dow's Tawny to go with the cheeses. Not that I didn't enjoy the Port. I just expect a bit more creativity out of the sommelier.",

Greedy maybe, but the food, service and value for money (especially lunch) are remarkable. I am not a fan of lamb, and would never choose it on a menu, but the mint-rubbed lamb on the tasting menu was absolutely amazing. This is the restaurant I judge others by as I have never been disappointed with any aspect of the experience. Thoroughly recommend the lunch tasting menu - \u00a340 for five stellar courses and a glass of champagne.",

The kinda chips with the avocado were delicious!!!The tasting menu was well sized, small portions so that we could enjoy the whole menu without feeling atrociously sick afterwards. And that's almost a first for me. Usually after such a menu, I feel happy but horribly over-eating :D This was not the case this time.The dishes I preferred in the menu were the truffle risotto with its brown butter & jus - just divine - and the Louis XV chocolate pud. God that was good! The sweets with the coffee were also nice: rose macaron, chocolate truf, almond cake... Overall, it was very high quality food. But simple cooking, and simple presentation. Nothing uber fancy in comparison to other high class restaurant. Which is nice actually. Straight forward flavours, and you see what you eat. But that's also why I only put 4 starts, not 5. More creativity would have been perfect.The wines we had were also very very nice. Well chosen for us, and went super well with the food. And surprisingly not too expensive in comparison to the rest. The location is great, in a vibrant area so that it's easy to go out for a drink afterwards. The interior is very high end, what you would expect from such an expensive restaurant. Nothing eccentric, but just classy and simply smart. The staff was very professional, attentive and very friendly. I would recommend for a very special occasion. Definitively not a go-there-every-week place ;))) Give it a try, and indulge.",
