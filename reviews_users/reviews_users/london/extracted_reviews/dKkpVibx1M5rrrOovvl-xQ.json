The menu was compact but had lots of good stuff on it. I went for smoked haddock with poached egg and colcannon, and then the treacle tart and clotted cream. Both very delicious, filling, simple, no nonsense dishes, exactly what I expected from this place. \u00a345 for two courses & wine. We went to the downstairs bar afterwards, service a little slower, and the drinks very expensive, but a very nice way to finish off the evening.",

    "text": "I recently went to Hix for the first time taking a friendout to dine there for her birthday. The service was extremely attentive fromthe get go, we were greeted warmly and immediately taken to our table. We werelead into a buzzing and very cool dining room where most of the modern artwork from the likes of Hirst and Tracy Emin \u00a0hangs from the ceiling in the form ofmobiles. I had expected these pieces which I had heard about to be more prominent,some were rather small and easy to miss, but when they were nonetheless an attractivefeature. The food began great. Crisp crackling with near perfectapple sauce was brought as a snack while we ordered and got our drinks. Onrecommendation I ordered the 'heaven and earth'. This was exactly what I hadexpected form the much lauded Mark Hix, it was simple food made great. Theblack pudding was succulent and sweet while the mash worked as a perfect accompaniment.My guest had the duck and apple salad which she was very pleased with. Unfortunatelythe quality of food deteriorated from here on. My mallard was just ok. It was abit too dry and the jelly it was served with didn't compliment the duck. Myguest left most of her liver and bacon. We then opted for a light desert as wewere quite full \u00a0a shot of sloe gin jelly and cream. There was nothing amazingabout this dish. Hix doesn't come cheap and at rates this high I would expectbetter consistency with their food. They can obviously do very good food, asproven with the dishes at the beginning of the meal, but not everything isexecuted this well. I tried to really like the place, and I did a bit. It's verytrendy, modern in just the right way and has an exciting crowd; I just wish thefood was just as good. I would like to think we went on a bad day. I'm not sureI will go back, but be sure to try Mark's Bar downstairs.",

    "text": "This is a place by HIX. The one and only Mark Hix. That in itself, if you listen to London's food scene, should warrant 5 stars. Blasphemy, then, that I award 3. But not all is well at Hix Soho.The room: very New York-y cool, but not loud enough for that. If you want to go for that Minetta Tavern or Spotted Pig vibe, you need at least 75 decibels (according to Ryan Sutton, at least). Here it was decidely less, and it didn't help that those two 6-year old sisters on the table next to us were obviously raised to Victorian standards.The food: As much as I loved the skirt steak with bone marrow, the latter was topped with breadcrumbs which made the whole affair simply too heavy. For once, an American \"are you still working on this\" would have been appropriate. Overall: good food, but a Hawksmoor visit is preferable. The bar: We then went downstairs, into the epicentre of Soho cool. It started according to script; there he was, the man himself, standing by the bar, chatting with Julian (his executive chef) and a girl who works at Caprice Holding (don't know her name). Then you scan the room for the crowd. Hm. Well, no ageism here, but both median and average would be in the fourties. Chic? Definitely. Hip? Perhaps, a few years ago.After two whiskies (sorely needed for digestive purposes), the tab ran overall to about 80 quid per soul. Is it worth checking out? Why, it's a Hix place, sure it is. Will I return? Meh.",

    "text": "I am still contemplating whether I should give Hix Soho 2 or 3 stars. Hopefully by the time I've finished writing this review I will gain some sense of clarity. I visited Hix Soho for the post-theatre experience so greatly advertised on the website. The restaurant itself from the outside is just one of many doors in Soho which can lead to wonders of all different sorts once you're through them. Leaving a couple of the street-facing windows open teased passers-by as it gave them the chance to take a peek into the restaurant and people having their food.Walking into the restaurant, we were greeted by two ladies and were immediately taken to our table. I have read the other reviews on yelp and I personally found that the service was not bad, although a little touchy feely (especially by the American waiters who gave us a smooth touch on the shoulder every time they wanted to see whether we'd like something). Some waiters were better than others, but the food and drinks arrived promptly. The only downside was the fact that we didn't get any bread to start and we had to ask for it again. By the time it arrived, our food was on the table.Now, on to the food itself. Sadly, it was greatly underwhelming. I've had better food in gastropubs, for a quarter of the price. I got the mutton with ramsons, had a bite, smothered it in salt and pepper, had a couple of extra bites, but it just lacked that oomph that would make me go crazy over it. My dining compadres felt the same - one didn't finish his fish, two others got the hanger steak and bone marrow but did not enjoy the latter and the last person got a steak. He was quite happy with it and probably made the best choice out of all of us, but found it small given the price.I've decided to give Hix 3 stars, and that's because pudding saved the day. I had the apple pie with ice cream and custard. It was good, so I left the place on a bit of a high, but not good enough to make up for the mediocre food. \u00a0Maybe Hix marketed itself as the wrong kind of restaurant. Maybe it's not a British restaurant, but a steak house with a British twist, because when it came to the British kitchen itself, it failed to excite us. Or, maybe it's just a cool bar with a nice restaurant upstairs. I walked through the bar briefly to use the bathroom and thought 'I'm definitely coming back to Hix again - but just for a drink this time'.",

    "text": "I'm not someone who enjoys giving 1 star reviews. \u00a0In fact, I had quite the internal battle of whether I should give Hix 2 stars or 1 star. \u00a0I'll start off by saying that the food, while not mind blowing, was good. \u00a0None of us got terribly complicated dishes, 3 of the 4 of us got salads, so I couldn't say what the pricier mains were like, though the other tables around us looked to be enjoying their meals. The first bad omen of the night happened as we tried to make a reservation. \u00a0They assured us that yes, they had a table for 4 at 9 PM, yet for some reason they had to call us back to confirm (this was at around 8 PM, mind you.) \u00a0Naturally, they forgot to call us back. \u00a0We phoned them at 8:45 to confirm and they denied ever even speaking to us. \u00a0That was not a good idea on their part as our empty stomachs caused us to raise hell until they found our name and confirmed. \u00a0When we arrived, the ditzy hostess had trouble finding our name on the list and I can't say we were surprised. \u00a0It wasn't terribly busy either-- I guess for a Tuesday they were busier than most restaurants but they should be able to handle that, no? \u00a0So we wait half an hour downstairs at the hobbit sized bar and had a bottle of wine, not the end of the world. \u00a0When we were eventually seated, we ordered fairly quickly and both the appetizers we got came out in good time. \u00a0The pork cracklings were delicious but a very small portion. \u00a0I guess who eats pork cracklings like their pringles so maybe the portion was appropriate (if it were up to me, everyone would). \u00a0The fried cauliflower was good but also a smaller portion and not memorable, the batter was a bit too thick and still gooey. \u00a0After our apps we proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait. And order more bread, which they claimed (after we waited for 15 minutes) they had to bake fresh. \u00a0And then we waited some more. \u00a0By the time 10:30 rolled around, we called over the maitre' d, who had been nothing but pleasant our whole meal. \u00a0Here's where things got ugly. \u00a0We told him everyone in the restaurant had been served before us (they had) and that we really only ordered salads (we did) so what's the hold up? \u00a0He proceeded to interrupt us at any chance he got and quipped about there being steak in the salads so it takes a while (mine was still very very rare when it came out, I can't imagine it was cooked more than 7 minutes). \u00a0He was combative and condescending when all he really had to do was apologize and assure us we were being taken care of and apologize again. \u00a0When we hinted that he needed to take care of us i.e. comp us a bottle of wine or something, he came back with a snippy remark about us not giving him a chance to tell us he was going to do that. \u00a0He was so rude that all of us kind of froze-- one of those \"is this really happening?\" moments. \u00a0When the food finally did arrive 5-10 minutes later, again in a rude condescending tone, he offered a bottle of wine to make up for whatever we were displeased about. \u00a0Again, wrong choice of words and he shouldn't have even offered, he should have just sent it over! \u00a0We politely declined because there was nothing genuine about the offer and we just wanted to eat and get outta there.I ate my hanger steak salad quickly, it was nothing special at all. \u00a0There were about 4 leaves of lettuce and the beets tasted like they came from a jar. \u00a0My friend had the fish sticks which were good but a bit cold. \u00a0They were served with mushy peas which I love, but lets be honest, mushy peas are pretty hard to mess up. \u00a0A friend ordered a side of minted peas and beans which was surprisingly my favorite dish of the meal. \u00a0Very simple, fresh and paired well with the hanger steak. \u00a0I should also add that we loved the Dogs Head Sauvignon Blanc that we ordered earlier in the night, probably the 2nd best thing about the meal.It's really difficult to separate the service from the quality of the food, especially when you're paying good money for it. \u00a0I understand kitchens get backed up, orders get lost or forgotten, people mess up. \u00a0It happens! \u00a0But in the service industry, your only job is to please your customers and if they're not pleased with anything, you fix the problem. \u00a0Hopefully it was just this guy, not the establishment as a whole, that wasn't familiar with the adage \"the customer is always right.\"Oh and I have to mention something that really irked me: \u00a0the font on the menu. \u00a0I know, I KNOW-- it's totally nit picky and silly. \u00a0But Lucinda Handwriting? RLY? Was Comic Sans not available? \u00a0The look of the menu did not scream 'fashionable, trendy, overpriced eatery.' \u00a0It screamed 'Denny's in New Jersey,' \u00a0Though that's a little unfair because I've always gotten nothing but excellent service at the Denny's off Route 1.",

The d\u00e9cor, as expected, is sleek and modern. \u00a0There are a number of quirky mobiles hanging throughout the restaurant which had a certain Alexander Calder feeling. \u00a0As we were led to our table, it was obvious the restaurant was in the first few weeks of opening. \u00a0There was a bit of nervous energy from the wait staff and confusion over who was to attend to our table. \u00a0Luckily for us, one gentleman with a large board of meat came over to our table to explain the various items on the menu. \u00a0He was excellent and well informed on the types of cuts, the origin on the meat and its preparation. \u00a0However, we quickly learned that he wasn't our waiter and we would have to wait another 15 minutes for that reveal (30 minutes in total). \u00a0As we had nearly finished a bottle of Prosecco, our waitress finally introduced herself. \u00a0She had a very ominous presence and we each wished that the other gentleman would return. \u00a0One of my friends asked which of the fish options was lightest and her answer was that \"we were at the wrong restaurant.\" \u00a0 Despite her lack of pleasantry, we thoroughly enjoyed the meal. \u00a0 But, our next let down came within minutes of finishing dinner. \u00a0 My friend had planned ahead with the restaurant and she had secured a section of the lounge downstairs for after dinner drinks and for other friends to join. \u00a0She had spoken several times to the manager prior to the evening. \u00a0As she was eating, the manager came over and informed her that for us to retain the area in the lounge, individuals in our party would need to order food. \u00a0What? \u00a0That's fine if we were informed prior to the day's event or even upon arrival. \u00a0But, to have the gall to explain this within minutes of finishing dinner seemed very uncouth. \u00a0 Regardless of the several blips in the experience, we still had a great time and the food was excellent. \u00a0I may suggest visiting the Smithfield location first",

Cold cocktails, warm cocktails (warm cocktails?!) all served in unique glasses alongside yummy pork scratchings and apple sauce. Yum-my! Our group of 5 let the bartender choose drinks for us but the warm ale with bramley apple with spices was a favourite! Once my girlfriends were finished fawning over said gorgeous bartender, we headed upstairs for lunch. Well, we just had to try almost everything. Cod's Tongue, Black Pudding, Fish Fingers, Partridge with Bread Sauce and hello! the rice pudding with drunken plums.... Everyone say it together now, \"Dee-lish!\" The Maitre D' talked us through the unique art hanging around the place (must be nice to have friends like Damien Hirst), but the atmosphere was unpretentious and I'm going back - again and again and again. A great spot if you want to impress the man in your life.",

    "text": "Mark Hix, celebrity British chef extraordinaire. \u00a0A good start for me on this London dining holiday. \u00a0Hix Soho, now just simply referred to as Hix, is on a somewhat quieter part of Soho. \u00a0When we arrived at the massive wooden door, a doorman put his hand on it, and asked about our business. \u00a0After he confirmed that we have a booking for dinner, he let us in. \u00a0Thinking about it now, since the downstairs Mark's Bar is quite the happening lounge, perhaps Mr Doorman was posted on the street for crowd control?I started the evening with an aperitif called the Monk's Alchemy. \u00a0Hendrick's gin, chamomile syrup, Aperol, bitters, and I believe lemon juice. \u00a0Summer in a glass! \u00a0The only weird thing was the dried chamomile flowers floating on top. \u00a0We had 2 kinds of oysters (Brownsea Island & Maldon) with Sillfield Farm sausages. \u00a0Is it a British thing to eat tiny smoked sausages with raw oysters? \u00a0The oysters were plump and briny, simply delicious. \u00a0For starters, we had Wood Roasted Pigeon & Girolle (Scottish chanterelle) toast, and Grilled Evesham Courgettes with Blue Monday & Pickled Walnuts. \u00a0The meaty chunks of pigeon provided a good foil for the woodsy mushroom. \u00a0The ribbons of zucchini were nicely grilled, except the Blue Monday came in big chunks and completely obliterated the courgettes. \u00a0Incidentally, Blue Monday is a blue named after the New Order song. \u00a0How brilliant is that?For our mains, we had Grilled Megrim Sole with Seashore Vegetables, and Whole Red Gurnard with Shrimp & Samphire. \u00a0For the sole, think Meryl Streep in Julie & Julia, taking a bite of the Sole Meuniere. \u00a0Yeah, it's like that. \u00a0A red gurnard is a kind of rockfish, bottom-dwellers similar to scorpion fish. \u00a0Ugly as hell, but very tender and mild flesh. \u00a0The little brown shrimps provided added sweetness. \u00a0The samphire (sea beans) gave off appropriate brine to really brought the dish to the sea. \u00a0For sides, we had the Scrumpy-fried green tomatoes. \u00a0Scrumpy is a cider, so think beer-battered. \u00a0Perfectly tart and juicy green tomatoes. \u00a0Ah, summer.A bottle of 2009 Chateau Fonscolombe special cuvee rose was a perfect complement to our sea adventure. \u00a0The meal was finished off with a nice bowl of fresh raspberries and Jersey cream.Why 3 stars? \u00a0I gave Hix 3 stars in relation to the entire food experience I had in this trip. \u00a0It was a good introduction to modern British cuisine. \u00a0Some dishes were standouts, although others probably could use some fine tuning. \u00a0The restaurant was operated as a well-oiled machine. \u00a0Somehow gave off the feeling of all business, no soul. \u00a0The downstairs bar might have been a great place to hang out, but alas, a long flight and a long day of sightseeing crept up on me.",

Surely this was a weird dream brought about by unbalanced humours or lack of red meat? But there I was sitting in the peculiar high ceilinged space, a cross between a glam speakeasy and a chop house. Hix himself has had a long association with the YBA's, which explains the hallucinatory artwork hanging in the restaurant, The food itself tended more towards well-grounded than high falutin' artistry. The signature Heaven and earth tasting deeply earthy with a deep, strong meaty flavour and texture, offset very well by the creamy smooth potato. Lincolnshire onion tart, unusually for such a meatily masculine restaurant was the star of the meal. Smooth and unctuous onions were not at all overpowering, and it came topped with a poached egg. A shade overdone for my taste, but still delicious. On to the mains. Hanger steak with roast brown marrow was tasty, but not as tender as some I've had. The bone marrow was very marrowish, dressed with parsley and garlic, it was richly glutinous and almost too much. My hogget chops were delicious, marbled with thick veins of lamby fat, the pink meat was tender with an almost gamey taste. It came \"garnished\" with massive wedges of roast squash and cobnuts. I can't speak for the partridge because, by the time I moved in to take a nibble, it'd been hovered up, a neat pile of bones left gleaming on the plate. I suspect it was pretty tasty. The food was hearty, heavy and unashamedly English. The cooking was as robust as the ingredients. This was not the place for subtle textures and delicate touches. I waddled out feeling like i had swallowed a cannonball. Albeit very tasty cannonball.",

    "text": "Another rainy Friday night in London found me hooking up with my old pal Bernard at the Two Chairmen in Westminster for a couple of pints of the excellent Deuchars while we waited for B and the lovely Mrs Mitton to join us. As ever the pub was filled with a motley crew of \"suits\", in fine Friday night form, from the various government offices in the neighbourhood and by the time we left at around 6pm the pub was heaving. The venue for dinner had been the subject of much email traffic during the week and the suggestions had ranged far and wide both in terms of location and cuisine. As we only too rarely have the chance to get together we were after something a bit sophisticated but still conducive to a good natter and at a reasonable price. So it was that we alighted on the Soho branch of the Hix empire. Situated behind a heavy wooden door on a busy Brewer Street you have the choice of making your way downstairs to the basement bar or entering the light and airy restaurant on your left. The bar was buzzing and packed to the rafters so, as we had just made it in time to catch the end of the pre-theatre deal, three courses for \u00a319.50, we quickly settled ourselves down at our nicely presented and reasonably spacious round table. It's a well laid out, stylish room with plenty of space between you and your fellow diners. A long bar runs almost the length of one side of the room with some striking artistic installations hanging from the ceiling above which all add to a rather restrained but appealing sense of theatre. I particularly liked the stuffed seagull suspended within neon circles and the mobile made up of a variety of fish set within glass bricks. It's a popular place, I would definitely recommend booking well in advance, and by 7.30pm the room had reached full capacity. However, unlike many other dining rooms I have experienced recently, I was struck by the excellent acoustics and how easy it was to carry on a conversation despite a very cheerful and chatty crowd. We kicked off with a fine bottle of Bellarosa Prosecco, and some tap water, while we had a quick glance at the menu. The pre-theatre selection is not going to detain you long as it's a choice from two for each course but in a way that's no bad thing. The boys had the lamb's kidneys served on a bed on bramley apple pur\u00e9e. Cooked rare these little beauties were soft to the touch and had a distinct but subtle flavour which was well complemented by the slightly sharp fruit. The ladies had the selection of beets with goats curd and walnuts which got murmurings of approval and seemed to go down very well. We moved on to a reasonably priced bottle of Bodegas Airen which was an ideal companion to the smoked haddock which sat on a bed of buttery colcannon surrounded by a sea of creamy sauce, and topped with a perfectly poached egg. Beautifully cooked and full of flavour this was a tasty piece of fish and was presented simply but effectively. Bernard had the rib eye steak which he proclaimed to be cooked \"just right\" and suitably beefy. I liked the nice touch of serving it with an accompaniment of three tiny selections of mustard on a small tray. A man who likes his frites Bernard had ordered some chips in addition to his crispy potato \"strings\" which were gratefully shared amongst the table and again hit the spot. The dark chocolate mousse for dessert was a very decent size portion and was particularly toothsome without falling into the typical mousse trap of being too sweet or rich. Mrs Mitton's \"pixie\" apple pie was anything but small and was declared to be a proper job and full of fruit, gaining the accolade of \"best shortcrust pastry I've ever tasted\". As ever it was the digestifs that began to bump up the bill despite our restraint in sticking to the pre- theatre menu. However, it's the little details that count and I thoroughly enjoyed my glass of Poire Williams and Bernard declared himself well satisfied with his Martel. All things considered we thought this was a very good dining experience, in lovely surroundings, with great company and at a reasonable price. However, looking at the standard menu I'm not so sure I would have felt the same if I had gone \"off piste\" as the prices did seem a little steep for what was on offer (the fish fingers, chips and mushy peas will set you back \u00a316 and that's the cheapest offering). We had another quick look at the quirky, clubby bar, which had thinned out considerably by 9pm. With its bar billiard table and tasty selection of bar snacks it looked very appealing and we decided to add it to our \"must try out\" list. It was then time to head back into the Soho night and send the Mittons on their merry way back to Cambridge. Job well done Mr Hix!!",

    "text": "Shit service, Hix. If you've read my previous review, I came here and raved about the place. Well not this time. A busy Friday night and we were treated to crappy service from the door staff and left to wait. And wait. And wait. This was to be the theme of the night. We waited to be seated. Were forgotten about and when we got to our table, waited for menus. Nope. Got my own menu. Waited to order. Waited. Waited. Waited. Finally we ordered and got some sub-par cocktails. And a plate of radishes. WTF. We ate them anyway because I hadn't had dinner and a free vegetable is good in my books. Except it wasn't free. At over \u00a310 and \u00a312 for our respective cocktails, I didn't feel the need to hang around for more of that service. So we asked for the bill. Can you guess what happened next?Waited. When it eventually came, they had not only included service but also \u00a33 for the radishes we hadn't even asked for. You can't charge for something that people don't order. This isn't Spain where a table charge is commonplace. We waited again to pay. They have one credit card machine. When they eventually came over I said that the service had been appalling, but I didn't even get an apology or offer to take the service off the bill. Basically it was shit.",

    "text": "After walking through pretty much all of the shops on Oxford Street this last Sunday, my girlfriend and I were in dire need of resting our feet and enjoying a cocktail. She had been to Hix before so we knew it would be a solid place for a drink or two. Hix is the main restaurant, with Mark's being their bar in the basement where you can find fantastic libations and loung on comfy couches and chairs while having a snack or two. We started out with some parsnip crisps and chips with curry sauce. The crisps were salted nicely and the bowl was empty in no time. The chips (french fries) were thin and crunchy, just the way I like them and the curry sauce was delicious.My first cocktail was the \"Pharmaceutical Stimulant\" (yelp.com/biz_photos/dKkp\u2026) - Belvedere vodka shaken with Mark's espresso & grue de cacao liqueur and espresso. The drink packed a big punch and was delicious. The espresso and cacao complimented one another and paired well with the vodka. My second drink was the Golden Eagle - Beafeater London dry gin poured with Bitter Truth apricot brandy, Cocchi Americano and Bitter Truth orange bitters, topped with Burrow Hill Farm Cider. This drink was equally amazing, carrying a very refreshing aftertaste from the cider.I ordered the British Farmhouse Cured Meats (yelp.com/biz_photos/dKkp\u2026), which was a solid portion of assorted, amazing charcuterie. We also got their trip of appetizers (yelp.com/biz_photos/dKkp\u2026) - pureed beets and goat curd served with toasted ciabatta; haggis and neep croquettes, and chopped smoked salmon & chive tarts. My favorite was the beets and goat cheese, as those two items just work so well together. The smoked salmon was very overpowering in flavor, I wish the chives would have stood out a bit more. The tarts were nice and crunchy, though. As for the haggis and neep croquettes, they were very interesting. It was my first time having haggis and I quite like it, but it may be due to the untraditional way it was served in a croquette ball along with the mashed turnips inside. Service was a bit slow at times, as there was only one bartender and one server with the place getting quite busy, but we were relaxing and in no hurry, so it wasn't a big deal. Mark's at Hix is certainly a fun place for amazing craft cocktails and some yummy small bites. I'd really like to try the restaurant next time.Cocktails ran between 9-12 GBP and bites were between 4-10 GBP. Pretty standard for the area and London in general.",

I'm not blown away, but the bar was comfortable, relaxed and played decent music.Props for the strange looking fox sporting a monocle sitting on the bar, and also for having a table for a yet undetermined snooker derivative game with what looks like mushrooms sprouting out of the table. If any Yelpers out there can tell me what game this is I would be much obliged. Love the American couple who played the 'Supermario Billiards' game with such purpose and determination.

I'm glad they've decided to put a sign up because I've often seen customers trying to find the entrance to this restaurant - yes, push the big wooden door with no sign - and there didn't use to be a sign outside, just a menu.As I had just had lunch, I wasn't after a full meal. So what could cause me to make a detour? Well, I'm a coinnoisseur or pork scratchings and Hix is famous for serving Blythburg pork scratchings with apple sauce as a bar snack/starter.So, I popped in to ask if I could purchase some to take away. The very helpful receptionist didn't miss a beat and rang stright down to the kitchen to find out. The chef kindly rustled up a little container to put them and I was soon off with my little snacks safe and sound.So were they the best pork scratchings ever? Well, the chicharron I had from the Ferry Buiilding is still the best but that's for another review. However, these were good - thick and crispy without too much fat. Perhaps a little too salty in parts and I'm not sure the apple sauce added anything though it did make a good accompaniment to some pork I cooked at home the next day.",

Nestled behind Piccadilly Circus, tucked away from the crowds and below the main restaurant, downstairs you'll find Mark's - one of the best places I've found to have a drink in central London.The decor is reminiscent of a gentleman's club/lounge with a funkier edge that feels a bit New York-esque. Either way, sink into the seats, make sure you accept a recommendation from the waiter - and prepare for a big bill.Sure the drinks are expensive, but they're delicious, and as a pre-cursor to a dinner somewhere in Soho - this place is awesome. Though the menu does say that they'll have to charge you for food if you sit, they'll just bring a few nuts and add to the cheque. Make sure you book!",

The drinks are expensive, there is no denying that. But they are worth it and not short on alcohol. And the service can sometimes be slow but don't let that fool you, they are working. Making just magical drinks takes time. Just sit at the bar and watch some time, its quite fun, especially since the work area behind the bar is sunken so you site at eye level with the bartenders. Last time I went the waiter came and sat down to talk with us about drinks and even the odd fruit they put in the Zombie (trust me, try it- it comes in a goblet, on fire). The drinks can be a hit or miss depending on what you like, but that's why the waiters and bartenders are there to answer questions. The first time I went I had no idea what to order. The throwback decor also isn't quite like anywhere else I've come upon in London yet.",

It is a bit hard to find at first -- the door isn't quite a door and, from the street, one can easily miss it. \u00a0When you enter, there is a coat check straight in front of you. \u00a0The dining room is one big open space, with various tables and a long bar. \u00a0I decided for the bar -- being by myself, this gave me some great conversations, including with a restaurateur next to me who is friends with Mark Hix and the bartender.The food and drink is superb:- I started with a Cotswold Beer on draft, which was refreshing and full of flavor- Appetizer was Lamb Sweetbreads: \u00a0Delicious, actually somewhat doughy, with bacon bits and a cream sauce. \u00a0Really very nice.- I then had the Pork Chop which came with locally sourced small carrots and other roots. \u00a0It was cooked to triumphant perfection.This place is excellent, and I had a fantastic time. \u00a0Next time I am in the city, I will check out the bar downstairs, which evidently recently won the Best Bar in London award from Time Out.",

    "text": "I know this place is the darling of restaurant critics so was keen to try.We had a pre dinner cocktail in the cocktail bar downstairs. We had tried to go there for drinks on a previous occasion but were told at the door it was 'full' (ie 'No'). Perhaps you only gain entry if you have a meal reservation or perhaps we didn't look fabulous enough (they were probably right on that one).The vintage vibe works well. Ditto for the cocktails which were good but were tres petite and didn't quite live up to the promise set by the menu description + the high price. Then our friendly waitress escorted us to our table upstairs. A cool and well designed space with some large mobiles hanging from the ceiling. Atmosphere was boisterous, testosterone fueled.Starters were probaby the highlight ( a pumpkin cream dish and something else which I have forgotten) but main courses were just OK. I had a smoked haddock dish with a mustard sauce. Good but not special. My partner had a type of fish 'stuffed with herbs.' They had run out of the original (red snapper, I think) on the menu so substituted gurnard instead. We pictured a whole fish with fresh bunches of aromatic herbs bursting out from the underside. What came was inded a whole fish, roasted until it was rigid with a few flecks of parsley dotted on the outside. That was it! A bit of a letdown looking forlorn on the white plate. \u00a0It was overcooked and a meh from my partner who had to order some sides to go with it. OK we could have sent it back but at this point we had lost the energy.The menu is steaks and sort of ironic school dinners retro unfussy food ('fish fingers' and stuff) which is fine by me but with high price tag and attitude to match. Given that's the premise, it has to be excellent. It was just hard to get excited about very plain dishes that were OK but not special plus that '2 hour' slot thing that in this case just added to the sum of it.So 2.5 to 3 stars, being generous, since overall the place was fun and buzzy but not somewhere I would return for the food experience. \u00a0Perhaps it was an off night.",

    "text": "I have the full range of experiences at Hix. Lazy lunches, late night food at the upstairs bar and boozy weekends downstairs. All have been great fun. The restaurant proper is upstairs and focuses on delivering fairly straightforward seasonal 'Modern British' food. \u00a0The atmosphere is lively and the service is relaxed and friendly - the waiters/waitresses are engaging and chatty. \u00a0Highlights on the menu which I have tried include the Roast Chicken for two which comes 'stood up' on a special serving dish and is carved in front of you and oysters served with a spoonful of bloody mary sorbet in each shell. \u00a0There is also always a selection of steaks on the menu. \u00a0The cuts of beef are presented to you raw at the table and the pros/cons of each alternative is explained to allow you to make the right selection. \u00a0Sounds weird but is actually quite fun.Downstairs is Mark's Bar. \u00a0This is dominated by an ultra long bar behind which the bartenders work their cocktail magic. \u00a0This is where I like to sit as not only can you get recommendations from the guys who mix the drink but you can see them practice their craft. \u00a0If you don't want to sit at the bar, there are a series of tables/chairs dotted around with table service. \u00a0The Bar does get full pretty quick so if you want to come here at the weekend (or even midweek) it pays to get here early.The cocktail menu here is a journey through the history of cocktails, taking inspiration from each era from history. \u00a0My nemesis is the 'Hix Fix', which is a lethal (in my experience) combination of Morello Cherries in Somerset Eau de Vie and Champagne. \u00a0If you are not a cocktail fan, the list of beers is also good and are all served in a chilled pewter mug - classy!Is this my favourite restaurant - no, probably not, the food is good but not amazing. \u00a0Is it my favourite bar - no, there are other options which are better. \u00a0However, it is a great combination of the two and if you come here a good night is almost guaranteed.",

    "text": "After consulting with 'Timeout' in order to find some good cocktail bars during my last night in London, my friend and I set out to find Mark's Bar.We had the address, we were on the right street, and yet still we couldn't see this elusive place.. Eventually we realised, having walked past it a few times, that it must be inside what was signed as \"Hix'.The door to Hix is a large wooden affair, with a big brass handle and a sign saying 'Push'. \u00a0I felt just like I imagine Alice did when she raised that bottle instructing 'drink me' to her lips..Immediately the sign for Mark's Bar over a staircase was apparent. \u00a0We told the lady on the door we were wanting to go down to the bar but she seemed a little reluctant.. She told us she didn't know if there was room but then allowed us to accompany her down the stairs. \u00a0This, I felt, was an odd choice - she surely should have left us by the door to go and check?Anyway, we got downstairs and loitered by the end of the bar.The place was dark, intimate, with an odd-looking billiards table in the centre. \u00a0The bar was built on a step, so the bartenders had it at the right height but if you stood by it from 'our side' you felt like a giant. \u00a0Instead, chairs filled with cocktail-drinkers lined it.The lady went to ask one of the 3 staff members providing table service. \u00a0There was one free table (though with no chairs) and she seemed rather reluctant to let us go there. \u00a0'It's standing room only' she said, as if that was to be a deterrent.. It wasn't - this place was nicely filled, but clearly was never allowed to get busy. \u00a0I wasn't leaving - the playlist alone wouldn't let me. \u00a0It later became apparent why she had been so cagey - the one empty table was in an area that had been reserved and was occupied by Ronnie Wood of the Rolling Stones. \u00a0(Not that I would have realised.. I'm afraid I'm not of the right age ;) \u00a0)Anyway, it didn't take us long to get a table rather than stand. \u00a0Straight away, our bartender brought us over a glass of water each - a lovely touch, and we ordered our cocktails. \u00a0Expensive, yes, but not as extortionate as I thought they might be, given I was a Northerner in London..!On the subject of the cocktail menu, I would say that you should be prepared to do a lot of reading.. It's not greatly designed, so to sift through the information and stories on the drinks to find the ingredients takes a little time. \u00a0But the staff clearly know their booze and will happily navigate your tastes, with or without the cocktail list.We then asked him about the weird table in the room - it had cues and balls, but also wooden mushrooms.. \u00a0It's Bar Billiards. \u00a0And he talked us through the rules and encouraged us to play.Our bags sat on our table, which wasn't far away. \u00a0It took me a little while to relax into knowing that not only did I not have to worry about leaving them, but the 3 staff on the floor - all of which had said hello and been very friendly - were aware of them too. \u00a0It was really pleasing to know that there was nothing to worry about. \u00a0It was like being in 'my bar' at home, even though I was bang in the centre of the Capital.Half of our table was empty, so (we were asked first if it was OK) an American couple joined us. \u00a0We played Bar Billiards most of the evening, attracting the attention of other punters who asked how it worked. (Calum Best, who I also wouldn't have recognised, and who was with the Rolling Stone, asked me to explain.. Does that make me famous?! hehe) \u00a0Our bartender (who turned out to be the manager), Abou, was super-attentive, made great drinks and looked to be genuinely enjoying himself, and the American couple were lovely to chat to too.I couldn't have asked for a better evening - staff and punters were all wonderfully friendly, drinks were brilliant, music and billiard-based entertainment; top notch. \u00a0I genuinely feel like I'd made new bartender friends and despite knowing that I wouldn't have got in if it wasn't a Tuesday (I imagine a weekend is far more exclusive) I'd definitely be a regular if it wasn't for the fact I live in Leeds..

The food has creative touches, but the menu tries to be mass-market appealing. However, the prices are sky high for an ordinary meal - it almost approached 1 star michelin prices. Inside, the decor and restaurant is very ordinary, and the secret door to the restaurant with a bouncer outside makes it look like a seedy club in Soho. I think this place has been a bit over-hyped and over-priced, for what it really is.",

Buzzy. Bar downstairs really lovely. \u00a0It's a fun place to visit. So even though the sauce didn't work in the starter, still a very nice meal.",

They have bar seating, couches, tables, and high tops. Last time I was here I sat on a chair that was practically on the ground itself.

    "text": "Hix is primarily a British cuisine restaurant, however, it's basement is hiding a brilliant cocktail bar, with a great drinks selection and couches and a lovely atmosphere.On a Saturday night it is normally packed so, even if you may be be able to get a seat if you're lucky, I recommend booking in advance just to be sure. You will need to order a snack or dessert from the menu as they only have a restaurant licence and then you can spend the rest of time drinking cocktails.The staff are all very friendly and welcoming and there's always someone around to help you out and take more orders.The drinks are a bit pricey (\u00a310-15 per cocktail, \u00a37 for beer) so you may want to have that in mind. I always say start from the nice cocktail bar and then move to a pub to drink properly but if you are just going for one drink and an early night it's perfect.In terms of taste, I think there are some better bars with more luxurious feeling drinks but also much worse so this would be the middle ground in my opinion. Not the best but good enough for a fancy bar.In general that is a great place in Soho for when you are with sb who doesn't like pubs and would only drink in cocktail bars because you can both show off your local knowledge and get some nice cocktails in.",

    "text": "What a disappointment. I have been dying to try one of the Hix restaurants and when I saw an offer of 1/2 kilo of steak, salad, chips and a carafe of red for 2 at \u00a350 I snapped it up - that was the only way I was going to be able to afford a steak there! We easily booked a Friday evening table for 2, arrived early and were seated by friendly staff who took our coats and bags. We decided to get a beer, cocktail and some nibbles before our main. Bf got the Hix IPA which was nice but for nearly \u00a37 it is a bit steep, I went for the Fizz-ness (not bad but a bit tasteless) and we shared the parsnip crisps and pork scratchings - both described as lazy i.e. no seasoning, nothing special.Steak, red wine and sides came out after a reasonable time. The steak (ordered medium rare) was cooked to perfection, salad was just a bowl of leaves which came with a dressing and the chips were just plain fries that seemed to come out of the freezer. Also served with some sauces - the butter aioli was good. Red wine was a plus point - tasty and plenty of it. Chips although average were aplenty but the steak for 2 was a bit sparse. We decided not to chance dessert as although some sounded nice (chocolate mousse) on the basis of the rest of the food we didn't think it was worth it.Additional food, drinks and tip came in at \u00a335 for in total \u00a385 - not overly impressed. The waiter asked how the food was and for once Bf and I were honest, literally answering with \"hmm it was OK\". We thought he was going to ignore us however did ask for more feedback on what we thought and said he appreciated it and would feedback in his \"daily report\" (no freebees to pacify our disappointment). All in all a disappointing and expensive Friday night out.",

    "text": "After booking Wilderness Festival this year with a group of friends, we decided to come to Hix in London, since we didn't book it for one of the feasts. The Hix brand has a number of restaurants in London, but I had heard that the Soho location is cool because it has Mark's Bar underneath. To be honest, we didn't really know what type of cuisine the restaurant is known for. Once we arrived, we discussed the wine list and the menu with our waiter, who guided us toward the scallops and the lobster, which I had already been leaning toward. \u00a0My friend and I ended up sharing those two, and our two other friends got the hanger steak with a side of lobster and whole pan fried turbot. We also ordered the crispy sea bass salad for a sharing starter and 2 bottles of Picpoul white wine for the table. All the food I had was great, though understandably not cheap given the quantity of seafood. We went with the sea bass only because it was the only salad on the menu... they could really use some more options. Serving the fish crispy was also an interesting choice, and it turned out a bit like chicken popcorn that you would get at KFC, only made with fish. There was only just enough for a bite for everyone, as the rest was a reasonable amount of leafy greens. The scallops and the lobster were very good and came with a variety of tasty sauces. The staff forgot the chips that were meant to come with our lobster until we reminded them near the end of our meal, and after that it came out quickly. I didn't try any, but the steak and turbot looked great too.I think Hix is a nice restaurant, with a fairly standard, unexciting menu that is well executed. It's not a place that makes any must-eat list. There are some oddballs that I didn't quite get, like eggs benedict as a starter, and Heaven and Earth, which apparently is some version of black pudding. I walked through the bar area downstairs to use the restrooms, and that was a bit of a letdown. It wasn't very busy for a Thursday evening, and had a few groups in there, but was not bustling. Everyone was just seated at their respective tables or the bar, with the exception of one group at a non-standard billiard table. We decided to pass on going to the bar after dinner. There's nothing wrong about Hix, there's just nothing that special either.",

Prime rib was so undercooked it was almost purple and it was chewy and rubbery. Not only was it just a terrible cut of meat but the vegetables were over cooked and hard too. The mushroom soup lacked flavor and it was as if they put mushrooms in a blender, added water and heated it up. All in all this place is either on its way out of business or it should be.",

Good for a date or drinks with your friends.Service was not quick because there were only two wait staff for the whole floor - this is really not acceptable - not so much for the customers but for the staff who must have been seriously stressed.There is a ridiculous \u00a31.50 charge if you don't have food so we ordered some (fancy) chips with curry sauce - the chips were very tasty although the curry sauce served as dipping sauce was tasteless and not thick enough to function effectively.All four cocktails my friends ordered were on the bitter/sour side - this was obvious from the ingredients so not really a surprise but they might consider adding a few sweeter ones to the menu. One of the non alcoholic cocktails had about 6 delicious sounded ingredients but tasted of watery orange juice, however the Shirley Temple was fine.So I guess I'm more of a fan of the look and feel rather than the actual drinks, but that means I'd be keen to come back to prove myself wrong about the latter.",

    "text": "Oh Hix, how I adore thee, let me count the ways.It feels like an age since I first shuffled down the stairs into the basement of Hix on the advice of a close friend. I had just moved to London and was desperate to find the hidden gems in grimy Soho since I knew they existed but had no idea where. My friend brought me to Hix and it feels like I hardly ever leave this place anymore.Technically speaking Hix is a restaurant but I've never eaten there and cannot vouch for the food. The bar is down a set of stairs in the basement of the building and you will be \u00a0greeted by someone as you enter through the door. Those in the 'know' (not that this place is much of a secret) will ask if there are any seats downstairs. Hix's policy is that everyone in the bar should be seated in order to avoid overcrowding and to maintain a smarter environment This means that if you get to go, you will either be seated at a table or at the bar and it doesn't matter how busy they are, you'll never be squeezed between strangers with their back sweat soaked into your lovely dress.There is table service in the bar unless of course you are actually sitting at the bar, in which case be good human being and just speak to the bartenders directly. Drinks range from \u00a310 or so to \u00a314. You can order a Negroni and these guys will make it look like it's the most sophisticated affair in the world. I don't generally go for flashy cocktails and stick to either a Hanky Panky (naughty), Negroni or Espresso Martini. The bartenders are professional and fast. They're not always the chattiest but come on, leave them alone to do their job will you? They will be happy to recommend a drink to you or make one off menu. Curly (my favourite guy) was even kind enough to make 3 separate trips upstairs to the restaurant in order to get more espresso so I could get my \u00a0coffee gin buzz. What a sweetheart!There is a service charge here and sometimes, but not always, you will be asked to pay a small fee for some nibbles due to a licensing issue. Don't ask me, I don't really know but the nibbles are delicious and the drinks strong enough to be worth the money.One last thing I should mention is that Hix are not stuffy and will not discriminate based on what you're wearing, your age or your looks. Come on now, this is London, we don't do that. Do we? I made a quick 5 hour stop here with my partner on a whim after we'd ransacked Primark. Dressed like I was on my way to a slumber party, carrying shopping bags large and small, they accommodated us on a busy Friday evening. My partner was absolutely over the moon as she had kept telling me it was too nice and that they were telling us there was no space because we weren't dressed smartly enough. No babe, you're thinking about that other place... Los Angeles.Get thee to Hix! (12.5% service charge applies.)",

I forgot to mention our hurry when we were sat down, but it did take exceptionally long to order. Orders finally in, it turned out that we were given the wrong menu..! Resolving this added another 10-15 minutes to our wait, so I wasn't really able to relax until we got our mains.We went for the set menu - 2 courses for \u00a319.50 which was good value. We both had the duck with red cabbage and mashed potatoes. It was one of those big plate, small-ish portions type places, but the duck was tender and juicy and it filled me up nicely.After the first course we needed to leave for the theatre but we saved the set menu deal by arranging to come back for dessert after the show. My chocolate mousse was velvety and decadent and wonderful, while the honeycomb added a lovely crunch to it. The boyfriend's cheese really was just a slab of cheddar - although it did come with crackers, butter and a very tasty autumny chutney. He paired his cheese with a lovely port, and I had an espresso martini. Drinks were very nice but on the pricey side.The space is quite trendy - large space with high ceilings, and modern furniture.Overall, the food was good - but not amazing. The service was slow, so don't go if you're in a hurry. I wouldn't mind going back, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.",

I think it's the prices that are keeping traffic down as it was on the high side for brunch in London. I had the burger and my wife had the hanger steak. They walk out the latest meat cuts a la a true steak house which includes filet mignon bone in surprisingly. My wife also had the oysters which she said were the best on a long long time. I'm not a big fan so can't judge. The hanger steak was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The burger though was the star. Chopped short rib meat was amazingly flavourful. Well seasoned which I like and an interesting cocktail sauce made at hix which had a great mix of spicy and sweet. I'll be coming back because there were tons of things on the menu we wanted to try. With Automat closing this will be our new London brunch place.",

That's why you get a 3 instead of a 5. I know what Sunday's are for, that's your B team to make a name but they f-cked this one up big. I could tell when they brought it on t for show they didn't even bring it close enough to the table to show it. I had a bad feeling when that happened. Then they cut it to split for two hoping we were know nothing fools. I am happy with the meal and the starters but the stake house that passes medium well almost stake for mid rare is not in my book cooking for the people they are pricing for. I know a porterhouse is difficult cut because the bone is in and the out side gets cooked faster but I know how to get this done as all chefs that cook at a high caliber do. I was just disappointed in the results. I understand it was a Sunday night but I can't excuse the fact that it was over done. This was a great meal and I loved it all but when you set the bar high I expect you to nail it in every way!",

    "text": "We went here for drinks and dinner with friends who made a reservation in advance. First we went down to the bar- which is as cool as everyone says it is, but also very expensive. We waited around for our table upstairs and our reservation ended up being about 25 minutes late. Upstairs is a bit peculiar- gives off a casual eating kind of vibe that just isn't cohesive with the menu or downstairs area. And the service was really lacking. It took way too long for someone to come over and take orders-in fact we had to grab someone to actually ask for help- and food came out very slowly.But the dish I ordered- duck with beans- was succulent and hearty, though my beans were a bit undercooked. And they had a nice vegetarian menu as well. My date's flank steak was pretty overcooked, but his side of potatoes was nice and buttery. But my biggest issue came even before our dinner plates were cleared. As we sat waiting for someone to clear the table and bring us dessert menus the manager came up to us and told us that they had overbooked and needed us to leave. Meanwhile, the four-top next to us was rapping up dessert- it would have made much more sense to bring them the bill instead of being so rude to people who were not done eating. They told us that they would have a table reserved for us in the bar downstairs, but what they had was four foot rests and a coffee table that no one could eat off of. They offered no apologies, no complimentary drinks/coffees. It was just genuine bad business, and of course none of us ordered dessert afterwards. I'd come back for the bar, but wouldn't waste my breath on the restaurant upstairs. It really was a very off-putting experience, and no one working that staff seemed even remotely confused as to how that would be considered rude to customers.",
