We had an opportunity to try 7 Leguas Blanco as well, and compare the tastes before sampling 6 of the delicious cocktails that could be served up with your tacos or burritos. From the perfect margarita to cocktails with watermelon to espresso, I'm a total convert to tequila-based drinks! To soak up all the tequila, we tried soft tacos filled with beef, pork, chicken or veggies, along with some salad and cheese. Served up on the side were some totopos and toppings of delicious salsa verde or a super hot chili salsa, sour cream and fresh, chunky guacamole. I was in heaven! I'm definitely going to go again - to whichever location is within reach! Muy delicioso!",

Plenty of laughs, lots of food and killer drinks! I was pleased to discover Benito's Hat now has a second location (their original location is on Goodge Street). The food is decent and very well priced and the cocktails are amazing. Want a cheap-n-cheerful meal in a comfy and attractive setting? You'll be wise to keep Benito's Hat in mind.",

    "text": "Benito's Hat in Covent Garden is an interesting addition to the Fitzrovia Benito's Hat, and other brightly coloured Mexican restaurants that have been popping up in London over the last few years. The food follows the tried and tested formula where you select if you want a burrito or taco, the type of meat (based on the qype event last night I'd go with the spicy pork) and fillings. There is the obligatory additional charge for guacamole, so overall nothing too remarkable there. The interesting part is the focus on the cocktail bar. There is an obvious expertise with tequila based cocktails as you would expect. Each month there is a guest brand, and a selection of house cocktails which may vary over time, although I'm sure anything Mexican can be made given their expertise. I believe it may be necessary to order some food when drinking here to comply with their license (nachos may be enough) so it will be good to see how this all works out. Benito's Hat is certainly in a great location to try this welcome move from food towards tequila cocktails.",

    "text": "I very recently ventured into the Benito's Hat near Covent Garden after passing it on opening day. It was one of those stronger than fate days destined for burritos - lo and behold it was opening day! Despite my initial gut reaction calling for the big B I sort of felt compelled to go for the taco. For some reason I thought it was going to be a crispy taco but really it was just a small burrito - guess years of supermarket Mex food has seriously warped my idea of what a taco really is..! It was a good experience... but not a spot on the Goodge Street in terms of service for some reason. Can't completely blame the guys working - it was their first day of work and they were likely finding their feet. I'm sure after a few days it will take off as it's a pretty busy area in dire need of Mexican persuasion!",

    "text": "I was part of a small group of Qypers invited to a preview night of this new branch of Benito's Hat*** Visiting Benito's Hat came at the end of a 2 week long craving for burritos, and this was the ideal place to sate it. We had a sample of fillings from the menu \u00a0I think I tried pork, chicken and veg. All were very tasty, but my particular favourite was the succulent and delicious pork \u00a0especially when combined with the black beans which were so amazing I could (and practically did) just eat them with a spoon. Even the nacho chips here are ideal \u00a0not salty or greasy, just the perfect receptacle for scooping up any of the wonderful salsas (try the salsa verde!). Or indeed for scooping up those scrumptious black beans. The main reason we Qypers were invited was to sample the new signature cocktail menu which Benito's is rolling out. We were taken on a journey through the history of the drink, why your cheap off-licence version with the worm in it just doesn't cut the mustard, and what works well with tequila to make a top-notch cocktail. Then the poor unsuspecting staff of Benito's Hat let us loose to formulate our own crazy concoctions \u00a0watch out for the winning cocktail in store! So, what is this new branch like? The d\u00e9cor is bright and fresh \u00a0it doesn't lean towards the tacky let's hang a whole bunch of Mexican rubbish on the walls school of decorating, but neither does it come across as self-consciously trendy. The staff are friendly, and the obvious passion for authentic Mexican food and drink shines through.",

No worms (thats mezcal), no lime, no salt and definately, definately no slamming. This is the good stuff, 100% blue agave and as such deserves some respect. This forms the basis of the super smooth cocktails at Benitos Hat. My fav was the espresso martini but they were all pretty darn good. They have a guest tequila that changes every month so be sure to check back and see what's new. We then got to play around and come up with our own cocktails. Personally I still feel our combination of tequila, lime, gooseberries and caramel was a winner and I may sneak back and try to persuade Ben and Alex to put it on the menu!We also got to sample the burritos and tortilla chips. Surprisingly for a comitted carnivore like myself, I actually liked the veggie ones best. For me the spicy pork could have been a little more spicy. But once I piled the black beans on top, mmn burrito heaven! I would totally come back to Benito's Hat when I'm craving mexican food and I would recommend seeking it out if you're in the covent garden area.",

    "text": "For photos see Greedy Diva @ greedydiva.blogspot.com/\u2026 \u00a0At last a burrito I can respect. The jaw locking pork burrito at Benito's Hat is a behemoth example of what a burrito should be. It is literally bursting with pile upon pile of tender, fragrant shreds of carnitas pork - braised slowly and simmered with lime juice, balsamic vinegar, black pepper, cumin and oregano. The balsamic may lack authenticity, but is a deliberate improvement beyond reproach since it adds a superb kick. It comes topped with mounds of black beans (slow cooked and flavoured with avocado leaves), coriander and lime rice, lettuce, grated Montery Jack, guacamole, sour cream and salsa - all somehow rammed into a soft tortilla. I can't believe what I'm seeing as it's being built. But I keep quiet and watch bemused as they somehow manage to wrap it all up. It costs \u00a35.50 (plus 50p for the guacamole). Bargain. The Peanut Gallery's chargrilled steak burrito is right up there with the pork. Marinated overnight in chipotle chilies, lime and spices the lean meat is supremely tender with an earthy, smoky flavour - he opts for the slow cooked pinto beans with paprika instead of the black beans (\u00a36.00). This is gutsy Mexican food. It tastes both fresh and interesting. And (tip to other burritos I've tried recently) it's not overloaded with refried beans to the point of saturation of all other flavours. Benito's Hat opened its new outlet in Covent Garden on 16th July, an offshoot of its popular Goodge St restaurant. The decor in Covent Garden is different - quite stark and white, with splashes of green and red, it doesn't encourage lingering. It screams fast food (despite the careful, slow cooking involved). But chef Felipe Fuentes Cruz concedes this, and admits the team are already considering changes to soften some of the edges and encourage their patrons to linger with that extra margarita or dessert. You get the idea they're flexible enough to make whatever changes are required to satisfy their customers - some Goodge St customers have commented that the food tastes different, which Felipe puts down to the different, more modern equipment being used in the new kitchen. If the new stuff doesn't work out, they'll revert back to the same equipment as in the original store. It seems to be working out to me... Named after Benito Juarez, a former Mexican president with a penchant for a certain distinctive wide-brimmed hat, Benito's Hat is the enterprise of Ben Fordham (ex-lawyer who has honed his culinary skills in Mexico) and head chef Felipe (formerly of other London Mexican restaurants like Green & Red). Felipe, hailing from Puebla in Mexico, is happy to chat with patrons as he works the floor and the cash register, and his passion - devoid of any ego - is obvious. The aim here is to bring the vibrant flavours and colours of Mexico's rich culinary culture to Londoners who are over the bland Tex-Mex scene. The flavours are simple and fresh. And, for once, the pork burrito tastes and smells distinctly different from the beef one. There are tacos, salads and soups as well. We start with a couple of margaritas - classic for me (\u00a35) and watermelon for TPG (\u00a36.00). Made with 100% Pure Blue Agave tequila (no mixers) they're excellent. We accompany them with some light and crispy tortilla chips with a terrific guacamole - chunky fresh avocado, with the zing of lime and the bite of summery tomatoes. We also try some tacos with 2 types of chicken - Ben's chargrilled chicken breast, marinated overnight in chipotle chillies, cumin and cinnamon, and Felipe's braised chicken breast version cooked in a blend of achiote (the seeds are ground and used as a mildly flavoured colouring agent in Mexican cooking), tomato and guajillo chillies (\u00a34 for two). They come in soft flour tortillas with the recommended lettuce, cheese and salsa (although you can add other toppings). Alone they would be a much smaller meal than the burritos, and together with a burrito, it's all way too much. But we battle on in the line of duty... Felipe's braised chicken is particularly good (again, so tender) but the tacos are less interesting, less meaty - I'm afraid they don't compete with the magnificent burritos so I take a couple of bites and decide not to waste rapidly diminishing stomach space. And then, although we can't believe we're doing it, we have dessert. By this point our chairs are creaking, on which grounds we steer away from heavier options like the tres leches cake and go for a ball of dulce de leche ice-cream, sprinkled with cinnamon and surrounded with a higgledy piggledy array of buneulos (strips of fried flour tortillas) liberally sprinkled in sugar and cinnamon (\u00a33.50). Presentation could be improved, and while I didn't adore the bunuelos I devoured them in a way you wolf down the empty calories of a packet of Doritos after a big night on the town - in that wasteful, dirty, mindless sort of way. The ice-cream was",

    "text": "I found myself on the Southbank around lunch time on Saturday with a strong desire for the tacos. My number one choice in this area Tortilla was closed so I hiked on into town and made my way to Benito's Hat which is situated just off Covent Garden. It was pretty quiet for a Saturday lunchtime with no queue and plenty of tables available. Like most of these \"Mexican\" burrito places the menu and instructions for ordering are on the wall which makes the whole thing very easy if you are not familiar with the concept. It's a nice room, bright and light with a functional layout. Take your choice of sitting at a regular table or there is a long counter with high stools which is probably best for singles or couples. It's not designed for a long, lingering lunch particularly during a busy mid-week lunch time but it's well designed and is pleasant enough. As there were only a few other diners I grabbed a table so I could spread out with my food, beer and newspaper. The menu itself is pretty much the same as you will find at all the other main players in this area of \"fast\" food (think Tortilla, Burrito Bros, etc). Burritos, tacos and salads were all on offer with all the fillings we know and love, present and correct. I had a couple of the flour tacos with the pork; layered up with shredded lettuce, cheese, sour cream and topped off with some hot, hot sauce. Side order of guacamole, chips and a bottle of Modelo Especial and this fella was ready to chow down. It was a fine taco but just a little too \"sloppy\", a small puddle of juice collected in the bottom of my foil wrapping, to be perfect for my taste. It's a fine line between moist and wet but nonetheless it was a pretty good lunch. The guacamole was as fresh as you like with a great zing to it and the chips were crispy and crunchy with no hint of grease. My beer was a spot on accompaniment to the tacos and there are a few other brands available. A range of cocktails and tequila can also be had and the special 2 for 1 offer on the cocktails in the early evening would make this a bargain way to kick off a night in central London. The staff are very friendly and efficient; more than happy to indulge in a bit of banter when things are quiet and they are keen to get your feedback. It's a good cheap fast dining experience, with quality ingredients well cooked, at Benito's Hat. Perhaps not as good as the Fitzrovia branch but still pretty damn fine. If I could award a \u00a0star this would be getting 3 . So I left well fed, a smile on my face and a spring in my step as I crossed Waterloo Bridge to check out the free lunchtime music being provided by the wicked Cuban combo, the Sugar Kings, at the National Theatre (a free London top tip if you are visiting our great city).",

Braised chicken/beef, grilled chicken, pulled pork or marinated vege all look delicious. Hard to choose which to go for. And what better way to wash down a burrito than with a margarita!? Happy hour 5-7 daily",

    "text": "A nice little place to go if you're wanting to grab a casual lunch that's super filling, quite healthy and not too expensive. I had the chicken burrito with refried beans. The portion was plenty, and they throw in a few complimentary salted nachos too. For this and a can of Coke I think the damage was around \u00a37.50. The burrito was pretty good, but I also think there's probably better out there and I'd like to try a few other places, but wouldn't be adverse to coming back to Burrito's Hat. The service is efficient and friendly and the surroundings are clean and casual. A good alternative to the Prets/Eats/McDonalds that dominate the surrounding area for pretty much the same price.",

After having lived in California, I couldn't expect Mexican food in England to even come close. \u00a0After a middling, expensive meal at Taqueria in Notting Hill, my suspicions were set to be confirmed, but Benitos Hat quickly reversed that and turned it on its' head. \u00a0My braised pork (they didn't call it Carnitas!?) burrito was a perfect blend of all your favorite ingredients smashing into each other and creating that warm meaty gooey mash that makes it so perfect. \u00a0The size, roughly the shape and weight of what I imagine my stomach must be, was about right, although I might complain it was a little too round and not long enough for easy consumption, although one might also argue half the fun in a burrito is taming it into your mouth. \u00a0Not only that, my burrito was a decent price, unlike the (lackluster) Chipotles here.My companions similarily enjoyed their meals, and washed it down with Pacificos, Negra Modellos, and margaritas (the latter I can 't attest to, being a beer man). \u00a0 However, I will have to subtract a point for the sparse and slightly garish fast food environment.. other than itty potted cactii on the tables, it conveyed little character, as even dingy hole-in-the-wall burrito joints back West manage to do.",

Once was for a tasting session and the other was for lunch the other day. I think I'm actually going off burritos. Either that or I haven't had a really good one in ages. I have sampled a lot of what comes out the kitchen at Bento's Hat and I have to say, a lot of it is pretty darn tasty. Lunchtime burritos whoever, not so much. For one, I've never witnessed someone having so much trouble rolling and wrapping the damn thing. Also, the whole process was so slow I almost wanted to jump over there and help the poor girl.It was also a little odd that non of the tables had hot sauce on them, and when I asked for some they put some salsa in a small pot and gave that to me. Very strange. However, when I was here during the evening the cocktails and nibbles were delightful so I think I might have just got an off day.",

I don't like picking favourites, but on this occasion I'll admit it - it was the best burrito I'd ever had.

I then huffed when the lady tried to swizzle me out of some sliced chillis-she looked at me and shook her head like I had just taken a selfie on train tracks. The thing is I love chillis and it's not just about heat, as habanero is sweet tasting-once your taste buds come back! Anyway, the burrito was lovely. Here, they throw in the tortilla chips for free. Now, you can go to Chipotle round the corner and there is a plethora of harsh stainless steel and hard chairs which screams-\"eat your burrito and leave\" whereas-for the same price-Benitos provides a much more relaxed and pleasant environment where you can sit and sip a margarita at leisure. The product is the same in both but I have a continued soft spot for Benito and his head appendage.",

And so I did...and was sadly not so impressed. The tortilla was a little old and so fell apart as I was eating my tacos, all a little messy. Luckily I was dining alone, you would not want this happening in date situation! The fillings and sauces were nothing particularly special and I think the whole thing should have cost a couple of quid less. What a shame! I'll definitely give it another go as I was really taken with the food at the yelp event. Maybe they were just having an off evening, I hope so! A regretful Meh..c*",

    "text": "This is far and away my favourite burrito place in West London, and currently in London altogether. There are other good burrito places, but what make Benito's Hat stand out is the ingredients.I work nearby, so we walk over fairly often. They change what they have on offer. Unlike Chipotle or Tortilla (both fine in their own ways), Benito's hat changes things up from time to time. I've had spicy tofu, spicy mushrooms, and different kinds of vegetables. They also have my favourite Mexican beer (Negra Modelo) and they serve it with a lime (just like they do in the US). It's also nice to get a few tortilla chips thrown in when you get a burrito. We usually munch on those during our walk back to the office.",

    "text": "Not too long ago, I wrote a review of Benito's Hat and, overall, I wasn't very impressed.Last night, after grabbing some cheap last-minute tickets to the theatre (yay!), we had 40 minutes to grab something to eat and get back. Benito's Hat it is, my partner said, even though we'd been less that thrilled last time.We changed up our strategy this time, however, after noticing that perhaps tacos weren't the way to go. We both opted for burritos (his pork and refried beans, mine spicy chicken and black beans), and this time we came away happier. It didn't seem like they were putting much in when they were building it but it ended up being tasty, quick, and relatively cheap.I still take exception to the fact that they charge \u00a30.70 for guacamole. Maybe I'm cheap but I don't consider guacamole 'extra' on a burrito but rather standard so I don't think there should be a charge.Other than that, Benito's is back in my good graces. I wouldn't make a special trip for it but I'm more likely to consider it now when I'm in the area.",

    "text": "I went to ask if they had a restroom so I could wash my hands after coming off the tube, and the first man I spoke to said there was no toilet. I thought it was a bit strange, but I just went with it. I got two chicken tacos, one grilled and one braised, with mild and hot salsa and sour cream with a side of guac. The hot salsa is not hot, but more medium. The medium salsa was delicious, though not medium. The guacamole was pretty good, but it was missing some salt or lime juice. I was overall pleased with the ambiance and experience, as I was just hungry and looking for a quick bite. There was a sink at the end of the counter and I asked if I could wash my hands, to which a different person told me there was a sink and toilet downstairs. So strange. I'm not sure what happened there. I'd go back in a pinch, as the food was good, but it wasn't on any must try list for me.",

    "text": "I used to think this was the best burrito in town.A year and a few months later, it's not. It's really not. Benito's, sadly, has gone down hill and you can find loads of better options.The insides, which used to be fresh and flavourful, are now tired and bland at best. Meat is dry and the refried beans have turned into disgusting greasy brown sludge that no sane human would eat.They give you much less, as well, and I ended up with a very skinny burrito.Service is quite a bit less friendly than in the past.I won't return.",
