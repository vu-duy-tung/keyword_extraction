Prompt service, small space but never crowded. The decor is simple and elegant. We've always been seated right away and the food comes out quickly. We're in and out of there in no time. And the prices are reasonable. They bring out a bowl of fish flavored pork rinds before the meal (a little fishy for my taste!), and at the end the bring some mints with the check. We first tried this place after checking yelp for high rated thai places near our flat in South Kensington. We far prefer Thai Taste to Thai Square down the road. Thai Taste has better food and better service.",

I liked it so much I went back and had the same meal tonight... Here's the price rundown:1 CUP Tom yum soup (with 4 large shrimp) 5.951 single portion mussaman chicken 9.951 scoop steamed rice (NOT jasmine) 2.201 glass diet coke 2.50So that totals \u00a320.60 and they add a service charge of \u00a32.58\u00a323.18 is steep for a Thai dinner for 1.No leftovers.$36.00 It was delicious. Deeeee-licous!!!The flavor of the Tom yum was not 100% authentic but it was really great. The rice is standard steamed white... Why does it cost extra?????The chicken in the curry and the actual curry gravy was so damn good it was all I could do to refrain from licking the bowl. Dammnnnnnn good!But still, restaurants are expensive here in London and I guess it was good enough to be a good experience. I would have been pissed if the food was not so good.I really want to go again tomorrow but I just can't expense such an expensive meal again. If the prices don't freak you out, give it a go.It's a nice little space but not really fancy or anything... Just a typical modern space.Lots of good food in London, for sure... Have fun!",

We had just come back from Thailand no less than 3 months ago for our honeymoon so I was a bit skeptical. Low and behold a pretty awesome and tasty Panang curry! It was great. I seriously ate that plate of curry like it was my last meal. And for such a swanky looking place it was the best prices on the row of restaurants. go figure. I'll probably be going back tonight actually. That good!",

They made up a table in loft area in back - very lovely. We had our 9 and 12 year olds with us. We skipped appetizer and went straight for dinner. My husband saw a dish pass by that was too hot for another customer - stopped to find out what it was - it was on the chefs recommendation page with green curry. He ordered that. We also had panang curry, sweet and sour chicken and pad see ew. The pad see ew was the best we had ever had and our daughter always orders it. It was delicious! The panang and sweet/sour did not disappoint and the green curry was scrumptious with some heat. We ordered additional coconut rice because everyone chowed down on their own plates and ate off each other's. There was not a bit left. Quite possibly our best meal all trip! What a wonderful spot to eat and chic place to socialize. We will definitely be back this week!!",

I had a fantastic meal at this surprisingly intimate restaurant. I started with an order of the chicken satay. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the peanut sauce on the side was awesome. I ordered the \"Weeping Tiger\" special -- grilled sirloin steak with tamarind and a plum sugar sauce -- as my entree. Again, the meat was cooked to perfection. Something in the sauce didn't really agree with me -- still not sure what it was -- but the whole meal was still great.I'm a big tea buff, so I was absolutely smitten with their lemongrass tea. I drank an entire pot on my own, and probably could've ordered a second one had I not pulled myself away from the table. Definitely a winner.",

I didn't have a reservation and they were rather busy for a Wednesday evening. Think 70's Lounge with dim mood lighting, that's what it looked like but it was actually kind of cozy and although not as upscale as the upstairs dining room it didn't detract from the meal.The black pepper calamari was excellent, really excellent and a good portion. The accompanying jasmine rice was a nice side. However, I wouldn't order the appetizer of dim sim again. It was a bit bland and lacked spice or salt. Service was friendly and efficient.Overall, this was definitely a \"visit again\" type of restaurant. Reservations suggested.",

We went back the day after (and the day after that prior to departing home) and had 2 more meals here. Everything was so friggen tasty - definitely one of the best thai meals we've ever had. \u00a0Even the Lemongrass Tea that my sister ordered was incredible - oozing with and infused with a pure, aromatic, strong lemongrass flavour (we were told the tea was imported from Thailand). You bet we'll be back next time we're in London! Only downside: the portions are tinier than usual.P.S Their coconut rice is to-die-for!!",

I came in here on accident, my intent was to visit the Italian restaurant next door, when I saw that it was empty I quickly jumped on yelp in hopes for an explanation and sure enough the one and a half star was all I needed to walk away. The next closest place was Thai taste and in this sort of cold, I did not want to walk another block. The place is small but the tables were just about all taken, good sign that nudged me into checking it out but it was pure laziness (or fate) that was the deciding factor and made me walk in to get some food in my belly and to thaw out my toes. I was quickly greeted by a man who was clearly not Thai but had a smile that said otherwise. I was seated and menus brought to me immediately. I like that they had a wine list as well, although it was a short wine list, it had a nice selection. I went easy and ordered the chicken fried rice and the chicken and ginger- Basil (sorry these were called something else on the menu but that was the description). I know I played it safe on my selection but if they can't do simple dishes like that right then they certainly couldn't handle much else. \u00a0Here's where I would throw in a bunch of superlative's but I won't and I'll just say that the food was outstanding, so much that I text the beastie who was in another country just to say so and fish for a reaction to what surely would be disbelief on his part. Wonderful staff,Great service, warm smile's and fantastic, fresh, perfectly prepared food. I still wouldn't call myself a Thai food fan but again, I am a fan of Thai Taste. Well done!",

    "text": "I stayed nearby at the Marriott and ate here daily. \u00a0Dinner was crowded but service was attentive and polite. Lunch was quiet with quick service. \u00a0Always with a smile. \u00a0The food is fresh, delicious, and portions are relatively generous. \u00a0The dim sum starter is great. There are four shiu Mai dumplings with roasted garlic on top. \u00a0The spring rolls were just ok. \u00a0The tom young soup was good but expensive for a small portion. \u00a0The mains consisted of the soft shell curry crab. \u00a0A must try!!!! \u00a0The steamed sea bass was perfect. \u00a0Light and fresh with hints of lemongrass and citrus. \u00a0I would come back in a minute.",
