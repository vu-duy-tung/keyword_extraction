(I didnt eat chinese until last year! And still havent worked up to Indian yet lol) But this was a lovely meal. The waiters are so helpful, they even chucked in free drinks and other dishes etc because we had spent so much, and my friend was a regular. The food was very nice, although i was a bit scared to try it, it all tasted gorgeous and definatly worth going back, I was expecting the price to be very OTT as the restaurant was very well presented and in a great location in London, but i was so shocked by how cheap it was! A great night out, would definatly recommend.",

Diners can sit by the high dining tables observing the chefs grilling and cooking in style or can sit on the 1st floor (cover charge applies) or on the ground floor for a more relaxed environment. Prices are very reasonable for the surrounding Knightsbridge/South Kensington area and the grilled meat is simply brilliant. Try the Lahem Mashwi (grilled lamb) or chicken livers for a rather unusual set of dishes.",

I would strongly recommend the kalawi (lamb kidneys) and the standard meat kebab dishes. \u00a0The service was good, and we received generous help in selecting our dishes.-1 star for the service time.

I cannot say I was so overwhelmed that I would queue to get in again and recommend this place to all my friends, but at least the amount of food was very copious indeed. The humous was also quite good, though I was not too fond of the overcooked sujuk (lamb sausage). We ate in the covered terrace, which looks and feels like a cheap suburban converted greenhouse so the ambience was not too wonderful. Service was quite OK, though they hit us for cover charges of \u00a38 (for no reason that I can think of). The Middle Eastern music was competing with some bar disco noise thumping up from downstairs or next door, so it wasn't the most harmonious of evenings. Still, if one wants to be thoroughly fed, then this place fits the bill, especially with the menu for two.",

I remember many a nice evening in those places, although the atmosphere and service are still there I just think the food is missing the passion it had before. Last time I went in I had the Lamb Shawarma, which although was spiced correctly was very fatty and this gets worse if you allow it cool down. The mezes are a bit commercial also, you pay a bit over the odds to eat here and yet it's not the best anymore. There are other tastier and cheaper alternatives on edgeware road, as anybody who goes there knows it's full of lebanese and middle eastern resturants so there is a lot of choice. I just think they might end down sizing in the number of outlets they have in the near future because in this market and with the knock on effect of the credit crunch only the best places will survive in the short to medium term.",

We both loved the food. At the end of the meal we were given a large plate of fruit and some small sweet breads. We thought that was a great touch to a fabulous dinner. SURPRISE! There was a 2\u00a3 cover charge for each of us. We didn't notice if this was announced anywhere before but if so, we hadn't noticed it. We just deducted it from the tip and in all fairness, the fruit and desert would probably have cost that much. The dining area is spacious and we had a nice seat by the window where we could see the street.There is a dining room downstairs that serves the same food with no cover charge.... And perhaps they don't give you the little extra at the end either. I'm going to try to get back and find out, the food is great!There is also a nice looking bakery attached.",

It is a buzz on the first floor where people are eating at the bar, or if you want to relax and talk head upstairs for dining. This is a great place for heading out for amazing food in the wee hours of the night. I think we were there at 2 am and had fresh, well prepared food upstairs in the dining room. That they are still on the ball at 2 or 3 am is amazing considering that most of the clients at this point have had a few too many cocktails. We had the hummus, two lamb plates (schwarma and cubed lamb) and we hung out talking after that for quite a bit of time drinking spring water. It was the perfect place to sober up before walking around the block. Great night spot for simple fresh Mediterranean food!",

Maroush gets it done right.TABBOULEHThey use flat leaf instead of curly leaf parsley, which makes a big difference as flat leaf has a stronger flavor profile.LAMB SHAWARMASometimes I find lamb to be a bit too gamey for my taste. I'm not sure what they do here, but I found their lamb to be fantastic.

    "text": "Lebanese food. It doesn't come to mind as one of my favorite places to eat but now I may have to rethink that after a visit to Maroush. It was late to eat in London (11pm) and most of the places around my hotel were no longer serving food. A bartender at a nearby pub suggested Maroush which we grabbed at. We walked in and were directed to the restaurant side of the place (one side is for counter service and take out) where we were seated immediately.We began to peruse the menu. Now having never had Lebanese food- and with my colleague a bit of a picky eater (it was all I could do to get her to sit and stay for the meal) I knew I was going to have to be smart in my choices as she deferred the ordering to me. \u00a0We started with hummus and some type of grilled cheese served with tomatoes and cucumbers. \u00a0Our server also brought us a couple of Lebanese beers which were quite good. I began to see a smile on my colleague's face. So far so good. Then on to the entrees. I went with the lamb and chicken combo (sort of like shish kabobs) seasoned with some great (but unknown) spices and served with what I think was yogurt and some kind of spicy sauce, while she had grilled chicken. We also had a side of the rice. Quite good all the way around. The food came up quickly and was devoured just as quickly. Our server was very helpful- pointing out things on the menu that she liked and showing us how we might want to put the various sauces and foods together. She also brought out some complimentary Lebanese desserts which were the perfect, sweet way to end our evening. The manager told me that this place does most of it's business between 11pm and 3am as it is one of the places that stays open for when the clubs in the area close down . Reasonable prices too! I knew the evening meal had been a success when I heard my colleague praising it to others the next day. A good night for a couple of Lebanese food newbies!",

Amazing. Delicious hummus, fantastic kibbe nayeh (raw lamb with onions and herbs), and good chicken shawarma (an extra tomato or two could lift that to a higher level). Hummus was balanced, flavorful, just the right amount of spice to make it interesting, and the right amount of oil to make it oh so good. The kibbe nayeh was a new experience, and definitely worth it. Up there with the best steak tartare, this was finely chopped, almost purreed, and nearly melted in your mouth, tasting nothing like the lamb I had ever had before. Delicately spiced, and with an incredibly unique taste that's hard to pin down after only one try.Nothing very fancy about it, just a really wonderful little sit down place, surrounded by fascinating Middle Eastern families discussing their weddings, truant sons, and princess daughters. Quick service, excellent food, and yes, a rolls Royce or two waiting outside. But for us, our bicycles.We will absolutely be back, even if it means braving the night-time hordes that turn Brompton Street into little Dubai.",

At first glance, the decor seemed too minimalist and the atmosphere lacked the festivity of a restaurant withing walking distance of a major shopping Mecca. However, after we happily tucked in our sprawling lunch spread, we rather enjoyed Maroush. We ordered hummus and salad to start. It was easily one of the most perfect bowls of hummus I have ever had in my life. Then we ordered chicken shawarma, lamb cubes (though \"cubes\" certainly don't sound enticing) in curry, and falafel. The chicken shawarma was tasty, but the lamb cubes and falafel were definitely more remarkable. The lamb had the ideal tenderness, tearing apart perfectly and playing well with its tomatoey curry. The falafel, toasty with a nice tinge of spice, was excellent. Also, we all had their fresh lemonade with everything, which I highly recommend as well.I would definitely recommend Maroush if you're craving a little meaty, tangy Mediterranean goodness mid-shopping session!",

While our entire experience wasn't the best because of a large family that came into dine, we made the best of it. Given some of the issues trying to put a family in a room that we were dining in, the servers realized the issue, put us in a different room and made our experience more than anything we would have ever asked for due to the issues. We just wanted to sit in a different room because of the obnoxious family. There was about 15 of them, so I'll let you think of what we went through.The staff is amazing from start to finish. Very friendly individuals, all of them. The location is very convenient being close to Harrods and in a very boutiquey shopping area. I ordered Shish Tawok and it was supurb. The flavor was incredible. My partner ordered the Chicken Shawerma and was also very impressed with the flavor. We both expected that our orders would be over a bed of rice, but it didn't matter. It was delicious. Given the mixup with the family the staff went out of their way to make sure we were happy. They brought us a fruit tray, which normally I don't eat fruit, but this was definitely the best fruit we've ever tasted. Very fresh. It was almost like it wasn't real because of how fresh and delicious it was. They then brought us out ice cream, which was also some of the best homemade ice cream we've ever had. Lastly, to cap it off they brought us mint tea. I have to say, for staff trying to ensure the rest of our experience was perfect, they didn't an amazing job. They went way out of their way. Because of this, we will be back soon. What a great place. I highly recommend it to those who love middle eastern food.",

The fresh mango juice is to die for as is the garlic sauce, not as good as the garlic sauce as Zankou in Los Angeles but it comes quite close to it. Chicken was really good and moist , pita was warm fresh & fluffy like the pictures others have uploaded. My only criticism would be the potatoes, these could've been a bit spicier & tangier but that's no fault of the restaurant as my palate is a bit skewed.",

There are certainly some bizarre aspects to this restaurant, such as the giant bowl of uncut veggies sitting on the table when you arrive, but we saw other people digging in so we did the same! We tried a little bit of almost everything on the menu, but the Hommos Shawarma, Kibbeh, Fattet Hommos B'laban, and Mixed Grill were table favorites. The pita bread was also very fresh and toasty, and the waiters kept our bread plates full. After the meal we were served a corresponding plate of uncut fresh fruit and some little pastries, which were delightful. A must try if you are in the area and craving good Lebanese food.",

Definitely order: - hummus (or hommos)  - the spicy Lebanese salad (or Marroush salad if you don't like spicy) - shish taouk - amazingly tender chicken skewers served with garlic sauce  - lamb shawarma - enough said - kafta khosh-khash - minced lamb skewers with amazing sauce and onionsI wish I had more room to try more because I'm sure you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. \u00a0They also give you a plate of complimentary fruit and dessert when you finish. Tip: \u00a0definitely order dishes to share (family style)",

We got the hummus with lamb and the chicken liver wrap to start. The hummus came with sliced grilled lamb on top and was delicious. The chicken liver was wrapped in bread with a yogurt sauce, tomatoes and pickles. It was cooked to a great texture. The main dish we ordered was the lamb roast with a side of haluomi cheese. The lamb roast is a good portion lamb leg with heavily spiced rice, topped with roasted pine nuts. The cheese was grilled so it had an interesting texture. It was served with tomato slices and cucumber slices. This was our first time having Lebanese food and I've got to say Maroush's got us hooked! The service was great as well, even though there were only three waitresses they managed to take care of the entire restaurant.",

It was very unclear where to go and what food was served in each location. We went upstairs to the restaurant - but then got sent downstairs to wait with the take out section. There wasn't really anywhere to wait other than right by the kitchen where there were dirty plates and food leftovers. Eventually we were led back up to the restaurant level and sat in what appeared to be an old conservatory. The service was very lacking. That being said, the food was pretty decent.Lamb Soujok - Spicy sausage served in an acidic sauce. Very niceBammieh B'zeit - Cold Okra in tomato sauce. Very Good!Spicy hummus and pita - No complaints. The waitress brought a second round of pita while we were eating.Falafel - Very moist and flavorful. This was a highlight of the meal.

    "text": "Hands down, the best Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food I've ever had and I've been to countless number of them. I give it five star for food, not service. \u00a0In my American mind and expectations, it was absolutely ridiculous to ask three different waiters for a glass of water and get nothing until the fourth one brought some. \u00a0BUT, that's the case pretty much everywhere we've eaten in London. So, it might be a cultural difference between the UK and US to offer water/drink as soon as the customers sit down and offer refills.",

This place was a godsend. \u00a0The food was beyond good. \u00a0It's not easy to make hummus and tabouleh memorable, but theirs was so tasty we want to come back again. \u00a0And this is in London, where by rights we should try more places!!!The green beans and lamb daily special was perfectly seasoned and textured. \u00a0The dessert was \"just\" a fruit plate and baklava. \u00a0It was \"just\" perfectly ripe apples, pears, oranges, grapes, and honeydew melon. \u00a0As a baklava fan, I can swear this is some of the best I've ever ever eaten. \u00a0Without a doubt, hands down, the best Lebanese food I have ever had the joy of eating.",

The kababs were tender and tasty. Service for the most part was sadly lacking. But one of the wait staff made up for it by being very friendly, actually smiling and asking us about our food. The unexpected complimentary dessert (baklava and fresh fruit) was a pleasant surprise. We asked for the leftovers to be packed and they packed fresh pita bread. Recommended for the food not the service.",

There was enough food for a second full meal! Authentic, quality Lebanese food. Loved the mint pudding with rose water and crushed pistachios. I'll dream of that pudding for years to come.",

There's not much room for groups, but sitting at the counter and watching the cooks prepare the food was fun. The falafel was very tasty, and it's great to switch your regular pizza for a Lebanese one every one in a while - it won't lose at taste.",
