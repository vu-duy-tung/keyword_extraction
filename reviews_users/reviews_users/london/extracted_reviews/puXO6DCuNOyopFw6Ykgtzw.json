It's small, dingy, , tables are packed very close together and at busy times you will have spare places at your table filled by other customers (a bit like Wong Kei's- the famous Chinese near Gerrard St). The place was crowded, and the waitresses abrupt. In the end I ordered pad thai (my benchmark dish for Thai food). Service was fast, food good and the locals clearly frequent it. Instead of Thai you can have sandwiches and some very dangerous looking fry-ups. According to the signs they only serve Thai after 6pm and you can bring alcohol with a \u00a31 per person corkage. Definitely not a place to impress a new client/ date, but a super no nonsense greasy spoon with the added bonus of serving Thai!",

I really can't understand what the other commentators mean when they say the portions are too small, spoiled by unnecessarily large platefuls elsewhere, perhaps. Size isn't everything, after all, and what Marie's serves is fantastic quality over super size me quantity.It's absolutely ideal for grabbing a meal before a visit to the Old Vic. Fast service, tons of atmosphere, stonkingly fresh food, and the best Tom Kah Gai for miles around. No license so bring your own bottle with \u00a31 per person corkage.On last night's trip, four of us got through four starters and five mains between us for just over \u00a340 and every mouthful was delicious.Cheap, cheerful, and heartily recommended.",

    "text": "I last tried this place about five years ago but didn't have a good experience. At that time I had an English breakfast whose beans were overcooked (mushy and congealed) and whose sausages were hard and needed sawing through. I was a bit bewildered a year or two ago to see it listed in something like London's Best Caf\u00e9s or The Best 50 Caf\u00e9s in Britain. In view of today's other reviews, I decided to give it another go. So today I again had their English breakfast, and this time it was a whole lot better. I had their no. 7 breakfast: sausage, two bacon, two fried eggs, black pudding, two slices of bread and a mug of tea. Pretty well all of it was quite competently done (the tea was slightly stewed but drinkable). I was pleased that they got the black pudding right as so often it's overcooked and dry. The clientele seems to be a mixture of Guardian readers, building workers and office workers (though these categories can of course overlap: I'm two of the three). The staff are competent (though a bit uncommunicative) and they were prompt in taking the order, serving the meal and taking payment. The caf\u00e9 could do with a bit of a clean, but otherwise it looks fine - I do like the unpretentiousness of the place. At \u00a34 it was very good value, so I'll probably pop in again to try their Thai menu.",

Old posters of Thailand on old walls, stuff wearing oldschool aprons and everything served on white plates. The place was full both time I came, you can bring your own wine (dry white goes amazingly way with Thai dishes) and just enjoy the atmosphere. There is something really nostalgic about the Thai stuff, who look (age wise) like family members - extremely friendly. It smells amazing, everything is fresh (had oysters once as well), and the portions are much bigger than anywhere else I have eaten in London. Fabulous green thai curry, probably better than anywhere else around here, reminded me of something far far away from rainy London - of my home, although it happened to be in Eastern Europe. Brought my friends there, and we were eating for hours. Nobody complained, just the opposite, it seemed like they loved us being in there. Absolutely great beginning of the evening.",

As a previous Qyper mentions, it's the best place in the area and if you have a bit of spare time whilst waiting for a train, it's certainly worth walking the short distance from the station for great Thai food at a reasonable price. Having brought friends that have extensively travelled Thailand there, I'm also reliably informed that it's some of the most authentic Thai food that you can find in London which is a plus. It's also great in the evenings and would make a perfect place to dine before visiting the southbank or any of the local theatres. I really can't find fault with Maries.",

Even better, it is *great* value - mains are towards the lower end of the \u00a35-7 range - about as low as you can get in central London, and service is fast, brusque and friendly in charming London-by-way-of-Thailand accents. BYOB. I had an excellently satisfying tom kha hed (mushroom and coconut milk soup) and a good phad see-u (fat rice noodles sauteed with vegetables and soy sauce). My dining companions had similarly good soups and one had good-looking banana fritters for dessert and even the accompanying ice cream looked authentically Thai (a very yellow vanilla). The only false notes were an oddly un-minced phad prik bai krapao - mince with chili & Thai basil \u00a0(but we may have ordered wrong) and being offered Lipton tea when we asked for Thai iced tea, but maybe they just didn't have it.You may need to wait for a table as the place seems continually packed, but just go have a drink in the Cuban restaurant nearby and by the time you're done your table will be ready. I think you can actually book, which seems at odds with the no-frills decor. Anyone know who Marie is, btw?",

But then you notice the crowds in the evening and check the menu to find home-style Thai food at superb prices (currys just north of 5 pounds). To be sure, I've had better Thai food, but not at these low prices and I really liked the homely atmosphere... I get the impression that the owners decided to run a caf and while they serve the usual English fare in the mornings and afternoons, experimented by serving tried and tested home recipes in the evenings. When it comes to restaurants, the wisdom of the crowds often applies and it can be tough to find a table here in this packed restaurant on Saturday nights. BYOB is a nice touch too.",

It is a great idea to ordered other items on the menu for a low price but definitely not chicken noodles with soup.",

I also had had pad Thai, Tom yum soup, squid with ginger sauce, satay chicken skewer. The squid had ginger strips and if you eat them then it's spicy. I didn't enjoy that part. Tom yum was more on the sour side which is what I prefer. They only take cash.",

It was just what we needed for a chilly spring evening in London. \u00a0Marie's is an unassuming place with some dishes that really rock.To start we shared the vegetable spring rolls, the shrimp crackers, the tempura battered prawns, the chicken dim sum and also tried one of their soups, I forget the name, maybe the tom kha hed. \u00a0 \u00a0The appetizers were alright but not the best dishes at the place. \u00a0The soup we all agreed was too lemony and salty.For mains we ordered the prawn panang curry, the basil chili fish, the green curry beef and pad thai. Wow, the panang curry was really really yummy. The sauce was rich and thick and had the perfect spice kick to it. We had to reorder to satiate our taste buds. I also really enjoyed the basil chili fish. I had been craving a crispy fish dish and this just did the trick. They really knew how to work the flavours of the sauce with the crispy texture. \u00a0 The green curry beef I was not a fan of. \u00a0The beef was too tough and the curry sauce was a bit watery. \u00a0The pad thai was quite good. Marie's is definitely worth checking out. I personally will be coming back here frequently for the panang curry, pad thai and basil chilli fish... it will be feasible because the prices are also very low ; )",
