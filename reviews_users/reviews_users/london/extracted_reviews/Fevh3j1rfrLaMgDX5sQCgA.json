The menu is also usually split between a pub lunch menu and a full restaurant menu. The food is good, but nothing spectacular and the service is sometimes a little slack.",

    "text": "The laughing gravy is a superb little restaurant on Blackfriars Road. Friendly, homely and exceedingly tasty, we were surprised how good it was. Despite not having a booking, we were seated quickly on a Friday evening (there was a brief check, even though the restaurant was empty!) but after that the experience was flawless. The waiting staff are friendly and attentive, and happy to chat about the food and drinks menu. The selection is very good, and they clearly take a lot of pride in their food. Our duck starter with caramel was exceptional, and the mains were excellent. My steak was tender and delicious and my wife's vegetable hash was of similar quality. The mains do vary in price, so it's suitable for less extravagant occasions as well \u00a0you can have a burger for ~\u00a310, or rump / sirloin steak for \u00a318-22. The drinks menu is also very good \u00a0the wine is a shade expensive, but there's a very good selection of beers and ales as well (including that from very local, very good Kernel Brewery) It's not dressy, and we went in straight after work \u00a0there are people there in jeans and t-shirts, as well as suits. All in all, it feels very relaxed, but there's a kind of relaxed pride in the quality of service and food there. It's not too expensive for what it is \u00a0two glasses of wine, a beer, one starter (shared) and two mains (and service) came to \u00a366. For the kind of quality you'd expect in somewhere twice the price, this is a real find.",

We shared a starter of fois gras and caramelised hazelnuts, which were looking pretty with their edible flower decorations and sweetly glazed.There were 2 fish dishes calling out and I decided for the roast monkfish. Nicely presented in a composition of fish, seafood, rice and vegetables, I fell in love with this dish. My mum went for the roast vegetables with Somerset Brie and was very content too. We also had desserts: light, sweet, fruit sorbets and warm peach crumble with vanilla ice-cream, all very good.Drinks and wine list also looked interesting and the staff could make recommendations according to our taste.All in all, we were very lucky to come across the Laughing Gravy... what a nice, unplanned discovery!",

Wellington can be a difficult dish to cook since it's not easy to get the puff pastry just right, but Laughing Gravy nailed it! The creamy, mocha-chocolatey sauce underneath it was sinfully good.

We thought, fine, let's go across the street, have a few beers, explore the neighborhood options and if all else fails, go back because, hey the kitchen stays open until 00:00. So around 21:45 my mate goes in and asks for a table of three if it's not too late - clearly there was room to seat us. Unfortunately, the staffer said \"yes, unfortunately it's too late to seat anyone.\" We were told it'd be an hour wait, so that's what we did - and still, we were refused service. Completely unacceptable. Not only to refuse the business from three hungry lads, but also the fact \u00a0we'd already shown ourselves once before and expressed interest in eating - leaves an awful impression. Won't be back.",

    "text": "I was determined that I'd have some type of wellington in London while I was there. \u00a0So I resorted to Yelp and found this little cute place a few metro stations away from us. \u00a0Service was great. \u00a0Food was delicious. \u00a0I must say, though, I felt little stupid about my mild obsession about having wellington in London. \u00a0It was nothing special. \u00a0It tasted like eating a good piece of steak with a pot pie crust. \u00a0Gordon Ramsey's Hell's Kitchen must have made my expectation too high for this particular dish. \u00a0They did have amazing Mac N Cheese. \u00a0My bf who'd pick mac and cheese as one of this top comfort food said Laughing Gravy's one is one of his favorites. \u00a0I think that says a lot.The place is pricey (but I guess 3 pound sigh tells you that). \u00a0For two dishes plus a desert to share, one glass of wine, one cocktail came out to over 73 pounds (and at this time the exchange rate is about 1.56). And I didn't know that in England they add on \"optional\" 12.5% service charge to the bill. \u00a0I thought in European countries the price you see on the menu already reflects the service charge built into it. \u00a0Let's just say that I wasn't expecting that additional amount in the bill. \u00a0I guess I didn't do my homework right.",

    "text": "We were staying in London near Marble Arch, so the bus ride to The Laughing Gravy in Southwark was a bit of a venture, but my wife, son and I convinced my wife's parents and my aunt to make the trek to this quiet and somewhat off-the-beaten path location. Our meal turned out to be among the best we've ever had. The service was prompt but not pandering. Food was reasonably priced, excellently presented, and tested fantastic -- across the board, from the asparagus starter to the super food salad to the three-cheese roasted cauliflower macaroni. Ambiance was subdued, wth non-overbearing and pleasant music. Fortunately, we left room for dessert, which was extremely creatively presented and tasted even better. The restaurant also offers a library, from which you can select a book in exchange for a small donation. I highly recommend The Laughing Gravy if you are looking for an affordable, creative, well-prepared meal in a pleasant setting with outstanding service.",

    "text": "The Laughing Gravy is one of those gems. A small pub-style restaurant located just a stone's throw away from Southwark tube station offers a really delicious British food for affordable prices.Beetroot cooked in three different ways was a pleasant refreshing starter. Followed by an absolutely divine Sunday roast: tender meat marinated in Kernel Porter beer served with a lovely gravy (it wasn't laughing though, but made me smile). It was unquestionably one of the best roasts I had in London! Finishing off the meal with a mouth-watering dessert of chocolate filled of caramel and shortbread. All dishes were appetizingly plated up.The premises are small but cosy (with a few tables outdoors), plenty of light coming from a glass roof inside. A piano in the end of the room with an open sheet music book of an English sonata is a nice touch. Friendly service and more than reasonable prices.Will visit again? Definitely. estonianfoodie.com",

The host was welcoming and friendly and let us know that a table would be coming up soon as the first batch of early diners were finishing up. We didn't wait too long before we were seated.The restaurant is cosy but with clean lines and with a conservatory roof inside that adds a light, airy feel. Within a few minutes we were seated. The British menu is full of appeal and interest. For starters I chose the scotch egg with smoked rabbit and seafood vinagrette which was just fantastic. Wonderfully presented too.For mains it was butter poached and braised guinea fowl with a chicken, cep and truffle hash and pureed carrots, samphire and ransoms. Wow, this dish sounded great from the menu description and more than lived up to the expectation. This is super competent cooking and a chef who really knows what he is doing. Every component of the dish was perfection and the sum was greater than the parts and guinea fowl has always been a favourite of mine. Here it was heaven.Would have loved to try the deserts also which looked tempting but will have to wait for next time. The staff were great. Food came in just the right time and was served deftly from friendly staff. It's gone straight to my list of best restaurants.Good value too for such high quality cooking.",

The area is the place's main drawback, as there isn't really much around, so its not a place you'll find yourself by chance.That didn't seem to hold the place back, though, as the place was full, so obviously, making reservations is useful/necessary. Menu is good, with everything from cocktails and mocktails, various starters, mains, dessert, brunch, and a good wine list covering Italy, France, Spain, Australia, US, Chile, and more.We had the Sunday roast, completely with Yorkshire Puddings, and it was absolutely delicious, and well-presented. Roast was tender, juicy and perfectly cooked. Gravy was on of the best I've had anywhere, and the Yorkshire pudding had just the right combination of chewy base and flaky top. Had their chocolate cake for pudding and it was equally delicious.",

The beetroot itself was lovely, however if you are going to put caviar on someone's plate please list it on the menu as not everyone wants to eat fish eggs. My review would be 4 or 5 stars if this didn't happen. Next I had the Mac and cheese which was very delicious. The portion size was huge and I ended up taking some home with me. My partner got the venison Wellington which he enjoyed although the pastry was a bit soggy. Everyone around the table enjoyed their food and it seems the sea bass was the favourite of the night. The onion crisps on top and the crab champ went down a treat. Overall the evening was enjoyable, the staff were friendly and the food was nice.",
