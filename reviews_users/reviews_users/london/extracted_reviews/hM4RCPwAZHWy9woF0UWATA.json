    "text": "If you've ever walked around Angel you'll know there's a proliferation of places to eat and drink, but unfortunately the quality of these establishments varies wildly, which is why I was dubious about trying the Winchester- Any place that offers a large range of 2for1's normally spells trouble in this neck of the woods. I needn't have worried; the service, atmosphere and food were all great quality, as were the cocktails. I went on a Sunday for the 2for1 roasts and cocktails, and happily chomped on a free-range chicken breast with lots of fresh veg and crisp roast potatoes with extra gravy- I like my Sunday meals to be heavily lubricated to make the eating process a little easier to handle- and sipped daintily on a mojito, and came out with change from a tenner and a much depreciated hangover. The interior is really comfortable with big sofas ideal for chilling out on, and apparently they show films here some nights, as well as having DJs on the weekends. Definitely a nice local place and a damn sight better than some other local offerings.",

It's got a very nice interior, an interesting mix of traditional wall paper, thick golden picture frames and fancy modern orangey lights. It was a good place to watch the game too, not overly crowded, but not too lonely either. We all ordered their Sunday roast, which is served until 8pm, and it was good indeed (well, the potatoes could have been better, but apart from that!). Yummy! They have lots of different international beers and do cocktails too. I haven't tried those myself, but they looked damn good! Overall, this is a great, original pub to which I will definitely return.",

By day it sells good food, decent roasts on Sundays (at one point they were doing two for one, but not sure if that's still happening), and has big screens in the cellar downstairs for sports matches. By night there's a DJ (Thurs, Fri and Sat) and it's open late: till 3am on the weekend I believe. It's free in too, so it's a good alternative to the place up the road if you're looking for a fun night with friends and a bit of music. Not really much room to dance though. They also hire out the room downstairs for private parties. A decent boozer, worth a visit.",

    "text": "We were originally aiming for a quiet evening in this charming log-cabin style pub over some hot cocktails (which, I might add they have an abundant array). \u00a0So when the Kanye West-bumping, bar-crowding, ass-grabbing frat-party atmosphere overtook this humble pub, it came as a bit of a shock, to say the least. Yet after blinking a few times and adjusting my attitude, Bob's your uncle, it worked. Somehow, it totally worked. And before I knew it, I was immersed in the scene. We grabbed a table deep in the corner and watched as the debauchery ensued, making sure to enjoy every popped-collar minute of entertainment.I attribute my unexpected enjoyment to the following:1. The staff. Amazing, humble, funny bartenders go a looooong way. There were a few security guys near the door that actually helped me spot out my gem of a table and even watched my purse as I grabbed another chair. \u00a0It's the people that make the business, and these were the epitome of good people.2. The ambiance. \u00a0How can you not love drinking in a log-cabin in the middle of Islington? Decor straight from 1930 complete with a fire place, gramophones and printed maroon wallpaper, I expected Clark Gable and John Wayne to walk in arm-in-arm at any moment (trading bow ties and cowboy hats for stripped polos).3. The cocktail list. Ranging from the traditional to eclectic, the amount of love (in alcoholic form) that was put into each cocktail was damn impressive. If after reading all of this, you're cringing from the inside out, I would recommend skipping happy hour on Thursday nights. I've been back since and the scene was non-existent. In fact, Sundays at the Winchester involve 2-for-1 roasts, movie nights and drink specials. (Clark Gable not included.)",

Not realizing how big the meals were, we ordered some fries/chips with several dipping sauces for an appetizer. They were delicious! For mains, I ordered the roast beef, and the hubby got the pork. Two huge plates of food were presented, and we were both amused and flabbergasted in the best way possible. Our meats came on top of roasted root veggies, cabbage, cauliflower, potatoes, broccoli, and carrots...all covered with a delicious brown gravy. Everything was topped with a delectable yorkshire pudding. My beef was just a tad tough, but the hubby's pork was perfect. I could have definitely used a nap after finishing my plate! The food was wonderful, the price was excellent, and our cute blond server was attentive and thorough. Suffering from a bit of jetlag and confusion with the local currency, I wish I could go back and give him an extra tip for the great service he gave us. Overall, I would highly recommend The Winchester for a great British meal. We'll definitely be back!",

(Hint: have your cover ready!)I'd recommend the Winchester as, at least, a necessary stop on any tour of the Angel/Islington area.

We decided on the Winchester on Essex Road - a place we'd walked past a bunch of times and liked the look of but never tried.Being a Friday night it was busy with after work drinkers but not oppressively so. Bar service was quick and we managed to secure a table with a deft hover/swoop move. If there are more than two of you, definitely think about booking ahead.I ordered the burger and can highly recommend it - it's big and they're not afraid to leave some colour in the meat. And it comes with salad and chips. Lots of chips. Hoever, I'm not a fan of barbecue sauce, and this burger comes with a lot of it. My tip would be to order it without barbecue sauce or get it on the side. I still thought this was a great burger - so they must be doing something right.My girl ordered the veggie mezze platter for one and really enjoyed it - and it's easily enough for a couple of people.We really enjoyed this meal. The Winchester is a cute little place with a good feel.We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "I'm feeling all festive and generous so I'm rounding up a 3.5 star rating.I'll start by mentioning that I am glad a group of friends pointed out the Winchester's 2-for-1 Sunday pub lunch deal as a mechanism for getting our hung-over asses out of bed and into the fresh air (briefly, before sitting back down inside of course)... because- my first harsh impressions of the unsavoury crowd obviously found at this institution at other times of day, (ie Friday night), are less in favour for scoring in my book.So, judgements aside, I was too unimaginative to suggest an alternative option this dreary day, thus suppressing my would-be-protest given the 'other facade' I had previously sampled... I rocked up... and I'm jolly well glad I did!The items available for the aforementioned deal included roast beef/ roast lamb/ some sort of chicken (probably roast) with yorkshire pud, greens, potats etc plenty of gravy and various relishes. Some kind of 3-bean loaf for the veggie option which didn't look to bad actually. Can't say the food was the finest, but it's not that kind of pub. Good deal for \u00a36 when you've split it with your mate.Actually the Winchester boasts a rather charming and eclectic interior, something I was unable to appreciate on my prior misfortunate visit. Cosy timber dining room, the \u00a0booths stuffed with tapestry cushions, tassels and all that jazz. Sort of thing you want on a lethargic Sunday afternoon.One funny thing though- we ordered a cheese and meat platter for the table, which came in abundance, though no cranberry sauce/ chutney was provided, as advertised on the menu. When we enquired about this, the waitress did apologise that they had run out of it, but offered us some marmalade and strawberry jam instead?! In fact she just plonked down three little 'bon-maman' jars on the table, which we were quite puzzled about the meaning of their existence, and when asked, she shrugged and said she though that was a good replacement for the relish...",

I had the lamb roast which came with Yorkshire pudding, and a delicious mint jelly. My friend's beef roast also looked great. Dessert portions are large...try the banana crepe or the berry cobbler---both should come with ice cream, though our server needed to be reminded about that:) I only had beers, but from the looks of it they can make a few nice cocktails as well.I noticed all the other reviews commented about the late night shenanigans, but during the Sunday afternoon its a nice place for a meal. The interior is very cozy decorated in an electric pub style. Check out the chairs in the back rooms---all sorts of animals painted on the back of them. \u00a0Lots of big tables makes this place good for groups.If you're looking for a relatively inexpensive Sunday roast near Islington Green, the Winchester is worth checking out.",

After putting my own issues with reality to one side I discovered that The Winchester is actually a very nice pub with plenty of its own personality. Inside it resembles a log cabin with wood covering pretty much every surface. A warm fireplace acts as the centre point for the L-shaped bar although it's pretty rare to be able to get a seat near here. Sunday's are probably the best time to visit The Winchester. Start by taking advantage of their 2 for 1 roast dinner offer. The food here is of a fairly high quality and I've never been disappointed by anything I've ordered. After this there is plenty of time to enjoy a spot of Sunday boozing before sitting back to watch the Sunday film. Most often this is an oldie that everyone will enjoy like 'E.T.' or 'It's a Wonderful Life'. The screen is pretty small but it's always a treat to relax in a pub with a nice film and a warm fireplace. Clearly this pub has a bit more to it than first meets the eye!",
