    "text": "We celebrated my fianc\u00e9's birthday here on Saturday night. It was reasonably busy but our side of the restaurant was quite quiet and we prefer a buzzier atmosphere. Tasting menu did not disappoint. We're amateur cooks / wannabe foodies, and each dish shouted skill, inventiveness and quality ingredients. Flavours and textures were delightful. For example, the cauliflower mousse was so light it almost wasn't there and then the delicious surprise of a curry at the bottom of the petit dish. It really puts a smile on your face. The pork belly was awesome too, it's the fig reduction that complements the pork so well, although they save their customers from hacking through sticky crackling unfortunately (perhaps that's more for pub grub). Service was outstanding - the staff really made me feel appreciated. And the happy birthday script in chocolate on my fianc\u00e9's dessert plate was a lovely addition to seal what was a most memorable and rather calorific evening! We can't resist but return.",

We were shown to our table and the suited waiter brought the menu's and wine lists. It felt pretty intimidating and I was afraid to speak to loudly. The menu was very inetersting with lots of celebrity chef terms such as foam of pumpkin. To be honest though the food was absolutely stunning, great flavours and good portions. The wine was equally good. However as I was taken for lunch I did not see the bill so I cannot comment on value for money. I probably would not go here on my own accord but would happily be taken there again.",

My friend's pumpkin soup is declious and offers a good balance with the slightly salty sage dumplins. My main dish is the monkfish.

    "text": "Full post and photos @http://www.thecattylife.com \u00a0The brain child of chef Tristan Welch, I'd been reading all sorts of good things all over the food web about his recently refurbished restaurant, and if you're really clever, you would have worked out there were three hyperlinks in that little bunch of bolded words. Sneaky. No one had said anything less than Launceston Place being pretty awesome, so I was going in with slightly nerve-wreckingly high expectations. Interestingly, our first impressions weren't brilliant ~ the girl who asked if we'd like some champagne to start was probably barely out of highschool and ok my next comment might be a touch controversial but I'm not coming from a racist place, more from a can-you-speak-English place but she really struggled when we asked do you serve ros\u00e9 by the glass?. So much so that she mumbled something and hurried off to fetch a more experienced sommelier who offered us a very nice ros\u00e9 by the glass. No biggie. I totally forgot about it anyway because immediately following the little mishap (methods of distraction work in places other than magic shows), we were served an amuse bouche of devilled parsnip crisps, followed by a hot and cold leek soup. The devilled parsnip crisps were fantastic ~ crispy and spicy, wrapped delicately in a branded ribbon, and the hot and cold leek soup, oh it tugged at my heart strings and brought back fond memories of The Fat Duck where I had my very first, very bizarre experience of the hot and cold tea. The leek soup probably tasted more like potato soup on the bottom and cold pea froth on top, but that's ok. It wasn't bad and hey, it was free. Ok let's talk real food. We declined the 6 course tasting menu (\u00a360) for a 3 course set menu (\u00a345). I chose the west coast scallops roasted with aromatic herbs to start which in one descriptive word were: enormous. I really should have taken a photo of a scallop next to my head because they (and there were three) were probably some of the largest, meatiest scallops I'd seen in a while. Covered in garlicky, herby, buttery something or other, they tasted like a little piece of heaven. Panu's starter was equally delish ~ Denham Estate venison tartare with walnuts, bitter cress and a quail egg. The word tartare always excites me, but probably for the wrong reasons because basically, I picture a Korean yook hwei (which actually isn't even tartare so you see what I have to deal with on a daily basis? My brain. It doesn't make sense). It's all good, the tartare was so tender you could barely feel the meat but the taste was oomf.. delicious. It left us wondering what he'd seasoned the venison with but I doubt I'll ever find out. Mains. Wow, usually I fall head over heels in love with starters and desserts and in fact if I have a 2 course meal, I often skip the main all together. They're usually less creative and somewhat less delicious but there is a first for everything. My main ~ Tamworth suckling pig with radishes and honey emulsion ~ was my favourite course of the night. Hands down. Three little medallions of tenderly roasted pig, gorgeous little cooked radishes and slices of fresh radish and the salty-sweet taste of honey emulsion. Oh and lest I forget, the crowning glory (which I saved til last, of course) \u00a0a piece of crackle to rival all crackle. Yum. Panu ordered the wild seabass with chestnuts, chervil and ceps. Um, what are chervils and ceps? I didn't know before and actually, I'm none the wiser now either. I was far too engrossed in my own main to pay Panu any attention but I'm pretty sure he enjoyed his meal considering a couple of days later, I received an email saying seabass yum! And onto the sweet thangs! Well, before we actually get onto the really sweet stuff, we were served a pre-dessert, which in my world is like, well awesome can we also have a post-dessert? Interestingly the answer is yes. Brownie points for Mr Welch. The pre-dessert was pear sorbet and mulled wine mousse with spiced orange, which I thought was a palate cleanser (the pear sorbet being ever so light and tangy) until I tried the mulled wine mousse. It was nice but really, I think a thousand cinnamon pods died some angry deaths in that mousse because that was all I could taste. Lucky that was a freebie. Panu's dessert was a bit of a surprise. It was a set custard cream with caramel, praline and malt ice cream. We were both expecting something along the lines of a creme caramel and I mean pralines, doesn't that just make you think of Haagen Dazs pralines & cream? God, am I really so embarrassingly commercial? Yes, yes I am. Anyway it wasn't what we expected, but I think it was still good \u00a0the malt ice cream especially, which was luxuriously velvety and oops I just realised it's not even in the photo above. It was in the other corner. Sorry! My dessert was a winner ~ rice pudding souffl\u00e9 (which takes 20 minutes but it's 20 minutes of your life well spent) served with a separate jar of raspberry ripple ice",

    "text": "[Non-photo Review] Full review can be found here: wp.me/pwXBH-wZ \u00a0A GREAT MEAL AMBUSHED BY TOO MANY BUTS Hoping for a Great British Menu Launceston Place was on my hit-list for a good part of 2009 after I saw its Head Chef, Tristan Welch, appear on Great British Menu, the BBC television program that invites two great chefs from each region of Britain to prepare dishes that represent both their local area and 'Britishness' in general, with the winning dishes featuring at some gala event to be held at the end of the series, and cooked by the chefs who invented them. I liked what he was doing on the small screen (he won his heat too), and his gastronomic creations looked very enticing. So, one October evening, Mrs. LF and I set off to see if the Welchman would deliver. Launceston Place looks slightly odd from outside. It is housed within a semicircular fa\u00e7ade and is kitted out in a black tie paint scheme. It almost gives off the feeling of a very posh pub that caters to the wealthy people living in the nearby environs. In any case, we located the correct doorway (there are a few doors that lead nowhere) and were pleasantly surprised upon entering. There is a very pretty little bar area as you enter the restaurant, where you can have an ap\u00e9ritif or wait for other members of your party to arrive. We decided to go straight to our table, however, which was off to the left side of the restaurant. They layout of the place is quite unique, with tables on either side of the central bar station, and also behind this area (which also seems to serve as a dishwashing and plating-up station), and adds a bit of interest. The decor is also fairly iconoclastic and I liked it \u00a0black walls throughout with brooding artwork, but with little splashes of color here and there. To me, it almost seemed like going into someone's very nice home, where the dining room led into yet another little dining room. It's worth mentioning that they also have a very nice private room on the lower level, where instead of actually being in the kitchen (i.e. a Chef's Table), you are in a mock library that has a video display of the kitchen and two-way microphones (they call it the Chef's Office), so you can chat with the chef(s) as they work (I am sure they must love that!). The building has served as a restaurant of some kind for a long time, and I think Tristan and the folks at D&D London (a spin-off from Terrence Conran's restaurant group in which he still owns 51%, and which took over Image Restaurants, of which Launceston Place was a part, in June 2007) have done a fantastic job in updating the premises. For instance, our table for two made clever use of the space by having one seat on the end of the benching attached to the wall, and the other chair placed 90 degrees away (instead of facing each other) \u00a0enabling them to squeeze another table for 2 across the pathway. But enough about design, architecture and acquisitions. Save for the last topic, that is not really my expertise. Starry, starry night? I thought the menu read brilliantly, and had a very hard time deciding what to order as there were so many things I wanted to try. While we were pondering the possibilities, some very nice devilled parsnip crisps were brought to the table, wrapped neatly with a little bit of Launceston Place branded black ribbon. In the end, we went for the 3-course menu, as previous experience with tasting menus on the first visit made us a bit wary. But before our starters manifested: the bouches were coming, the bouches were coming. And I am glad they did, because the leek soup was really fresh and awakened our palates. The contrasting temperatures worked well, and it had a nice light, creamy and froth-like quality about it (7/10). The sourdough bread was also very nice \u00a0and if memory serves me right (?), it is made in-house (7/10) Starter 1: West Coast Scallops Roasted with Aromatic Herbs from the Coast LineMy starter of scallops was beautifully presented on a wooden slab with the molluscs served in their shells. It was a very accomplished dish in the sense that the scallops were cooked perfectly and were also large, juicy and very flavorful. The subtle seasoning of 'aromatic herbs' harmonized well and let the scallops do the talking. It wasn't a 'wow' dish but I don't think that was the intention. 7/10. Starter 2: Poached Goose Egg, Somerset Truffle RisottoWe both agreed that Mrs. LF's starter was one of the better things we had eaten in a while. It was also cleverly conceived in terms of the flavors and stylish presentation. Hidden beneath a topping of black Somerset truffles (English trufflesI am learning something new every day) was an unctuous, rich and delicious risotto that was perfect in pretty much every way. I was surprised at how pungent the truffles were and the strong depth of flavor they possessed (I thought English truffles would have been much lighter than their Continental counterparts), and the addition of little toast soldiers was a",

My short stop for a glass of wine turned into the most delicious dinner ever. I started with the Simplissime which consisted of aerated potatoes, blue crab, and tarragon. The dish already speaks for itself with the aerated potatoes and blue crab! For the main course I had the Guinea fowl with brown and green cauliflower, baby cauliflower, and pomegranate.

    "text": "\"Diana ate here. \u00a0A lot.\" \u00a0This is a quote from The Guardian's review of Launceston Place. \u00a0It is 10 minutes from Kensington Palace, and the warren of small dining rooms does make it easier to be discreet. \u00a0Since Diana, the restaurant has been revamped, and now helmed by chef Tristan Welch. \u00a0Launceston Place was a fitting finale to my week of culinary delights in London.The restaurant is done up in moody, sultry tones. \u00a0It is mostly hushed, with a battalion of staff hovering with intent, ready to cater to one's whims. \u00a0The furnishings and setting are ultra luxe without being grandiose. \u00a0After settling in, we were presented with an amuse bouche of potato crisps. \u00a0These were meticulously punched out in the middle (I mean perfect circles), and tied together with a black satin ribbon bearing the restaurant's name. \u00a0It was a tad precious for my taste, but if that is their kind of attention to detail, I'm all for it.We decided on a bottle of 2005 Teresa Manara negroamaro, from Salento, in anticipation of the red meat we'd picked for our mains. \u00a0So to start, Wild Sea Trout, Isle of Wright Tomatoes, Pickled Cucumber, Basil; and Pea and Home Cured Ham Tartlet. \u00a0The trout was slightly smoked, and the veggies supplemented the freshness of the dish. \u00a0For the tart, beneath ribbons of ham, the peas were a coarse spread over a butter cracker. \u00a0Both were light, but extremely flavorful. \u00a0For mains, we had Rose Veal Rump, Nettles, Pickled Mushrooms; and Denham Castle Lamb, Charlotte Potatoes, Wild Garlic. \u00a0If you're anti-veal, please stop reading now. \u00a0All I can say is, if there is meat like this everyday, I will gladly eat it everyday. \u00a0The pickled mushrooms were a pleasant surprise, bringing a jolt to the meltingly tender meat. \u00a0The lamb had 2 preparations. \u00a0A few pieces of loin seared medium rare, resting on top of a mound of braised lamb. \u00a0The flavor was absolutely intense, and the garlic and potatoes just brought it to another level. \u00a0For intermezzo, Pimm's gelee covered with a blanket of lemon granita. \u00a0Hmmm, I must attempt this at home.For pudding, English Strawberries, Lavender Set Cream, Shortbread, Nyetimber Sparkling Wine. \u00a0This was an English trifle in a glass. \u00a0The sparkling wine, in gelee form, was a pleasant introduction to the layers of sweetness underneath. \u00a0The other pudding was Warm Smoked Dark Chocolate and Laphroiag Whiskey Ice Cream. \u00a0My partner thought this was too aggressive, but I completely loved it. \u00a0I wavered on whether all the woodsy-ness was going to be overpowering, but in the end, it worked. \u00a0The ganache was luscious, with hints of smokiness on every bite. \u00a0The whiskey ice cream was just genius. \u00a0Chocolate, cream, alcohol, wood on wood. \u00a0Amen.Why 5 stars? \u00a0Service is absolute perfection. \u00a0The surroundings are serene and very discreet. \u00a0The food is very inventive and delicious, yet very approachable. \u00a0If I live in London, I would also eat here. \u00a0A lot.",

Really wonderful flavor. \u00a0 Third Course: West coast scallop roasted with aromatic herbs from the coast line. \u00a0Cooked right in the shell it grew in. \u00a0Just great!Fourth Course: \u00a0Celery sorbet, walnuts and apples. \u00a0Surprisingly intense celery flavor, yet it worked as a palate cleanser.Fifth Course: Denham Castle lamb, Charlotte potatoes, wild garlic. \u00a0We thought the flavor was just perfect. Sixth Course (Dessert): Rice pudding souffle, raspberry ripple ice cream. \u00a0Who would expect rice pudding could be made into souffle? \u00a0Creative, light, wonderful.After dinner, we were presented with hand-made candies, which we took back to our hotel. \u00a0We met the chef, Tristan Welch, who was really nice! \u00a0The Maitre D helped us get a reservation for Marcus Wareing, two nights later \u00a0- better known, but not as good as this place.",

    "text": "An enjoyable meal - but truthfully, not as groundbreaking as I had hoped or expected. What I liked? The bread, served with absolutely delicious salted butter and pickled herring. A beautifully presented Scallop with Herbs - the shellfish itself was soft, sweet, and rich; easily among the best starters that I've had in recent memory. The Chocolate Souffle was outstanding: impossibly light and creamy with a thin sugary crust on top.What was closer to average? The service - at times during the meal, the waitstaff seemed confused and disorganised (despite several reminders, they forgot that my dining companion was vegetarian; even bringing out the same dish twice - by mistake - for our Tasting Menu!). The food selection for vegetarians could also have been better. In lieu of a diverse and well-choreographed slate of tastes, the kitchen turned out one flavour (buttery/creamy richness) in 4 different ways. The Truffled Duck Egg, even with a small mountain of truffles, was a little flavourless (though it could just be the case that poached eggs aren't my thing...)In all, we had a good time here. The wine list is excellent; and the atmosphere is equal parts trendy and clubby. I will come back - but my expectations won't be as high as my first visit.",

I have had an excellent dinner here with a friend and we both thoroughly enjoyed each course w/ nice surprises in between, like the amuse bouche. The slow cooked duck egg melted in my mouth. I also went for a Rioja wine tasting w/ my husband. A lovely date night, not only to experience an education on Rioja, but also enjoy pairings of canap\u00e9s with each tasting. After moving to London from NYC, Launceston Place feels like home. High quality dining from every facet. And the cherry on top, is its location. A cozy nook off of Gloucester Road...warm an inviting. The food, the experience. It's not just a reservation, it's an extraordinary dining event.",

    "text": "First Course \u00a0Duck egg on toast, Somerset truffle Firstly, I have never been served so many truffle slices on one plate. The aroma wafts and engulfs you in a sensory delight before you even taste it. Start eating...HELLO!! Eyes open wide, I loveI loveI love Everything works and harmonise together that I and other duck egg on toast choosers were on cloud nine. The silky almost creamy yolk from the duck egg soaked into the toast and it sticks and swirls in your mouth. So rich and so creamy, combined the truffles and it is seriously an umami gastronomic experience. I was seriously at the point where I couldn't care less about the other first courses eaten by the others, LOL! This was and is the best dish I had there and definitely ranks highly on my top 10 list. The rest of the menu was delectable but did not make as big an impact as this one.

    "text": "We enjoyed the Chef's Table recently to celebrate the 45th wedding anniversary of my husband's parents. I cannot say enough good things about the crew here - they put up with my father-in-law over-sharing about his GERD (why he cannot have red wine) multiple food allergies (balsamic vinegar, red wine, shellfish, all seafood...) and two little girls under ten who wanted to know exactly what was on their plate.The presentation was flawless, and I loved being able to view the kitchen via flat screen TV. The meal was one of the most memorable of my life - risotto in a duck egg, topped with truffle shavings, cauliflower soup with a creme fresh foam, pork with skin so crackled that even my Cuban in-laws were impressed. My two nieces were even invited into the kitchen to \"assist\" with dessert preparation. Our waited was clever enough to ask for a camera and took some great pictures of them with the chefs. My only complaint? That I wasn't as hungry 5 or 6 courses in to fully enjoy the cheese and desserts! But I happily waddled home knowing that Launceston Place would be on any future London itineraries.",

    "text": "Please also seehungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  Pretentious as shit but worth it - this is Launceston Place very accurately described with the words of RS. I have to say \u00a0my evening at Launceston Place was highly enjoyable on many levels and it made me very happy. This is how dining out should be. Most importantly, the food was extraordinary. What really stood out was their incredible attention to detail and the thought that seem to have gone into every little thing. It was not only that everything tasted like heaven, but also each plate was presented like a work of art. You have to choose 3 courses from a set menu for 48 pounds. I was not so convinced about this in the beginning as I usually don't eat desserts, but hadn't I be forced to the last course I would have missed out big time! For the starters we had the beef tartar with barley, which was mild and full of subtle flavour. The only criticism could be that the beef was quite coarse, which I actually really enjoyed while RS was not entirely convinced. Lovely was the asparagus with snails and sunflower seeds. The sunflower seeds went surprisingly well with the perfectly cooked, crunchy green asparagus. The two lonely snails were unncessary but did not spoil the dish. The mains were served lukewarm, probably it took so long to make them pretty, but they were delicious anyway. The lamb with potatoes and wild garlic was a dream. The perfectly cooked medium rare meat literally melted in my mouth. I was in food paradise! The hot smoked halibut with wild fennel served with a light dill sauce did not quite reach the level of the lamb, but nevertheless was very tasty. There is only one thing I am still confused about: the fish was served on little brown branches, I still have no idea if they were supposed to be eaten or only decoration.. I did eat some of them, they really did not taste of much and I clearly got my share of cellulose Now the dessert Warm smoked dark chocolate with Laphroiag whisky ice cream was another food heaven moment \u00a0for me, the Laphroiag ice cream was the superstar among many starts of the evening. I should mention that I love whiskey, the peatier the better and they manged to pack all these flavours into an ice cream! It was so absolutely delicious! It was also a brave dish as Laphroiag is a very strongly flavoured whiskey and probably not to everyone's taste. I'm sure the chocolate fondant and also the second dessert (Rhubarb and custard) were good too but I couldn't say as I had just fallen in love with my whiskey ice cream, sorry :) Now back from the seventh cloud to something we did not like very much \u00a0the wine list. It was off-putting, pretentious and ridiculously over-priced. I know, it's an expensive restaurant, but is this a reason to offer only one wine of each colour under 30 pounds? We boycotted this and went for the 20 pound bottle which was actually really nice. The atmosphere I find is perfect for a (good) date \u00a0not only comfortable and intimate but also \u00a0due the little surprise dishes you get served in between courses \u00a0you really don't feel rushed to finish your food quickly. Overall, this was the most outstanding food I have had this year and I recommend everyone to go there and enjoy Tristan Welch's cooking \u00a0I hope it will put a big smile into your face too!",

    "text": "For the prices this charges, I expected better. We were there on a quiet Monday evening, and I found myself comparing it to The Ivy or Claridges. It is good, but for that amount of money, I expect it to be, and compared to those two establishments, it just didn't hold up. The service was slow - it was difficult to attract a waiter when we wanted one. The actual staff were really kind and lovely, and contributed to the ambience.The cep risotto was good, presented nicely, but wasn't particularly out of the ordinary, none of the subtle flavours that I might have expected. The veal Tartare was wonderful, by contrast. Subtle, intelligent food, flavours that set different parts of the mouth alight.The cauliflower cappuccino really didn't do it for me - nice flavour, well presented, but not what I wanted (and I hadn't ordered it).The cheese selection - was good. The warm chocolate, however, was absolutely stunning.Presentation was nice - they used slates, copper vessels, plates and so on. Again nothing that took me by surprise or stood out in a good way. The wine choices, recommended by the Sommelier, were really fab, and getting wine to match the dishes really brings a lot to the experience. I would recommend this place for something special. It is lovely, and has a quirky feel to it. It just didn't quite do it for me.",

    "text": "murrayblake.wordpress.com Launceston Place has just won a Michelin star and I think the accolade is fully deserved. Head chef Tim Allen is from Yorkshire which is starkly evident in his cooking: whilst its quality is outstanding, his food is completely unpretentious (not a hint of foam in sight!) but in no way boring, the presentation of his dishes is first class and their balance perfect. The restaurant is a 10 minute walk from Kensington High St. tube, but it is nestled in a beautiful upper class residential neighbourhood. The interior is split over a few rooms and the tables are well spaced, giving it a private, intimate feel which is enhanced by the staff who carry out their duties without affectation. (murrayblake.files.wordpr\u2026)We opted for the tasting menu which consisted of 6 courses for \u00a360 (but get there quick because the price will surely go up now that it has won a star), they also offer an a la carte menu at a cost of \u00a340-60 per head. Our first dish, slow cooked duck egg with girolles mushrooms and pea veloute was magnificent \u00a0it looked very pretty and was perfectly cooked; it was very well balanced with the richness of the duck egg offset by the freshness of the peas. This was followed by a slightly more complicated dish: roasted scallop and pork belly with apple and celeriac \u00a0this hit a near perfect note for me, with a sublime mix of textures (soft scallop against a crisp and rich pork belly). The only black mark was the front to back lamb main \u00a0whilst the tongue, sweetbread and loin were perfectly cooked, the neck was cold and tough \u00a0it think it will be difficult to execute this dish so that all the elements are perfectly cooked and arrive at the table still warm. (murrayblake.files.wordpr\u2026) A decent cheese course (although the cheese board is not huge), was followed by a simple palate cleansing granita. (murrayblake.files.wordpr\u2026)The dessert was a triumph \u00a0a perfectly risen souffl\u00e9, which had a beautiful light texture and a, strong raspberry essence, softly breaking into a rich white chocolate centre. VerdictIf you have something to celebrate then I would strongly recommend a visit to Launceston Place \u00a0and make a move as soon as you can because its popularity is sure to explode now that it has won a star.

    "text": "I do love a good fish pie, but Launceston Place's 'stargazey pie' is infinitely more imaginative and devilishly witty. I was lucky enough to sample this starter the other night at this impressive Kensington eatery, headed up by Tristan Welch. I was initially a bit put off by the sight of the sardine tail crudely curling out over the side of the bowl from under a pastry crust, when the dish arrived. It looked like the poor fish had plopped straight into it from the sea. The waiter had also warned me - when I was considering what to order - that the sardine would be served whole in the pie, with the head left on. It was \"to allow it to look up to the stars,\" he explained theatrically. Anyway, by the time I got under the pastry crust and tasted the delicate fish and subtle creamy sauce, my tastebuds were too tickled to care. My friend and I both also chose fishy main courses: wild seabass, beetroot, purple sprouting broccoli and wild garlic, and hot smoked halibut with wild fennel. These were also exquisite. My only complaint was the 15-minute delay in being seated (surprising for a 9pm booking on a Thursday) and a 40-minute wait between courses. However, the staff more than made up for it with their friendly professionalism. All in all, quite a catch....despite the hefty price tag.",

On the occasion that we were there the restaurant was quite empty which was a shame as that interior need some ambience injected.But the food makes up for it. Plus the amount of amuse bouches and pre-desserts makes this really good value. Presentation is also a very strong point, my crab risotto came with a whole crab shell covering it, the pre-dessert was creme brulee in an eggshell. So cute! I wish this had been my real dessert I could have eaten a lot more of it! Recommeded but only if you go with enough people to create your own atmosphere. And at the end they give ladies a little package of caramel brittle to take away which I though was a lovely touch",

Beautifully presented,very innovative and with a great attention to detail, you immediately realize that you're in a special place. The service is very professional and attentive. Only reason not to give it 5 stars (but would give 4.5 if I could) is I find the decor a bit cold and the bar area uninviting. Perhaps if we'd had a window seat I would not have noticed as much. Will definitely return often.",

We ordered fois gras for starter, pork for main, then strawberry with merengue for dessert. All dishes were perfectly done. Particularly liked the pork, which was very tender and flavourful with all its sauce and sides. Service was also impeccable. Needless to say, they were prompt and kind but also, served about three small plates as complimentary to cleanse our palates. Ambience was the perfect balance of posh and neighbourhood favourite. Not too fanciful but very tasteful in all its interior and atmosphere. Would highly recommend it!",

Fairly quiet, hushed tones, somewhat older and more reserved client\u00e8le, male customers in suits for the most part.My wife and I got the market menu and, while not looking for value, it was a tremendous value for the quality of food. Wine is not cheap but if we had drank more of it we maybe would have noticed that.Food was spectacular. Delicious, interesting flavours and textures, and some of the best presentation I have ever seen, and we've eaten at many Michelin star restaurants. I would probably rate this 2 Michelin stars, definitely a cut above the other 1 star places we've eaten at in London.It was somewhat shocking to us (having moved to London from NYC recently) that some prime tables remained empty the whole evening.

Some very refreshing flavours and strange uses of ingredient arrangements but they worked wonders in most cases. It is always good to see a restaurant that continues to push forward and seek perfection. Places like Dinner by Heston Blumenthal still cook pretty much the same dishes since it was opened and I just can't see what is the appeal to go back if you always get the same thing over and over again. But pushing the boundaries always carries a risk but in Tim's case, I definitely see plenty of progression compared to my very first visit. Tim and his team have indeed got a bright future ahead if they carry on like this.",

Price-wise I think this is the place to beat in terms of quality and creativity among the one star Michelin places in London. \u00a0One might find the lunch set menu somewhat limited but for the price asked I'll still believe it offers a great variety. Considering the fact you are spoiled with Amuse-bouche in between your set lunch courses it is plenty of food and variety one might desire especially if one prefers the lunch to be a somewhat lighter meal of the day. Still for those who prefer a bigger variety LP offers a market menu that is utterly satisfying and still a good bang for the buck. This intricate menu is where I for instance found my favourite starter of all time; The Cornish Mackerel. The attentive, but never in your face, staff offer great service and friendly accommodation that together with the food and the cool ambiance of the restaurant makes me believe this is a place hungry and striving for another Michelin star. And I for one think they should and deserve to get it.",

    "text": "We came here for a special birthday dinner. \u00a0It has a warm neighbourhood restaurant feel, almost hidden among the houses in the area. \u00a0We both had the tasting menu with a celebratory glass of champagne to commence and a bottle of Californian red wine to enjoy for the rest of the evening.We were originally seated close to a pair of loud women. \u00a0It was going to be too annoying so we asked to be moved to a different table, and they were happy to do this for us. \u00a0I noticed that another couple also came in shortly after us and it seemed that they had had the same issue with the same loud people. \u00a0Obviously, this isn't something the restaurant can do much to avoid, but I appreciated their response to help us.The overall service was amiable and helpful, but sometimes you felt like you needed to look for them if you stood up to, say, look for the bathroom. \u00a0It is one-Michelin star service, not three-Michelin star service.The amuse bouches were nice and simple. \u00a0Two of them, really, which came out separately. \u00a0Light pastry puffs with a blue cheese filling and mini croquettes, followed by a small glass of cauliflower soup.The bread selection was not too special. \u00a0They had white and brown choices, but they both seemed like breads you would get in the supermarket.The tasting menu proper:* Cornish Mackerel. \u00a0Cold smoked and grilled, rose gooseberries and tartare, charred cucumber and iced grain mustard. \u00a0Mackerel seems to be the \"in\" thing at the moment, and when it is prepared like this, it is easy to see why. \u00a0This was one of the highlights. \u00a0Tender and delicious.* Warm Allenheads Grouse. \u00a0Cobnuts, crumbed frozen fois gras, iberico lardo and peaches. \u00a0The combination was good, but for me the peaches were not quite ripe enough.* West Coast Scallop and Iberian pig's cheek. \u00a0Carrot and star anise, romanesco cauliflower, sesame and five spice. \u00a0It must have been a big scallop to begin with, because mine came out cut into a square shape. \u00a0It was well cooked, though: nice colouring on the outside but not overcooked in the middle.For the main course, we had an option. \u00a0I decided on the plaice and my wife had the veal fillet.* Hand speared plaice, english crayfish and seashore herbs. \u00a0The plaice was well-prepared, but for me it doesn't have much flavour. \u00a0I think it is more about the texture and what accompanies it on the plate. \u00a0It came with a mini \"sausage\" made of crayfish which looked like it would take a lot of effort to prepare. \u00a0Except for that, it looked like a very simple dish.* English veal fillet, porcini mash, girolles and madeira sauce. \u00a0In retrospect, I think this was the better main. \u00a0The veal was cooked to the right point of rareness and the porcini mash was delicious.* Selection of English and French cheeses. \u00a0While we were asked what types of cheeses we preferred, it would have been better if we were shown the cheese trolley and could choose some directly from there.* Lemon. \u00a0A simple name, but a very refreshing cleanser of lemon done many ways: icecream, granita and mousse. \u00a0All three parts were equally good and this was one of my favourite courses.* Apricot souffle, apricot brandy sauce and its own sorbet. \u00a0This was the top highlight for me. \u00a0I am a fan of desserts, but even allowing for that, this was the course that I would still remember months down the line. \u00a0The waiter presented the souffles in front of us, as if he were delivering a prize for inspection. \u00a0It's great when the souffle rises perfectly, as these ones did. \u00a0To our false cries of objection, he punctured the top and poured in the apricot brandy sauce. \u00a0So delicious! \u00a0I savoured every spoonful.We rounded off the meal with coffee and tea and petits fours. \u00a0We were so full and content that we ordered a minicab to take us home, rather than negotiate the tube system.",

    "text": "I decided on my last [leisure/non-work] trip to London to go to a top-notch restaurant. I'm a bit spoiled by NYC restaurants so I wanted to see what London had to offer. It did not disappoint! I believe I found Launceston Place on a travel blog or in an online version of a London mag/newspaper. The reviews looked enticing and the pre fixe menu (the Market Menu) at \u00a348 wasn't too bad on my wallet. I got to the restaurant about 20 minutes early and they were able to accommodate me. Granted, the place looked a bit sparse of diners. The entire wait staff was ready to go and pounced on me when I got in. I think I had at least 4 people walk by in the first 5 minutes I was sitting there: host/Ma\u00eetre d', server, sommelier, and a water server. It was a bit much considering it was just me but they weren't overbearing and pushing me to make some choices. That's pretty much how service progressed throughout the meal - plenty of people ready, willing and able. First course: spring vegetable salad (truffle cream cheese, pickled carrots, salt baked vegetables, grain mustard and honey) rocked. It was the highlight of the meal. Very well flash-cooked veggies dressed in a nice vinaigrette with truffle shavings and the truffle cheese. I LOVE truffles. End of story.Unfortunately the main course left a little to be desired. I ordered the Rhug Estate organic chicken. Wonderful in theory - executed with a lot too much salt. I think I made it through 2/3 of the course and put my fork down. I did tell the server but there wasn't much they could do at that point. My mistake in continuing to eat it.Dessert course (for me cheese course) was nothing spectacular though the server nailed it with her descriptions of the local cheese selection. Just enough to round out my meal with a few sweet notes. The sommelier made some excellent suggestions in apertifs as well as wine to accompany my meal.",

We had a good experience - it is located in a charming, quiet neighborhood and is bright and minimalistic inside.The set lunch menu is a pretty good deal; we happened to be there for Sunday lunch. We were served 2 amuses - choux pastries with bechamel inside and a tomato slush of sorts that somehow captured the best flavors a tomato can offer. I got the duck egg to start and hubby tried the grouse. Both dishes were light and well made. I loved the baby peas on mine. Then I had the plaice with homemade linguini that was smothered in a butter sauce. Sinfully rich, yet somehow still light. I did find a couple bones in my fish, which isn't a big deal to me but apparently is a no-no for a nice place. To their credit, at a 3 star place in Paris I also found a few bones. A European thing? Anyhow, hubby's pork 'presa' was delicious, an elevated take on classic comfort food.We finished with the chocolate mousse and baked English custard. If I had to only pick one I'd go with the custard, not that the mousse wasn't great but I have had similar elsewhere. Looking back now that our trip is over, this is a very good restaurant but maybe not as creative as the other one star places we tried.",

The staff were friendly and the food was first rate. There is really nothing negative to deter one from going there, especially for an anniversary or to impress a serious date. Its just that for me nothing really stood out as exciting or different which is why I only gave it 3 stars. It really is more 3 1/2 stars in my mind as everything was exactly as it should be, tasted lovely, it was just nothing I hadn't seen or eaten before. And there is nothing wrong with that. If you want a cozy place to have a relaxing meal and quiet conversation this is a perfect spot.",
