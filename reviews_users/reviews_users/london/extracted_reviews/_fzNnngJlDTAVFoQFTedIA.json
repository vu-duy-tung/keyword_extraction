    "text": "My hubby and I were visiting family in London (Islington) over the holidays and we were on a mission to eat our way through the city having already done the sightseeing on various other trips.Being a huge fan of spicy Indian (all sorts: \u00a0Guju/South/North, veg/non-veg) we were stoked to try Sheba since their chef was notable. \u00a0Upon entering the door, we negotiated 25% off our meal and a free bottle of wine. \u00a0This haggling is customary on Brick Lane...good for us Americans! \u00a0The menu was huge and the food was very good. \u00a0The problem was this:At the very beginning of the meal, our party of 4 told the waiter that we were celebrating and that we wanted to take our time dining. \u00a0We were looking to have starters/apps with cocktails then move our way slowly into dinner. \u00a0He seemed to understand this, confirming our wishes, but he still insisted on taking our entire order immediately, saying he'd be sure that our meal went slow. \u00a0Please note we dined on a Monday night so the restaurant was not busy, no need to push the tables out the door. \u00a0 \u00a0The bhaji was outstanding as was the assortment of chutneys. \u00a0The lamb samosa was very good, but the veg samosa was still cold, in parts partially frozen. \u00a0Literally, 5 minutes into our starters, he brought out our main meals and said he had to because it was \"ready and would've gotten cold\". \u00a0My husband reiterated that we didn't want our meals that fast and the waiter apologized and agreed to buy us a round of drinks. \u00a0After a single sip of the wine we received as a concession to our early mains, we realized they were spiked with some sort of inedible concoction....tasted very similar to acetone! \u00a0It was appalling and very easily could have landed one of us in the hospital! \u00a0I have never experienced something like this in any of my travels and it's such a shame that this had to happen on such a fantastic trip in such a great city. \u00a0I highly advise that if you do decide to dine here, request that your beverages come to your table sealed.....or better yet, TAKE YOUR OWN!!!!",

He showed us to our table and left us with the menu. Even whilst he was doing two people's work he made us feel welcome and was happy to help us all he could with recommendations. Considering the service was below normal standards I thought it was fantastic.The food was also very good. When the doors swing open and the aroma from the kitchen hits the restaurant you can smell the fresh herbs and spices. At the end of our meal, we had to wait longer than normal for our bill to arrive but they were understaffed and we were so happy that we were in no real rush to leave.Next time you are looking for lunch or dinner around Brick Lane I would strongly advise you pop into Sheba.",

The portions were a little bigger than some other places, but I've been told by my mates that there are slightly bigger portions elsewhere on the street. Nonetheless, the meal size was just right overall. The service was indeed very slow, and that's what keeps this from being a 4 or a 5 we had to ask multiple times for my friend's glass of water and our food (even the naan) took quite a while. However, the deal was decent at \u00a310/person when we each had a curry dish, naan, rice, poppadoms and a half-pint.",

The only positive from the whole experience were the meat dishes and the fact I have a great story to tell my friends about one of the worst service experiences in my life. 15GBP/pp was barely worth it given the value one can get on brick Lane otherwise. \u00a0Sadly we heard the table next to us similarly complaining of how immensely bad service it was - - \u00a0so I know it's not a one off. Reasons I am assigning one star:-Took one hour to get water after 5 requests-Waiter argued back when they gave my vegetarian friend LAMB samosa(repeatedly claiming it was Veggie)?! Only After we put the Plate 1 inch from his nose , he finally brought a replacement ...-They simply decided never to bring one of our naans and no paradox we ordered. Upon asking about the paradox, they claimed \"sorry we are out, kitchen forgot to mention earlier. We wont charge you\". Well guess what- it was part of the prix fix ...??-Nonveg dishes were C- grade (channa, aloo saag, bhindi)-They added an optional 10% service charge)(I understand this is becoming more common in London now) and we saw the waiters arguing over who had to bring the check over (nobody wanted to do it) - to top it off, \u00a0The ceiling started to DRIP on our table right after we paid the bill. A few minutes earlier and our food would have been contaminated...\"ONLY SAVING GRACE\"+The chicken jalfrezi and lamb gosht dishes were DELICIOUS, B+ gradeThe owner prides himself on great food. \u00a0the few meat dishes are truly great...However running a business, you need to treat your customers right. And the current status is beyond acceptable in my eyes.I've been to 5 different brick Lane houses and would recommend you take your money elsewhere.",

    "text": "I told my London hosts that I absolutely had to have Indian food while I was visiting. \u00a0They were more than happy to oblige and to Brick Lane we went. \u00a0The customary thing to do, according to my friends, is to walk up and down the Lane in search of the best deal. \u00a0Deals come in the way of men standing outside the door of each restaurant calling to us \"friends\" and offering 20, 25 and even 30% off the bill, no service charge, and a round of drinks for free. \u00a0Hell, one guy even offered us two rounds of free drinks. \u00a0But we moved on. We eventually ended up at Sheba. \u00a0I usually order the Chicken Vindaloo when I'm stateside, but my friend had warned me that the Vindaloo in these parts was very very spicy, as the menu indicated. \u00a0So I settled on the Chicken Ceylan instead. \u00a0My friends, believe me when I tell you that \"Fairly Spicy\" \u00a0on Sheba's menu really translates to \"burn the shiz out of your mouth and make your upper lip and brow sweat\" hot hot hot! \u00a0I'm no stranger to spicy food, but this...this was beyond bearable. \u00a0I just couldn't enjoy the meal. The naan was good, but the saag paneer we had on the side was just what I'd call okay. \u00a0A couple of the other dishes I tried on the table were tasty, but lacked the heat I had wanted. \u00a0Our waiters were kinda rude - like one rolled his eyes at me when I asked for a straw kind of rude. \u00a0But according to my friends, that's just par for the course with most service in London. \u00a0So I chose not to take the eye-rolling to heart. One big upside to this place - the table wine we ordered was really very tasty. \u00a0Even the Italians sitting at our table liked it and ordered a second round. \u00a0That says a lot! \u00a0I'd like to try Indian food again while I'm in town, but for the safety of my taste buds, I'll probably take my business elsewhere.",

I can't remember what it took to get us to plop down in this place, but damn, I'm glad it worked. The place was reasonably packed for such a late hour of the night but the level of service hadn't diminished in the least. \u00a0The menu was larger than life and not being a novice in ordering Indian food, I ordered whatever sounded best. And Butter Chicken sounded best. Damn, can I pick some winners. My friend and I raved about this dish for months following our trip. This thing was awesome in every sense of the word. Rich, hot, and buttery greatness. I honestly don't remember what else we ordered because this was the only thing on my mind. I completely forgot about it until a few months ago when I was in Little India (Artesia,CA) and ran through the aisles looking for some gulab jamun to make at home. Lo and behold, I found some butter chicken mix on the shelf that jogged my memory and brought me back to Sheeba.I'm sure you can't go wrong with any of the Indian joints on the block and there can't be too much variance in what everyone's cooking, but if you're \u00a0splitting hairs, check these guys out.

I was afraid to eat too much spicy, but It was the perfect balance. I tasted the vegetables, very very good! I tasted the \"Peshwari Naan\" stuffed with almond and coconuts which was very original and yummy! I finished my meal by a nice pistachio ice cream.It was definitely an excellent food experience and in my mind the great Indian restaurant I have ever tasted. The Staff is very kind and helpful. They used to serve to each client an appetiser: special Indian pan and several nice sauces. Lovely. I like also the room of the restaurant and the soft light which creates a nice atmosphere. I definitely recommend to everyone to choose this restaurant. It is located at the end of the Bricklane Avenue.

No-one had any complaints (although my onion bhajis were a little too greasy) about the standard of their meal... when it eventually came. The reason I am rating this low is because of the service we received. Our waiter had a real attitude and seemed to struggle with basic tasks. He came to our table asking if we wanted to order. We said yes. He asked if we wanted popadoms. We said no. He walked off. We started to order when we called him back and tried to order side dishes as well as mains and rice etc. He said we couldn't do that and had to wait until all side dishes were ordered, which we found strange. After an age of ordering according to his weird system, he began to bark the orders back to us, expecting me to know what everyone had ordered. Naturally, I wasn't sure. This seemed to annoy him. It was 30 minutes between entering the restaurant and finishing ordering. Anyway, he carried on behaving as if we were a burden on his existence all night. We eventually started to find it funny, despite having drinks forgotten about and having to wait 40 minutes for our food to arrive. Maybe he was having a bad day? I don't know. All I do know is that the service we received was pretty shoddy and needless to say we didn't leave the tip which they added on the bill, assuming that we'd pay.",

Jamie tells me that in these restaurants you can bring your own beer, even though they sell beer at the restaurant. i found this surprising. they had cobra, which is an indian beer. do not get this confused with King Cobra 40oz. i'm not sure what the difference was with all the places on brick lane, but it was just like nyc where they have a guy outside to heckle you to come in.",

    "text": "When we went to Sheba for lunch recently, we loved everything about it. The service was really friendly, and unlike some of the other restaurants in Brick Lane, they do very little touting, in fact they are very discreet about it, which we liked. You feel you want to look at the menu, they are so nice about it. We had their special two-course lunch and the food was just fantastic. It was very fresh, fragrant and really well cooked. We almost regretted not to have chosen from the a-la-carte, as we could have happily have eaten much more. We did, in fact, order an extra dish, the Lamb Shank, which is a bit of a house speciality, and we shared this one. Very tender lamb, with spicy carrots and aromatic herbs (we later learnt that the predominant flavour was cardamom, with pine flowers and saffron). We would go back just for this dish, it was so very tasty.",

From the moment that the guy on the door knew my name and was expecting me, Sheba made me feel special. We had a whole double table to ourselves - a luxury in the small Indian restaurants that live cheek by jowl on Brick lane! We were looked after by the head honcho and he really knew his stuff: we let him order for us. And he did really well. The food was amazing - we had:(and I know, because he kindly wrote it down)chicken buna hyderback (great for mild curry lovers like me)lamb lucknow - quite mild and the lamb was sooo tenderchicken shaslik buna - I would have that again too.There was other food, but those were the standout dishes.

It was great, the sauce with it was superb. We also had a lamb shank which was fall off the bone. It was the best fish by far. The chicken curry was also very good - chicken itself was dry but the sauce was very very good. No surprise that they were voted best curry! We also ordered naan and rice. Both were delicious.

    "text": "This is a (maybe?) once great restaurant that was either having a bad day in the kitchen, or has dropped off quite a bit from its previous success. For one, the restaurant had someone posted on the street to shout at people walking by to come eat there. Usually a bad sign if that is necessary. But they offered us a discount off the menu prices, free drinks, and a window seat. And it looked like they had all the normal Indian dishes we liked, so we sat down to give it a shot. Me and a friend both got a half-pint of Cobra beer, which was apparently the only choice for beer. It was cold, but mostly flat. Another friend got the red wine, which was almost undrinkable. Another bad sign when the options are simply \"red\" or \"white.\"The waiter offered us papadums to start, but when I said I'd prefer to have Naan, he said that they do not serve any naan before the food comes out. Ok... \u00a0I didn't press the issue, which was probably a smart move, because when the naan did come out eventually with the meal, it was very bland and doughy. Between the three of us, we ordered Butter chicken, Tikka Masala, Tandoori Chicken, and Chicken Madras. Of those 4 dishes, the Tandoori was not bad, but the other 3 were pretty poor. \u00a0Butter chicken was practically tasteless. I don't just mean it had no spice, it simply had no taste. Tikka masala was similarly bland, and strangely sweet tasting. Maybe this an authentic Indian or UK Indian thing to have sweeter curries than in the US? Either way it was not what we were expecting. The Chicken Madras was fairly spicy as it was supposed to be, but again lacked much taste beyond that. The only part I can say was a delight was the final bill. I can't recall the total, and since it was in pounds my scale of cheap/expensive was probably a little off, but I can definitely say it was about 1/3rd cheaper than what I was expecting, and far cheaper than any of our other meals in London. Later in the trip we went to another Indian restaurant near the British Museum which we enjoyed much more, but was of course more expensive. At the end of the day, we had alcoholic drinks, and plenty of food to fill us up, for a lot less than we expected to pay that night. If you put value for money above outright taste of food, then maybe Sheba is a perfect fit. But since we had limited time on vacation and were expecting \"the best curry in London\", we were pretty disappointed overall. \u00a0The tag line in the yelp rating of \"Meh. I've experienced better\" is a perfect way to describe how we felt after leaving Sheba.",

Foremost of which is that when you get a \"deal\" you in actuality get a smaller, worse curry. Nobody can sell you a decent curry with naan, rice, starter and two beers for \u00a312. We went to brick lane looking specifically for Sheba after it was highly reviewed in a thrillist article. Happily when we rocked up they didn't pester us. I don't think they really need to. Expectations were met, chicken chaat puri was amazing, chicken xakuti (spelling is almost definitely wrong...) was also amazing. They do take their spice seriously though. I mean... Wow. In a good way. I don't know what else to say really... 4 of us with a starter and main, sharing rice and naan between two (and byob) were stuffed for less than \u00a320 each. Definitely worth the extra few quid to get a decent curry (and yes it was bigger). If you're on brick lane for a curry I 100% recommend this place. But I can't guarantee what you'll get if you barter for a \u00a39 curry with beers!",

Our food is good but then we get the bill and we notice some mysterious charges. One was for \u00a310.80. We asked what the charge was and he said it was for the popadoms. We were never told that the popadoms were not complementary and he offered it like it was bread at any other restaurant. Needless to say we were forced to pay \u00a310.80 for six popadoms. Then, my friend ordered a side of Chana masala as her main dish. They gave her the size of a side, but then charged her as if it were the bigger size. We tried arguing this to the waiter but he would not lower the charge. Lastly, I was sorting my change when paying (I'm from America and I had difficulty telling how many pence each coin was worth), and another waiter said \"just look at the numbers it's not that hard.\" Thank you for that truly sage advice.

    "text": "So I was in London and was told that there's really good Indian food in Brick Lane (London's Murray Hill, basically). I was kind of lazy and didn't do my research and decided to just find the place with the most people/longest line (which usually works). Unfortunately, we got there around 6pm and it was too early and no one was really eating yet...there were also lots of hawkers standing outside each restaurant harassing people into trying their resto (offering \"special menus\" and free drinks...all of which I later learned are scams). Anyway...we decided on Sheba (after walking up and down Brick Lane 3x) because they had the most occupied tables.Random anecdote: there was a 20-something Indian guy eating with his dad next to us who interrupted my order to complain about his food. It was pretty uncomfortable as the guy was really sarcastic and angry. He basically said the food was too greasy and that he's Indian so obviously he knows what the food should taste. When asked by the server how the food was, he curtly replied, \"It's awful.\" I actually started laughing and thought he was joking, but he was dead serious. They ate quickly and left. But before he left, he started instigating the server saying stuff like \"you talk a lot for a waiter. do you want me to make a scene? I can make a scene, do you want me to make a scene now?? When you were trained, didn't they teach you to smile.\" It was rather bizarre, but still, we had high hopes for our dinner. So the food is bad. Like REALLY SALTY and watery curry bad. I think any place in Murray Hill would be way better than this AND MUCH CHEAPER. We're talking British Pounds here, people. Two mains, a beer and a mango lassi turned out to be like $80 USD. WTF. Afterwards, I found this Thrillist article that raved about Sheba: thrillist.com/eat/london\u2026(more WTF sentiment). Just don't come here. It sucks.",

    "text": "The worst!!!! Complete Liars!!!  I dined there tonight. As soon as we walked in, I asked the waiter whether it was BYO because I already bought a bottle of wine. The waiter immediately said \"No, we are fully licensed\", I mentioned that I bought a bottle but he said we had to buy alcohol from their menu. I ordered a glass of wine which was totally watered down- I had to complain and order a different glass of wine. Only then, did he pour a glass in front of us (the first one came from downstairs which I would never know what he did with it). Then, a group came in with their own wine and beer. I asked the waiter: Why was it NOT OK for me to bring my own bottle, and it's ok for them? He goes and says, \"we are fully licensed but we allow bottles\" or something like that. I did not have to order their water down filthy wine to begin with! We decided that they don't deserve any tips but guess what? They automatically add their service charge. Total thieves!!!! May I also mention, the restaurant (and I glanced at their kitchen) is absolutely filthy. I'm not even sure who gives all these nice reviews for this restaurant but I am sure it is the people who work for the restaurant reviewed. Food wise, it is absolutely mediocre (I would definitely go somewhere better in bricklane). There are many places on the same street with far better food and service and far far better price (and definitely do not lie right to the face of their customers). Guys, WALK AWAY! These people rip you off!",
