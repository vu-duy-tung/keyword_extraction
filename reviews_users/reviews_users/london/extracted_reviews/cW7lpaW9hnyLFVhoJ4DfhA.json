We queued for quite a while - I overheard \u00a0a couple of people saying that the sundaes didn't work as the flavour of the bean overpowered the matcha, so I decided to simply go for a soft serve cone. I wanted to go for half vanilla, half matcha - I was told I wasn't allowed - although I don't see why not but anywho! I did like the matcha soft serve. Although I think this place is definitely overhyped. They must have to add a lot of sugar for it to mask the bitterness of the matcha, so I can't imagine it's actually that healthy. Don't think I'll be queueing here again any time soon.",

Queue was within the shop. There are not many seat in the shop. Shop was full with customer but only 2 staff were working. One take order and another person prepare the ice cream. The person took a bit long to take an order. I ordered one of the classic matcha sundae and Houjicha Float with vanilla ice cream. I like all the topping on the sundae but I find the matcha taste can be stronger. Houjicha float which I find it quite special. It is crushed ice with Japanese rice tea flavour and top with sundae. Personally I prefer stronger matcha taste so I find Tombo matcha sundae is better. But if you prefer lighter matcha taste then this shop will be perfect for you.",

I have tried the Matcha sundae #2 that comes with a dollop of red beans (my another favourite) in between and 3-4 mini rice balls. \u00a0Not a big fan of the rice balls, too hard to chew and tasteless. I'm a happy camper with anything green tea and red beans, the perfect combination.Back to the ice cream, it is so creamy and perfect flavour, not too bland, not too strong. Of course the price is quite expensive for that small sundae, would be more attractive if the price goes down a bit. \u00a0It was quite packed when we walked in last Monday around noon time, the shop is small to begin with and has limited seating areas. \u00a0Waited for almost 15-20 minutes for my order and finally my order came through... Unfortunately it was watery, my match green tea already melted (gosh!).. Not sure what had happened behind the scene, guess the machine not doing its work as usual. Luckily the lady who serve me apologise to me big time and said please allow her to make me another one. There you go, great customer service always receive a good rating. \u00a0I love how attentive the ladies are, preparing the tea and sundae with a lot of patience and smile. Keep it up and do pop by when you are around SOHO area, London.",

Yes it was slightly disorganised in terms of ordering and payment process. However let's not forget the reason to get excited over the first Matcha soft serve ice-cream in London Soho. We have tried 5 different desserts (from sundae to floats) our favourite is the O-Matcha Sundae. A layered sundae that was absolute heaven. At the bottom is a layer of genmai; crispy toasted rice (what you'd get with genmai tea), next is a layer of red bean paste and topped with a swirl of the matcha soft ice cream. You also get a mini shiratama (glutinous riceball), a sweet preserved chestnut and a crispy waffle. All the different flavours worked so well together and the toasted rice pieces added another texture and depth of flavour to the sundae. Did we mention their matcha ice cream is intensified with matcha flavour while maintaining its smooth creaminess from the ice cream? Yum.",

I didn't particularly care much for the rest of the sundae, as I personally don't like red bean much.

Staff are friendly and service is prompt - we received our order pretty much immediately after placing it, despite the busy hour! Downsides? Small portions and even smaller seating area ... some people had clearly finished their ice cream, but were just ... chilling (no pun intended). Which is cool, except for the fact that there's very limited seating and my friend and I just wanted to stay and chat.

The shop originates in Kyoto so I had high expectations and it didn't disappoint me once I had a spoon full of the matcha sundae with red bean and mochi with kinako powder. The combination was divine despite it being a bit sweet. The ice cream was nice and smooth with no nasty powdery bits that you get sometimes. I'd definitely like to go back, seating is limited but if you're eating ice cream in London winter weather prob best to be eaten indoors! They do have hot matcha drinks as well if you want to take it out :)",

    "text": "Hmmm interesting reviews from other reviewers. Well for one, this is not the first Matcha Soft serve in Soho. Before this we've had Kanada Ya soft serve (who also does sesame) and we've had Shackfuyu's infamous Kinako french toast with matcha soft serve!!!I came here yesterday, and got the matcha Shiromata Sundae. Queue was decent, about 7 min wait, the servers were still slow but seem to be faster than the other reviewers found when the place first opened. There were only two servers though and when you factor this in it's basically one person taking payments and one person doing the ice creams! Wasn't very happy that the person kept saying wait to your payment and goes and dishes out some ice creams and then goes back to taking your payments...Taste-wise, I would say the matcha is not really that strong and compared to the really really sweet red azuki beans and the syrup they poured in there you really didn't have a chance to taste matcha.It was a nice experience, abeit quite expensive at \u00a35+ for a takeaway cup!",

    "text": "Having high expectations that this was a Tsujiri offshoot, I went in with the mistaken belief that the matcha desserts would actually taste like matcha, despite my gut telling me that all Japanese food in London becomes complete rubbish by association [with the food reputation].-- sounds harsh but after squeezing room in a packed itinerary to stop by Tsujiri, I was left in disbelief at how unbelievably bad everything tasted, despite looking promising from the pictures. If you have been to the original Tsujiri in Kyoto, saying that you'll be disappointed by the inauthenticity here is a kind, vast understatement.For one, the only semblance to matcha in any of the drinks or desserts here is on the outside: congrats, you've got the bright green part down. Oscar the grouch (ironically also in a trash can) would be so proud. Question: Why are the parfaits, a.k.a. \"sundaes\" so icy? We couldn't even figure out how to get soft-serve ice-cream, creamy? Not just taste (everything is weirdly sweet in all the wrong places) but textures are really off here. I wish I could actually stop remembering the bland white globs of the supposed \"shiratama dango\" that were still frozen. They are supposed to be chewy soft, not the crunchy flavorless mess you are left gnawing on. The drinks are sadly terrible too. Let's not get started on the failure that is the \"o-matcha cappuccino.\" What an affront to both the tea and coffee industry, simultaneously. A rare one-star rating for actually offending my taste buds and tricking me into thinking that this franchise would live up to its namesake. However, it has always been a dream of mine to use the British phrase: \"completely rubbish\" so thank you for that.",

    "text": "Tsujiri- A pretty new matcha dessert bar opened in Rupert Street selling overpriced soft whipped matcha ice cream, floats and desserts. But the satisfaction you get is priceless. I love the bright modern contemporary decor. It's airy and bright keeping to the white and green theme of its vanilla and matcha flavoured desserts. Although I do hope they open up a bigger branch soon as there is very limited seats and space making it very cramp and hard to navigate in and out of the place.Personally I would avoid visiting for ice cream when it rains as you might end up eating it outside in the rain. Ren had to stand opposite to where I was sitting as although there was an empty space at the table, there was no seat there. Bad organisation.Service was friendly at least. We decided to get two very different matcha flavours desserts to try more of the menu. They do hot drinks and hot desserts too but we weren't interested that day as the sun was out.Yuzu O-matcha floatI did love that strong sweet sour citrus taste of the yuzu. It had a nice subtle hint of bitterness too making it all very refreshing. However I didn't believe the matcha float was a good pair as the acidity starting to eat away at the ice cream breaking down the milk protein from the water content, making it lose its milkiness and instead created little blobs of protein to float around. Not a beautiful sight.The matcha ice cream was amazing though before it melted into the yuzu. It was incredibly smooth and creamy on the tongue as it melted yet very light unlike regularly ice cream that can be sickly. The matcha flavour was strong enough to taste it but blended in milk and cream, the bitterness was balanced out. Very pricey for a large at \u00a35.95 and no where near as impressive as the sundae coming up next.O-matcha chiffon cake sundaeI would definitely get this again but at \u00a34.95 it would probably be a well deserved treat as it was pretty small. The lovely soft milky matcha ice cream soaking into the pandan cake created a lovely saturated spongy texture, bringing in the matcha flavour to the pandan. The red bean paste aided in a nice sweetness as well as a more dense and fluffy texture to give it some substance. Cornflakes was a thoughtful idea to add a nice light crunch to it. Delightful!I'm very happy that matcha desserts has finally made its way into London and slowly becoming a trend. Tsujiri is very authentic and the closest in both texture and taste compared to the ones I've had in Japan. At the moment it's a bit hectic due to it being new and trending and also because of its small space. Hopefully they will open another branch soon with more seating area.",

    "text": "Tsujiri is a Japanese traditional tea brand which serves its matcha (green tea) tea in variety of desserts and drinks. It is originated in Japan and has branches in other part of the world i.e. Singapore, Canada....The London shop is small which is located in the Soho. There are only a few seats which are usually filled during the busy hours. But when there is so many people it can get stuffy that you would rather just eat on the street.Tsujiri is popular for their soft serve ice cream which comes in two flavours, Matcha (\u00a33.95) or Vanilla (\u00a33.45) in either a cone or cup. You can also opt to add toppings for additional charge - Kinako (roasted soy beans powder), Red Bean, Kuromitsu (dark sugar syrup), Shiratama (mochi), Marron Glace (sugar syrup chestnut candied).If you want some thing a bit more fancy than the Matcha Sundae is a good choice. There are three to choose, Crispy Sundae (\u00a34.95), Shiratama Sundae (\u00a35.45) and Chiffon Cake Sundae (\u00a34.95).The Chiffon Cake Sundae consist of corn flakes, a piece of green tea chiffon cake, red bean paste and of course matcha soft-serve ice cream.If you are like me who some time want a drink but still want an ice cream than the float (Small \u00a35.45/Medium \u00a35.95) is a good option. There are six to choose, O-matcha float, Houjicha float, Yuzu float, O-matcha milk float, Houjicha milk float and Red bean float. All of them comes with a choice of vanilla or matcha ice cream. It is definitely a good choice to get cool in the warm weather.There are also a variety of drinks including hot or cold ice tea and latte. For some thing to cool down in the warm weather but more on the icy side than the ice blended (Medium \u00a33.95/Large \u00a34.45) could be the one.",

The matcha ice cream is very smooth with strong match flavour (extremely hard to find!), the shaved ice is also matcha flavoured and both have just the right level of sweetness!

The shop offered a variety of choices, it has fresh tea; ice blended; latte; matcha/ vanilla float; sundae; cone ice cream and shaved ice. I personally not into matcha(green tea pwder) that much although it seem to get very popular in this shop. I tried the vanilla taste of sundae instead.it called shiratama sundae which cost about \u00a34.95 compare to mc donald sundae only \u00a31.29. The matcha shiratama cost \u00a35.45. Only difference is the red bean and the topping. The price is over the top but the portion serving is too small and yet it attract a lot of Chinese students to hanging out here. Even the cone soft ice cream cost \u00a33.95. I guess it new opening and summer season draw the crowd in. I guess it will take me a long time to revisit the shop again. And most of my friends agree that it is hard to earn my money .",

The matcha flavor is strong and delicious! Within this cup of sundae is also a ton of other flavors and textures from the red bean paste, wafer, mochi, chestnut and rice puffs at the bottom. I loved getting a bit of everything in each spoonful!The prices are also pretty standard for the area. If you love matcha, then you need to check this place out!",

    "text": "I love this place! I've tried it before in Taiwan and no other dessert place has as strong of a matcha flavor as this chain.I always order the sundaes because I love the texture combination of soft serve, mochi, and puffed rice. Even the waffle thats printed with Tsujiri on the top of the soft serve tastes delicious. The soft serve itself is creamy, delicious, and bright in flavor. Both the Matcha and the Houjicha are great flavors. You can now get two flavors in one sundae so I recommend doing that if you want to try each one!Overall, I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for an Asian dessert! I've never been to another dessert place that tastes so naturally match flavored as this store,",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to coming here especially after seeing the large menu of all matcha based items. I felt I couldn't go wrong, but perhaps I took a slight wrong turn somewhere.The afternoon rush seemed to quiet as I ordered so I was able to find a window seat. It took nearly 10 minutes for my order to be ready. Again, there were no other orders but mine. They called out it was ready. Really? One of the three staff couldn't bring it out to me?When I went over I noticed that my medium size had doubled into what I can assume was the large. It was a giant bowl and it was steaming hot. I asked the staff for a tray and after looking for one, he just said he would bring it out. Apparently more skilled than I was at carrying hot bowls of tea.The presentation was great but after a few sips once it cooled, it was clear that bigger isn't always better. The tea to milk ratio was low and I knew I wouldn't be able to finish the drink. I needed more flavour, more umph! The other menu items look very appealing should I be back but with other matcha tea makers in the neighbourhood, that won't be anytime soon.",

Finally legit, authentic matcha has arrived in central London. It's really, really good!I had the Shiromata Sundae, which was delicious! And I also got a matcha soft serve in a cup. Also delish! Perfectly sweet, with a nice, rich and smooth matcha flavour. Definitely come and get some soon.I almost knocked a star off though because this place is really small and I couldn't get a spot to sit. Never fear! You can walk 3 minutes, one block away to the courtyard of Ham Yard Hotel and sit on a bench outside. Problem solved!This place gets so busy. There was a long line out the door and I had to queue for about 10 minutes. Totally worth it though! I can't wait to come back.",

We were walking through the Chinatown and Soho area of London and walked by Tsujiri and wanted to give it a shot. I was pretty thirsty and like a good matcha latte, so it seemed like a good fit since they seem to \"specialize\" in matcha. The matcha latte was a bit lacking I felt. It was on the bland side and it did not have that strong of a matcha flavor to it. I was a bit disappointed since I have definitely tried much better matcha lattes. If you must stop by, it seems the soft serve looks a lot better and that is what most people were having so I would give that a try and the latte a pass.",

You could feel the stress - but there's no need for it! Tusjiri has really yummy matcha green tea ice cream and other great desserts! I ordered the Tsujiri sundae which was good - however in the future I may skip out on all the topping stuff. I felt the red bean paste was so sweet it masked the light matcha flavor of the ice cream. Next time I'll just be getting a soft-serve; this could come down to personal preference!",

Also in terms of price, it's pretty equal when comparing sundaes across competitors (Milk Train, Chin Chin labs, Udderlicious, ... other ice cream places in soho).",
