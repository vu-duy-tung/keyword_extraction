On a cold October night that is.It was heaving at 7pm, but what did we expect? It's the City. Low lighting, a bit too low really, and some high tables that we couldn't get close to for the masses. Very industrial and Meat-Packing district.The seating area for the restaurant looked cozy and inviting - I think if I come back here again it'll be to try the food. I've heard good things (and Chris was clearly impressed). Perhaps it'll be more an inviting place on a quieter night - because at with that many people squeezed in and \u00a34 pint prices, it just felt like another City twat-bar.To be continued...",

My goodness, if I wasn't in the most \"it\" after work bar ever, I'm not sure what it was. Luckily, they have a set up that caters to a range of crowds, so there's standing room for you and your work buddies with long tables by the bar, a restaurant bit if you want to sneak away from the action, and they're going to license for a larger outside standing area I've been told so you'll be able to flow out to the streets and soak in a bit of sun if you've been trapped inside all day. The cocktails were great, and they even have a \"skinny\" cocktail range complete with calorie guide for those that can take the accountant out of work but not the work out of the accountant and are keen to count up and keep tally on their health goals. Personally, I'll take my calories where I can get them and went with a mango mojito, and sipped my friends botanist (cucumbery and refreshing!), which were both quite reasonable at around 5.95 a pop considering cocktails around here can easily climb into the 7's and 8's. I saw some boards of potato wedges fly by my face and I've made the pact to venture \u00a0back down and try some food when they're less busy.",

    "text": "Quick glance:+ inexpensive meals+ great for big group+ open kitchen- clumsy service- heavy, wooden platter as plates I came to this modern gastropub with my colleagues for lunch. We pre-booked a table for 8 and were seated at what looked like the chef's table right by the open plan kitchen. This usually speaks well of the quality of cooking. The restaurant is massive and had around 150 patrons on Friday lunchtime. Pre-booking is not absolutely necessary, but recommended for weekday lunch given its central location to City offices. I ordered the potted pork with homemade mustard and toast for my starter, a reinvented east London classic. It was unfortunate that there was only one portion remaining and one of my colleagues who also ordered this dish conceded and had to pick something else. Five of the eight starters arrived together, but it was another 5 minutes before the remaining three arrived (after we questioned the waiter), reflecting poorly on the service. The starters were interestingly presented. Some had the chicken satay, which came in Chinese bamboo dim sum trays lined with lettuce. Another had the \"prawn lollipops\" which were whole prawns skwered on bamboo sticks. The taste of my starter, however, did not match up to the visual appeal. The potted pork itself lacked seasoning, and the homemade mustard lacked kick. For main, I had the rib eye steak cooked medium rare, which comes with side salad and chips. I replaced my chips with the truffled chips with parmesan and rosemary, and I also ordered a peppercorn sauce for my steak. The dish (like any other dishes ordered at the restaurant) comes on heavy, wooden platter that serves as plates. While it is novel, they take up a lot of room and made the meal for 8 rather cosy despite the big table. Because the platters are flat, sauces cannot be poured over the food so my peppercorn sauce had to be used as a dip. The steak was cooked to perfection, although the chips with extra goodies were lacking imagination, as though the sous chef had forgotten to prep the dish and went for a last minute sprinkle of parmesan, rosemary and truffle oil over a small cauldron of chips. For dessert, I had the chili chocolate martini which came in a decorated martini class and had the consistency of a chocolate milkshake, with a slight hint of chili that was rather nice. With 3 courses and about half a bottle of wine for each diner, the bill came to roughly \u00a340 a head which is good value given the amount of food we had at such a central location as the heart of the City of London. The service was quite clumsy, though, with at least 3 occassions where the waiting staff had knocked over or dropped items near our table, with small collateral damage suffered by my boss's shiny black shoes at some point. (I wonder if that had impacted the price of our meal?) The quality of ingredients is commendable and presentation appealing, but the dishes themselves were mediocre. I would recommend it for large group as it had great atmosphere and good lighting, especially throughout the rest of the venue which had tall tables and booths chairs.",

There's a huge selection on the menu and it really takes me absolutely forever to decide on what to order, before working my charm on my friends to persuade them to order whatever else I am craving!It's a really great place for big groups before the night continues in the area, they have these mahousive tables akin to fancy canteen benches back in the day. The only downside of having dinner there is that it's absolutely huge and drinks are held just next to the table - so it's packed to bits after work with all the city workers and everyone is getting near to screaming down their neighbour's ear especially with the music going up a couple of notches every 30 minutes. Also like another yelper noted before, the food is served on wooden slabs - having ribs on a slippery gooey sauce after a few large glasses of wine ends up to be quite a messy task. Ditch the cutlery and dig in with your hands, it's too crowded to notice the lack of table manners!Having been there for clubbing also, I can definitely vouch for that as well. I love how they play R&B and hiphop, one of the rare gems in London! Drinks are a tad expensive, but definitely less than some other clubs in London. The crowd was really good - definitely well dressed but the atmosphere was chilled and everyone was there just for a good time rather than people watching.So yes, it was love at first sight and I am definitely going back for more!",

    "text": "Attended a hen night at The Anthologist in summer 2010. You need to call in advance to book a seating area and pay a (refundable) deposit of around \u00a350. The entry process to the club was rather annoying \u00a0we got there very early and there was barely anyone inside the club, yet they made a real thing about making us stand around and letting only one member of our group go in at a time as if the place was SO busy they wouldn't be able to handle more than one customer at a time. Everyone had to have their names checked off a list and they just took ages finding each name! We had booked a seating area for 16 people. Once the whole group was inside, we were escorted to our seating area and shown where our tables/seats were. The bar was close to where we sat and the prices were reasonable considering it's a central London venue. The music was fabulous all night \u00a0good 80s and 90s dance music and the evening went really well apart from one niggle. The seating was such that we had several tables and a corner seat. The people sitting on the next batch of tables to us seemed to be quite miserable and complained to the management that we had overflowed into their seats which was rather odd as we had been told where we could sit. We didn't realise it was almost a criminal offence to overspill slightly and we were scolded quite severely for not sitting in the right seats. It would have been understandable had the other group actually had enough people to use all of their seating but they didn't. This incident almost put a dampener on our mood but we ensured everyone in our group knew not to make the same mistake during the evening \u00a0unfortunately it didn't stop the other group glaring at us for the rest of the evening. Overall we had a very enjoyable evening \u00a0music was great and drinks priced such that it didn't break the bank although I'd add that the bar staff could do with paying a bit more attention to which customers have been waiting to be served the longest. Visited more recently (Feb 2012) and found it amazing that they kept us waiting outside in the freezing cold (and it was snowing) for 20 minutes after the opening time without giving any apology or explanation. The music was not as good as the previous time I'd visited and although we had reserved a fairly large table for our group of 30, we found the bar staff were constantly swiping drinks from our table which were still half full, once when I actually stopped one of the staff who'd picked up a drink and said it wasn't finished, he gave it back with no apology but as he'd had his fingers in the glass when picking it up, I waved him away with the glass. This collecting of glasses with drinks in was extremely annoying \u00a0you can't basically stand guard at both ends of a table when most of your pals are dancing and who wants to make a fuss in the middle of a club about this happening? This has basically put me off wanting to go there again. Rating changed from 3 out of 5 to 2 out of 5.",

But the service was noticeably slow and maybe it's just me but they lost me a bit when they served the food - I am usually all for interesting presentation, but when I'm paying a tenner for a burger and chips I wasn't really charmed by the small plastic school dinners style tray it arrived on (not that I'm a snob honest, but where do you put the ketchup?!). Luckily it tasted good (though most things do when they're topped with blue cheese mmm), and scampi looked like another good choice for next time (served in a basket on a plank of wood).

    "text": "The Anthologist is a pretty decent bar that has a few key things going for it: 1) it's open on the weekends when the rest of the City turns into a dead zone, 2) it has live music (DJs and bands) on Saturday nights and 3) the drinks are sold at only mildly outrageous prices compared to the standard ridiculousness.I've been a few times (and been a slacker on reviewing it) so I'm going to aggregate those experiences into one write up. During the week, the Anthologist is a pretty good place to go for a bite to eat and catch up with a friend or have an awkward first date (I've done both). Food wise, you are limited to the staples with nothing really special. They have a full bar and cocktail list but I've found the bartenders to be hit or miss depending on who you get. I think they may also have a fairly high turnover as I've never seen the same person twice, but then again after a few drinks everyone looks like a very similar blur.Saturday nights, especially those hosted by London Groove, are pretty sweet with live music (usually RnB or something similarly mainstream) blasting out a bespoke sound system. The line at the bar tends to be short as they up the staffing level which I definitely appreciate. It's a mixed bag of people with some nights being a sea of brown faces and others the typical mix for London.I would note that you should aim to get in before 11 and they will still charge you a \u00a310 cover most weekends. Also, if you leave (not to smoke, but say to run down the street for cash or locate a friend), they rarely let you back in which I find uber annoying!Overall, a good place to keep in mind if you live near the City and don't want to trek to the West End.",

The indoors area is huge (I don't even know how to describe it... it can definitely fit at least 150 people), and there are plenty of tables for groups to sit and drink, or even nibble on some food. I was hungry so I ordered some chips at the bar, and I only had to wait like 2 minutes before a waitress brought a fresh order over, and they were some pretty decent chips! The service was surprisingly fast, given that the place was packed. I was only with one other friend, so we went outside to enjoy our food/drinks, and the entire pavement was like an extension of the bar and we grabbed a seat at one of their outdoor tables (that have blankets on the back of the chairs!). When we went in for our second drink, they had started playing club music, but the crowds had started thinning out (about quarter to eight-ish). I have a friend who said she went here on a date... in my opinion, this place is too busy/crazy/packed for a date, but perfect for after-work drinks!",

Sometimes I wish I was working closer to this place so getting there on a Friday night wouldn't require a cab.It's nice and straightforward City drinking place. It has decent cocktail menu with reasonable London prices. They are farily quick in serving them too - about 5 minutes waiting time - they have a few bartenders and only once I had to wait 20 minutes, but that's life.I had my birthday drinks here too - and I booked a whole lounge area + table in the restaurant. I would strongly recommend this place for events like that - you can book as large or as small are as you need - they have a variety of those. The food is nice too and very decently priced for its taste, the location of the place and the setting as well.The crowd is - well...City peeps. I would therefore definitely recommend Thursday and Friday nights if you like that kind of people, I'm one of them - so I like it :)I was told that this is the same owner as The Folly, but to be honest, it's neater than Folly and a bit more upscale - so I like it more.",

I had a vegetarian pasta dish, which was tasty and combined some cool flavors. The bar was a blast! Lots of fun dancing and interesting people.

It's a great after-work haunt in the City, which, from my experience, is the least City-ish. Good selection of cocktails served in quirky ways, but honestly the wine list is better. It is beautifully designed and very comfortable, even the toilets look chic!The menu is varied and crowd-pleasing, and you can't really go wrong. The sharing flatbreads are great and a good first call if everyone is hungry (should have ordered two!). The main event here is probably the steak options, which are quite to die-for. My favourite eating experience here was the 'champagne surf and turf' with lobster, steak and glass of bubbly, which was phenomenal but sadly just a limited-time special. YES, it does get rammed, mainly immediate after work drinks on Wednesdays-Fridays. I always book a table in advance (easy to do and very welcoming when you arrive) if I'm bringing a large group or wanting dinner.",

The large group tables in the middle of the dining area use a combination of armchairs and park benches.I found the service to be very good. They're clearly well drilled in large lunchtime groups.The menu has a wide range of international dishes, which means it caters for most tastes. They are trying to present the food in an interesting way but it feels a bit dated now. Thankfully my burger came on a plate (somebody must have read Sanj M's review), but the chips were in a plant pot. The food tastes good and the Roman fires are are delicious upgrade from normal chips.If you like The Folly or The Happenstance you're sure to like this place",

To make things worse, I found a few bits of ham in there...probably accidentally transferred from a previous dish they were making. The dish also came with some toasted plain white bread...given the price point and appearance of this place, I would have expected something better, or at least a choice of something a little healthier and less artificial. In sum, the dish looked and tasted like it could have been served at some second-rate diner. The two stars are for the flat white, which was actually good - nice flavour, not bitter, and the perfect temperature. Service was underwhelming - no one ever checked on us, our water was never refilled, and it took us a while to track down someone for the bill.",

    "text": "I would not be opposed to going back for another meal or even just drinks, but I wouldn't be devastated if I didn't make it back. \u00a0If I were just rating on the ambiance of the place, it would get five stars because it is a nice setting. \u00a0It is rather large inside, so you don't feel like you are sitting on top of each other. \u00a0The lighting was a bit too dark and reading the menu was a bit problematic. \u00a0The decor is nice, but beware, sometimes the plants on the table catch fire from the candles on the table... true story.The menu has a nice variety of interesting dishes as well as some staples. \u00a0And the price is reasonable, more toward the inexpensive side of the spectrum. \u00a0We had made a reservation and to be honest, the staff were really flexible when I had changed it a few times and it even changed when we showed up. \u00a0I chose to have the Crispy Duck Noodle Salad. \u00a0Everyone else at the table seemed to be pleased with their food (Fish Finger Sandwich - 'a bit posh', antipasto sharing platters, flatbread, risotto, and another sandwich). \u00a0I thought the presentation was cute: \u00a0a box on a big wood platter.The crispy duck was awesome, but the noodle salad itself could've used more seasoning and dressing. \u00a0I still enjoyed the food, but if I were to go back, I'd choose a different dish. \u00a0The toilets are nice... even candy is available. \u00a0The restaurant part of the place did not seem quite as busy as the bar area. \u00a0It seemed to be popular for after-work drinks. \u00a0Overall, it was a nice and inexpensive dinner.",

    "text": "A crazy crowded bar full of local bankers and businessmen. \u00a0Great drinks, from a selection of wines to cocktails. \u00a0It is not a place to go for a date as it's too loud and you'll be waiting at the bar for a while to grab your drinks. \u00a0But if you want a lively place, full of interesting people, then this is the place to go.If you reserve a place to stand or sit, then it's a much better option, as a waitress will come to serve you there. \u00a0Otherwise it is a tad impossible and I'd suggest grabbing a few drinks at a time.It's a decent place for breakfast or lunch, though not the cheapest or best in town. \u00a0Still, it's a fun place to go with a group to hang out for a drink after work.",

    "text": "My former manager from my former employer was visiting London, so I took her out to lunch near my current workplace. \u00a0I chose Anthologist, because it looked reasonably fancy and the menu seemed balanced for any taste as well; my guess turned out to be right.I ordered the crab and crayfish linguini, and it hit the spot. \u00a0There was plenty of crab and crayfish to make the meal fulfilling, and the pasta was done just right as well. \u00a0My former manager got fish and chips, and she said hers was good as well. \u00a0On a different note, the ambience was both cute and sophisticated, making it appropriate for a reasonably important lunch meet-ups. \u00a0Last but not least, I thought the service was acceptable with the waitress coming to ask if we needed anything else at least twice throughout our meal.Overall, I highly recommend the place for nice lunches and/or lunch meetings near Bank and Moorgate.",

It usually gets pretty packed on weekday especially on Thursday and Friday but the staff there are very friendly and some super attractive ones! They have some good bar food as well with lots of space on the restaurant area. The music is great here and people can stand outside on a summers day. Definitely a good hang out place for city workers and a pleasant one even for a large group because space is definitely what they've got!",

    "text": "The Anthologist bar and restaurant is tucked away near the gorgeous Guildhall, a Roman amphitheatre and a 17th century place of worship (the Lord Mayor of London's official church). The area is steeped in history being the location of the great fire of London in 1666. Here you have an area where the old truly meets the new. Catering to the drinking and eating needs of investment bankers and the like, pops up The Anthologist. This is a solid after work celebration and party venue. If you want quiet and calm, this is not the place for you. After work guys and dolls line the street outside the venue when it is warm, but also the big bar area. The restaurant is full of groups having fun. Perhaps not best for a first date the latter part of the week, as the room is full of good looking singles. Too much temptation for a Tinder nation. The drinks are great, the food is good. The staff are a key element though, with gorg gals as you come in, a hot Bar Manager, a General Manager who is a bit of a sort and we had the pleasure of the Area Manager making an appearance, again lush. What is it with this co, is it part and parcel that you need to be appealing enough to appear on the menu too? Well as I am spoken for, I will let someone else select one of these dishes, but food and drink wise, a big yes for me. In particular they have some great bar snacks such as prawn lollipops, flatbread with crispy duck flatbread cucumber, spring onion and hoisin. We also enjoyed a mezze board with bulgur wheat salsa, hummus, baba ghanoush, harissa, pickled chillies and olives. \u00a0As the evening draws on, you get to enjoy some good tunes to throw some shapes at. Simple harmless fun is what this Drake & Morgan establishment promises and delivers.",

    "text": "I've only ever been to the Anthologist for work drinks on a Thursday or Friday evening. On these nights it's packed with city suits so unfortunately turns into just another soul-less watering hole. If you're planning drinks for a Weds-Fri night it's imperative to reserve an area in advance, and note that the areas are often on the small side in comparison to the group size. We've previously been given an area for 40 people (the agreed number) that was only suitable for 20 max. I won't deliberately avoid The Anthologist, but it's not a favourite either.",

Service was prompt and attentive. Food was delicious. I had a Chicken Club Sandwich and my co-diner had an oriental- style beef salad with noodles. Desserts were awesome - I especially liked my White Chocolate and Raspberry Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was served in a dainty porcelain tea cup - as I said, cute!Will definitely come back again and try more dishes before awarding a 5* .",
