The bar is very trendy with modern decor but with some elements of the old fire station remaining inside. The fire station is sectioned into a bar area & restaurant area & there is seating outside for the smokers or people who just want to take in the sights of waterloo road.The only thing I dislike about this place is that there are a lot of people who can make a nuisance of themselves by asking you for money or ciggarettes. It's not really a problems with the pub per se, just a minor issue with the location.",

Ive eaten here too, and if you go for old faves such as burgers and chips, nachos, etc - servings are usually more than generous. Had the salmon salad here though once, and at \u00a310 I did expect something more than 1 salmon fillet and the equivalent of one mini gem lettuce with some dressing. Bit nouveau cuisine and Im more an advocate for price reflecting what you get.......maybe Im just greedy! Cool venue for after works drinks and socialising. Good place to meet friends as well as it's right next to Waterloo Stn, so even if you dont know London that well, you cant miss it!",

So clearly it's popular. I've been a few times, and it's okay. There never seems to be enough seats though. Service was fine. One gripe I do have about it is the price. Once I went for roast dinner, and whilst it was nice, it was pretty pricey. A bit over the top for what you got I felt. But if you dont mind that, then it's definately worth a visit.",

It took forever for them to figure out what table to give us even though the place was half empty. It took another eternity for our server to come to our table. We had to ask for a drink menu. They didn't \"do\" what seemed like a third of the listed draughts. I ordered a Hackney Brew APA that the server suggested as a substitute for one of the missing draughts, which tasted like soap (Not sure if I can blame them for this). Long wait to get the beer, of course. While we waited, another server mistakenly tried to take our order. Our food was bland. Two different servers dropped and broke drinking glasses while we were there, I'm guessing from tripping over their own shoelaces since no one was near them when they stumbled. Come on! And to top it all off, our server helped herself to a tip by not bringing us our change back. Maybe this is standard practice in London? It was so terrible that it became comical. It was as if it was all of the employees' first day and they all seemed high. I'm never going back to this joint. Stay away!",

    "text": "The Fire Station, Waterloo (Invited Review) (published 15th July 2015)The Fire Station, Waterloo - The Fire Station menu consists of burgers and pizzas. And your vegetarian friend will not be alienated with the mushroom burger as a possibility. Their pizzas had the thinnest crispiest base; not bulked with stodgy bread. A side of extra carbohydrates in the form of garlic or tomato bread are available, if you wish to fill up later. It was an easy choice to pick from the menu but if you decide to have the beef burgers they are served well-cooked; there is no option as to how you want the meat cooked. I was not impressed considering that the menu is similar to that of a fast food burger chain, The Fire Station, is more upmarket, serves booze and provided service - so I would have expected a little more attention to how my piece of meat is cooked. Like I said, it did not take us long to decide and the food too, was served quite immediately.With Ivy, Sharmin and Jeremy we were already tucking in to the first burger - buttermilk fried chicken with spicy mayo, spicy coleslaw and little gem \u00a38.50. Forgotten the very much needed picture!glazed short rib 6 oz dry aged beef patty, balsamic glazed short rib, American mustard mayo, sliced beef tomato, little gem \u00a310.95 - the short rib looked dry but was indeed quite moist and slighlty sweet. The bun however was not such a good choice for that price. black and gold 6 oz dry aged beef patty, black pudding, double cheese, american mustard mayo, sliced beef tomato, little gem \u00a39.95 - the burger was very tasty, but given the choice, I would have preferred it medium-rare. Unfortunately, the black pudding was a bit overwhelmed by the other flavours but all round a pretty decent burger.smoked mackarel, king prawns, confit garlic butter base, marinated mozarella, mascarpone, rocket, soft boiled egg \u00a312.50 - when I saw those lovely plump prawns, I am beginning to regret ordering a burger. It was possibly the thinnest pizza base I have ever seen. It was very crispy and was lovely with the different softer textures as the topping.The wine menu was small but had interesting selection of wine. Our bottle of French from Bordeaux had the Saint Emilion Grand Cru appellation. The Bordeaux is a French wine region which has enough sub-divisions of appellation that make my head spin, especially after a few glasses of wine! This wine was quite full bodied with deep crimson colour and was very easy to drink. Definitely a good French wine and at \u00a345.00 per bottle, I thought, was quite well priced. The cocktails (from \u00a38.25), beers, ales and cider menu (from \u00a3 4.50) had more variety. Prosecco from \u00a35.00 per glass to a bottle at \u00a3125.00.The building was so iconic, it did not need a front door number. Location was great and easy to find. You will definitely recognise it. Just in case you have not seen enough photos of it, here you go. Come out of Waterloo station turn right on to Waterloo Road and the building is on your right. I like the interior very much. Parts of the building were retained and put to good use. It gives a trendy and classy edge to the interior. Service was very friendly, and it was not just to us. The food was on the mediocre side but the front of house team made the evening so welcoming that I am marking The Fire Station as a possible place to meet friends in Central London for a quick catch up. If the music had been less upbeat and slightly quieter, I would have stayed longer for puddings and drinks. On Thursday evening, The Fire Station was packed. It was only just opened and was very humble to say that they were still trying things out. But I am sure they must have done this before because they handled the evening quite brilliantly. It was quite a rarity to find four people greeting you as you came in through the doors. Ushers were definitely quite handy for the sizable fire station. \u00a0What I thought would be better was if the history of The Fire Station was more augmented. I don't really know the history of the building is but I'm sure that there is an interesting story to tell.",

My standards aren't insane and I don't expect a ton from a restaurant, but I have never had a worse restaurant experience in my life. If I could give zero stars I would.Here are the lowlights:1.) There was a mouse scurrying around the dining room floor - not kidding. We had to tell our waiter.2.) The food was terrible, and especially considering the price we paid. Starter of tempura soft shell crab - have never had tempura so greasy in my life. Main of sea bass - only flavor was the pesto they smeared all over the plate. Broccoli was overdone as was the 'lobster' they had with it. Terrine was at best grey and flavorless.3.) Brought the wrong wine.4.) Slow to take our order.5.) And on top of it all we paid \u00a355 for it. I will never go back here and would advise anyone reading this review to do the same.

Well, I guess I am in SW1.Pretty good chips (this is where the 2nd star comes from). Cold dyed mushy peas. Indifferent, slightly fishy-in-the-this-might-be-a-bit-old fsh, thick, flavourless batter. Had to ask for vinegar for chips. Twice.After I'd finished, I mentioned I was in a bit of a time crunch (had an hour, but was limping, so wanted to make sure I had loads of time), so could I get the bill with my coffee.20 minutes later, I'd paid my bill, including coffee (and a generous tip) but hadn't gotten the coffee.10 minutes later, I went to the bar and asked for the coffee that I'd ordered and was waiting for.10 minutes later, coffees were delivered to 3 tables around me and I asked that the coffees be refunded.

It's a large bar with high ceilings, plenty of seating and a dedicated restaurant area at the rear.We visited around 10pm on a Friday night - a time when you would expect any and every bar to be busy. It was actually half-empty, which we should have taken as a hint. It had a rather aggressive atmosphere - everyone in there was still intent on pushing through the sparse crowd. The bar staff were inattentive and slow. Barman decided to keep my 10p change of his own accord. Nice to see Sipsmiths gin behind the bar but it was then ruined in a warm glass with postmix tonic. Not overly impressed and I'll make an effort not to be visiting again.",

My friends ordered snacks and easily spent upwards of \u00a330 on ciabatta, parma ham and cheeses. It was convenient since it was right next to Waterloo, but next time I'm in a wine mood and near the Eye, I'm heading to Benugo's wine bar in the BFI where it's a bit more memorable, adorable, and the same price.",

I ordered a smacked salmon pizza, which was sooo yumski! This is a late post so I do not recall exactly what was on it. But the crust was thin and crispy and the salmon was smoked perfectly! Light and filling!! I also had a very yummy cocktail, which, of course I cannot recall the name. But it had elderflower and I believe gin and some berries of some sort. I remember it being SO amazing, I sent a picture of it to my BYF (Best Yelp Friend) back in the states. I've attached this picture to this review. I gave it \u00a03 stars because the service was not that great.",

They were sweeter than I was expecting but they were great. They come in various sizes. I had the burger with bacon and it was decent as far as burgers go.

I spent about \u00a39 ( $13 burger).And \u00a3 2 \u00a0($3) for regular cut fries. But I think they get a lot of business because it is right next to Waterloo station and the place is cool- a converted fire station. The fries were greasy and the burger was a bit sloppy. The place can be extremely loud too. But the service was excellent. The staff was fast and very welcoming. And they served my stout just perfect- chilled glass, with very little head. Nothing too fancy here but I'd go back if I was looking to satisfy my hunger.",

The outside of the building is stunning, the decor inside is minimalist although quirky with lights on the end of fire hoses etc, the staff are friendly and the food and drinks menu are good... AND did I mention it used to be a fire station?I met a friend after work for a drink and some food and I can 100% say I'd be back. The food menu is simple with a choice of burgers, pizza and chips. We shared a pizza with chips and salad (although changed our order after 5 minutes and they were very accommodating). The pizza was good with a crisp base and plenty of toppings, served with a huge salad and a mix of fries and sweet potato fries. Overall entirely satisfying but nothing out of this world. The cocktails are lovely - well presented and refreshing but at over \u00a38 a pop with no happy hour it rapidly increases the bill!We were seating in the bar area, which had a nice buzz - busy for mid week but not too loud that you couldn't hear the other person. They also have a proper dining room which was much quieter. Overall simple yet effective!",

They still had a few tables in the restaurant in the back though. So, this place used to be a fire station, as the name suggests, and it's decorated with a lot of fire fighter related materials. For example the ceiling lights hang from old fire hoses!I really liked the atmosphere, though it's a bit on the noisy side.All of us ordered pizza, so that's the only food item I can review. It was really good, with a thin and crispy crust and fruity sweet tomato sauce. The toppings were a bit sparse, but very tasty.

    "text": "So we headed here tonight to check out the Christmas menu. I already loved the idea of the venue - an old renovated fire station - and I was very excited about going along to check it out.It's located perfectly by Waterloo Station and opposite The Old Vic. On arrival, the place was heaving and it continued to be so throughout the evening - a good sign.The venue itself is just brilliant and designed so well - they have taken care in its renovation to keep the structure of the station building and there are also a number of hidden beauties including an old mini gold fire hydrant. Also if you head into the restaurant area you'll find the lighting above, which is made from old fire hoses. A ingenious touch. Now to the food - boy did they fill us up. We started with their special starter - chilli and caramelised chicken wings. They were delightful. The sweet taste of caramel gelled so well with the tang of the chilli - I'd actually eat just a whole bowl of the sauce. It's safe to say manners went out of the window and licking the sauce off my fingers was the only way to go.Next the pizza, we actually tried the smoked mackerel and prawn pizza first - to say I'm not a big fan of mackerel would be an understatement but I sucked it up and gave the pizza try. It was delicious - both types of fish were more meaty then fishy and the flavours complimented each other perfectly. I would actually order this pizza if I went back which really says something! Then to the Christmas pizza - pure genius. It was topped with pork and sage stuffing balls, chestnuts, cranberry sauce and crispy parsnip swirls. Now I've had a lot of Christmas burgers in my time but never a Christmas pizza and I can honestly say this isn't a pizza to look over. If you can, get down there and try it. The base is crispy the combination of toppings just works and it's a taste sensation in your mouth! NOW, the burgers! Yes, I'm serious. We ate this much food! What can I say, I'm running out of positive descriptive words. We tried the black and gold burger and the Christmas burger and both were fully loaded and packed full of flavour. I actually preferred the black and gold as I'm a meaty person and the burger was cooked to perfection but I would also definitely recommend the Christmas burger.Lastly we had a bite of the warm chocolate brownie. It literally melted in your mouth and I have no doubt would taste great with ice cream. So after all the food all we could to was roll quietly out of the place but we had to make a pit stop at the bar and try a smoked cocktail. I went opted for the smoked cherry Manhattan - it was good, not great as it's not my usual beverage but I supped it up and went on my merry way (literally merry - it was very strong). The only real negative I have is that this is a very busy and loud place so I couldn't really hear or speak to people at the other end of the table which was a shame. But I'm not willing to drop a star on this as the food was just too good.",

I tried one of the Pizza from the decent selection on offer and i was impressed both with the food and the service. The waiter serving was both very friendly and attentive. There was also a surprisingly good range of beers to choose from. Table service is on offer for both food and drinks which was a nice touch.

It seemed like a family friendly restaurant with a kid's menu that even allowed them to draw their own pizza. However, they didn't provide and crayons or other pens to draw in the kids' menu. What place gives kids a menu that's meant for drawing and then doesn't offer crayons or pens or pencils???Ordered 2 kids meals and 2 burgers for the adults. Our son wanted a slice of tomato with his burger (which didn't come with anything). Waitress: \"I'm sorry that's not possible, the kids meals don't come with any tomatoes / lettuce\". Huge disappointment. They can't spare a slice of tomato??? I went into the kitchen myself where the cook was very happy to give me a slice of tomato.When the food was ready our waitress unfortunately was on a cigarette break. We saw the food on the counter, but decided not to get it ourselves. When she finally arrived (smelling like smoke which irritated the kids), the food was a bit cold.Quality of the burgers: Poor meat quality. lots of bits of gristle, fat, even a piece of bone, they should invest a few p in higher quality ground meat esp. given the price, the bun and dressing was fineValue for money: not great. The burger doesn't come with fries or anything else. I ordered 2 sides which were 6 pounds, so the burger with sides cost 14.50 - which is not great value.Summary, poor service, poor quality of the hamburger meat, nice decor - so 2 stars it is.",

The pizzas were a bit too thin for my liking (tortilla-thin), but some really good flavours. I'll be back v soon to try a burger off the inventive menu, and the other half of the cocktail list",

Myself and the girls went down having been invited for a family and friends day via a friend of Sarah's; Alex.In 1994, Daisy Waugh talks about the Firestation as being in one of the most depressing areas of London. I'm guessing it was much different back then (21years ago?!), as now Waterloo area and the South Bank are lively and busy no matter which time of the year you come. Despite travelling on the sweaty Northern Line tube every day in order to get there for work, I am very much proud and grateful to work in such a fun area. I visited this pub/bar during 2011 whilst working in London the first time around for drinks. There was a noisy atmosphere and I vaguely remember ordering a standard style pub platter with onion rings and the like, with a dipping pot of badly served soured cream. Since my second stint in London from 2013 to date, the Firestation hasn't been on my radar at all; not until Sunday. Since closing at some point in 2014, it's been refurbished and the menu drastically cut down to serve just burgers, pizza, cocktails, ales and ciders. In previous reviews, diners talked about the large airy room, due to it's fire station history causing your words to bounce all around. Waugh talks about no menus on tables, but the food lists only written on blackboards around the room; she actually ordered Mussels back in 1994. 21 years later I chose the Pear Fizz cocktail, which came in a tall glass, a combination of Absolut Pear Vodka, pear pur\u00e9e, lemon juice, sugar syrup and Prosecco - it was delicious. Other treats that arrived at our table were the Blackberry and Cucumber Smash, Blueberry Julep and East 8 Old Up.Next up came the burgers and pizza. Served in a similar style to those in today's popular burger bars; on a metal tray and wrapped in a paper. To be more specific I ordered: Maple Glazed Bacon - 6 oz dry aged beef patty, maple-glazed thick cut bacon, cheese, American mustard mayo, sliced beef tomato, little gem along with a side of mixed fries. LOVE being able to have both fries and the sweet potato ones too! The pizza was thin, with plenty of meaty toppings and a crispy, olive oily crust.I was surprised when looking at the menu that it was just pizza and burgers, however they did both very well. There was a range of table styles and the service was good. A big thanks to Alex to sorted us out there for the afternoon!This is definitely looking to be a place that sounds out for good food and drink, for meeting friends or colleagues with the convenience of the station just next door. A cracking burger, which I would definitely recommend to friends. See the full menu at thefirestationwaterloo.c\u2026",

Minimum decorations inside, I was expecting more Fire Dept memorabilia. My Burger was delicious and drink suburb. The outside is beautiful and next to understand and over ground transportation. Would go again.",
