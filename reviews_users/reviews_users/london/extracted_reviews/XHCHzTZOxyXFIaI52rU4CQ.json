    "text": "Ate here last night and had somewhat mixed views.. The food itself was really good, however the service left a lot to be desired. We were left hanging around whilst being shown to our table as the host stopped to talk to a member of his staff. We then were offered water for the table but was not told that this would be chargeable, our glasses were filled with still water and the bottle taken away, we didn't see the bottle again but we're still charged for the whole bottle. The waitress was very polite but also very distracted and in taking our order we were left worried that she would forget something as she appeared more interested in the other tables than ours. We declined to pay the optional service charge and on leaving were challenged as to why that was. The waitress was again very polite and we discussed our concerns but it was obvious she had been sent by her manager to find out why we did not pay..awkward!!",

    "text": "Jinjuu is a welcome addition to the London dining scene offering casual Korean dining in a fun atmosphere. It's a great place for groups and to celebrate occasions with its sharing concept, fun drinks and weekend dj. I highly recommend the Korean tacos (finally a place in london offers this!) and the Ssam platters. You also can't go wrong with ANY of the starters - I had to order another serving of the bibim salad when I went - and the carnitas fries is a must. The gochu bombs and sae-woo pops are also a nice representation of Korean comfort food. I don't think you can go wrong if you're looking for a fun night out with good food!",

Love the DJ - totally adds good value to the atmosphere. Food - incredible!! Every dish is perfectly seasoned, with some incredible sauces and flavours. Definitely get the pork tacos, the fried chicken and the dumplings.Service - I was very happy when the owner of the restaurant came out after our meal to say hello to her guests. She is a gorgeous, lovely woman who was really kind and flattered to hear our praises.Great spot - I hope it stays exactly the same!Most importantly - the bar is open until about 1:30am and you can order food after midnight - which for London, which is shockingly poor at staying open late for decent cocktails and food - seriously made my night! This place is a goer!C",

    "text": "I enjoyed my time at Jinjuu, couldn't get a reservation in the dining room so sat in the bar area which was nice enough and they give you access to both menus though so no drama. The dining room wasn't full though so don't know why we couldn't get a table...Service was good, door staff and staff in general weren't overly warm, but our waitress was lovely. Kind, patient, informative and had smart waitress sense.Food was good, if not blow your mind amazing. We tried the fried chicken-good flavour, loved the radishes they serve with it, hated both optional sauces though. Dumplings were good, if I was to be super fussy, the pastry was thicker than I'm used to. The sauce they served with it was great, didn't need so much though and why serve dried stringy bits with it? Pointless and weird.Moving on, stuffed jalape\u00f1os were good, great dipping sauce, just super spicy! Que surprise. Bulgogi sliders were excellent, wanted more of those babies! Disco fries were OK, thought they would be better than they were, shame the fries were cheap frozen fries though, they also got very soggy from the juices of the toppings, so perhaps they should be laid out on a larger plate in a thinner layer so they stay crisper?Prawn cake pops were good too. Presentation of the dishes couldn't be faulted, nice sauces and garnishes without over-the-top fussiness and the food came out extraordinarily fast. Portion sizes were about right, value for money for the portion size was not.......I did find it expensive for what was on the plates, but what did I expect for the postcode right? Onto the cocktails, the menu is a Korean-jargon-filled list of foreign ingredients, which sounds fun, but gets tiresome when you actually want to choose a drink. I ended up going for a mango-coconut vodka combination which was nice and had the citrus notes as promised by the menu, but why on Earth would anyone decorate the glass with dessicated coconut? The glass was an old fashioned shallow but wide glass so you have to hold the glass at the stem or use a straw. Plus the coconut gets EVERYWHERE, whether or not you are trying to sip the drink. Good idea in theory but not thought out, the glass got super sticky by the end of the drink and I'm no messy pup.This place has made me more interested in Korean food, I would like to try something more homely in style next time but its certainly a good option for drinks and snacks, just not on a budget.",

    "text": "I didn't have any really great food in London but there were a few worth mentioning. We tried this place Jin Juu owned by Iron Chef UK Judy Joo in Soho. It was pretty busy even after the lunch time. We ordered the Jin chicken to start - Korean fried chicken. It was freshly fried, mixed with the secret soy sauce. The chicken was pretty juicy, not bad. But \u00a38 for 4 pieces of chicken thighs, pricey.Next, we had the Bibimbap with seasoned veggies and fried egg (\u00a38). Taste like any normal Bibimbap, nothing out of the ordinary. Finally, we tried the kalbi beef (\u00a320.5), served with white rice, seasonal leaves, & toasted seaweed. The kalbi wasn't like the ones they usually serve in Korean restaurants - the ones with the bones on it. But the beef was sliced like steak. It was interesting to wrap them in cabbage leaves and rice. The beef wasn't bad, but I think I prefer the beef short ribs with the bones.It wasn't a cheap meal but based on the other restaurants we have tried in London, this is one of the better ones.",

I ordered the Jin Chick and the bulgogi bibimbap. The chicken was perfectly crispy yet tender to eat, with the just-right-pickled moo (white radish) to go with it.The dolsot stone bowl along with all the fresh ingredients perfectly adorning the rice was exactly what I needed to really hit the spot.I'm eyeballing the bo ssam, kalbi and mandoo for my next visit along with that gochugaru brownie!

    "text": "I think 3.5 is more appropriate. \u00a0Overall I really want to like it. \u00a0I think most of the menu is well priced, well presented, and the service I received on both occasions was pretty good. \u00a0The soju even with locational mind I think is at least \u00a33 too expensive for a bottle. I've had the carnitas fries, fried chicken thighs, Bo Ssam, bibimbap with bulgogi, and yook hwae. \u00a0Overall well presented food and I absolutely love the fries, I will keep coming back for those, but my complaint is that everything seems over seasoned. \u00a0I don't like either of the sauces that come with the fried chicken. Ssamjang for me bumps up the seasoning when eaten with unseasoned Korean bbq not with seasoned fried chicken. \u00a0The crisp batter isn't what I think of when I eat fried chicken but I definitely see the tip of her hat to the Brits with the way it's battered. I just wish there was a bit more of a sweet, spicy element rather than so aggressively savoury. Bo Ssam fell flat in so many ways, you need oysters for Bo Ssam even if it's and additional surcharge, ditch the ggim on the salad platter, have your server explain all sauces (and understand their kimchee, the runner had this very wrong), and don't serve it cold! \u00a0Bibimbap was ok but again I think over seasoned. \u00a0Yookhye my gf enjoyed but other than the quality of beef I wasn't excited. \u00a0Observing the wait staff downstairs there is still work to be done as it looks a bit clumsy at times, but our server was pretty good. \u00a0I will go back again and again for the fries and to try new things hopefully my review update will be more delightful.",

    "text": "First of all, I have lived in Korea and am a lover of Korean food. I've been to many/most of the London Korean restaurants and was very excited about trying Jinjuu.I tried to book lunch online through their website (OpenTable) but was unable to so called and left a message. They called me back within 20 minutes and said I could sit at the Bar.The location of the restaurant is good, right behind Regent St./Carnaby St. The decor is excellent - very modern, industrial, with exposed lighting, a lot of steel/rough surfaces. The bathrooms (downstairs) are very cute - with K-Pop posters and old Korean government safety/health posters on the walls.The menu(s) were fairly extensive, but somewhat confusing with a lunch, dinner, anju (side dish) menu as well a separate drinks menu all provided.The dishes were a mix of traditional Korean favourites (e.g. Japchae, Bibibimpap, mandu, kimchee, etc.), as well as some fusion dishes (e.g. Scottish mussels with white wine, dwenjang and bacon!). We ordered Japchae, Korean fried chicken, Bibibimpap, a side dish of kimchee and corn (popcorn) tea.The service was generally good, with the utensils and presentation sophisticated. The quality of the food was mixed though.The Japchae was very salty (we had the vegetarian plate), but still edible. The Bibimbap and Korean fried chicken were both good - particularly the quality of the beef and chicken in both. The kimchee was frozen! After complaining, it was replaced quickly.Overall it was a good meal, reasonably priced. I still think they are having some teething problems. I am keen to try again at night - when I think the style/decor would really shine through.Glad there is a new, sophisticated Korean restaurant in London.",

    "text": "I went to Jinjuu last night with a girlfriend to have a catch up and a nice meal in Central London. It's so difficult finding a restaurant in W1 to eat freshly made food, has an ambience and where you don't feel like you're either sitting on someone's lap or they are earwigging in on your conversation. Jinjuu is my dream come true! Awesome food, gracious service, cool decor and a buzzy but chilled environment downstairs. My friend was running late but it didn't matter to me because I was so comfortable in a nice booth and it gave me time to peruse the menu. I must have studied that menu for over 20 minutes because I couldn't decide what to order because there were too many tempting dishes to choose from! My friend doesn't eat red meat so I didn't get the Korean disco fries because it has pulled pork but I'm definitely getting them next time! \u00a0I did have to order the pork belly tacos with Apple slaw and I ate both of them all by myself! They were absolutely delicious and what I loved most was I was expecting them to be quite sweet but they were the \u00a0perfect blend of moist tender naturally sweet pork, a bit spicy sauce topped with that fresh crisp tangy Apple slaw - absolutely divine! We also had the home made prawn crackers which were absolutely out of this world ! salty, spicy, crunchy, perfect! We also had the Korean fried chicken wings with the two different sauces, again absolutely perfectly fried chicken that didn't taste greasy at all. \u00a0We also had the Korean Caesar salad with grilled prawns which was divine. You could tell that the prawns were fresh and not frozen because they tasted sweet and not rubbery. Oh yes and we also had the tuna tartar with the fried lotus root- \u00a0I think was one of my favourite dishes of the evening! We also had a small bowl of white boiled rice which was cooked to perfection, bit sticky and I had sesame seeds on top as well- \u00a0Yum! Which reminds me the other super highlight was the veggie dumplings. The dipping sauce was freaking delicious and the black and white sesame seeds just made each mouthful a flavourful sensation. You'd think that we had enough with all those small plates but of course we found room for desert. We ordered the Snickers doughnut which had a fancy name but all I remember was that it was a snickers doughnut. When it arrived, it was a deconstructed dish, so there was a small round plain donut, some chocolate ganache, nougat \u00a0ice cream and some sprinkled \u00a0chopped nuts- \u00a0put all together on a spoon, absolutely amazing like a snickers flavoured donut! We actually didn't drink any alcohol that night but I had some delicious mint tea which really really went well with the dinner. I should mention that the presentation of the dishes, the type of teapot my tea came in plus the cups were all very tasteful. Jinjuu is the kind of restaurant that I can go with my husband, go with a group of girlfriends, or bring work colleagues to. I haven't been this excited about a restaurant in a long time. I'm so happy I've found a central London spot!",

    "text": "I was in London for work for 2 weeks. My family came with me for the first week and we were lucky enough to pop in and grab a meal. We were seated upstairs and ordered a bunch of small dishes and then shared a main. (Note that there are 2 pages to the menu! We almost didn't notice it, and that would have been a pity.) Of note are the sae-woo pops (fried prawn balls on sticks) - so delicate and perfectly fried. We also had the bulgolgi sliders, steak tartare, and short rib and kimchi mandoo. My son, who can be hard to please, especially liked the sliders and mandoo. I usually find Korean dumplings to be bland but these were especially flavorful. The slight sweetness of the pears in the beef tartare was a pleasant surprise. My son was stuffed at this point and wanted to save room for dessert, but my husband and I decided to plow ahead and have the bass ssam. Never had a fish ssam before and this was so incredibly good. Light, delicate, perfectly cooked. I wasn't able to sample much of the desserts because of a nut allergy, but my son and husband tried the gochugaru brownie and the chocolate mandarin ice cream. Portions were very generous. I love little details like the crispy chocolate rice that came with both desserts. They were so tasty.When my project was completed, I came back with my team to celebrate. We were seated downstairs which I ended up preferring as it was quieter and we got a view of the open kitchen. Since we were a larger group (and it was on the company), we went all out and ordered a lot more. I feel like we ordered half of the menu. We had the prawn crackers, kong bowl (I want to know what that seasoning is and if it's available for purchase!), carnitas fries, tacos, chicken sliders, fried thighs and wings, steamed mandoo, a salad, noodles, short rib ssam, sirloin ssam and the bass ssam (yes, again, it was that good). There may have been more. I can't believe we finished almost everything and then got a tasting plate of desserts to boot. The chicken was juicy and tender, the short rib and sirloin ssams were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. It was a great meal to end my trip. Oh, and the drinks. I can't believe I forgot to order the Bloody Mary. I did have the bourbon drink and the negroni, both were excellent. Don't forget the bathrooms. Spam doors. Love it.Not sure when I'll be back in London but there are more dishes on the menu I want to try. Like the Bloody Mary and the roasted pork belly bossam.",

The most disappointing part is that I've been sitting here for 40 minutes and haven't a seen any of ordered dishes. And they kept bringing food for my date but not me which is kinda weird and wrong. Nice service okay food ( cause I tried some from my date's plate) but NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN.",

    "text": "I had high expectations going in but was disappointed. I'm rounding up -- I'd give it 2.5 stars. First, I found the menu and the food neither authentically Korean nor creatively fusion. Awkward in-between. Take the bulgogi tacos, for example. As much as the thought could be appreciated, I felt like the heaps of Mexican ingredients overpowered the true star of the dish (bulgogi). Furthermore, I would have expected more creativity from the menu based on all the buzz, but did not see anything that I hadn't seen before. Second, ambience was also so-so for me. I could feel that they were trying too hard to be trendy and fashionable but without achieving neither class nor the cool factor. The rooms generally seemed to follow the \"classy\" code, but the wallpapers in the loo were distasteful and almost trite. Once again, awkward in-between with no sense of true identity. Finally, one thing that was good was the service. Waiters were polite and prompt. I'm so saddened -- I was hoping this would become my new go-to, but it fell far short.",

    "text": "We are traveling from the states and we scoped out places to eat and found Jinjuu prior to arriving in London. I couldn't be more excited to have found a Korean fried chicken place near where we were staying as I am a Korean American. We get to this place, and seeing how packed it was, I had high hopes. That feeling was long gone after we sat. We were stuck with a terrible server who barely acknowledged us and treated us with complete annoyance when we didn't ask for anything other than an extra spoon. There was a big group next to our table, and the way he treated us compared to them was alarming. He was all smiles with the group and while serving them, he didn't check on us once, even to ask if we were doing okay while being inches away. He also stood there while I was trying to pay in cash which made me really uncomfortable. Once I put cash on the table, he immediately took it without saying a word. He didn't even thank us or asked us how the food was which was mediocre to say the least. The chicken was nothing I had hoped for and the raddish had way too much vinegar, taking away the fresh and raw taste it should have had. I usually am not this specific but he was unacceptable. By FAR the worst server I've ever had including the ones I've encountered in the states. The only thing greasier than the food was our servers hair! Watch out for the blonde highlights!",

The japchae was quite good if a little greasy. The fried chicken, on the other hand, was perfect - great crunch, not too greasy, went well with the sauces they gave - would highly recommend thatDessert - Korean mocha - really nice chocolate tart with salted caramel praline - would recommend this dessert for all chocolate lovers Service was great and not too rushed - we had a good time here and I would definitely recommend for friends and come back myself",

    "text": "Delicious food but not authentic - despite what Judy Joo says - and let down by terrible service. The food is great but it is a twist on Korean using elements of Korean flavours to deconstruct dishes and make them into something more trendy and modern. I thought it was delicious but if you want authentic Korean this is not the place. Try one of the small Korean places in and around Holborn or venture out to New Malden for a totally unique Korean home cooking experience. While the food was great, I can't give it more than 3 stars because the service was SO bad. We sat and were immediately asked if we were ready to order - we were only given 2 food menus for 5 people and, despite asking, were never given more. We asked the waiter to come back and it took him ages to do so. We ordered and I had a question about the menu. Instead of answering it the waiter said \"I have other tables waiting for me - hurry up!\" \u00a0I told him I couldn't order if he didn't answer my question and he rolled his eyes. Finally he answered the question about substituting the prawn pops on the tasting menu for something else as I can't east shell fish by saying \"I can't imagine that there is anything we can do for you. Just let someone else eat that one and you can try to swap it with them for something they don't want.\" \u00a0I asked him to check with the chef and after telling me he couldn't imagine the chef would care, he finally asked. Of course, the chef did care and made arancini for me instead, which were very good. During the meal, the waiter kept trying to take our plates away while we were still eating and we had to ask him not to rush us. He seemed to retaliate by then having each new course take 30 minutes to come out. We finally asked the manager, who came to check on us, if he could see where our food was, and even he said that he couldn't imagine what was taking so long. He brought the main courses himself but then it was another 30 minute wait for dessert after those plates were cleared. It was a tasting menu so all the food was ordered at the same time. The manager again had to check on our dessert. Dinner ultimately took 2.5 hours! It also took ages to get our bill as no one ever looked in our direction and people walked past us despite trying to flat them down. The only good service was from the food runners who took time to explain what we were being served and recommend how to mix the many sauces, etc. The food was good but not spectacular (everything was quite salty too) and, with service like that, we won't be back.",

    "text": "A mediocre experience at one of Kingly court's premier Korean establishments. Tatler magazine rated the place as one of the top places to eat in soho, and I'd have to disagree. I think the ambiance was definitely top notch, since we had an open window seat on a warm evening. My friend visiting from abroad enjoyed Soho, and we had a nice dinner. I just think the hype and definitely price didn't live up to its name for me. I'm a big fan of a fair deal, and sadly I feel that JinJuu just didn't deliver top notch food for its pricey menu. The drinks were all right (and strong!) but definitely not worth the price. \u00a311 cocktails is a stretch even in London. We eat a lot of Korean food in Hawaii, but I felt that this joint just didn't live up to my expectations. I think I just wanted a little less glam and a little more Korean oomph and goodness! Definitely a good place for a flashy night with friends though.Edit: the service was amazing though!!! Nice people as always",

    "text": "One of my friends wanted to go there so badly after all the review she had hear so spending some time in London, we book a table for a girls catch up at Jinjuu. First impression when I enter the place: how the waiter can serve you there? There is hardly space between the table. Anyway , we had a small table at the corner so best place if you don't want to be disturb to much with the passage way. We decided to go for starter to share so we had the same woo prawn: excellent, the carnitas fries: really chilli and really good, the small / cute tiny burger: beef and chicken, excellent, chicken wings : the sauce on it was really and vegetable dumpling: so nice. We were 3 and really hungry. It was fine to share starters but the portions of the starter were smalls and the cost was high so not really cool and had to go for more or something else. So if you are really hungry one of 2 starters and then go for a main. As Said, my friend was still hungry so she ordered a bibimbab with beef , I have tried it, it was really good. Finally and that was actually what I should have start with: the cocktails! Lots of choice, original Taste and really well done. Forget about the normal wine and try one the their cocktails you won't be disappointed. So in conclusion it's a nice place, the food \u00a0and drinks are good but the price is way too high for Korean food which is not exceptional! We end up with a bill of \u00a3105 for only 3 people and they even ask for \u00a313 service charge on top, way too much! So nice but too expensive.",

    "text": "Jinjuu is catching a wave right at its crest here in London -- Korean cuisine is on the come-up thanks to accessible menus at places like Bibimbap and Korrito. Both of those places are aiming at an authenticity that Jinjuu isn't interested in: this Korea fused with America and Mexico, and it mostly works. Sorta.Given the month that we waited for a reservation to open up, we expected Jinjuu to be packed and boy it was. The tables are closer together than you expect in London, which I suppose gives Jinjuu an authentic New York or Seoul feel right from the get-go. The music is loud and the lighting is dark -- it doesn't really feel like fine dining and if you find you've got a headache on the day of your Jinjuu reservation, sell your table booking on eBay.The food is nothing less than interesting. We got the Jin Chick signature chicken wings, which were cooked beautifully with nicely crisped skin, but the bold spicing I expected was a timid background flavor instead. Nothing's going to beat Barnyard for the London chicken wings cup anytime soon. The beef bulgogi tacos were a big step up with a surprisingly tasty combination of flavours, but the bibimbap was unexciting and served in an insufficiently hot stone bowl.The weirdest thing on the menu didn't live up to its potential: the carnitas fries are delicious wouldn't be out of place on the menu at Boho Mexica or Wahaca -- you can't taste the kimchi at all.Jinjuu is a perfectly nice place to have dinner, but you'd struggle to identify it as a Korean restaurant if I brought you there blindfolded. Although if they just turn the lighting down one more notch we won't need the blindfold.",

The only thing he said was 'try the tacos' so this was just one of the many dishes my friends and I tried that night. \u00a0 The beef tacos, the carnitas fries and the bibimbap bowls were all delicious and are highly recommended. We also tried to the tempura vegetable plate which was also really good. The tofu was the best I'd ever tasted but the batter was a little heavy for my taste. The only thing we ordered that I wasn't that fond of was the g-something bombs. Essentially, a jalapeno with meat and cheese inside. I didn't find the filling that full or flavorful and again, the batter was a bit heavy for my taste. \u00a0 On the whole we had an excellent time and I'd highly recommend the cocktails too.

And my lovely yelp app gave me the address of this place, which we promptly tried! and we were satisfied with our choice.The menu is ranging over 3-4 pages of soju-based drinks (for anybody wondering, soju is a classical korean alcoholic, comparable to a \"rice vodka\"), some wines (short selection actually I was expecting a bit more!) and few classical cocktails. But my suggestion is definitely to go for a soju cocktail, this is one of the few places in London serving them and you want to check them out! When we ordered our drinks, the waitress nicely suggested us a different cocktail for a \"first-timer soju\" and we followed her suggestion, I love whenever a waiter is doing that \"extra-mile\" for suggesting something more tailored on yourself!The cocktail we ordered, K-POP pornstar (yep, their range of names is pretty awesome!), was a wonderful combination of sweetness from the passion fruit and the bitterness of sparkling soju, something I loved!We will surely get back here for dinner, if they care about food as much as they do care about drinks we are in presence of something wonderful!",

However something seem to have improved however I am still not a big fan of the beef Bimbimbap.. The marinade just don't do it for me. However we tried the pork and the prawns today and the pork had a lot more flavours going for it.. We also ordered some starters to share, \u00a0the prawns style cake pops, \u00a0those were yummy the chilli mayo was good but I would prefer the hot sauce that came with the fried chicken. Which was also yummy.. Finger licking good.. They had a whole fried chicken which served 3-4 but we weren't there just for the fried chicken so we only went for the thighs and wings mix. The mocktails are also delicious... I got the jinjuulicious and I really like the combo they had.. With a cough clearing I thought something with some friendly bacteria yakult will definitely help! We also ordered the kimchi plate.. Boy I could do with a bigger portions.. Cause the size of the serving is a little on the small side. I would definitely go back for some more of the starters for sure!",

We splurged on the 7-course signature menu - though that's really not as extravagant as it sounds as it should really be called the 7-dish dinner! I love trying new things, especially of the foodie variety, so I loved that it taught me what things like kimbop were (the Korean answer to sushi don'tcha know ;) as well as mandoo and sae-woo pops. The 'main' dishes were tricky but fun to eat, needing to be assembled and wrapped up in lettuce leaves so a very hands-on job!Our server was so polite and chatty, and would always engage with us with a little comment or anecdote between every course. It was just a shame it was tricky to get his attention. The drinks were also very slow to appear as I think they come from the bar upstairs. I thought overall it was pricey for what it was, but I did like the surroundings a lot and it was certainly humming nicely on a Saturday night. Don't miss the loos if you visit either - Asian boyband posters aplenty in the ladies (and I was told something a little naughtier in the men's!).",

I had tried to book a table for 2 online but they said they were fully booked, I thought sod it, I'm going anyway - I will get a table. My friend and I arrived around 7 o'clock and we were seated straight away (mini fist pump) and right by the open window - it was a lovely evening. We were very happy.The waiter greeted us immediately with a welcoming smile and some fresh water. As my friend and I hadn't seen each other for a while we were mattering away for a while - the waiter came over a couple of times to ask for our order which wasn't a problem and we eventually made a decision and ordered. I have to say that throughout the evening the waiting staff were very friendly and attentive and it was an overall lovely experience - even when it was becoming a little cold, they quickly whacked on the heaters and made sure we were comfortable! Now to the food, it's advertised as Korean street food - if they are selling this on the streets inoh the food. For starters we ordered the mandoo dumplings (beef and pork) and the Kimchi Arancini - the food came at a good speed and was presented beautifully. The dumplings were mouth-wateringly wonderful - truly meaty in the centre and wrapped in a tasty and slippery casing. Quite difficult to eat with the mental chop sticks but I got there. Scrumptious. The kimchi balls too were amazing. A soft rice and cheesy centre and coated in bread crumbs - just delicious bites of goodness. \u00a0Next, the mains. We both opted for the Jap Chae (sweet potatoe noodles) - I had prawns and my friend had the beef. The food once again was presented beautifully and served with fresh veg. The prawns were cooked beautifully and there were LOTS of them. I also tried the beef and it was tender and very flavoursome. The noodles too were delicious and you tasted the freshness in every mouthful!!What a meal and what an experience! Truly fantastic and I will be back to try more of their delicious menu!!",

The waiters were very friendly and the service was very good. There is such a wide choice of delicious things to have but we decided on in a lightish lunch . We started with really tasty Pork Belly Tacos then some Carnitas Fries followed by Korean Fried Chicken which is amazing to finish we had a delightful Korean salad with Prawns and Asian Slaw . I would highly recommend a visit to ether Jinjuu for fantastic Korean cuisine #food #restaurant #korean",

    "text": "Finally ventured into this delectable place for my birthday lunch two weeks ago. My google maps took me the long way round, but it's just off regents street If you're not too sure. Lucky I booked a table, as it was relatively packed for a Sunday! Sat downstairs in the main dining area, facing the kitchen, and on top of the hooded fan, they have a lovely quote board. The walls are all designed to fit the Korean theme and jinjuu itself which means \"Pearl\" it has a clean, modern layout, with table booths and normal comfy seating. Been following on instagram for a while now, and the food looks tantalising. I ordered the kong bowl - so morish, yummy, and not too spicy, just the right amount. Very generous with the portion too. I loved the Sae-who pops, they reminded me of my cake pops. They were so good, my favourite. Of course when you're at jinjuu you have to order the kfc - Korean fried chicken, I went for the thighs and they were served with two cute little sauce bottles, dark soya and gochujang red chilli. OMG seriously!!!!! The best fried chicken I've ever had, undoubtedly the bestest!! I'd go back just for that. Also ordered the ya-chae mandoo - vegetable dumplings and wow, such cute presentation! Served in its own canape spoon with the sauce and all you do it dip the spoon into the sauce and eat it in one bite! The best Korean food in London by far!!!!! Judy Joo I love you!!!! I wanted to stay for mains but my tummy was at the brink!! Service was exceptional, everything was explained and also what drinks to match the dish too. Cutlery on the table was so neat, the gold chopsticks and soup spoon, attention to detail! The bar staff themselves are very polite! I am returning very soon and looking forward to checking out the HK branch too I'd highly recommend this as one of my top 5 spots in London!!!!! Also the cocktails are exceptionally yummy! :)",

A friend and I popped in on a busy Friday night just before 8 and were lucky enough to get a seat inside (there were a few damp cold tables outside).We just wanted a quick bite so went for 3 sharing dishes and a glass of wine each. The food is served as it is ready so first up were the chicken sliders. They are amaaaazing! A must try. Next were the carnitas fries that I had raved about from my last visit. They were good but definitely not as good as last time - less toppings and not piping hot. Our third dish was beef dumplings - unfortunately these took nearly 30 mins to come following the rest of the food. After all that I didn't think they were anything special but my friend thought it was worth the wait - a complimentary glass of wine each and a sincere apology made up for it :) The food and waiting staff always impress me and they were so busy I can see how slip ups happen in the kitchen. I'll be back!",

Their dumplings lacked flavour and Soju was just mediocre. Which is unfortunate because the place does have a nice snappy ambiance. I wouldn't come back here, for those of you looking for korean food take a few extra steps towards chinatown (e.g. Little Seoul) if you fancy having a proper korean meal. Besides the food not being great the service was also unfortunate, they seemed to be all over the place and rude when I mentioned my chicken was not ok. It was just an observation, nothing for the hand-tattooed waiter to get upset about.. Maybe some time in HK but never again in London!",

I'm not trying to come across pretentious either. Just I like what I like and I dismiss the things that I don't. What I do recommend is the bibimbop, tuna taco & cod saam.

    "text": "Amazing asian fusion restaraunt!I came here with my dad for dinner not expecting the food to be out of this world, only because I am korean and my mom cooks authentic (secret recipee type) food at home all the time. We tend to always compare other korean/asian food to hers, because her food that she makes is in fact out of this world. Here at jin juu we had a great experience. I love there tacos. They are absolutely amazing. My favorite taco is the tuna (raw tuna) taco. The tuna is so tender and soft and it melts in your mouth. The mini sliders are also a favorite of mine. The beef and chicken sliders were absolutely delicious. The spices and sauce they use to flavor the sliders are awesome too. That is what makes the slider so amazing. Their kimchi fried rice is pretty good too. It comes with an egg on top. The only thing i didnt like about the kimchi fried rice was that there were small pieces of sausage in it. I wasnt a fan of that. Lastly, the jap chae wasnt very good. It was way too salty and was flavoured with way too much soy sauce. I could not take another bite. However, my overall experience here was perfect. Great staff, great ambiance, great music/vibe and great food! This place is a must try for anyone with a hankering for some asian food.",

    "text": "Could Korean food be the next hot food trend in London? Although there are already well established hot spots like New Malden, chains like Kimchee and OntheBap are bringing fast Korean food to the massesI had seen Jinjuu chef Judy Joo on the Food Network and decided to give them a try as I'm a big fan of fried chicken and am still looking for someone in London to match Bonchon in San FranciscoJinjuu had a very trendy, hip vibe despite me visiting at lunchtime and service was efficient throughout. I was seated downstairs and able to watch the chefs at workI spied an interesting \u00a345 tasting menu but that had to wait for another day as I wasn't in a mood to splurge that day. However, I did pick 2 dishes off that menu - sae-woo pops and Korean fried chicken thighsThe sae-woo pops were 5 deep fried prawn cakes, which arrived on sticks, served with a side of creamy gochujang mayo for dipping. For those unfamiliar with Korean food, gochujang is Korean hot sauce and a staple of Korean food and cooking. Nice and crispy but the mayo reflected one weakness of Korean food for me - their hot food tends to be hot without much other flavouring to round it out, so you just get heatA bonus mark for using thighs in the fried chicken. So much more juicy. The chicken was crispy and served with pickled white radish on the side to give some contrastAn enjoyable meal and that tasting menu is interesting enough for a return visit but my top fried chicken is still at the Lockhart in Marble Arch",

The menu has loads of great things to try and I wouldn't sway you away from anything, but I do have some favourites. There are quite a few, so go with friends, share and enjoy!The Sae-Woo Pops-GREATThe Carnitas Fries-AMAZING-imagine amazing nachos, but instead of crisps it's chips-Perfect!Tacos-GREATBulgogi Burgers-AMAZING-Some of the best sliders I have had anywhereKorean Fried Chicken-GREAT-Their speciality, but not my favourite dishAdd in another portion of tacos and Sliders and the above would feed 2 easily, I always go for some Prawn Crackers as well!Drinks wise, they have a great cocktail menu...the K-Pop Pornstar is my favourite.Top 3 tips for this place-1.Book if your going in the evening-it gets busy2.Orders lots of the smaller plates and try as much as you can3.Give their cocktails a try, they are well worth it",

I had the k-pop pornstar & Lychee lover. The food is presented very well. My favorites are the carnitas fries, sae-woo pops and bibimbap bowl. The Carnitas fries are very spicy. The bibimbap bowl has a lot going on and is filling if you are hungry.The only real negative is that I found it very noisy, so was hard for me to concentrate on listening to my friends conversations.",

We split a soju as it can be strong, but later we switched to me having the top shelf shots and my wife had lychee infused soju. \u00a0So good!We booked on OpenTable and we're seated immediately.What really stands out is the diversity of cross-cuisine food combinations such as Korean Tacos. \u00a0We would definitely come here again.",

I vote no.I thought that this was a Korean restaurant. Vegetable crisps with guacamole?Corn salsa?Cheesy chips?I do not compute this fusion.Had to skip the sweet potato noodle as I have never had a plate filled with so many items taste completely of nothing.Amazed the reviews are so full of praise. I must stress that the highlights was certainly Antonio the waiter. The amount of food you get for the set menu price is great, and perhaps it was a rare glitch on the day we eat where all the seasoning went missing.",

Mind that the service is very slow but staff is very nice not that it makes up for the slowness. The food was well seasoned and presented. I adored the beef tartare with Asian pear.The japchae was good but not enough noodle for the price.My friend had the bibimbap and thought it was too much rice versus meat and veggies. I didnt taste it.The desserts were hit and miss too.I had the makgeolli and white chocolate panacotta \u00a0with mango compote, passion fruit and yuja jelly and lychee sorbet. it was an absolute delight, a must order.My friend had the Korean Mocha.This was too heavy in chocolate and the texture of the dessert was too dense, I would not recommend it. Finally the drinksThe cocktails are really good and unusual.I would recommend the bird is the word as a pre-dinner drink and the white rice negroni as a post-dinner drink.Overall, I would comeback but mostlikely for drinks and sharing some anju dishes",

Jinjuu is one of those fusion style restaurants opened by a celebrity chef, and I really enjoyed my experience there!We ordered the Pork Belly Tacos, Pork Mandoo, Bulgolgi Sliders, and the fried chicken thighs to split between two people. My personal favorites were the Pork Belly Tacos, they were fantastic! The Bulgolgi Sliders were delicious as well. The fried chicken was actually my least favorite dish (I found it to be a bit too salty in taste, which is strange because it is supposed to be their signature item).For drinks, I had the Spiced Kimchi Mary, and I could definitely taste the kimchi. It was a unique twist on the typical Bloody Mary, and I quite liked it.Atmosphere inside Jinjuu was pretty trendy, with plenty of young 20s/30s people out for food and drinks on a weekend evening. Service was attentive, and the server did a good job providing recommendations on what to order.Will definitely return to Jinjuu in the future for a night out for drinks with the girlfriend and/or friends!",

So, I've had their Jap Chei and Bibimbap. When my husband and I came we tried a few dishes and they were not only delicious, but uniquely different, beautiful and holy crap so yummy. Kimbap- basically warm sushi and delicious, fresh, and lightYa-Chae Mandoo- vegetable dumplings- the dumplings themselves were silky and delicious, but the sauce that went with it wacked the dish up to a flavoursome mouthful of happyKong Bowl- yummy edamame Jap Chei- absolutely phenomenal! The noodles were warm and slippery- it doesn't sound so appetising but the flavour is so wonderful and at the same tim t's all so light! AH! I seriously love the textures and the flavours. The atmosphere and service is also very nice as well. We will be back.",
