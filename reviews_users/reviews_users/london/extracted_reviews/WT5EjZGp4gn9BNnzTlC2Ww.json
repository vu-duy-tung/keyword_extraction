    "text": "It is so tempting !!!All the cakes and pastries and scones and croissaunts heaped on the left near the entrance, so that every passer by can look and stop and look again and lick their lips and then be forced to come in.And they all look so good ... the meringues, or the cheesecakes or the tarts ... its a delight to just think of what to order.I went to Ottolenghi today, as it was the first recommendation in the french toast thread i had started ... and it had some really good french toasts. Not too heavy, but very filling ... cinnamon flavoured, with berries and syrup. My friends ordered breads and pastries, and loved the nutella and the butter and the different jams on the table. I saw some people ordering the scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, which i will have next time. Looked very appealing.It was crowded for sunday brunch, and so you might have to wait a while to be seated. But after that the service is quick and prompt. A very nice breakfast place indeed.",

Seriously, the chocolate ganache cake is unreal. I've paid anywhere from 12 to 20 pounds for a meal with a protein, a salad or two, and dessert. It's definitely not cheap, but for the quality it's understandable.I still haven't had an actual sit-down meal here though. Ah well, it's probably best for me to leave before I can go back for seconds (and thirds and fourths) on the chocolate chip pecan cookies. And maybe just a bit more of that roasted root vegetable salad.",

I was fortunate that the legendary line did not form until I was seated. There are only about 50 seats and most are at a communal long table. This is a plus as I got to compare raves with locals, and folks from Korea and the US (like me). The lunch menu allows you to choose from three or four salads (9 available) with the main course (6 available. The price was \u00a313.70 or \u00a316.20 really fair for such complex well made dishes. The wine list is excellent too with about 20 offerings by the glass and an additional 15 by the bottle- for lunch! The entree and salads are served on a single plate. Service is good and there is no pressure to turn your seat over to those waiting in line. No one appeared to wait more than fifteen minutes except a couple who wanter their own table and waited 20 minutes for it.The desserts were great and there were many flour-free offerings (which I'm sure had no calories so have two).Read \"Plenty\" and then go an experience it there.

As expected the place was busy and we had to wait for 30min, but thought it'd be worth it (esp. after looking at the menu and the display of salads and mains). Indeed, food was really good, lots of vegetarian options, fresh and tasty but bit expensive and portions rather on the small side. Staff was nice and didn't rush us out, even if there were lots of people waiting for a table. Overall a lovely place to have brunch, won't be coming here if I'm startving, but will keep it on my \"treats' list",

Which isn't great considering the astronomical cost of the place (we paid \u00a355 per head for mains, dessert and prosecco). We were there on a weekday evening, and the staff were very nice, the food is in the main delicious (although less vegetarian options than you would expect given that most of their publicity is in the vegetarian domain). Overall, I would come here occasionally but I'd definitely try to aim for a quiet period. And I really think they would do well to let people have a bit more personal space. The woman sitting next to me was on her own and clearly didn't appreciate my arrival, likewise I didn't enjoy the people on the other side of us listening in to every single word of our conversation.",

I called today (Sunday) to ask about a reservation. They said no reservations, and they close at 7. They were anxious to get off the phone, and made very little effort to help me understand whether 7 means doors close at 7, seating stops at 7, the kitchen closes at 7, etc. Fair enough, it could be a busy night. So we showed up, waited to be seated. It wasn't terribly busy, but the man serving just couldn't be bothered to answer our questions (whether there was a separate dinner menu from the food on display).They just didn't seem to care that we wanted to dine there, so we found another place to eat. I'm sure the food would have been great, and I'm sure there are terrific waiters. We just had two bad service experiences in a row.",

    "text": "Hmmm. After hearing such lovely things about Ottolenghi, I really wanted to try it out. After booking a month or so in advance, we finally secured a Saturday night seating for three. As most people probably know by now, they do a bunch of sharing plates (with a suggestion of 2-3 per person). I love to share, so that's okay. However, they also do a sharing table. As in if you book for any more than two people, you've got to sit at a communal table in the center of the room. Well, I was okay, because I was on the end, however, the other half had a really obnoxious neighbor who was sitting way too close to him, and they kept bumping elbows. The dude also kept staring ridiculously whenever anything happened. It's just an awkward situation all around. Given the size of the venue, i can see why they do it, because they can fit way more people inside, but it can just lead to awkward dining situations all around.The other half and I split a bottle of wine while Nava got a glass of white. The white was really boring. Nava described it as \"If someone mixed honey and water\". The red was better, but the other half wasn't that impressed. The dessert wine was alright, but not amazing. So the wine list really could use a bit of improvement.The food is actually quite tasty. Of the bread they start with, just skip everything and get lots of corn bread. That was fantastic. The rest of the bread was okay, with the focaccia bread being a bit burnt and unpleasant. We ended up with four cold dishes and four hot dishes. I thought the yellowtail was the best, followed by the beets. The eggplant was kind of boring for me, and the grilled peaches were nice, but the endive was a bit harsh for me. In the hot dishes, all four were tasty, and the truffle honey was nice on the fried zucchini blossoms, but I've had better zucchini blossoms in London. Of course we had dessert, and they were all really nice. The carrot cake was okay, I was glad it wasn't the one I ordered, as I've had much better. My berry financier was amazing though, and Nava's flourless orange and chocolate cake was fantastic. We also were lured in by the peanut butter 'Smores, but they didn't really work for me. I like peanut butter and 'Smores, but unfortunately these weren't 'Smores. So while the food is quite good, I really don't understand why the bookings fill up so quickly, because the food isn't good enough for that. (And FYI, I checked this morning and I couldn't book a 3 person table for a reasonable time on the weekend through September.) Also the communal dining really annoyed the other half due to an obnoxious neighbor. So, I'll probably not be back. However, I will probably pick up a cookbook or two. Making the recipes at home will be much easier than trying to book, and you don't have to worry about dining with people that may ruin your evening.",

Attentive service and water frequently topped up without asking. Mocha (I never drink straight coffee) is so-so.This is also one of those places that has a super simple menu that makes you think \u00a0you're going to get a super tiny portion of something due to the lack of descriptive words. E.g. the welsh rarebit description is only around 8 words but translates into 2 giant pieces of bread with plenty of salad and cheese. The same with the french toast and a bean stew I had. Really big portions, excellent taste and quality and a lot less pretentious a establishment than I had envisaged.Next, I must try lunch here! Also the bread board. Wow.",

Of course you can sit down but may involve a wait or a reservation.For dinner: You will need to reserve, unless you walk in around 10pm as we did the other day and manage to snag a space. All small dishes but I like the way they just refer to them as starter size and you get to sample more of the items on the menu. Just choose a range of cold and hot dishes and share. It would be hard to only order one thing here since I usually want everything on the menu. You can't go wrong with your choice anyway.Always exciting and inventive with many combinations of ingredients and contrasting bright flavours. Late in the evening after many diners, service was great and just the right level of attention and chatty exchange.Even the bill was very moderate for the quality of food we enjoyed so this goes straight into the 5 star territory for me.Yes, I have all the cookbooks too.",

    "text": "My cafe-owning husband had been raving about the Ottolenghi recipe book for ages now, this was the first time we'd been able to sample the food directly. As I understand it, Ottolenghi own several food shops around London; the Islington shop is their first sit-down restaurant.We got there on a Friday at 12:00 noon, and within 30 minutes the place was packed. You can walk in, order a sandwich and take-away salads, and be on your merry way.If you have the time (and the opportunity) to sit down, you go to the back of the premises where a long communal table and a few satellite 2-seaters await.The decor is very decidedly 70's retro; white-plastic everything with lime-green cushions, chrome standing lamps, the odd bit of fuchsia here and there. However they managed to put on the brakes before going too far, and the effect is entertaining without being eye-rolling.It's a *very* small space, and they cleverly went for the maximum daylight with as much glass in the walls and roof as they could.The overall effect is bright and airy with enough design employed to make lunch here feel like an event.Ottolenghi is all about the best and freshest ingredients, imaginatively used and presented to the customer in the most fantastic way. When you walk into the place, both sides of the front-of-house are stacked with the most jaw-dropping, eye-popping displays of salads and desserts you have ever seen. It's such a small premises, and yet how they use their food as display is simply brilliant. You want everything.The food has a very definite Lebanese / Mediterranean slant, and the menu is just chock-full of tasty salads, main courses... it just goes on and on. The menu cannot but satisfy picky vegetarians and carnivores with voracious appetites in one sitting. Quite, quite superb.Whilst I love my desserts, I've never been a huge fan of cheesecake. No longer, because the apricot cheesecake at Ottolenghi is quite simply the best dessert I've ever tasted. I'm going to say it again - the best dessert I have ever tasted; and if you ever saw my waist-line you'd know I've had a few desserts in my time.Friendly staff? Though the place was crowded, our waitress still found the time to answer our questions, discuss the food (she knew what she was talking about) and tell us a little about herself, not to mention getting us permission from the manager to take a few photos of the heavenly food displays at the front.From now on, every time I'm in London, I'll be dropping in to Ottolenghi without fail. Five star.",

    "text": "I thought I died and went to culinary heaven! Ottolenghi uses the finest selection of fresh organic ingredients in a unique combination to create amazing mouth watering gastronomic delights! The recipes consist of a diverse fusion of Mediterranean, Asian, Moroccan and Indian ingredients to create one of a kind dishes served in sharing portions similar to Spanish raciones. \u00a0Excellent wine menu and attentive service. We sampled the yellowfin tuna plate, sushi grade tuna sliced thin with a light crust garnished with a wasabi cream sauce. YUM! The Aubergine salad consisted of fresh baby greens tossed in a savory vinaigrette and complimented the tuna. The grilled sea bass with raisin salsa had a Moroccan twist and a spicy potato dish was fantastic. We regret that we did not have any room left to sample the baked and sweets menu but they looked almost too good to eat! It's a high end establishment with commensurate prices but definitely worth it as the food is of excellent quality and the menu is unique and creative. I am amused by the reviews from the locals because they are so accustomed to having so many wonderful dining options that they tend to be a tad jaded. They are so fortunate to be able to live in London and have all these wonderful establishments on their doorstep.It's easy to take these things for granted until you move to an area where you don't have these dining options. I can appreciate the uniqueness of Ottolenghi as there is nothing like it in Tampa Florida. Yotam Ottolenghi, the chef and founder of this chain of highly successful and unique chain of combination gourmet food shop/restaurant spends much of his time creating and testing recipes for these shops and his column in the Guardian in addition to TV appearances.",

Ottolenghi is a pearl amongst the dross, and at the risk of hyperbole, just about dished up the most delicious meal I've had in the capital. I snuck a seat on the communal table where I met a lovely brace of Kiwis and North Americanos. \u00a0I selected lamb which is served with an aubergine puree thing and some kind of chervil (maybe) - Yikes, who can remember all those Ottenghengish ingredients? I also had a wicked salad with spicy macadamias, gorgonzola, quince, and leaves. Just divinely subtle and interesting mix of flavours and textures. Sounds like slim pickings, but the salad was a reasonable serving. I followed it up with a vanilla and apple cake which is served with a gorgeous thick and cool custard. Eating alone, I had a chance to really savour the flavours. Two dishes, glass of wine and massive aforesaid cake came to \u00a332 - incredible value for the quality on offer. Miam miam.",

We finally booked a table for a Friday night (two months in advance - Fridays are popular!) and had such an incredible meal. I can't wait to go back. We had a mix of things from the kitchen and from the counter and all were truly magnificent. When I heard that Ottolenghi's next cookbook is going to be all about sauces, I was pleased and not the least bit surprised. Every single dish served with an accompanying sauce was different and interesting. The sauces didn't taste too heavy, but the flavors were complex and fresh and just all-around brilliant. The unpretentious dining room, kind staff, and clean, relaxed atmosphere made this such an enjoyable experience. I've recommended it to many people as it was one of the best meals I've ever had. I keep telling myself I'm going to stop in and pick up some things from the counter to takeaway, but the queue is always out the door so I haven't braved that just yet. But I will. Oh, I will.",

Shortly after we were seated and placed our orders, the queue started forming and went out the door! This place is very popular - and rightly so.I ordered the bean chili dish and the only other order I remember is the North African dish that came in a skillet. You could tell in that there was thought and care given to the presentation of the food, it looked fresh and tasty when presented... and it was.The bean chili was great. There was bean & sausage chili served with a slice of blood sausage on top of fresh bread. This was paired with a fried egg and salad greens. The ingredients were fresh and paired well. Even the blood sausage tasted great, and I'm not usually a big fan. Overall great place to dine, especially when you don't have to queue. To be fair, the line did seem to move relative quickly, so don't be too disheartened if the queue stretches out the door.",

    "text": "Within 15 minutes of booking our flight to London we had reservations for Ottolenghi secured, that's how high eating here was on our list of priorities. My vegetarian girlfriend is kind of obsessed with the Plenty cookbook and so I was expecting a fully vegetarian menu. I was pleasantly surprised to find some meat dishes, and the tea smoked lamb cutlets were actually the highlight for me, although everything we had was fantastic. Lots of simple, bold flavors with an emphasis on quality ingredients. I loved the ambiance, just the right mix of romantic and laid back, with enough seating variety to work for large groups with the communal tables and small tables for two tucked away. The service was attentive and helpful, not nearly as pretentious as the price and quality would justify.And then there are the desserts. It's like they took a world class restaurant, and then added a world class confectionery to the front of the restaurant. It's almost too much. When we went in the front door our eyes enlarged like a cartoon character as we took in all of the sweets, and spent the time waiting for our table scheming about which desserts we'd get. By the time we had finished with our meal, we sheepishly admitted we'd have to get a dessert to go because we just weren't able to fit one more bite of food inside of us. This worked out great though and let us extend our Ottolenghi experience out to the next day.Reservations here are highly recommended, as a number of people tried to walk in while we were there and turned away.",

    "text": "As you enter there is the counter area, full of cold savoury dishes as well as cakes and desserts with the dining room situated at the back of the space. We were sat at the end of the long, central communal table which is dim and candle lit in the evenings (there are smaller, separate tables for couples). We ordered a round of Kia Royales while we looked over the menu. Our waitress came over and explained that everything was starter sized, so we'd probably need 2-3 dishes per person. This was a bit scary, as the dinner menu averaged out to about \u00a310 a dish and aside from the cost, I wasn't sure if it was possible to split a starter portion between 6?!The menu was split in to two sections, counter and kitchen with seven or eight dishes on each. The counter dishes being those that are on display at the front of the restaurant and the kitchen dishes being cooked fresh and served hot from the very capable kitchen team. As well as several bottles of wine we ordered pretty much everything on the menu.The Islington restaurant has daily changing breakfast, lunch and dinner menus but you can expect things like Glazed pig cheeks with apple stuffed tail and celeriac and barberry salad, Roasted aubergine with Iranian lime yoghurt, pomegranate seeds, spicy nuts and mixed herbs and Five spice crispy tofu with tomato and cardamom passata, braised aubergine and pickled lotus root, which I'm sure you'll agree all sound mouth-watering!Every dish was fantastic, beautifully flavoured and perfectly cooked but they really do mean starter size, the portions were an issue as we could only have a mouthful of each dish and not even that in some cases, there were only 4 scallops between 6. By the end of it we still had plenty of space for dessert. A few of us got up and wandered through the restaurant to scout the dessert counter and reported back. Again, these were delicious.",

Not too many choices actually, I went there around 3pm, peas salad, pumpkin salad, cauliflower , broccoli, mixed cabbages ,potatoes salad and aubergine dish. I asked for small takeaway box, filled with broccoli salad, cauliflower salad and mixed cabbage, \u00a0the potion was really nice, with reasonable price. Broccoli was chunky and tasty, well cooked, spicy and full of garlic flavour, just like chinese stem fried garlic broccoli. \u00a0Cauliflower somehow more greasy than the broccoli dish, however well cooked, tender and juicy. They used lots of nuts, pistachio and almond, in their dishes. Not bad, more fun. \u00a0Mixed cabbage, very fruity, really funny, enjoyable.Dessert. \u00a0 Mountains of cakes and tarts there. I bought pistachio lemon cake, blueberry cupcake and carrot cake. Carrot cake, good texture! Lots of nuts and dried fruit dices, light topping, feel the energy and feel healthy . \u00a0Pistachio one was so cute. Pitch of pistachio on the top of icing sugar, looks like elderflowers blossom on the snow mountain. The cake base was quite wet, unexpected. But still taste good. The blueberry cupcake, better go with coffee or tea, topping was really rich. Overall, a creative restaurant, good for family and group. Great for afternoon tea , light meal before dinner , pre-theatre dining. \u00a0Ps I won't say the salads there are healthy... =_=",

At 17 quid, all I have to say is..meh! Though delightful to look at, the various salads simply were not the attack on my tastebuds I was hoping for. \u00a0I cannot pinpoint one dish of the various mixes as standing out or being particularly bad, but I ultimately didn't finish the plate as after finishing about half I simply was no longer in the mood to eat it.  I recently wrote a review of Pita Gourmet in Fitzrovia and they two simply don't compare in terms of taste and value. \u00a0That being said, I'm aware of all the rave on Ottolenghi for dinner and look forward to coming back again for a seated reservation and separate review.",

So it was a dream come true, wasn't it? Afraid to say it wasn't. The online booking times speak for themselves, you can choose the requested time by the quarter of the hour, which sums up the atmosphere quite well. It was all about making the most (of turnover) out of the least (available space). We were directed in a hurry to our opposite seats with two larger parties right and left of us, which made it difficult to have any sort of conversation. And then we were left with the menue. No recommendations, no questions about likes or dislikes, forget about any sommelier advice regarding the wines. The food was fine, the wine too warm, the service minimalistic and the guests the kind of neo-folk-we-feel-the-place-and-wear-vintage-sari-blouses-and-Persian-jewellery-because-we-can-afford-it.Love the cookbooks more!",

The salads can be superb and the meringues are second-to-none, but the overall experience is a bit chaotic for an establishment charging so much for the privilege of eating there. I've often had to stand in a disorganised queue for what feels like a very long time when about to hand over a hefty sum for salad. If you're lucky you can grab one of the pavement tables on a warm day and watch the world go by as you eat your very nicely-prepared food. But I'm not so keen on the canteen-style seating and the so-trendy-it-hurts chairs. Your best bet if you've not got in early enough to nab a good spot is having Ottolenghi as a take-away treat option.",

But the food is good. \u00a34.50 for half a sandwich is taking the Michael, but the cakes we tried were as tasty as they were pretty. My chocolate and hazelnut ricotta thing was too heavy and I didn't eat it all, but everything looked amazing and I'd try it all again. I just honestly don't want to come back at the weekends.

    "text": "Ottolenghi's is my most favourite place for brunch, lunch and and everything else in between. I can't resist the cakes here, also they have the nicest tarts, cupcakes and meringues. The apple cake is especially delicious; moist, flavoursome, with creamy buttercream filling. The slices are huge and every time I get one I swear I can't eat it all, but inevitably of course I do, because it's too damn delicious to leave! Since as I am a complete cake geek, I can be critical at times, but I really have no complaints about Ottolenghi's, not one single grumble. As they don't have a menu with them on, once you are shown to your seat, it's best to get up and go to the entrance (where they're all displayed) see what you want and memorize the name to later tell your waiter.The savory food is a Mediterranean affair and you can mix and match from things like 'Couscous and mograbiah with oven-dried tomatoes', 'Saut\u00e9 of chickpea, butternut squash and chard, served with mint yoghurt' and 'Roast chicken with chilli and basil'. Everything is super fresh and you can really taste the quality of the ingredients in these mouthwatering creations. I think I'm in love! They also have a cookbook (anybody fancy buying me this for Christmas?!) and cookery classes every month where you can learn to create an Ottolenghi experience in your own home, although these don't come cheap at around \u00a3125 per class. The only slight problem I have is the table layout of a huge bench running down the middle, which often means you're sat closer to your neighbour rather than the person you came with who is opposite. This also means that when it's busy you can hear more of what the person next to you is saying rather than the one infront! BUT if you're lucky enough to bagsy one of the side tables for two then it's a fantastic experience eating here.",

    "text": "It's embarrassing that I live 5 minutes from this place and didn't discover it until I read about it on yelp.Islington, and in particular Upper St, is chain central. \u00a0Technically you'd have to classify Ottolenghi as a chain as well, as there are four of them, but it doesn't feel chainy. \u00a0The decor is predictable: \u00a0that modern, spartan look that is so beloved of fusion restaurants everywhere. \u00a0I like the communal tables, especially when one gets placed next to four attractive young ladies. \u00a0The place was packed when I went there so the ambience is fantastic.Apparently the menu changes every day, and there is a selection of hot and cold dishes to choose from. \u00a0The servings are entree sized so you need to get 2 or 3 each, and given they range in price from \u00a38-\u00a311 this can add up. \u00a0For the most part, the dishes all had sharply defined flavors, and the ingredients were of a high quality. \u00a0I thought a few of the flavor combinations were a bit weak but there wasn't anything really disappointing. \u00a0Be prepared for the dishes to come out willy nilly (with cold dishes coming out first).Despite what everyone else has said, I was not impressed with dessert. \u00a0Yes, it does look cool having them all stacked up at the entrance, but in the end they are just cake and pastries. \u00a0I expected a bit more imagination.Another thing I didn't like was that we booked in advance for 7:30, but when we got to the restaurant we were told we only had the table until 9:30. \u00a0If you are serving two sittings, then you should tell me this when I call up, not when I get there. \u00a0They eventually came over and told us we could have it as long as we'd like, but it almost sounded like we should be grateful for their benevolent munificence.I have it on good authority that the waiters here are \"hot\", and this was certainly borne out by the fact that the four females sitting next to me would start giggling like school girls everytime their Israeli waiter came by. \u00a0I personally found the service irritating; this is one of those places where the waiters seem to believe you serve them and not vice versa.Definitely one of the better restaurants on Upper St, but relatively poor service and the dessert menu mean this place only gets 4 stars in my book. \u00a0Thank you yelp for bringing this restaurant to my attention!",

I don't think I've ever enjoyed food in a restaurant so much.Let's just stop to think about that for a second: enjoying food in a restaurant. \u00a0When the food arrives, you clap your hands with glee, because it looks so beautiful. \u00a0Ravenous, you stab your fork into the colourful, fresh melee before you, and then - food in mouth, you stop, and sigh a little, and with your mouth closed, make frantic \"MM-MMTRYTHIS!\" noises at your eating partner. \u00a0IT'S THAT GOOD!Roasted eggplant with confit d'orange? \u00a0Truly one of the most amazing flavour combinations I've had. \u00a0Roast peaches with young goat's cheese and radicchio... Courgettes somehow infused with buttery garlic, paired with basil and amazing pistachios.... Roast pork belly with perfectly crispy skin... A luminous, ruby-red loin of tuna, wrapped in nori and wasabi, with some crazyamazing salsa...This isn't just one of those restaurants that hits a really good farmer's market, washes the produce, and artfully arranges it on a plate (River Cafe, I'm looking in your direction) - this food is more labour-intensive, more flavour-intensive. \u00a0Their desserts are even better than they look in the window (quite a feat there); the wine list featured a whole bunch of wines I've never heard of, and every one I've tried is great, so, interesting wine list?To really confirm my approbation - upon arrival, they provide a range of breads, and some olive oil... the bread? \u00a0Completely, 100%, slow-fermentation, chewy creamy crusty PERFECTION. \u00a0Best bread in London! \u00a0You had me at 'bread'! \u00a0etc etc!",

While I first came in to taste these aforementioned mysterious, obese meringues...the ADD kicked in immediately upon entry and I was forced to rob the place of other goods. \u00a0The egg tarts are delicious, as well as the various muffins that they have. \u00a0But the most memorable thing I've shoveled into my gluttonous self is the quinoa with sundried tomatoes and sweet potatoes. \u00a0Absolutely mindblowing, fresh food - it is almost painful to see such gourmet stuff displayed out in open trays, a la school cafeteria slush. \u00a0I resisted the urge to jump in front of these silver housings and protect them from the nasties such as bugs and swine flu. Definitely a great place to get some dessert and top off a meal, or a quick lunchbox full of hearty and flavorful food. \u00a0Just don't expect a lazy Sunday brunch in here, since you'll most likely feel guilty about taking up too much bench space with your ever expanding butt line (thanks to Ottolenghi)",

You have to save room for dessert especially if macadamia caramel cheesecake is available.The room itself is casual with a couple large shared tables and a few for smaller parties. I personally love the clean whiteness of the place...it makes the food jump out at you.The biggest compliment I think I can give them is if I could eat this everyday, I don't think I would have a problem becoming a vegetarian.",

I had brought a vegan friend who'd been starving her way across Europe on her holiday and I wanted to her to eat some good food. Luckily after her trip so far she was relaxing her strict veganism. So I ordered every vegetable dish on the menu - though not vegan they only had small bits of cheese.COLD DISHESGreen beansbroccoli/zucchini/\u00adtrufflesauberginequince saladbeetsOut of these our favorite was the broccolini and zucchini with truffles (of course!) though they were all really good.

We were told we only had the table for a certain time...which is fine if you are speedy with the ordering. We sat for a bit and waited and then someone came by and said have you been here before and are you familiar with how to order? Then instead of taking our order, he walked away. We then had another person a few minutes later ask the same question but at least he took our order.Although we didn't care much for the service, the food was excellent.

Turned out the whole thing was a misunderstanding because so many people show up at the restaurant wanting just dessert - there were available seats for someone ordering dinner! After clearing this up I was promptly seated; so make sure you ask. On to the food - it didn't disappoint. Just about everything I ordered, meat, sides, desserts, was fabulous.

    "text": "Ottolenghi is another place where the value proposition for takeaway is probably better than eating in. I come here frequently to grab takeaway boxes where you can choose 3 salads for around \u00a311.50, but you have to understand that their salads are not really salads, and probably best described as vegetarian dishes. Where you go wrong is if you try to order the meat, as they usually have a beef, salmon, or seared tuna, and that's accidentally managed to add another \u00a36 to my bill on more than one occasion, and that was just for a small bite! Now that was an expensive lunch. My top picks of the salads are the roasted aubergine and the butternut squash. But I came here for dinner the other evening (where you can book!) and there is a whole other side of the menu consisting of the hot dishes prepared on site. We were advised that the plates are like tapas, and advised to get 2-3 each (I always lowball and so we ended up getting 5). Bread was complimentary, which was different than when I went to Ottolenghi Spitalfields for lunch and had to pay for it. The olive oil is delightful. From the counter, we ordered the roasted aubergine, which is poor value at \u00a39 to eat in for a small portion, about the size you'd get as 1/3 of the salad box. And from the kitchen, we ordered the pea and mint croquettes, pan fried sea bass, char grilled tiger prawns, and roast pork belly. The pea and mint croquettes were particularly interesting, as you don't see that very often and you would have never guessed what was in it. I'd say of the meat dishes, I liked the tiger prawns the most, but all were delicious. And my favourite part of the meal is that they have a selection of orange wine here, which is an uncommon find in London! I'd only had it once before and we tried the A Demua, which was a bit dry for my normal tastes but it was nice to try something new. That said, dining in here is a rather expensive proposition, and I'm not such a big fan of the long table seating arrangement, where there was never a prayer of fitting all of our plates on our little allocated area of space, so my preference remains for takeaway.",

An eye-opening experience.I'm not a huge fan of communal tables, so like to book the single tables on the side, but otherwise, it's my favorite place to meet friends for a dinner date, or as a treat - especially if someone's visiting from out of town.",

    "text": "My dad's old friend brought us to Ottolenghi because it was yet ANOTHER hot day in London and I asked for something light. I had never heard of the place, but I certainly have now.I ordered the small lunch selection of salads - 3 salads. I felt so overwhelmed by the options, especially as they aren't my traditional types of salads. These were the most colorful and exciting salad combinations I had ever heard, and I'll admit I was REALLY quite intimidated by a salad that didn't follow the recipe of greens + other stuff. In the end, what helped me make my decision was ordering all the POMEGRANATE salads:- Roasted aubergine w/ saffron yoghurt, hazelnuts, pomegranate seeds, mixed basil = DELICIOUS. Roasted aubergine (eggplant) was done so well, and it tasted much better than I thought it would cold. Delicious delicious.- Kohlrabi, carrot & red cabbage slaw, passion fruit & pomegranate dressing = quite good. I've never had kohlrabi, but I liked the dressing a lot, and this was the closest to the traditional salads I've had. Crisp and fresh.- Purple & yellow cauliflower with almonds, pomegranate seeds, orange blossom dressing = very tasty indeed. Not much else to say about it but I liked it a lot. The more untraditional cauliflower colours made it extra fun for me.In addition to my 3 salads, we also had a bread board, which was pretty delicious.ON TO THE IMPORTANT PART. THE DESSERTS.I have to say that the highlight was really the salads on this hot day, but the desserts in the window are so difficult to turn a blind eye towards.I had myself a delicious cake. I don't quite recall the name was. It was orange-y and so light and fluffy. oh it was so lovely. (EDIT: 2 years later I remember, it was the orange chiffon cake!)I'LL BE BACK!",

Grilled Aubergine with a massala yoghurt and pomegranate was sensation ale and one of us HATES Aubergine so a pretty good result. \u00a0The pork belly with kimchi was the star of the show. \u00a0But everything else was, while enjoyable, simply not very memorable.It all felt rather worthy and healthy and solidly adding to you five-a-day but I can't help feeling that plastic seats, white benches, pre-prepared dishes and not very attentive service was worth that kind of cash.We will go again, and I'm sure we'll enjoy it again but don't take your next hot date there for a meal if you want to impress.

Ottolenghi is quaint and cozy and don't even think about coming here for dinner unless you make reservations. I didn't know this, but Mike (I think that's his name) made some magic happen and found us some seats near the front of the restaurant. Every dish here is meant to be shared and everything is a bit out of the ordinary. Everything on the menu raised an eyebrow making me question what exactly it is I was ordering but with the recommendations from our server, everything turned out okay. Since all the dishes are relatively small portioned, you have to expect to spend some extra dough for the experience and slightly bizarre dishes. Some things my friends and I ordered were the seared scallops and the yellow fin, which I thought were the two best. The Smokey Miso broth, Red and Yellow Beetroot, and Roasted Aubergine were good but they weren't as compelling as the other two.As for the service, I was blown away. Service tends to be quite sh*tty here in London, and the staff at Ottolenghi were pleasant in a way that made me feel at home in this city so kudos to them for that. They provide great food and service which makes it no wonder why they're rated so highly on Yelp.",

I ordered the (1) Pumpkin and puy lentil mash with fried shallots, goat's cheese and herbs, which was my favorite of the three (2) smoked aubergine and nigella seed croquettes with tarragon aioli, which was tasty - especially because of the aioli, and (3) char-grilled tiger prawns, tom yum sauce, kohlrabi and shiitake mushrooms, which was delicious and had more shrimp than I expected. This place is also very vegetarian friendly and makes vegetables taste so good. Definitely make a reservation ahead of time. Overall: AMAZING food, creative, lots of fresh veggies, a must-go.",

Also, the desserts... I'm not normally into sweets but even I couldn't resist their caramel and chocolate tart, which tasted as good as it looked - sticky, dark caramel beneath a silky smooth dark chocolate ganache in a short-crust chocolate pastry.

Ottolenghi definitely stands out in the London restaurant scene, just make sure you have a way of scoring a seat. \u00a0We had a hookup help us get reservations but otherwise I hear it's damn near impossible.",

    "text": "Had a fabulous meal here last week. Particularly good because we had a vegetarian in our group - usually the vegetarian gets to pick from a couple of choices but here, half the plates were available for him! Our group of four tried 11 of the 15 offerings the night we went and I would say 4 or 5 were stunners, and the rest were quite good. Even a dish as ubiquitous as beets with goat cheese was particularly tasty in its simplicity and freshness. And the pork belly had that crackling crispness that makes you sit quietly after you take a bite, and just enjoy the experience in your mouth. I don't really have a sweet tooth, so I can't say the carrot cake blew me away, but the Ottolenghi hot chocolate was the best I've ever had - not too sweet and with a deeply flavorful richness in each sip.The prices aren't cheap, but the value is high. I would recommend going with several people so you can try more of the dishes on offer. Also, be prepared to sit at a long table with other patrons.",

If you're too healthy to not salivate on sight of the amazing display of cakes in the window, I dare you not to be impressed by the oodles of salads piled high next to it. Steps to take you to Ottolenghi heaven:Step 1. Bag a table. It may involve queuing but my tip is to go for lunch - it's mostly the same food as dinner, but at a much more reasonable price. (NB takeaway is an option).Step 2. Pick your food. \u00a0At lunch this is mainly cold food from the counter but at dinner food comes from the kitchen too. I personally love the counter salads - usually you go for 3 or 4. You can inspect them and pick your order on how they look. They are incredibly vivid and colourful, and are packed with Middle Eastern inspired flavours. I personally love anything with aubergine or pomegranates. Step 3. Eat, enjoy, appreciate the scrummyness. Then think about eating even more food with dessert. \u00a0Step 4. Repeat steps 2 - 3 with the desserts on display.Step 5. Die happy.",

Low key in morning but hard to get in at night at their fabulous communal table or a private one.I have been here for all meals of the day. The breakfast is calm and lovely, with hearty egg/bread dishes, and sweet ones like muesli with tahini. The shakshuka is a bit oily and comes out piping hot but worth every bite. Dinner is the best, when the small (slightly pricey) dishes come from the counter or the kitchen. The vegetable dishes are creative and fresh and tantalizing! I will remember the smokey eggplant with tamarind yogurt, the broccolini with Chillin, the seared tuna with sesame, and the courageous with pistachios for long to come.I dare you to try to resist dessert (but don't!) as the cakes and pastries are all out of this world. You might want some to go. Service is perfect, attentive, helpful and kind servers. Not cheap but somewhat reasonable for the area. And unquestionably worth it for the quality!",

It might look like the most expensive salad in London when you see the price-tag on the menu (\u00a317), but meat + 3 sides is plenty for two to share!! Skipping the aubergine would be crazy as it's the best I've ever tried in London (and I'm not the only one thinking so as our waitress pretty much shouted \"the aubergine\" when asked for recommendations!!). The cheesecake is pretty ace too. Oh, and they're currently doing Peanut Butter Smore's. You only live one, so go and grab one (or twelve) before it's too late! The staff is great and very attentive, I don't think I've ever had my water glass refilled so often without having to ask for it! And they let me stare at the cake for as long as I need to make my decision (aka a VERY long time)...cakeandwhisky.wordpress.\u2026",

The place was rammed and I was worried we wouldn't get a seat. I only had to wait for about 5 minutes to be seated. The restaurant had a large table in the middle with smaller tables round the edges. We got placed at the large table (picture sitting at Wagamamas with people either side of you). Despite the close proximity and loud gossipers, I didn't mind - I had a good feeling about this place.The lunch menu offered a variety of cold meats and salads. I ordered a main (salmon) with two salads (sweet potato and aubergine). The waiter mentioned that their salmon was on the small side so they wouldn't be charging for the main, which was a nice touch. Who wants to go back to the office stuffed anyway? The staff were really attentive and didn't allow my glass of water to drop below the half way point so you can't die of thirst here! The food arrived pretty sharpish and the salmon was not small so I was impressed! The food went down a treat! And to top it off, the discount was a really nice gesture.I thoroughly recommend this place for a quick, fresh and tasty lunch!",

I must admit, I let my dining companions do most of the deciding in terms of food, wine, etc. (However, I definitely made my own dessert choices!) This is my preferred way to dine, especially with \"foodies\" and especially those \"foodies\" that were so kind to secure the reservation in the first place. I will say though -- everything that passed my very pleased palate was perfect. The menu is curated well, just the right amount of choice without being overwhelming. I particularly enjoyed the sea bass and the aubergine dishes, but all were lovely. We got good guidance from our server, and everything arrived at the right temperature, without taking too long. *This is a sharing restaurant. Non-sharers, be warned! The real treat though -- the DESSERTS (and the wine, but I'm on a low-wine diet until the baby arrives). The cheescake with rhubarb was a revelation. The coconut macaron? MARVELOUS. The Bailey's chocolate cake? I'd get drunk on that any night of the week. Such masterful desserts, I'd come straight back just for them. I will actually do that. A very reasonable \u00a350/pp with 2 bottles of wine, about 8-10 dishes and 4 desserts. Quite a good value considering the high marks Ottolenghi receives.

Yotam Ottolenghi is a culinary genius and an advocate of Slow Food, ie he makes things on the premises, using good, clean and fair ingredients and he really knows how to cook. It is both a place to pick up provisions for takeaway e.g. amazing cakes, wonderful bread, sandwiches, home made crossiants, the best meringues in the world, amazing salads full of fresh and exciting flavours and so much more. Alternatively, you can eat at the long communal table and enjoy breakfast (a toaster is brought to your table and a panoply of amazing jams and fresh bread), lunch or dinner. The menu changes regularly and features local, seasonal delights with a largely though not exclusively vegetarian bent. It may be grim up north, but with Ottolenghi at least it's also yummy.",

I also noticed that the restaurant was still completely packed at this time of the night and more people were coming in for their late night reservations.Shortly after we sat down, we were introduced to the menu by a very helpful and friendly staff and some complimentary bread. The menu changes from time to time and features no more than 20 items that come in tapas sized portions, half are served from the counter (aka cold plates), while hot dishes are made to serve from the kitchen. It was recommended that each person order 2-3 items.The highlight of the night were the cold dishes we shared. In particular, the roasted aubergine with zhoug, amba, tahini, and pita croutons were the best I've ever tasted. The flavors were surprising, exotic and inventive. This was true for all of his other dishes. The mozzarella di bufala paired with peaches and grapefruit is also a must-try. A spoonful of the creamy cheese and grilled peaches had a well-balanced and unique medley of flavors.For the hot dishes, the pork belly is a must. It was very well seasoned and the crackling pork skin was very crispy. The mango and pickled ginger that came with it helped to provide a balanced palette of flavors and cut the fattiness of the pork belly. We also got the goat which was delicious and not gamey at all. The medley of mushrooms was incredibly flavorful and exotic. I recommend getting more bread to dip in the mushroom sauce!I was pretty full after the hot dishes but we knew we couldn't skip dessert. After going up to the display and inquiring about every dessert they had, we settled on an apple and raisin slice, lemon and poppy cheesecake and a plum meringue. My favorite was the apple and raisin slice. It's sweet, delicate and flavorful. I recommend adding the complimentary vanilla custard to this!Overall, Ottolenghi's dishes were yummy, inventive and exceeded my expectations. It's definitely a must-try in London and I'll be looking into NOPI (Ottolenghi's higher end restaurant) after this!",

    "text": "One of my main reasons for traveling to London was to try an Ottolenghi restaurant. Maybe I hyped it up too much, but my experience at the Islington location was subpar for the caliber of this place. The restaurant itself was tastefully decorated and modern. The staff were cold, impersonal, and seemed always rushed for the low number of patrons. The food, although beautiful as ever, tasted bland and left a lot to be desired. Maybe it was a one-off but it steered me away from trying it for breakfast the next day.",

    "text": "There really is nothing wrong with ottolenghi. The only but you could find is price, but to be honest, for the quality of the food you get, I think it's well justified.I've been here many times throughout the years, but I recently called in to pick up a few cakes for a friends birthday. I called ahead to make sure I could come pick them up after work (and that they'd still have a good selection). They confirmed both and I rocked up at 7pm on a Tuesday to find a full selection of sweet treats still looking lovely and fresh as always.I got the classic flourless bundt cake, a must. I tried the caramelised pineapple cheesecake - gorgeous and super fluffy. One of my favourite new discoveries was the mascarpone lemon tart (but it's a lot smaller than the other two or so it seemed). The last cake was the pistachio polenta mini loaf. It wasn't my cup of tea personally, didn't like the texture or flavour as much as the others, but it was still good.4 cakes came to around \u00a317 so, again, not the cheapest in London but if you're going to sin might as well do it in style!",

    "text": "High praise all around. We made a reservation and so were seated at a private table. While the location was indeed nicely set off from the communal tables, it seems there was on this particular evening a communal table suited for families - those with children 6 and under - and another w adults only. We were beside the former and thus the noise level was quite high. That being said, the food and service much surpassed the slight disturbances to our side and we were absolutely thrilled with the experience overall. The vibe is both casual and sophisticated with a side of quirkiness. Our server was a gallant fellow who was warm and patient, and advised us to order 4-5 of the dishes. Not one of the items were familiar so we shot in the dark and selected a radicchio salad, the smoked lamb rump, cornish squid stew, and a cool turnip plate. We paired this w some orange wine (a first) and ginger beer. A variety of fresh bread slices were offered w extra virgin olive oil. I cannot say enough about the flavors. Inventive. Whimsical. Unctious. Surprising. The radicchio came heavily seasoned but it all worked with cubes of watermelon to really bring a punch of freshness to it. The turnip plate was incredibly flavorful and had me wondering if I had in fact ever eaten turnip properly because this was fantastic. I never order lamb as I consider it far too gamey but I thought if there was ever a place to try it, this was it, and I was not disappointed. It was perfectly medium rare and delicate and tasty. The cornish stew was a bit of a wild card and I avoided it for a bit as it came out looking like steaming black pudding but once I had a spoonful, I was cleaning the bowl dry. YUM. We rounded out the filling yet well portioned meal w the laphroaig and almond and orange cake w vanilla cream. The dessert was probably the least innovative and a bit dry but I concede it might have been a judgement relative to the truly unique and well executed dishes that preceded. I've already made a reservation for 2 weeks out at another location. I intend to try them all!",

( yey ... Not ) Moving on , they have a limited tiny menu The salads are :Roasted broccoli Coliflower slaw with mango Bean salad drenched in oilRoasted sweet potatoAnd 3 more ....The can accommodate food allergies but they can't give you dressing on the side so there you have it !!!The waitress was rude and condescending beyond belief I am so glad our waiter was so nice and polite !!!The place is cool with big tables \u00a0and funky furniture but the prices are very very high for \u00a0the portions you get. There are olives and hummus you can order as appetizers. The desserts and cakes looked amazing but we passed. I has a cheese crisp which was great but man !!! 3.40 ????? Are you kidding me ???? They brought it to the table because I saw it on my way in but didn't see the price ....Never ever ever ever ever again",

Definitely get the ricotta stuffed courgette flowers. I LOVE these. The rest of the menu changes a lot but you can see the cold dishes on the counter and then they have some hot dishes from the kitchen. Everything was fantastic. King prawns were perfectly cooked with a delicious sauce. The roast aubergine had a great texture with a yummy feta yoghurt. Tip: Save room for dessert! The baked goods are outstanding. We shared a delicious apple and maple icing cake and a hazelnut cake. Both so moist! We got four more desserts to take away as we were going to a bbq the next day - they were all fantastic - especially the rum and choc cake and carrot cake. Go Go Go!",

It was super close to my flat, but is absolutely worth going out of your way. The best vegetables I've ever had in my life. It's not cheap, but the small takeaway box is a very filling meal. I especially loved the eggplant and the sweet potatoes.I also grabbed a piece of a plum tart with almond paste, and a piece of ham and stilton quiche to have for breakfast the next day. Both were super delicious, although the stilton was a little too much when I was in that transitional still drunk/verging toward hungover state at 4am waiting for my Eurostar train.

It's a go to spot every time I visit.I've been for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and I've enjoyed everything I've ordered. The salad plates stand out for me - they're really creative and you feel good about yourself after.

The eggs came back \"over hard\". \u00a0In my opinion every line cook in the world should know how to fry eggs in the 3 common styles \"over easy\" \"over hard\" and \"sunny side up\". \u00a0However is you order what's on the menu, I don't think you'll go wrong, and the menu items are a big part of what makes this place special.",

They have the best vegetarian options! We shared 3 cold dishes, all phenomenal but the highlight was the cabbage slaw with crispy onions. We shared four hot dishes, and the fourth was our second crispy beef because we had to order another! We then shared an olive oil cake and a chocolate caramel tart which were out of this world. The atmosphere is lovely, the service is fantastic, and the bathrooms are clean. What more could you ask for in a restaurant?",

    "text": "Made dinner reservations in April for a June 7:30pm Fri time slot. After so many people raving about this place, I had to bite the bullet to wait a couple months and try it out. It lived up to all the hype so I was happy to have finally tried it. I thought the food was tasty and the ambiance was great. I didn't mind the long table at the center. We were at the very inside end of the table so it was nice not to have a free side. The food- definitely well made and ingredients were perfectly put together and tasted so balanced and gooooood. I couldn't get enough! The cold dishes were surprisingly good because I didn't think that something that is out on a massive spread at the front of the restaurant could be that great. But it was. The steak, tuna, and aubergines were my favorites. I was skeptical about the steak, but it was good even cold! The dips that were paired with the steak and tuna were perf. I wasn't crazy about the beetroot, so I'd skip it (you are, after all, spending \u00a39-\u00a311 for these small little starter plates where elsewhere these could be main prices and a lot more food, so pick your favs....we wanted to try everything so we took the hit).For the hot dishes, must have the lobster dish and quail. The quail surprised me because I thought it would be majority bones, but it was nice and meaty...for quail. The mackerel dish was interesting. I liked that squid ink was used for this dish. For dessert, had the orange cake and it was good. I'm not a fan with desserts or chocolate mixed with any type of orange flavor, but this was delic. Also ordered a dessert wine (Ramblis dessert wine, \u00a35), and it was Tiny. I get that it's dessert wine and it's not filled like regular dinner wine, but I felt like there was barely much to drink to taste, sip on, and enjoy. I would of ordered another cake dessert if I would have known.All in all, this place is good. It's clearly proven itself for it's food and cakes and it's won me over for sure. The only thing is, is that it's pricey. I would maaaybe come here on special occasions, but for the amount we paid and the small little plates, I'd rather go to my other \"pricey\" places that are much worth it. But it was great to try! I recommend it to any first timers. *Make reservations (for dinner)!",

I liked the salad and breads and wine, but I LOVE THE CAKES. Come here and eat cake. Cake. Cake. Cake .",

You will never miss it when you walk past the front of this delicious little restaurant: where on one side a buffet is laden with a mouthwatering range of different cold vegetable and meat delicacies, and the other side are plates and plates of desserts of all shapes and sizes and colour. If you have a love for food, this is a place you need to try. You can clearly see the seriousness of how the food is presented and the amalgam of ingredients used for each dish. \u00a0All made from scratch, their lunch menu of cold dishes are stunning. The dishes change constantly, and include such things as, 'spiced lamb and apricot filo pocket, served with mint yoghurt', 'seared lamb skewer with grilled spring onion, and tahini sauce' , \u00a0'young Pecorino wrapped in Parma ham and rocket, with Lavender honey'. They also have a take away service for both the desserts and buffet, as well as a catering facility. Just going for a coffee and one, or two of their desserts is a rewarding experience, though maybe not for the waist line! Their carrot cake is scrumptious and their cupcakes, large and spongy. Their breakfasts are delightful as well, where I once had a croissant and cappuccino, and a huge plate of scrambled eggs served with a side of watercress, with the the nicest sesame oil dressing. Now I must try their dinner menu which looks just as good as everything else Ottolenghi has to offer.",

Service was quick and attentive without being intrusive - had a great casual feel. \u00a0The meals were great - my tuna was well cooked and very nice while my dining companions had the chicken and the lentil burgers, both of which were very good. \u00a0The real stars of the meal were the salads, though - very fresh and flavourful and left us guessing what might be hidden in there. \u00a0Desserts were also good - one we'd picked had sold out by the time they got to us but the replacement choice was as tasty as the other looked. \u00a0For seventy pounds for lunch for three (without wine) it's not going to be somewhere we go every week but certainly next time we're in the neighbourhood.",

Unfortunately, I haven't had particularly good encounters with the staff here. The first time, I tried to go for tea and cakes with some friends, but the woman at the door was very snooty and dismissive, like we had to grovel or something. There were plenty of free seats, but she said something about it being the changeover from lunch and said she could squeeze us in if we waited about 20 minutes. We really didn't like her attitude so took our business to Carluccio's instead and had some very nice cakes there. The next time I went, we did get in but they sat us right at the end of a large table (where we felt quite exposed \u00a0there was nobody else sitting on it, and there were tables for two available elsewhere). They then started to move all the furniture around in a flurry of activity (they change it for evening service apparently). It was very disruptive and they completely forgot to bring us our order! I had to go and tap someone on the shoulder to remind them in the end. They were very huffy and not very apologetic. Honestly! I find the staff here very superior indeed (in a bad way), I don't know where they find them. Perhaps they are out-of-work actors, they certainly act like drama queens. I hope the food is worth all the kerfuffle, the cake certainly wasn't. And it was very expensive too. I won't hurry back.",

So far, so granola-eating Guardian-reading yawn, you might say, but the proof of the salad is in the mastication and in this case he, she, it or they have got it exactly right. As far as I can tell, this little chain of eateries takes its influences and style from the Med southern Europe and northern Africa, with lots of little spices and tangs to transform humble dishes into bold flavoursome experiences. I've only been to the Upper Street one but I'm sure the other outlets pull off this clever feat with similarly accomplished aplomb. I won't even try to list dishes because they usually come with about 14 different ingredients which somehow pull together to create something very special. It's fantastic for brunch or lunch, not wallet-shrinkingly expensive, and usually pretty friendly and welcoming. A perfect place to take your loved one for a Saturday brunch-type canoodle.

They have extraordinary breakfast as well. I little pricey but a must-go.",

    "text": "What: brunch.When: a nondescript Wednesday morning.With: my two best female friends.It's lovely to go luxe for brunch when it's cold and miserable outside. My friends and I met here, a short walk from Highbury & Islington station (Victoria line), to celebrate an engagement. The blonde had the eggs and smoked salmon, the brunette had the cinnamon french toast, and I had the bread board (yes, we love our carbohydrates). We also asked our waitress if they could make us some mimosas (they weren't listed on the menu) to celebrate the blonde's engagement -- they could, they did, and they were yummy.Be prepared to sit at communal tables (\u00e0 la Pain Quotidien) and under the connecting cables of the toast-it-yourself bread toasters at each end. Be prepared for the waitresses to offer you three different menus (two of our waitresses were confused whether we were there for breakfast or lunch, and another waitress figured we would benefit from more choice). Be prepared for the unisex bathrooms...Aside from those preparations, the flagship restaurant of Yotam Ottolenghi seems a very pleasant space. Mr O graced us with his presence (surely very unusual for most namesake restaurateurs?) and the whole restaurant was abuzz with contented eaters. Everything smelled delicious. Alas, I was too full from our carbo-centric brunch to eat it all -- but I got a pain au chocolat to take home, which -- now that it is tea time -- tastes DIVINE.It's a little pricier than your average caf\u00e9, but then again it's not an average caf\u00e9: it's Ottolenghi's flagship restaurant, and a darn good place for brunch. Looking forward to eat dinner here very soon...[p.s. You don't need to sit down to eat. They do lots of yummy take-away things. We pressed our noses against the window for a while before we left. Oh, Mr O :) ]",

The Ottolenghi empire specializes in drool-inducing window displays and the food does not disappoint.This is one Ottolenghi where you can sit down and eat with table service. Beware, though. It's incredibly popular, so come early (11:30) or be prepared to wait. One thoughtful staffer was handing out pieces of breadsticks to hungry patrons in line.If you're like me, and you love vegetables, meat, and dessert, this place is for you. For lunch/brunch, you'll get your choice of 2-4 delicious vegetable salads with or without a piece of meat or fish. You will be stuffed.I had the salmon, plus three vegetable dishes: aubergine with tomato, butternut squash with sour cream and paprika, and sesame green beans.I'd recommend this place for vegetarians and vegans.Gluten-free notes: Most of the food here is naturally gluten-free. And when you look in the window to see plates piled high with gorgeous baked goods, smile. A good number are gluten-free! I've tried the poleta cake, fondant chocolat, and chocolate tea cake. All are delicious, moist, and wonderful. They don't bill them as \"gluten-free\" with any sort of sign, so just ask. Your gluten-eating friends would know that they are delicious and not guess that they happen not to contain wheat.",

Definitley try the sea bass and the prawns....so flavourful and well prepared. I think I dreamt about the later that evening. My friend raved about his spicy aubergine appetizer.Desserts looked amazing (check out all the meringues in the window). I had a passion fruit meringue tarte that was simply delightful and paired with an equally nice dessert wine.Ottolenghi was packed for dinner (well it was Saturday night), but they made room for us on this massive long common table.

I have the \"Plenty More\" cookbook at home, so I had high expectations for the meal. \u00a0I am a vegetarian and I went with two carnivores. We ended up getting 3 veggie plates and 4 meat, and all ended up stuffed. I personally enjoyed the brocolini, pea and mint fritters, and the carrot puree. Each dish glorified the vegetable at it's center and made me reassess my understanding of flavor combinations. It's the kind of cooking that inspires you to be better to your food in the kitchen, and that gave me a certain high from the real goodness of the meal. It shouldn't be a surprise that anyone I tell about this restaurant is trapped for at least 15 minutes while I go into a reverie about my experience. It's not an inexpensive night out, but it's worth every penny for the genius of the cooking done here!!!!!",

I love walking in past the days' arrangement of salads and cakes, it's a great way to get your appetite going. The displays seem like they should belong to an old French patisserie but for some reason they fit in beautifully with these ultra modern and sleek surroundings. In fact, the only thing I dislike about Ottolenghi is that everyone else loves it so much too. Queue's here can be an absolute nightmare and because there is such a limited seating space they don't tend to move very quickly either. The staff are very aware of this though and very attentive to the queue. I've even known them to walk up and down distributing nibbles which really does make the time pass a bit faster. The popularity of Ottolenghi is also reflected in its prices and a bowl of soup will set you back \u00c2\u00a36. Don't be too put off by this though as the quality of cooking is really high and while it might be a bit too expensive to visit every day, it's perfect for a special occasion. If you're ever in for breakfast try the mushrooms with feta as a side dish, a little extravagant but absolutely lovely!",

    "text": "Summary: Good food, pricey, cool interior.Tried this place for breakfast twice. Once as a sit down meal for the brioche french toast w/ berry compote and greek yogurt, and a second time for takeaway almond croissant.The french toast was good, but not phenomenal. This may be stylistic preference, but the bread wasn't custardy and soaked through. The bread seemed like it was dipped in egg wash for a few seconds and then cooked, so the center was still dry. The compote was good, but even better were the various spreads (butter, banana compote, thick hazelnut chocolate spread w/ whole hazelnuts, and berry jam) on the table. Banana compote + hazelnut chocolate spread on french toast is a pretty solid combo.Almond croissant was good, but not the best I've had. The outside wasn't consistently flaky. Some pieces were, some weren't. The center had a massive amount of marzipan - I think I prefer a thinner layer in the middle.Separately, I've also gone to the Kensington location a few times and tried the savory pesto muffin (great) and various cakes (good).Food overall was good, but given the price premium (and reputation, although I suppose it's a bit unfair to judge based on reputation), I expected consistently great if not phenomenal food.Interior was pretty cool - clean, crisp white interior. Beautiful layout of the baked goods. Had seating. See the photos for details.Would come by again, but probably wouldn't go out of my way. Food was good overall, but pricey for what it was.",

The cafe is quite small with a large food display area at the front and tables at the back. There is one large, communal central table that occupies much of the seating area. I came a few weeks ago for a late lunch with a friend. It is a sort of buffet where you choose your food from a combination of dishes. The food is healthy Italian with a good range of salads. We had a glass of the house/cheapest white with our food which was surprisingly good: delicate, poly tonal and all that. As one might expect from this sort of place, the people can sometimes be unbearably bourgeois, which can mean conversations about whether to send Ralph private or public, which is fine but can be a bit of a chore if you're sitting on the communal table. A pleasant place that does simple, good quality Italian food well, though if you're going try to avoid yuppie rush.",

    "text": "Upper Street famously has some statistic along the lines of the most restaurants per yuppie in London so in theory it should be incredibly easy to get a great meal there. Sadly, many of the restaurants are sad pseudo-trendy relics serving decidedly mediocre food. However this cannot be said of Ottolenghi, a relatively recent gem of a restaurant. Your mouth starts watering as you walk up to the window, where tasty treats are piled high in a mouth-watering display, including gigantic meringues, mad enough to be straight from the pages of Alice in Wonderland. The decor is cool, mimimalist white, seating at one long white table down the centre of the room, providing the perfect no-fuss backdrop to the delicious food. Fresh and inventive salads are the savoury speciality - although it's not strictly a vegetarian restaurant, anyone with vegetarian friends to cook for should come here for inspiration in how to cook real, interesting food for non meat-eaters. Although the savoury food is worth the journey alone, it's worth saving space for pudding as the cakes are deliciously home-made tasting (if you lived with Nigella Lawson, Delia Smith and Nigel Slater or something) and gorgeously displayed. The brownies are my personal favourite and if you can't manage anything straight away, you can always take away to eat later at home.",

She seemed unconvinced as we walked toward Upper St., and was obviously scoping out other potential dining options along the way. But I persevered, and she was audibly impressed by the magical myriad of sweets in the window when we finally reached our destination. The attentive staff quickly accommodated us in spite of our lack of reservation and my long list of food allergies. We perched at the bar and enjoyed two very interesting reds recommended by our cordial server from their impressive list. We started with the green and yellow bean salad, the beet and pistachio salad, then she had the duck egg in miso and I had the peanut-crusted tofu. Everything we ordered was fresh, perfectly prepared and seasoned, beautifully presented, and utterly delicious. For dessert, we had a pretty amusing exchange with another member of the staff (floor manager, perhaps?) who was excited to discuss the amount of alcohol in some of the baked goods. My co-worker's eyes lit up as he recommended an individual cake--I think he said it had Bailey's, some rum, and even perhaps a dash of Guinness in it--served with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. \u00a0\"I believe you've taken me for a boozer, sir,\" my co-worker said, \"and I think I'd like to go with your recommendation.\" While my co-worker attempted to make her way through the 80-proof cake, I enjoyed a fresh mint tisane and the fig salad for dessert. She managed to finish about half of the cake, but not because it wasn't delicious. We'd already sampled a good cross-section of the menu, and she physically couldn't eat any more (plus I think she might have worried that I'd need to fireman-carry her back to the hotel). She probably would have taken the leftovers with her if we'd had a mini-fridge in the room.Ottolenghi was definitely the best dining experience we had during our recent stay in London, and I highly recommend it--especially if you're recovering from jet lag and need some pampering, or if you have a hankering for amazing food and boozy cake.",

    "text": "Ottolenghi feels like the restaurant's equivalent of a shopping mall. There are people everywhere, the general staff is indifferent, and you choose several items which appear almost instantly, after which you are quickly ushered out on a conveyer belt so the next customers can have the same experience. Crowded seating leads to severe social claustrophobia and makes one want to eat as quickly as possible so as to escape watching other customers do the same. The food is creative, fine, but that's just one component to fine dining, and this is not a fine dining experience for anyone who does not have a Charles Darwin-length beard and a copy of Finnegan's Wake on hand.",

It is usually a bit of a faff when I eat because I need to avoid gluten but it was a wonderful experience. The wine was delicious. We were too full for dessert but we did manage to buy some cakes on the way out for later. No problem with a gluten free cake and they provided a candle for my husband's birthday bun which was really sweet. ~Go for the food and the atmosphere.",

We were quickly seated and presented with menus and the ordering began. As it's sharing (and between four of us), we tried most every dish on the menu. Some were better than others, but nothing stood out enough that we wanted to order it again. In fact, overall, we were pretty disappointed. The food was good but not amazing. The service was apathetic at best and brazenly up-selling at worst, and at the end of it we were left still feeling a little bit hungry.For the price and the ambiance (elbow-to-elbow communal long-tables), portion sizes are too small: 4small slices of beef fillet or 2 lamb popsicles isn't a great deal for \u00a311; esp if the flavour and presentation don't blow you away.I'd not rush to go back and if I did, it's probably going to be at lunchtime for the great salad selection.

    "text": "Ohhh!!! Ottolenghi. Oh to have met earlier in the day. Oh my gracious, Oh a Plenty. Having had a sad time at an eatery nearby, I knew all would be well again having coffee and dessert here. No booking required as many suggest, a risk at almost closing time, but staff were wonderfully welcoming, despite no doubt having a stonkingly busy day and dealing with Oohs and Aaahhs and indecisive patrons ogling the plethora of treats. Nigella, my heroine, you and your Lemon Polenta cake can go fly a kite. After momentarily scanning an abundant array of delights, what caught my eye in what I think is akin to the Selfridges Christmas window display of carbs against a clean landscape of white, was one last solitary seductive treasure on a winning pedestal. There were lots of other delicious looking things, but this, be still my excited taste buddies. Crowning this glory, wearing a glossy dark coat of chocolate ganache, underneath I could tell it was moist even from a distance; Ottolenghi's polenta cake was an orange almond offering with a few chicly positioned toasted slivers of almond teetering on the edge, as was I. There was a small queue, I was beginning to bite my lip in anticipation that someone may take this last beauty before I managed to order. The waitress efficiently showed us to our seats, \" Just to let you know we're closing in 20 minu-\", (never have I been so quick to order with a menu in my hands) \"I know what I'd like and I'll be so eternally pleased if it can be mine, it's the last-\"Almond, Orange, Polenta, I'll go take it for you now\". She finished off my sentence and was back in a flash with an equally delicious fruity and rich black coffee and, oh a piece of the most glorious dense unctuous orangey, orange blossoming in my roof of my mouth and sticking to my hips, smooth buttery, of course not too sweet but nutty and sophisticatedly chocolatey...oh do excuse me....",

    "text": "I have been a big fan of Ottolenghi's food writing now for quite some time. A Saturday is complete once I have read his latest offering in The Guardian. I also own two of is books and often like to look at them, peeking almost as if I don't want to get caught, lusting after photographs of aubergine, dressed in yogurt sprinkled with pomegranate seeds glistening up from the pages like jewels. This man is the Hugh Hefner of food porn. Everything you want to have and one portion isn't enough. Ottolenghi is a playboy mansion for foodies. His tarts are too obvious to go for. When I went there last week with my beloved we wanted everything. It was a polyamorous feast of the senses. A mezze platter of taste sensation only it was small plate eating. Now I have to break this discourse in what would be somewhat of a food porn fairy tale to mention that small plates still equals big prices. But you know something, once in a while it is nice to feel delightfully ripped off. The food we had was INCREDIBLE like really really incredible. I got off looking at the bread alone which OH MY GOODNESS it was good. His skills as a baker shone. The texture of the foccacia left me wanting more. The olive oil for the bread selection was also wonderful. Peppery yet smooth which allowed the sensual pleasure of the varying textures of the bread to be fully devoured as it seduced the mouth. The 'No Carbs After 6pm' curfew was well worth lifting to eat this bread. OK if you were a coeliac this is the part where you will be yawning away. I don't blame you. For our meal we shared some chargrilled courgette, with pecorino and truffle oil. Everything was offset and balanced against each other in harmony. We also had some Artichoke, Raddichio and faro which was served with lemon and broad beans. Again he triumphed with that one! We then had some scallops that were served on a thick pulse broth, and to top it were some tempura anchovies and some deep fried onion. This was a dish that shone out for me and the scallops were seared so they were meltingly sweet and almost caramel in places. We also had some mackerel that was served with a beetroot and apple salad. This too was nice but I was more into the scallops than anything else. We had a glass of white wine to go with it....unfortunately I forgot the name but it was Italian and \u00a36 a glass and was the only wine priced at that so go figure! To end with My beloved had a chocolate tart thing and I had a tart that was white chocolate, lemon and raspberry. Mine was lighter and the zingy tang of the lemon made the dessert clean tasting on the palate and was rather refreshing. The chocolate tart had a little rum in and was nice but was rather dense. Definitely a dessert for girls who love chocolate. Whilst my beloved licked her lips and transported herself to a chocolate nirvana. I was having a dirty foodie romp with my tart which took me to nearly the realms of a dodgy fantasy. We were both in food utopic voyages that our tastebuds allowed us to have a collective yet individual dining experience. The food was just as beautiful as is presented in the books. It reminded me of The River cafe in many ways. The simple food, bold flavours, simple presentation. But the freshness of the produce, the vibrancy on the plate and the effect on the tastebuds was astronimical. I see the fuss and excitement about Ottolenghi restaurants and yes it was a little bit pricey I definitely want to go back, especially to experience what it is like at breakfast as well as lunch. Next time I need to take a cake somewhere this shall also be one of my main ports of call. It simply has to be done once in a while.",

Puddings are lovely, we've had the passionfruit meringue and the chocolate torte, both very good. The staff are lovely, really knowledgeable and generous - we were able to try the orange wine which we'd never heard of before, and we learnt the difference between organic and biodynamic wine. Both times we've been we were given an individual two-person table rather than the group seating, which is nice though I'm sure the group seating is fine too.

The Islington location has a larger, brighter and more spacious communal seating areas than Knotting Hill.Every food items here is truly unique and true to an idea. The selections vary, there are choices of manny different types of salads and add on mains. But do not be fooled, a salad is not always what you think. The aubergine salad is a meal in itself. And the flavors are rich and varied. You can easily taste many choices with combination of three salads as part of your main.Service is what you would expect in a communal eating experience, fine but not fast. You can always take away food (we prefer after we eat there first).And do not forget to stop buy and grab various cookies and other amazing items (I am looking at you spiced nuts!) on the way out.Recap: go there, go there now.
