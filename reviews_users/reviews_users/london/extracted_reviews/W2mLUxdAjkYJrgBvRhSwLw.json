Make a reservation ahead of time for afternoon tea! We didn't realize you had to do so, but the waitress was kind enough to squeeze us in. However, if we had come in 10 minutes later, there was no way she could have. Very friendly staff. Great time!",

    "text": "I love the decor here! The restaurant is very cute and comfortable, with plush chairs and prettily arranged tea towers It's a great deal for afternoon tea service. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and the pastries were delicious. My favorite were the cupcakes (nutella and carrot cake) and the white chocolate brownie bites. The scones were ok, great with jam and clotted cream but needed some fruit baked into them to really give them flavor. We like a lot of toppings on our scones and had to fight over the small bit of jam they brought for the two of us to share. The sandwiches were good but made on mini baguettes, which was sad because I was hoping for traditional delicate finger sandwiches on thin bread. But they did taste good.My only real issue was that the cutlery could have been a lot cleaner cleaner - this is a big sticking point with me, so \u00a0the fact that they still get 4 stars after this shows you just how great the tea service was overall! Well, that and I wish they'd given us milk or cream for the tea.So, in the end, if you just want tea and a scone, \u00a0they're probably tastier at the Jubilee Cafe at Westminster palace (if you can get there), but this was a full tea service and includes so many great things, I'd definitely recommend it. And come hungry! This tea service is really a full meal, so have it instead of lunch or dinner.",

I went to the One New Change location that is right around the corner from Saint Paul's. Beas is lovely and offers up a huge and delicious afternoon tea for a modest \u00a315. The tea is complete with a cupcake of your choice (you can choose from red velvet, chocolate, tiramisu among others), meringues, brownies, blondies, fresh baked scones with clotted cream and jam, and 3 different types of savory sandwiches. Talk about a bang for your buck. The people were just as charming as the restaurant and have real pride about their products. I love it here and am sad that I have to leave London so soon!",

    "text": "Love love love the newest Bea's. Popped in there for a hot drink on Saturday evening, so there weren't too many cakes and assorted baked goods left. Much to my delight, we got a table right at the corner in the upstairs seating area, which allowed us to people watch. There were quite a few people who just stopped dead in their tracks and came up to the window display to gawk at all the pretty cakes. The decor remains very much in line with the original over at Bloomsbury (duh). I love how the seat cushions bear the same pattern but come in different colours so that they meld in some kind of joyously understated harmony. Did I just write that? Well, it's merely because I really do like their decor. On the food front, the brownie was just as good as at the original shop while the espresso and whiskey bundt cake was delicious if a little too large for just me. I was a little disappointed that my flat white didn't come with any latte art. I know it's not a measure of coffee quality, but I've become accustomed to a little rosetta or heart adorning my coffees!",

    "text": "What do you do when you find yourself in the vicinity of Bank during the weekend and want to relax with a spot of tea? There aren't really that many choices as most shops here are catered for the office crowd and closed during the weekend. Thankfully, Bea's opened their second branch in the no longer new shopping place known as One New Change. Definitely a welcome sight, the place here has more space to accommodate diners than the original. It doesn't have the relaxed intimate atmosphere of its original but still emits a cool urban vibe. We settled to relax and both ordered a cupcake and a drink. I could not help ordering the hot chocolate with a dash of alcohol and since it's the weekend, why not? I've always enjoyed the sweet treats from Bea's and this was no exception. With alcohol and sugary delights in me, I left happily heading to meet up with some friends. If you happen to be looking for a cafe when you're around the area, try popping in here. The price is hiked up slightly compared to the original but comes as no surprise considering the area it is in.",

I wish we'd had time (and appetite) for a dessert because the cakes looked great. This is a great place for a city lunch hour. They're quick, they're friendly, the food is good and the decor is lovely and colourful. Much better than one of the endless pizza chains in the area.",

    "text": "I've been to Bea's twice now. The first time was for a quick lunch a few months ago and the salad I ordered was divine - a lovely combination of yummy savouries. So after a shopping trip in One New Change this week, I brought my friend to Bea's for lunch, insisting it was fantastic. The display of cakes at Bea's is amazing, all sorts of colours and shapes, with brownies, cupcakes and macaroons piled invitingly high. It didn't start well when there was no savoury food (at lunch), wasn't quite sure why but we decided just to have two cakes instead to make up for it! We ordered coffee and I had a brownie and my friend ordered a double chocolate cupcake. My capuccino was more like a latte and I popped some sugar in and stirred and then took a sip. What followed was the most acrid, bitter drink I have ever tasted. My friend had the same experience with her black americano which was completely undrinkable. Her cupcake was dry, with the frosting \"the texture of wet cement, that didn't taste like chocolate\" and my brownie was dry and crumbly and I gave up half way through. There was a mutual agreement NOT to try a second cake. We decided to leave and went to the counter to pay. At no point had we been asked if everything was ok and I presumed the question would be asked at the till, as the table had since been cleared as it was obvious there was a problem with two full coffees just left. No. There were 4 members of staff at the counter and each walked past us a couple of times until after a few minutes, someone decided to serve us. Our payment was taken, we were thanked and that was it!The staff were perfectly nice, but young and very clearly disinterested in helping ensure better customer service. So disappointed. Won't be going back.",

Don't get me wrong, the cream and the jam were indeed tasty (even the decor of the tea parlour was done brilliantly, with lots of lovely sunlight streaming through) however the scone was a massive let down for me.

It's a small location - tea's are had upstairs, but from what I know you can also have cake and tea downstairs if you're looking to just pop in for a nibble.

I was glad as downstairs looked quite cramped. Our server was really bubbly, wishing me happy birthday, and brought us out our sandwiches and tea right away.The sandwiches were good, but I'd made a request saying that one of the parties was vegetarian, so they brought out 3 vegetarian and 3 meat. The meat ones had brie, which I hate! The platter of treats came out like a mirage though, serious sugar overload! There was a cupcake each - a caramel one and one with blueberries on top, marshmallows, meringues, a scone with clotted cream and jam each, and samples of 3 different types of brownie (so yum!). I had the Dragon Green Tea which was lovely, and the tea replenishment was free. I wish you could've had a choice of your main cupcake though!The seating should have been 1 1/2 hours but we cut it down to an hour as had somewhere else to be.It was a bargain for the price, I'd do it again...would you?!",

I decided to treat myself on this miserable Friday and pop over to Bea's for my lunch. The shop is rather small, but in no way cramped. I had a delicious baguette from the selection (although I spend ages eyeing up the array of salad stuffs - I can feel a repeat visit coming on!). It makes a real change from the plastic pre-wrapped sandwiches in my staff canteen! I also had one of the cupcakes - and oh wow! The sponge was delicious (not the lightest I've ever had, but in no way stodgy) and the icing - melt in the mouth amazing! Go on, treat yourself!",

On a quiet Monday afternoon my friend and I enjoyed some dessert with a side of afternoon tea. Seriously skip your lunch because you will want to save room for your mashmallow, meringue, macaron, brownie bite, cupcake and scone. Oh yeah there's some mini baguettes but life's too short to waste stomach space on boring bread.My only wish is that you were able to choose your cupcake. While my friend and I were duly impressed with our vanilla and chocolate option, the lemon and red velvet looked equally amazing. A full afternoon tea will set you back 15 pounds, but it's worth it for a special occasion. I find it's good value for money for a nice afternoon tea as a comparable quality option in central London would run you at least 30 pounds.",

Service is definitely 'surly,' to quote another reviewer. In January, they asked us to leave the table (before we'd quite finished) because they had another table coming in, and then started cleaning up while we were still eating. This time, the person running the register seemed as if he wanted to do ANYTHING but welcome us. Perhaps it was because we dared to ask for high tea without a reservation? The man behind the counter (young man, short blond hair) wordlessly pointed at the sign that says 'reservations recommended.' So...that's a no? And then he ignored us as if that was the end of the interaction. We asked another person behind the counter (a man with what we think was a French accent) if we could get a cream tea, and he helpfully offered to see if they had any scones left. He came back with four scones and placed our order, but it still took 25 minutes to get our food on the table. We saw people who'd ordered after us get all of their food, and we sat there, expectant, hopeful expressions, and waited and waited. Just odd. Yes, the scones were good, but it's London! There are plenty of spots to find decent scones and tea. I won't be back for a third visit at Bea's.",

    "text": "I like Bea's, I like Bea's a lot. Wasn't expecting the 30 minute wait for a seat on a Monday afternoon (I suppose it was tea time, though), but I got through it and had a rather delicious reward at the end.The St. Paul's branch of Bea's, tucked away in an unassuming corner of One New Change shopping centre, is significantly smaller than the other two locations. The sheer lack of table space is probably why my friend and I had to wait, in the first place. They do take reservations \u00a0(although I'm not sure whether only for a full afternoon tea, or also for general dessert and coffee consumption), so maybe I will try to do that next time I get a cupcake craving.The decor of the restaurant is very cute, with tea-related prints on the wall and teapot-shaped lanterns covering each lightbulb that hangs from the ceiling. Adorable, indeed!The real reasons for this review are the following:1) The cupcake and dessert display in the front of the shop made me want to salivate like a Pavlovian dog, and roll around in the desserts not quite like a Pavlovian dog, but maybe another type of dog who likes to roll around in cupcakes and lemon squares. Anyway, they were laid out so beautifully (and bountifully) in the display case, and it took my friend and me the entire 30 minutes we were waiting to decide what we'd get. The cupcake choices were virtually endless: chocolate frosting on vanilla, vanilla frosting on chocolate, vanilla on vanilla, chocolate on chocolate, red velvet, Bailey's frosting on chocolate, raspberry vanilla, peanut butter and jelly, hazelnut chocolate (you're getting really tired of me listing these cupcakes, aren't you? But I'm not at all tired of remembering them). And then there were the cakes proper, cheesecakes, and other dessert bars, the latter of which included a curious-looking peanut butter and jelly bar, lemon squares, and millionaire's squares. There wasn't even a question about getting the red velvet. Sorted. However, we were having major issues with the second thing, because there was so bloody much to choose from. In the end, both being American, and having grown up on peanut butter and jelly (not like the gelatine-based stuff, jam) sandwiches, we thought the peanut butter and jelly bar would be a good choice. 2) The peanut butter and jelly bar was probably the best choice I have made in weeks. With a shortbread crust, layers of peanut butter and strawberry jam, and a streusel crumble topping, the dessert just screamed 'I'm going to make it so that you don't fit into any of \u00a0your clothing, ever again.' As you, proverbially, only live once, I said 'sod it' right back to the little slice of clogged arteries and went right on with it. The red velvet cupcake also did not disappoint, as it was moist, rich, just chocolate enough, and had the perfect frosting-to-cake ratio. I also liked that there was a bit of whipping cream added to the frosting, rather than just cream cheese and butter, as it made the whole thing less dense (but probably not any healthier). Price points are as expected - we paid \u00a311 odd for the two desserts, along with an Americano and a latte. Couldn't do it every day, but for a nice, weekday pick-me-up, Bea's certainly does the trick.",

There aren't really that many choices as most shops here are catered for the office crowd and closed during the weekend. Thankfully, Bea's opened their second branch in the no longer new shopping place known as One New Change. Definitely a welcome sight, the place here has more space to accommodate diners than the original. It doesn't have the relaxed intimate atmosphere of its original but still emits a cool urban vibe. We settled to relax and both ordered a cupcake and a drink. I could not help ordering the hot chocolate with a dash of alcohol and since it's the weekend, why not?I've always enjoyed the sweet treats from Bea's and this was no exception. With alcohol and sugary delights in me, I left happily heading to meet up with some friends. If you happen to be looking for a cafe when you're around the area, try popping in here. The price is hiked up slightly compared to the original but comes as no surprise considering the area it is in.",

We went in March at 3 PM and the sun was blinding and hot and the shades were drawn. Lesson learned. Ha! Service was fabulous and we loved our experience. Each person gets their own tea choice and tea pot. We had green and black currant teas. The black currant was the best tea I have ever had! I am salivating at the thought right now. They kept our pots filled, upon request and lumps of sugar are on the table.The food was very good as well. The scones, in particular, were killer. The sandwiches were all on focaccia bread and consisted of: a fresh moz and caramelized onion, cream cheese and nut mixture and prosciutto and cheese. The bread was just okay but mixtures good. There were blondies, brownies, merengue and two cupcakes(strawberry and chocolate peanut butter). Come on an empty stomach and with good company because you will be there awhile with a large amount of food. Great experience and if we cross the pond again, we would love to go back. Close to St. Paul's, a mall and bus and train lines as well.",

We took ours to go to eat on a bench within good view of the Cathedral. It is our understanding that Beas of Bloomsbury is of repute due to an influence on the Seattle-based mega chain Starbucks.

The red velvet one tasted alright. While I indulged myself for the cupcake, I can't take my eyes off the triple chocolate cake they served near the cashier at reception. I kept thinking of getting it after my cupcake but I was too late when it came to the last piece of cake they have for today. I will return just to have a spoonful of that beauty. The coffee tastes not bad at all. But the best thing they seem to be good at serving is the afternoon tea. I went to the upper floor and the staff told me it was specially booked for high tea only and I caught a brief look at the set of sandwiches, scones and sweet cakes they were serving. It's for \u00a319 per person and they looked busy on a sunday afternoon. I love the inner area of Bea's. Each table is furnished with a cute little bouquet of flower in a mini jam jar.

The cake also looked like it had been through a bumpy car ride, and the sides had scraped off here and there. It's still edible, but for 40 \u00a0quid it should be damn cute. The staff was super sweet, but apparently they don't do writing on cakes at this location. You can take your cake up to their other store for the decorating (no thanks). 4 stars because my coworkers absolutely loved the taste, and it was quite amazing for no pre-ordered. Another plus - you can order with just 24 hours advance (not minimum of 2-3 days I've seen elsewhere (see Hummingbird Bakery)).",

After finally getting our order straight, we were supposed to \u00a0be seated however we had to sit in an undesirable corner on the first floor.

The red velvet was pretty bland and a bit dry. The icing was a good level of sweetness and a good texture. The peanut butter cupcake was much tastier. The chocolate in the cupcake was distinct and the saltiness of the peanut butter frosting was not over whelming. The place was pretty busy and the staff seemed pretty swamped. I wanted to get so much more out of this place because I have been to a number of Bea's events. I suppose I'll just have to come back for a proper afternoon tea or lunch.",

I came on a Wednesday around lunchtime and the line was fairly long but it moved quickly. A man before me snatched up the entire loaf of bread that I wanted a piece of so instead I went with a scone and some hot chocolate. Their scones are a perfect combination of flaky and soft. The jam and clotted cream comes in tiny jars that you can take home afterwards. I probably wouldn't order the hot chocolate again only because it tastes like the stuff you can get at any corner coffee shop. Lovely experience overall.",

Though there are two levels, it is long and narrow and the lay out makes you feel a bit squished. As soon as you walk in, you find yourself at the end of a line. You have to order downstairs. The cup cakes here look very enticing with thick and perfect icing. I opted for a duffin which is a cross between a donut and a muffin. I have to say it was delicious! Bea's is known for its afternoon tea and the prices are quite reasonable, starting from 19 pounds. Most of the seatings are upstairs and at one end of which, you have a view of St Paul's. If you can get a table there, it makes for a great experience. I definitely want to try another location for a proper afternoon tea.",

Anyways, I've mainly taken away and the chai latte has been hit and miss, sometimes, its great, but sometimes, it's a bit cold. So i wasn't too impressed, also i ate in once and they forgot to bring a salad...But, the cupcakes are really yummy, and the frosting, god, its the only frosting I like. it's not stiff, or too sweet, especially the pb & J cupcake, it's so light. Usually I've a substance girl, as in I love cake more frosting, I think decoration is unnecessary but I'd happily have bea's frosting! That is a feat alone!Top tip: if you have a blackhouse card (Grill on the market members) you get 10% off! WIN",

I has a so-so experience at their Holborn location but I was willing to give them another go.And I am so glad I did. The brownie bites, passion fruit flavored marshmallows and cupcakes rocked my socks! The accompanied sandwiches were delicious. They even substituted the tea for coffee and it was a good cuppa.I returned another day and enjoyed a great iced coffee and yummy cupcake. I left in a dream-like state and forgot to pay! I remembered while on the train and with a pink face I returned the next day to pay. They were very appreciative of my honesty and I was, well, very appreciative of them being so understanding.Now I definitely need to come back for lunch soon.

Everyone I raved to went and loved it (LOOK AT TYN R's review). I referred sooooo many people there because I love it so much and was told I can get a free cupcake of choice (which I've yet to collect, but can I say this makes me love them MORE). I must say this ranks as one of my fave places for Afternoon Tea. \u00a0Everything is delicious. I'm not a fan of marshmallows but I could eat a bazillion of theirs. Typing this up I'm pondering when is the next time I can go. Everything I've ever had from Bea's is superbly divine and for the prices they charge, what is there to complain about!!!I love whimsical floating tea pots. When it gets dark and the tea pots are illuminated everything feels so magical. I love the decor as a whole, everything works well together. I've been when they have been quite dead and extremely busy and like any other restaurant you notice the difference in service. But I really wouldn't hold it against them. There are no faults! Actually, my only complaint is not being able to book a table during the weekend if you aren't having afternoon tea. But that just shows how popular they are. NEED MORE BRANCHES OF BEA'S!!!!!",

I made a reservation for gluten-free high-tea on a Thursday afternoon. It wasn't very busy.Menu:Each sandwich had a generous amount of cream cheese that day which I probably shouldn't have eaten since my stomach is sensitive to dairy. I found there were too many sweet items. I couldn't finish all the desserts but I did eat the scone which was warm and delicious. The clotted cream came in a package which was disappointing. I'd come back and maybe ask them leave off the cream cheese. I would also come back with a friend who likes sweet more than savory.Venue:Great atmosphere especially if you are alone, like I was. Central location. Good views of the street from upstairs if you enjoy people watching. Service:The staff was very accommodating and allowed me to replace the avocado sandwich (avocado allergy).

I'm sad to report I just wasn't that impressed. At all. First, this entire shop is in need of a good scrubbing and polish. Despite its fancy digs behind One New Change, the interior somehow seems worn, chipped, a bit grimy and frankly, in need of some polish. Fingerprints on the case, bathroom a bit divey. The good news? This can all be fixed in a few hours, Bea. I highly recommend putting some focus here, it's desperately needed given the price point. Because if I come in to a shop and pay \u00a316 per person for an afternoon tea, I'd expect baseline level of \"very good.\" I'm not expecting a hotel caliber tea experience but I would expect things to be in good order. The one pot of tea was fine, but nothing memorable. The sandwiches seemed liked they'd been sitting a long while (soggy), and the cupcakes were very nice, but the flavors offered to us we didn't pick...so we ended up with something lemon (which I don't like) and something fruity (again, wouldn't have been my first choice). With such a great selection of cupcakes, perhaps let the tea guests select which ones they'd enjoy? The service was nice, although it took an eon to get the check and once we did get it no one ever came back for it so I finally had to just go down and pay for it myself so we could get out of there. Maybe an off day? Perhaps. Oh Bea's, it was our time to shine and unfortunately the dullness of the shop and presentation just left me wanting more.",

    "text": "We decided to go for an alternative Christmas meal at work this year and opted for Beas afternoon tea. The staff made it easy to book and accommodated a few different allergies (nut, gluten and vegetarian).At \u00a329 excluding tip it came to a pricey meal out and didn't include any crackers, Christmas decorations etc however we all came away full, satisfied and most of us with doggy bags of leftover cake! The afternoon tea at \u00a325 includes 3 sandwiches, 3 brownies, a cupcake, a marshmallow, a scone with clotted cream and jam and of course a choice of tea (hot choco or coffee is also an alternative) . For an extra fiver you can upgrade to 'gold afternoon tea' which adds a macaroon and a mini bottle of fizz (worth it in my opinion). Sandwiches were really good - highlights being the cream cheese & walnut. There was also one with mozzarella in and one with salami but I think they mix this up q fair bit. The bread that they used was a nice salty focaccia which made it different to the normal finger sandwiches you get. On to the scone - most of them looked good but mine was a little dry and over baked, however there was plenty of jam and clotted cream to slather on top and with tea and fizz to wash it down it was more than bearable. There was a lotta sweet stuff - the brownies were lovely and rich however the blondie was disappointing; just sugar with no white chocolate. The marshmallows were homemade and obviously super sweet but not my thing. These came in different flavours but I got a plain one so it was a bit boring. For the main event: each cake stand had several cupcakes of different flavours. I had a lovely chocolate and pistachio one which was moist and rich. The only odd thing was the cream on top which had a funny texture. It was also a shame you couldn't choose the cupcake you wanted from the menu. Finally - I went for the black vanilla tea which was delicious. Not too sweet but didn't need milk. It went perfectly with the cakes. However don't expect too much choice. I think there were only 8 teas available. Overall a lovely team outing (we were nearly there for 2 hours although service was efficient). I will be back for a cup of tea and cake but not for afternoon tea - I've had better in London I'm afraid!",

This place is cute, not very big, highly recommended getting reservation. \u00a0The entrance has sweets and treat for take away, if you don't want to have the full experience. \u00a0There was three of us, we recieved an assortment of sandwiches, (tuna, pulled pork, smoked cheese) scones was delightful with yummy cream and jam ( this was the highlight of the afternoon) and assortments of sweets from marshmallows, brownies, cupcakes. \u00a0 Everything was ok, nothing extraordinary. \u00a0As mentioned before the scone cream and jam was delouse, I would come back for those. \u00a0We all choose a creamy earl grey which was good. \u00a0Overall, it was a good experince.",

We were excited to go somewhere that we could dress in a casual manner since we were out sightseeing. This did not mean we were not willing to pay for a nice high tea. Once we were seated we observed dirty glasses dirty cups no napkins and we were not even given a fork during the entire time of our visit. The food and service were mediocre at best. Overpriced for what we received. If you want high tea go back to your hotel and get dressed up and simply go somewhere fancy. This establishment is not recommended.",

So we decided to go back to Bea's but thought it would be nice to sit down and have a drink, hence why we ended at Bea's of Bloomsbury. It was about 2pm and we were ready to order the infamous duffin, but to our disappointment they had no nutella ones left! I settled on the jam one and whilst it was ok the hot chocolate wasn't great, too rich and the service could have been better. It seems the team is young and inexperienced so the service felt a bit chaotic. They are however friendly and this isn't the staff's fault if perhaps they need a tad more training.",

    "text": "I came here for afternoon tea with a group of four, after some friends recommended it. The location is near St. Paul's but it was a little odd that it was part of an outdoor mall. The tea house was cute on the inside and narrow with an upstairs section where we were seated. If you're looking to have a proper or traditional afternoon tea, don't come here. It is a more casual or cafe style take on afternoon tea. That being said, the sandwiches were delicious and were served on a thick focaccia type of bread. The scone was amazing too and I loved their clotted cream! I don't have any complaints with the tea (English breakfast) either except our waitress was never around to ask for more hot water. The desserts were what I was most disappointed in. They served us an array of cupcakes, brownies, and meringues, which were all equally unimpressive. At 20 something \u00a3s, I did not find the experience quite worth it. Although, it is a much cheaper alternative to afternoon tea in London if you desire something more casual and filling. Just don't come here expecting a formal tea experience.",
