The pub has plants and has an old pub feel to it, even though its quite modern. You can see a nice view of London. Even though i lost my phone in the river next to the pub, its still a great place. It attracts alot of tourists because of its great service. I recommend this pub.",

But, despite being pricey, it's still an absolutely lovely place to sit and while away a \"british summer\" afternoon with friends. The burger was surprisingly really good AND they had Blue Moon on tap. Works for me.",

    "text": "#1 on the London Bridge to Tower Bridge Ale Trail, The Old Thameside Inn is located of course alongside the Thames and Sir Frances Drakes Pirate Ship! That said, the amazing outdoor seating is dampened by the smell...of the really cool old boat (can't be helped sigh) and the Thames itself, but that's not a surprise. Once you've carefully used the old, scary steepish stairway from the Bridge, walk down the street and around the corner you will find this large, comfortable place to drink, but not eat. To be honest I know better than to eat at any of the Nicholson pubs. As stated in The Cambridge review, I met my BF when he was working at one, thus giving me the details about the food service that I rather not know. Only exception to the rule for the both of us is De Hems, check my profile for that one. What I love about the Old Thameside Inn is the seating atmosphere provided. It's gorgeous inside and out. Kind of dungeon-y with iron castings and old school spiral stairway, there is always going to be plenty of space to enjoy yourself as long as you get there at the right time. Like the nearby Mudlark they too serve a green type of beer. It looks like it's from the river itself. Awesome. While actually doing the ale trail, my mates BF and our other male friend received t shirts and stamps while we were there. We were only on our third pub! My friend and myself were so jealous that they were given extras while we were ignored, but also enjoyed the fact that the bartender was kind enough to reverse the stereotype. When it grew too chilly to stay outside we went downstairs and sat feeling posh amongst the dim lighting on the leather seats. It's a strange pub that appears to be super old but swanky at the same time. It succeeded in providing us with a wonderful atmosphere to have a pint. In reading the other reviews I'd agree with them although I haven't tasted the food so I can't really say. This place is great for groups, bad I guess for eating, no wheelchair access and the bathrooms were fabulous. Take what you will from the reviews, but if anything just go a pint, that's all pub should really do for us anyway.",

It is quite a large pub with traditional decoration; carpet, brass fittings etc. Perhaps the main selling point of the pub is its position next to the Golden Hind, a reconstruction of Sir Francis Drake's ship. They have the normal range of drinks and food as well. I have not ordered food here but the service at the bar can be a little slow. I have visited the pub a few times; twice as a stop on a pub crawl and there is little to recommend it for much else.",

They fame themselves on their bar food so I went here with my parents recently to check it out. We were pretty disappointed by the whole thing. We had left an hour to get lunch before seeing a play nearby. We ended up being really stuck for time because the lunch tool over half an hour to come out, despite us asking the waiters a few times to see if it was ready.The food was fine, I just had chips and my mum had soup. Dad went for the daily special which was bangers and mash. The sausages were lovely but the mashed potato was in fact instant mash, or smash as its better known! I find that really unacceptable to charge \u00a37 for some instant mash that tasted nothing like the real thing. If you're looking for food or are in any rush at all I wouldn't go here. I could imagine though that it's really nice in the summer because they have a huge terrace along the river front which would be great for a drink in the sunshine.",

With limited data coverage on our cell phone plans, we didn't have a lot of wiggle room to look up reviews so decided on the Old Thameside Inn for lunch based solely on the location and ended having an absolutely delicious lunch! It's a bit interesting how this restaurant works. First, you'll want to choose a table as they each have a number and you'll need that to order. Despite it being a crowded Sunday afternoon, we were fortunate enough to land a patio table overlooking the Thames River, which is exactly why we chose the place to begin with! Second, you'll choose what you want to eat and drink and send someone from your party to order while the other guards your seat. England is of course known for their fish n' chips so we both opted for this meal. To drink, I went with a cider and my boyfriend a beer. Third, the person who is to order will go inside and place the order at the bar. The bartender will ask what table number to associate with the order. Lastly, the host will bring out your food when it's ready and all you have left to do is savor and enjoy!I had many a fish n' chips throughout the duration of my trip to London and the Old Thameside Inn's version was by far the best. The fish was extremely fresh tasting and the batter was nice and flaky. The main host was extremely friendly and was even courteous enough to take our photo.",

    "text": "I decided to have my birthday drinks here as its a nice pub, the Southbank is one of my favourite places in London and there's a nice selection of drinks available. The overall experience was good. We were allowed to sit in the dining area and order our food and drinks which included table service which was handy (but obviously meant that we had to pay an service charge). I opted for the chicken and leek pie which came with mash and seasonal greens. The meal was pretty decent. Good pub grub! The mash was creamy and buttery and the pie was tasty but not too filling which enabled me to finish the lot! We then ordered pudding which was a trio of desserts and I shared it with one of my friends. The dessert stated that it came with a warm chocolate brownie, brandy snap Eton mess and rose sugar glazed lemon tart. However when it arrived, the Eton mess had been replaced by profiteroles. We were not given any warning when ordering or any apology when it was served which was really annoying. We also had to wait a ridiculously long time for the desserts - nearly an hour and some of us just wanted to go home. Furthermore, as it was birthday dinner and drinks, people were coming and going. The waitress told us there were too many of us at the table so we said fine, where can we go, however she did not offer an alternative. For somewhere that offers table service and charges service, I thought that that was rude. The food and drink is the saving grace of this place (I forgot to mention I had a tasty rhubarb gin and tonic), the service was pants.",

It has a nice cosy feel.However, once again, The old Thameside is at it's most popular in the summer because of it's riverside location. There is ample space to sit or stand outside to take in the views. St Pauls cathedral is again the central focus.",

We were a large group who were eating and drinking sporadically. We had a table in the restaurant area but did have more people gradually joining our party. At one point the staff told our newest member that they couldn't sit down as they were in the way, but didn't try at all to solve the problem or help us relocate to a larger area. We ordered quite a lot of food yet they just seemed desperate for us to leave. Gratuity was automatically added and we felt obliged to pay it, but honestly wouldn't have if it wasn't. The food was pretty nice so that's it's only saving grace. Mac and cheese was particularly ace as were the pies. Really good British pub food. It did however take so long to come (we waited over 20minutes for cups of tea alone). Not planning on making another trip.",

Friendly, lots of options, happy to ply you with drinks in exchange for your tourist money.I didn't have any food, generally sticking away from pub fare, but I imagine from what I saw go by our table, that it's pretty good.
