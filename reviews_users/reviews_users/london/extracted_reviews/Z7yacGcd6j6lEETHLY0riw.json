We were seated immediately but it took quite some time for the waiter to take our order. We decided to order from the set lunch menu and sea urchin and pork dumplings. After about a 30 minute wait for our food, it finally came out. Being from New York, I'm always a little hesitant to try Chinese food in other cities but all in all it was very good. Sweet and sour pork was very tasty along with our beef with peppers. Only complaint would be the service at the establishment. Once our food arrived, we never saw our waiter again. \u00a0No one to ask if we would like any more water or additional drinks. I would have been more upset but the food made up for this. Would definitely come back here again when passing through.",

Perhaps we would have enjoyed everything more had it been a bit hotter. The pancakes served with the duck weren't even luke warm but cold with the main courses arriving on plastic plates - what happened to the old-fashioned tradition of hot plates?I am also not a big fan of MSG and all dishes were heavily reliant on this additive.

Pretty average dim sum in my opinion. Nothing really stood out. Not elegant, no unique taste.Taste BreakownHar Gow: it was ok. just your typical taste, typical sizeSiu Mai: there was a piece of shrimp on the top. feels a bit like the taste of har gow more than the typical siu mai which is more of a pork taste.Siu Long Bao: no juice inside. did not even make my mouth water (not hard to do when I'm hungry).I thought the price was ok since I have had more expensive ones and also cheaper ones but maybe in London, this is cheap.

It is my default recommendation for anyone looking for dim sum because the quality is consistent and well above average, plus the location is central. I know Chinatown restaurants seem to get a bad rep, but I go by my taste buds.The dim sum menu is really friendly, with pictures so you can point if you're a newbie. The service is \"Chinatown standard\", brusque and efficient, sometimes a bit hard to get someone's attention, but only a little rude. They only have one kind of tea, unfortunately.Must-gets: baked pork puff, taro croquettes, prawn and chive dumplings, egg tarts for dessert. Their specialty is sesame balls, which are sweet, and I haven't quite figured out when to order them because they take some time to prepare (unless they're sold out). The time is variable: 15 minutes to an hour(!). Sometimes I order them with everything else, and then they come before we're ready. Sometimes I order as we're finishing, but then the wait is too long. It's a mystery. But totally worth it.Fine: cheung fun, steamed pork bun, beancurd prawn rolls, Chinese greens (hard to mess up). I once tried the crispy seafood noodles, which were a little disappointing.They don't take reservations for Sunday dim sum, so just show up at noon. By the time we leave, there's always a queue out the door. Last time was just under \u00a313pp with 7 people, including tea and service charge.",

It was like a war of chopticks and forks when everybody dived into their food. The roast duck with steamed buns took longer to arrive and by then, we'd already placed an extra order of fried rice, because, Asians LOVE their rice! the boys each had a bottle of Tiger beer to round out the greasiness of our food. I stuck with good old black tea.Decor is typical Chinese resto with wooden accents and year round Christmas tree lights. The tablecloths were tattered looking but the plates are clean. Service was so-so and we had to flag our waiter down for our bill which was 100 quid with tips.

    "text": "We found this place in Chinatown. The food was okay. It wasn't bad but not a standout. The shrimp chow mein had all of 7 shrimps in it. A bit chintzy. They charged us about 3.5 British pounds- that's over 4 US dollars-for a small bowl of white rice! \u00a0The worst part of our experience was that we had 2 grand-babies with us. While the 3 y.o. quietly ate her small bowl of plain white rice, the 2 y.o. was getting restless so we let him play with the small salt shaker where he put salt into a bowl, so he doesn't throw a tantrum or food around. The short man, whom I found out was the owner, marched over to our table in anger and scolded us for wasting his salt. He looked visibly angry. We spent 37 BPs ($48) for the light lunch, so I am sure we more than paid for the 5 cents worth of salt my grand-baby wasted. \u00a0As we were leaving, he lectured us about controlling the children. What a piece of work. He was plain mean and stingy.",

Over one pound of perfectly prepared pork. \u00a0Great balance of sauce and sear, succulent pieces all. \u00a0This was 5 stars all day and worth the vinegar, err, \"wine\" I was forced to pair with it. \u00a0Now they had other wine choices, but I wasn't about to tempt fate for 25-30 pounds per glass. \u00a0If i ouwld have skipped the toast and had a better glass of wine, this was 4-4.5 stars all day. Wait time was 15 minutes. \u00a0Atmosphere was...well, \u00a0a classic London Chinese place I suppose!Would certainly come back for the pork!",

We got seated almost right away and the food is typical Chinese food--maybe a notch higher than Panda Express--which is probably the only thing decent about this place, because the service is terrible. It took like half an hour for two dishes of our order to come out--and the place is crowded, so you'd think they'd try to clear the place out--and we had to wait maybe fifteen to twenty minutes more for our last dish, which was chow mein. Furthermore, in order to get our last plate to come out, we tried to flag a waiter down several times, only to be either ignored or unseen. One of the members of my party had to get up and talk to one of them in order to get them to bring the last dish out. Our water glasses were unfilled, nobody came over to ask if everything was okay, and the portions were fairly small. I might just be going on a rampage right now, but this restaurant was average at best. If I ever come back to London, I'm not coming back here.",

Normally, when I have cravings for Chinese I find myself there.I like the large hall on the ground floor.Definitely don't expect anything spectacular but food is nice, nothing special, but Chinese food well made.I would recommend the squid in black bean sauce and recommend against pork belly. The latter was stiff and not juicy at all. Whereas squid was tender and not at least rubbery.Shame they don't have any side salads, but you can order broccoli with garlic sauce which is nice too.The place is good for groups - they have large tables that can accommodate up to 8 people at a time.Service is good: they would explain the difference between the sauces & dishes and drop an occasional joke.",

This seem to the busiest out of all the restaurant and it looked good judging from the menu. We went in and were seated immediately. We ordered the fixed menu since we weren't sure what to get and an order of dumplings. The service was a bit slow but the food was great. Everything tasted fresh and not too salty like some other Chinese restaurants make their food. I had an enjoyable experience there and would probably go back if I'm back in London.",

I particularly like the siu mai, duck tongue and chicken feet (my favorite), and the nai wong bao was quality. Their beef chow fun was also probably the most authentic I've had in London so far.The funny thing with Chinese food is that everyone has different standards and tastes. I am from Portland, Oregon, USA, which is not necessarily renowned for Chinese restaurants, but actually has some great ones IF you know where to go. I consider myself a bit of a snob when it come to Chinese food, but this place was great.",

    "text": "I came here with a couple friends on a Tuesday evening (around 6 pm) and the place was already fairly packed. The wait wasn't too bad though - no more than 10 minutes. For food we went for three dishes - sauteed prawns with vegetables, monk vegetable dish, and honey barbecue pork (I don't remember the exact names) - and three orders of white rice. After we ordered, the lady taking our order indicated that she thought three dishes wouldn't be enough for us - this was fine, but what bothered me was how when we said we would order more later if that turned out to be the case, she said that if we did that we would have to wait 20 minutes for the next round of food...I also didn't appreciate how when we got three orders of rice (for four people) and I asked how big the rice portions were, she said they were \"very small\" and \"only for one person.\" Both of her claims turned out to be wrong, however, as the three dishes were perfect for feeding four people, and the rice portions were HUGE.Anyway, I was very satisfied with the food. My favorite dish was the prawns, which I thought was very light but well-flavored. I also liked the monk vegetable dish, which came with stir-fried tofu, mushrooms, and other greens. The honey barbecue pork though...I wasn't a fan - it was very difficult to chew and was too heavy on the sauce, in my opinion.Overall, I enjoyed my meal here (despite the service in the beginning) and the food definitely satisfied my craving for Chinese food. I've been to a couple other Chinese restaurants in the area, and this place has definitely been my favorite so far in terms of both food and service (overall).",

It didn't take long before we were seated, at first we were told to go upstairs, but the lady saw we had luggage and didn't wanted to hand them in the \"wardrobe\" so she found another spacious table for us close to the door. We ordered a couple of things and got our chinese tea pretty quickly. 1 teapot were charged for 5 people and I see the same teapot everywhere it doesn't even depend on how many people were drinking from that. Our orders arrived pretty fast and before we thought about taking picture of our first dish, it disappeared quickly since we were so hungry! It looked delicious but I miss a bit taste to it, the others at the table agreed it was the fried beef ricenoodles. Then our fung chao arrived, there was nothing to complain about it. The charsiu buns were also fine! We also ordered 1/2 duck, it was perfect but a little bit raw since the meat was a bit too rosy. We also ordered charsiu cheong fun and it was smooth and delicious! Last but not least, we know that in London there's always a discretionairy charge so we were fine with it, but the waiter never came back with our change, at least if he was expecting tips, he should have come back with our money first, BEFORE TAKING WITHOUT ASKING. HOW RUDE! This is why it's a 2-star worth because of the service (VERY IMPORTANT!) and the expensive chinese tea.",

First of all, the dim sum menu (like most Yelpers said) is super friendly - with pictures for each menu item served so you know exactly what you are getting. I'm Chinese but my Chinese is shabby so I always somehow manage to order a wrong dish when faced with a menu with no pictures and just text (even when it's translated into English). The wait was under ten minutes for two people at 2:00pm on a busy Saturday. We got: shrimp/chive dumplings (good), bbq pork triangular pastries (a must get, there's a reason this menu item takes up one FULL page of their dim sum menu - it is definitely one of the hottest centrefolds I have ever seen), chicken feet w/ black bean sauce (really good), scallop cheung fun (pass, I have had better), fried shrimp dumplings with salad cream (pass, I have had way better), beef chow fun (good), taro croquettes (good), duck tongue (good, if you are into that stuff--my date was), and steamed spare ribs w/ black bean sauce (portions are too small but they are good). As for the spotty service, we didn't experience any. You get different servers who bring you what you have ordered and some of them are smiling, some of them are not - but who cares? I feel like people who leave bad reviews just because not every server smiled at them when they put the food down is just looking to get their egos stroked. The food is piping hot, fresh and delicious. When you ask for water, it comes fast and when you want an extra plate of chili oil, it comes right away. Tea pot out of hot water? Flip the top up and put it on the edge of your table - it is a Chinese standard way of telling the servers you are in need of a tea refill. Tea is \u00a31.50 pp but it has unlimited refills, and the refills come fast, which is surprising since my date and I \u00a0were seated in a dark corner - we thought they would forget about us, but that was far from the truth. I'm a generous tipper but don't like to be ambushed with the mandatory 12.5% service charge when handed the bill. This was the first dim sum place in Chinatown to have that mandatory 12.5% - so I took one star away. Other than that, I recommend this place and would take my parents here if they ever come visit me in London!",

It did not take long for us to be served nor did it take long for the food to arrive either.. But that was the problem, fried squid was too salty and soggy, not at all crispy. Portions were not as impressive as some of the photo reviews i've seen either - maybe because it was a Friday night, who knows.Upon receiving the bill i asked about their discretionary service charge - waitress was quick to defend and in her words \"you sat down, we served you..\" Quite forceful like I had no choice but to pay it.Whatever, I was going to pay it anyway i was only asking. Needles to say, she did not come back to process my payment and had to call over another waiter.",

My mouth just kept flashing DUCK, MM, DUCK into my brain, which was more than okay.Then the waves of steamed dumplings started washing over us all, and there were serene moments of the eight of us just chewing and sighing at how good it was. Big fan of their Shanghai soup dumplings actually, and the boiling soup didn't have that MSG tang when it hits the back of your throat.Other highlights were their aubergine clay pot (get some white rice to soak up all juices, folks), the sticky rice packets, and the spicy chicken feet.Staff was rather friendly! We had an OBSCENE amount of decadent food, and it came out to \u00a317 a person.Come check it out on a Sunday afternoon with your eating dress on, and then go curl up somewhere for naptime before the dim sum sweats start.",

    "text": "Golden Dragon is the go to place for dim sum ever since I moved to London. Their dim sum and the Cantonese style dishes are pretty good generally.It's interesting to see some people gave low ratings merely because of misunderstanding (culture wise). For example, they don't serve dim sum for dinner. I can confirmed that 99% of Chinese (dim sum) restaurants in the Far East don't serve dim sum for dinner. I never had dim sum for dinner in my life. Maybe the odd ones in China Town still serve it for western customers. Another person was complaining the waiter told them to stop their toddler from playing with cutlery and toothpicks. I also saw a waiter telling customers not to play with cutlery in one occasion. Maybe they don't know playing with cutlery is extremely rude in Chinese culture. Please bare in mind. Especially if you're Chinese, you should know better, and letting kids playing cutlery can be dangerous! It's also really funny, a person gave a low rating because they ordered too much food and complaint the waiter didn't warn them beforehand? Seriously? Some people are expecting life help!I do agree services can be a hit and miss. And I have to admit that one or two staff aren't my favourite. But a lot of them are very helpful and friendly. They made customers to round up the total (because they don't like pennies?) and when I asked them why, I just got the generic BS answer, rather than being honest to the customers. \u00a0Anyway, I believe rude services can due to cultural differences and the use of English language.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I luckily stumbled upon London's Chinadown while taking a stroll around Piccadilly Circus. Although there were plenty of restaurants to choose from, we rolled the dice on Golden Dragon after seeing their decent Yelp reviews. It was no surprise that about 95% of the customers were non-Asian and, from the looks of it, were probably tourists, but don't let that deter you from thinking the food was not legit. Once we got inside and were seated, we actually could have easily mistaken the restaurant for any Chinese restaurant we had been to back home in New York. In addition, we were greeted by employees that spoke to us in Cantonese, and in a way it made us feel like we were home. As for the menu and food, the menu selection was huge and very detailed. Every legit food that we could get back home was on the menu for all to see. All of it in Chinese and English. The only gripe we had about the menu ... the prices! Everything was much more expensive here.After mulling over the menu, we decided on the Crispy Sucking Pig, Orange Duck and Tofu with green vegetables. When the dishes came out there was an obvious observation and that was that the dishes were kind of small for family style type food. The flavors were OK, but nothing like we hadn't had before. However, it wasn't a bad thing either because we now knew that London had a Cantonese food scene that we didn't realize existed prior.Bottom line: The restaurant was huge (with 2 floors), the employees were fairly nice and spoke good English, the menu was legitimately true to Cantonese style food and the flavors were average compared to what we had experienced back home.",

Hong Kong tends to serve the skin and aerate it so it's crispy and light.

I'm making a mental note to try their Dim Sum in the new year!In terms of service, I felt that it could be better. Like any Chinatown restaurant, I find that they're a bit pushy.

There's definitely a reason people queue up to eat here.We didn't try their regular menu, but I'd highly recommend their dim sum, especially for larger parties!",

That is generally a good sign of a restaurant's authenticity. If you wander out into the West Midlands or worse, Essex... You'll be hard pressed to find a Chinese restaurant of this calibre.The red barbecue pork buns (Cha Siu Bao) are fluffy and flavourful. Do NOT give into the temptation to dip those perfect white buns into the soy! It ruins the balance of the flavour and the pork is already a bit salty. I also enjoyed the chicken feet. As strange as they may look, they're delicious. They're steamed in some soy sauce vinegar broth, reminiscent of Filipino Adobo. Bloody Hell, I could mong out on those feet for ages; and the best part: you can pick your teeth with the little claws.Now, for the bad part. For traditional Hong Kong dim sum, this place is rather spendy. You can easily shell out 35 quid a person, especially if you accompany your meal with a Tsingtao lager. A similar feast in the States would cost you just about half, but don't think about that. You're an ocean away from New York, and in Jolly England, this is as good as it gets. Eat, drink and be merry!",

Guests are asked to leave their name and number of guests and are then called out. I have never waited longer than 15 min. They have an excellent dim sum during the day but not in the evening. The quality of the food is excellent and decent value for money. If you do not like the hustle and bustle downstairs ask to be seated upstairs. A word of advise: This is an extremely busy restaurant so sometimes it can be a challenge to get the attention of the waiters. Some of them can be quite rude. The breakdown of the bill is written in Mandarin, so try to keep track of what you ordered. Service charge is included in the bill, do not let them charge you twice. Verdict: Good quality food for decent prices in a very touristic area. Good for large groups, but don't expect a zen moment in this busy place.",

They have two large floors that are constantly busy with people, so much so that it's sometimes hard to get a waiter's or waitress' attention. There are so many tables on the floor that they can quickly accommodate especially large groups, something many other Chinese restaurants in the area struggle to do. All of the dim sum dishes are always consistently good, and if anything I highly recommend people try the black sesame dumplings for dessert. It's a little bit of an acquired taste, but when you bite into those warm, white dumplings to intercept the tasty black liquid that fills it, there's just nothing like it. One word of warning is that sometimes they ask if you want to put extra service on your card, when it's already been included in the bill. Sometimes it pays to double check the items you order as you end up having to decipher Chinese characters to validate your bill.",

Dishes are moderately priced and you certainly won't be doing your taste buds a disservice. Must-tries include the prawn rice noodle rolls, lotus leaf-wrapped glutinous rice and their mini egg-custards (a sweet alternative to the British nutmeg-laced treats). Be aware however that the staff have a tendency to impose a minimum dish order not levied against linguistically able compatriots. Still, the main menu has much to offer also, and will appear much less daunting if accompanied by an aficionado of Cantonese cuisine. As with most high quality Chinese restaurants, sharing is the key to a rounded meal, particularly given the generous portions afforded for main dishes here. The ambiance encapsulates the fervent collective, both large dining areas ornate and joyous in their decoration, typical of the nation's favoured depiction of prosperity. The service is efficient without being overly boisterous, but do note that as much as they would like you to believe otherwise, the bill summary does include a standard service charge (you can always check the total against the detailed list, albeit written in Chinese). The highest accolade I can bestow upon this restaurant is the simple fact that the three generations of my girlfriend's family (originally from Hong Kong, and including a retired chef), have selected this as their Central London point of convergence. Evidence enough to give the place a chance? Well you know my answer to that",
