This is its strength each dish is rich and deeper than an original the quality 90%of the time is great. I especially love the Penne Arrabiata simple yet packed with more garlic than is decent. Pizza fantastic but still pizza Euforia at Wimbledon Chase the best I had in London this a close 2nd. Service now far too loud on Saturday to be relaxed. Prefer it when the waiters just tried to Dance now loud music plays all night on sat I just go on the week or sin afternoon. Still really tasty food and good value. Also do take away.",

Despite being a large group, everything came out without a large wait for any, which many could be forgiven for expecting from such a large order in a busy establishment. Speaking of large orders, beware of food sizes. The large pizza option is for those who feel they can eat close to their own body weight. I just about did, but couldn't squeeze in one of the lovely looking desserts. If you fancy somewhere un-chain-restaurant-like, go here.

The waiter was as italian as the chianti bottles decorating the ceiling, took our order fairly quickly. I asked for a small pizza and thought he had not heard because I got one the size of a large dinner plate but then I saw a large pizza arriving at a nearby table on a wooden board the size of my coffee table! I had the 'pescatori', decorated with prawns, mussels and baby squid. A perfect thin and light crispy base (very authentic) and it was very tasty, though I struggled to finish it. I chose a rocket salad to accompany it, which was nice and fresh, with a tangy dressing and parmesan shavings. My companions had a generous tuna steak and a large plate of calamari, which they said were very good. A good coffee to finish was all we could manage, so I can't comment on the deserts.

It was busy and noisy and every bit as atmospheric as an Italian restaurant should be, but in that way that makes you feel like you are still enjoying an intimate dinner with the other people at your table. It's like the babble creates a bubble.The food was delicious, I ordered a tagliatelle with prawns and avocado, covered in a creamy tomato sauce and it was excellent. I've had the penne arrabiata on another visit, so simple and so perfect.They also do their pizzas by the metre, which is my plan for next time - can I eat a metre of pizza? Well we'll soon see.",

The menu is very affordable and the food is great. They have a fantastic range of pizzas, pastas, fish dishes , grills and veggie options.Being a bit of a cheese freak the Quattro Fromagi was delicious for me and for 14 pounds i got a 'medium' pizza but for me this was more like a large. The large pizzas are massive!The staff are great, really friendly and easy to have a laugh with, the atmosphere on a busy evening is great and for all of these reasons i highly recommend a visit to Al Fornos.",

    "text": "Al Forno's is Wimbledon's bonafide Italian restaurant. Set over a two level shop front just left of Wimbledon Broadway, Al Forno's offers the discerning eater a range of pizzas, pastas, seafood and grill options all cooked in authentic Italian style. My favourite part is ordering from a real Italian waiter, all of who know Italian food very well, and have probably spent many a day fending off their grandmother's requests to feed them.You must request the four in one option of Al Forno's pizza range: this pizza is absolutely huge and cooked to perfection. I would go as far as to say that their four-in-one pizza is one of the best I've tasted. Margarita and pepperoni, meat, chicken and Italian sausage were our choices, and for \u00a315, the effects of four full satisfied stomachs were quite apparent thereafter. Our waiter even got a complimentary shooter as thanks for his tip.",

Except for the extra spicy chilli's billed as peppers. Couldn't tell you what else was on the menu but judging by the busy crowd in here I'm sure it's more then super-sized pizzas getting the punters in.Apparently the red wine was foul, according to Dave the wine critic, all in all a great night. Roll on Mojitos and jumping up and down, which we'll call dancing.",

I really love their Italian dressing and garlic bread.I have a feeling I'll be coming here a lot since a friend just moved basically right next door to the restaurant.",
