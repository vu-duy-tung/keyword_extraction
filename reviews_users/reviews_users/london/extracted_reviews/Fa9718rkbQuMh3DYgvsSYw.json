    "text": "The double stack of fried vegetable-mash patty I got in a burger bun along with two little corn bread muffins presented an amazing value at \u00a35.95, but the only thing that made me eat it with relish was the BBQ sauce (both sweet and spicy) I smothered it in before eating the patties alone with a fork and knife. \u00a0Sans the BBQ sauce, it would have just been a bog-standard vegetarian burger from a completely forgettable London eatery. \u00a0To prove that my rating isn't just a vegetarian bias, Robert D got a combo plate with a quarter of a chicken, a rack of ribs, and pulled pork. \u00a0He said the only thing really notable about the plate full of food was the pork, as the chicken was just, well, chicken, and the ribs were overcooked. \u00a0The cornbread only tasted like the real deal when a slab of butter was placed in the middle of it and allowed to melt. \u00a0Mmmm... cornbread.The people at the table next to us got rib platters, and theirs looked different to the overcooked ones on our table. \u00a0They also got them with heart-attack-inducing chilli cheese fries. \u00a0Those looked intense.The downstairs restaurant was cozy, albeit confusing. \u00a0The antelope antler wall lights, the tartan carpets, the wood-panelled walls... the decor screamed more North American mountain lodge than it did deep south BBQ joint. \u00a0The service was a bit slow, but the friendliness made up for it.Overall, Bodean's was, well, probably the best BBQ you'll find in London because it has absolutely 0 competition, but by true American standards, it was wholly disappointing. \u00a0So I'm meeting in the middle at 3 stars. \u00a0I would only return if I had a hankering to obliterate my main course completely to the point of rendering it unidentifiable by smothering it in some sweet, hot, delicious BBQ sauce. \u00a0Which I'm sometimes wont to do.",

Ordered a half portion of back back ribs, with fries and coleslaw and it was just wonderful. We all sat there in content silence after, just digesting. The others ordered burgers, which they proclaimed were equally if not more delectable. And the fries, were crunchy with substance.Service was a little slow at times, but understandably as it was Friday lunchtime and the poor staff were rushed off their feet. Plus, we paid with five cards and the lovely waitress patiently processed the order, card by card. We were sitting downstairs, so it was nice and cosy but my friend who has been here and sat upstairs, says they are more prompt there, as downstairs is for people who have more time and require table service.Really nice place, good food. Bring a big appetite, as you are guaranteed to be stuffed...",

Having seen Bodeans on the numerous occasions on my way to Cattle Grid, I knew it was a safe choice as it is always packed with people. Conveniently I had an American friend in tow and we found it ironic that I would take her to an American style restaurant on her first visit to London. If you like meat, especially eating lots of it with your hands, this is the place for you. There was a 1.5 hr wait for a table downstairs so we waited up top for about ten minutes before we spotted a table leaving. Perfect ... the menu was simple. There were different portion sizes and combinations so you could easily get what you want. I had a full slab of beef back ribs and they did not disappoint (\u00a314.95). The fries were perfection. Even my American friend was impressed with the food and the American football highlights on show. I'd recommend Bodeans for a casual night out. Quick service, no fuss and affordable prices in Soho.",

I can honestly say it is the best burger I've had for months. Now I don't have that manybut I probably would if they all tasted like this. The chips that come with it are fairly average, but they would be playing second fiddle whatever. There is an upstairs area that looks like a diner. I prefer the downstairs restaurant section.

    "text": "Greedy Diva @ greedydiva.blogspot.com  If it's big meaty portions of chin wiping, greasy fingers glory you're after, Bodean's is not a bad option. It's probably not Texas, but it might be the most convenient way to imagine you're chowing through a good ol' Texan BBQ in the heart of London. We've been a number of times now, always at the desperate behest of The Peanut Gallery, when he needs his fill of American, cowboy hat wearing, testosterone filled, beer swilling, gut thumping stuff. Or when he wants to watch the football on the big screens. On the ground floor is the casual deli/diner. Downstairs is a dark restaurant which looks like a sports bar. I prefer the ground floor bit. I always go for one of the gigantic hot deli sandwiches (in hamburger buns) \u00a0usually the Pulled Pork as pictured (\u00a35.25) with mounds of juicy pulled pork piled on a toasted bun, topped with BBQ sauce. There are also sandwiches with pastrami, burnt ends, brisket, coleslaw, slow cooked pork shoulder, or combinations of the above. The fries are good too. The Peanut Gallery recently tried the beef hot dog (\u00a34.95) \u00a0just like any junky-in-a-good-way hot dog to me, although he (being more of a hot dog man) seemed pretty happy with it (although it's not in the same league as Shake Shack's in New York). This was, of course, just a side dish to his BBQ chicken burger (\u00a36.95). I consider it mandatory that all this be washed down with the beer on tap. Preferably while beating your chest and shouting at the big screen. The pulled pork and ribs are the signature dishes. The ribs are enormous. Even the salads are heart attack inducing. I also love the ample trays of USA condiments on offer \u00a0condiments make us happy. You've probably been already (there's quite a few branches \u00a0we go to the Soho one). If not, for decent quality cow or pig, when you don't want to spend your weekly food budget on some of the limited places in London cooking top notch meat, I think it's a decent goer. If you know a better place for American style barbecue, centrally located, I'd love to hear about it - I'll pass it on to The Peanut Gallery as his birthday present. If you're prepared to pay extra for some of the best pieces of meat in London, go to Hawksmoor or Goodman - but you won't be able to watch the football and howl at the moon while you eat it.",

Downstairs is more like a restaurant while upstairs seems to be more like a take out with tables. You order your food, find somewhere to sit, eat and leave. It's a bit more manic, but it has the advantage of pints of beer. For some reason they only sell bottles downstairs. The food is fantastic if, like me, you like animal and plenty of it. I had a \"jacobs ladder\" while Paul had a selection of chicken, pulled pork (amusingly named shredded bbq pork) and pork ribs. They do an interesting item called \"burnt ends\". However, it's only available at certain times, so I never got to try it. Paul has had it before and says it rocks... I'll have to take his word for it. The ladder was 5 beef ribs which resulted in a slab of meat about the size of a breezeblock. I nearly managed it all, welllll, I was hungry, ok? Been a couple of times now and enjoyed it both times.

    "text": "First time to this small chain and had a nice meal in the deli-up section - I liked that because it was pretty relaxed even though it was busy. \u00a0I tried the \"best sandwich in town\" (Soho Special) which seems debatable as I had earlier had what was definitely a rival sandwich in Exmouth market (yes, I did eat two enormous pork sandwiches on the same day, but I know you won't judge me because you're on Yelp and you love food). \u00a0I would say it was a little on the mushy side, but it tasted good what with all the sugar and the vinegar and tomato and pork. \u00a0I think it could be improved with more crunchiness from the Burnt Ends that were allegedly in there. \u00a0Two of my friends had the Baby Backed Ribs/Pulled Pork combo which they enjoyed, another one had the beef brisket sandwich. \u00a0I thought it was quite reasonably priced, especially the sandwiches.DISCLAIMER: I also enjoy Tony Roma's especially on Tuesday and Wednesday when I can get a starter (i.e. half onion loaf) and main course (i.e. half rack of ribs) for \u00a39.95 so possibly don't trust my taste in BBQ (or, indeed, food at all)...UNLESS: you are in Williamsburg, Brooklyn NY in which case I can tell you that there is quality BBQ at Fette Sau, owned by the same folks as run Spuyten Duyvil, an excellent bar just across the road.",

Menu is pretty much all based around BBQ'd meat - although there is a couple of Veggie options). Meat is delicious especially the Burnt Ends (Beef Brisket served either 'wet' - with bbq sauce or 'dry' without) but not to impressed by the fries and coleslaw that make up the sides, which is a shame as the all the meat options I tried where delicious ( I think the chicken that I nicked off of my fiances plate was the best - really juicy with a lovely marinade!). Sides nice just basic. Overall a little pricey for what it is but still a good night. Defiantly recommend booking as it gets really busy. Go with an empty stomach as some of the portions are generous!",

Outside, on your benches, provided for me, and all the other waiting companions, at which we drink your bar drinks, one by one, until, finally, my name is exclaimed, and gloriously struck off the 'list' whence I may then dash inside to sooth my carnivore cravings, having been tormented by the teasing wafts of BBQ meats.A frenzied consumption of slow cooked pork and deep fried carbohydrates smothered in spicy mayo follows. But you must know the protocol to optimise your experience here:You will have to wait, and it normally doesn't matter if you opt to sit up (diner style) or downstairs (more restaurant like), expect at least an hour for dinner on a week night, longer on weekends. Also don't fall for the pulled pork, if that's all you crave, and crave-you-it-only, go to Pitt Cue around the corner. Bodean's is about the 'burnt bits'. The Soho Sandwich is a damn good sandwich, and trust me the medium sized one is enough, no matter how ravenous your wait has made you, the large will defeat you in almost any case, or leave you uncomfortably over-fed if your ethics object to you leaving anything but a clean plate (ahem...).The cocktail list is great, the 'old fashioned's come real-boozy too, y'all. The prices are jolly decent. If you want ribs go for the baby-back rack, every time.",

My poor mind, it went from clean living to a blunderbuss of pulled pork addiction, again probably immediately after the first time.My poor smile it went from a wry smile to a massive grin after the first time.Our version of American style BBQ? I think so! Sweet succulent meat falling off the bone, ribs - rubbed, marinated and soft, the chicken wings a delight, you can get a massive meal with a drink or two for under \u00a320. It's in Soho, so lots options before or after but I would certainly come here with a very empty stomach.They have two areas; a more casual diner area (slightly longer opening hours and faster service) upstairs with long tables and a restaurant area downstairs which is harder to get to late in the evening. You can't book unless you're a large group but bizarrely you get a lot more for your money downstairs. Go there, but be careful you might not get back up the stairs.Why doesn't this get 5 stars? I couldn't get into the restaurant bit the last time!",

    "text": "Biologically I'm half-Jewish but my dad got thrown out of his synagogue-led Boy Scout troop as a youngster for bringing pork sausages to a picnic, so I've not exactly been brought up on a kosher diet. Which is a good thing because there are pigs-a-plenty on offer at Bodeans . . . along with chickens and cows . . . and not a whole lot else. \u00a0They know what they're doing and they stick to it: lots and lots of meat, in all its many guises, mostly covered with a thick layer of barbecue sauce. Ribs, wings, legs, thighs, pulled pork, burnt ends (nicer than they sound). \u00a0There are sides but they're largely ignored in diners' quests to get as much protein down their faces as humanly possible, and this was perhaps the problem for me.I love meat. \u00a0But I like it with other stuff too. \u00a0The meat at Bodeans is doubtless amazing, but - and there is a but - if that's the kind of meat that you like. \u00a0All-American, chargrilled, dripping with barbeque sauce, full-on protein-fest. \u00a0It all looks the same and frequently tastes it too. \u00a0Not that the same is bad - it's a good same! - but nonetheless, it was difficult to differentiate the chicken from the hunk of pork until (and sometimes after) I'd bitten into it.I was with ten people and we ordered four meat platters between us. \u00a0Half of the group consisted of big South African men and the rest of us were hungry and enthusiastic yet we still barely dented the offerings. \u00a0You certainly can't fault the generosity, nor the staff members (all cheery and helpful), and value for money is extremely good. \u00a0We even had doggy bags to take home the (considerable) leftovers - truly, we were living the American dream.Unfortunately, much as I would love to describe myself as a full-on carnivore, I'm a fan of the old veggies too. \u00a0I mainlined the small portion of coleslaw, hidden under a wedge of beef, before anyone else could get their sauce-drenched hands on it. \u00a0There are salads on the menu, of course, but since even the side portion of BBQ Beans come with the proviso \"contains meat\", I wasn't overly excited by their presence. \u00a0Everything was heavy and hard work to chew. \u00a0They're not promising gourmet cuisine but even so, would a few corns on the cob or tomatoes be so amiss?!Having said all of that, I still managed to stuff an unholy amount of meat into my mouth, and gleefully helped myself to a doggy bag. \u00a0For \u00a320 a head, I had a cocktail, a beer, more meat than I could shake a stick at and dinner for the next two days. \u00a0Now that's good value. Unfortunately I was also so full that I could barely sleep some five hours later, and woke up suffering from meat sweats the following morning . . . so good as those burnt ends were (and they really were), I'm just not sure it's worth the pain. \u00a0I'll return, but not until my internal organs have recovered.",

It's ok pub food, but it's definitely not 'cue.We got the hot wings, \"NFL special\" (3 hot wings, pulled pork, baby back ribs, coleslaw, sweet potato fries, a bottle of Bud) and a hot chicken burger.The hot wings were a hot mess. They were barbecue wings (down to the smoky flavour and sweet barbecue sauce) doused in hot wing sauce (which was pretty solid on its own merit, though it included habaneros and Scotch bonnets which, while lip-tingling, are very much not a part of Buffalo wing sauce in any tradition) and served with that pre-packaged foamy \"blue cheese dressing\" that the UK seems to shove into every \"American\" establishment which tastes nothing like blue cheese (or dressing, for that matter). Seriously, at this point, can you just give me ranch? Or maybe some blue cheese shoved into sour cream? Anything? Also, a full order of wings with two (2) celery sticks is sort of ridiculous.The pulled pork was only ok. It was dry and lacked complexity. The ribs were by far the highlight: tender, a little sweet, smoky. Tasty stuff. The coleslaw was adequate, as were the from-the-freezer sweet potato fries (though the 2.25 up-charge from regular fries is cheeky, guys). The chicken burger was forgettable.What got my goat about this place was the fact that it claims to be a 'cue joint when it's clearly not. There's no actual authenticity to anything: this is a Britified version of \"generic chain restaurant barbecue\" that you'd get in some part of the States that doesn't do hardcore 'cue (anywhere north of the Mason-Dixon line, basically). I wasn't hoping for something like tangy North Carolina-style or saucy South Carolina 'cue, but I wasn't actually expecting totally generic, either.Service was more interested in texting than working, and we had to practically tackle our waitress to get the bill.Get the ribs. Don't get the Bud. Don't get the wings. And if you know a place to get something closer to barbecue (or Buffalo wings, for that matter) in London, for the love of all that is divine, let me know.",

Since it's a very popular place and they don't take reservations, it can build up a quite long queue though, especially on fri-sun nights. Luckily they have a system so you put your name down, and then you can go to the pub across the street and enjoy a pint or two until they text you and say your table is ready! They also have an entire selections of sauces on each table, everything from hot bbq to mustard, which I enjoy quite a lot. I like sauces.",

    "text": "Highly recommend you visit this Bodeans Sunday to Thursday for the \u00a315 game day special. It really is special! The first thing to think about is getting a table - you have two options, turn up early enough (6pm ish) in a small group, or turn up, book, and they'll call you back when they have a table. We did the latter as there was 6 of us, and went for a pint at a pub around the corner. We were told an hour wait at least, but 40min later we were in. The 'Game Day' meal itself is truly excellent. Gorgeously cooked baby back ribs, chicken wings with a sauce to die for, nice (but very salty) chips, dry style coleslaw and a beer - can't really go wrong. The decore is exactly what it looks like - American style diner. You have the option of sitting, canteen style, upstairs, or restaurant style, downstairs - both are fine.Overall, come for the game day special, as long as you can get in, though I would argue that places like Red Dog do arguably better food, Bodeans Game Day Special is without doubt the best value 'American BBQ' style food going.",

    "text": "One word to describe Bodeans: love. As a North American, this is my favourite place to eat in jolly ol' Londontown. The food is great, very North American menu. The atmosphere is great. The service is pretty good for London standards (aka lack of customer service in most places), they tend to be pretty friendly especially at Tower Hill. It is always jam packed. I have visited two of their locations in London, Poland Street and Tower Hill and I would have to say we preferred Tower Hill as it was less busy than Soho (where you are pretty much guaranteed an hour wait- no reservations) and it was nice to be able to have a nice walk around Tower Bridge after devouring as much pulled pork as we could handle. Do get the pulled pork, its awesome. Don't get the ribs unless you enjoy them extremely dry. One of the great joys in life is pulled pork and ribs. However, at Bodeans I have repeatedly ordered the ribs and have been disappointed each time. The last time I ordered them, they were so overdone that they were actually burned at the ends. There is nothing this girl loves more than a barbecue done right, but the state of the ribs brought a tear to my eye this time. The chipotle sauce is awesome, buy a bottle to take home. Yeah, its that good. Bodeans has a Barbecue Bloody Mary on its drink list. Sounds amazing, no? This is not something for the weak spirited. The server's reaction when we ordered it: Are you crazy?! And this is a fitting response. What is a Barbecue Mary, you ask. One word describes this concoction: insane. Think a barbecue version of a traditional Bloody Mary, garnished with a full piece of bacon and made with smoked vodka. Yes, you read that right. Smoked vodka. Does it work? To a degree. It is the strangest tasting drink I have ever tried. I'm not a fan of this one. To be honest, I'm disappointed I didn't like this drink as its pretty much the collision of two of my great loves in life: Bloody Marys and good ol' barbecue. Try it if you are strong willed. But you will understand what I mean by the weirdest tasting drink ever. It kind of works though. Kind of. On the other hand, the Long Island Iced Teas go fabulously with a full barbecue meal. If you're a fan of a good barbecue, this is the place for you. If you know of another barbecue place on par with Bodeans in London, do let me know!",

    "text": "Not a bad BBQ joint, by any means, but not a great one either. Thanks to the erupting volcano underneath the Eyjafjallajoekull glacier in Iceland, my flight home was canceled earlier today and I'm stuck in London for an indefinite period of time. So, I was feeling a little nostalgic for American food. When I heard about Bodeans, it was a no brainer. Not too far from where I'm staying, I headed into SoHo and found Bodeans in no time.I was at first surprised that when they bill the joint as a BBQ deli, DO take that literally. There is no server that takes your order. You get a seat, look over the menu, and head up to the deli counter (often times, waiting in line longer than you'd like to), order, pay, and then get a number. When your food is up, they shout the number out. Kinda old school, which is cool, I guess. But kind of a pain in the ass, too. Especially when you want a second (or 3rd or 4th) beer. Get your ass up and go to the counter.Anyway, the food: I got the combo platter, which is really a good amount of food. Granted, it cost \u00a315, which is kinda pricey after the conversion, but it was 1/4lb of pulled pork, a fat chicken leg, and a 1/2 slab of ribs. Plus a ton of chips (or fries if you want to be 'merican about it), a dollop of mayonaisse (blech) and a heaping cup of cole slaw. But, I hate mayo and cole slaw, so I didn't eat it.First of all, let me be clear, the barbecue sauce was great. Just the right amount of tangy and sweet, and just the right amount of spicy and, well, barbecue-y. The meat, however.... well, let's just say, the cooks need to spend a LOT more time in Memphis or Chicago or even NYC to get it right.The pulled pork was good, a little dry, but good. If the sauce wasn't so good, I would have been pissed off. But I tossed some extra sauce on that pile o' pork and got that ish wet! Yummers.The ribs were not my style at all. Oh, I ate the crap outta them, but they were too tough. I think they were cooked at too high a temperature too quickly. Slow and low... that is the tempo!The chicken was straight up underdone. Truth be told, I like my BBQ chicken somewhat blackened and slightly crunchy on the outside. If I take a big ol bite and the skin is rubbery and stretches off the meat... well, that don't exactly work for this pole cat. The chicken meat was entirely too underdone for me. Nuff said.The chips were spot on. But... their fries. Tough to fuck those up. Again, I didn't try the gross mayo or the yucky cole slaw.And I drank two Sam Adams. I woulda had more if I could get 'em quicker. They were good.Conclusion: If I were with some folks who wanted to go, I'd totally go again. But I'd probably get a pulled pork sammich and pass on the ribs or the chicken. If I could have given it 3.5 stars, I would do that. 4 stars is a little much. I give it a 4-star mostly because, well, shit, it's a valient effort in a city that would never make me think of American barbecue. But I take one star away because, well, it misses the mark. If you're in town and you got a hankering, don't hesitate. Go. But tell me you don't agree that the ribs are too dry. I dare you. :)",

In fact, I have yet to find anywhere in the UK that comes close. \u00a0However, I have lived in the UK for long enough to say that as far as attempts to do BBQ go it is pretty good.I do like that they attempt to be fairly authentic with such nod as offering burnt ends and that sort of thing. I do sometimes think the attempt to slide in other types of 'spicy' non-BBQ based food muddles the waters a bit.A number of times that I have been there it is clear that a more than a few of the customers are home sick Americans, such as myself, looking for a bit of a BBQ fix.

My husband and I arrived 45 mins before the start of the game, and we were glad we had gotten there early! Though we had to get our names on a list we watched as others scrambled to get a place inside the bar or were turned down by the epicly long waiting list. We snacked on onion rings while waiting for their call. Kick-off was getting closer and closer... and just when we were about to give up hope! They called my phone and told us to come downstairs!Not only did our table have an awesome view of their huge tvs downstairs, we were seated and enjoying our Sierra Nevadas before kick-off. Lucky us!Now to the food... as an American who has been to the mid-west... Bodean's BBQ has got it down! Not only was our food cheap for London standards, but the portions were AMERICAN sized! I had the Jacob's ladder ribs and I don't think I've seen so much meat on only 2 ribs before. The burnt ends were also delectable. It just melts in your mouth! I heard the table next to us raving about the mac and cheese... I'll have to come back for that. And the pecan pie, I love pecan pie. And I'll have to come back for the sandwiches... and for the baby back ribs... and for more fries!",

Good points are the nachos starter is one of the best I've had, the beef ribs are good and the double burger great. Only problem is the amount of salt they put in everything. I'm sure my dessert had salt in it too! Pulled pork is nice as are the burnt ends but I still feel they can do better. The upstairs is not worth a visit.

    "text": "\"I want my baby back, baby back ribs\" is usually the song that rings through my head when I know I'll be meeting my friend Ben for ribs at this house of meat on Poland street in Soho. We build ourselves up with a pre-game orange juice at the Star & Garter down the road and then it's full steam in to Bodean's with our rib vests attached. If thinking about where to sit on arrival make sure that, even it's busy, you wait for a seat to become free upstairs, rather than down, as the atmosphere and vibe is far superior on the top deck. Then walk up to the counter and proceed thusly; \"I would like a full rack of baby back ribs served with coleslaw and fries plus a bottle of beer, all for the low , low price of \u00a310.\" It is at this point you feel like asking them if this fantastic deal can be true, but ride it out, as it happens to all of us. Sit back, watch some basketball, hockey or baseball on the big screens and prepare yourself for a feast. The food will be with you momentarily. Once it has arrived, go hard or go home. The meat is dangerously tasty and its easy to see why people get fat, because with food like this in the world who needs a salad? Not me. You get a salad. Make sure you spice your ribs up with some of the spicy sauce lying in the handy condiment containers. Keep close by for the obligitary clean up afterwards as you will need your weight in kitchen role to remove the bbq smile you will inevitably end up with. If the baby back ribs aren't your bag, try the Burnt Ends, These are the thing of legend, but because they aren't part of a deal they will set you back about 12 nuggets. Bodean's is in no way, and should never be considered as, a place to bring your girlfriend on a romantic, but if you want to get back to nature and feel that primordial rush as you rip into a pig's rib cage and you schmeer sauce all down your favourite t-shirt, you really can't go wrong.Same again next month please.",

Its okay for groups though upstIrs it is free seating so if there are more than three of you its hit and miss.It is good for a chilled...hey I am kinda chilled guy...first or second date...or if you have been married for ten years you can be sure your partner won't leave you for going this place. Go... If you get a chance... tell them Agi sent you.... It won't mean a thing to them but it will make me seem really cool when I turn up and say 'Yo I'm Agi'. (I don't actually say yo ) .",

Maybe it's luck, because I've come here several times and have never had a bad meal. The best thing about this is that it's an American-theme restaurant that Americans will actually step into. I come here and I don't feel embarrassed or like an object of amusement that I'm American. Nobody walking around in ten-gallon hats like the Texas Embassy. Just pretty good BBQ, good American beers (NOT Budweiser), and the ballgame's on. Simple.",

If you're unlucky, you might experience over-cooked ribs. Their wings are really good too. I'm not too fond of their pull back pork. I find it extremely dry and tasteless but a lot of people I know enjoys it. The services is not bad... friendly staff and it's a cosey environment.One thing to note is that if you're planning to go somewhere else after having a meal at Bodean's, you're guaranteed you'll smell of Bodean's!",

I've sat in a few American sports bars on my U.S. holiday trips, soaking up the atmosphere and sucking up the food and this is a good place to get that vibe over this side of the pond.The menu is protein and carb heavy with BBQ being the main way of cooking. I like their pulled pork and a special treat are the burnt ends, which are only available on certain days of the week. For Brits, I also recommend trying the corn bread muffins and creamed corn, which are typical American side dishes that you can't find easily over here.There are multiple TVs showing American sports so it's worth positioning yourself at the appropriate table to catch the game you're interested in.I usually stagger out, feeling too full but that's all part of the American sports bar experience!",

Here you have to order and pay for your food at the front counter after this you take your seat and wait for your number to be called. Once you've heard your number being called you identify yourself (put your hand up) and a waiter will bring your food over.Literally 10 minutes after ordering our food came out i was quite surprised as the place was busy and this makes me think that the food was probably microwaved.Between the two of us we ordered a meal and some hot wings. The meal consisted of fries, coleslaw and chicken. The wings where not great!! if it was not for the bbq sauce which I drenched them in I probably would not of eaten them. The main meal was okay the fries and the coleslaw where pretty good however the chicken lacked taste and again was drenched in the bbq sauce.Overall I probably would go back as the concept is good and I like the whole idea however they just need to improve somewhat on the taste of the food!!!",

The slaw, on the other hand, wasn't sweet enough. The BBQ beans lacked beans (but dipped the fries in the sauce), but the shake was perfect. The children in the family who were sitting beside me were excited to be eating \"real American BBQ...\" And I'd say Bodeans did a pretty good job of it.",

    "text": "There's a reason why there are queues out the door every evening in Soho. This place is good, and these queues aren't artificial. The top floor is rammed packed with people turning up at the last minute. It's common to here there's a 1.5-2 hour wait at it's busiest. However you can often leave your details or wait outside and be seated a lot sooner. Book early, and you'll be seated in the more spacious downstairs, which actually isn't as rammed packed, but you'll need a party of at least 8.The service is excellent. Our waitress was helpful and went out their way to check certain items were available, particularly the milkshakes which they stop making at certain times.Note, come here with your appetite in check, because the portions are deceptively large. The sharing platters, a mixture of ribs, baby back ribs, burnt ends, chicken wings are missions in themselves. Some meat was a little dry but that can be forgiven with lots of BBQ hickory sauce available to slother over your meal. The coleslaw was a little bland, the chips perfectly seasoned.I had the chicken buffalo burger. The meat tender and BBQ'd to perfection. It wasn't particularly big, but I was unable to finish my chips or have room for dessert. Prices are extremely reasonable around \u00a315-20 per head, and if you know beforehand you can also ask for a free item of food based on the day of the week, which is a pretty nice touch.

Other than these dorks, the crowd was a nice mix of UK fans of USA football, and oddballs who wanted American BBQ. We sat at the common table and people were chatty and friendly (again sans the Fighting Irish nerds). Good place to go for a fix of footballs and BBQ.

Both came with a giant pile of chips, coleslaw and we paid an extra \u00a31.50 for corn bread. I have to admit, I had no idea what any of these things were before Bodeans, so I am very appreciative of my pork-education.Translation for other English folks that have not yet tried this kind of artery-blocking yumness:* Burnt ends: \u00a0Crispy crusty bits of brisket (mine was dark, juicy chunks of beef in a really good bbq marinade)* Pulled Pork: Slow cooked, melt in the mouth, shredded pork-joy. My friend told me to add the vinegar/spicy sauce before munching it...* Ribs: You all know this one! It's just bbq ribs in a really yummy sauce.* Corn bread: I'd never had this before...it was a bit like a savoury cake that was only improved by dunking it in meat juices.* The coleslaw isn't as mayonnaise-y as I am used to...so I really liked it. The portion sizes were immense! But they provided boxes, cups of extra sauce and lids for the coleslaw...so I have enough for lunch today as well. Woot!",

Seriously, they didn't want to eat anywhere else!I've now discovered that I have a limit at Bodeans. Beer and diablo hot wings fills me up just right. And anything less than diablo and you're a wimp, IMHO ;) The hot wings at the Poland Street restaurant are particularly good.As with every visit to Bodeans, the food was great and the staff were friendly. They managed to fit the four of us in to a massive table which was booked 90+ minutes after we got there so we had loads of time to eat and chill out!We tend to go to one of two of the restaurants, this one and the one at Tower Hill. Tower Hill is my favourite because it's more spacious and has beer on tap but Soho wins for convenient location.If you're never been, go. It may not be the most authentic or even the best in London but it's ALWAYS good.",

My wife and I both swapped our sides which was very easy, I swapped my fries for chilli cheese fries which were very special. We were going to see a show and the speed of service was important and certainly didn't disappoint either.I had 1/2 Chicken with pulled pork & pork sausages. With the fries above & some coleslaw it made for an impressive platter of food. My wife had 1/2 a chicken with sides of onion rings and cornbread muffins. She also had a side of Mac & cheese....her favourite. The side of Mac & cheese was huge!! It was delicious and the sauces were very special. The staff let us know that, should we not be able to finish they would be more than happy to supply us with doggy bags. That wasn't necessary as I had fasted in anticipation of an enormous meal, also not sure how the audience of Cats would have reacted to the smell of the remains of our dinner, not to mention the cats.All in all, highly recommended.",

They have a selection of beers from small American breweries plus some more well known names, a large basement dining area and seating upstairs.

If you like meat, then you'll be in heaven; however, if you're looking for a light lunch, and variety, probably best to move along. For me, the combo is the only way to go; I think it's about \u00a314/15, and is a huge plate of pulled pork, ribs, amazing chips and fresh coleslaw. Not the most exciting or sophisticated food ever, but it's all so tasty it doesn't matter. Definitely not a place to go if you're planning on going out after; it's killed many a night out for me, but that's possibly more down to my own gluttony. Also, not a date restaurant unless you want to see the girl/boy of your dreams working up a meat sweat. Only things I would improve would be the toilets, as they're fairly grim for a restaurant. ps. If you go, it's worth waiting for a table downstairs, as it's a bit bright upstairs and members of the public will see you sucking that last rib dry.",

    "text": "So after trying The Joint in Brixton on Saturday I have continued the search for the ultimate BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich in London, guided by Esquire's \"Where To Get The Best Pulled Pork In London\" list. This time I have ventured to Soho to eat at #2 on the list: esquire.co.uk/food-drink\u2026They have plenty of sitting choices. Don't get scared by some what \"original\" look of the deli shop which is on the ground floor. The sitting space downstairs offers much cozier traditional restaurant apparel. There are also sits outs, for those not scared of London's autumnal weather conditions.Pulled pork sandwich: I have tried the Soho Special. It comes with homemade fries as a side. The pulled pork is reasonably tasty but the bun is of mediocre quality. Or maybe I am just spoiled after trying The Joint.",

The wings were amazing and I had a buffalo chicken sandwich that was to die for. The service was amazing and a little this is one of the best places I've been to in the U.K. \u00a0We ate downstairs and had a lot of room I suggest you do the same. If you are in the Soho area you have to try this out.",

    "text": "The Soho staple, sometimes difficult to get into, but always a good meal. Most recently got a tri-tip sandwich, not thinking that I was hungry enough for ribs. I was expecting a sandwich, albeit a slightly expensive one. What I got was a full meal that left me struggling to stay awake for the rest of the afternoon. Having used my lunchbreak to run errands for the office I stopped by and ordered takeout. Here's the thing though, it can take a while to get your food. Your order will go into the same queue as everybody else, and they only make 2-3 orders at a time as there are only two guys back there prepping everything (thankfully, being BBQ, there's only so much that needs to be fired off and cooked from scratch.The sandwich was big, bigger than the pulled pork ones, and was piping hot when I got it. By the time I got back to the office, it was a bit more manageable. All I can say, dang that's some good tri tip. Unfortunately the ketchup provided was some no name brand in little sachets that really didn't do much justice.",

The pulled pork meat was tender and flavourful though the ribs was a bit dry. My husband and I both agree that our meals were still enjoyable overall. \u00a0My brother in law on the other hand indulged himself on the medium cooked double patty burger. I had a small slice of his meat patty and I was pretty darn good. It was well-seasoned, moderately juicy and beefy and seared just right. I guess I know what I will be ordering next time I come back to Bodeans. It was absolutely a satisfying meal after a disappointing one from Fish!In the end, though we had sauce everywhere in our face and hands, our stomachs were full and happy. Bodeans...we'll be back!",

Although I am not a big fan of my food served on a tray upstairs I think the dish combination is better. Also it was too dark in the restaurant, it made me want to fall asleep.We shared one of the combo and the thunder chicken thighs. But I found the thunder chicken tasted really burnt. In the dark you would not realise how burnt it was until we put it under a bright torch light and saw the skin was almost black. It was disappinted since I love my chicken thighs.",

For a BBQ joint, I was quite disappointed by the quality of the meat and they way it was cooked. My friend who's been a few times only gets the pulled pork because she said the ribs were too dry. My boyfriend and I got the BBQ sharing platter so we could try all the meats. My friend was completely right, the ribs were way too dry and burned in a bad way, and the chicken was okay. The only good option was the pulled pork. If it wasn't for my friend's 10% off card, I would have found Bodean's to be overpriced, when the only decent thing on the menu is pulled pork. They really need to improve their ribs!",

It's a great take on good old fashioned American BBQ joints, and if you're into your American sports, you can find baseball and football games playing on the tv screens dotted around the table and comfy booths. \u00a0 Expect to wait on an evening for a seat downstairs in the resturant, this place gets busy really quickly! If you can't wait, or simply want a quick bite to eat, they have a cool deli upstairs where you can get food to go or sit on the communal tables instead. \u00a0 Don't forget to ask for a Bodeans Q card too, you can use this throughout all their locations to get great deals during the week like 2 for 1 or discounted drinks and free deserts.",

Lots of sauce options. The burger looked too industrial (perfectly round, sharp edges). Flavour: sadly, there wasn't any. The meat tasted dry and bland. It left a heavy feeling in the stomach afterwards. I asked for medium rare but it same all cooked through, which added to the dryness. There are so many great burger options in soho so, while this place may b great for ribs and other things (not tried), avoid the burger there.",

    "text": "Bodeans has been one of my top spots to eat in London. I have been coming here from the time it's been open. I stumbled on it when I was coming to the Phonica Records store next to it, also the fact that it is located on Poland street has a special meaning to me as I was born in Poland. The location is great, central London 2 minutes from Oxford Street, closest tube station is Oxford Circus.The place itself has a ground floor with high bar tables and few tables outside and a basement level. The ground floor is a sort of a deli and takeaway fast-food joint but the basement is called the rib room and looks and feels more like a typical restaurant. The place is always full so if you want a sit book or come in advance. During lunch time you can see a lot of people dropping by to pick up takeaway orders. Overall the feel is US oriented with American Football or baseball playing on the wall mounted TVs.The food, well I love it. This place introduced me to some of the best pulled pork I ever had. The chips/fries sweet and paprika covered with the sweet hawaiian sauce are just delicious! The coleslaw is fresh made so it is very crunchy. I tried over the years almost everything here so can recommend the ribs, burgers as well but definitely my top picks are deli sandwiches pulled pork and Boston butt, they do come with fries and coleslaw. You can have regular or large. When I came here first I did order Large and the size was impressive, similar to those American Large meal sizes. Worth having are also the Combo meat meals or the sharers, again good size if you are hungry with one of your party. \u00a0There is much I can write about their food but just to summarize, the food is great quality, good portions, good value and overall it's delicious. Plus you can use an unlimited quantity of their own made BBQ sauce which is just PERFECT! You can buy it at the ground floor deli. I always have some at my home! Definitely come here and have some great US craft beers as well.",

    "text": "Barbecue, I have missed you. I'm sorry for moving away from you to here, the Olde Worlde. After being tempted by another Bodean's that has since closed (and is now so recorded on Yelp), I was cautious about letting my stomach know that this was a possibility lest there be another disappointment.But we knew within a block. The smell of chargrilled meat! We're coming for you! Here we are! What are we having? Chicken? Ribs? Pork? Want! Want! WANT! Time to start salivating! It was like my digestive system was a child on Christmas morning.I managed to shut it up with an \"imported\" American beer while I made my decision. Order and pay at the clearly labeled \"order here!\" till (\"register\" in American) and get your number. Then go back to your table, rubbing your hands together at the prospect of consuming flesh! A few minutes, my ears caught the \"264!\" being shouted and my food was brought to me. A tray of \"burnt ends\" and a pile of pulled pork with another pile of fries (none of these Brit 'chips' thankyouverymuch) and a plastic cup of slaw. The meat was tender and the sauce was spicy and sweet. The fries perhaps weren't very hot, but the slaw was tart. All told, pretty darned good especially considering it was served on a plastic tray. No, not a plate on a tray. Just a piece of butcher paper on a tray. Like they'd ever do THAT at a British restaurant!There's a former six-pack container on the table to hold condiments like ketchup and two kinds of barbecue sauce. Also a roll of kitchen paper for wiping up the bits that didn't quite make it all the way into your mouth.Really good food and \u00a0\u00a315 or so for a full plate (less for a sandwich, more for a full rack of ribs). Quite possibly the only place in London you'll find American beers like this. Lone Star? Really? Yes, really.The TV's hanging from the ceiling were tuned in to ESPN America. Who knew there was such a thing? Boston and Vancouver Stanley Cup, followed by the Yankees kicking some Cleveland behind. I get the impression that they show all the US sports here.Oh, it was good. Oh, I was stuffed. Oh, I will be back!",

    "text": "So first time eating here as a veggie, back in my meat eating days I've been here a few times.It was a group of 5 of us and as my friend was fasting we were late diners, it's a little annoying that we cannot book so when we rocked up at 9pm and were told it would be an hour wait, it wasn't the most convenient (we were at the Soho one), we left up to my fasting friend to make a decision so he decided to grab a snack from Yo Sushi and we would wait, all good. When we were seated about 10pm they were prompt with the service, there was a little bit of confusion when my friend asked for grapefruit juice and was told they don't serve it, despite him visiting the restaurant regularly and knowing they did so that was a bit of kerfuffle.Now the food, I had the grilled veggie sandwich, sweet potato fries, coleslaw and creamed corn, the sandwich was really good although the tomato wasn't actually grilled and goats cheese is always a staple veggie item (but it was good especially after a bottle and a half of wine), by far better were the sweet potato fries, they were actually crispy (so many times I have had sweet potato fries and they are just soggy roasted sweet potato), the creamed corn was also delicious. Three of us ordered the White Zinfandel bottle to split, it wasn't the greatest wine it was quite cloyingly sweet, but I figure Bodean's doesn't sell itself on the wine so... Overall the mains were good, there were no complaints from anyone, my friends beef brisket sandwich looked met in your mouth amazing and another one of our group had a HUGE burger that looked epic. What was really disappointing was that when we came to order desserts we were told the kitchen shuts at 11pm and it's 11.25pm so we couldn't, overall I don't actually have a problem with that, if the kitchen is closed then, it's closed, staff need to go home too. What I was annoyed with was, at NO point did the waiter tell us during our meal or when we first ordered that the kitchen would close at 11pm and therefore if we wanted to order desserts or anything else we should do so before 11pm. He halfheartedly suggested cocktails but since 2 people weren't drinking... Yes we were late diners because of my friend fasting but we couldn't book in advance, we waited an hour for a table, where was the kitchen closing warning? We spent nearly \u00a3100 which would have been more if we could \u00a0have ordered desserts, we may have even ordered further drinks, as it was we paid up and left.Overall the food was great, the service needs work.",

Thomas A. introduced me to it, and while Sarah O. might think it's not authentic enough, I think it's authentic enough to cure any BBQ cravings that I come up with while out here.I don't eat pork, or ribs so a few of the things were off the menu for me, but they still had a lot of chicken options, including the chicken sandwich that i INHALED after DRENCHING it in that DELICIOUS BBQ sauce. Seriously, the sauce was so good i was considering giving myself a sweet BBQ sauce facial right there at the table, but mother taught me to never pour condiments on your face during dinner. (at least while in public)Originally I wanted to order the beef brisket, but they only prepare it on certain days, and I wasn't there on one of them. But the prices(in the upstairs part, I can't speak for downstairs) were so cheap that I can't really hold that against them.It was so American that even the guy at the till was american. I loved it. this shall be my place to go when I miss American BBQ.",

    "text": "I finally went here this weekend after hearing so much about it, and I have to say it lived up to expectations but didn't exceed them. I have absolutely no complaints, I thought the food was good and the service was excellent (friendly without being TGI Friday's pushy) but I wasn't absolutely wowed liked I expected to be. Perhaps it was the plastic menus, tiny drinks and fast food atmosphere that I wasn't quite expecting? Food wise, to start I had pulled pork quesadillas, which were generous and came with loads of sides (a good thing, I'm addicted to guacamole). Apparently the chicken gumbo is worth the trip alone too, and the starters are definitely worth investigating. That said, what you really come for is the mains. It's BBQ and steak a go-go, and I had it on good authority that I should try the steak. It was cooked perfectly, served up on a skillet to keep in the heat, and came with just the right amount of chips. All in all, no complaints! They know what they're doing with their mains, the lamb ribs also looked really good. Price wise, it's what you'd expect for a steak in a chain in London. The meal for three came to \u00a390 which isn't really bad for starters, mains and a fair few cocktails. Making the drinks bigger would help thoughserving coke out of 250ml glass bottles when you're serving up such big portions of salty food is just mean!",

This branch also has a special offer where you can get a rack baby back ribs, fries, coleslaw and a drink also for only 10 pounds. That's cheap for the amount of meat you're getting. My preference is for the ribs since I think the pulled pork is pretty lousy. But besides these, they also serve chicken and assorted derivative dishes off these meat. Service was good, where waiters/waitresses were attentive and didn't force the issue that some of our party hadn't arrived yet.",

I had the biggest ever craving for some pork and ribs, after seeing the amazing reviews of Bodean's, I hopped skipped and ran to the place hoping to be blown away by this good old comfort food.The portions were decent sized and the food was served up on just a few minutes, so for you hungry sports fans, it might just be the perfect place to go especially if you're going to be glugging down a few cans of Coors with your eyes glued to the screen. But note, the nachos looked like they came out one of those pre-packed lunch boxes that they used to sell in the supermarkets for kids and as for the salsa the salsa, well I don't even want to go into that. The coleslaw was a huge flop, it was absolutely flavourless and I don't even consider myself to be picky.The star of the show, well it felt like I signed up to watch one disastrously out of tune tribute band. Both the ribs and pulled pork were extremely dry and even with great lashings of the BBQ sauce, it was beyond saving. I would have given this place 2 stars except for the fact that I did have quite high expectations considering the last BBQ joint I went to was in Texas. I'll probably give this another shot considering it's been consistently rated so highly by fellow yelpers, so fingers crossed that it was just one unlucky evening for me!",

    "text": "If you're craving for that 'meat fix' then come to Bodeans! Upon entrance the first thing I noticed was the 'three-legged cow' staring at you before you've even made it to the counter! If you're upstairs, you got long aisle dining with TVs at enough angles to see in 360 view! Most of the time when I've been, it's usually American Football playing, but I have had the rare occurence of a Basketball game playing. Right, the food....two words: Simply Sublime! It doesn't quite cut it having tasted a 'true' American barbeque, but it sure does come in a a very close second place. My favourite for a while was the 'Pig Out For A Tenner', just a well dirty, meaty meal! Then I moved on to the Boston Butt: Pulled Pork with coleslaw in a bun (just get to the barbeque sauce quickly)! And now I'm stuck at the K.C Brisket Special! They also have the best onion rings I've ever tasted in my life! However, there are a couple things I don't like, I'm not too hot on the baskets they use for the burger meals, yeah its great to pretend your on the 'Saved By The Bell' set for a while, but it just seems like its been squashed into it. Another small gripe is the that they've introduced putting butter on the buns, not a huge fan. Aside from those little nicks, everyone needs to experence Bodeans at least once in their life, just try getting there sooner rather than later.....Oh and when you go, make sure you help yourself to an A & W root beer to wash down all that meaty goodness!...",

Particularly the beef ones. The tastiest items, in my opinion are the pulled pork (Juicy pork, slow cooked on the bbq till it falls apart) and 'burnt ends' which are the juicy ends of ribs. Everything is done in an American style- large portions, drinks like 'moosehead' beer, deserts such as apple cobbler and key lime pie. This is a good place for a large meal, but really be prepared for a large meal- for example the 'combo' plate includes 1/4 of a chicken, ribs, pulled pork, chips and coleslaw! Tasty but for me, too much food to return regularly!!",

It's always busy, the staff are good and the atmosphere is great - just people unashamedly enjoying far too much meat and beer. The decor is pretty cool as well. Almost everything I have had of the menu on numerous visits has been perfect. Beef ribs, pork ribs, burgers, chips, salads (!). On certain days they do Pig out for a Tenner, where you get ribs, pulled pork, fries, coleslaw and a beer. Probably the best offer in town. As much as I go there, I can't get enough of this place. There is almost nothing negative I can say about this place, but book if you can. It's one of those places where you get a certain amount of time to eat, but it's more than worth it.",

I like to sit around and read comics instead. However, she's a vegetarian, so I felt we could happily approach this from both sides.I've also decided to compress my reviews as I tend to digress. A lot.Bodeans has a nice layout with a deli style upstairs complete with a big cow and a lounge/lodge/dark/odd downstairs sans big cow. I'm pretty sure the menu is similar except downstairs you get table service. Our table service was fine, but by no means fast. The food was average, and I have to confess at being very disappointed at the ribs. The BBQ sauce and hot sauce was very tasty, but I have experienced better ribs at a Frankie & Benny's.I know.The chicken was average also, it was juicy enough, but a little tasteless. The chips were pretty salty and moreish which is always good but not exactly a revelation. However, the pulled pork was absolutely delicious and that is what gives it 3 stars for me. I'd like to go back and try the burnt ends as I have heard good things and I would probably try the deli instead, but they best I can say is that is was average. However I am perfectly prepared to concede that it may have been an off day. We all have those.",

    "text": "Now this is great BBQ as we know it in the USA!Bodeans does not take reservations but for some reason there is always a seat available. Most of the seats upstairs are the bench type but unknown to many there is a large seating area downstairs. I didnt know this until I was using the restroom when we were about to leave. I had a milkshake there that was possibly the best I have ever had. The BBQ and fries were spot on. When you get in line to order it seems to take a while but it is worth the wait. And they bring the food to you once you have ordered and paid. A definite place to visit to eat in London.",

No celery salted rim, very watered down, even the Clamato felt watery. Not recommended. Starter: Memphis nachos \u00a38.75. Where do I even start? The chips were store bought and already flavored with something powdery that messed up the overall flavor. The cheese... what cheese? There was no cheese, only a few pieces of pickled jalape\u00f1o thrown on top of some watery sour cream of sorts. This starter really disappointed us.Bodean's platter for two \u00a327.50. Meat was decent, the ribs mostly. Chicken thighs a bit dry, but not bad per se. The burnt tips were meh. Tasted like goulash meat to us and not in a good way. Side of mac & cheese was pale and unimpressive. Tasted like it came from packaged powder, and likely did. Coleslaw: straight awful. We each had a fork of this slaw and put it down. Neither of us tried it again, it's way soaked in mayo and has no other flavor. Sweet potato fries: decent.Regular fries: salty but ok. Bottom line: it was just okay. We won't be back or recommend to others. It's okay only if you have low expectations, which we didn't, considering the booked up nights they have here.",

    "text": "I was recently in London for a week and found myself roaming around Soho one evening. I stumbled across Bodean's and was instantly intrigued. An American BBQ place in the heart of London town. Heck yeah! The place looked pretty friendly from the outside and had some picnic tables out front which beckoned me however there were some random smokers who thought those tables would make a great perch. This made my decision to sit inside pretty easy. I picked a place at the bar along the windows to people watch given that I was alone. The hostess and waitress were both very friendly and brought me a menu right away. I looked it over and immediately my mouth started watering.What caught my eye was the \"Soho Special,\" a mix of burnt ends and pulled pork, and how it was named the \"best sandwich in London\" by someone at Capital Radio. Do they know anything about BBQ? Maybe. Either way, it sounded delicious. Then I saw the \"KC Brisket Special\" and was a little shocked. Why on earth would you put cheese and onion rings on a brisket sandwich? Brisket is a delicious cut of meat smoked low and slow for hours. If you need to add \"extra flavour,\" as the menu put it, to your brisket I question the quality of your brisket and/or your cooking. This would get you shot in both Kansas City and Texas, two places famous for their brisket and where the art of BBQ might as well be a religion.I settled on the \"Soho Special\" with chips and a coke. While waiting I couldn't help but notice a TV playing with a replay of the previous night's MLB game and my hometown Chicago Cubs! Nothing makes me happier than seeing my Cubbies on the telly half way around the world...When my food arrived it looked good however the taste didn't live up to the menu's hype. For starters, there were supposed to be two different meats on my sandwich and I couldn't discern one from the other. Burnt ends are the ends off a rack of ribs and generally have a bit of char. Pulled pork, on the other hand, is finally chopped pork which tends to be more succulent. My sandwich seemed to have an amalgamation of the two which was quite disappointing. Making matters worse, the meat was incredibly salty! I proceeded to cover the sandwich with the smokey hickory BBQ and finished it off however I could have done without so much salt. As for the sauce, it was actually really good and I would have bottled it up and brought it home with me if I could. Too bad I had to use it to mask the saltiness of the sandwich.I wanted so very much to love this place but my American BBQ tour of Europe (had BBQ a week earlier in Dublin) continued on it's disappointing course. The atmosphere of this place was great and I'd come back for that alone but the food left me wishing I'd gone elsewhere. The staff were great, as was the sauce, but the centerpiece of my meal, the meat, was pretty lackluster. 2 stars for the food 4 or 5 stars for everything else.... 3 stars overall.",

This is how it all began! After a few drinks (don't judge me) last night my sister and I knew we had to tend to our empty stomachs ... I had seen Bodeans many times before but always assumed they only did pork lol . Yesterday I looked at their menu! I was impressed! Their restaurant downstairs has a different menu with Mexican and seafood options but there was over an hour's wait for seats and this princess does not wait that long for food so we sat upstairs.I kid you not its soooooo resonably priced I felt I should've paid more! The quarter of a chicken I had was only \u00a37.94!!!! And it came with chips and slaw! It was a huge portion and I barely made a dent in it! Flavour wise!? We are talking flavour town,flavourville,flavour capital! Soooooo delicious it's unreal and for that price? Are you kidding me?! I wanted to kiss the cook just to show how much I loved it! Oh and if you're there also try the thunder thighs in bourbon! Omgggggggggg critical stuff!! Will I be going? Don't ask stupid questions! ;)",

So did it live up to the hype, I hear you ask?! Too damn right it did! Mmm hmm mmm! The chicken was grilled to perfection with sweet bbq and so tender! Pure deliciousness! I changed my coleslaw for a side salad, slightly more expensive, but it was drizzled with some insanely nice dressing! Under 10 pounds for chicken, fries and salad! What is this?!! Cannot be central London can I?! Too right it is! I saw a new beer on the menu, so obviously washed the feast down with a beer. It was a Mexican lager, which was kinda average, but I'm sucker for trying new things. No regrets! The fact that this has a more formal down satirise restaurant and the deli makes it even more appealing. It's basically my go to place now for chicken when I'm feeling the craving!",

They also do things like steaks, burgers, salads and hot dogs, but seeing as BBQ food is their speciality you'd be crazy not to go with one of the former.The BBQ burnt ends are lush and one of my favourite things on the menu - slow cooked flavoursome chunks of beef brisket. If you're going with a friend I'd recommend the Bodean's sharing platter - pretty affordable at \u00a326 - which comes with fries and coleslaw and gives you a little bit of everything.If you sign up for their loyalty Q Card you get various freebies and discounts throughout the week. Last time I went I got a free portion of chicken wings. \u00a0It's free to join so there's really no reason why you shouldn't!This joint of Bodean's is in the heart of Soho and very popular so you will have to wait a while, especially if you want to sit downstairs in the proper restaurant area. Waiters have always been friendly when I've been and service generally quite efficient.",

The seating up there is long shared tables, but there is enough space to sit and eat comfortably (unlike in many other similar establishments). The atmosphere is very laid back and there are American sports channels on the TVs, which adds nicely to the diner feel.I ordered what I always get from any American BBQ place - pulled pork. I'd had this before at the Bodean's in Tooting and it blew my mind, thankfully it was just as good at this branch! I also ordered a side of creamed corn and corn bread, both were great. I knocked a star off because they weren't very attentive with the service. My friend & I both had a Scarlett O'Hara cocktail which dangerously just tasted like cranberry juice - we sat for a while after finishing our food and they could have got at least another 2 cocktails out of us if they'd asked if we wanted anything else!",

The classic place where you go get the real American experience, stuff your face with BBQ delicacies & watching football. Alas, sports and I just don't match. But the food was DELICIOUS. We were a party of 7, it was an impromptu birthday lunch on a Thursday and we were seated immediately in one of their cave-like booths. Really low ceiling but spacious table and benches, and they even managed to squeeze in a small flat screen (as they do). I've had a strawberry milkshake (YUM) and one of their combo plates that included a quarter of BBQ baby back ribs slab, 1/4 chicken, pulled pork, slaw and fries. About \u00a316 if I'm not mistaken. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it, everything was spot-on. AND I DON'T EVEN LIKE BBQ STUFF (usually). People with me ordered a variety of plates that included a full slab of baby back ribs, \u00a0creamy corn (which looks yucky but hey, don't judge by the cover), beautiful sandwiches and even a massive Caesar salad with added chicken, of which glories were praised. I'm honestly so hungry right now, writing this review is torture. If you like BBQ stuff, you'll love this place. Hell, I'm not a fan of BBQ sauce and I can't wait to go back. I can see how people would want to come back here for lunch every day of their life until an obesity-induced heart disease knocks on the door. Only keeping one star because I don't really have tried a lot of different BBQ places so I don't have much to compare it with, and because there was a weird leaking coming from the light fixture that didn't scream 'safety' to me.",

I've actually tried something different each time I've been to make sure I really taste my way around the menu and I'm yet to have anything I haven't enjoyed (except maybe the cornbread, just give me more meat and/or cheese)! In no particular order I'd fully recommend the chilli cheese fries (definitely enough to share between two if ordering as a side to a main). The burnt ends and pulled pork are both delicious, particularly when topped with more of their BBQ sauce provided on each table. Their plain fries are seasoned perfectly and are utterly delicious. The pulled pork quesadilla makes a great lunch option as well as a starter, as it's fairly substantial. Oodles of gooey cheese, BBQ sauce and pulled pork in a crispy tortilla - what's not to love?! The Mac n Cheese as a side order is tasty, creamy and a really large portion. The pulled pork side is also generous (and delicious piled upon aforementioned Mac n Cheese). The key lime pie is a perfect balance of sweet and refreshing. Their coffee however, is a little bitter for me. One of the other great perks of Bodean's is the fact they offer FREE kids meals between 12-5pm every day (including weekends and bank holidays). For this reason alone I've pushed my review from 4 stars to 5! Only thing better than a good meal is a good meal with a great family incentive as eating out around London can be expensive.",

    "text": "On a recent shopping trip and after working up quite a sweat in the thralls of Oxford Street my boyfriend declared he was hungry and needed meat. When my boyfriend says this one must act fast before the feet stamping and general sulking take place. So of course I pandered to his needs as we stormed through Soho, I kept asking where we were going but he appeared to have lost all conversation skills and could only muster grunts and an occasional 'to get meat'. Eventually we arrived at this mysterious house of meat, sat ourselves on a stool, and looked at the menu. My dear boy had done well, as this truly was the meatiest place in town. With choices of ribs, sandwiches, burgers, steaks or a combination of everything my carnivorous side was unleashed. The boy, quell surprise, had a combination of just about everything and I had a rack of ribs, well one has too in such an establishment. Now, dear readers, I have been reared on ribs since I could eat solids and I was not about to dash all previous experience because I was lost in the romance of the boy having cocktail sauce in his beard. We were in the upstairs 'fast food' area as the restaurant didn't open for ten minutes, and I was informed we would certainly not be waiting ten minutes. In the fast food part of the restaurant you are to go and make your order at the counter and then the food comes in a basket which you grab when your number is called. I am sure the food is much the same, I personally don't lie the 'do everything yourself' approach but then my good friends may describe me as lazy. However, that aside, the food was pretty damn good. Excellent value for money. There was more meat than I knew what to do with and it was all tasty, although the ribs weren't as meaty as I've had before. Randomly, the sauces were the selling point for me, the cocktail sauce and various chili sauces made me a very happy bean as I do like to load my food with as many condiments as humanly possible. The whole meal for 2, with him having a beer was about \u00a325 which I think is A OK! Saying that we did go on a Tuesday where they have combo dinners for \u00a310. There seems to always be some kind of offer so I suggest checking out the website.",

So when the meat cravings get too much, the quorn sausages stop hitting the spot and when I don't want fish, I grab some mates and we all go to Bodeans to satiate a carnivorous lust burning inside each and every one of us. I feel like I am having a sordid and dirty affair when I go to Bodeans, I can't wait to get my hands on the ribs, and the pulled pork. I love that spicy mayo that comes with it. I usually opt for the Pig Out meal deal, but have tried a few other things too. The steaks are great, but then so are the burned ends! That is why I advise you go in a small group, then you can all share and try everything when you indulge in having a meat orgy. I have never been able to at more than a main there as the portions are mahoosive. Go there starving and leave satisfied, reeking of barbecue - your partner will know where you've been and what you've been up to but this is one guilty pleasure I cant give up.",

    "text": "OK so here's an important update to the Bodean's experience. I go pretty regularly. - they still do the best nachos in London (the Nachos Supreme), but they're only available downstairs. - you can't book the downstairs restaurant anymore unless you're in a large-ish group. I think it's 10 or more people. So don't bother calling. Get there early, stick your name down and wait for them to call in one of the nearby Soho locals. It's worth the wait anyway, you need to be hungry. - stick to what they're good at: which is BBQ. The ribs, chicken and sausage are all great. The other 'specials' and burgers are pretty disappointing really. - ask if they're serving the Jacob's Ladder. It's a special only, and is an enormous 2 or 5 bone beef rib. The \u00a318.95 5 rib version is probably the largest single main course you can buy in any London restaurant. If they have it, get the 2 bone version. It's monumental and as close to a genuine USA rib experience you can get. Hope this helps fellow meat-lovers :-)",

The restaurant is in the heart of Soho but is definitely sucessful in recreating the simple Atlanta chicken 'n' ribs joint it's trying so hard to emulate. You sit on stools at long counters, there's rolls of paper towels next to you, crappy American and Mexican beer, ESPN on the tube, fantastic blues music playing, and portion sizes that could feed a small English village. Heaven, absolute freakin' heaven. I ordered up a combo meal - no waiter service here, you get your butt to the cash register and order. When the food came (very promptly) my 1/2 chicken and ribs was served on a tray. No plate. And it was a tray the size you'd see your Big Mac and Fries on at a McDonald's. That's how much food we're talking about. The chicken and ribs were outstanding, juicy, tasty and well seasoned/marinated. There's a choice of normal or chipotle BBQ sauce, but of which are excellent. To top it all off they have A&W root beer AND French's mustard. Bravo Bodeans, Bravo.",

Here's what he has to say about his first trip to Bodeans I like Bodeans very much. It's much nicer than Qype HQ. There is more beer and pretty waitresses. I tried to drink as much as I could when people weren't looking, but I didn't feel like beer. Instead I decided Margeritas were the best option - especially as they were only \u00a33.95! They were yummy but made me very thirsty so I had more sneaky. They made a bit of a pigs ear out of the seating, but I hear rumours that they don't take bookings anymore. If you're in a big group this is a pain, but it's not so much of a problem for a little ninja like me. Tuesdays are half price steak day at Bodeans which means it's about \u00a37.50 for steak and chips. I like my steak rare and it was perfect. I also stole some of Andrews pulled pork which was very yummy too but I think if I can back I'd choose the steak. It would have got more expensive quickly with a lot of sides though. The cheesecake was fantastic and I really could have eaten another piece. But then everyone decided that they wanted to take photos of me so I had to go and play at being the peforming ninja. Again. Hopefully I'll get to go back very soon. I like it here. Lots. * So there you go. His name is Eric Ninja by the way. Great night.",

Maybe I was getting drunker and they started tasting nicer?), and a pretty good margaritas for my first taste of one, I think. As mentioned, its a bit of a pain that they no longer take bookings - and as a big group we struggled a couple of times to get everyone a seat. But all worked out well. The desserts looked lovely, and next time i go back I might have to try the pulled pork if i can pull myself away from the perfectly done steak. (Tip: the side of grilled onions might seem an unnecessary expense, but they were darn good with the steak and chips). Very good service, efficient and friendly staff. Pretty waitresses too, if like some (not mentioning any names) you choose to ogle them!",

They have everything - burgers, sandwiches, pulled pork, burnt ends, ribs etc. The only downside is this Poland St site seems to have removed the meatloaf from the menu which was my favourite (if anyone has a good meatloaf recommendation in London please let me know!)The side dishes are great too - I'm partial to the corn bread, onion rings and creamed corn. Most of all, I have to recommend the chips. I don't really like chips much and will usually substitute them for something else on the menu but these chips are to die for. They're not very salty, but they're slightly seasoned. Always soft and not too crispy.I also love that they have huge screens with sports on - although it's usually hockey. The atmosphere is great and you can chose from 2 different areas. Upstairs is more like a diner and downstairs is a restaurant (a bit dark but you get over that).I can't get enough of this place.",

Fail on my part, but here we go...One night, myself and my other American friends, went to Bodean's to celebrate Thanksgiving. Instead of making our own dinner, we were super excited to find a place that has a \"traditional\" T-day menu AND bbq! So, off we went. Now keep in mind, us Americans know how to do BBQ right and this place was alright. Probably the best in London. To the Americans, don't go here for Thanksgiving, it's just a heartbreak. It's not going to be the same as your own home cooked meal. The redeeming qualities: the BBQ sauce and RANCH!!! I really don't know why the British don't have ranch like we do in the states but oh well. I would def recommend this place, great vibe and pretty good BBQ.",

Split level dining with the cheap seats at the entrance and the ordering/serving bar right as you go in. An almost bewildering array of options available which give the impression that you should order more than one dish ... which could be a mistake. While not generous in the traditional US manner, the portions here are substantial. On more than one occasion I would have preferred being wheeled out having dined in a surfeit of flesh.The magic ingredient here is pulled pork, the delicious soft aromatic pig dish that not many people do well. It's an agonisingly slow cooking process that makes the meat so delicious and a must with any combo. The rib selections are amazing and delicious and even the burgers are just mouthwatering. An array of drink options can include such US standards such as root beer and cream soda along with classic 'sodas' and beers. Dining up top can mean squeezing into a chair against the wall on the busy SoHo street and people watching or bunching up with other diners on the long tables and high stools in the main restaurant. This can be a real social experience but you can always plump for the table service restaurant if you are feeling grumpy or claustrophobic. Sports usually plays on the screens around the place but the sound is turned down. You can have conversations there as it's not particularly noisy.While the food is not expensive, neither is it particularly cheap but makes up for it with the portions and the quality. Staff are really pleasant and very helpful so makes you feel inclined to return ... and I do so fairly regularly.",

Spots like this in England are very few and very far between (if another even exists???) so it's always a very welcome change to the endless kebab and chip shops littered across this country. I really like the pulled pork sandwich. I also enjoyed the burnt ends dish I had a year ago. Yeah in the end it is a barbecue spot in England, which I'm sure will turn off many American barbecue \"purists\", but it's still worth a visit.

For dinner we had the meat platter which gave us all a bit of everything, pulled pork, ribs, burnt ends, chicken etc. washed down by a few unusual American beers. There was plenty to eat for all four of us, truly great value.

I speant over half an hour in here just waiting to place an order and then waiting for my order to be made. They do offer a call and pik up service which I would suggest doing if you are coming here on your lunch break. As I mentioned previously, the volume of food is generous! The chicken wings I had were HUGE. However, on the downside the chicken wasn't cooked well enough for me (very pink) and there were still feathers on the skin which completely put me off. Although I personally doubt I'll come back Bodean's certainly ticks all the boxes for my BBQ meat loving friends.",

I hail from the south in the U.S. so I have experienced some good bbq in my day and Bodean's can hang in well with the rest of them. The sauce has a nice sweet and spicy flavor that all BBQ sauces should have. The pork is gorgeously tender. It is served on a plain white roll and comes with some thick cut fries (and some sort of garlic mayo) which are crispy enough for me. The price also isn't too bad for what you are getting. (I spent about 7 pounds.) My only real complaint is that they should follow true southern form and \u00a0offer some sweet-potato fries!!! It is a must for bbq.",

Not the same as I've had at Memphis in May, but I can't get BBQ like that ANYWHERE in the states. What had me scratching my head was the fries. They're called \"Seasoned Fries\" and I'm pretty sure they were seasoned with sugar and salt. It was an odd combo and just took away from the whole experience. I still can't get over the gritty syrypy flavor of the fries. I'm hoping it was just an off day... but then I didn't come here for the fries!Cocktails and drinks were plenty, and the service was very good. I'd never make a trip to London simply to go here, but if I found myself in the neighborhood with a hankering for a place that was reminiscent of home, I might find myself face-deep in Bodean's brisket again.",

Oh look the Yankies are playing... super! \u00a0Bodean's have a life sized cow statue, a pig as a door handle and BBQ on the menu. What exactly do you expect? We got a lovely staff girl, very patient and willing to attempt to pronounce French wine names and open a fresh bottle. Bodean's, hog tie that mofo, you can bet your ass i'll be back.",

But I have to say, all my fears were quickly dashed once we were inside. Eight of us crammed into a snug booth downstairs, knees touching under the table, elbows touching either side. But it made for a great atmosphere, with fab service and plenty of happy punters. My veggie option was a vegetable burger but, hey, I really don't have grounds for complaint! You know what you're expecting when you go here. Great for mates and dates.",

I love the wide variety of authentic tasting wings, ribs, beef and pork, the cheap(ish) cocktails, and super chilled out setting. It's true that my love affair has cooled off a little over the last few visits due to some dry rib crimes by the chef and annoyingly lengthy queues, but nonetheless it's only a matter of time before I go back for some dirty BBQ loving. Would highly recommend - just have a plan for how you spend the wait time if you go in peak hours. I'd recommend timing things to fit with Barrio Central's Happy Hour, or stopping by the Dean Street Townhouse for a high class Bloody Mary.",

    "text": "Bodeans: Who knew there was a pork version of Nando's? This discreet little London bound chain needs taking nationwide. Pronto. Upstairs is a bench seating diner style for those quick stop pork pop in's, best for lunches. I did turn my nose up at the layout/decor as expected more from the outside as a pig shaped door knob greats you and entices you in. I was with a pro, there's a downstairs and we had booked. It was a Tuesday? Do you need to? Yes. Downstairs has a boutique kind of luxe New York vibe, complete with taxidermy heads and flat screens showing American sports (muted on non big game nights). Cocktails are lush, absolute must. Food. Let me just wipe dripping mouth. Delishhh pork in all forms and you can try them all with a combo meal. Pulled pork and burnt ends are all over the menu and with first taste its not hard to see why. Pure pork perfection. Ribs are meaty, dripping in sauce and plentiful. Steaks, sooo good but be warned medium rare always tends to be more on the rare side, which is fine because the plates are black, but I would keel over and die if they switched to white plates and blood became apparent. Service. Always friendly aka yank style. Love. Not many peeps know this BUT you can pre:order pulled pork, wings, ribs and steaks to take away and cook at home for your very own BBQ. This has to be done. You can also buy the sauces as well which aren't just bog standard BBQ shop brought shite. This is sooo reasonably priced and a must do for summer, just don't tell everyone.",

Still, service was very friendly, atmosphere is fun, and they had baseball playing the whole time! Great location, as well. Definitely go! Only down side - do NOT order the corn bread.

In saying that, at least \u00a0it gives me a sure fire destination for dinner whenever I'm in town. Nice relaxed place with communal tables and counter service. The babybacks are pretty darn good, and they do very decent burnt ends. Ribs come with fries and a side of slaw, and a full rack sets you up for the day without making you feeel the need to lie in the corner and sleep the pork off.If your an American then I guess you might feel a little short changed, this isn't in the same league as Redbones or Smoque, but for the UK, it's certainly the best your ever going to get this side of the pond!",

As an American, one of those foods that's usually hard to find besides good pizza, proper fried chicken, amongst them, BBQ is one thing I thought I'd never find in the UK. But then there's Bodeans. Upstairs is more of a quick eat set up or takeaway. Very relaxed yet quite busy. Downstairs is more restaurant style with table service. Both are casual. I've always gone for the Soho Special sandwich which is a combo of pulled pork and burnt ends \u00a0and it comes with coleslaw and french fries. I don't think I've ever left any on my plate (well except for the time I ordered the large by mistake instead of the regular \u00a0the large is way too much food). Downstairs in the restaurant area, you can also order cocktails which is great! Recommendations: Soho Special sandwich, bloody mary",

About that pig, you can get meat treats piled high. \u00a0I got the ol' standard pulled pork sandwich, and it does not disappoint. \u00a0The meat is tender and torn fine, barely a fatty bit in there, and although \u00a0I was slightly taken aback by the lack of sauce, I noticed the six pack of squeeze bottles loaded with bbq and chipotle sauce that I subsequently slathered my meat pile with. \u00a0 The \u00a0companion fries were nondescript but still just right.Something to consider.. the counter guy taking my order gave a cocky side look when I asked about getting the regular or large sized sammich.. \u00a0feeling my masculinity challenged I pounded the counter and trumpeted my acceptance, by gawd, for just 50p more! \u00a0But although you're supposed to get double the meat I didn't notice that much a difference from my friend's regular, and no matter what you choose you're going to be rolling out of there. \u00a0So maybe you want the Fat Tax, or not, it won't matter.I did notice that our third compatriot's full-rack of ribs looked a little tough to my eyes, as in, they didn't drip off the bones like I would prefer, but he seemed happy enough gnawing away. \u00a0The nice ladies checked by once or twice and let us know there's more of a sit down deal downstairs. \u00a0But that day we did lunch fast and cheap and it was a perfect tribute to BBQ back Stateside. \u00a0Yum.",
