Prices are a little bit steep, however you're definately paying for the expereince as well. We also found some discount vouchers through an online search, which eased the bill total slightly. Tasty food and a fun place to try. If you can't afford a trip to the US, Ed's will take you there in an instant!",

Decorated in the style of a 1950s diners Eds serves quality American fast food. My weakness has long been the peanut butter and banana shake, a smooth concoction of milk, peanuts sugar and pure joy. You probably wont even need to order a meal once you have ordered one of these beauties, as they are so thick and filling you will be undoing the top button of your jeans within a couple of slurps. If you don't get as excited about milkshakes as I do then try one of the many burger on offer, made with fresh ingredients and fries on the side you will be sure to be left stuffed, if not a little plumper. If your feeling extra hungry treat yourself to some cheesy fries, terribly synthetic but gorgeous to the taste buds. A meal for two with drinks should set you back no more then 20 pound.",

Chips are big but the ketchup is frankly weird and the mustard as timid as a virgin at a rodeo. Why not just go to burgerking? I'll tell you my friend. That's what that one would do. He'd go to burgerking. You are at Ed's so you can play Indian Love song on the jukebox and have a huge thick shake full of booze that will knock you on your btm for a month. Heart attack in a glass.

I went in for the first time this past Saturday as part of my American Independence celebration and will admit it did make me feel slightly closer to home, but at what cost? The beauty of American diners is that they're CHEAP! I know I can't expect the same deal abroad, but Ed's really is obscenely expensive for what you're getting. I paid about \u00a36 for a hot dog- plain, nothing else. A few more pounds for french fries, and a couple more on top of that for a coke. The tab added up very quickly. It was good, but it's a hot dog for crying out loud, it really doesn't take a genius to whip that up. I could've gone to Ikea and got a hot dog, french fries and a 'cola' drink for \u00a31.55. And they didn't have any pickle relish and in my book, a hot dog isn't a hot dog without pickle relish!I will say though, the service was excellent and I'm still giving them three stars because of it, and also because the food did taste good, just not THAT (\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3) good.",

On this occasion however the experience was appalling. We were rushed from the moment we stepped inside, pushed to place an order and when I asked for a refill of coffee, the manager gave me a very 'dirty' look! Instead of spending a nice relaxing time on a Friday evening, we felt like we were in Piccadilly circus station at rush hour shovelling some food into our mouths. So cutting a long story short, if you want to have an enjoyable and relaxing time do not go to Ed's Diner!!",

Surprisingly the food and milshakes are still pretty good it's just the d\u00e9cor and the awful staff that let this place down. They are rudeness personified. Ugly as well.

Thick and indecently bad for you, they are the perfect accompaniment to a cheeseburger and fries although likely to lead you to an early grave if you indulge too often. However, I agree with the other reviews that the staff here are terrible. When you imagine an American diner you expect that faux friendliness and 'have a nice day' chat. Ed's has none of this. The first time I visited this place I felt like I had to keep interrupting their own conversations to get any service. All in all I would describe Ed's as good for a filling meal but not a place I feel welcome to spend any length of time.

That coupled with the dukebox playing the best of the 50s and 60s (mostly rock and roll and the genre that would become known as motown) \u00a0from the States makes the atmosphere an upbeat and largely pleasant one.Most importantly, however, are the milkshakes. Not much to say other than go and have one. You can order these to take away, so no need to hang around.Not to mention free refills on soft fizzy drinks.Though the place is only small and a little cramped the general feel of Ed's Diner makes it an easy place to take the weight off of your feet and feel at ease. This is, however, a case of style over substance.Meh,Ian",

    "text": "Eds is a tiny 1950's American style diner with all the charm of \u00a0'Happy Days'. I go there for the novelty of all things rock 'n' roll and a proper hotdog with sweet fried onions.If you sit on a stool at the counter you're within reach of the mini jukeboxes and for a mere 20p you can listen to the likes of Buddy Holly and Smokey Robinson. It's not all novelty though as the food is just as great as the decor. My friends rave about the Malt Shakes in flavours like peanut butter, mint choc and coffee and banana, apparently they taste, \"just like a box of malteasers melted into ice cream\" which as tempting as it sounds, I haven't tried as they look more like a heart attack in a glass to me.It's a great place to come for a quick snack during the day with a couple of friends (It's not great for groups as it's so small). Afterwards I always feel like donning on a poodle skirt and going to a dance or a drive-in movie to look for my very own Richie Cunningham.",

This restaurant \u00a0while restaurant seems to be the wrong term actually \u00a0is very small. Very. Basically, you simple sit around the grill or kitchen at the centre. I went in, because it looked interesting, and I wanted to try Ed's anyway one time.The staff is funny, or weird. But not in a too bad way. But I can understand, that some people call them rude. Anyway, I cannot complain, they were not rude to me. But they were kind of rude to each other. But perhaps that's just normal for them, so I didn't really bother.The food is not really cheap. While the burgers are reasonably priced, in my opinion, the fries are not. So together it's not really that cheap. the good thing is, you can get a refill for your drink. If you want to. It's not the cleanest place too, but also okay in general.The quality of the food is average. I didn't expect too much, I did not get too much. It was okay. I would not go there, to get a really good burger. I might go there again, because it's a funny little place with these jukeboxes and the special (rude, weird, funny \u00a0kind of entertaining) staff.",

The good thing is that it is not cheap and tacky, and is more authentic than a lot of similar places I have been to.The best thing about it is that it serves the kind of food that you really crave sometimes, and can often be hard to find. The burgers are really satisfying after having a couple of beers. It is probably not a place to go out for diner, but it is a place that you would be happy to stumble across, or remember when you are in the area.The milkshakes look quite epic, I haven't tried one, but they look pretty special. There is a good old fashioned jukebox with old fashioned prices as well.",

The music was the same sort of 50's and 60's, I recall hearing a bit of Elvis as well as a bit of Billie Holiday. The downside is that the venue IS quite small, so I imagine when it's busy, it's pretty hard to move around =/ Now all 3 of us got milkshakes, not even knowing about their reputation for the good stuff. We each tried a bit of each others, one vanilla, one mint, and one banana; all three were amazing. The milkshakes set you back between \u00a33.65 and \u00a33.95 (depending on if you want their basics or something a little more fun), but bear in mind you get TWO glasses full of the heavenly stuff :) The only reason for me to give it 3 stars instead of 4 would be that the staff seemed a little rude to us when we came in, which is unfortunate considering all the other reviewers here found the staff friendly. Maybe next time they'll be a bit warmer :]",

The food is of high quality and you can watch the chefs cooking in the kitchen and keep an eye on what they're doing which gives the impression they have nothing to hide about the preparation of the meals! The prices are quite reasonable for somewhere in the centre of London as well. It's a great place for families as well as young people and the atmosphere in the evenings is often quite lively.",

There was no notice to say we couldn't purchase drinks without food anywhere in the diner, and it somehow spoilt all the good memories we had of other visitsSo if you are visiting London, remember if you want rude service and no apologies go to Eds or like us take your custom elsewhere We def won't be going back",

In the US, you won't find mid-grade restaurants or diners with fancy espresso machines. So the bottomless diner coffee was adorable and so fun. Same thing with bottomless sodas, and I liked that Ed's had fountain soda!Overall, the food was good for diner style food.

That being said...Go here and buy a milkshake!Like Rachel J, I am quite partial to the peanut butter shakes (although not quite as great as the Reece's shake at FatBurger or the PB&Choc shake at Pot Belly) but on my latest visit I deviated from the plan and ordered their new shake.A BISCOFF SHAKE!Made with malted milk biscuits, ice cream, and Biscoff spread. OH. MY. DAYS!Get there. Get there now, you won't be disappointed.",

The milkshakes vwere pretty good but the food was below average to compete in the London burger market.The deserts are straight out of a box, nothing authentic or endearing about it.Concepts and themes are great but you've got to get the food right too and for me they just aren't doing that.",

Ed's always serves pretty decent american fast food. go for the bonus program, we saved a lot of money so far! after a few visits you should have heard all of the 30 rock oldies they play in a loop, nice flair though.",

Shame this location is small. I would have enjoyed a booth. The food, well it wasn't diner american. The menu was limited. Either hotdogs or hamburgers. No diner in America would have that. It would be loaded with giant salads, and reubens. Isn't a diner without a reuben sandwich. And the pickles on the burgers weren't dill. Can't put a sweet pickle on a burger. It's a law! It was a nice atmosphere. The burgers weren't bad. Onion rings were good. Staff super awesome. Had myself a miller beer. Way!",

It can be expensive, but it's worth signing up for their loyalty card online where you can get a free burger/hot dog when you buy a drink- and being part of Ed's Club gets you a free milkshake in the time around your birthday- however they did kick me out of my seat when I tried to drink mine :(",

Check! American BBQ sauce? Double check! Chilli dogs? Hell Yeah! Milk shakes and root beer floats?? Thankfully Yes!I cannot begin to explain how rare it is to find a place that is all round American diner food, which in all fairness means it is the little things that matter. You should always look for BBQ sauce, chilli burger/hotdog combo, bacon, and heart stopping cheesecakes. This place has it all, including staff that will sing the blues to you like they are living off those tips (American style!). If you are American and miss home or simply someone craving some tasty treats, go here.What to expect: Classic burger \u00a35.75, Hot dog \u00a35.75, Chicken classic \u00a35.95, Sweet potato fries \u00a33.95, Shakes \u00a33.95, Root beer float \u00a33.25",
