Service, price (~ 3.50 for each person), everything was pretty much what I expected. \u00a0So, to be fair, 5 stars is largely because its the only shave ice place I've found. \u00a0If I dig up some more expect more reviewing.Dammit I wish I was in candy cafe right now.Update: Balls, I just went back to try the bubble tea and it was average at best. \u00a0Boba/tapioca were too soft and it was too heavy on the milk which overwhelmed the tea flavor. \u00a0Doesn't matter, 5 stars for the shave ice still stands.",

    "text": "I can only confirm what other more positive reviews have said about the variety and quality of the deserts served here. It is just fantastic.What I don't necessarily agree with is that the staff would be unfriendly. They may not smile but they are still very accommodating. Personally, I prefer to be treated nicely by somebody who isn't smiling than be treated rudely by somebody who is.And I found them generally very friendly. Aside from maybe when my friend and I wanted to pay separately and the guy just said: \"Well... here's the bill\". We obviously were supposed to divide it up in our heads ourselves. After we started to do that though, he did end up actually doing it for us... maybe we weren't fast enough, haha.One thing I did not appreciate though and I am subtracting a star for is both the general comfort of the place. I don't necessarily mind that it's really cramped but the minimalistic wood seating was a bit of a pain in the butt. Pun intended.Also, I don't think I've ever been to any place (restaurant, cafe, pub or otherwise) where people ate sitting down and they served EVERYTHING on plastic dishes (even the glasses were plastic). Although... I AM new to London and maybe that's something common at Asian places where they serve average priced food around here? Still, I found it a bit bizarre and this is more of a reason to subtract that star than the uncomfortable seating.",

    "text": "While searching around for bubble tea spots, I chanced upon Candy Cafe which not only serve bubble tea but Kaya toast too!I was understandably excited as there is nothing quite like having Kaya toast. It can be eaten anytime of the day, having it for breakfast with coffee or as afternoon tea or even for supper. Kaya is essentially a spread or jam that is made of eggs, sugar, coconut milk and pandan. It is decadently rich and aromatic with a slightly grainy texture. After watching a musical at the West End, I went with a couple of friends for some post theatre snack. For a cafe that is discreetly nestled between Rasa Sayang and Leongs Legend with only a tiny entrance signifying it's existence, there was quite a queue and we had to wait for about 20 minutes. The vibe was pretty much of a vibrant youth setting much like a student haunt with music videos being played on a tv in the background. \u00a0It seems like a perfect place as it offers snacks and drinks for those who are less peckish and slightly heavier meals for those who have not had anything to eat. Bubble tea was ordered by a number of us of course along with a Lychee Mint Tea and Strawberry Yogurt Tea. The bubble or pearls itself was good with a bouncy and glutinous chewy texture. The tea itself was a little lacking though, it was slightly too diluted and milky that you lose that richness in depth and aroma that tea brings into the equation. In comparison, Boba Jam is still the winner for me. The other two drinks were light, sweet sugary drinks that will appeal to those who like them like that. Kaya Toast (single \u00a31.35 double \u00a32.15)Kaya Peanut Butter Toast (single \u00a31.55 double \u00a32.35)A mixture of Kaya Toast were ordered by the table such that we have Kaya Toast on brown and white bread as well as a peanut butter and Kaya combo. My excitement quickly dissipated when it arrives and even furthermore after I took a bite. The toast itself was good, crunchy and toasty but the same can't be said of the Kaya filling, or should I say the lack of it. It was such a stingy serving of Kaya that you have to focus to taste it from the overwhelming abundance of bread. All I could eat and taste was bread. It was so disappointing, this isn't hard to make at all and they couldn't even get the proportion of Kaya and butter and toast right. A friend of mine ordered the spicy Nissin noodles which thankfully did not greet us with the same fate. It was decent and of the standard that you would expect from a snack cafe. Given the lack of options available when one craves some SE Asian desserts, Candy cafe will suffice and I'll be coming back to try other stuff, just not the Kaya Toast!",

    "text": "I think Candy cafe is probably one of the better bubble tea joints around and it's unpretentious for what it is. (Unlike Bubbleology!) and it has places to sit in to chat and drink whilst karaoke style music is played in the background. I like that about it, it's what it is and doesn't need PR to drum up hype. Regular customers already FLOCK. I have visited twice in the past week and whilst some drinks are pretty amazing, there are a few that I would never recommend unless you have a super sweet tooth, and greentea vanilla bubble tea is one of those. Just don't even touch it. Greentea lychee juice bubble tea drink though is pretty damn good. We also ordered a matcha milk with red beans instead of tapioca balls. Thats the wonderful thing about this joint, it allows you to change the 'edible additions' to the drinks. if you don't fancy bubbles, then try red beans or aloe vera jelly, or even grass jelly. The possibilities in creating a drink is ENDLESS. There is also free internet to check those all important \u00a0facebook messages..uh..i mean, emails!My only complaints are that sometimes i don't feel the staff are friendly enough. Service is alot to be desired and they could kick it up a notch.All in all though, I have recommended and will continue to in the future.",

Although it is table service, they can be a little slow to give you the bill at the end of your meal but will write it out immediately from memory if you go up to the counter. The crepes are excellent and I like their bubble teas, despite the fact that their tapioca pearls are slightly on the soft side, I'd prefer that to hard (old or undercooked).",

    "text": "Short version: Delicious bubble tea, alternative options to tapioca balls, few food options I have been looking for a quality bubble tea place in London for a while now and after reading a couple reviews on Yelp I thought I'd try this one out. I chose a simple milk tea and traded the tapioca balls for QQ jelly (a sweet slightly vanilla jelly). I was pleased that the waitstaff were polite and knowledgeable about their selections.It was a bit slow for my order to be taken, but once I had placed it the tea came quite quickly. Unfortunately, the food menu is limited to crepes and a few generic snacks (sausages, chicken wings, spring rolls). There were two toast options as well. I was hoping for something more substantial and took to the streets, finding a steamed bun stand just down the street with delicious pork buns. Would have loved to have it at Candy Cafe but this still worked out.Another key selling point - free wifi but you need the password from the waitstaff which will be given only after you order.Note: the sign/entrance is literally just a doorway so keep a sharp eye out or you will miss it",

Congealed pig's blood, silkworm larvae, turtle flipper, deep-fried scorpion: I ate 'em all. \u00a0It wasn't pleasant.They make nice stuff too though. \u00a0Like puddings. \u00a0Most people don't really think of China as being the place for puddings, but then most people are usually wrong. \u00a0Which is good because it means that places like Candy Cafe remain unpatronised by anyone other than those in the know. \u00a0Like me, baby. \u00a0I'm in the know.To be fair, Chinese puddings are still a bit weird, depending on your perspective, but when your perspective is from a fish's eyeball (having just eaten it), they're marvellous. \u00a0My favourite used to be sticky rice flour balls filled with chopped peanuts or sesame seed paste in sweet milky water. \u00a0They're so doughy that it is a bit like having a mouthful of wallpaper paste, but sweet wallpaper paste, and in a good way. \u00a0I'd not eaten it for eight years - eight years! - but Candy Cafe had it on the menu, and my god with the first tooth-gluing bite it was like I'd been transported back across the continents and the better part of a decade and there I was in Jiangmen in my old pudding cafe, sealing my mouth together with peanut sticky rice balls, sweating in the sub-tropical heat, dreading my afternoon classes, swatting away mosquitoes, counting cockroaches. \u00a0Ah, memories.The nostalgia continued with the milk/bubble/boba tea, which - having selected the original Taiwanese version - is by far the most authentic I've had in London (Bubbleology comes a relatively close second). \u00a0The whole faithful experience was topped off by a laminated menu in Chinese with poorly-translated English, weird photos, and a surly waitress who wouldn't let two of us share a single dish and demanded that we each order at least one item lest we be bodily thrown from the premises (slight exaggeration; same outcome).I don't care about the grumpiness or the rules which inevitably make no logical sense. \u00a0That's what makes it so real. \u00a0I'm scared of Chinese restaurants with friendly waitresses who speak perfect English - that's just not the Middle Kingdom I know and love. \u00a0Candy Cafe takes me back, with its cramped tables, suspect stains, noisy kitchen and narrow staircase. \u00a0It probably won't be the destination of choice for those who haven't lived in Asia, but if you have, and fancy a taste of the old life, this is the place to go for a sugar hit and heady thump of nostalgia . . . be it painful or otherwise.",

    "text": "This place is a lovely hidden gem but almost impossible to find it which makes it very hard to direct people there. I been to this place quite a lot and I can confirm what others have said so far: the portions are massive, the quality is very good, the menu has a lot of variety, the staff is very friendly & fast, the tea is very good and they stay open until late. On a cold day I would recommend trying the dessert soups or crepes and on a hot day it's always interesting to experiment with their cold dessert selection.The only reason I am giving it 4 starts is because of the tiny toilet/staircase and the crammed space inside the store but even this can make for an interesting experienceOn a final note, they also do takeaway on everything which i found a bit odd but they do package things neatly and they are easy to carry without worrying if you will spill them or if they will melt.",

The booths only fit around 4-6 people if you squeeze in though. Their desserts also remind me of home which is always a welcome feeling.",

    "text": "Thank you, Candy Cafe, for alleviating my Tapioca/Bubble Tea withdrawal! Having read the reviews on this place, I was eager to go to Chinatown and judge for myself whether this place's tapioca drinks come anywhere close to the ones I've been used to consummate in San Francisco (yes, I am aware of the meaning of consummate...exactly!) And my verdict is: yes, the drinks are actually very tasty indeed...even though I wished the selection was a little bigger.Apparently, this place started off as hang-out place for the workers in Chinatown. Back then the menu was only in Chinese and so only few other people would come here. But according to the legend the reputation of their drinks eventually motivated the owner to translate the menu and thus attracted more customers...like myself and the other Yelpers who reviewed this business before me.As for the interior, it's quite plain but very authentic in that it doesn't try to be a \"typical\" Chinese restaurant with gaudy decoration to lure in tourists. Even though it's a rather tiny place, there are a few tables where you can surf the Internet (free wifi) while enjoying a drink or any if the other deliciuosly-looking desserts. \u00a0The clientele is also very non-touristy, thank goodness! I would assume that that has to do with the fact that Tapioca drinks are not very well-known to the average tourist. In fact, I still very much remember the quizzical expression on the faces of my friends, back in San Francisco, when I first introduced them to the art and philosophy of enjoying a Bubble Drink (and not choking, mind you!).",

    "text": "I'm quite surprised a lot of yelpers have heard of this place. When it first opened up we thought, what a strange place to have a Chinese dessert place! You have to go to the first floor to eat? The door to this place is a very small door with orange sign? How do people find this place?Well. I found it because Chinese people, being Chinese people, always spread news of openings like wildfire. It was, and still is, a haunt for many university students and sometimes older people like me!The desserts are ok, they had some teething troubles back when they were newly opened because when my group of 10 came, one of my friends discovered her dessert was salty. You read that right, salty. We told the manager and he was puzzled and we asked him to try it. Yes, it tasted salty to him too! He then proceeded to take another 2 of the same dessert out of the fridge and tried them, they were salty too! Promptly the whole lot went into the bin and my friend ordered something else. Strange experience, but perhaps someone mixed up the sugar and salt containers? Even if a dessert went off it would not become salty, unless my mind is not as scientific as I thought.Luckily, I have been back a few times over the years and the same experience has not happened again.The issue I have with this place is the space. There is so little room here and you will usually feel cramped in your little seating area, and it's not very good if you want an impromptu catch up with a huge group of friends, as usually it's really busy at night. There is one toilet only, sometimes they keep it locked and you have to ask for the key, sometimes it's open. Just ask the staff, they are quite friendly.For me though, I still prefer my original dessert haunt, Golden Gate dessert house, unless my companions feel like eating here. I feel like the desserts are more freshly made there than here, and the turnaround of the food is better. There is also more space there. Each to their own though, don't judge until you have tried both.",

The Malaysian coffee is also something the curious ones should try, preferably with Japanese style crepes (don't expect a \"wow\" here, those are just classic thin crepes). Something I've never tried (honestly never had the courage of ordering) is the signature herbal jelly. It looks kind of weird type of desert..., dark coloured jelly, made out of herbs? Not really sure about this, but would try it if my curiosity takes over. Others say there're a few meals options but I haven't tried anything except crepes, so can't comment on this.To summarise it all - good location, quick service and rather good bubble tea.",

    "text": "My cousin and I were craving some traditional Malaysian kaya toast, so we stopped by Candy Caf\u00e9 for afternoon desserts.It was quite empty as we were the only customers apart from another table of 4, however it would be expected for 3pm on a Friday.The kaya toast was good, although a little pricy considering the amount of kaya jam served. We also ordered the sweet red bean soup, a herbal grass jelly, and a kumquat tea. All were very nice and came quickly. The red bean soup was very milky and the amount of pearls and red bean to soup was perfect. The grass jelly came in a generous portion and was served with sweet syrup to flavour the jelly. The kumquat tea was hot and soothing for the chilly October weather.The atmosphere was nice with Chinese MTV playing on a television screen. The decor was okay; just simple wooden chairs and tables, which was good for casual dates and outings.Overall, I enjoyed the food and drink, and the atmosphere was very homely and easygoing. I'd recommend the kaya toast for anyone who hasn't tried it (still doesn't beat the real Malaysian thing, but it's the best you'll get in London!)",

    "text": "This is a small cafe in the middle of Chinatown which is upstairs, so it's a bit hard to find. You have to look for the sign advertising their shop in front of the stairs which lead to their store. They have plenty of seating, which is good, especially if you want to try their desserts.I had the crystal snow with condensed milk, peaches, and ai-yu jelly. My friend had the watermelon smoothie with ice cream. I was expecting my dessert to be more like shaved ice, but it was very very soft and different from shaved ice. It was almost like melty ice cream, since the condensed milk made it creamy. However, it melted away after 5 minutes, which is way shorter than any cold dessert should last. My friend loved the watermelon smoothie, however.We also ordered bubble tea to go. They have lots of customisability and also suggest to mix flavours. The bubble tea wasn't the best I've had, so I would rate this place as just mediocre for bubble tea and their desserts.",

Would really wish there were more of these kind of cafes in central London.Candy cafe can be easily missed, as most have mentioned here, because the restaurant is on the first floor. The restaurant itself is quite nice and friendly looking, certainly welcoming.There is a huge variety of bubble tea, and all sorts of chinese deserts. There is also some snack foods like wings, instant noodles and toasts and the prices are quite decent too.I tried some of the house deserts, it was certainly refreshing and the service is quite quick. It does get busy here, but it just shows that this is a popular bubble tea / cafe hang out. There is free WiFi and they offer student discount and accept card.I would come here again, its different and serves a good variety of bubble tea and chinese deserts.",

Not sure how they failed to make it, the ice felt like it was scraped from the bottom of a fridge. It was chunky and not refreshing at all, it was more like ice you have in drinks rather than snow. The bubble tea was also bad, they didn't use ice cubes but instead the shaved ice ice. This made it impossible to suck up the bubbles because the ice was too chunky.The cafe it self was nasty, it was not like a cute little cafe you are used to when it comes to bubble tea, it was more like a generic dirty china restaurant in Chinatown.I do not recommend it to you who are a person that loves Asian dessert and eat it often.",

This place seems to be popular with a lot of college students (maybe because they give student discounts and some other discount- can't remember). We went late at night after dinner as dessert for their shaved ice and some boba. Both were so-so, the shaved ice wasn't authentic shaved ice, but like snow cone shaved ice and not the fresh shaven ice you get in hong kong that is like powered snow. The boba was so-so also, chatime down the street was better. The prices were cheap though. Overall, the items we tried were so-so but cheap so i guess you get what you pay for. Oh, the people working their didnt speak mandarin chinese I think (the guy working their asked me to speak english). Maybe because he was from taiwan or spoke canto? idk lol.",
