No, we didn't get a smorgasbord of culinary perfection for \u00a34.50 a head. Prices have undoubtedly crept up (and who could blame them, with the constant stream of Guardian-reading, city-type customers who wouldn't normally dream of visiting Stockwell). The decor is a bit more refined now too. But we did get friendly service, amusing banter with the owner and, above all, excellent Indian food. We took their advice and went off-menu, receiving a selection of starters and main courses with rice and naan. Each dish tasted really good and great choice for vegetarians too. All freshly cooked, no dodgy colouring or layers of grease. For the four of us, the bill came to \u00a355 which isn't bad at all. We'll be going back.",

(amazing what you can do on photoshop) The furniture is plastic and the space is incredibly small will about 10 tables - so book ahead. Often, half the space is booked for one party so it will be loud. Best bit - Bring your own Booze policy. All the Charm is the owner. (light brown eyes- you will see what I mean when you meet him) Don't look at the menu as it is filled with a few of the obvious things but most names you will not know. Just have the owner bring you his favorite of the day and you will be hooked. Whats more, you have to order the ridicules huge circular bread 'nan' thing - it's larger than the table. dooh!!! you will love this place",

You know when you normally go for a curry and they bring you a weighty tome of a menu full of stuff you don't understand so you just order a chicken korma? Well there's none of that at Hot Stuff. They just bring you everything and then charge you between \u00a310 and \u00a315 a head for it. And it's amazing. Just how curry should be. Ian Wright is often there at weekends picking up his takeaway. You'll be hard pushed to find better value and better food in London. Book ahead. They're always rammed. And rightfully so.",

The intimacy of the place means that all the attention is on the guests and the chef has time to make each dish with perfection! Its bring your own booze and the waiters will even keep it in the fridge for you and top up your wine when its running low, very over the top considering my bottle was \u00a33 from Tesco's but I'm not complaining! The place is covered in little chilli's, a warning that the food is spicy but delicious, the king prawns were divine! The poppadoms were delicious!

    "text": "I've eaten here many times. The food has been good (given the price) every time. It's a small restaurant and the tables are packed up quite closely. Because it's BYO it can get quite rowdy, especially on weekends - that makes for a great atmosphere if you're drinking too. The booze shop next door is quite expensive but the only option if you want chilled beer. If you're after red wine then you're better off popping across Wandsworth Road to the big Sainsburys. Prices are variable - I'm sometimes charged different prices when ordering the same thing over multiple visits - not sure if this is because of the chaotic kitchen or taking advantage of drunk patrons! Many people opt for letting them choose the meal which makes it very difficult to know what the final price will be. But generally it's about \u00a315/head. They don't provide receipts - just tell you the final bill. Sometimes they offer a discount for cash. They do takeaway food too. Worth noting that there's another BYO restaurant in the area - Bonnington Square cafe (vegetarian). Finding it - either walk down South Lambeth Road until you find Lambeth Library (opposite the Portuguese Estrala restaurant) - walk down the path on the side of the library - about 150m along the path it turns into Wilcox Road and the restaurant is on the right hand side. Or walk down Wandsworth Road til you find the big Sainsburys - Wilcox Rd is just a bit further south from the petrol station (on opposite side of street).",

So far in London, I have found the best Indian eateries around the Indian communities of west London (Hounslow) or south London (Tooting), where you can get some particular spectacular south Indian food.The service was slow - it was a Friday night, so perhaps this was understandable, however the staff was friendly, particular a gentleman who I think is the manager. One thing to note is that there is no bill given, it seems you are just given a total. I think they should at least offer the option of a bill. In summary, I would recommend visiting as it is a good value Indian eatery, and the food was all in all, good.",

We hadn't booked but were given a table near the front counter which is where a lot of people come and stand around to pick up takeaways, so be sure to book. They offer two different ways to order. One off their menu and the other they bring you a selection of starters, mains and sides. All you do is tell them if you have an allergies or something in particular you don't like and they will make sure to cater for you. You still get charged whatever each item is on the bill but the benefit is that you get unlimited naan, saying that you'll only need one after the amount of food you are given, so it could be best just to order exactly what you want. Every dish was great, not over powering in spice and very balanced. I really enjoyed the butternut squash and spinach side. The menu is very reasonably priced and for two it only came up to \u00a332.

    "text": "I hate to be a Negative Nancy but I was not impressed with our final meal in London on my first Europe trip. Despite all of the great reviews on Yelp, the dishes left much to be desired. First of all, it is kind of in the middle of nowhere - expect to walk for a bit after getting off the tube and then walking around amongst a residential area. Also, there are 2 locations on the same street! They do the menu for a large group of people where they will just bring out a few of their popular dishes and that's great, but... I just found the food to be a bit bland. Then again, I love spicy food and there are about 10 Indian restaurants within a square mile of where I live (San Francisco/Berkeley) so perhaps it would be spicy and flavorful for people less familiar and accustomed to the cuisine.+1 for the cleanliness and decor - I love the chili decor (if I remember correctly) +1 for their large portions (even by American standards, we had leftovers!) +1 for the milk tea!",

The guys who run Hot Stuff are extremely friendly and welcoming, and made sure to make me feel appreciated as a new customer.We had take-away and the food was top quality, tasted slightly home made and not at all like the identical flavours you get from generic curry houses all over London. Despite this, it was also super cheap. Will be back to dine in next time!",

    "text": "Hot Stuff used to be owned by a Indian family of West African extraction (or West African of Indian extraction? Apologies for my appalling lack of historical knowledge) who specialised in cooking up a feast and bringing you a wide selection of their recommended dishes. \u00a0No need to make a decision; they'll do it for you. \u00a0This was back in the day when the restaurant was housed in a ridiculously tiny hole in the wall that could handle all of about 20 covers, with steamed-up windows, plastic chillies hanging from the ceiling and canteen-style furniture. It looked like a total dive. \u00a0To all intents and purposes, it was. \u00a0And yet the food they produced was second-to-none; lipsmackingly delicious dishes, Indian home-cooking at its finest, naan bread the size of a table and so much food that even at the end of the meal, the offerings had barely been dented.Not surprisingly, they've since expanded. \u00a0The original hole is still there, but they now own the spot two doors down and its purple frontage makes for an altogether smarter-looking joint. \u00a0Still, you can't get away from the fact that it's housed in an industrially grey Vauxhall backstreet, and it's BYOB (there's an offie helpfully located right next door) which is purse-friendly but doesn't exactly raise the class factor. \u00a0I don't know if the original family are still in charge but the ordering policies have now become more formal, if with the same end result; they do an option which is \u00a315 per head and provides you with a variety of curries to share, poppodoms and the aforementioned gigantic naan.This isn't gourmet dining. \u00a0The staff are brilliantly friendly and cheerful but it's hardly silver service. \u00a0But the dishes are wonderful, comforting, warming and fragrant, the portions huge (doggy bags are available) and the new premises allow room to breathe. \u00a0It's not quite as special as it was before, and I do think that they have lost some of the intimacy and family-run atmosphere which used to prevail, but it hasn't negatively impacted on the food at all and it's still my go-to Indian restaurant in London.Book ahead. \u00a0It may be in Vauxhall but it's more popular than Brick Lane.",

The starters of meat samosas and something else which was like potato balls were delicious. The chicken biryani was good (not amazing though, for truly incredible biryani the best I've had in the Uk has been at Amaya). The dansak curry was of good quality and not oily. The naan bread impressed me most (although if you get a chilli one prepare for a hot mouth). What I love most about this place is its laid back style, you can bring your own drinks and the waiter we had was so friendly and approachable. Do not go here if you want a quiet romantic evening. The ambience is a little frenetic. I will definitely go back, it's not the best Indian I've had, but for the value and convenience it's great.",

And when I say it's a hole in the wall type, I mean that with the upmost respect. I had the mixed vegetables with savory rice, I also asked them to make it spicy. Holy cow! Hands down the best Indian food I've ever had jn my life. I'm from Cali and our Indian there in no way held up to what this place had to offer. The owner was super friendly and they even gave you some pickled sauces for an appetizer. I only wish I came with an appetite because I left back to our loft wishing how much I should've tried their other vegetarian items. I read somewhere that they're closing next year. I hope that's not the case because I definitely want to go back. If you're coming from the states, do yourself a favor and go there!",

    "text": "This is our third Indian restaurant in London in the past four days, and I chose it based on the outstanding Yelp reviews. The food was decent, but the service and neighborhood were not the best. After a mile plus walk and experiencing it firsthand, it was definitely my least favorite of the three, and falls way below compared to our favorite. With so many other great Indian options around, I'm not sure why this one is so popular.Neighborhood: On a Sunday evening, the street was mostly deserted with other businesses closed up. There were people milling on the street who didn't make it feel like the safest place. I imagine it is different at lunch time or during the week.Food: We felt pressured from the start to let them pick our food. I knew from the reviews this was a regular thing, but the way the waiter did it in a way that made us feel like we shouldn't order from the menu. With a mix of vegetarians and meat eaters in our group, we figured that was not the best approach. We ended up with a ton of food anyway, and it was all fairly standard taste-wise. Good, but not worth an extra mile of walking. Portions were on the small size.Service: We were seated promptly without a reservation. The restaurant was empty at 6:30 other than one couple when we got there, but busy when we left. Waiter was quick to take our order, and food came fairly quickly. However it was frustrating getting more water, extra rice, and our appetizer/first round dishes cleared.Last but not least, we were not given an itemized bill but just told the amount. When I offered my credit card, he said the machine was broken and that I needed cash. Not too happy about that.",

If you are a connoisseur, you know that your meal is a dance and at any moment it can become a train wreck if you're not careful. What the hell am I talking about? Well, to eat Indian food is a seductive process whereby you are romanced by spice and slowly cooked ingredients yet frankly, I didn't feel much more seduced than being approached by a toothless streetwalker in the daytime offering a BJ for 20 quid.All in all, if you were so hard up for Indian food and were in the neighborhood, I would say that this is you best option, although you could probably still have Holy Cow delivered from Battersea Park Rd too, and they're definitely a world apart; the type of seduction taught in the Karma Sutra!The staff is very nice, courteous, and helpful.

    "text": "Super friendly waiter, small restaurant and difficult to get to (nearest tube stop is vauxhall).Ordered:Chicken tikka masala - yum!!pashwari naan - delicious but not as sweet or filled as other pashwari naan i've had. i still love it though. Good for those of you who like sultanas and coconut. mango lassi - a really small glass... a little watery. rice - standardmeat samosas - delicious (i split it with a friend)parathas (free! with four dips!) - same as any other restaurantAll of the above for 13.20. i had SO MUCH food it was ridiculous.And the waiter was ridiculously nice and gave us otter pops (or whatever the uk equivalent is) at the end. He's also happy to give suggestions if you dont' know what to order! I recommend booking a table ahead of time, as the place is small and fills up quickly.Great service, great food, great prices, but a difficult location to reach!",

    "text": "American here. I haven't had Indian food in London in ages (yeah, I haven't been here since the Concord was in service). We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, Aloo Gobi and Veggie Samosa. The main dishes had a the perfect amount of heat. The chicken was white meat, and very tender. The Aloo Gobi was well seasoned.\u00a3-to-portion-to-quality ratio was actually must better than I can get in the states.Don't forget - BYOB - but there is place next door where you can pick up festive beverage.",

    "text": "We were visiting London and staying in Vauxhall but wanted Indian food so we walked to this place. It's located in a strange street with some other restaurants and car shops. We were pleasantly surprised by the place. Others complained about service but we found it good. The different courses were delivered in a timely manner and quite tasty. One thing I would recommend, at the time they were offering to pick your courses for you and that is awesome. Stop off next door to get wine or beer and then just let them decide what you will eat.",

    "text": "This place offers affordable, delicious Indian food with a definite kick of spice and heat if you so seek it!Went to dinner with some friends visiting and who wanted to try the great Indian food that is offered in London. We were not disappointed. The food is really tasteful, plentiful and filling.The meat samosas were absolutely fantastic-- really crunchy pastry and filling nicely complemented by sweet Tamarind sauce.Also, these guys are totally flexible to combining plates upon special requests. My husband was able to get Prawn curry with pieces of Lamb.Staff is super friendly and accommodating as well.Finally, although they may not advertise-- they actually allow BYOB!Highly recommend making it over to get your Hot Stuff on.",
