They don't advertise it very well and we had to ask the waitress, who then went to ask her manager, but there was no problem and it saved us money on an already reasonable meal. I was also very impressed with the d\u00e9cor- it did not look like a chain restaurant, but was romantic and cosy with Italian music and candles in wine bottle on every table,which I thought was a nice touch.",

A perfect starter for sharing is a platter of Italian meats, buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, roasted peppers, assorted olives, and artichokes with toasted ciabatta. They have some unusual pasta options, such as penne with duck sauteed with spring onions and sliced mushrooms in plum sauce and penne sauteed with goat cheese, cherry tomatoes, fresh spinach, and olive oil and sprinkled with toasted pine nuts. Chicken breast stuffed with mozzarella cheese is baked in a tomato sauce with smoked bacon, onions, and mushrooms and served with roast vegetables and new potatoes.This is one of many locations in the city and a good one if you're going to a performance at one of the nearby theatres or a film at the adjacent Odeon Leicester Square.",

But despite that fact, I think very highly of them and their restaurants tend to be extremely good. I only had one bad experience here one night when it was busy and we were sat right by the bar (well not really a bar, but where they make the drinks) and we got awful service all night long, and I seem to recall a problem with my order. But I'm willing to forgive. I'm good like that. Because generally, this place is great right from the word Bruschetta or Ciabatta. Mmmmmmm, I'm hungry. Maybe I should stop reviewing and go grab an Italian. Anyways, where was I? Oh yeah. My review. This place is great!. I don't imagine Italian food to be too hard to get right, I mean, even I can make pasta. But these guys are good - and the restaurant has a lovely warm vibe to it, pleasant staff - and the clientele are usually void of morons, except of course when I visit. Also, I figure, if you sit by the window - you should be able to get a really good view of the Film Premieres; so you'll be able to look down on all the crazy people throwing themselves at Johnny Depp or whoever.",

You know, this reaction in the face, \u00a0making people feeling welcome.

    "text": "As far as Italian restaurant chains go, Bella Italia is one of the better ones in London. They are ubiquitous in Zone 1, with at least 4 locations within a walking distance of Piccadilly Circus.Bella Italia serves a decent full range of Italian dishes. I haven't tried the pizzas very frequently, but whenever i have, i have not been disappointed. My usual order is an antipasti for starter (which comes with some delicious mozzarella) or a plate of calamari. I really like the squid here ... quite soft.For my main course i usually select a pasta. I have had quite a few different ones, from penne, arabiata to the traditional spaghetti ... and bella italia always makes them well. Earlier they didn't have many risottos in their menu, but now they do ... so i have recently started ordering chicken risottos here.Although they serve pretty decent food, i have some issues with their service level. Once i needed to take a dish back, and they refused. The reason ostensibly was that they do not have disposable containers. Thats a pretty poor excuse if you ask me. The service can be atrociously slow at times. I have missed several minutes of a movie because they had made us wait for an inordinately long time at each stage ... seating, order, serving and getting the cheque.On the whole its a very nice chain to come to for cheap Italian meals (usually less than \u00a315 per head) during an evening out ... but i wouldn't recommend it for special occasions or if you are in a hurry.",

Continuing on to the pasta; it was delicious and quite rich in flavour actually.

Conveniently located in Leicester Square and \"Theatreland\", right around the corner from the Underground, and a couple blocks from Trafalgar Square. During the 10 days we were in London, we ate at Bella Italia about four times. We mostly ate their spaghetti bolognese and pasta carbonara, which were excellent and tasted authentic. We also tried their pizza and loved that as well, but not as much as the pasta! The price was steep - we paid an average of $75 every time we ate there but it was well worth it, especially after eating the bland food found in most British restaurants and pubs. We sat outside every time we ate here, which provided a very European atmosphere and great people-watching. The staff was very friendly each time. On one of the nights we ate here, I noticed a world map with pins stuck in it on a wall inside, next to their bar area. I asked if the pins indicated where their customers were from and the waitress said yes and asked where we were from. I said Los Angeles and she excitedly (and shockingly) said they didn't have a pin in Los Angeles yet. So I got to put a pin in for L.A. and the staff gave me a free gelato for it!Eating here is one of my favorite memories of my trip to London. I'll definitely return to eat here on my next trip.",

The calamari was appropriately crisp, with a tang of lemon, the marinara on the side was delightful. The seabass with side of veggies was a nice meal that left me satisfied without being overwhelmed. I would recommend for food and service quality.",

Even better, the restaurant is open late, which is always handy if you've caught a show and looking around for somewhere which isn't already packed full.

The pasta is made with egg yolk noodles which do not go well with marinara sauce. I'd stick to the pubs and fish and chips during a trip to London. By war worst Italian food I've ever had. There were 5 of us that had different meals, in hopes that Italian food is hard to mess up and everyone did not like their meals. This place made Olive Garden look like a 5 star restaurant.",

The quality of the food is really good, and the atmosphere is lovely and relaxing with lots of candles dripping in wine bottles.

The staff were very friendly, our food was prompt so no complaints there. I love the decor inside, there are some old posters that add charm to the atmosphere. Its a great place to come with a large group of people, in terms of ambiance and location, while the pizzas make for excellent sharing.",

Their gluten free menu was fairly extensive and offered a variety of options including pizza, and they even made me gluten free garlic bread one night! \u00a0The prices are extremely reasonable, and when you think about the quality of food you're getting, I think it's actually quite the deal. \u00a0Next time i'm in London, I know Bella Italia will be visited, and it's definitely an aspect of my trip that sticks out the most!",

Not a place to go if you want a quiet meal; calling the pace 'bustling' would be an understatement. The staff are very friendly and have to run around like hell. We had to wait a while, but not too long. Enjoyed a very pleasant creamy mushroom dish, followed by penne pasta with duck: a first for me. Incredibly rich and amusingly as if Leicester Square Italia meets its adjoining Chinatown. That lead to my only complaint - no grappa!!

Bella Italia was one of my favourite chains when I lived in Norwich but I had not had the chance to go to one in London even if they are all over the place.I found the chance to visit it now however as I redeemed some Tesco points for meal vouchers there. The restaurant was a bit busy but we were given our menus and first drinks quickly, then left to look at the menu in detail. I went for a stew type dish while my boyfriend got a pizza and we also shared the whitebait starter. The dessert was very nice too but it took a while between for bushing our main and them coming and taking the next order so we had to finish in a hurry to go to the theatre.While I did enjoy all the food I think it was pretty standardised. It's tasty and filling but can be found in most places. If you are in the area and have dinner there you will not be disappointed but it's not really a must visit restaurant for me. At least not in London where there are so many alternatives when it comes to Italian food.",

The lavatory is so small that I had my knees against the wall wile sitting down... wowI want to talk about the dish itself.

Was very cozy and the food was good (loved the olive plate yumm!) our waitress who was Lithuanian was very pleasant and accommodating, loved her! Food wasn't phenomenal but was good enough. Their coffee was awesome but the tequila shots must of been tequila flavored water, that part was disappointing (no buzz lol) but overall decent experience.",

    "text": "Great food at reasonable prices, what's not to like? \u00a0As well as traditional Italian food for lunch or dinner they do breakfast and as a bonus they have unlimited hot drinks with any breakfast purchase (although I could only manage two). \u00a0They also offer set lunch and dinner deals and there are always bonuses to be had every week with the various offers they have on their site.Service is friendly, sometimes could be a be more attentive but not bad. \u00a0The food is well presented and full of flavour and it's well located to Leicester Square. \u00a0There are plenty of tables inside with another floor below and some tables outside so it's not difficult to get a table here if you are looking for a quick bite to eat.",

    "text": "I came here with 4 others on a Saturday evening and was seated promptly, though it was very busy. Manny, the waiter, made our experience a great one. He was professional, prompt, knowledgable and very welcoming. I can't say the same thing about the hostess that sat us. She was short, brief and was not accommodating when we asked her for a booth. The warm garlic bread that we had as an appetizer was absolutely delicious. I wish I could bottle the sauce that it came with and take it home with me. The bruschetta was just OK because it came on very large pieces of bread that made it difficult to share and that got soggy pretty quickly. My pesto chicken pasta was amazing. The portion was pretty generous so I was stuffed by the time that I left. It's obvious that whoever owns this place is Italian because the food is very athletic and very delicious. The prices are moderate and once again, we were very happy with the service so I definitely recommend this place.",
