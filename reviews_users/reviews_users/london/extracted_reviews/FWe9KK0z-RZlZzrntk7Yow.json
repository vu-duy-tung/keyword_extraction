    "text": "Enjoyed the tasting menu with the wine pairings. This was an absolutely lovely meal. Almost everything was delicious.Only two problems: firstly, this is more of a seafood restaurant. The seafood dishes were amazing. However, both red meat dishes left alot to be desired. The beef and the venison were not good. In fact we could not eat them!Secondly, the tables are placed too close to one another. Quite uncomfortable.Service was good, maybe a bit too personable!All in all, a great dinner. The food being the best part. The 3 stars are for the food alone, not the rest of the experience. That could be improved.The gimmicky key you get at the start to claim a tiny muffin and a teabag at the end, means you end up with something to carry for the rest of the night! And nowhere near as delightful as Marcus Wareings' gorgeous chocolate truffles! So well done, but could do better!",

    "text": "Someone much funnier than me described the current phenomena of small plate dining as \"50% of the food for 75% of the cost\". I see a more worrying trend... The revival of nouvelle cuisine. Think about it. Austerity budget, mass unrest in Egypt, rising unemployment, strikes, riots and a royal wedding. We're back in 1981. With iPhones.The menu at Pollen Street Social makes the point heavily. A full two pages of small plates (or starters as I uncoothly call them) followed by 5 or 6 large dishes (or mains, keeping up?). We were told that it was entirely up to us, we could create our own menu. Maybe to go with 3-4 plates to begin, then to either take a main, or a few more small plates, or leave it there should you so wish and have a dessert or two instead. At least so decreed the man in the kitchen in the pre launch PR, but this insouciant attitude doesn't translate to the insistent restaurant staff and anyway, I really can't see anyone going to the bother of getting a table here only to pop in for a light snack. Except maybe the models flocking on the arms of their Mayfair monied rich boys, fairly joyless, overly gussied up rich people who don't really want to eat.And that brings me, finally, onto the food. A few notable exceptions aside, it was sadly also fairly joyless, overly gussied up, rich and model thin. I wanted so much to like it, but just couldn't find enough to praise. Reading some of the critics and other bloggers who have been already I may be in a minority of one, but while they're preparing the way for the pitter patter of tiny Michelin stars, I spend my life entertaining at these joints, hence the need to know the latest places and I really know what I love, and don't love, about restaurants.With the air-con off and a hotter than average London early evening outside, we went for some of the lighter plates. Despite being designed for sharing, they're not all designed to share. Fowey Oysters, hot and cold gave us only 2 crustacea, one submerged in a dashi broth, the other blended with eel and reformed as sorbet. An interesting concept, but the lukewarm mushroomy broth took more than it gave the oyster and the sorbet was a small scoop of non event, a slight and subtle briny tone overwritten by the eel. A single scallop, again with the sharing plate!, came with two denuded Jersey royals, their royal skin flayed, crisped and presented on top. The cabbage pesto alongside was interesting, big and bright. The scallop sadly was rubbery and overcooked. Crab salad was bright, sparky and everything a small portion of fresh shredded pearly white meat should be, the thinest slices of pickled daikon (a Japanese radish) gave it crunch and the look of a deconstructed Chinese dumpling and the quality of the meat shone through. The almond and crab sorbet accompanying it was a ferocious own goal, I left most of mine.The low point came with a miserly pair of emaciated red prawns, sat in a bamboo steamer on a bed of seaweed. a teapot of consomme was poured through the slats of the steamer, the 'reveal' coming after we'd eaten the two prawns - a pair of dumplings sat underneath in the rapidly chilling 'tea'. blitzed fish in odour, scrambled egg in texture, nothing to tell of in taste.The kitchen almost, almost redeemed itself with the final two dishes. The only two I would go back for from the menu we sampled, a simple onglet steak with a tiny cube of dauphinoise and a platter of smoked foie gras on thin slices of preserved apple with a raisin 'jam'. Perfectly sourced, perfectly cooked and near as damn it faultless. This was the meal I was looking for from Jason Atherton. It was clever without feeling the need to shout about it, still clearly containing the perfectionist elements and subtle twists, but these supported, surrounded and shouted the quality ingredients that deserved to be centre place, and that we should have been there to enjoy.",

We arrived early, as they were just opening, so they were not quite ready but they made us welcome just the same and we sat in the bar area for a few minutes. Modern, nicely spaced tables, but every surface hard. A good range of choice on the lunch special. When it came it was simply outstanding, and very much enjoyed. Reasonable sized portions, and yes the pud was even more outstanding. The lady sommelier was freindly knowledgable and helpful, so we did well there too. But the noise. worse than school dinners. We had to shout at each other at the end. At this level of quality I don't need buzz, the food supplies it. Jason the chef was at the exit and was a delight to meet & talk to. There is a private room downstairs that could provide a better ambience..",

    "text": "Absolutely superb food, let down by robo-service of the worst kind and lazy management. \u00a0First the context: \u00a0We took a cancellation and the three of us had a 6pm table in the bar area. \u00a0It's not the main room so we cut them some slack on ambience. \u00a0(However I wouldn't go back to sit in the bar area. \u00a0Too sterile.)The first seven minutes from sitting down were so rushed that it became comical. \u00a0Within that seven minutes (yes, we started timing it) we were (in this order) seated, given drinks menus, given main menus, served bread, asked what water we wanted, served water, asked if were ready to order our meals (while the drinks menus were still open), asked if we're ready to order wine, served house nibbles, ordered our drinks, then ordered our meals. \u00a0I GET IT THAT YOU NEED THE TABLE BACK BY 8 (although in the end YOU DIDN'T AS THE AREA REMAINED HALF FULL WELL PAST 8), but there has to be a better way to pace dinner. \u00a0Maybe the staff were so eager to get the first table going that they threw everything at us. \u00a0Either way, it was so off-putting that we went on strike. \u00a0We put our main menus down and waited until we were ready. \u00a0All the food was simply wonderful. \u00a0Drinks were great (someone said \"best gin-based drink ever\"). \u00a0Between three people we had three drinks, one bottle of wine, two apps, three mains and two desserts. \u00a0Every dish got \"This is awesome\". \u00a0Well done to the kitchen. \u00a0Also well done to the serving staff. \u00a0It was all spot on.But only two stars to the house management. \u00a0That first run of the game was just amateurish. \u00a0The lighting over the table was also faulty. \u00a0Two out of the three bulbs were flickering, to the point of distraction. \u00a0I saw other bulbs in the room doing the same. \u00a0When I pointed it out the lead front of house raised the lighting, which stopped the flickering. \u00a0But then it was too bright. \u00a0So later someone lowered the lights again, which brought back the flickering. \u00a0Change your bulbs. \u00a0All of them. \u00a0Also the music in the bar is utterly useless. \u00a0It is too thin (way too much trebble) and just bad. \u00a0It was simply noise of the worst kind. \u00a0The low point was when they served the pre-dessert. \u00a0The room was so full of useless noise (not bar chatter, but rather an annoyingly stressful 80s song) that not a single one of us heard one single word that the poor waittress said. \u00a0And she was leaning in, no more than two feet from our heads. \u00a0We'd all go back for the food. \u00a0We'd never sit in the bar area. \u00a0We'll see what happens next time! \u00a0Lesson to management: \u00a0just because you're playing a more relaxed attmosphere doesn't mean you can relax. \u00a0Sweat the details.",

They were late arriving, but I felt welcome and looked after while I waited. When they did arrive, the guy was three sheets to the wind. During our meal, he kept lifting the baby onto his shoulders \u00a0she lurched dangerously amongst the designer lighting, as he seemed oblivious to the looks of frozen horror, and the forks poised midway between plate and lips of the diners around us (I truly am sorry if that was you). The reason I mention this is that the service was totally professional, all the way through. We were treated with friendly efficiency, and food and wine were both exceptional. It's the measure of a place how they deal with awkward situations and customers, and I've got no hesitation in rating this a 5 star restaurant.",

    "text": "Sweet Jesus, Mary, and Joseph this place has good desserts.I will be upfront with you all and say this restaurant is way outside of my budget and I even ate a meal before I came as to not break the bank. Blasphemy, maybe, but this place is known for its dessert bar rather than its minuscule (although fairly delicious) meal portions. I only had soup for real sustenance and I only ordered partially not make my dining mates uncomfortable as I slowly enter a drunken stupor without anything to nibble on to cut the alcohol. It was a tomato gazpacho with crab meat, delectable though it was it was about the size of a newly born hamster (or maybe a small beach crab would be a better comparison in this case) and cost \u00a310.As we came to Pollen Street Social for my friend's birthday, it was of the utmost importance that we take full advantage of the dessert bar, which on this fine evening was manned by a chef named Joe. Joe was not only easy on the eyes with a good sense of humour, but that boy prepared two excellent desserts for us. While he ignored my suggestion to shove a candle in the tiramisu or sing Happy Birthday (double Blasphemy), he was incredibly thorough in explaining how all of this nonsense was made (as I half listen, half gorge orgasmically). The two desserts (a deconstructed tiramisu and a sort of pile of candied fruit and fruit/veg/herb sorbets) were accompanied by hot chocolate and three different sorbets to sample. Just thinking about it makes me want to eat a chocolate bar while running around the block (in feeble attempts to cancel out the weight I am gaining just thinking about our dessert while satiating my now drooling sweet tooth).ANYway, I would say Pollen Street is worth the \u00a3 for the desserts. The rest of the food is obviously good as well, but not as exciting or inventive.",

They even have special stools for your purse :)While lunch isn't cheap, it is a good value for the quality of food. We were presented with a box of amuses, which included the best pork rind ever - fried in house, light and airy with a dusting of seaweed, yum! I got the poached egg, toast, and mushrooms to start while hubby had the terrine. Both were delicious and beautiful to look at (a consistent theme here - everything that came out looked gorgeous!). We moved on to a perfectly cooked cod fillet with squid ink vinaigrette and braised beef cheek. Desserts were amazing! Aside from what we ordered, they presented us with a special cake square for our anniversary that looked like a ring box with edible silver on top. Dark chocolate ganache... mmm. Then finally finished with little almond cakes that were still warm. We left so relaxed and happy with our meal!",

    "text": "It seems I had a slightly better experience than GrumblingGourmet with my visit to Pollen Street Social. In short though, I can't give it more than 3 stars due to the service, price and that the dishes were a bit hit and miss. First the service. We arrived at 5.30 and were told they were booked out for later in the evening but there was a table from 6 to 7.45. Not wanting to wait 30 minutes and then sit down we asked if we could grab a table right away. No problems with that. The thing they forgot to mention though was that the kitchen didn't open until 6.00 leaving us to pass the time with some (fairly expensive) bar snacks and cocktails. I wasn't too fond of my cocktail I have to say but the chipirones (small squid) were excellent as a starter with the heat of the green chilli they came with. Overall the service seemed sketchy and confused throughout the evening. When you leave you trade the key you get when you arrive for a small bag of breakfast stuff, but they forgot to give us the key. All minor issues that added up to a bad experience with the service. The food was quite good, at least mine was. The cauliflower & squid with clear roasted squid juice and truffle was tasty and light with a nice added element of the crunchy truffle bits on top. The heirloom tomato salad, tomato vanilla gazpacho, tomato sorbet and creamed burrata was excellent as well, great for such a hot day. Very refreshing. The mains were good and bad. I had the rack of Cotswold lamb, braised belly, sheep's milk curd was perfectly cooked and had some interesting combinations of flavours. The West Country ox cheek with tongue & sirloin, carrots, caper & raisin pur\u00e9e and horseradish mash on the other hand was really dull. The only redeeming feature was the horseradish mash which was great. The tiramisu for the dessert was a bit heavy for me and more like just ice cream with some chocolate crumble to go with it. It was OK but no more than that. If they sort the service and the dishes out I would consider coming back again. Funny enough regarding the dishes Jason Atherton was a couple of tables over with his family trying new ones out and commented on one as \"a 5\". Hopefully that won't go on the menu.",

    "text": "PSS is one of those rare places that not only lives up to expectations - it smashes them. I don't often find that a restaurant that I've looked forward to going to for ages really matches up to the utopian version in my head. The service is lacklustre, the food bland, or perhaps the wines didn't complement the meal. But not so with PSS as Jason Athernon's newest effort prides itself on sleek elegant form, a novel approach to drinks, and an open and well-crafted view towards the balance of tastes and textures in each dish. Sure, it wasn't perfect (and we'll get to that later), but would I go back? Damn straight!I initially thought I'd write a full fledged review, however it's passing 4 pages in MSWord so perhaps a summary would be more appropriate. Anyone interested in a detailed run down and evaluation - please drop me a line.The food is excellent both in taste and presentation. The standout out of the array of starters was the squid and cauliflower. I will admit that upon reading the description, I thought \"nice but kinda boring\". I could not have been more wrong. While not as visually bold and appealing as the other dishes, each shade of white and cream represented a flavour bomb waiting to land on your tongueThe squid was tender and paired well with the creamy cauliflower. Hidden bits of puffed rice added a surprise crunch that was pleasing to both the palate and the ear. Overall, an exceptionally well designed and executed dish.For the mains, the tasting of ox (cheek, tongue, and sirloin) had the fullest flavours and felt the most satisfying. I will note that the Spanish prawn rice accompanying the red mullet was also exceptional. The rice, served in a mini-sauce pan, had a spicy smoky flavour that was incredible. A cross between a risotto and a paella, it slipped over the tongue in a red creamy sauce and seduced your senses. \u00a0I'd happily eat the rice as a main course on its own.The sommelier is very friendly and helpful with choosing a wine. Plus points for actually listening and participating in a debate about wines and then selecting one in our price range without trying to shamelessly upsell. The cocktails were fantastic and demonstrated the high level of skill of the barstaff while showcasing their creativity.Dessert was an experience all to itself. If you can, leave your table for the glamour of the dessert bar where you can watch the lovely ladies of all that is sweet prepare desserts in front of you. It makes it uber hard to choose which dessert to have and thus it's better to go in a group where you can order several and share. My top pick was the PBJ which had the freshest and most delicious flavours of peanut butter and raspberry jam I've ever had (including in a PBJ!). Plus, the peanut meringue is made with liquid nitrogen which just knocks it up a notch.Slight minor gripes would be the bread guy not knowing much about the bread (beyond \"white\" or \"brown\") and the bill taking another 15 minutes to arrive after we asked for it but nothing to really mar the evening.",

Very friendly staff, very knowledgeable bartenders and waiters, who really tend to you.We arrived on a busy night, still felt genuinely special.The food then, well I can agree with what someone else wrote about what's on the menu. Nothing stood out for me when I first looked but we'd heard that the desserts were great and I was feeling like a steak, so Rib-Eye it was. Not expectiv much from a still fairly pricy (30GBP) piece of meat - BOY did they blow me away.Best piece of meat I've had in a long while and I just tried out Palms and Goodman. Fellow diners had Oxcheek which just fell apart from tenderness with a potato pure to die for.We were then given the opportunity to sit by the dessert bar and talk to the chefs there while they prepare and being able to form our own opinions on what to have. They were all fantastic. Just right amount of \"molecular\" cooking with a pure explosion of tastes (who would have thought that black-olive ice cream or basil sorbet would rock your socks off)So yes, we did splash out and this place is not a cheap eat (which I tend to love) but it was just worth it. Because this to me was much more than dinner it was a full on gastronomical and guest service (which many people get wrong) experience.",

Now I'm going to spend a ton of money to return to London to eat at this restaurant.Where to begin - quiet, hidden location; large modern dining room; service as good as any you'll find; a menu where you want to try every. single. thing.; enough extra courses to fill you up on their own; quality of ingredients as good as California.Let's get one thing out of the way; London is crazy expensive for Americans. OK, so recalibrate your cost expectations. Within that context, PSS is an upper-end place but not ridiculous.No time now to detail every course, but of the four of us (starters, mains, desserts, plus amuse and other freebies) there wasn't a single miss. Everything was spot-on and just amazing. Large portions too. :)For London fine dining, I can't imagine anything better.",

They focused more on presentation and lacked delicacy. We were able to see the kitchen and saw something gross. Both the main chef and second chef were doing this. They would taste the dish with a spoon and then use the same spoon without disinfecting and washing. Often they would dip the spoon in a tiny water container (not running water) and then reuse the same spoon. Yuck! They were pretty diligent about inspecting the food visually or by touch (for temperature of bread) before the plate went out to customers. Dessert was pretty good. It was fun to watch the pastry chef use liquid Nitrogen for most desserts. Oh, they also miscalculated our bill. Bad sign for a pricey restaurant. Will not go back.",

    "text": "I'm torn. I really wanted to like Pollen Street Social. I was really excited about it! After one of our good friends mentioned that he wanted to go with us to a nice meal in London with his wife, PSS was the very first place I wanted to go try!So the other half and I arrive early to have some drinks. The cocktail menu looked amazing, and every single cocktail we had was interesting and unique, and my favorite by far was the Shiso Lovely (Asian influenced with Kaffir lime leaves? sign me up!), but we also had The Professor, Rum and Coke (a specialty drink, not just your standard R&C), The Rumbullion, and the Vintage Vesper of which they were all great. They all supplied us with fresh salted nuts whenever we ran out, so it was a fun time to be had before dinner.For dinner, we had the tasting menu. It looked interesting, and we were all excited about it. We asked for help to choose wines to pair, and that's when things started to go downhill. The sommelier seemed clueless. She stood there barely suggesting things, and the ones she did were very inexpensive. Not that expensive wines need to be suggested, but it would be nice to have a variety. We selected a white and a red, and I was a bit dubious about the white selection (Chateau Ste. Michelle in Oregon? It's a fairly big winery, and not something I would consider. That being said, it wasn't the same label as usual, and was in partnership with someone else, and the wine was reasonable). The other half decided to put the wine selection into his own hands after that, and he managed to do a better selection of wines than we were told about during the wine selection.Now for the food, honestly, of the eight courses we had, which were all interesting conceptually, the only one that really stood out as spectacular (for me) was the scallop sashimi. The Japanese flavors really came through, and the horseradish snow was very nice. The next two that were really good were the desserts. Both were pretty in your face with flavor. Other courses were lacking something. The turbot needed quite a bit of seasoning, it was mostly bland. The duck was a bit tough and chewy. The oyster ice cream was overly fishy/salty tasting. The full English breakfast was interesting, but hard to get all the flavors together at first, and the tomato really overpowered a lot of the taste (for me). The crab salad had some sort of granata on top which really wasn't pleasant with the rest of the meal. Most of the courses seemed like they were trying to hard to have an interesting take on something, or an interesting combination of textures, but failed in the flavor combination (unfortunately a problem of presentation over flavor I think). We had a bit of an issue at the end with the petit fours. First, a small cake (which was amazing), then some candies and some mini macarons. There were three different flavors, and the other half and I wanted to try all of them. The server refused. The other half pushed, and she said she'd have to talk to the manager. She came back and said that they would charge extra for them. I wanted to drop it then, but the other half asked how much, and finally they came back and said we could have them for free. I've never had a Michelin star restaurant give us such a hard time over a few extra petit fours. To be honest, the macarons weren't really that great to have been given such a hard time over.So would I go back? Depends. I would definitely go back for cocktails, as they were the best part of the night. I might even try the dessert bar, as we were seated near it and the stuff coming from there smelled great (and the two desserts on the tasting menu were great as well). I wouldn't go back for the food, it wasn't interesting or special enough to be given another go. There are other fine dining places that I'd want to eat the food at before coming back to PSS.",

Even better it was just a few blocks from my hotel. So off I go. I get there at 5 min before 12 and they open for lunch at 12. The place is completely empty. I ask for a table for one and the hostess responds with \"just one?\" as though somehow one was not enough. She then informs that they don't have any tables available. Did I mention the entire place is empty?! When I bring that somewhat obvious point up, she offers to seat me at the bar. Ok fine seat me at the bar, I'm tired and hungry. She seats me at the worst possible spot at the bar right over the sink. Since I'm only 5' 3\" my feet are dangling off the stool. I am so tired I know I am just going to slide right off halfway through my meal. So I get up and go back to the hostess and say if they can't seat me at one of the literally dozens of empty tables I am just going to leave and find somewhere else to go. She goes back to get the Manager to speak to me. The manager informs that they can seat at one of the tables in the bar area not the main dining room as long as I won't be more than an hour since they have many lunch reservations. Lovely. Fine I agree I won't take more than an hour to eat my lunch. So now I am seated at the worst possible table in the bar area with the wait station right behind my head.What kind of serious restaurant treats customers this way? Ok so now for the food. The food was actually quite good. Lunch is a prix fixe menu for about 25 pounds which is a very decent price for decent food in London. My starter was something with smoked haddock, a poached egg, and a green sauce. It was exquisite. My entree was something fish. It was also perfectly executed but not very memorable. The vegetarian menu on their website was not available for lunch. Fortunately I think of fish as swimming vegetables but there were no vegetarian options on the lunch menu. Something to keep in mind if you're vegetarian. All in all the food was great but the staff is way to uptight for the \"deformalized dining\" this restaurant claims to offer. The food is on par with any good restaurant in San Francisco but I think overall London restaurants have a lot to learn about customers service and not taking themselves so seriously...",

    "text": "London does high end dining incredibly well an Pollen Street Social met all of my expectations. I visited on a cold and wet Monday lunch the week before Xmas and the dining room was absolutely buzzing. \u00a0Must have been all that Xmas cheer in the air. This is a big restaurant. The spacious dining room upstairs is large but feels spacious with a small pre-dining bar area and a sneaky view into the kitchen and a large team of busy busy chefs. \u00a0Downstairs is a lux private room which would be perfect for a special occasion or corporate event, a very versatile space. We choose the excellent value 3 cars Xmas set lunch which at \u00a335 was a bargain. \u00a0The menu was gorgeously seasonal and quite complex. \u00a0All choices sounded gorgeous but I went for the clever entree eggy full English breakfast, a gorgeous lamb shoulder main course and Thai flavours dessert which was fresh, pretty and light. \u00a0The wine list is huge but the friendly sommeliers are on hand to guide you should you need any assistance with the many many options. \u00a0There are wine to suit most budgets as well which is great. \u00a0I would have liked to see a few more beers available - just the meantime lager, pale ale and IPA were on offer which is a shame for a British restaurant living large on its local produce when there are so many incredible ales produced right here in Britain. We we pleasantly surprised with between course treats - 3 canap\u00e9s to start, a zingy pre-dessert cleanser and maroons with coffee. \u00a0I love surprises and these are the very best kind! Rather than being stuffy this was an exciting and engaging dining experience. \u00a0Many elements of the food were interactive and the busy, festive dining room made it clear that everyone there was having a great time. \u00a0All in all this was an entirely pleasant way to pass a rainy afternoon. \u00a0It's not cheap but it is a great example of the Brits doing a fabulous job at world class restaurants. \u00a0Jason Atherton and his team should be justifiably proud.",

    "text": "We went for a special London Restaurant Festival event. Full disclosure David Gandy was present, which may or may not influence this review!We started things off with cocktails at the bar. We got chatting to Monica, one of the bartenders, and she talked to us about her inspiration for the cocktail list. We loved the Pisco and the Professor cocktail, pisco, fino sherry, lime and flat leaf parsley, inspired by Monica's travels in Peru. The cocktail list changes regularly and we are very tempted to come back and work our way through more of Monica's creations!The appetizer was yellowfin tuna tataki with cucumber salad and avocado and ponzu dressing. Ponzu is Japanese citrus based sauce (yes I googled for you!) and the appetizer was lovely, light and refreshing. Just what you want when you know heavier course are around the corner.We started with a \u00a0quail, broad bean, pancetta and sauce diable. The quail was cooked perfectly and a summery dish.Next course was rack of Romney Marsh lamb with braised shoulder shepherd's pie. It felt like we'd moved from summer to winter, the shepherd's pie was hearty and indulgent, I don't even want to think about how much butter probably went into the mash but it tasted divine. The lamb chops were ruby pink and delicious, but the fat was flabby and chewy. I think either crisp the fat or remove it, my preference would always be to crisp it, fat=flavour. Sadly, I had to leave mine on the plate as it was inedible.Finally dessert, white chocolate mousse with salted caramel and shards of caramel hazelnuts. I have to say I don't really like the trend towards salty/ bitter desserts, for me those flavours can be present but they need be balanced with sweetness, otherwise what's the point? You might as well have another plate of savoury! I was surprised by this dessert because in the past I've found white chocolate to be sickly sweet, but here I think they were so intent on keeping that in check that the balance went the other way and it just wasn't much fun to eat.I much preferred the petit fours which were fun, playful and more crucially sweet! Rapsberry and almond financiers, and yuzu and blackberry mini cones dipped in white chocolate were delicate little mouthfuls with which to finish.Just a quick mention about service, we were tucked behind a little corner and we felt a bit forgotten about. On a couple of occasions we asked for more bread or water and it either never came or arrived very much later. However as I mentioned David Gandy was present and it was a full house, so maybe service was not representative of what it normally is.",

The atmosphere was good but it was absolutely BOILING in the main dining room - they had fans but they didn't make much of a difference. The amuse Bouche at both the beginning of the meal and the end were INCREDIBLE! Churros with a honey dipping sauce, delicious chorizo fritter and a flat black olive bite were incredible! I asked for the signature/ most popular dish on the menu and straight away was told the quail for a starter and turbot for a main. The quail was interesting really fun presentation and pretty good. The turbot was really forgettable which was disappointing for a signature dish. With all of the great London spots I'm not sure I would go back.",

Monica talked to us about her inspiration for the cocktail list.Starter was quail, broad bean, pancetta and sauce diable. The quail was cooked to perfection and this felt like summer on a plate.Next course was rack of Romney Marsh lamb with braised shoulder shepherd's pie.The lamb chops were ruby pink and delicious, but the fat was flabby and chewy.Finally dessert, white chocolate mousse with salted caramel and shards of caramel hazelnuts. They tried too hard to keep the saltiness and sweetness balance and so was just a bit lifeless. It just wasn't much fun to eat.Just a quick mention about service, we were tucked behind a little corner and we felt a bit forgotten about. On a couple of occasions we asked for more bread or water and it either never came or arrived very much later.",

    "text": "Hands down, the best place for fine dining in London. One of the best things about pollen street social is the indulgent in-between-course treats that they offer FOC. The goat cheese churros with honey dip, one of these treats was simply amazing. My main course was the sea bass, which really wasn't too spectacular. I would recommend ordering red meat dishes such as the venison, which is more substantial and hearty for exactly the same price. I was impressed with the chocolate marquise, mousse and praline which we ordered for dessert. However, the goat's cheese rice pudding was just overwhelming, DO NOT get that unless you seriously love goat's cheese! Overall, this place is definitely a winner and unlike other fine dining restaurants, you won't leave hungry or broke.",

    "text": "Oooh was that lunch delicious! I went to Pollen Street Social on a group trip to London and was delighted when I saw the restaurant chosen for that lunch. The Yelp reviews were great and I must say I very soon knew I would be another one to add a 5-stars review to the place.Let's be brief:- Design and setting are perfect. We were seated in a small salon downstairs, absolutely perfect, chic, cute and quiet. A dream.- How much food can you eat? We had pre-starters, lots of bread, starter, main course, dessert and pre-dessert! All was absolutely delicious and I won't spoil your pleasure and tell you about the dishes here, but they were really worth it and both traditionnal and very original. Loved it all!- Service was a dream too. Very attentive staff, a French speaker waitress to translate what strange words such as \"halibut\" or \"venison\" might mean, and a special choise of dishes for vegetarians at the table. Perfect.All in all, a definite 5 stars and I definitely want to go back to PSS and spend more time there! PS: I didn't pay for the meal so I had no idea about the price rate, but I checked on the website and I think it's quite good value for money! pollenstreetsocial.com/m\u2026--- En fran\u00e7ais : un \u00e9tablissement que je recommande chaudement ! La cuisine \u00e9tait d\u00e9licieuse, le service parfait, les vins tr\u00e8s bons et les quantit\u00e9s impressionnantes ! J'y \u00e9tais en voyage de groupe et n'ai donc pas pay\u00e9 ni vu les prix, donc je ne peux pas juger le rapport qualit\u00e9-prix, mais pour la qualit\u00e9 seule, c'est un sans faute ! J'y retournerai ! PS : Apr\u00e8s v\u00e9rification ce n'est pas donn\u00e9 mais plut\u00f4t bon rapport qualit\u00e9-prix ! pollenstreetsocial.com/m\u2026",

    "text": "Drinks:-The wine list is a 30-page exceptional read with favourtism given to the wines of France. \u00a0-Most glasses run from 8-15, and bottles can go up to 2500-Wine pairings can be arranged to go with the menu offerings, which was the route my partner decided to go. \u00a0All of the pairings were appropriate and thoroughly enjoyed.-Bar Manager Gareth Evans has created a remarkably creative and innovative cocktail menu that changes often. I took a quick peak and decided that I absolutely could not resist. It was going to be a boozy night.- I had a crazy hard time deciding because literally everything struck my eye. Each drink featured whimsical presentations with unique and exotic ingredients including sweet pickle juice, toast and jam (still not sure what that is), beetroot rose, and \"British eccentricity\" (you will see what I mean below).Day of the Dead : (13.50)-Blew my mind. Yes that's a skull, and yes I ate it. The drink arrived with an antique style perfume atomizer, which the server used to spritz with chocolate mist. The result was an incredibly balanced drink with wicked sex appeal.Great British Cobbler #2 (13.50)-If you like big fruit flavours, this is a must try. It was sweet, tangy and beautifully aromatic, and I loved its British cheeky charm.Jimmy's Giant Apricot :(13.50)Again, a really well balanced drink, this one being the least sweet of the bunch. I liked the combination of the floral apricot with the tangy pineapple and the bitter plum. Fab.Food:-Chef and owner Jason Atherton was the first British chef to complete a stage at Spain's elBulli restaurant.-They offer an a la carte menu as well as a 8-course (85) and 6-course (60) tasting menu that can be paired with wines if requested-Not surprising considering chef Atherton's training at elBulli, there is certainly a significant molecular gastronomy influence in all of the dishes-We opted for the 6 course meal and decided to select a different main course so we could sample more (the only option we were given in that evening's menu)Snacks: Pork Crackling; Parmesan Biscuit with Tomato and Anchovy; Caraway Cracker with Whipped Smoked RicottaServed in a big hollowed out book, these bites were a lovely start. My favourite was the caraway with the smoky whipped ricotta.Tartare of Irish Fallow Deer, Smoked Beetroot, Wild Leaves, Berry Pearls, Sourdough CrispsMy favourite savoury dish of the night. The gaminess of the venison went beautifully with the sweet beetroots, tangy berry pearls and the caraway-scented crisps.Roasted Dorset Monkfish, Cauliflower, Dehydrated Grapes, Apple & Curry, Spiced CaramelMy least favourite dish of the night. While I loved the cauliflower with the aromatic curry and fruit flavorus, I didn't think it worked well with the fish. I also wasn't a huge fan of the monkfish's texture, which I found a little rubbery for me. Roasted Squab Pigeon, Salt Baked Red Cabbage, Beetroot Stained Onions, Yakitori Pigeon OffalI loved the natural sweetness that the beets imparted on the caramelized onion, while the squab was perfectly seasoned and surprisingly tender. \u00a0Lake District Rack of Lamb, Braised Shoulder, Fregula in Basil, Olive Powder, Artichoke & Smoked Tomato ChutneyThis to me was the better of the two mains. The lamb was flawlessly prepared, and the shoulder was cooked to a meltingly tender consistency. The star, however, was the herb scented fregula which offered a delicate little pop and brightened up the whole dish.Mini Ice Cream : Mango, Yogurt and Coconut SorbetWhere they get these baby cones I don't know but I would certainly love to find out. The combination of the sweet mango, the creamy coconut and the tangy yogurt was incredibly refreshing and fun.Cantaloupe Melon & Camomile Tea Sorbet, Yogurt, Sudachi LimeSimilar flavour profile to the palate cleanser that came before it, but this featured an wickedly fragrant lime front and centre. The combination of the sorbet with the yogurt yielded a texture similar to a silky foam that simply melted on the tongue in a state of utter bliss. \"Thai Flavours\" : Peanut Cream, Green Apple & Yuzu Puree, Compressed Celery, Frozen Praline My favourite dish of the night. It tasted like a sweet version of the classic pad thai with a wonderful balance of salty peanut and fresh tart apple yuzu puree. I loved the texture of the compressed celery which lacked any stringy or fibrous quality, and the little bits of praline were addictive.Petit Fours: Strawberry Jams Financier, White Chocolate Ginger Lemon Chocolates, Macarons (Green Tea, Chocolate Ganache, Japanese Peach)A lovely way to finish our meal alongside some cappuccinos. My favourite little bite were the white chocolates as their sweetness were nicely balanced by the sour lemon. That sweet tangy flavour kind of reminded me of those yogurt candy covered raisins that I am completely and utterly in love with",

He doesn't just have his name to the place, he was actually in the kitchen. I'm not sure if this is an every day occurrence but it was nice to see him doing his thing in the open kitchen.We had the tasting menu which I thought was delicious. The things that stood out to me were the frozen horseradish and scallops (seems to be everywhere at the moment), the all day breakfast in an egg shell, then turbot with the cauliflower cheese puree, and the beef with the marrow crumb. All that was needed to leave me satisfied was a Highlander cocktail complete with Scottish weather cloud (lavender whisky on dry ice) which was probably the best whisky based cocktail I've ever had.Overall, the vibe was smart but modern (no white tablecloths and compulsory jackets here); the food and drinks were delicious; the service was attentive but not overbearing (very important for me), the lighting was intimate but not dark, and the open kitchen was a bonus. Highly recommended!",

We had cote de boeuf and it came with carrots, beans and Mac n cheese. It was very filling and we couldn't finish it. We also had starters and they were both delicious. This place isn't priced like Nandos, and probably not at the price point for most to pop out to on a whim (also needs to be booked in advance) but it was, in our opinion, very reasonably priced. It was better than most of the steakhouses I've been to in London, if not all. My only minor criticism is the use of space in the restaurant. We lucky didn't have anyone sitting next to us until we were about to leave, but I'll put it like this: I could smell her perfume above the aroma of food, too close for me.",

    "text": "Pollen Street Social may be somewhat of a mainstay on London's fine dining circuit, and we found it generally deserves the accolades. From the moment you step into the refined space, there is a sense of confident luxe. The dining room may be streamlined and posh, though it is not sedate, particularly as the night progresses. Jason Atherton's menu leans toward familiar flavor profiles, but his approach is not at all banal. Cuisine is executed with precision and finesse. The wine list contains an interesting array of options, with some highly rated gems. Service is top notch and professional. Overall, we really enjoyed our experience and think it warrants the Michelin star. Look forward to trying Chef Atherton's NYC outpost - The Clocktower.Atmosphere- Sleek and modern; a minimalist luxe that still felt approachable.- Some white table cloth formality, but the approach is not stale.- Pleasant din; neither noisy or too quiet.FoodJason Atherton's cuisine is clean, and a pleasant blend of classic flavor profiles with a refreshed viewpoint. It would be nice to have some additional vegetarian and meat courses on offer for the first course. The weak point in our experience was clearly the dessert course, as the Brogdale Pear lacked both heft and interest. We enjoyed:- Raw Orkney Sea Scallop (pickled kohlrabi, nashi pear, black olive, jalape\u00f1o granit\u00e9 - \u00a322): Even as a non-seafood eater, I enjoyed this dish. It was very delicate and refreshing, though still flavorful; the granit\u00e9 was especially interesting. Nice, clean dish to start with.- Whole Roasted Goosnargh Duck (braised swede, quince, pesto served with a salad of duck leg in Moroccan spices - \u00a379 for two): Loved it! Deeply flavorful, and the salad was interesting in and of itself. Wish the fat had been rendered slightly more; but near perfect.- Brogdale Pear (goat's milk ice cream, honey & bee pollen - \u00a313): Least enjoyable dish; it came as a tiny slice of pear. Flavors were basic. Needs more than the bee pollen gimmick.BeverageWine list is extensive at Pollen Street Social, though some areas could use additional options across a variety of price ranges (e.g. Burgundy). There is a nicely curated list of by-the-glass options. We selected the 2013 Domaine des Lises (Maxime Graillot) Cornas (\u00a3135) from Rh\u00f4ne to enjoy with our duck. While the wine had pleasant aromas, it was rather tightly wound and tannic. Would have really appreciated if the wine had been decanted to soften things up; surprised about this oversight, as it sat in the bottle the entire evening. With dessert, the 1996 Ch\u00e2teau Coutet Sauternes (\u00a315) is a nice option.Service- Very hospitable and attentive, making good recommendations when asked.- Not overly mechanical or impersonal.- Failed to decant wine, which was unfortunate as it could have benefited from such.- 12.5% service charge automatically included.",

The food was inventive, the service was warm and smooth, and I knew I wanted to come back the next time we were in town.When I came more recently, it was a very different restaurant; prices have risen considerably, and the food is more conservative, less fun. Service was very spotty; some staff were warm and welcoming, others perfunctory and even officious. It took a very long time to get our first courses, although it did pick up after a while.I can't help but think that this is due in part to the clientele; it seems that with fame, a different set of people have become interested in Atherton's restaurants. That's a pity, as this was one of my favourite restaurants in London.",

They must have come to our table over 20 times. They brought the salt and pepper, then the bread alone, then the butter alone, then the water plate alone, then the water, then they swiped the crumbs off the table before and after every dish.

    "text": "I have been wanting to go here for a while now and decided to give it a go when a special occasion came up.  We arrived without a reservation for lunch and took a seat at the bar. \u00a0We had a great afternoon, eating and drinking, but I would have to admit that my high expectations weren't met by the meal we had.  We started with a really refreshing cocktail. \u00a0I don't remember what it was called but it had beetroot juice and ginger beer in it. \u00a0We got served the book of little snacks that everyone has mentioned. \u00a0 This was a non-memorable diversion. \u00a0Everything tasted fine but it was hardly an explosion of flavour in your mouth. As a starter, he had the crab salad and I had the scallop carpaccio. \u00a0I only had one bite of the crab salad but it was tasty and light. \u00a0The scallop carpaccio was just ok. \u00a0The scallops, while fresh, tasted a bit heavy and felt gluey in the mouth. \u00a0 The normal sweetness of raw scallops didn't quite go with the kohlrabi. \u00a0I really struggled with this flavour pairing. \u00a0Additionally, I'm still confused as to the purpose of the frozen grapefruit. \u00a0I actually was more impressed with the fact that someone had taken the time to separate all the little grapefruit pips than anything else!  For our mains, he had the duck and I had the lamb. \u00a0Both were good but given the \u00a330+ price tag, I was expecting OMG AMAZING. \u00a0It was not all that. \u00a0The duck was beautifully presented with the purple beetroot really making the dish stand out. \u00a0The rack of lamb came as two perfectly cooked pieces and the shoulder was shredded and formed into a little breaded disk topped with the fregola. \u00a0It was all very tasty and you could not fault the cooking but everything lacked the little bit of extra oomph I was expecting.  Given all this, the standout was really the service. \u00a0The bartenders were chatty and perfectly attentive. \u00a0It was a low key dining experience and it was totally enjoyable. \u00a0We didn't want to spend a lot on wine, only about \u00a340. \u00a0I was slightly embarrassed that they sent the sommelier over but we told him our price range and what we wanted and he not only proposed an excellent French red but it came in at only \u00a329. \u00a0There was no upselling which was a really nice surprise! \u00a0 \u00a0 So overall, it was a good experience, made all that much better because of the service. \u00a0The food was all well prepared but there was nothing about it that made it stand out.",

    "text": "Lovely modern french restaurant. First proper meal in London for me on my first visit. Came on the recommendation of colleagues, and was not disappointed. Had a 3-course set lunch, but with all the additional amuse bouche and petit fours, might as well have been an 8-course meal! Service is polite and pleasant. They have a full service bar and an excellent selection of spirits and cocktails. Ordered a gin martini, and was very pleased that the bartender stirred the cocktail by default. The martini was excellent, and served in a mini wineglass instead of that silly upside down lampshade they call a martini glass. My lunch partner had his cider served in a most righteous pewter mug. Food is excellent. Flavours are well calibrated and not overwhelmingly heavy on the palate, which Asians like me are more sensitive to. Had ham hock terrine starter - a nice mix of saltiness and funk. Amuse bouche comprised canapes - smoked salmon on bread, a dill cream cheese thing, and a cream cheese raspberry mini tart which was divine. This was followed by a mushroom tea with cream. Rich mushroom stock, and silky cream - tasty. Had the pheasant, which was roasted and served on a bed of fennel and endive, and an orange compote. The pheasant was well roasted - not too gamey and tender. The orange compote set off the flavour of the meat very well. Dessert was a selection of ice creams and sorbets - ranging from a rich vanilla ice cream, to a strangely complex peach grapefruit thing, as well as a surprisingly lovely lavender and lime. My favourite was the pear sorbet. Rounding off the meal was a petit fours of apple crumble and chocolate ganache, and a scotch caramel flavoured with Bowmore 15. A very epic lunch, a great way to start off my London experience. I could barely have dinner! Will try to visit again before i go.Update: Visited again with my missus before leaving London. In the interim, I read up on Pollen and learnt it was a Michelin-starred establishment. So I arrived with slightly higher expectations, and was not disappointed. My missus had the set lunch, and I went a la carte. Waitress suggested the special, which was a truffle linguine in parmesan foam, which I opted for. Had a seafood soup for starter, which the waitress suggested I have as a second, so as not to overwhelm my palate before the truffle linguine. Very thoughtful! The meal was excellent, and we were given the option of having dessert at the dessert bar, which we gladly did. Watching the patissiers at work was most delightful. The highlight of our meal though, was having the opportunity to meet and greet the proprietor and head chef, Jason Atherton, whom we saw from afar in the kitchen, busy helping to finish the dishes before service. He was kind enough to help my missus out of her chair, and I took the opportunity to gush about the food. He was most obliging, and spent a few minutes chatting with us about his new tapas restaurant in Singapore, Esquina. And he was very kind to oblige me with a photograph. A very class act, and I'll be sure to visit his restaurants here in Singapore... Once my wallet recovers from this very pricey, but very satisfying meal.Another update: it seems that Jason Atherton has divested himself of his partnership with Unlisted Collection, and is no longer involved with Pollen at Gardens by the Bay, Esquina and the like.",

Although lunch officially stopped at 2.30, I managed to get a reservation at 2.30, and they were nice enough to hold it until 2.45 since I was rushing there from outside London. Throughout the meal, the service was very unhurried, formal and very attentive. Loved it.Food-wise, it was fantastic, and we especially loved the amuse bouches that came with the meal. It was a lot of fun, and we appreciated how the staff took the time to explain every component of the dishes. We had:Starters- Chiled pea soup, citrus creme fraiche, peas & gambas- Cumbrian beef tartare, sourdough crouton, goat's curd, truffle dressing & dried vinegarMains- Roasted Cornish cod, English crayfish, summer vegetables, Scottish girolles- Roasted breast & confit leg of Goosnargh chicken, truffle braised celery, apple, endive & summer squashDesserts- White chocolate mousse, caramel hazelnuts, salt caramel ice cream- Strawberry & calamansi \"Eton mess\"Highly highly recommend the cod - it was fresh and amazingly tender. The chicken breast was very moist and flavorful as well. We had mushroom tea and cheese churros with truffle honey to start, and I loved them. They also came on a pretty tiered stand which lent itself very nicely to photos. Pre-dessert was also awesome, in the form of yogurt and strawberries with a glass straw. My favorite part was the frozen chocolate banana ganache, which was very light and not overly sweet. Highly highly recommend :)(Sidenote: We saw many of the other diners receiving a little bag of chocolates (?) when they left, but we weren't offered one when we left :( )",

    "text": "We went to pollen street social for New Years eve. \u00a0The food was pretty good, but after a week eating whatever and wherever we wanted, it was by no means out of this world. \u00a0The reason for my poor review is the service. \u00a0After a really disappointing experience, I sent the below email to the Pollen group and to the restaurant manager. \u00a0I opted to contact them directly rather than complaining on yelp, but..... It was sent 3 weeks ago, and I never heard anything back form them. \u00a0A restaurant group with this reputation should really pay more attention to service, and at least give the courtesy of a response. \u00a0email I sent:To whom it may concern,I wanted to write you let you know about my husband's and my experience at your restaurant on New Year's Eve so that other guests do not have a similar experience. My husband and I stayed at the Rosewood hotel and they suggested that for us to contact you directly.We were excited to try Pollen Street Social for New Years eve dinner after hearing great things from our friends in London and the concierge at the Rosewood. \u00a0We arrived early and waited at the bar and were finally seated nearly 30 minutes after our reservation... I get it... New Years Eve is crazy. Once seated, our dinner was off to a fantastic start. \u00a0The food was good, and service attentive. \u00a0It was once we got close to midnight that things fell apart. \u00a0A server came by at 11:30 PM \u00a0asking if we would like champagne at midnight, and we said that we would love a glass to toast the new year. It was the last we saw of anyone for well over 45 minutes. \u00a0Midnight came and went and our wine and water glasses were empty. We watched as the staff celebrated and we were just waiting at our table. \u00a0At that point we were thirsty, tired and ready to leave. \u00a0I'm sure you can understand that it is unnerving to see the staff loitering and having fun while we're patiently waiting for service - water and our last course for 45 min.I know that the 31st is a big night for restaurants, but it is also for your patrons. \u00a0We were thoroughly disappointed with the experience-- especially because Atherton's restaurants are so hyped around London and that we paid nearly $400 US Dollars for dinner. Our experience was well below the price we paid for dinner.I hope that you will share with your staff as a way to improve operations.",

This was weird because my table was actually for 2.. They just took away the extra seat.So i opted for their 2-course lunch set, very decently priced at \u00a326. I got a soft egg starter and a lamb neck main. Aside of your order, they also would offer you white/brown bread & butter and three canapes, which was uniquely presented inside a box.Food came very timely. The soft egg starter was delicious and the lamb neck was so so tender. Overall it was a very good experience especially for the price! It's definitely one of the cheaper dining option in london, at least for the lunch set.",

    "text": "My friend and I dined at Pollen Street Social last night, eager to add a Michelin star to our collection. If I could do it over again, I would advise skipping the starters and the desserts, because the standout feature of the restaurant is their outstanding presentation and execution of the free amuse bouches and petit fours. For the amuse bouche, we had a mushroom and cream soup that was utterly divine. This was served in a teapot. The rest came on a high tea type of tray with churros and truffle honey, a cornbread type thing, a little black square which I can't even describe, and a green sauce vaguely resembling pesto (my best guess is that it's a parsley or alternative herb type of pesto). The latter went well with the cheese garlic bread they had on offer, which was very more-ish. For starters, I ordered the squid \"cooked in cauliflower, roasted squid juice, ink rice & sea herbs). I thought it would be like grilled squid with a small spoonful of rice, but instead it was like risotto, and the squid was cut into pieces the size of rice grains. Innovative, but not entirely my type of thing. My friend got the salad of British garden vegetables, and that was just a few large leaves of lettuce, with hardly any dressing. She didn't enjoy it very much, and only nibbled on a few leaves.For mains, I got the lamb, which came with a braised neck and merguez sausage. It was well presented, with the usual sauce in a separate pitcher, but overall it was just an ok fine dining dish, and not worth the \u00a338 they are charging at Pollen Street Social. My friend got the suckling pig, which is apparently their other most popular dish along with the lamb, and it was also just ok. What I also felt compromised the experience was the fact that it took over half an hour for the mains to come out, after we had already had two courses. When I asked the staff to check on the dishes, they came back and told me 1-2 minutes, and it turned out to be another 5-10. Then after we finished the mains, the staff came back and asked if they could interest us in some cheese, I thought this was going to be complementary to make up for the delay. It wasn't, so when they wheeled over the selection of 12 cheeses, we politely declined. They really made no apology for the service failure. This annoyed me so much that I genuinely considering removing the optional service charge.After we also declined to order dessert, had paid the bill, and were ready to leave, they came out with the petit fours. First, there was a grape mousse that was so light, we initially thought it tasted like strawberry and pineapple. There were then a number of other items: a dark chocolate mousse, an innovative variant of apple ice cream served in a tiny wafer cone, and a madeleine. By that point, we'd already eaten far too much, so only had a bite of each. Overall, I think the amuse bouches and the petit fours are a nice touch, but I struggle to see much value in this restaurant. The wine list was similarly outrageously expensive (it was difficult to find a bottle under \u00a340), and all mains are over \u00a330. Everyone around us was drinking bottled water so we did too, and it comes at \u00a34 a bottle. It's billed as a bistro with deformalized fine dining, but I found it quite the opposite and rather formal, more appropriate for a business dinner. You won't have a bad meal, but there are plenty of other places in London that can offer the same for much less.",

    "text": "There is a musical genre that involves taking the finest melodies, employing a large number of classically trained musicians to play these melodies to an arrangement that has been planned by enormously talented arrangers. The purpose of this music is that it is then played in the background to dinner parties or dates. It is not supposed to intrude on the conversation.In case you are in some doubt the music I am speaking of is Easy Listening.Now superficially fine dinning can look very similar to Easy listening music. Finest melodies = best ingredients, army of classically trained staff ... Check and finally the planned arrangements by enormously talented people ... Well some chefs seem pretty impressive to me.The key differences are that for the price of a fixed price lunch at a Michelin starred restaurant most people can buy more easy listening albums than any two people will need in four lifetimes. After all the point of easy listening is that it isn't supposed to be the centre of attention and to my mind fine dinning really is supposed to be the centre of attention.Pollen street social has decided that there is a place in the market for a fine dinning restaurant where the food should be as much like Easy listening music as possible.It is all beautifully presented, beautifully made and there may even have been some clever touches (ice cream made from creamed corn) but at no point is any of it exciting. Nice to eat yes exciting NO.The wine recommended to us also pretty much fit the bill and none of them can have been considered cheap (I actually had more interesting wine at the 28-50 at the corner for a lot less).Now I recognise there is a place in the world of music for easy listening and I recognise that there is a place for expensive restaurants in the west end that serve easy to eat food and easy to drink wine at very high prices. If those are the things you want from your night out then Pollen street social may be the place for you.Personally I want my food to be exciting and my wine to be interesting and maybe I and my friends will spend less time talking about our jobs, our families and being sophisticated and spend our evening being blown away by someone else's talent in what can be done with food and just how good their wine cellar is. Oh and I still go to gigs that are too loud to talk during.",
