I would recommend the one with vegetable dumplings. The fresh juices on offer are different - the detox one has a real punch of ginger and leaves you feeling energised after. Theres a good variety of different sushi combos and love the way the sushi comes with glass noodle or rocket salad and toasted pumpkin seeds too - something a bit different. I only wish I could afford to eat here every day for lunch!",

It's hoisin duck soup is rubbish. You get barely any hoisin and the duck is the sort of stringy stuff that makes you think dark thoughts of animal camp documentaries. Ditch the duck and pick the excellent (and super cheap) vegetable option instead, then ask for some teriyaki sauce or similar to have over the top of it. The sushi and salads are all delicious and it gets an extra star for being extraordinarily well-priced and a lovely, civilised place to sit in an area where you generally want to shoot yourself after 10 minutes.",

Bland, supposedly healthy, unexciting. And the list can go on. the same sauce can not go with 67 other dishes, in what world did the chefs think this worked?!Dont go here hoping to board the train to flavour town. it DOES NOT depart from here sadly.",

    "text": "I like this place. \u00a0It's tasty, and healthy, and affordable. \u00a0SWEET TRIFECTA, BRO.Their marketing claims that Itsu is the Asian-influenced brainchild of some of the founders of Pret. \u00a0In that regard, I can see some similarities: stocked shelves, efficient pay system, done. \u00a0The hot stuff looks good, but I head for the coolers, always. \u00a0My go-to are the low carb salads: rare-cooked salmon on a bed of greens (n.b.: if you hate cilantro, there's some in the dressing) and a delicious tuna salad that has thin-sliced leeks included. \u00a0There's a chicken/avocado salad, too, for the low carb-ers among us, but that just doesn't seem to trade on the strengths of Itsu.I'm also a fan of their sushi, edamame and protein pots. \u00a0Always fresh, and really affordable. \u00a0It...su delicious! \u00a0Yelp note: I especially like how I have the option to \"PIMP MY FOODS\" care of toasted sesame and sauces (hey, chill!) and pumpkin / sunflower seeds at the condiment bar. \u00a0Sometimes I like it saucy, sometimes I don't, you know? \u00a0(I usually do, for the record)",

And with all the delicious sauce and meat they packed in.... plus they are kinda fast food-ish, Itsu is a healthy choice for people on the go. I got the dish with duck meat, and it was delicious.I also bought their packed salmon sashimi bento, and the salmon tasted really fresh. I now wish there were more Itsu's around.... and please open some in the Netherlands. I'm definitely a fan.",

    "text": "On a recent shopping excursion to Piccadilly on a rainy Saturday, we wanted a quick, inexpensive lunch and as Pret a Manger was packed with people not wanting to head back into the rain, we popped into Itsu. Itsu was a Japanese version of Pret but with a lot more tables, quirky Japanese whimsy and very healthy food options. My husband enjoyed a steaming bowl of tofu, brown rice and steamed green vegetables while I had extremely fresh salmon sashimi and a couple of avocado sushi rolls. Just for fun, we tried their Thai sweet chili popcorn and chocolate popcorn. Both were delicious and very low calorie! Definitely wish we had Itsu in the USA!",

Yea yea i don't expect it to be as good as the ones in Japanese restaurants but still with a similar price wasabi sushis are wayyyy better....",

    "text": "This review is specifically about Itsu's frozen yogurt. My wife and I jumped on the froyo craze many many years ago and we have tried practically every brand in the US. We were dying looking around London for a frozen yogurt place when we stumbled into this fastfood sushi place. A bit about our tastes, we are purists when it comes to froyo and we specifically love the plain tart froyo. No matter where we go that's the flavor we will get and the bar with which we grade how much we love the froyo. The froyo at Itsu is much thicker and tangy compared to what we have tried in the past. It is much closer to the Greek yogurt taste that you might have tried in the past. (Actually, we have thought of plans of trying to recreate froyo at home using Greek yogurt) If you're a fan of plain tart froyo you should make a trip to Itsu to give their froyo a try!",
