    "text": "It may be the lunch shift, or the menu just being not my style (in general I find British food less than appealing), or the noise level - just didn't hit home for me.I'll be honest, I would happily do 3.5/3.75 stars, it is a good spot, and I would certainly return for a business meal. The service is quite good - very attentive without being intrusive. The service gets 4 stars really, and were no doubt stressed by the general holiday rush.The food is well executed and looked great, as one might expect, what troubled me is the dullness - everything tasted fine (if a bit under seasoned) but the menu just so \"what to choose when these all seem so similar.\" It is likely a combination of my ignorance of traditional British cuisine and distaste for much of the same left me less than impressed.I suspect someone who better appreciates traditional British dishes would find the menu very pleasing. The local colleagues I was with were thoroughly satisfied. I appreciate that the execution was quite good, but the bland flavors just left me wanting more.Perfect for business lunches and dinners - everyone will be please, but few will be blown away.",

    "text": "Having been a regular in New York at the London Hotel outpost I've had a love hate relationship with Gordon (I was delivered $200 moldy chocolate covered strawberries from room service, and have yet to forgive him). THAT IS, until back to back sensational dining experiences at the Savoy Grill this WEEK! Service was flawless as were both cuts of beef. The first night a flavorful well seasoned, perfect temperature Rib Eye and for the second, what as a Yank, I call a perfect New York strip. The cocktails were great and sommeliers poured generous portions of wine by the glass as I went solo. The chefs went out of their way \u00a0allowing me to order the foi gras that was a special the first night and not on the menu the second. First time I've had it with a mushroom preparation. Superb! In short, the strawberry incident is forgiven and the crusty bugger that is Gordon Ramsey has redeemed himself in my eyes by delivering two exceptional, memorable meals during my stay. Kudos.",

We had a small caulifour soup as the first course, this was really good, they could really have just served a bigger bowl of this and missed the next course. Then it was beef carpaccio. For some reason mine looked and tasted well done - which was weird for a carpaccio and didn't really work as it was too chewy and there was no sauce - but to be fair most other people's were bright red and clearly raw. Quite a lot of people still left theirs though, the general comment seemed to be that it was quite big chunks of raw meat, rather than delicate thin slices like it should be. The next course was halibut. This was a little bit rubbery, so I think it was a bit over-done. Finally we had rum baba. Pretty much no-one round the table finished this, which I think was down to a combination of wine consumption and the fact that it tasted a lot like sugar mixed with chemicals. And they nearly forgot my coffee.",

The bread was very poor though - rock hard and impossible to eat. Waiters and waitresses in abundance, and a bit over powering at times; they constantly top up water and Champagne (to get the second sale i suspect), even before you have taken a sip! Also not one was English and they were often difficult to understand. Also, the chips - despite what it says on the menu, they are NOT hand cut and were clearly frozen - i cant see how you run out of fresh potato on a Monday. But all other things were superb, and the food was not too expensive either. Great range of Champagnes, but silly prices. Restaurant manager (who is English) was superb though.",

The kitchen staff became like family before the evening was over. Every course was presented by the cook who made it and all were very jovial, young, passionate and friendly. I may be mistaken in calling them cooks because it seemd like they were instrumental in the concept and creation. We got to prepare and cook our own steaks which were some of the best meat I've eaten anywhere, even in the wild west. The private dining room with one big table looks onto part of the kitchen through a big window. We could not hear anything from the kitchen but got to watch the intense activity involved with preparing dinner for a very large party upstairs. This in no way delayed our feast but we did witness the F bomb from the chef, which was hilarious, as was the staff reaction to it and their smiles and shrugs to us. All part of the Ramsay culture and why we were there. There were so many courses of great food we couldn't even touch the final presentation of chocolates. It was definitely a worthwhile experience.",

    "text": "I visited the Savoy in London many years ago and since then at destinations globally. My fianc\u00e9 and I made a reservation at the Savoy Grill in London for 9.00pm on the 1st of September, under her name. My future parents-in-law flew over from Rome for their first trip to London and this was to be their first meal dining out since landing in the UK. As you can appreciate, meeting my fianc\u00e9s parents for the first time is an exceptionally important event. Hence why I trusted the Savoy to deliver an excellent service, as has been present previously. Once arriving we were seated promptly, however, we were then informed that their was a problem with the oven/grill, rendering all items from the grill section redundant. For a place called the Savoy grill I consider this completely unacceptable, however the situation deteriorated further from there. They knew about the issue 2 hours before our arrival, and we were not informed, which I consider extremely rude considering they had all our contact details. We then ordered the lobster as an alternative and were again informed that they had run out of that as well. To compensate, the staff moved us to Simpsons (another restaurant in the Savoy) where we were told that there would be steak available. We were seated below the air conditioner (the table first on the left when entering) and asked for it to be turned down 3 times with no measurable change. So much so that I had to go to the cloak room and retrieve a jumper and jacket for my future parents-in-law so they were not too cold. I too went and got a jumper. We looked at the menu briefly and myself, her father and mother all ordered the rump steak. Two minutes later the waitress returned to inform us they were out of that here as well. I can't remember a time that I've received such bad customer service. I could probably have made a better first impression taking them to Nandos.",

The food and the wine were excellent but the main waiter who looked after us was so pushy to take away our plates and make us order more food that it ruined the whole experience. We arrived at 5:30, time of the booking, and after being seated, the main waiter handed us normal menus so we told him that we wanted to try the pre-theatre menu and he replied by listing champagne/cocktail options although we already asked for water so he recommended still or sparkling water and when we replied that we just wanted tap water he looked annoyed and left. Then he came back with the pre-theatre menus and returned not even a full minute later to ask if we decided what we wanted. A couple of minutes later he came back and we made our picks and he tried to make us order a side dish and, again, looked annoyed when we said that we didn't want any. Then we had a break from this waiter for the duration of the starter and as a was finishing my main (the poached sea trout) I took a piece of bread to dip in the remaining mussel broth and as I put it in my mouth the waiter came and took away our plates. Then he came back with the desserts options, we said we were happy with the bill and he tried to push for tea or coffee and, again, looked annoyed that we didn't order any! I don't know if the management encourages or not the waiters to behave this way but it is absolutely unacceptable for a restaurant to use a pre-theatre menu as a bait and then make customers feel guilty if they don't order more food.",

Very nice although rabbit could have been cooked a little more. Had side salade to start that was supposed to have shallots, but instead had very strong , overwhelming onions. I had pre fix lunch. Started with carpaccio. First time I have ever had it with cooked beef. Could have ordered from deli ( rare roast beef sliced thin). Next was sea bream. Very strong flavor, with something resembling hush puppy. Best part of lunch was plum tart with clotted cream. Oriental waiter was pleasant but had no clue about food.

First time to London and this place made me realize the mass disparity between the rich and the poor. I'm asian and right when i walked in, there were all eyes on me. Beginning with the host(girl) who asked me to take off a piece of clothing because it was their \"policy\". She then told her boss(girl) to come talk to me about my garment. I kindly said no, so she went to her boss (guy) to tell me off. After that, i just left. Leave me alone you asshats. Im here trying to eat dinner with my family and you had 3 people come up to me to bother me when the entire restaurant is dark asf. Nobody cares if I have a home ad garment on, only the staff. I left and went to flatiron carnaby to get my steak and not only was the steak well-priced but the service was impeccable. Was served by a younger crowd whom didn't judge you on what you wear or the color of your skin.",

A wonderful place to come for a special meal while visiting London, and enjoy the history and decor of the Savoy Hotel. The Beef Wellington for two is a must-have. My friend and I had dessert, but were also served some odd petit fours at the end of our meal. Beautiful presentation, but they all tasted quite weird. Otherwise, we enjoyed a wonderful meal - definitely place I would recommend and come back to.",

    "text": "WOMP. Disappointing. This was our big splurge meal in London and it was wayyyyy too rich for us. So maybe it's a preference thing? Beef Wellington is so heavy that I didn't want an appetizer because they had already given us bread and we ordered two sides with our main dish. But our server was super pushy and we kind of felt forced (and judged) into getting one. When she offered the tasting menu I replied, \"No thank you I don't eat seafood\" and she was not happy about that. Like lady, clearly you want us to buy the expensive wine pairing with tasting menu but I DON'T EAT SEAFOOD which are 4 of your courses. Then again with the appetizer \"they're small you should get two\" Yeah...then I won't eat my actual dinner. Ambience nice, and they were super attentive with refills. But the food wasn't worth it and our server was way too aggressive with the upselling. The crepe for dessert is delicious though! Much lighter than I thought it was going to be and actually a nice balance to our super heavy food.",

They come promptly with a variety of quality breads and butter and to take your wine order (Even the cheapest ones were the very smooth and well-aged). We had the Game Menu, which started with a wonderfully light smoked duck borscht consomm\u00e9. After a bit of time to digest the food and talk...the wood pigeon with pickled walnut pastry and smoked bone marrow came. This course was cooked perfectly offering a simple combination that was flavorful. The main course roe deer was cooked to a sublime medium rare and served with soft apples and a Gin Juniper Gravy. Best venison that I've ever had! We finished off with poached pears, an anise biscuit and a vanilla bean ice cream drizzled in a thick fudge sauce. We were then offered a whiskey and brandy cart and Americano coffees which included neutralizing lemon tarts and chocolates. This place isn't cheap, but worth it for a nice supper. You get what you pay for! If you do it do it right!",

But that isn't at all how it went down.The meal started nicely and attentively. The Arnold Bennett omelet was warm but not hot, but the entrees were delicious. However, we started to notice the time was running short, and at 7pm (when we had planned on leaving) we had to ask for the dessert (that came with the prix fixe menu) to be served along with the check. We didn't see anyone again until 7:20 when I finally had to ask for the check without having the dessert we paid for, because our show was about to start. By the time our card was run we had to hustle to Cambridge Theatre and we missed the first 10 minutes of the show - we were lucky to be let in!I was disappointed because I expected 4 or 5 star service from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and he clearly doesn't spend as much time on his actual restaurants as he does on his Hell's Kitchen ones.",

Was neither impressed or not impressed... I do not think it was over priced. From staff.. From checking in, coat service waiters etc... Spot on... Food.. I wanted to try other things... Sadly, and I'm not basing the review on this. I wanted to try Gordon's famous items. Unfortunately they were for two people and I was alone. That's fine, so I went with the Theater menu... I won't be exact, in fairness.. Because I forget exactly.. I started with the Hen egg mushroom starter. I don't like mushrooms.. So I removed them... I really enjoyed it, but I didn't think it was anything to special. Then I had the Artichoke Risotto Parmesan. Another... It was actually really good, a little to salty for me... But I don't use much salt. Then I had the cheese plater for desert... I'm certain I have this wrong.. But it was just a large serving of like blu cheese, Brie and cheddar or something. Disappointed... Presented nicely... But I would have preferred a couple smaller portions of better cheeses. It said assortant of British cheese.. Thought it would be different. To me.. 3 stars, is not bad. It is what it is. Great service, okay price, average food. I was a little disappointed.",

    "text": "The Savoy Grill is Chef Gordon Ramsay's classic British and French restaurant located in the gorgeous Savoy Hotel. The entire staff was very kind and friendly. I tried the \"Taste of Savoy Grill\" which is a seven-course sampling menu designed by Head Chef Kim Woodard. The Lobster and Cornish crab bisque with brandy butter was delicious. The Glazed Omelette Arnold Bennett was rich, decadent, and exceptional!!! (I could feel the LDL rising-but it is okay!) \u00a0I was not very impressed with the seared scallops with charred sweet corn, beans, and air-dried ham. It reminded me of a chef-inspired dish served on an airplane. I substituted the Fish of the Day for the Beef Wellington and other red meat options. \u00a0The salmon was a major disappointment. \u00a0You can find better prepared salmon at almost any gastropub. The selection of French and British cheeses were delightful. The lemon posset and a fresh blueberry (A blueberry was substituted by the kitchen instead of fresh raspberries) was a nice palate cleanser. Finally, the strawberry, basil, lime zest, and balsamic cr\u00eape Suzette flamb\u00e9ed at the table was a pleasant and fun surprise from a traditional cr\u00eape Suzette. \u00a0My dining neighbors ordered and split the Baked Alaska which they loved. I enjoyed my sweet gifts in a to-go box. The restaurant was very cold due to the air conditioning. The lady seated next to me mentioned it to several staff members several times. \u00a0I reached a point of discomfort also. \u00a0The freezing blowing air killed the ambiance and I really wanted to leave. I felt the timing was off in the continuity and delivery of the meal service. I ordered this sampling menu to get the 'entire experience.' I appreciated the choices, the progression of flavors, temperatures, and textures but it was too much food. \u00a0I would have preferred the a la Carte menu in hindsight. \u00a0This restaurant has seated many famous guests. I have eaten at other Michelin-star restaurants. \u00a0I was disappointed in that I did not feel the innovation, creativity, preparation, presentation, and delivery of this meal was at an equivalent level of other Michelin-star restaurants. \u00a0The prices, however, exceeded other Michelin-star restaurants that I have experienced (and reviewed.) I realize my expectations were high but this is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.... fairmont.com and gordonramsayrestaurants.\u2026",

To start with my husband and I shared the foie gras and escargot. The foie gras was very flavourful and creamy, but what really stood out for me was the escargot. The flavours were exceptional; every mouthful was a savoury delight. For the main dish I enjoyed the dover sole which was cooked superbly. They de-bone the fish at the table which was impressive. My husband greatly enjoyed his rib-eye steak too. On a previous occasion I have ordered the fillet steak, which was also fantastic. The stand out side dish for me was the cauliflower cheese. \u00a0We happened to be having a late anniversary celebration, so we were very impressed when \u00a0they brought out a variety of several small cakes to finish. Yum!For me, the restaurant loses one star as I enjoy a little more creativity on the menu than what is offered at the Savoy Grill. I also feel that although the service was very attentive, the servers were a little cold towards us. It has to be said that Gordon Ramsey does a fantastic job at maintaining such high standards of cooking at this restaurant. It really is a treat to come here for a special meal!",

Got a same day reservation when our original dinner plans had to be cancelled- this somewhat surprised me (it was very busy while we were there). Very formal service that was absolutely perfect at all stages. A bottle of mineral water & a bottle of French Chateau Lagarde (pretty much the only wine on the list we could reasonably afford- but it was delicious!). Started with seared foie gras for myself & lobster bisque for my wife- both marvellous. Wife had a perfect rib eye, while I had the delicious, deboned-table side Dover sole meuni\u00e8re. We shared sides of frites & creamed spinach. Total with optional service charge (tip) and \u00a32/each cover charge (?really?) was an astounding \u00a3231, but it was worth it to us for the incredibly good food and he whole experience.

We were entertaining long time friends and celebrating my husband's birthday so we were hoping for a special evening. Nothing special here. Slow dispassionate service. Mediocre courses. Even the acclaimed steaks were tough and not worthy of the flashy table side presentation of raw cuts and high prices. And the service was so lacking. We had to keep asking for water. Empty plates sat for unacceptably long periods of time in front of us and not a smile from anyone on the staff. Certainly not good value for money in a town with so many exceptional choices.

    "text": "Yelp comes through again...Gordon Ramsey style. I was tasked with finding a suitable dinner location (that took reservations) and could get us swiftly on our way to a show at the Noel Coward Theater by 730pm. A quick Yelp search \u00a0led me to The Savoy Grill, an upscale eatery within a beautiful hotel that had a history of getting theater patrons off to their shows on time. Done and done, reservation easily booked, and we were in business. We arrived promptly at 530, enjoyed a beautiful meal and arrived to our show with time to spare, easily catching a quick taxi from the hotel. Couldn't have been easier. The food was absolutely lovely -- a refined British menu. Simple, yet fancy. Well priced for the area (ignore the price rating -- it's truly not so pricey for London). I enjoyed the ham and chicken pie with a decadent cream sauce, mashed potatoes and a few chips I stole from my husband. The table also enjoyed a New York strip, halibut and the lamb roll. There was not one bit of descent from the crowd. Everyone was happily satisfied and stuffed. The service was excellent from start to finish. Welcoming, friendly, knowledgeable. Quick with drinks, wine and the food, which was important as we were on a timed schedule. Though they never made it feel rushed. It's got the old school charm of a classy restaurant -- without being stuffy. The crowd was mixed with hotel guests, theater goers, some tourists, young, old. The menu will surely strike just about anyone's fancy -- perhaps, maybe not vegetarians, but I'm sure there were even a few things for them. Would surely return. My first Gordon Ramsey restaurant -- and I have to say, it lives up to the legend. Headed to a show? This is your spot for a nice dinner beforehand. Thank me later and send me some chicken pie!",

    "text": "I was looking so forward to having a meal at one of Gordon Ramsey's restaurants. \u00a0I guess all that anticipation led to a bit of overhype for me. \u00a0My thoughts and expectations of what the meal would be was much higher than the actual meal was. \u00a0From a value standpoint, I have to say the name has given the establishment prices that are absurdly high. \u00a0I honestly could have passed on the whole thing.Dinner there started with the farmhouse terrine. \u00a0I got sucked into it as an appetizer because of the foie gras parfait that was served along side it. It was a solid dish. \u00a0The meat was succulent and you get the decadence that is added by the foie gras. \u00a0 \u00a0The green tomato chutney adds a bit of acid to bring everything together and brighten up everything. \u00a0The dim lighting of the restaurant kind of obscures the ability to see the elegant plating of the dish.I think my fault came in when it came to the entree selection. \u00a0I think I would have been much better off if if I went with one of the many selections from the \"Roasts, Braises and Pies\" section of the menu. \u00a0Don't get me wrong my Rib Eye steak was pretty good. \u00a0Cooked to the perfect temperature and was very juicy and didn't need much of the sauce. \u00a0However when I look at the menu and I compare that steak at \u00a334 to a lamb wellington at \u00a326, I kind of feel like an idiot for my selection. \u00a0You do get a nice flavor from the wood grill, but that particular steak was slightly overpriced in my opinion.Though I was ready to burst by this point I still decided to try out dessert, I went for the raspberry souffle. \u00a0About as light delicate and perfect as anything in I can remember, I suddenly felt betrayed by my stomach's inability to finish consuming it. \u00a0It was a really good dessert non the less.",

Sadly I did not feel that level of standard was met at Savoy Grill.My wife and I ordered the Scallop and Beef Wellington.Scallop was not seared at all, they put green tasteless crust on top. \u00a0The scallop was not very good and we did not eat half of the plate. The service was on point and they asked us if everything was okay with the Scallop dish. \u00a0They offered to not charge us for the dish or replace with another entr\u00e9e but we were already full and felt uneasy asking to take the charge off our bill so we didn't complain.Beef Wellington was the reason we came to this restaurant but it did not deliver. To be fair I've never had Beef Wellington but we do frequently eat at high end restaurants and we often make Prime Grade steaks at home. The dish was luke warm when served and the taste did not impress us. For what we paid, I would rather have a Waygu/Kobe filet at a nice steakhouse.",

Interestingly enough, I was underwhelmed. First off, kudos to the entire staff: Attentive, friendly, professional and eager to please. Top notch and excellent service! The main dinning room was smaller than expected. The ambience was a little lacking. Maybe some music in the background would help? We were introduced to a cart of cold Champagne right away (Yes Please!). Didn't care much for the escargot snail, which was blend and Unflavorful. My main entr\u00e9e, the scallops dish with pea green sauce was tasty. However, the three scallops were small bite size. That was another appetizer, right?? I indulged in my wife's Beef Wellington, which was cooked and sliced perfectly. The sides of mushrooms, mash potatoes and spinach were small and under seasoned. The dishes were two dimensional and appear to be missing additional ingredients and seasoning. The baked Alaskan passion fruit space was however heaven with very fresh ingredients. The food was overly good, but was lacking the Waw factor. Oh well, been there, done that. Next...",

As a large group (hen do but, you know, the tamer kind) sitting down for the set lunch the service was amazing - water kept topped up, food all brought over at the same time and all of this with efficiency and friendliness.The surroundings were pretty amazing too. You're in the Savoy so wouldn't expect much less but it's still pretty astounding.The food itself was good - tiny portions as to be expected with a dessert of profiteroles the standout (though too rich for some of the party). We should have got some sides to split between the table - for your \u00a330 you still need to add sides to your main. This wasn't a huge problem but it did feel a bit of a sting when the cheapest bottle of wine is also \u00a330. But then again, no one expects a cheap lunch at the Savoy.There was usual large group quibble over the bill at the end - once again, proving an optional service charge is never really optional in these places. But service was so good there weren't any complaints.For a fancy, occasion lunch this really ticked the boxes.",

After numerous complaints to the staff and management, nothing was done. I was shivering as a result. The food got cold very quickly. When you pay the price the Savoy wants, freezing conditions, cold food and a poor manageress (who stayed silent when I complained to her, waiting for me to find a resolution) is not acceptable in any way.The ONLY reason that the Savoy has two stars is because of the food and the food alone. Despite the fact that he souffl\u00e9 had coco pounder around the rim, which tasted bitter, the lobster bisque was very enjoyable, albeit very cold.My steak was over cooked and became rather dry as a result of this (medium rare came out as medium).Overall, this was a huge letdown and a major disappointment. Let's hope they get the heating right in the summer.NB: bring a winter coat to survive the air conditioning and a stern voice to deal with the manageress.Enjoy",

    "text": "I'm just going to cut straight to the point: overall a good experience but I was completely underwhelmed by the service my husband and I were given, considering we came prepared to drop some serious money on dinner and drinks.First off, I'd made reservations months previous and, recalling correctly, was asked upon booking the table on choosing either a la carte items or opting for a tasting menu instead. I remember selecting the tasting menu but, when we were seated, we were quickly offered only the a la carte menu...? Not a big deal, just something I was a bit confused about but, as we were only there for the beef wellington anyway, it worked out just fine.We ordered to start the steak tartare to share and a seafood cocktail for each, as we were pretty hungry and were told the beef wellington could take upto 45mins to perfect. The seafood cocktail was a surprising hit, served prettily in a martini glass with generous amounts of prawn and crab, dressed with the perfect amount of dressing. I was, at first, afraid of the amount of dressing (it didn't come tossed) but, after a quick taste, the dressing was delicate and light and coated everything perfectly.The tartare, though...I was blown away. I've had plenty of tartare before (steak, veal, bison, tuna, koi soi) but this one was up there with the best. Silky and tender, meaty and salted just the right amount, flavor that spread like butter over the grilled toast along with the egg yolk...I enjoyed this dish the most.The beef wellington came out quickly, much sooner than 45mins, I believe, although I wasn't timing anything. It was a delicate and juicy medium rare, sliced in two perfect medallions with a golden, crisp crust. I was already quite full by the time the beef arrived but certainly enjoyed the spread before me. The beef was plated before us, too, along side a head of roasted garlic and some spring greens.Service was wonderful in the beginning, but then lagged heavily. It was as if they forgot my husband and I were even seated. Water wasn't offered, dessert wasn't offered, other refreshments weren't offered, even our bill wasn't offered...The gentleman seated in the booth beside us enjoyed a meal and drinks and was half way out of the booth before I snagged a passing busboy for some additional refreshments. And it was odd, for we had 293847928374 people servicing us and all of 'em didn't seem to acknowledge us. :(It was fine, though. They did, before long, remember we were there and we were given all the goodies of dessert (we opted for light crepe and mulled berries with ginger ice cream) and espresso to top of our evening.Beautiful hotel, just beautiful. Gorgeous decor, plush seating areas, large, fragrant flowers and immaculate marble tiles...I fell in love with the atmosphere the hotel created, and along with it the history.All in all, I'd give the Savoy Grill another several visits, if given the chance.",

    "text": "A good experience, but I was honestly expecting a bit more, given the reputation of the Savoy Grill as well as the affiliation with the infamous Gordon Ramsay.Stunningly beautiful, a night at the Savoy Grill is like stepping back in time to 1935. While they don't seem to enforce much of a dress code anymore, I would suggest dressing smart to befit the swanky dining room. Dark jeans might be okay, but I wouldn't go any more casual than that.The service was very friendly, but the dining room staff were not as attentive as they could be. We frequently had to refill our own water, and our mains took an inordinate amount of time to arrive given that tables who arrived after us got their food far earlier than we did. The waitstaff didn't seem very polished for such a fine establishment.Food wise, I must say I didn't love the escargot. Perhaps this was a British preparation that I wasn't familiar with, but I much prefer the French style with lots of garlic and olive oil. These snails seemed dry and were served in an odd red wine paste that didn't do much for me. The beef wellington, however, was truly excellent and one of the best things I've ever eaten. \u00a0Dover sole was well-prepared and perfectly de-boned upon request. The sides were very nice but very traditional in nature (think truffle mash, sauteed cauliflower, etc.).I was let down by the dessert menu, which ranged from boring (ice cream) to odd (lime, peanut, and banana baked Alaska). Seeing nothing appealing, I turned down dessert, which I think last happened in 2003.Prices weren't too outrageous for central London, and there's a pre-theatre menu that's a very good deal.",

    "text": "Hmmm....There's a lot to like about Savoy Grille. \u00a0It's a beautiful space. \u00a0The food is often excellent. \u00a0The service is often spirited, human, and wonderful.I would recommend the Beef Wellington. \u00a0It was perfect.I would recommend the foie gras and chicken liver pate. \u00a0It was sublime in it's complexity and texture. \u00a0The flavor jumped onto the tongue.I would recommend the mushrooms as a side. \u00a0They were like no mushrooms I have had before. \u00a0Full and meaty, yet cooked through and with a flavor profile that developed throughout each bite.I would recommend the sommelier in particular. \u00a0So very friendly and approachable. \u00a0So very knowledgable about how to pair wine with food. \u00a0Wow.I wish I could end there. \u00a0I really do, because there are people who are skilled and try very hard at Savoy Grill.But then there was the waiter who gave us the \"Is that all you're ordering?\" tone, when we didn't order the 3\" thick T-bone. \u00a0There was the rib eye, ordered medium rare, but which arrived rare at best to the table, and the same waiter who looked at me and said, \"What do you want me to do about it?\"There were the crepes suzette, which that same waiter managed to drown in hot butter, turning a delicate combination of orange perfumed chocolate gelato on top of the crepes...into an immediate pathetic mush of sloppy dough and melted ice cream. \u00a0The service is the final mile. \u00a0In an establishment such as Savoy Grill, in which so much of the food is prepared at table side, personnel problems such as I found at Savoy Grill make the difference between a fabulous evening and a \"poor value for money\" thought. \u00a0If you could do take out at Savoy Grill, you might be better guaranteed a good experience. \u00a0As is, examine your waiter. \u00a0If you get the same bald guy with the French accent we had, you might be better off elsewhere.",

    "text": "Hubby and I are huge fans of the tv show MasterChef where Gordon Ramsey is a judge and he often references his beef Wellington. We couldn't pass up the chance to try it when we recently visited London.Serendipitously we were already onsite (this restaurant is located inside The Savoy Hotel) because we had come for cocktails at the famous American Bar. When we realized this Ramsey restaurant was here while chatting with the bartender, hubby went and thankfully secured a reservation.We were tipsy from cocktails at American Bar when we arrived for our late dinner (10:45pm seating) and didn't mess around with looking at the menu. We went straight for the Wellington and some cocktails that were actually made table side!! How cool is that?! They literally wheel out a trolley and make cocktails on the spot. Sure, I've had guacamole, salad, dessert made table side but never cocktails. The cocktails were fantastic! I'll have to update the post once I recall their names.Our Wellington took about 20 minutes and we started out with French onion soup and cauliflower gratin. Both were to die for. The soup was perfectly seasoned and the gratin was cheesy creamy heaven. The Wellington was definitely the showstopper. Perfectly cooked and wrapped steak in mushroom pate and pastry. Beautiful and delicious! And served with a head of roasted garlic on the side!! Highly recommend you dine here, and the Wellington is a bit higher prices than everything else but worth it if you've never tried it and are Ramsey geeks like us.",

I ordered the taste of Savoy which came with 7 courses made to be slightly smaller than if they were ordered singular. \u00a0The lobster bisque was outstanding with flavors of fresh lobster all throughout the soup. I had a nice and juicy piece of lobster tail on the bottom. The omelette had fish,cream, eggs, and was very tasty but heavy. The scallops was delicious and so was the chicken wing but I am not a big fan of cauliflower so I didn't like that part. It was served and a scallop shell over sea salt. I had the Beef Wellington cooked Medium-rare and it was nice but was very flavorful due to it being filet mignon which is very lean. There was a cheese selection which was delicious. I over the \u00a0Yorkshire blue cheese. There was a mandarin posset with a blackberry sauce which was nice and creamy but just not to my tasting. To end the meal there was a delicious o \u00a0and basil crepe which came with chocolate orange ice cream. It was \u00a398 for the tasting and I can't have wine due to being underage. I was very fortunate to have kitchen tour and meet all the chefs. We were all treaty with the utmost care and overall it was a amazing meal.",

    "text": "I really, really wanted to love this place, but sadly it was a let down. \u00a0I have always wanted to try Gordon's Beef Wellington and figured what better place than one of his restaurants in London.We got the tasting menu so we could try a few other items as well as the anticipated Wellington. \u00a0First course was Lobster and Cornish crab bisque. \u00a0The bowl came with a small piece of crab and lobster and they added the bisque at the table. \u00a0I was warned that it was really hot. \u00a0I gave it a few stirs and pulled out the lobster to give it a nibble. \u00a0To my surprise, it was cold and salty... (Could it be that they use frozen crab and lobster in the soup???). \u00a0I put the rest of the lobster back in and let it sit for a while to warm up with the bisque. \u00a0Overall, not good, not bad... Just OK.Second course was glazed omelet Arnold Bennett. \u00a0A very rich dish to follow a bisque. \u00a0I would have preferred a pallet cleanser between these two, but the dish was really good. \u00a0If this were on their menu as an appetizer, it is something I would order again. \u00a0Scotch is a sipping drink, not a shot... \u00a0Waitress, do not take my 20+ year Scotch!Third dish was scallop... \u00a0Seared scallop... But the were only half seared! \u00a0Instead of searing one side, they put a green tasteless chip on top. \u00a0If you take the green chip off, the scallop was OK, but would have moved up to good if it was just seared on both sides.No, I am not done with my Scotch! \u00a0Do not touch!!!Fourth dish was BEEF WELLINGTON!!!! The dish I have been waiting for!!! Something I can mark off my bucket list... Gordon Ramsay's signature dish!!! \u00a0After taking my first bite, I was expecting my taste buds to be in heaven... Only to be disappointed with yet another dish. \u00a0Not great, not good... Just okay. \u00a0 I have had better from a small hole in the wall in the San Fernando valley for a quarter of the price. \u00a0 I may be forced to chop off the waitresses hand if she tries to take my Scotch again!Fifth dish is cheese... DeliciousSixth dish was lemon posset with raspberries. \u00a0This was a very refreshing and delicious dessert. \u00a0Seventh dish was a strawberry crepes. \u00a0Awesome to watch them make and flamb\u00e9, but they were just okay. \u00a0They were kind enough to add on an additional dessert as a special congratulations to us. \u00a0This was very kind, but to be honest, it was just another let down. \u00a0If it were something tasty it would have been greatly appreciated, but it was a dry cupcake with some chocolate frosting. \u00a0Would have preferred a glass of champagne or a hearty handshake.",

The atmosphere is lovely, the staff is great and the food now makes me understand why Gordon Ramsay is a celebrity chef. What impressed me was that the waitstaff are actually good cooks and I know this because I ordered a Steak Diane and a Crepes Suzette which both have to be flambeed at the table. I was afraid the steak might turn out overcooked because of the flame but our waitress knew what she was doing and it was beautifully seared on the outside and medium rare on the inside (I hate it when someone turns a nice piece of steak into shoe leather) and it melted in my mouth. It was a good cut of meat but the credit belongs to her for cooking it perfectly. And a waiter prepared the crepes suzette at the table and it, too, was wonderful. I was actually sorry I waited until the end of the week or I would have eaten there again before returning to Manhattan. But I am glad I chose it for our anniversary because it was a great meal served in beautiful surroundings by professional and friendly people.",

    "text": "This place most definitely lived up to the hype. As Ramsay is one of my favorite social media personalities, I had to go ahead and try his flagship restaurant in London and I was not disappointed. Unlike many other fancy restaurants, Savoy does offer an exclusively vegetarian menu with several options which made things really easy.They start off everyone with bread and butter and the quality is quite high. I prefer the white bread over the whole wheat bread in terms of taste and found it a bit too hard to eat the crust of the bread.For the appetizer, I shared the Glazed Omelette with Comte and it was the best omelet I've ever had. Typically, when there is cheese in an omelet, it can be overwhelming, but in this dish, it was extremely subtle and rich enough, but not too creamy. I tried to eat it as slowly as possible because I wanted to savor and remember every bite. Usually, I need pepper and ketchup to make an omelet taste good, but this one is so so good on its own - just the right amount of flavor. For the main course, I had the mushroom and burrata vol-au-vent (had to look it up) and was very impressed. I was already pretty full and satisfied with the omelet and bread, but still enjoyed and wanted to eat all of this dish. The mushrooms are made very well - extremely juicy and full of flavor. The outside puff pastry is the flakiest I have ever seen for a puff - extremely crispy and not too buttery or sweet. The burrata could've been a little bit stronger but does blend well with the mushrooms and the cep ketchup. We didn't order dessert but they did bring us tiny macaroons which were absolutely heavenly. The inside chocolate was thick, creamy, and not too sweet. The service was very nice, helpful and quick and all the food ended up coming at a reasonable price. I will definitely need to come here again next time I'm in London.",

    "text": "This is a Gordon Ramsay restaurant. And as someone who watches all his shows, it was a must when in London. I started with the haddock, cod, and salmon fish cake. It was on a bed of pea and lovage, and topped with whipped cod's roe. Really perfect appetizer. (What is lovage, though??)My entree was a play on Shepherd's Pie -- a beef cottage pie with a cheddar mash. So much flavor and depth. Literally. It was a deep dish. I also tried the grilled park rib-eye with apple ketchup and a side of buttered leeks. Not better than the pie but well worth it. These dishes were a part of a special menu in partnership with the Savoy Theatre which is a 10 second walk from the restaurant. This special menu is deliciously affordable. It also comes with a glass of bubbly. Water is not free. It's poured from an unmarked bottle. Because we ended up paying for it, I'm glad I drank several glasses.And lastly, service was NICE. My phone was dead from using it all day sightseeing and yelping, and our server offered to charge it for me at the host stand. And dinner was paced perfectly so we could get to the theatre on time. Really great pre-show experience.",

In particular, the infamous beef wellington...But dang, the beef wellington was soooo SALTY!! Like, spoiled in so much salt!!!? It was seriously inedible. Very annoyed to waste \u00a388. Even my fiance loves salty food but this was WAY TOO SALTY. We spoke with the manager who claimed it was cooked as normal and no one else has complained... very, very disappointing. So, over half of the dish was left to toss. The manager offered us dessert on the house, but because we were one of the last ones dining, I'm sure they just gave us whatever leftovers they had. The food overall was very heavy and did not have any finesse. We made the mistake of booking two reservations here as guests of the Savoy, and a lot of restaurants were closed on Christmas day. We were hoping they would redeem themselves, but nope. Just average food. We couldn't cancel our reservations or they would charge our credit card on file.I really wish I could like the food here, but it was so boring as well. We were here twice in one week and dessert had the same ingredients (ie lemon and raspberry pastries). On Christmas day, we had dry turkey. Yuck.In the end, wasted TOO much money. Horrible place to eat. Save your money!",

I booked it for a large group work dinner without fully appreciating the lienage of the hotel or the restaurant.We were seated in a beatiful, private room that was great for an intimate group gathering. The set menu, while relatively simple, had some good starters and protein options. Starters included butternut squash soup and salmon tartare.Steak is a good default here and the tender, juicy tenderloid did not disappoint. And there were decadent desserts to top it all off: sticky toffee pudding, dark chocolate mousse with polenta shortbread, and marinated pineapple carpaccio with chili, lime, and mango (what!).Everything else, from service to wines, was also tip top. Overall, a very good value for the ambiance and group experience.",

We came for the Wednesday lunch trolley special of beef Wellington. (It's been on my bucket list since our first trip to London). It was delicious. A perfectly cooked piece of meat with potatoes and cabbage. The mashed potatoes were so creamy and delicious. It was a lot of food, at one point I didn't think I'd finish my beef Wellington but it was so good I couldn't stop eating it. I'm really glad I came and if you're interested in trying their beef Wellington the Wednesday trolley special is the way to go. It was pretty busy so I'd suggested making a reservation. Total cost for two trolley specials, a glass of wine and an espresso martini \u00a3110.",

    "text": "Our visit to the Savoy Grill was supposed to be the food highlight of our trip to London, but it turned out to be quite the opposite.We arrived right on time for our reservation and were told that our table wasn't ready and that it would be a while so we should go to the American Bar in the Savoy Hotel and have a drink. We're usually fine with a little pre-dinner drink (and don't get me wrong, the American Bar had INCREDIBLE cocktails), but it was a very pricey mistake on the Savoy's part, as we were left killing time in the American Bar drinking \u00a325 cocktails that we didn't plan on, nor did we need. We've been to many upscale restaurants and whenever we've been left waiting by that, cocktails are compliments of the house as an apology gesture - PERIOD.So, \u00a350+ and 2 cocktails later our table was ready. We were seated and immediately offered champagne by waiter #1 from the champagne cart, and since we had just killed time with cocktails we were pretty hungry and wanted to just get right down to ordering our meal - no frills, no extras. We came for the beef wellington, and that's what we wanted - not to mention after seeing the pricetag on the cocktails at American Bar we were a bit leery of ordering champagne from a cart with no price tag on it. It very well could have been \u00a350 a glass the way things were going, and we didn't want or need it.Waiter #2 comes and offers us water, which we accept, and then she says something about a 9 course meal which we had signed up for (which we hadn't) and walks away before we could question it. Were we really getting forced into 9 courses at this point? I was honestly so confused and then had remembered it came up as an \"offer\" when booking on OpenTable. To be clear, I had not accepted this offer nor was it stated anywhere on my reservation, so we figured we'd just catch her when she came back around and tell her what we'd ACTUALLY like to order.Waiter #2 walked by several times but passively ignored us probably about 5 times, when waiter #3 came and took our order. We ordered beef wellington, as planned, as well as a side of truffle mashed potatoes.While seemingly inputting our order on the computer about 5 feet away from our table, waiter #2 is lurking behind waiter #3 scolding him for taking our order - because of course, we WANTED the 9 course special (wrong). She investigates the 9 course debacle and seems frustrated when she seems to find no record of it, as we tried to tell her (if only she had given us the time of day). She gives us a dirty look and proceeds to ignore us for most of the remainder of the evening.During the 45 minute waiting period for our beef wellington, not a single person stopped to ask if we needed anything, despite multiple tries to get their attention to bring more water to the table. We finally got the attention of waiter #4, who we hadn't seen before but seemed to work there and made eye contact with me so I asked. He accepted to bring us more water, but then never came back.Let me preface my review of our actual food by saying I've watched most of Chef Ramsay's shows and seen him cook beef wellington on TV many times. I had visions of grandeur - perfectly cooked, delicious, melt in your mouth goodness. Our actual meal was not a vision at all, in fact. It was bland, uninspired, and just not cooked to perfection at all. The meat was fine - not good, not bad. There wasn't enough puff pastry. The sauce they put on the meat tasted like store-bought au jus from a packet. And the truffle mashed potatoes were not only small, but they were essentially just mashed potatoes with a couple of tiny truffles sprinkled on top.While our entree was disappointing, we saw our neighboring table order a baked alaska and it looked good so we decided to order, and honestly it was the highlight of the meal. Without that, between the tardiness of our table, atrocious service (It's still absolutely appalling to me that we were passed off to FOUR different waiters and not one was even the slightest bit personable), and lackluster food, I wouldn't have had a single star to give the Savoy.Next time I'm in London, I will definitely go elsewhere - somewhere that values service more and doesn't discriminate against those who don't want a ton of extras with their meal. Sorry Savoy, not everyone needs a 9 course feast.",

I had the frau Grois pat\u00e8 to start, decent, tattinger champagne good but 38 gbp is expensive, and the beef Wellington, and a crepe for desert. Across the board the food was prepared excellently but the flavor was either bland- the Wellington, over overpowering the crepe. The Wellington for 2 was 82 gbp and I would probably never order again. It was bland, however the red wine au jus was fantastic. All in all, a dining experience of two extremes.",

    "text": "Finally, good food in Britain. I was losing hope and my taste buds were starting to die off one by one until Savoy resurrected them back to life. Yep, they are still working, taste buds that is. The Grille is an Art Deco 1920's-30's theme. I could imagine Churchill or Coco Chanel whisking around the corner. It's gorgeous in an old British way. We ordered Escoffier's tasting menu. Yes, THAT Escoffier, the famous gentlemen in the culinary world with that iconic instructional cookbook manual. He may have been a crook but he could cook. The Bombe can be lit on fire two different ways, directly or in a pot and poured on. Either way, the spectacle and drama of culinary is still alive here at Savoy Grille. The crepes are freshly prepared at your table too. Gratuity is included with the tasting menu so sit back, order, and let the entertainment begin.Amazing service - but allow 3 hours for dining.",
