Sincerely, I don't have many confrontations, it's almost the first time that I eat in a traditional English elegant restaurant.Taking it into consideration, I loved it: the roast beef was simply perfect, so was also the Dover sole. In addition I tasted for the first time the Steak & Kidney Pie, whcih I also found interesting (and beautifully prepared).The place is old, traditional, looks like it has always been there. And service, lovely.We enjoyed a good New Zealand wine.A liittle bit pricey, but of course, it's London.",

The food is fine, it is not \"Too die for\" it's fine, it's ok, it's pretty consistant. Nothing more than that. The last time i went my partners liver came not pink, not rose not a little under done but damn well raw cold and jelly like. We then had to suffer a very patronising waiter try to convince me, \"veals liver is meant to be that way sir\" Bullshit! Thinly sliced pink no problems, thick (i mean very thick) slices cold and jelly like in the middle no. I chose (yet again) roast beef, well of course. It was fine.....not wow amazing it was fine. No one can deny the restaurant is quite special, in terms of structure of the room, decor etc. However, after that i seem to find it boring and clearly lacking a buzz, atmosphere, just something not quite right. Go to Simposns, please do, if you are a well expierienced \"Dining out kinda person\" don't (don't) expect to be blown away. I know restaurants, far, far, far better for quality of food. Simpsons not even in that race. Stand alone on food (Foreget the very special restaurant) i don't think Simpsons could cut it now, competing against the new breed of great class food, modern british restaurants. Simpsons is over priced, vastly over priced for the food. I guess if your happy to pay a lot of money to sit and look at the special restaurant fine, but i dont think you will see the value of your money on your plate. frankly if i had a lot of money to burn on looking at fine buildings i think i'd most likley keep it and spend it on a National trust membership ticket. See as many fine buildings as i like. All balanced up, same old story, living on ghosts in the corridors, the good old days and the like. Much has now gone. Over priced for average food. I don't think i'd waste my money and go again.",

Starters of veal kidneys, which were fantastic, scallops with black pudding which were beautiful and the dressed crab that was fairly lifeless. Of course a visit to Simpson's would not be worthwhile without the roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. Simply gorgeous. Other mains on our table included the lamb, which was equally as good as the beef, the Wellington which was disappointing and an odd concoction of halibut with spiced lentils and vanilla cream sauce which seemed to work. All washed down with some over priced Rioja. The cheese board was wholly forgettable. Well worth a visit for the food and I guess the surroundings but lunch seems to offer a restaurant floor of whispering businessmen.",

I wouldn't say this was the best restaruant in the world as per ppxxtt above I am sure there are betterbut it is a great restaurant. The grand divan is so lovely - with wooden panelled walls. If you can get a booth, they are great - they seat about 4 - 6 people. We were just 2 but we sat in the middle of the restaurant and on a Saturday night it was so busy! The service was impeccable - such a change in this fastfood world we live in - and the beef was to die for! My only concern was the next table of guests. as my client and I ( it was a business dinner) went to leave and we were leaving a 1/3 of a bottle of wine ( we were both driving), the man on the next table leant across and rather rudely asked us to chuck over the bottle of wine, duck!!!I was so shockedand embarrassed - not the type of clientele you would expect at Simpsons! We did give in and handed over the bottle and then as we left, mentioned this to the maitre d' ( who had been excellent) and he then said he would charge them for the extra wine! Would love to have seen their faces when they came to get the bill!!",

On the first day I arrived in London back in June, 2012, I bought theater tickets for that night so I had to make sure I would make the curtain call.I had no idea where I was going to eat until I stumbled into this restaurant.Upon arrival, I made it known that I had theater ticket and wanted to be sure I would be served in a timely manner. The d\u00e9cor was traditional English--really beautiful--and the wait staff were very kind and accommodating and maybe more so since I dined alone.Since I was pressed for time, it was suggested I should order something from the carving station but I had my heart set on seafood.Lobster was the theme for me that night and to start, I had a lobster bisque--which to this day--is by far the best I've ever had in any city.For my main, I ordered the pan fried ocean trout which was prepared with a lobster sauce/mash & served with potatoes.The delicious white wine I ordered complemented my \u00a0meal perfectly.The delightful English waiters delivered on their promise to serve my meal promptly and I even \u00a0had time to spare.I loved this restaurant (it is quite pricey but worth it) , would recommend it to anyone and will revisit next time I\"m in London.",

Straying from what they do best always runs a small risk on quality, but sticking with the standards is likely not going to disappoint. I've been at least 3 or 4 times over the years & the service has always been excellent... so I'm a little skeptical of the knocks on that in other reviews.",

We opted for the traditional Sunday roast, wheeled about on silver-domed trolleys, and started off with a lobster soup. The Sunday roast was served medium rare with horse-radish, Savoy cabbage (of course) and Yorkshire puddings. \u00a0Everything was impressive and delicious. \u00a0No one was dressed to the nines, but no one looked like slobs, either, so dress appropriately and at least look the part.",

Our waiter informed us that it would take approx. 25 mins to cook our food, but since we weren't starving, we didn't order appetizers to start. There was, of course, bread at the table, but it was very nice of them to bring us an amuse-bouche; a small cup of mushroom soup. It was very tasty and delicious! My steamed sea bass was done very well and had enough flavor that I feel the lemon butter sauce wasn't even needed. The beef wellington was also very good, but not quite the best we have had. The puff pastry was crisp, light and flaky however (as it should be). Our favorite will still be from One if by Land, Two if by Sea in NYC.",

I said that he clearly didn't know us, especially as he offered water to us too. Hence ordering a very nice Australian Shiraz to got with the equally excellent beef. Everyone has written about similar food at the restaurant, and we couldn't find a fault. We selected the option of several dessert tasters. They were all fantastic.

The vast dining room, with its dark wood trim, crystal chandeliers, and gold-toned ceiling, looks like the setting for a film set in the 1930s, and the service is impeccable.To start we shared an order of duck liver pate with mulled pears. For our entrees, we ordered two of their signature dishes, roast rib of beef and roast saddle of lamb. Both were served with roast potatoes and cabbage, and the beef was accompanied by Yorkshire pudding as well. For dessert we had the pudding sampler, which is designed for two people to share.Everything was well-prepared and tasty, but nothing was extraordinary, which it should be when you're paying \u00a385 for lunch.There's a three-course fixed price menu for \u00a329.50 served until 7.00pm, although if you order the roast beef for which they're known, you'll pay a \u00a36.00 supplement. Considering how limited the options for each course are, the slight savings probably isn't worth it.",

    "text": "Simpsons was always one of those places I had on a 'tick list' of places to go but I hadn't expected to do it so informally. Having been to various London sights, we needed to eat before seeing All My Sons and our friends had been there before and recommended it. We phoned and booked a table for 4 people at 5pm - the first sitting on a Saturday which suited us absoutely (I'd never eat that early normally). Arriving before our chaps, we went to the bar upstairs for a G&T. Lovely plump sofas and chairs to sink into and relax; the fact that we were dressed for comfort rather than style was not an issue as I had feared - probably a 'girl' thing. We went to our table just after 5pm and were not the first in the restaurant. The pianist was already playing and there was a long table for a party of about 25 people already placing their orders. Service was super. The guys ordered starters and we girls received a complimentary amuse bouche (sp?) at the same time which was very thoughtful. One of our group had the roast beef and there was loads of it with all the trimmings - a very generous meal with the option of 'seconds' for a small additional fee. All the food was really good, served well and really fresh. The chap on the after dinner drinks trolley is fab! Really passionate about his stuff and very happy to share his expertise and experience - almost a floor show in himself. Having been, I'd be more than happy to continue ticking other places off my list before going back but I'm sure we'll return.",

A bit like being in Mary Poppins thanks to its venerable heritage (there are little fact boards dotted around the foyer) and plethora of aged men working there, it was a real experience. We had a drink in the knights bar (or whatever it's called upstairs first). Bloke's martini came in what looked like a wine glass which he wasn't very partial to and apparently not the best martini he's had. I enjoyed my amaretto sour and would quite have liked another one, but the barman kept on disappearing. Good thing we weren't in a hurry. The dining room was superb though. We had a lovely booth to ourselves, the staff were just the right side of intelligent but butler-ish and the food was incredible. I had the roast, silver platter and all. We shared a half bottle of some pretty phenomenal red and didn't bother with starter or pudding due to the vast quantities of meat we were having. It was pretty terrific meat. Yum. A really memorable meal, stunning room, just don't bother with the bar unless you have a whip or something to stir the barstaff into action.",

The ceremony of the meat carving is fun, a doddery chap wheeled up the meat trolley and carved my tiny lithe friend an enormous slab of meat and added a yorkshire pudding bigger than her head to the plate. No small portions here. The only thing I didn't like is that my main was so big I had no room for pudding and pudding is always the best bit of any meal.",

Their servers have to wear full suits, so they smell like sweat (I don't blame them, they are required to dress like that). It was hotter than outside. It was so stuffy that it was nearly impossible to enjoy the food.The bottle of wine came very warm - yuck! Do they lack refrigerators too perhaps?? The food was very mediocre. The bread that comes with their steak was pretty good. The beef was just OK, nothing special. The duck breast was very mediocre, the skin very chewy. The duck confit meatball was very tasty. The piano music is nice. The building itself is beautiful, but too bad they lack proper air circulation. Overall, bad experience. We regretted wasting a dinner in London at this place. Don't waste your time here, much better places in London.",

This is how I imagine old world posh London was.We went as the finale of our own Sherlock Holmes walking tour (Sherlock's favourite restaurant don't you know?) and it was a lovely way to end the day.We were slightly early for our table so we treated ourselves to cocktails in the bar. It's not cheap at \u00a312.50 per cocktail but they were delicious.The bar was pretty empty though so lacked atmosphere. The restaurant is beautiful and we were treated so kindly by all who served us, without it being pompous.We had gorgeous fish starters; me baked crab which was divine and my date smoked salmon which he said was delicious.We then opted for the signature of the restaurant, the roast beef.It's carved by your table on a huge silver tray, and you can opt for how you'd like your meat still.The portion size was good, the beef accompanied by a huge Yorkshire pudding, a dollop of very tasty horseradish (and I've never liked horseradish before!), roast potatoes and Savoy cabbage.The beef was tender and flavour some. Whilst we ate we listened to the delightful piano playing and people watched as the restaurant filled with an array of diners.It was a very enjoyable experience to eat \u00a0at such a British institution of a restaurant and have such yummy food.It's certainly not cheap, but it's worth it for a special occasion.Sherlock Holmes definitely had good taste!",

    "text": "King Me ImpressedLocated in the posh and historic Savoy building in what once was an opulent chess room, this fine dining restaurant lives up to its grand reputation. Elegantly appointed tables with crisp white linens, wait staff in formal black suits, and even a grand piano with an exceptionally talented pianist, create the perfect ambiance for a memorable evening. The menu is traditional and a bit of a step into the past with classic fare from local game and steaks to fresh wild caught fish. As a starter I enjoyed the Salmon Tartar. \u00a0A beautifully presented medallion of marinated smoked salmon topped with creme fraiche and caviar on a bed of crisp paper thin cucumber slices. While it sounds simple, it was so perfectly dressed that it danced with fresh flavor and finish. One of the best I've ever had. For my main, I had to choose the Lamb Saddle carved table-side on a grand trolley, the likes of which I haven't seen in decades. \u00a0The Chef was a master with a blade that seemed to melt the perfectly roasted meat which was then delicately placed on my plate with a flourish of red currant jelly and a dash of house made mint sauce. Accompanied by twice cooked crisp potatoes and rocket with Stilton dress, this dish prompted thoughts of grander Victorian times when dining was truly a proper experience. \u00a0Lovely, and actually a bit romantic, with the setting and ambiance of the melodic background piano medleys. We finished with a desert tasting that included treacle, lemon square, chocolate mousse and ice cream trio. All delightful. What a wonderful way to make any evening a special occasion.",

I was hesitant to go here because I felt I was not dressed but since it was raining and cold, everyone was wearing jeans and a sweater. It was so interesting to see a lot of people get the roast. It certainly is a sight to behold the chef carving it before you. I had the beef wellington and it was absolutely remarkable from the flaky outside to the demi glac\u00e9 sauce. If I weren't in the presence of others, I would have licked my plate. The portion was on par with having had an appetizer. We also had the scallop appetizer because the welly would take 35 min. I'm not sure what the sauce was, maybe beurre blanc. The scallop was lightly fried. I'm sure there were loads of butter in it but it tasted absolutely divine! We skipped dessert since I couldn't keep my eyes open from so much touring. The ambience was romantic and elegant. I really would have loved to come here in something better than jeans, sweater and sneakers but c'est la vie. This isn't the kind of thing we'd have daily since it tastes too rich with all the butter but it is fabulous to have once a week or so. I'd love to come here several times on our next visit.",

    "text": "I was given a very thoughtful gift from my parents of a carving course at Simpson's, which was a morning of teaching followed by carving roast for your guests at Sunday lunch. My dad did the course about 15 years ago and loved it so it was a really sweet gesture.Unfortunately, things have changed in 15 years. When I was having lunch after, my dad wanted to go over techniques and tricks and it turned out I'd learned barely anything - it has obviously been simplified a lot, and even as I was being taught I was surprised at the lack of detail and even though I don't consider myself to be at all skilled, it did seem like the lesson could have been summed up in 10 minutes. I thought maybe this was just how things are in carving but the fact that my dad was able to talk much more about different appropriate knives and the grain of the meat showed me that I had had a much less rigorous experience. This could also be because there were about 20-25 people at my lesson, whereas my dad was with 8. The cynic in me thinks this has just become a bit of a money spinner.To be honest, though, I would probably have settled for this and been happy enough with a pleasant morning of meat, were it not for two other factors.Firstly, I could neither believe nor stand the casual and continual sexism coming from the so-called master cook. The class was very imbalanced, with only 3 women, and I suspect this is often the case, but we might as well not have been there. The cook addressed us as if we were all men and kept up incessant patter that started off in the world of tired mother-in-law jokes but soon strayed into the more generalised and offensive commentary about how women are bad at cooking (even though the kitchen is our domain) and the suggestions that we are mainly around for the cleaning and the drudge work. It was abhorrent. He would look right through me as he chummily referred to how our wives always overcook meat and nag us to do things too quickly. I felt like I was about a century earlier - which may not be the traditional flavour a top end restaurant should aspire to. Seriously, it made me very uncomfortable and put me on edge, which considering that it's a fairly luxury activity, should never have been allowed to happen.Secondly, it was just poorly organised. This was apparent in the run up, where at different points I had both the wrong date and the wrong number of guests confirmed. But it was also clear on the day. At one point, people were asked to order drinks - which they did, and then were immediately given a complimentary glass of wine, followed by the wine they had just ordered. And frustratingly for me, the class finished at 12:30, while my lunch seating was at 13:45. Now, I understand not everyone can be seated at once, but why wasn't it clear in the details that it would finish earlier? My guests were only arriving for lunch, whereas had I known I would have invited them earlier for a pre-meal drink. Thus I was left along to awkwardly hover and wait for an hour.Obviously, for most of you, you're really only interested in the review of the meal. It's a bit mixed. The meat was certainly delicious (beef or lamb are the best); everything else I had was a bit meh. But the service was truly appalling. We were overcrowded by far too many waiters, but none of them seemed to have been doing the job for more than a few hours. We kept being asked things we had already been asked, we had people lean over us to pass plates along, and there was a particularly odd moment when a man insisted that he was giving my boyfriend his treacle sponge when he was really passing him my chocolate mousse - he evidently didn't know what either looked like. Oh, and my dad was continually addressed as if he was the carver (I mean, he's the man, right, so that makes sense), so we kept having to awkwardly correct them.To finish with, I was presented with a certificate - which I had to point out had a smear of gravy on it.Low, low level of customer service that is particularly infuriating at an establishment that regards itself so highly. Go anywhere else.",

    "text": "This is one of the quintessential old english eateries, founded in 1828 and located on the Strand adjacent to the famous Savoy hotel. Charles Dickens and Vincent Van Gogh (not a typo) sampled fare here historically. It is the second oldest continuous operating restaurant in London ( \"Rules\" being the oldest). Food is served in a classic wood dining room lit by majestic chandeliers, with somewhat annoying piano music being played. \u00a0 Numerous waiters and carvers whisk silver metal domed trolleys full of roast legs of lamb and rib roasts for table side carvery. \u00a0Truly a roll back on how the aristrocratic elite dined 100 years ago. (Ironically, i was dressed in a sports coat and collared shirt and was amply dressed up). The ambiance was thoroughly enjoyable. This aspect of the restaurant is why you go to eat at Simpson In the Strand, as the food \u00a0was good, but nothing spectacular, especially for the price.Before we were seated for our 6:30 pm reservation, we had drinks up at the Simpson tavern first (upstairs) after the maitre'd was kind enough to ask if we preferred to start our meal with a drink , which we did. Four of us, each ordered an unmemorable drink for about \u00a38 ( $12 USD), prior to dinner. \u00a0The seating was comfortable and intimate.For starters (appetizer), I sampled the roast wood pigeon breast with bacon. The meat was cooked a little rare for my liking and even at that it was a bit tough. It consisted of about 3 small bites. Two in our party had the fish cake with chive butter sauce, which was delightful. The other starter a rabbit and crayfish tart was nicely presented in between 2 pastries, but was devoid of shrimp and the flavors didn't seem to mix. We ordered a bottle of NZ white semillon ( \u00a342/$65USD) with our meal.For main course, I ordered the whole dover sole (\u00a335/$54 USD), which was grilled in lemon butter. The sole was fresh and cooked to perfection. It was of ample size and the skin was removed. \u00a0Anyone who likes fish and has never had whole dover sole, you must try it. One of us ordered the roast ribeye (prime rib) accompanied with a yorkshire pudding, roast potatos and savoy cabbage. The meat was sliced table side thinly, not akin to American prime rib, which is served as a tender thick sliced ribeye....this was a bit disappointing, but the portion was adequate, with the starters ordered. The beef wellington was superb served a nice medium, but the fourth meal we ordered, a pan roasted leg of partridge, was disappointing. The partridge was tough. We also ordered shared sides of honey roasted parsnips, cauliflower cheese with bacon, the seasonal greens chile style ( broccolini), along with an order of mash potatos. All sides were superb and nicely presented in copper ramekins.For dessert and apertifs, \u00a0we ordered a cheese plate, 2 person pudding sampler, one house port, and one glass of house red wine. All were unimpressive. We finished our meal with coffees and a pot of tea. Dinner for four with 1 bottle of wine was \u00a3380 or about $580 USD. The ambience at Simpson's is superb and the service attentive, but the food unimpressive. Go there for the historical experience.",

    "text": "So incredibly impressed I am with Simpsons in the Strand. A lovely group of 9 of my friends and I dined at Simpons in the Strand to celebrate a very special birthday last night, and I have not yet stopped thinking about our exquisite meal and exciting and stimulating conversations. It was one of the most amazing dinners I have ever attended, and a large amount of credit is due to Simpons' for this. Walking in, you automatically feel first-class as someone takes your name and another immediately grabs your coat. You watch as other extremely posh people walk in, and you just can't stop admiring them. Simpons' boasts an older crowd with the majority of people aged 50++, most decked in fur coats and dripping in jewels and diamonds. You start to wonder if you are in the right place as you check your outfit and the birth date on your I.D. Once you realize that although you don't exactly fit in, you also realize that you damn well deserve to be there because you are so fabulous in your own right. You strut to the table, sit down on the chair held out for you, and say thank you to the server for placing the napkin on your lap, pouring your water, and placing bread and butter on the table before you can even set your purse down. As we all embraced the comfort of our circle of friends and fill each other in on the latest scoop, we load up on butter and bread... but mainly butter. they start us off with a small cup of creamy soup and then the food comes out, altogether, which makes all the difference to me. I look down at my plate, and I immediately get aroused. I look to my right, left, and across the table and realize that everyone's dish looks outstanding. We begin to eat, rave about our food, and proceed to pass small bites of our own dishes across the table for everyone to taste. Combined, our table ordered the stuffed pork tenderloin, the roast beef, the lamb, and the beef wellington. Everything - I mean everything - was extremely moist and flavorful. Although everything was noteworthy, there were some dishes better than the rest. I'm not a wishy-washy person and I can always choose something over another, which is why I'll tell you now which dishes you cannot leave without trying. Please please please do yourself a favor and order the roast saddle of lamb and the beef wellington. They are incredibly thoughtful and delicious dishes, and they will inspire you.4-6 bottles of wine and an assortment of desserts later, we leave fully satisfied and the birthday boy is in bliss.",

Simpson's did not disappoint him! I do wish the website encouraged \"nice\" dress even if jacket not required. We had on jeans and sweatshirts due to weather and I felt very underdressed in the stunning, old setting. We were told this was the second oldest restaurant in London. Spectacular room! The food is fresh and delicious! The roast beef was cooked to perfection. His only complaint was he got full! One small incident was corrected quickly without any hesitation. Wonderful service! Highly recommend! (And wear the nice clothes you brought! )",

    "text": "I first dined at Simpson's November 2015. I was in London - with a friend born and raised in the city - so why wouldn't I want to try the best place serving Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. Simpson's. Just for a bit of history - I'm a huge fan of Roast Beef, Yorkshire pudding and the fixings. Growing up we had an awesome babysitter who came from London. She didn't have any children and we became her surrogate kids. On occasion she would make dinner for us. And when she did she would make this traditional British meal. So I grew up with a proper Roast Beef and Yorkshire pudding meal. In fact - as an adult - I make this meal myself for Holidays and special occasions. I use my babysitters recipe and it is consistently awesome!!!! \u00a0My kids love it. So I am a tough customer when it comes to this meal. When we visited Simpson's the first time in November of 2015 I was really impressed. They walked around the restaurant with a carving station so you could get the perfect slice of beef! \u00a0The restaurant is very old school and exactly what you would expect from a local spot specializing in this meal. Staff super friendly and accommodating. We revisited Simpson's last month. After a 6 month renovation. They have maintained all the goodness. In particular the sides are fantastic. Roasted potatoes and fries are stellar. Mac n' Cheese and many other apps fantastic! \u00a0The only criticism I have is the Yorkshire Pudding. It's fine but not what I'm used to or how I make it. My Yorkshire Pudding is golden and crispy on the outside and edges but actually moist and pudding like on the center. Simpson's is very crusty, dark brown and fairly dry. Good. But not - to me a traditional Yorkshire Pudding. I asked the waiter for a less cooked piece and he said that a 'proper' Yorkshire Pudding is cooked well and dark and crusty..... \u00a0I prefer the way I make it!Either way. We will be back!",

He wanted a traditional welsh dinner which is typically served on Sunday, but we weren't in London on Sunday and Simpson's was one of only a few who have a traditional roast beef meal during the week.They have a carving station that is cut table side. I ordered the welsh lamb and he ordered the roast beef. The portions are perfect, they cover the plate entirely with meat, for me lamb with mint sauce and gravy. For my fianc\u00e9 roast beef and gravy. The sides are then served, which were wonderful. With my lamb I had potatoes o gratin and green beans. For the roast beef, he had carrots and the biggest piece of Yorkshire pudding we've ever seen.We were too full for dessert but they brought out a small dessert for us anyway. Apricot jelly cubes, after 8 mints and fudge. The atmosphere was wonderful and so was the service and food! When I return to London, I'll be sure to go back! Make sure to make a reservation as they are quite busy!",

I had shrimps on toast for starter then mussels for main. I must admit, their seafood dishes weren't the best I had. Some of the mussels weren't very fresh, and I thought the base broth could have been better. Next time, I think I'll try more of the red meat dishes. Obviously, that's what this place is known for anyway. Service was overall solid. They promptly topped up our water glasses throughout the dinner and had a great friendly attitude. Ambience was excellent. Quintessentially British and posh, but not overly done. Would love to go back to try out more of their dishes.",

There is something magical about walking into a dining room that once served Charles Dickens and hasn't changed much since.While the menu is pricey, they are offering a Groupon which is an amazing deal: two courses per person and wine for \u00a339 total. Your mains are either the roast beef or lamb, but considering the a la carte prices for each of those mains is over \u00a330 each, you realize what a tremendous bargain this deal is. The food was very good, and very classic British. The roast beef was tender, and the sides of cabbage, potatoes, and Yorkshire pudding were all done nicely. There is something so neat about being served tableside from a silver trolley. We chose desserts instead of starters for our second course, and thought they were lovely. My treacle sponge was easily one of the best desserts I had while touring the UK, and the sticky toffee pudding was quite nice was well.Service was pretty good. The staff were warm, welcoming, and attentive. Our server was a little slow (sides coming a few minutes after the mains, slow to bring pepper, etc.), but he was very nice. I would definitely dress nicely to come here. I wore nice wool trousers and a button down shirt and felt quite comfortable, but you could be equally comfortable in a suit and tie if you wanted. The only person I saw wearing jeans was a tacky American who was eating his Yorkshire with his hands like it was a baguette.",

    "text": "Three stars, that got you looking. The room is classic. It is the classic restaurant serving the Sunday joint done up fancy. However, compared to the modern incarnations in the States like Lawrys and The Prime Rib, it pales in comparison. Live piano music in the background. The music was the right volume and tempo, but it was odd to hear \"House of the Rising Sun\" being played.Service was generally excellent, although they had trouble keeping water in the glass. At the price point, and the length of time they've been doing things, it should be perfect. Perhaps it was perfect in the 50's and 60's, but it doesn't match what others are doing. It doesn't really seem to matter how you ask for the prime rib, they just slice it off the end they are working from. I asked for rare. I always ask for that knowing it's going to be medium rare, but it gives them the hint I want the meat from the middle, not the ends where it's more cooked. Unfortunately, I hit them when they were working from the end on a new piece. Indeed when they got to another table later asking for medium, they got the medium rare from the middle since that's where they were at.The horseradish isn't very good. The yorkshire pudding and roasted potatoes were very good. The cabbage, OK. All in all, OK food at best for the price. Good service. A spectacular room.",

    "text": "Based on reviews of friends and what we've read on Yelp we were looking forward to our dinner at Simpsons. \u00a0This restaurant has definite strengths as supported by other reviews. But, our daughter was served a rancid (and i mean rancid as in \"reeked of freaking putridness\" rancid) flank steak that has spoiled our opinion. \u00a0The server quickly replaced her meal and explained that the chef said the 45 day aging of the meat can create a smell that some people are not accustomed to. \u00a0Anyways, in my life as a carnivore I've never tried a piece of meat that I needed to spit out, let alone gag out. \u00a0That a rotten (and by rotten I don't mean \"slightly bad\" I mean smelled like you shoved your face in a garbage dump) \u00a0piece of meat be served in a steakhouse is totally unacceptable. \u00a0It was bad enough that the meat was literally a piece of feces, but then they tried to cover it up by acting like it was our problem because we didn't understand their \"aging\" process. Of course the server smelled it and wouldn't take a bite.",

We both chose the beef which came with cooked spinach, roasted potatoes and Yorkshire pudding. All were done well but in typical English fashion done without and \"flair\". The atmosphere was out of a time machine. The pianist played every cliche song imaginable and the decor was 1950 something. I'm not saying it was bad it was just.......... predictable.",
