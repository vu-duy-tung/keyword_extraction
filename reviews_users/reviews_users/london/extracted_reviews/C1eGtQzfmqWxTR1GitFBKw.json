It should be easy to make what is essentially junk food palatable, but the burgers and fries were bland. The milkshakes rely heavily on bog-standard ice cream.

The food is great for what it is-- simple burgers and fries. It's very indulgent and afterwards you go into a food coma, but that comes with the territory of fast food. The milkshakes are fabulous-- peanut butter is amazing. They use a nice rich peanut butter but don't make the shake sickingly sweet or too nutty. Subtle and creamy. As an American in London, it's good for a laugh to come here once in a while.",

I now normally have dinner else where then go to ED's for desert, either a milk shake or the Kit Kat Sundae which is just ice cream, Kit Kat sticks, cream, chocolate power.oh its just amazing! I love the place, just not for burgers. Please ED improve your burgers. Oh one more thing to add is the price. Roughly \u00a315 a head and for the kind of burgers you get and chip portion that's expensive. Although service here is always with a big smile. Even from the door man!",

In terms of food quality however, I wasn't very impressed and could have probably eaten a better meal at MacDonald's or dare I say it, Burger King.If you're watching the calories there isn't really any safe option so probably stick with the water or diet coke. Everything is deep fat fried meaning that it tends to be on the greasy side (I did say think 'Grease') \u00a0I opted for a cheese burger after an alcohol fuelled evening when I would be less cautious of the whole unhealthy thing, but still struggled with the burger as it was just far too greasy .The milkshakes are great though and you would probably struggle to find better. These tend to be very popular and what Ed's is famous for. You should go to experience the American style vibe and Rock 'n' Roll jukebox but don't expect an amazing quality meal.",

    "text": "Two stars may sound harsh (especially since I'm normally quite generous with my ratings), but the more I think about my visit to Ed's Diner the more bad stuff I seem to remember! Having recently returned from a holiday to the States I was on the hunt for a milkshake. But not just any old milkshake - specifically a 'chocolate peanut butter malt' which I had fallen in love with during my trip. I'd been reliably informed that Ed's was the place to go for this so a few of us headed there one Saturday lunchtime to try them out. The staff were very friendly when we walked in, but as soon as we said we were mainly interested in milkshakes we were informed in no uncertain terms that, since there was no room at the counter to sit down for a quick drink, we'd have to sit in a booth and ALL OF US had to order food as well as drinks (personally, I think calling their milkshakes a 'drink' is a bit rich since they probably contain more calories than a three course meal, but anyway). Well, we were a bit peckish, so after being reminded that we'd HAVE TO SPEND AT LEAST \u00a320 ON FOOD ALONE we sat down, feeling ever so slightly under pressure to order more than we'd like to. Well that didn't turn out to be a problem because, crikey, the food wasn't cheap. Knowing that my milkshake was probably going to keep me going for the rest of the day I went for the 'light' option of a caesar salad. My friends ordered burgers and, although they insisted that they were fine, to be honest they didn't look much bigger or nicer than what you'd get in McDonalds. And they were about \u00a37 without chips. We ordered glasses of water, but that never arrived so we had to remind them (since milkshakes aren't all that hydrating), and when they eventually arrived the water was lukewarm. Then they took our chips away before we'd even finished them. Oh, and my salad had a really funny aftertaste, and the jukebox wasn't working. But Oh My God, the milkshakes. They were awesome. And huge. You could blatantly share one between two, but if you can't finish it you can take the leftovers away with you in a paper cup. So thumbs up for the milkshakes, but massive thumbs down for pretty much everything else I'm afraid.",

    "text": "No. No no no no no.NO.Ed's does a couple of things marginally right, and everything else spectacularly, gloriously wrong.The shakes are good. They might seem a bit pricy on the menu, but you get two big glasses-worth and they're sufficiently authentic. That said, it is quite hard to balls up a milkshake.On to the wistfully bad.The burgers are extremely average. They're not bad per se, but for \u00a35-8 they're poor. The bun was stale, the meat bland and slightly overdone; overall it was a dry, arid, unpleasantly memorable mouthful.But that's not the worst of it.The fries are bad on an epic scale.Firstly, they're not fries, they are chips. Big, fat, greasy, imposing chips, like the kind you had at school on a friday lunchtime.So the 'chilli cheese fries' are a bowl of fatty chips, a dollop of that weird reconstituted cheese sauce (which only works with nachos) and some chilli. Not what you'd expect.The service is pleasant enough but the delivery does kind of spoil the illusion of being across the Atlantic.Bearing in mind the location of Ed's, (wodged onto the side of the Trocadero, in that unpleasant sliver between Piccadilly and Leicester Sq which can cause the sane to turn suicidal), you'd be much better off going to TGI Friday's across the road. Seriously.Or better yet, trek North for about ten minutes and go to Bodean's.I won't be going back.",

'be right with you, ' he shouted and continued to clear. for another 5 min. really?! yeah. my boyfriend and i raised our eyebrows but dealt. \u00a0we sat at the counter and waited slightly forever just to get offered water. we quickly ordered - chocolate shake, cheese burger, chicken club, onion rings - and then waited. and waited. food came - but still no sign of shake. my chicken club was what it was. not amazing but hit the spot enough, although the actual chicken was kind of sparse, to be honest. the burger was over cooked and really bland. and the buns on both were tastless and slightly stale. a bit like cardboard. and finally the shake. too runny and not blended all the way through.the waiter, bless him, once we got past everything else, was actually really cool. you could tell he loved his job and wanted to do well. and had a sweet outgoing \u00a0american personalily.but over all. no thanks. i'll just stick with the soho location next time.",

Rock'n'roll hits belt out of the jukebox and your food is served either at the 'bar' or while sat in the red leather-festooned booths. Fries steeped in garlic sauce, large burgers, hot dogs, caesar salads and even larger burgers are on the unchanging menu. Combined with the late openings, this is good food for soaking up those alcohol units before facing the night bus home. One could say that the experience is little more than eating in a trussed-up Macky D's with some retro gloss - and you'd be right. Prices are high and quality is erratic - try the chocolate malt but avoid getting the synthetic-tasting blue cheese topping on your burger. But there's a definite fun element at Ed's which is lacking from the more classical fast food experience.",

The good points just are not enough to outweigh the bad points. The most important aspect, of course, to any meal out is the food! This is a hamburger joint so being the signiture menu item you would expect to get a great burger - especially since my big king cost me 7 pounds and that's with out fries... This isn't a cheap place to eat at all. They also add 12.5 percent to your bill. The burger was crap. You can get a better burger at burger king. The menu makes it sound like the burgers are made fresh, but on actually paying attention to it they don't actually say any such thing. From the texture the burgers are obviously frozen mass produced burgers. They taste exactly like the ones you get in Witherspoon pubs which makes me think they might order from the same catering company. I know a good fresh 100 percent home made burger when I taste one because I make them myself at home all the time. All in all I really wouldn't recommend this place at all. Go to Burger King or even McD you will get a better buger at a a 1/3 of the price...",

Staff gestured at a couple who were seated and told that would be the table we would have once they left, they guessed around 10mins. I enquired why we had to wait when there was clearly seats available and the host told us it was for large parties only (5) and as there was only two of us we'd have to wait. I told him I felt that was pretty unfair we'd have to stand and wait for someone to finish when there were seats available. Spoke to the 'manager' who told me its company policy to reserve the largest table for big parties only. What a load of horse crap, its purely their greed. We were the only ones waiting and no large parties were hankering for the table! According to another earlier review I am not the only person who has encountered their greed. Anyway we left and walked to the one in central Soho (which is tiny by the way) It only has seats at the bar so space is an issue but nobody is discriminated against if they arrive in smaller parties and you can sit wherever you please.So, they lost our trade (FYI 'manager' if you are reading we had 2xBurger combos, 2xshakes, 1 soft drink, and a Bud. Thats a fair amount of trade you lost just incase a party of 5 walked in! With any luck your silly company policy will deter enough people you will go bankrupt in no time!",

I might be picky and I might have been to one too many diners but gave this one a shot because my husband had good memories of the place and they have a GF bun for burgers which is always a plus.Yes, we did go during lunch time but there was absolutely no need to be ignored the second we received our meals. It was impossible to get the check and once we did, it was again impossible to pay because the waiters just didn't seem to pay any attention to us.Food-wise- the regular fries were completely undercooked and my crispy chicken burger had enough mayo to make a whole potato salad- unnecessary and kinda gross.. If we weren't in a rush- after waiting for over 30min I would have asked to exchange it..Nothing much to brag about.. The decor was nice and kitschy..",

I'd highly recommend signing up for an Ed's card (it's free) as you get a free shake for your birthday, free burger on the anniversary you signed up, 50% off vouchers straight to your mailbox every couple of weeks, plus you earn points each time you eat there which can then be redeemed for money off your next visit. I usually get the chicken dippers mainly because their jalape\u00f1o jelly that comes with it is just divine! The sweet potatoes are very yummy, and so are their shakes. They've recently released a new flavour - Biscoff Lotus! This is a great place for a pre theatre meal!",

I mean they are really working it with this one .. I have to say though.... The last time I went they didn't cook the onion properly and so I basically had a full crunchy onion with very little batter .. But you know what? No one likes a moaner so I'll let that slide .. Their milkshakes are great though! Hugeeeeeeeeeeeeee .. I come away feeling good about myself",

There was a guy at the next table who was telling the staff that he worked in another Ed's location.He was given A1 service and I was virtually ignored for my visit. More importantly, the portion size was absolutely appalling.I am not a fan of coleslaw and asked for it to be held. The server said he would ask the chef to put more chips on the plate. Well he might have asked, but the chef didn't take a lot of notice. So a tiny portion of COLD limp chips is what arrived. The bun for the hotdog was stale.However the guy from the other restaurant had his piled up and it looked good.Won't be going back to this diner.",

We decided to share: - the Cheese or Cheese burger with fries, onion rings, and cole slaw for 9.45- oreo shake- A&W Root BeerWe wolfed everything down and kept raving about how great everything was. \u00a0But in hindsight, I don't think I would come back here again for their burgers. \u00a0It was the atmosphere that kept things fun, but the food is nothing to rave about. The burger is OK, but quite standard. \u00a0The fries / onion rings / cole slaw - soggy, bland, and a waste of space! \u00a0There's really nothing much more I can say about the burger itself. \u00a0It's not a massive burger, and there was really nothing that special about it!The shake - yes, its good. \u00a0But Byron does it better.A&W Root Beer - imported from America. \u00a0A&W has its own chains through America, and there's also a separate unrelated branch in Canada - the A&W root beer in Canada is definitely superior, not being biased as I've tried both (and as I frequent the states, I had several opportunities to stock up on this if I liked it).Would i go back? Nope. For 9.45, is the burger meal worth it? \u00a0For a mediocre burger with a soggy mess of chips, onion rings and cole slaw.. nope.",

You can either have your meal solo or as a plate including main , fries, onion rings and coleslaw, great for those with smaller appetites who might not want the whole shebang! The atmosphere at Ed's is really nice too with the place mostly filled with families enjoying an old-fashioned American meal and music from the 50\u2032s. I was sat up on the bar rather than taking up a whole table and there were mini jukeboxes where you could select a song to play for 20p proceeds from which go to Action Hunger which I thought was a really nice touch. It's a place I keep returning to again and again.",

    "text": "Went there last night with a friend, as we couldn't decide what to eat. She spotted the sign of \"Ed's\" in big red letters. I thought, yeah we can have a look as we are so undecided about what to eat while walking around aimlessly for about an hour. I had the Cheese or Cheese with chips and a drink. One thing I found weird was, the chips came out first in a bowl. I was not expecting this, I was expecting them to come out with the burger, but I made them last. They were chunky chips (Usually I hate chunky chips) and they were as crisp as anything, I loved em. The burger came out, didn't look anything hugely impressive, but for what it was, I was stuffed from it's warm and tastyness. It didn't look much, but it did taste good, it reminded me of the good old days of the \"wimpy\" chain. The look of this place looked like what I'd imagine an olden styled American diner would look like. Imagine the scene from the film \"Paul\" where they go into that diner and get that UFO ice cream, something like that. It was nice, as I was even swaying to the music, the atmosphere of that place was amazing. I don't usually go in, sit down and start moving my head with the music. The waiter saw me and laughed as he saw me, not a mocking laugh though. I can't remember his name, but he was awesome. Overall this place was easily a 10/10, the reason I chose 4 stars though, was I had to pay 2.95 extra for chips, when usually they come with the burger. I will be coming back here again in the future with ease.",

    "text": "+ great milkshake+ American diner decor- terrible service- terrible food- terrible value for moneyI went to Ed's Diner with a friend for a quick dinner before watching a show at a nearby theatre on a weeknight. The place looks the part of an American diner, but other than that everything about it was pretty terrible. I grew up in California so when I think American diner, Mel's Drive-In sets the normal standard. Ed's Diner has a similar feel - a bit brighter than I would like but it's got the right colours and decor. I had a chili dog and my friend ordered a classic burger, which sat lonely and limply on large, white plates when they arrived at our table. My chili dog was bland and lukewarm, and for the c.\u00a36 paid, I would rather have had a McDonald's burger. We also had a side of fries, which as other reviewers have commented, were indeed English chips and not \"American fries\" as expected from an American diner. Because my friend and I had a bit of time to kill before the show started that evening, we took our time nibbling the remaining chips. The place, by the way, was not packed; there were no queues of diners and in fact empty tables surrounded us. Yet, the waiter kept trying to take our bowl of chips away, and even attempted to take away my friend's bottle of unfinished beer as we sat chatting away. The waiter came around at least 4 times attempting to take away our unfinished food, even though we were clearly still nibbling away. I can understand this kind of haste in a packed venue with a long queue of hungry, impatient diners, but the place was empty and it wasn't hurting their business that we sat there an extra 15 minutes - at least we were \"advertising\" to passerbys that perhaps the food is edible in this establishment. The only redeeming feature of this venue was the milkshake, which was full and creamy, but that alone cannot excuse the bad food and bad service from Ed's Diner at the West End. For the money, I would rather go to McDonald's for a more authentic version of American burgers and fries.",
