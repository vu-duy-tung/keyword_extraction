When I finally exhausted the recommendations of friends, I went in search of something undeniably delicious that I knew wouldn't disappoint me and I wound up in Chinatown, in a well reviewed restaurant, where they waste very little time on decor and atmosphere and they spend all their time on what's important. Roasted Duck.Simply food. Walk in, sit down, order half a duck with white rice, sit, and feast. The skin was crispy and fatty, the meat was tender and plentiful. I could not have asked for more on a rainy London day.",

The food however makes up for most of the crappy service. I recommend the boneless ROAST DUCK. The sweet soy sauce just PERFECTION drizzled on. Every time I'm in town I stop by Four Seasons. Though, if you do takeaway they don't give you the veggies that comes with the order when you eat in :( I'm a bit sad when i found that out. If you're bringing buggies you might be yelled at since the restaurant is small, which is really RUDE. I still have to give a 4 for that duck, coz even LA's chinatown got this beat from the get go. :)",

    "text": "\"Do you like duck?\" \u00a0This was the question that was asked of me (quite randomly I might add) by my friend while I was visiting him in London. \u00a0I do happen to be a fan of duck, so when he recommended we go to the Four Seasons in Chinatown, I was all for it!The place is fairly small and looks like most Chinese places I've been to. \u00a0There were seven in our group so we were sat at one of the larger tables in the back that have rotating glass in the center (very good for family style sharing). \u00a0Since my friend had been here before, we let him do most of the ordering.We started with hot and sour soup (one of my personal favorites) which was much spicier than what I've had here in the States. \u00a0I'm a huge fan of spicy food so that was no problem for me! \u00a0We then moved into our main courses of whole roasted duck and BBQ duck, both of which were absolutely delicious. \u00a0The whole duck came with thin tortilla-like wraps that we used with veggies and sauces to make our own duck wraps. \u00a0I'm not such a fan of the BBQ duck as it's a little fatty for my liking.We also had a shrimp dish which was pretty yummy. \u00a0For whatever reason, someone thought it would be a good idea to order Lychee wine.....yeeeaaaahhhh....not the best. \u00a0It was way too sweet, strong, and just overall not good. \u00a0Wouldn't recommend it.For dessert we had just plain old Lychee which WAS delicious. \u00a0Those sweet little balls made my mouth very happy (that's what she said). \u00a0When you're done with your entire meal, they bring you oranges (kind of like an after dinner mint).The service wasn't too bad. \u00a0It was a little slow at times and one of the smaller dishes we ordered never made it to our table, but they were very nice about taking it off our bill. \u00a0Overall, I would have to agree with the masses and say that they have the best duck around.",

I think it's because I always get lost and have had one to many bad experiences of all you can eat buffets served in a trough! I want to be one of those people that can navigate themselves round windy streets and no the best place to get Crispy Duck and any time of day or night. Alas, I am not... until now. OK, so there wasn't much street winding going on considering Gerrard Street is the main street in China Town but none the less I am now quietly confident I can challenge any China Town veteran to the 'best duck ever' stakes. I came to meet my boyfriend and his Mum here, the previous night we had had a fight, now I was running late and screaming down the phone because I was lost. The ambiance was not great. No matter, once I got into the restaurant the waiters were so friendly and instinctively poured me a glass of wine that I suddenly began to feel more relaxed. There was no pressure to hurry in this place which I think is one of the most important things. We were able to order our Duck and starters and take our time over them. The Duck was as good as I have ever had, really meaty, we ordered a half and we got a big half! After a leisurely start we were obliged to order mains, even though we were actually all full. Ordered was: Mixed Seafood and Noodle Soup, I thought this tasted like pond water but everyone else seemed to like it, weird! Salt and Pepper Squid, this was amazing. Best I've had in a Chinese restaurant. The batter was really light and crispy with just the right amount of chili's, there was way to much for one person but I didn't let it stop me. There was also Sweet & Sour Pork and King Prawns with seasonable vegetables. I presume these were also both delicious as I didn't get a look in. For the four of us with 3 bottles of wine, duck, starters and mains it came to just over \u00c2\u00a3100.",

I'm not too sure it's the best in the world but it's the best I've had in London and on par with the roast duck I had at the considerably more upscale Peninsula Hotel in Beijing. One piece of advice based on my experience at Four Seasons: forego the rest of the menu and just order the duck. Everything I've tried on the menu is pretty good but nowhere near as good as the duck. Besides there are plenty of other decent Chinese restaurant around Chinatown.",

    "text": "Over many visits to this Chinatown staple I have sampled many of their excellent dishes and I can honestly say that I have never once been disappointed. Four Seasons is known for their barbecued meats and for good reason. Their Peking Duck is succulent and tasty. I also have their Crispy Aromatic duck which is very flavourful and crispy- the most perfect incarnation of this dish that I have ever had. In terms of other starters I have had the Peking Dumplings (strong flavour and very 'juicy') and Vegetarian Spring Rolls (Crispy with a high amount of vegetables inside). In terms of Main Course I have a group of dishes which are some of my favourites in the world. The Pork chop in honey and pepper sauce (from the Chef's Specials) is delicious, the pork chops are always flavoursome with a crispy exterior, the sauce is absolutely delicious and sweet with an almost caramel texture this combined with chopped up onions makes an absolutely stunning dish. The Black Bean dishes are also very good. The Beans themselves are as tasteful as ever and are slightly soft as (in my opinion they should be) and with a kick of chili it is very good. I would recommend the Beef in Black Bean sauce rather than the pork as the Pork is sometimes a tad too fatty for me. The Singapore Noodles are also very good with another hit of Chili to add to the flavour. As someone who is a huge fan of Mushrooms the Chicken with Chinese and Straw mushrooms is delicious and always comes with a hearty helping of various Mushrooms. The straw mushrooms are especially delicious!! Even though I have visited many times and have eaten many dishes there, there are still loads of dishes I want to try, the Fish dishes will be next I think. Anyway it has a great range of dishes at very competitive prices; we spent about \u00a325 a head and had more food than we could eat. The only negative for some people may be the service. It is not always particularly efficient and/or 'chatty' but thats exactly what gives this place it's authentic charm.Overall:Price: Very good for the volume of food (Around \u00a315-25 a head)Favourite Item: Pork Chop in Honey and Pepper Sauce.Worst Aspect: I honestly cannot name one.Would recommend? Definitely I plan to go back as soon as possible.",

Recently I took my girlfriend for the first time and it was a pretty good experience, \u00a0endulging in the world famous Peking duck, \u00a0crispy pork belly, \u00a0soft shell crab and yummy noodles and rice. We were seated quickly and the experience was noisy but enjoyable. But somehow the noise adds the feeling of a bustling busy restaurant which is fine... So we went back a week later. And.... I don't think a restaurant could drop the ball any further... And they weren't even as busy as usual.... Maybe that's a sign of the times. After 40 minutes we received our duck pancakes, \u00a0the duck was nice but seemed to be dry from sitting out too long, \u00a0then..... Nothing.... 20 mins later we received cold soft shell crab.... Ten minutes later Kung Po... Very tasty.... But cold.... No rice.... 10 mins later... Rice.... What's the point No apology just an interest to take money and run. Also the pricing is higher than most Chinese restaurants so we left feeling like we paid for their reputation not there service and sadly not their food. We won't be going back. There's plenty more tables in London serving exotic Cantonese wonderment.",

Wife was craving noodles and after some really bad ramen at Wagamama (we went there because it was close to our hotel and we didn't want to travel far. Now we know to never go!) So she looked up Yelp and she decided to give this place a shot. We arrived before dinner rush and there were already people waiting. Since we were a small group, we were promptly seated in the basement section. My wife ordered her noodles, a tofu with veggies, the mixed plate of duck and pork. Its decent Chinese food. We did order the famous duck that everyone is raving about and its good - I have to give it to them, but its not \"the best I had\" kinda good. Think HK, NY, or SF! Maybe its consider the best in UK (maybe Europe)?The pork was not as good because it got soggy from soaking in the soy sauce mixed in with the duck. The surprise was the tofu veggie that I really liked. Sorry - I don't know the official English name because the server recommended it in Cantonese. Anyways, I think this restaurant is decent. Wouldn't mind going back again if I was craving Chinese food in London.",

But all of above combined left me fuming.I visited Four Seasons on a busy Friday night with the missus and after a short wait we were seated. Not much to say about the interior or staff, so we promptly ordered our food.Starters were brought out after the Mains. Our Roast Duck was tepid, and judging by the sauce that had dried on the plate it had clearly been sitting out far before we had arrived. When we explained that it was cold, they took it away and warmed it up in the microwave, my initial bite mark that returned with the dish proved this.Terrible all around. Your better off ordering from your local Chinese takeaway.",

It also meets the service standards, but this is the kind of place you simply go to only for the food, not necessarily for the \"restaurant-experience\" (this is not a place to dress up for a Saturday night).Their roast duck, pork belly, soya chicken (in that order) are all fantastic, you can have a meat selection but make sure you order enough duck. We ordered the beef noodles and Singapore fried vermicelli with it and these are equally great. Whether you're new to the Cantonese kitchen or have high expectations, this is the place to go to!",

My partner and I were sat downstairs in a small white box of a room, packed with tables and customers. This I can deal with, but when the number of patrons impacts the service I start to become wary.My meal was excellent, tasty and felt authentic. However the venue for the meal lacked any ambiance or class.I came here because of the good reviews, and my food lived up to them. The over-all experience though was tainted by the lack of ambience and friendly service. Don't get me wrong - the service was good. I just wasn't classy enough to make me smile.In a nutshell, if you want tasty Chinese food in Chinatown you can get it here. If you want a more pleasing environment in which to experience it go elsewhere!",

    "text": "This is my other half's favourite haunt for roast duck. It's not hard to see why as their Bayswater branch is famous for it, they have won countless awards (and glued these to their window and walls, including newspaper clippings for you to read while you wait!)A quick summary before we begin:- If you want tasty roast duck, come here. If you want excellent service to go with it, please look elsewhere because you will not find it here.To elaborate, the roast duck is the juiciest duck you will ever taste. Sometimes it may be overly fatty but the fat is what makes it taste so good. The soya sauce that comes with it is really sweet and I can only imagine the amount of sugar that has gone into it. However, I cannot complain as I have a sweet tooth and generous helpings of this sauce with the roast duck makes me a happy bunny.I usually get the roast duck for takeaway to eat at home, unfortunately the price has gone up recently, it's around \u00a318.50 for a whole roast duck. If you are ordering takeaway please ignore the queue outside and just go straight to the till to order. Sometimes if you come really late in the night (I actually mean 9pm) they would have sold out of roast ducks. Have no fear, they opened another branch about 3 min walk away down the end of Gerrard Street, at Wardour Street. They usually have a few roast duck hanging up even though this branch has run out.Onto the issue of service. Inevitably you will see a queue start forming here as early as 6pm. The restaurant is tiny and there are just too many people trying to eat here all the time that you end up freezing outside while you wait. If you do manage to get a table, you will get one of these two:- get ignored by the waiter for refills of drinks, or get hurried by the waiter to pay up and leave so they can sit someone else down. If you are lucky you will get both treatments!Tip: maybe stick with takeaways and cook your own rice at home!",

If you're a meat fan, order the sample plate where you get the BBQ pork, soy sauce chicken, duck, and fatty pork. It's incredible... my favorite is the first three because the fatty pork can be dry sometimes. The noodle dishes (stir-fried rice noodles with beef) are a must, and their seafood (pineapple shrimp) is not bad either. Be wary of the waiters though because if they think you're tourists, they will try and get more tip by falsely claiming their added service charge is for the government, not for the restaurant... completely absurd. I was a bit insulted but it hasn't happened again and the food is so good, so I will definitely go back here.",

When we sat down as well, no one offer any tea or drinks to us - which is typical in a Chinese restaurant- and the attitude is horrendous. When we were ready to order the waiters just ignored us and carry on to talk instead of coming over and help us. When we trued to order more plain boiled rice, they \"forgot\" and we had to ask them again before giving us the rice. The most disgusting thing is that they charge a compulsory 12.5% service charge and even ask for more tips at the end. Why would we pay any tips for the appalling services they gave us?",

Many of us tried the same things, but there are some things that I have had at this restaurant that stand out as being the best Chinese I've ever had in my life. We all split the duck with the pancakes. I was quite hesitant to try duck, as I never have been fortunate enough to see this variety in my daily diet. It was amazing! The pancakes (of course, I had not known what this was since Americans have a different cultural knowledge of pancakes) complemented the appetizer so well, that I wanted more! But I'm really glad we didn't. Our main course came, and we all sampled the variety of duck and chicken in many different sauces: sweet and sour, orange, and kong-po. I know there were some other dishes that were ordered, but I do not recall at the current moment. We had visited here on our first day in London, and decided we loved it so much that we made reservations for the last day. What a great decision! When I come back to you one day, London, I will enjoy this wonderful restaurant again!",

The waitress was very rude from the off, asking us what we wanted after literally only just sitting down. When she did take our order she was very blunt which set the precedent for the rest of the night.On arrival we all remarked how little meat there was on the duck and even double checked it was in fact a whole duck, to which she replied it was. The duck ended up being about 2 legs worth of (lukewarm) meat, the rest was just skin and a base of prawn crackers which were used to pad the dish out.Waitress collected plates as people were still eating, poured most of the wine down the side of the glass/on the table, and didn't say thank you to any member of the party after paying our \u00a3170 bill.TL;DR - Rude servers, expensive food, small portions.

Food wise, the actual food wasn't bad, although I realise now that we stupidly ordered crispy duck when we should have gone for their famous roast duck...oh well. The real problem was that should have come first but instead they brought out our brisket stew, with no rice, so it went cold while we waited. Then the pork we ordered actually arrived cold, and had to be sent back. Duck arrives at this point. We ordered more rice but that never turned up (nor on the bill, which was something). Overall, very poor service and I think that's the first time I've ever had to send something back to the kitchen to be heated. I would hesitate to come again, even though I'd like to try the proper duck!",

My friend and I were looking to grab a simple dinner in Chinatown, and when I looked up restaurant reviews, they were all around 3.5 stars out of 5 and I wondered how they could have all been so poor. There is nothing that is 4 stars or above. I've been here a few times to get barbecued meat or roast duck for takeaway, which somehow always managed to set me back \u00a310-15, but it's well regarded for having the best roast duck in London and the char siu and crispy pork belly was always solid too. It's expensive, but on the bright side it's the same price to eat in, so that is probably the best option at this restaurant. The other items on the menu were outrageously expensive - the highlight was that plates of seasonal vegetables will send you back \u00a39, when clearly the cost at the supermarket next door would be something like \u00a32. We got stir fried prawns with seasonal vegetables (which turned out to be broccoli, not even anything special) for \u00a310, but at least there were prawns. We also got the crispy duck with pancakes, which was nice because we could order \u00bc duck, which you can't with the Peking duck, but the crispy duck was a dry, shredded, indistinguishable version of the normal glazed and juicy roast duck glory. I wouldn't recommend it. The table next to us got the Peking duck and I had serious food envy. Our last dish was the young chow fried rice. The disappointing part about this was that it was served lukewarm. The whole meal costs us nearly \u00a340 in total, which is terrible value and you should definitely be able to do much better in Chinatown. I might come here for the barbecued meat or roast duck takeaway, but it's not worth your while to eat in.",

Four Seasons was recommended to us by a friend for good crispy duck. There was also a message posted on the window that said \"best roast duck in the world\", so we came with rather high expectations. Arrived around 7pm on a Sunday and the restaurant was very busy. There was not enough space to wait inside so we had to wait outside the door.After a 15 minute wait, we were seated downstairs, which was a bit cramped and dingy. We ordered the half Roasted Duck and Oyster Pancake. The Roast Duck was good - the meat was tender and juicy, but the oyster pancake was pretty tasteless. Prices were standard Chinatown.Service was brisk and adrupt - normal for Chinese Restaurants so I had no complaints. However, we did ask for oyster sauce for our oyster pancake, but the waitress gave us Chili Oil. Maybe oyster sauce is more of a US thing and they don't have it in London?",

    "text": "PROS - When I was little, I was allergic to duck. I would break out in hives all over my face, arms and legs. My mom told me I would just keep eating and didn't care. Thank goodness I'm no longer allergic but even if I was, the crispy roast duck pancakes served here would encourage me to keep eating regardless. The three of us ordered the duck pancakes with a half duck and salt&pepper tofu (beancurd). The duck pancakes were delectable! The half duck was served in shreds to make it easier on us to make our own pancakes with cucumber strips and onion strips. We were given the duck sauce (looks like BBQ sauce) along with a trio of spices to fully customize our heavenly duck experience. The salt&pepper tofu was alright, but it was nothing special so I wouldn't order it again. CONS - It's a bit spendy for the amount of duck you get but Four Seasons know they are hot shit compared to other roast duck places around Chinatown so they are \"entitled\" to price their duck that way ;) So the problem lies solely with me and that I should get a higher paying job to eat more duck pancakes, dammit!",

The interior and decoration is disgusting, everything is old and covered in dust. The table I sat at was slanting so much that I felt sea-sick, it was slanting so much that it felt like I was in some kind of fun house at Disney land. But the worst part was that they did all the dishes behind me, yes right over my shoulder. The sound of plastic dishes clashing together was not pleasant at all. And when I thought it couldn't get worse, I saw the waitress drop and pick up clean dish from the dirty floor and put it back on the \"clean\" pile again.And then again when I thought it couldn't get any worse, I got the most grumpy and angry looking waiter in the world, the only thing he said throughout my experience was \"what do you want\" and \"thank you\" (when we paid). Everything was rushed, the food came out fast but so did the check.The food was very bland/bad, everything was off, the char siu I ordered tasted like hot dog! But hey! the famous duck tasted OKAY!I do not recommend this place at all!",

We ordered a whole roast duck (\u00a324), sliced beef (which was savory and slightly sweet, but so juicy and delicious), choi sum vegetables stir fried with garlic, tofu with prawn stuffing, and a herbal pork soup with black and white pepper which was a milky white color because of the carnation milk they added (we took a chance with the soup because it was so cold and we were so glad we did, it was so yummy and helped clear out my sinuses). \u00a0The total bill was around \u00a3100 but the food was amazing, \u00a0definitely one of the best I've ever had from both the U.K., and the USA. \u00a0The restaurant was fairly old and small even though it has two floors. We sat in the first floor and there were 6 tables. The staff was incredibly attentive. When we arrived, they took a few minutes to set up a table for us (3 adults and a toddler) and the toddler seat was set up before we even asked for one. \u00a0Once, we had dropped a chopstick, and the owner (manager?) immediately \u00a0grabbed us a new pair of chopsticks. When all our dishes arrived, our table was quite crowded and they quickly lifted up the extension of the table and gave us more space. \u00a0The staff spoke both Cantonese and Mandarin and I felt completely at ease conversing with them in Cantonese as they were extremely friendly and customer oriented. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for amazing Cantonese food. They also own \"Little Four Seasons\" which was more on the main side of Gerard Street but I have not yet tried it.",

We wanted to see what the hype was. We noticed they have multiple locations with the first being open since 1990, so we knew the food had to be good. I also double checked on Yelp and noticed most of the bad reviews were non-Asian or complaints about the restaurant, service, or tip. Aka, good food? Im down! The entrance and ground floor is tight but we managed to be lead upstairs to our table. I am glad they gave us a bigger table for our winter jackets, shopping bags, and room for the food we ordered. We asked what were some of the best sellers and ordered two dishes to share. Plus an appetizer of xiao long bao. The xiao long bao was meh, skip it. We also ordered the crispy aromatic duck and lobster. The duck was extremely good. The lobster as quite good as well, but not a good as impressive as the duck. The duck I highly recommend getting when visiting here. Next time I will get the traditional roast duck as it has been deemed by the Financial Times as \"the best roast duck in the world\" lol. That probably means at least in the UK it is the best. The waiter does speak Chinese and English so no worries if you cant speak Chinese. This place is pretty traditional from the food to experience. Dirty, small, dingy restaurant. Waiter is pushy and cranky (what Chinese adult/parent isnt lol). Plating is traditional (plopped on a plate lol). Table side service for the duck. The only thing I didnt do is get a hot bowl of water to clean my utensils lol. You do have to pay for rice and water. Oh, and I think I spotted 20% automatic tip. *For my fellow Chinese : Every Chinese person is showing face so wear nice clothes- service is better then - hint hint. This place offers great authentic Chinese food. Get off the high horse and get passed the ambiance/cleanliness, plating, service, cost, etc. and enjoy the good food they have to offer. Its good. It why you go to a restaurant at the end of the day....to eat. Visit and enjoy the Duck!",

Our dishes were extremely greasy and salty. I understand that a little use of oil prevents stickiness in the pan but when the vegetable dish is greasier than the meat dish then there's a problem. The couple things that were passable was the steam rice and BBQ pork. The chow fun was drenched with a very salty gravy. I think my doctor would recommend me to stop dining here. Also the men's toilet is the smallest one I've been to. How small is it? Imagine sharing an airplane bathroom with another person. I swear while I was peeing I was rubbing shoulders with the man in the next stall and rubbing cheeks with another man washing his hands. Intimacy is good sometimes but not in the toilet. After the meal there is complimentary orange slices and mint for your stinky breath. They also add a 12% service charge to your bill.",

We are sat and given water but had to ask for tea at $1.50/pp. When it came time to place our order I asked again in Chinese for 1/4 duck, chicken satay appetizer and the braised beef wonton noodles.The chicken came out first and then the noodles without the beef. I looked confused and said I ordered the beef one. One of the waitresses offered to switch it but I said it was fine. What bothered me was that waiter was adamant that I was wrong. He protested in Chinese \"I'm not wrong! She didn't order that!!!\" Soooooo when I speak in Chinese you pretend you don't know any but when something is wrong you complain in Chinese?? What great customer service...The wonton noodles were soggy and an off putting grey color. It's as if the noodles were pre cooked and just left out - the noodles were still sticking together in clumps in the hot broth. The duck was extremely dry and I was insulted that they would serve it. We were basically given shredded scraps (see pic). Had I not slathered the pancake with hoisin sauce, it would've been inedible. The chicken satay was decent from the one bite I tried but still fairly dry.This establishment provides better service to non-Chinese clientele from what I saw when I was there. Also, I think they sensed I was annoyed and they automatically charged \u00a020% tip to our check under \"Discretionary\" even though we were just a party of 2. What crappy business practices!!!!!",

We opted for the three meat plate each time and it was plenty of food to share. Their duck was juicy and not too fatty. I don't think it was a life changing dish but it was solid. What we really enjoyed, surprisingly, was their soy chicken. It was moist and had just a hint of flavor from the soy sauce. Their crispy pork was also solid and a nice textural difference to have. As for their other options, we were not impressed. We also tried their Peking style duck which was too dry and was definitely not worth the price. It honestly tasted like it was sitting out for too long. Their calamari wasn't special and was overcooked. I don't even really remember the other dishes we tried because they weren't that good.",

Then 3 starters, meat spring rolls, salt and pepper ribs and dumplings.The rice was a decent portion but the sauce that was wrongly sweet. The duck was OK, the pork was delicious and the chicken came with no skin, no bone and the spring onion came ontop of the duck! Why?? Plus the overall meat portion was small. The starters were appalling and clearly aimed at an unassuming audience who wouldn't know better. The ribs were bone dry and bland, the dumpling skin was thick and fried, but not in the way you'd want. The spring rolls were supposed to be 2 large pork ones but ended up being 4 small ones with non-existant chicken. Overall, I'd cone back for their expensive rice dishes if I had no other choice, but the starters were awful. Our waiter was ok but I heard one say \"everyone's tastes are different\" when being asked about portion sizes and what they would recommend.",

Four Seasons is famous for its roast duck. For my quick tutorial on the different types of duck in a CHinese restaurant, please refer to my review of the original Four Seasons in Queensway. I think the duck here is good but the accompanying soya sauce is a little sweet for my taste. They also offer it on or off the bone - it costs more to have it de-boned.I find it fascinating to stand and watch the chef using his big cleaver with the precision of a surgeon to de-bone the duck.So why one star less than the Queensway restaurant? The service here seems to have taken on the Chinatown shouting rudeness. At Queesnway, they never shout, even when it's stupidly busy.",

In chinese, they all sounded very appetising and more interesting than western style chinese food. In the end however what we got did not live up to what I was expecting; certainly nowhere close to what I've had in Vancouver, Hong Kong, San Francisco, even Royal China here in London. The portion sizes were extremely small, mediocre in skill, and poor value.I say stick to the rice plate and roast meat and you'll do fine.",

I LOVE their roast duck and really, if you can ignore the rubbish service (it's a Chinese restaurant afterall), you'll love the place. Things to note about Four Seasons: It's a dodgy little Chinese joint, not a five star hotel. There's one at Queensway and one at Chinatown. You'll find me at the Chinatown branch. They serve half duck or whole duck With or without bone at the same price. People get take out from there all the time, sometimes to take overseas (no joke the duck is that good) So it's rumoured (I haven't seen this) that they have a special container to pack duck for overseas travel! Wow that's hardcore! There's always a queue at Four Seasons And you can totally make a booking but you still have to queue (beats me). They work on turning the tables over so when you receive your main, expect to also receive your oranges and bill But with your bill they also give you kool mints, which I love. Customer service? There is none, but who cares.",

You can get a selection of three barbeue items for under a tenner, and it's a good way to try a little bit of everything. Service could be better, but the food is definitely worth coming for.",

    "text": "I was not impressed withthis restaurant, my boyfriend and I was awfully hungry and stumbled across thisrestaurant which had a queue outside of it. Naturally we assumed this was agood restaurant as many customers were waiting to go inside. The downstairs part wasvery busy and a man came to take our names and told us it would be 15 minutesbefore being seated. When it was our turn, we were told to go upstairs- as Iwent up the stairs, I passed a door which looked like a staff room for thewaiters (little did I know) this is where we would be seated. A waiter opened the doorand took us to our table, the upstairs was crammed! And too close for comfortas you could not have a conversation without everyone else hearing you! \u00a0The upstairswas just jam packed with tables and chairs with hardly any space to move. Definitelynot a romantic place to go for dinner. The prices for the foodwas double for something as simple as rice and stir fried vegetables, but thatis because it's situated in the middle of Central London. There was one thing that Ithought was highly cheeky! Was with our spring rolls they gave us a small bowlof what looked like Soysauce- I dipped my roll into this and said to myboyfriend This does not taste like Soysauce, it tastes like Leaperrins, Worcestershiresauce, to which my boyfriend replied Ofcourse it is, becausethey left the bottle next to the till behind you! I was shocked!- I'm notasian but even I know that was a pure mockery especially to those who know Orientalfood very well. I would not go back there again! Unless you enjoy being crammedinto a sardine tin room!",

    "text": "Four Seasons call themselves 'roast duck specialists' and not for nothing! This is their new branch (the one other branch is in Queensway) and is already very popular. Their dishes can be quite pricey compared to the average in China Town (around \u00a38 each) but there are less expensive rice dishes e.g. rice + a good helping of delicious roast duck is = \u00a34.90. So with tea and service charge you can get a very decent meal for about \u00a36. Expect to pay more if you want to try out the more flamboyant dishes though.",

The BBQ pork is supposed to have crispy skin, which was not the case. The duck was all fat. The portion was also very small. We will not come back.",

    "text": "The service at Four Seasons is atrocious. There is always a long queue so waiters try their best to make diners eat up, pay up, and get out to make way for other customers.Not too long ago, I had dinner at Four Seasons with a friend. He was not very good at using chopsticks but insisted on using them. Halfway through our meal, a waiter rudely snatched the chopsticks from his hand and gave him a fork and a spoon. A little later, before we could finish eating, they cleared our table without asking if we were done and served our dessert of oranges. We were too shocked to say anything. We then took our time with the oranges but were interrupted by the arrival of our bill which we had not asked for.We ignored the bill and carried on talking as we were not ready to leave. Not long after, the waiter returned and literally asked us to leave.I did the roast duck that everyone raves about and do not intend to. If you are vegetarian like me, you might want to think twice about going to Four Seasons. Their food tasted average to me and I am sure you can find similar food in other Chinatown establishments.",

The duck was especially good. It is pricey when compared to what we are used to in NY or HK, but the food was good enough to justify the higher price.",

It was bland and basic nothing exciting or even that tasty. The service was probably the most appalling I have seen. After we finished our main course we were asked to leave so that they could seat other people! So not the place to catch up with friends, because you won't be sitting, drinking tea, or having a chat after dinner. I made sure there was no tip left after the service we received.",
