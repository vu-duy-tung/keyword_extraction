Crate has great outdoor seating right on the canal so it's fantastic for a warm afternoon or evening. they also have great ginger beer options--much better than the typical off-license selections.only downside can be the crowds/ scene on a weekend night. though whether that's a good or bad thing probably depends on what you're into.",

    "text": "I went here for a pizza, so Crate is being reviewed as a pizza restaurant first. Had this been a review of the bar aspect it would score more highly.So anyway, I had high hopes for this place, having been told by the friend who brought me here that this was the best pizza in London.The problem is it wasn't. In fact it wasn't even close. When I was young my parents used to take us to a restaurant in Wembley called Chetna's that used to be a Pizzaland (and is now a Nando's). They used to offer pizza on the menu because they happened to have a pizza oven, and it was done to appease children who weren't happy about the vegetarian Indian food they specialised in. I had many a pizza here, being a kid, but they were nothing like as good as the likes of the Deep Pan Pizza Co. or Pizza Express, or even Pizza Hut!What does this have to do with Crate, you may ask? Well, Crate's pizzas are a bit like the ones I used to have at Chetna's. this would be excusable if their speciality was some other cuisine, but it's the only thing they serve!All 4 of our pizzas were overlooked. The spicy salami one was mediocre at best and seemed to have no tomato sauce on it. The chicken laksa one tasted a bit like eating a curry with a giant cheese naan, and the lamb one was well, just weird. All were dry.The only reason I've given them 2 stars instead of 1 is that as a bar it has a great atmosphere, and it's not as bad if you go there with the expectation of it being a bar that happens to serve pizza...",

You can sit in a boat on the canal or outside on a bench table and people watch and soak in the surroundings all day. They have an outside cocktail bar around the side if you need a break from the beer which looks pretty good (I never get sick of beer). Definitely at its best when it's a sunny day. Full of 20-35 year olds, a bit grungy and a little bit dirty but it suits the canal area. Highly recommended.",

Inside is industrial space with wooden tables and benches. Looks stylish, but without unnecessary pretension. I've tried four different beers here, and the golden ale is by far my favorite. It has to be the best golden ale I've tried. Amazingly subtle honey notes. Very drinkable and tasty. The stout is quite amazing as well.

Crate offers a decent but limited range of house beers; on my last visit they had, in bottle or on cask or keg, a lager, a bitter, a golden ale, an IPA and a stout; however, they do sporadically release a one-off. The house beers aren't bad, but neither are they terribly exciting. The venue itself is quite attractive. The interior I would describe as industrial chic. Outside there are a few picnic tables, at which you can sit and watch the canal. On my Saturday afternoon visit there were quite a few families here, almost all of them enjoying pizzas - Crate offers a dynamic range of pizzas, which are very good. The staff is friendly and one of the guys spoke to me at length about their house beer. Aside from the Crate beers, the bar offers a solid range of guest breweries, both on tap and in bottle. This place can get insanely busy, so I would advise not visiting during peak hours.Crate is located less than five minutes away (walking) from the Hackney Wick Overground station.",

You'll find it rammed to overflowing summer evenings and weekends and just rammed and noisy the rest of the year. Full bar, excellent house beers, acceptable coffee and crunchy super thin pizza. The pizzas on the menu are all very 'hip' except for the token margherita. It's nice to see something different but a shame when it's the entire menu. I went for the Mediterranean lamb, which tasted more like something from Edgeware road than a pizza. Except Edgeware road would have served it with a slice of lemon which would have been good with the lamb. It was tasty but didn't really feel like pizza. MY friend had the margherita that tasted good and traditional. They all come in one size, which is generous, and I was unable to finish. They offer take away but I didn't go for a doggy bag as they extra thin crust wouldn't be good the next day I don't think. There's a large sofa in the corner and the rest of the tables are large seating at least 10. Not ideal for an intimate date but perfect for a sociable evening out. Dogs are welcome.",

This place is a real community hub. As for the food the pizzas are worth the often long wait; paper thin, crisp and with unusual but oh so tasty \u00a0toppings. The sweet potato, stilton and walnut is a firm favourite of mine . Whilst you wait for your pizza to arrive there are plenty of their own craft beers to choose from as well as guest taps, bottle drinks, and wine, which the staff will happily advise on.",

Outside is rustic/industrial and inside keeps ou the industrial theme with some nice touches. \u00a0Like the bedspring lightshades - who'd have thought a bedspring could look beautiful!So, as mentioned, Crate brew their own beer, which includes Lager, Ale and Cider. \u00a0In addtion to spirits, bottled drinks and wines.They offer a great selection of pizzas which, in my humble opinion, are one of the best I've had in London so far. \u00a0My friend got the Sage and Truffle for which I got food envy! \u00a0And I got the Courgette, Feta, Red Onion and Gremolata. \u00a0Great falvour combinations and perfect portion size - the crust is very thin so you don't get quite as much of a carb bloat afterwards.The only peev I have is that the bar gets quite busy and you can be queuing for a while to get served, just saying...",

The paddle over was fun, and we were in need of something to warm us up, Crate managed to sort us out.The space is reasonably large and decked out with an obvious regard for the target clientele's sensibilities. Sadly the sun was down but I can imagine the outside canal-side area is perfect throughout the summer.Our pizza arrived in a reasonable time (35 minutes advertised above the bar seemed about right) and was very nice - thin base with sufficient topping (and flavoursome toppings to boot). This worked well with the pint of Crate IPA (hoppy, but well balanced). The staff were friendly and helpful, dealing well with the obvious burden of working in such a busy and popular place.If you're not slightly damp and quite tired from a paddle up the canal I'd reckon you could have a long and fun evening (as long as you don't suddenly need the loo - the queue is rather long). There are lots of beers to try, nit just Crate but guest taps. Just make sure not to miss the last Overground home at 11something.",

It's a real shame there isn't a little more originality in the decor and use of such a big space. As a cider fan, the one on tap was my choice. It was very nice and I would drink it again. Many times. The pizza was not for me. The topping/crust ratio is not something I've come across before, or would look for again. I do like a thin crust but that was thinner than your average bear. There was also no spice to my spicy salami :(Although on the canal, which would be great for summer, I'd opt for number 90, just down the road, for a drink instead.",

My husband and I wanted to see the old Olympic stadium and found ourselves crossing over a bridge by Crate and decided to stop in. The brewery has a great atmosphere and a lot of brew selections to choose from. We ordered a pizza, grabbed a couple of beers and sat outside on the picnic tables by the river. The atmosphere was the best part of the place, but the pizza was actually really good. Most places that mark themselves as a brewery fall short on the food expectations but Crate did not.

I'm swinging between loving it and saying it's mediocre... I adore the crate brewery, the pizza is absolutely amazing. I love the courgette, feta and red onion and the sweet potato, Stilton and walnut... It's some of the best pizza I've had! Last time we visited we ordered an extra pizza to take home as we weren't that hungry, needless to say we finished it all before leaving! Yes it's that good!The beer selection is also great, and the staff very knowledgeable and on hand to help.I also love the raw style of the venue, the mattress spring light shades, the brick work, concrete and industrial, functional, feel of the venue... Also it's right next to the river, so if you can get a table you've got a stunning view of the canal... and with big tables it's great for socialising, large parties and groups.However there are some pit falls...It's SO busy! Most nights (and in particular the weekends), you can't get a table, you have to wait for ages up to five deep at the bar and wait times for pizza can be anything up to 40 minutes!Also the toilets are a complete disgrace, so messy and unhygienic and the queues for these (even on the quieter nights), is still outrageous. They've installed some across the parking lot, but these are in a similar state.So overall I love what these guys have to offer and I full endorse their wonderful craft beer and food... but I feel they've a victim of their own success as the crowds ruin the experience for me.",

The beer choice is very good and the friendly knowledgeable bar staff offer the opportunity to try different beers before ordering. I chose the Pepperoni pizza as it's normally a safe bet anywhere however about half am hour later when it arrived I wish I hadn't.

Crate might as well be the filming location for that scene in the movie, since that's exactly what it is.Their tap list isn't vast but it has some strong entries on draught and cask plus a few guest brews to mix things up. The very thin crust pizzas are fresh and delicious: we got a prosciutto and rocket and a spicy salami and both hit the spot. Grab a seat at one of the tables and listen to the DJ spinning tunes ranging from hip hop to techno to disco, or get there early and sit outside by the canal before it fills up.This place is definitely off the beaten path, perfect for a beer geek like me who also appreciates getting far away from the touristy parts of town and into a London that probably only the locals know about. If you love beer and pizza, this is your spot. If you don't, we can't be friends. Ever.",

    "text": "It's impossible to overlook one the trendiest spots in Hackney Wick, namely Crate Brewery. Crate is guaranteed to be heaving with revellers, but the staff's ability to cope with the throngs has significantly improved over the past years. They brew onsite and have released a commendable and growing range, including their sessionable sour and black IPA. The brewery is idyllically located canal-side on the River Lee and offers rustic wood-oven pizzas to hungry wayfarers and ferrymen, who dock their canal boats feet from the bar.Crate now offers tours of their brewery and if you're lucky, you'll be there on a weekend when Mick's Garage is open and swinging, which is located just across the yard from the brewery. From 18:00 on Friday and noon on Saturday and Sunday, this is a pop-up space offering some fantastic Middle Eastern street food from Shuk Shuk, a meaty purveyor and smokehouse from the talented minds of Josh Katz and Mattia Bianchi, who founded the highly regarded BBQ joint, Berber & Q.In addition to this, Mick's Garage offers a fermented tea bar called Jarr Bar, where kombucha- set to be a huge trend in the coming months- is served in a gamut of flavours (or with alcohol). All of this is set to the soundtrack of a DJ spinning decks on the roof- the vibe is summer, the 500 person capacity means it fills up quickly and things get raucous. This is a surefire destination for a hazy summer evening in 2016.",

Despite lack of chairs and the overly hipster clientele, you can't really say this place is less than 5*.Between 6 we shared 4 pizzas... sage & truffle (exquisite); sweet potato & walnut (taste explosions); salami (had a kick); minced lamb (deliciously spiced). Literally there wasn't a mouthful I would take back.Oh and the beers are great. The bar man let me taste a couple so I could decide exactly what I fancied.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch on a Sunday, and sat outside by the canals. The pizzas were very good, and Crate certainly has style - I ordered a coke, and it was one of those glass bottle cokes and they served it with a wine glass with ice, the bartender's beer-pouring skills full force so that the coke didn't foam too much. Plenty of parking right at the entrance, for bikes, cars, and scooters. I'd like to return when it's warmer out!",

    "text": "Crate is an incredible bar in a fantastic location, directly next to the canal with a decent amount of outside seating this place is great for a summers evening. The bar offers a great selection of locally brewed bears and ciders. I have to say though some can be strong and have led too a few Monday morning hangovers I wasn't expecting. Inside the decor can be described as typically hipster with industrial influences. All the staff are incredibly friendly and very well informed about what's on offer. The pizzas they do are some of the best in london, cooked fresh and with a continually changing menu there is always something new too try. It does get busy and on occasion when the bar is busy they will close the kitchen early so it's worth checking wait times for food. Overall a lovely pub in a great location with awesome pizza, a winning combination.",
