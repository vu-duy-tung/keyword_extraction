Sushi novelty-type places and cheaper than Wagamamma, but it's unlikely to be a meal to change your life. The interior's plain, almost spartan. Very bright and white, with light wooden tables.

Best of all, their set bento boxes contain sushi, sashimi, edamame and a choice of main. The Beef Teriyaki bento is fantastic. This place isn't fancy.

It takes the resemblance of one of those noodle bars that are all over the place nowadays, however the great thing about this place is it's Japanese. I've eaten here twice, once prior to having a drunken night with the girls and the other time I was returning from a drunken night with my partner. I'm not certain, but I think it closes relatively late. Both times I've eaten here I've had a selection of Sushi and Terryaki Chicken. Dishes are priced on average at about six pounds per dish. The food is really tasty, I am a particular lover of Japanese food and the fact that I can go here after a night out instead of into China Town or Mc Donalds is great, as much as I am a sucker for Chinese food and McD's, Japanese is healthier.",

Great, great food whether you're after a mouth-watering array of spicy tuna rolls, wonder rolls, unagi, or a big, comforting bowl of ramen noodles. All kicked off with some spinach salad with sesame dressing or edamame and accompanied with some hot sake or kirin beer.

    "text": "hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026 When we are talking very decent and cheap food options in Soho,Taro is very high up on my list. I have been going there for years when fancying some quick Japanese fix. Not exactly the place you would go for a romantic dinner,but great for shopping break or pre-theatre food. If I would work somewhere close to Taro,you would find me there all the time in my lunch breaks. Taro is not an expensive place to start with but incredible value for money are the lunch deals. One wouldn't think that you can get a drink,a miso soup AND a bento box for below 7 pounds anywhere in London,let alone in the middle of tourist-ridden Soho. On my last visit I tried the chicken teryaki box (6.90) and I thoroughly enjoyed both the miso soup and the chicken. Splashing out on the non lunch deal side of things,the Vegetable Gyoza (5?)) were crispy and delicious. I have a terrible weakness for Japanese noodle soups,nothing better to warm your belly and your soul,and even though the Taro version of Udon Noodle Soup (6.50) did not stand out,it was very decent indeed. I rather like the atmosphere at Taro actually,it's one of the few places in London with high ceilings,which makes the place feel spacious,and loads of light is streaming in through the large window. As a consequence it doesn't feel as crowded as some of the other cheap Japanese options in the surroundings.",

The teriyaki and bentos looked decent as well, if a tad on the small side. Though it wasnt packed, the staff were really in a hurry to turn people over as quickly as possible- several times they took the soy sauce from my table to refill it, though I had not touched it. Overall a good bet but Im sure there are better Japanese places in the neighbourhood.",

    "text": "Taro is really very much a Japanese canteen-type cafe serving a variety of Japanese dishes including sushi, sashimi, soba, noodles and other simple dishes. It is open from lunchtime all the way through until late in the evening and is pleasantly busy all day. However you shouldn't find it too hard to get a table and reservations are not necessary. There were several Japanese restaurants in this area so why did Ichoose Taro? Well the only reason was value, but this is not to criticize any other aspects of the Taro experience. The service is acceptable - nothing special but friendly and polite which is as much as one can hope for when it's such a busy place and they work with a minimum of staff, the surroundings are pleasant enough but not especially different or comfortable so the attraction it held for me wasthe good food at reasonable prices. Being sushi lovers my fellow diners and I went for a sushi selection - mine came in a wooden dish - fairly deep - which had a good layer of sushi rice on the bottom and then the fish and prawns beautifully arranged on the top. This came in the form of prawns, squid, salmon, tuna, salmon roe and octopus - all of it was fantastic and tasted very fresh. One of my fellow diners chose a more conventional selection, which came on the typical wooden board though it contained similar ingredients to mine and was individual sushi items. His too was excellent. Taro really do provide a visual treat and the bright colours of the fish and roe would tempt me every time. Our table was close to the counter so we were able to watch the sushi chefs at work, which was very entertaining - it's also good to know that your food is freshly made to order and the chef knows who he is cooking for. We had bottles of Asahi (Japanese) with our food, but a full range of drinks is available. Other fellow diners were eating the noodles, which came in huge portions and looked delicious. The interior of Taro is clean even if slightly basic, but I think it is in keeping for an establishment of this kind. Wooden chairs and tables and not much else - a few pictures on the walls and the obligatory Asahi cats used for advertising. If you get a window seat you can watch the world go by as you eat and, you never know in this part of the capital, you may even spot a celebrity or two.At around \u00a39.00 each for a good selection of sushi we thought this was very good value - much more so than chain restaurants such as Yo Sushi where individual sushi items cost between 32.50 and 4.50.",

Sometimes you just want chicken terriyaki and some rice and nothing else, so I was thrilled to be able to get just that for \u00a35. The massive soup bowls and sushi servings my friends ordered, however, did look really good; I'd be inclined to go back to try them.

I generally only go to Taro for dinner and the place does fill up pretty quickly, would suggest getting there early or after the rush. The turnover of tables is however, pretty quick given the speed at which food is served so any wait will not be long.Two ways of looking at the shop itself, either cosy or cramped. I'm not a big person so cosy would be my opinion. They have a new one open around Knightbridge, but never been to that branch.",

There are days when Taro is great, and then your leftover with the crappy times!I went with a friend who for some reason gets a special price (I'm not fond of the charge what I feel like policy), then went by myself and got charged slightly more (-5), never mind I'm over it. It looks like the chicken teriyaki don is the most ordered item on the menu without a doubt, and I can understand why, glutenous rice topped with juicy chicken, ya just can't go wrong, plus I love the little box it comes in (+5 very trendy) Then me being me, decided to venture out a little and go for the ramen....hugely disappointed! Overly salty, not enough chicken (come on Mr. Taro), way too much carrots and bean sprouts (love ma veggies but theres a limit)to make up for the lack of meat & noodles! Definitley something I won't be ordering again. Besides the slight downfall of their soups the crowd generally seems to be happy with their food, my guess is that most are repeat offenders (diners) and know what works for them!So to wrap up, go try it, it's an experience none the less.......I actually enjoyed it, just in case my review sounded a bit harsh.",

We are big sushi eaters, so we started with an agedofu/agedashe tofu, which was bland, before getting our maki rolls: tuna, salmon, and shrimp tempura. The quality of the sushi was excellent, we're just not used to paying .30p more for a slice of cucumber and avocado, but taste was good so, no problem. The pot of tea we ordered? They gave it to the table next to us and poured their cups... And didn't realize their mistake until I asked (\u00a33!).What really made me come to this review, was the end of the meal. Sipping on our tea, there was a group of 4 who were refusing their table near the door, and requested to be moved more inwards. The owner sat them in waiting chairs right next to our table saying, \"they will be leaving, so this table is yours.\" Then, every 15 seconds, asked if we were finished until we \"asked\" for the bill! Disappointing to be forced out to make room for grumpy customers. Wouldn't come back with so many other options nearby.",

Visited in late May (bank holiday weekend, in fact) as both Kulu Kulu and Ten Ten Tei (on the same street) were shut on the bank holiday monday. Shame. But we still ate good food. Just less sushi. Despite eating sushi for nearly 12 years now, I'm still not familiar enough with combos, names and recipes. Maybe because restaurants aren't too consistent amongst themselves. In any case, it results in slow and confused ordering when I can't pick my sushi off a blush conveyor belt.",

It's my father's favourite restaurant in London and when he comes to visit, it is no hardship to go as it's cheap and central. But the sushi is so ... fatty. If fish and rice can be fatty, then this is. There is way too much rice enveloping the maki and it's too sticky and stodgy. The fish is average and I hate that they put wasabi inside the rolls. The yaki soba is average, the salmon teriyaki is bad, sliced too thinly and resting on a giant bowl of stodgy rice. And the service, or should I say, what service? We waited an age to order whilst tables who came in after us were getting main courses already. We then waited ages for the food - usually sushi is out to the table in a flash. I had to ask for a green tea refill twice and both times, it was cold tea. Great, thanks for that. Taro, you won't be getting any more of my money.",

Three good reasons, methinks.The decor is diner- rather than restaurant-style and there is a nice relaxed atmosphere to boot. The sushi was simple but tasty and not over-priced, and the spicy yakisoba was very pleasant, though the seafood was barely visible as it was so small.One bonus is that they serve Asahi, a delightful Japanese beer, and the menu is varied enough for me to happily go back, though only if I'm in the area.

While the outside may not seem preposessing - the food is absolutely fantastic. This is definitely some of the best sushi i've had. The rice was great - but what was really outstanding was the quality of the fish that they used in the sushi dishes. The food arrived quickly and it was very fresh. The prawn tempura roll was still warm and the tempura batter was still crisp when it arrived at our table. Getting a table is harder during lunch than supper. Even at 7 on a friday evening this place had spec to fit in a walk in table of 3. Although its pretty packed the two lunch times i've been there. Highlights: chicken teri-don - 3 different people that i've been with have raved about it and having tasted it, i can only agreed with their opinions.Prawn tempura roll - crispy and tasty - its somethign a lot places cant get right - either the rolls are a little greasy and soggy or rather tasteless - so it was a pleasure to eat these.",

Like him, the restaurant is very casual. In fact it is not the place you probably want to bring your girl on a first date as the decor lacks to impress. However, the sushi is downright succulent and yummy! If you've tried Nobu's Sushi and were amazed, then Taro should not let you down in taste since they use the same supplier! Only difference between the two is price and presentation! Taro's prices are probably half of Nobu's. I have never ordered anything here other than the sushi. I wouldn't recommend this place for anything else.",

The interior is simple and they have an open kitchen whereone can sit at the bar and watch them work while you wait. Mr Taro, who ironically put his on face in the logo, adds his own spirit to this place and can often be found running around and is sometimes even available for a little chat.Also I am not a big meat eater and i certainly appreciate the numerous veggie options on the menu. The tofu steak, which I only initially tried because it came as part of a bento box, is bound to convince any meat eater and tofu hater.",

HOWEVER, this is definitely not an ideal spot for a romantic dinner ( I don't know what we were thinking) as you sit elbow to elbow with the next table and sometimes feel like you should contribute to their conversation and take bites off their food.We had the chicken gyozo and miso soup for starters, both of which were fine albeit unremarkable (although I've never met a remarkable miso soup), and I ordered the eel bento box while my boyfriend had a chicken noodle dish (I don't remember its name because I was too busy savaging my box of bento).For 14GBP, the bento box is quite filling, although it's more rice than anything else. I had several pieces of salmon sashimi, tuna sushi and a few rolls in one section, then nigiri (eel covered in teryaki) on top of sticky rice, and a small salad section of edamame and peppers). I'd definitely come back for the bento box and ditch the starters; it's great value for money and a perfect meal for when you're starved of sushi but need something more filling. Despite my spilling my soup and making a mess, the waiters were great, friendly and cordial while quite brisk at their service. It's a great alternative to other restaurants where you tend to feel like cattle being prodded to eat and get out asap.We also had cold sake and bypassed the dessert; frankly, the restaurant's central location means you have so many fantastic dessert options just around the corner in Soho, and you will definitely need a walk after a meal at Taro.",

I also had a pokari sweat from the supermarket on the other side of the road, which quenched my thirst rather well.Even stranger was walking outside to the oddly London-like bustle of Brewer Street. Sadly strange was the lightness of change in my pocket, but never mind, a good noodle, is a good noodle.",

    "text": "I came here on a Tuesday evening for pre-theatre dinner with 2 friends. We arrived around 6 PM, but the place was pretty empty, so we had our pick of tables. I ordered the chicken katsu bento, while my friends ordered the sushi chirashi and the chicken teriyaki bento. The bentos came out first, but for some reason the sushi chirashi was really slow to come out; we think they might have forgotten it because someone else got their chirashi first even though they ordered after us. My bento was really delicious and a generous portion for a pretty reasonable price, especially for London. I briefly considered asking for curry on the chicken katsu, but since extra curry is listed at \u00a33 on the menu, I decided against it. The chicken katsu did have a nice sauce on it though, so I still really enjoyed it. The sushi, sashimi, and veggies were good too. I didn't get any pickles, which I thought was weird, since it was listed on the menu, but it wasn't a big deal. My friend's chirashi was beautifully presented and my friend said it tasted great.The restaurant is clean and has a good amount of seating. The bathrooms are downstairs; I had some trouble getting down there because there was a group of people sitting on some chairs right at the top of the staircase--not at tables, just some random chairs for some reason. The bathroom itself was reasonably clean but had a lot of random steps, so be careful. We didn't have any issues splitting the bill and I was able to pay with my American bank card.A nice restaurant for some decently priced, tasty, and filling Japanese food. It's very conveniently located near the theatres and Piccadilly Circus.",

The table was too small to fit us all of us, and I'm pretty sure my chicken was undercooked (despite being terrorised by an old man that he's been cooking for 20 years and knows when chicken is done by just looking at it) the food wasn't bad but I was a bit put off. In the end they did not help us split the bill and treated us like we were trying to rob them. Great experience :)",

I usually go for some chicken and rice dish and some Takoyaki (you don't often find Takoyaki in London! Takoyaki is octopus balls by the way).This time I went back to try Taro's version of Tonkotsu Ramen. It really wasn't bad, maybe above average, but not the best for sure. The broth was nice and tasty, but there were only 2 pieces of pork meat and the boiled egg was really poor. If you enjoy inexpensive Japanese food in the heart of Soho then you have to come here. Usually a lot less busier than Eat Tokyo which is close by, also an inexpensive Japanese Restaurant.",

First of all there are soem dishes which are nto Japanese at all but an infusion of western and Japanese cuisine. The good thing is that this infusion is successful. If you are planning to visit the place try out anything else but the sushi not because is not good on the contrary but because they have decent Japanese dishes that are well prepared and not very expensive.Now what they really luck though is service. Our waiter was real and i mean reaaaaaaaaaaaally bored of us, his job and/or his life and made no effort to hide it. He was slow and did not care of the service, i had to constantly ask him twice for anything i wanted and to top that he also was grumpy. I know that it difficult working on a Sunday but come on saw some spirit at least for the shake of you customer. i really regretted paying that service charge.I really like the place and i am willing to give them a better score but that only if they short out their service. Which i hope they will do soon",

The service, although brusque, was decent and we were seated immediately. It reminded me a little of my favourite Japanese place in Leeds, Fuji Hiro, with the simple diner style tables and a few condiments, but sadly that's where the familiarity ends. The menu is simple, so I went with what I know, and ordered chicken yaki udon. It comes with curry sauce, which isn't the usual so far as I know elsewhere (I only know it from two places in Leeds - we have a dearth of Japanese food) but neither usually curry it up. In any case, it came swiftly, which was grand since I was famished. Sadly, it was not everything that I'd desired in an udon. The noodles were cooked plainly, with only the curry sauce to flavour them, and that was oddly the blandest curry I've ever sampled. I mean, it had a degree of spice, it was dark, but it just lacked any taste. The veg, carrots and such, didn't help to further excite the dish and the chicken wasn't that inspiring. It was all fine, insofar as it meant I was no longer hungry, but the more I tried to shovel it in the more I realised I was eating merely to sate said hunger.I'm not in London often, but when I come back, I doubt I'll make a second visit. Fine if you need a refuel, but I'd try elsewhere for something tasty.",

Granted, we've only tried two vegetarian dishes, but we were very pleased with them on several occasions.The Vegetable Curry with rice is quite delicious. It comes with broccoli, potatoes, and carrots with a side of steamed white rice. It's a generous amount of food and hardy enough to fill you up without being heavy and unhealthy.The cucumber roll and hand roll are also as you'd expect. No complaints there and the hand roll is a good portion. The cucumber roll only has 4 pieces and for some reason they make it with wasabi. It's an extra charge to make it without wasabi because apparently they have to then make you an individual roll, which can only be six pieces and therefore more expensive. But the wasabi is only on one side and is quite a small amount, that it isn't really a problem.The price and quality of the food make it worth coming back here. On Saturday nights it's pretty busy, but we've never had to wait for a table for two. There's also a back room that serves for overflow or is good for privacy if you want to be more secluded.Service is good and prompt. Waters are refilled quickly upon request.",

    "text": "Overall, I was very pleased with the food and service of Taro. I sat at the bar because I am a lonely foreign traveler and have no friends *tear* but also, I like to watch the cooks in the back do their thang. If you choose to sit at the bar or have no friends like me, you can see the whole assembly process of cranking out a bento box. Lots of premade sauce and veggies from plastic containers to smother boxes full of rice, tempura and the like all at once. On the other hand, there was just one ramen chef (he looked like Mr. Taro but I don't know if it was actually him) so it was nice to see a more slow-paced, personalized attention to my ramen dish versus the whole Henry-Ford-process-bento-box-meal-thingy. I'm sure they are tasty but the assembly line itself reminded me of a fast food joint.What I ordered: Spicy Beef Ramen. (It was just beef ramen and I had to pay about a quid more to add spiciness). So, what you need to know about me is that I am an all-round ramen loverrr. Of the three weeks I've been in London so far, I'd say more than 50% of the time I was out seeking ramen.You know how some restaurants claim a dish is spicy but it's not and there's no kick? This ramen actually came out spicy! There was a lot of beef too, so no skimping on the protein here. It was a bit salty but that's how I like my food and although it was pretty oily (probably from the beef being stir-fried first) it was very very flavorful. Bonus points for the ramen coming out super quick!The service: ...was superb! Even though I sat at the bar, the waitresses, for the most part, took note of when I needed help. There was a point where no one saw me raising my hand for refilling my tea, so one of the two sushi chefs was so kind to ask me what I needed and then waved down a waitress to refill my cup. He could have just ignored me and let the waitresses do their thing but whatta guy! The other sushi chef eventually started a conversation with me asking about my whereabouts and comparing America to London - so endearing! (For what it's worth, if I were ever a sushi chef behind a bar, I'd probably keep a straight face and ignore people eating in front of me - I'd think it'd be too indifferent to give a damn about people coming in and out to eat my food. SO, +1 for these sushi chefs not being like me)",
