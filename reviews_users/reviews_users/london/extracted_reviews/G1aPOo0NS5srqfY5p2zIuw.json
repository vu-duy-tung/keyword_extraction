    "text": "Visited The Chinese Bakery in China town a few days ago, I must addict the cakes and pastries look nice from the outside but after purchasing some and tasting them myself, the quality is very poor and average. The buns are very dry and lack the extra topping, also the coconut buns is plain and hardly any filling inside. Usually they are supposed to be full of content inside it, yet it looks like nothing in it. The swirl rolls look interesting and colourful, yet hardly any cream and dry and plain to the bone. You are better off buying chinese cakes and buns from a major Chinese supermarket as for it tastes much nicer and the quality is very good. Also, the customer service there is extremely poor, I was completely disappointed with the lack of customer service in there. The staff don't wear staff uniforms so you get confused on who's serving and who's a customer, because they dress like a normal consumer! Also, you can't pay by card so all payments are done by Cash only, which was annoying. I was really expecting high expectations from there, however after going there once I'm never going back there again. I rather go to the other chinese bakery down the other side of the street called the Golden Gate Bakery.",

    "text": "As a non-European visitor to London, one of the most frustrating things about visiting this amazing city is finding an decent and inexpensive place to eat while on a tight budget. Fortunately, London's Chinatown seems to be the neighbourhood my family and I turned to whenever we did not want to spend more than \u00a37 on a dish. I came to this Chinese bakery recently with my friend and we got a few snacks.We got some Daan Taat (egg tarts), Gai Mei Bau (Cocktail bun), and some Coconut tarts. Each piece was around 90 pence, which is fairly inexpensive for an expensive city like London. The Daan Taat was pretty good, tasted almost exactly the same as some of the best Daan Taat in Boston's Chinatown. The Gai Mei Bau was also pretty good and a couple pieces could make a filling breakfast. Inside was fairly sweet and the bun itself was soft and chewy. It tasted almost exactly the same as some of the best Gai Mei Bau in New York's Chinatown. As for the Coconut tarts, they were also pretty tasty, and I enjoyed the sweet coconut flavour. I also came back for a second visit to get a Cha Siu Bau (Roasted Pork Bun). It was probably the most expensive version I had to pay for it (about \u00a31.70), but this is London. However, it was fairly big compared to the versions I had back in Boston and about the same size as the ones I had in Toronto and New York City. The bun was pretty tasty, soft and chewy on the outside, and meaty and flavourful on the inside of the bun. Overall, this is a pretty good place to get some inexpensive Chinese bakery staples in London's Chinatown, and I would probably come back again if I do not want to spend more than \u00a34 on breakfast or lunch.",

Entering the dim, slightly dirty establishment, we had our first doubts regarding the quality of the \"food\". Motivated by previous comments on Yelp, we soldiered on and found ourselves quarantined in \u00a0the back corner away from all other recognizable signs of life. Although we were excited about the buffet aspect, we were unhappily met with signs informing us, a la our grandmother, stating that if we didn't finish the food on our plate, we would be punished and charged a \"food wasting\" fee.This proved a genuine challenge when we found the food to be utterly unpalatable. I do not mean to be witty -- this stuff was nasty. As I recall, amongst all of the soggy fried badness, there was only one green, yet seemingly brown vegetable to be seen. And what unhappy \"broccoli\" it was. Ultimately, not only were my expectations of this well reviewed restaurant thoroughly belied, but I'm convinced that the other reviews were written by family members of the owners. Do yourself the personal favor of frequenting one of the many other restaurants in the area and save yourself the heart burn / ache. You can thank me later.",

    "text": "I never know what to order when I go to one of these Chinese bakery type places. Most of them just don't seem right, as neutral and unbiased as that sounds. And whenever I go eating with my Chinese friends, it's almost always for dimsum or real food. But then last weekend I met just the right person; a fine Englishman, who wanted to run home in anguish after the London Pride parties in Soho made him borderline claustrophobic. \"Would you like to pick up a Cha Siu Bau?\" he asked. \"Would I what...?\" I replied, and in instant recognition of my Chinese bakery evangelist, I jumped at the idea and him lead us (there were seven of us) to Kowloon on Gerrard St, which was teeming with even more human flesh than Soho.We wriggled our way into Kowloon as we received half baked greetings from the demi attendants who were not amused by the mass intrusion of what looked like decisively low revenue targets. An aggressive Chinese woman asked us what we wanted and before the answer was attempted in full, there was a paper box taped up with a threatening bill for a little lesser than \u00a310. The appearance being one of an overglazed bun, I still couldn't figure out what the big deal was. The first crunch revealed sweet bread, the sweetness coming from the glaze, which as an afterthought was just about right. Sweet tenderloin oozed out of the core of the dough which an elegance almost characteristic of the finest chocolate fondant I've had in Paris. The cornstarch from the sweet syrupy sauce played in my stomach for a minute reminding me of the steamed cousin of this baby I'd had, albeit inadvertently ordered, in Chinatown, Manhattan a few years ago. Loved, loved it!! I'm a fan!The chinese totally know how to stuff their bread.",

However, the queueing is generally good-natured if a little po-faced at timesThere are some savoury pies that will do for a light lunch like beef curry puff and some dishes that are usually dim sum dishes like savoury meat croquette. To be honest, the lovely flavours and textures are lost a bit in translation but try something new and you may be pleasantly surprised. For the sweet-toothed, there are cream cakes but I would recommend trying some Chinese delicacies like Chinese custard tarts and sesame seed balls.The girls serving you the food will give you a bag with your goodies and a bill, which you pay at the door.Worth a look for a treat and light lunch!",

If you want fried dough, red bean buns, or sausage buns, go to Kowloon restaurant.This place has so many pastries to choose from that I haven't gone through every one of them! It's reasonably priced and they have a good portion of drinks to compliment your pastry, including coffee-tea!",

My husband and I love this place, I have been coming here with my dad since I was a little girl and it really hasnt changed very much over the years.The bakery on the left side is still small but they always have a lot of fresh goodies coming out of the oven and a lot of yummy selections to choose from. The best things to get here are the Red Bean Moon Cakes (and my husband says anything else with red bean in it), BBQ Pork Buns and Coconut Custard Bread, sooo yummy especially when they have just come out of the kitchen.Prices are very reasonable and they always pack the goodies in a box for later, or you can just eat them and walk! We can't wait to go back to this place, Kowloon Bakery DONT CHANGE!!!",

    "text": "Well I promised my girlfriend I would cook her dinner tonight. However, what with alot of recent excitement in and around my flat, I didn't actually find the time to shop for delicious fresh food for my delicious fresh girlfriend (forgive the crass analogy, just turning phrase for your pleasure!) so after we did some shopping in Chinatown, I said I would take her to an all you can eat buffet. What followed was a dark chapter in my life as a restaurant connoisseur. Chinatown is an exciting place, especially for a first timer like me, but I was insistant on finding myself an all-you-can-eat as opposed to other restaurants where I couldn't eat myself to insensitivity for relatively cheap prices.. I eventually came across this place for \u00c2\u00a38.50 a meal and I was, as I usually am, easily satisfied. Pulling my girlfriend in, I asked for a table for two and was led to a table for eight and just placed there. Slightly perturbed, I took my seat but was told to in fact sit in a specific two-person bit of this eight-person table. Interesting... So I sat down. I was immediately asked what I would like to drink and I waited to see what my girlfriend wanted - simply because of the unwritten rule I employ when dining with a girl.. always let them order drinks first. I always get tap water (restaurant drink prices are just criminal) so that it doesn't make me look cheap when I order tap water after they order themselves something exciting.. however, at this restaurant, they told me that tap water wasn't an available service.. the menu listed everything from water to fizzy drinks at \u00c2\u00a31.50 and I thought Christ, that's expensive. I decided (unwisely, as it turned out) to order the same as my girlfriend, Green Tea. It also was \u00c2\u00a31.50 but had free refills so i thought, awesome! So before I went and got myself some food from the buffet, my tea was on my table but too hot to drink.. Green Tea Temperature : Piping Hot So I went and helped myself to some food. I was looking forward to this bit but I ended up feeling quite disappointed. They had alot of choice for the little commodities like prawn toast, seaweed, prawn crackers etc but as for the main food I am sure other places in the past have offered me at least double the amount that the Kowloon Restaurant does. With three types of staple (thinner noodles, normal noodles and rice) I chose my usual.. normal noodles with lots of meat. I was tucking in with my girlfriend when she, in her beautiful way that means she cannot be horrible about anyone or anything, said 'these noodles are a bit.. special' and laughed. She was right on the money.. an odd, almost soil like taste followed a mouthful of these noodles. I was a bit perturbed but the texture was still like normal and mixed with meat, it was bearable. The salt tally on my body was increasing sharply though so I turned to my drink for refreshment but.. Green Tea Temperature : Piping Hot This situation had become a bit too annoying for my liking and, gasping for appropriate refreshment, I was backed into the corner of getting myself some mineral water. Expensive, I thought, but the perfect accompaniment to this salt festival in my mouth. What I ordered and what they bought me though appeared to be very different things. I expected half a litre of nice cold mineral water. What I got was a warm bottle that had less liquid in it then a can of coke does. It managed to fill a single cup to the brim and that was it. Having drank this (it took me all of 6 seconds to do so) I turned to my girlfriend and asked her where the rest of my god damn water was! She didn't appear to know either.. so through a series of events, I was pretty fuming. In the end though, it did manage to get slightly worse. Green Tea Temperature : Piping Hot Having finished my meal, I reclined my chair with a full belly and was slightly less peeved then before. My girlfriend thanked the waitress in Chinese for her meal and luckily she didn't catch my glowering glance as I let her and the waitress know exactly what I thought of the meal. The waitress, in turn, was disappointed in me for taking some duck meat off the bone from the buffet cart and not managing to consume the bone itself.. for this I was so sorry, I must have left my shark dentures at home! I was charged \u00c2\u00a32.10 for leaving these bones on my plate and instead of arguing like I wanted too I just left so that I could tell my girlfriend, and anyone within about ten feet of us, what I thought of that restaurant. If you couldn't quite hear me, I was the one with the air turning blue all around me! I am not coming back to this place... I recommend that you don't either. Green Tea Temperature : God knows because I didn't get to drink it!",

We enjoyed it so much that we made the effort to visit a 2nd time after finishing a tour in Trafalgar Square.Egg tarts - Yes, good crust that doesn't collapse on the first bite. Center contents were perfect as it was smooth and rested on my tongue with no running liquid and reminds you of egg custards back in the days when people gave damn about quality.Sesame seed balls - there is a pretty decent churn on these and we had to wait 5-10 min for the next batch. For those who do not like the familiar large chunks of red bean, this is a good compromise as there is a sufficient amount but it doesn't overwhelm the entire ball.BBQ Pork bun - large portion, we got lucky that it was still pretty warm.",

    "text": "The first 1 star review I've ever given and I am extremely saddened... First of all, the food: there was a great selection. As someone who grew up with Asian baked goods, the selection got me and my sister very excited. And the food looked fresh enough! But when we saw the reviews, instead of going crazy and buying all the goodies we wanted, we decided to just try one. Thank goodness we did that! Because we purchased 1 Pineapple Bun and... it was terrible. Terrible in the way that it tasted stale, and it was salty? I couldn't figure out why because Pineapple Buns are supposed to taste sweet. I took one bite and immediately told my family members to just throw it away. It wasn't even worth trying to finish it. Second of all, the service: now, like I said, I grew up on Asian baked goods so I have pretty thick skin when it comes down to rudeness. But man, was the rudeness in this establishment on a hole other level. My mother asked the lady who picked up the food for people a simple question and the lady immediately just shouted an answer at my mum as if she was ignorant and stupid. When we went to pay, the lady just took the money. No thank you, no come again. Well, we won't be coming again anymore. This entire place was a disappointment. I don't really understand why they had so much business because just the service itself would've just put me off. Extremely disappointed, and it's establishments like these that give some Asian restaurants a bad rep.",

It did look busy inside when we entered but we were taken to a table and sat down after a couple of minutes the person on the till started to talk loudly at us saying we couldn't sit there I tried to explain this is where we were told to site and tired to see where she wanted us to move to but that clearly didn't work until the original person came back and moved us to another table. Plates were eventually brought over and we went a picked our food have to say that the choice was good and the food was hot so that was something positive the drinks didn't taste great but they were from a can. Value for money wasn't really there which was a shame",

    "text": "Buffet review only:'Twas a rainy evening in London on Christmas, and my family and I were tourists trying to find a decent and inexpensive place still open for dinner. Seeing the multitudes of people inside, we assumed Kowloon was an okay restaurant and entered. Fake news! Turns out the others inside were also misguided tourists who stumbled into this trap of a sad, sad restaurant.We were seated at a table in the back, where the corner of the walls was visibly cracked, repaired haphazardly, and then left to attract dust and grime. The waitstaff immediately demanded the money in cash upfront. It was \u00a314 per person. We were then given plates and reminded repeatedly to take our plates with us to the buffet. We asked for still water, and it took them fifteen minutes to bring us a pitcher and some old plastic cups. The staff kept yelling at each other throughout the restaurant, creating quite a noisy environment. They gave us an empty bowl to scrape our leftovers into, because we had to reuse the same nasty-a** plates. Revolting!I started on my treacherous trek to the food area, carefully squeezing my way through cramped tables. The buffet selection was minuscule - about sixteen different selections, just enough to line the windows and deceive hungry passerby. A third of the food was the type of fried food you can get at the store and bake in your own oven. The curry potatoes dish looked like half of one potato swimming in a yellow grease pool. The broccoli dripped with oil. The rice was steamed with dubious egg-like flakes. I wondered why they had a serving spoon with the so-called Singapore noodles; turns out they had cut it into such short pieces that it was possible to serve with a spoon (very inauthentic fyi). They had no soup or dessert.Bathroom: [redacted to prevent your complete loss of appetite]Bonus: a French couple was on a date next to our table. Both grabbed fried food and ordered cans of Coke (\u00a32 each I believe), neither finished either, the man asked for dessert and was rudely told that there was no dessert, both looked thoroughly disappointed at the end, their relationship was maybe on the rocks after this experience, who knows.Tl;dr save yourself fifty pounds and a nightmare. If anyone is in contact with Gordon Ramsay, tell him to come here to film Kitchen Nightmares. Sad!",

If I hadn't had that specific treat in mind I'd have been in big trouble, as boy is there some yummy looking stuff in here!Ignoring the fact that at almost 6ft I felt like more of a giant in there than usual, the tricky part is figuring out the non-obvious serving 'system' which kinda adds to the experience. Basically just push your way over to a server as soon as you see one free, as you won't be beckoned in. Point out what you want (literally) and they'll load you up a box of goodies whilst you go pay at the cash-only till. Pick up your box. Enjoy.Ok I confess it was actually my housemate that figured that out whilst I was looking around drooling. There's huge choice, both savoury and sweet, and all looks enticingly fresh (not like those places you go in and suspect some things have been sitting there for a week). Also a small seating area at the back though it looks like most people take away. At \u00a31 a pop the mark-up on the custard tarts versus HK is noticeable but hey inevitable, and we picked up half a dozen to satisfy the cravings! Firm pastry, light custard, not too sweet and with a good amount of wobble, so I'll definitely be hitting this place again to taste test some more. For now though I still have 3 left in the box to deal with before my housemate gets home... mmm.",

    "text": "One of the better Bakeries in Chinatown- brisk, efficient staff ( one lot who take and box your purchases, before handing an invoice to the person at the cash desk) . The standard I use for judging bakeries in Chinatown is pretty simple- the roast pork bun. here, I found it well executed and fresh, as were other purchases, including a lurid but delicious Swiss roll. Prices are pretty similar to the local competition \u00a31-\u00a32 per item.",

    "text": "Quick glance:+ two varieties of egg tart+ staff handles baked goodsFull review:After visiting half a dozen bakeries in Chinatown, I found it here at Kowloon - egg tart with short crust base. All the other bakeries offered only the puff pastry variety (some looking sadder than others) but I've always been a fan of the short crust base. Imagine my delight when I finally found it here at Kowloon, and they look perfectly formed! Not to mention oh so tasty. The other positive is that the staff handles all the baked goods so you know the food stays relatively hygienic.",
