Service is very good without being intrusive and food, which ranges from simple burgers and chips (the chips are grrreat!) to the best cooked fish I've ever tasted. The decor is old-fashioned in a good sort of way, mixed with a modern twist - tiles, stained glass, etc. There are also tables outside, with heaters, and so is great to have a coffee, or even a meal, while watching the world go by. Always busy for food or just a drink - a real coffee conoisseur I know says it's the best place in Chiswick for an expresso. Only 2 minutes walk from Turnham Green tube station and loads of other nice restaurants around if you don't like the look of the menu! That said, it's a great place which is also open for breakfast - an ace way to start the day!",

The fact that it's usually buzzing with customers tells its own story.On a lovely heatwave day like this, eating al fresco at this restaurant is a real treat. I was lucky enough to pinch one of the outdoor tables.The food is very good and takes influences from around the world - chicken club from the USA, hummus from the Mediterranean, duck confit from France and some good old English fare like chicken pie.I had some very nice freshly shucked oysters, served with a twist of lemon. The fish soup was exemplary and full of depth served with all the appropriate garnishes. It was too hot to have a full meal and so I finished with their take on a chocolate fondant served with ice cream.It's not a cheap meal but competitive for this part of London. I noticed that they're open all day, serving a breakfast menu as well.",

There's an extensive menu and the food is good if slightly on the pricey side for this part of town. On the other hand, it isn't very welcoming. The reception at the door is often a bit like a club bouncer. I live near by and I have often eaten here and I have seen it get slightly less busy over time but they still have the attitude that the place is going to be fully booked and you won't get in unless you're on the VIP guest list. It's just a vibe I get and I find that I can usually book a table via OpenTable without a problem.Also, a couple of times recently, I have had the distinct impression that I'm buying bottles of wine but not getting the full measure. Perhaps the waiters were using our bottle to pour wines by the glass for another table. I've seen this happen at other restaurants.On the whole you'd get equally good food and a friendlier atmosphere at the Roebuck down the road (for gastro-pubishness) or at La Trompette (for fine dining).",

The restaurant itself is beautiful and it was very pleasing to just sit and look around. My only complaint is that the price did not meet the portion. I thought the portions were great (as most places are tending to over feed us) but the price did not match.

They all offer well designed spaces with the focus on luxury with a touch of uniqueness. But venue is one thing, clientele is another. SH locations have always had a 'them & us' air about them- but they're just about bearable when the venue is populated by creatives & media types. With the Chiswick catchment area of bankers, lawyers & estate agents you get far too many middle-class wannabes who like to look out and gloat. Shame as the venue's contemporary design is a refreshing addition to the High Road. Food is always good (breakfast/brunch excellent), but on the expensive side. Just try & ignore the Hedge Fund Managers!",

Would I go back? \u00a0I would because I would like to try the other items on the menu which looked good. \u00a0I just hope I get a more engaging waiter next time.",

A menu with loads of options and amazing breakfasts.. Would recommend their pancakes with bacon and maple syrup and their full English..Always very accommodating for young kids as well which is why it's such a hotspot for the chiswick mums! They do a mean gin martini too! :)",

I thought a simple concept as \"sandwich\" was universally understood. Maybe I do not speak posh.The mozarella was freezing cold, the bread was kind-of-warm and the full thing was full of salt. The chips looked really cheap, but the price wasn't.The service was slow and they need to think about team work, \u00a0it can't be you have to ask for the same thing several times to different members of staff.My napkin had a massive stain (see pictures) that I can't believe they did not see when folding.Really, why oh why is everbody eating there when its not good?Just to pretend you are ultracool.

My only gripes are that they took away a lot of items from the drinks menu and some of the bar people don't always know how to make specific drinks. Otherwise it's the best place in Chiswick for all-round food. The prices are also very fair.",

A lovely warm evening in the outdoor seating area. Lovely people watching and loud chatting spot.There seemed to be a few different french bistro-ish kind of places in this area. Couldn't decide on a main so had a bunch of little things. The mussels provencal was tasty but prefer the version with cream and wine...that they don't have. Meh.And I swear I think I just make my french onion soup with too much wine for most because this is the third time I've had it in a restaurant and it's been too sweet for me. But they loaded up on the cheese topping so all was forgiven. With wine this place can get fairly expensive so choose wisely.",

The place always seems packed with people so I decided to try it out for dinner on a Thursday evening when my family was visiting. The staff were very accommodating and although there were no tables available managed to move some things around and get us seated quickly. Although they were able to get our table prepared quickly, everything else was incredibly slow. Drink orders, food orders, and even the arrival of the food took ages. I understand that it was a busy night but even waiting for the check was a lengthy process. The food was ok and a bit overpriced. I had the nicoise salad and shared the buratta appetizer to start. The salad was alright, nothing special and small for the \"entree\" size. The burratta was not exciting at all and was pretty dry which was quite disappointing. The place does have a nice atmosphere. I would maybe come back for drinks at the bar, but probably would not eat here again.",

I went in after reading the reviews here, on my cellphone.I had poached egg and hollandaise sauce atop smoked haddock, with toast, and two Americanos.The food was deicious, although I felt the portion was rather small, and it wouldn't exactly cost a fortune to be a bit more generous with the toast!The coffee was ok, and having milk in a proper jug might seen trivial, but it's a whole lot nicer than those annoying plastic pots! Sugar cubes were also on the table (although I don't take it myself).Service was pleasant and friendly, but not very attentive. I had to attract a waiters attention to get more coffee, and to get the bill, although I wasn't kept waiting.Minus point: I know the menu says that the 12.5% service charge is discretionary, but I HATE that. I am always happy to tip good service, and quite likely to give 15 or 20% but to have it added on really irks me. I would return, and try other dishes.",

    "text": "I have only been here 5 times but consider it one of the best places in Chiswick.The menu is varied enough so that you can go there (booking recommended!) and have what you feel like at that particular time.Firstly, it is ALWAYS busy and for me personally not the relaxing atmosphere I like to enjoy food in. The tables are also close together and the accoustics make it even harder to have a quiet, private conversation.There service is mostly good but obviously there is a lot for them to do so occasional mistakes of lack of attention are understandable and I can overlook.The food itself is mostly of a high standard. I recently had the BEST 'Sunday Roast' I have thus far sampled since moving to Chiswick 5 years ago. It was some really succulent Roast Beef with all the trimmings. The Beef was a generous portion with 1 large Yorkshire Pud and a small side dish of crispy on the outside but fluffy inside \u00a0Roast Potatoes and Carrots and some leafy stuff. The Gravy was very \"French\" in an alcohol way but was fine. At just under \u00a320 it was more than the local pubs charge but was worth it.The Eggs Benedict is probably just below 'Balans' for being Chiswick's top maker of that dish.The English Breakfast I had here once was solid and almost equal to 'Carvosso's at 210', both places are expensive but for the occasional treat (I rarely eat a cooked brekkie) I would rather spend more for the quality than have it at a \"Naff Cafe\" for half the price.A female I was with one time had the Potatoes Dauphinause which she raved about. I tried some of her Battered Plaice goujons which we both thought were not all that good for some reason. The Tartare sauce was not to my liking either.All in all, there is a reason why this place is so popular and I recommend going there at least once.",

Upon arrival they get given large glasses of chenin blanc by the snooty waiters and with plates of rocket and capers they spill out onto the pavement to infect the rest of W4.It certainly looks very cool inside, but the food and drinks are boring and overpriced and the staff are forcefully unpolite.
