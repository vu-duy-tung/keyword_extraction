The duck tongues were not properly cleaned. Service was terrible. Our hostess, Radka, was rude, unprofessional and impatient. Seems like there is a different vibe from her when it wasn't a group of white customers. She never came to check in with us as she did with all the other table with white customers. Overall I'm pretty disappointed with duck & waffle given how much hype there is around this place. My recommendation, don't bother. There's better duck elsewhere (up the street really)",

The burger was by far the most innovative and interesting of them all. Foie gras was tasty, but it got a bit monotonous after a few bites. The duck and waffle was not unique or particularly interesting - not sure why it is the dish that give name to the restaurant. The drinks were really tasty -- we had the mojito and the seasonal spritzer. Service was impeccable: attentive, fast and friendly.",

We totally lucked out as we thought we would leave London without trying this place. They have most of the famous dishes here but don't expect the same type of service. This place is a bit more of an express version but that's the whole point. It's catering for those people who either can't get reservations or don't want to trek out to the east side. Either way, believe the hype, the food here was great and really as good as people say it is.",

    "text": "For those who've always wanted to try the ever-so fancy duck & waffle but never got the chance to book a reservation or are too intimidated by the sheer extravagance of it all, try duck & waffle local! The menu is not too big but it has the famous duck & waffle dish, which is a must for any duck fan! The waffle is pretty standard in my opinion but the duck confit itself is the main attraction. The crispiness of the duck was what takes the cake for me. It was the right amount of flavor, and especially in addition to the fried duck egg and the waffle, everything was a good mix of texture and taste. My only thing is that the meat itself was a lot drier than I'd like, but it was merely a preference thing. Service was friendly and quick. In order to speed things up, as it can get very busy in there, you order first before a staff directs you to an open seat. We came right before lunch so there was no wait at all so I do recommend going offpeak hours just in case! Overall, I definitely enjoyed my experience here and would definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a quality and decently priced meal in central London!",

The waitress, however, changed her attitude towards us as soon as we opened our mouths and she figured out we are Americans. The menu is fairly small with few choices. I ordered two eggs any style and toast and I asked for the eggs over easy. When she acted puzzled, I changed the style to fried. She continued to act puzzled and asked me if I wanted them fried or poached. I repeated fried and she asked the same question again. I then told her that they could poach them. She then repeated to me poached and proceeded to make a face as though I was crazy. We were hardly attended to the entire meal and after 4 ignored attempts over the time of 15 minutes to flag her down to get our check, we were finally able to pay and leave. Needless to say, we did not add any additional service tip like we normally do and I'm quite sure that she believes Americans are stingy. The highlight of the meal was the duck and waffle that my husband ordered. Everything else was just par and not spectacular.",

The Duck was cooked well and is very tender. I also shared the duck gizzards with my best Aussie mate since she has never tried that before, and she loved it!",

We had the duck beni, duck and waffles and foie gras creme brulee (to share). I was obsessed with the creme brulee. It was a pretty rich breakfast, but was really happy. Freshly squeezed orange juice was nice and coffee was good. Service was probably more like a 4/5 but it was first thing on a Sunday and they weren't quite fully staffed yet. Manager was very attentive and made up for it. Decor was great and felt open and contemporary. Perfect way to start our day in London before doing some sightseeing.",

They still have open seating at the bar area, but only a very limited bar snack menu. You still get a chance to enjoy the view of London from 40 floors up, just no duck...only some sweet waffles.If all you really wanted to try, however, is the actual duck and waffle dish, Duck & Waffle Local is the way to go. No reservation needed, plenty of space, and comparatively cheaper for the same exact meal. In the now somewhat saturated space of chicken and waffles, duck and waffle was a nice small but luxurious twist on the dish. The duck was rich and flavorful, as expected, and the waffle was just as good as you'd expect it to be. Topped off with a fried egg and maple syrup, it wasn't too large of a meal but definitely left that sort of heavy brick feeling in your stomach.",

    "text": "I came her with a few friends after not being able to get into the original Duck & Waffle restaurant and were excited to try the food which is raved about online. If you are looking for the original fancier duck & waffle be sure to make reservations! I like duck and I like waffle. I've never had them together before but have had chicken and waffles and am a fan of that. After coming to Duck and Waffle, I am definitely a fan and wish there was one in LA!I was surprised to see that there was no wait when we arrived and the service was spectacular and very quick. We tried the foie gras creme brulee and that was a good appetizer, but the best part of the meal but I would order it again if I were to ever come back. I also tried the duck fat fries and the duck ears and would not bother ordering those again if I were to come back but they were neat to try.Now... onto the main courses. I ordered the duck burger with a double patty. I don't know what it was, but I felt like this was one of the best burgers I have ever had. If I could go back, I would get a single patty instead of the double as I feel it was be easier to eat and possibly better balanced. The combo of the perfectly cooked pattys, the duck juice, the crispyness of the dried ramen, it was just an awesome burger. I am getting hungry again just thinking of that burger!!I got a chance to try the duck and waffle as well and it was another delicious entree. With some chicken and waffle places, one of the complaints I've had is that sometimes the chicken gets dry at times and is not consistent. The duck here was flavorful and juicy and the waffle was cooked very well. It is a tough choice between the duck & waffle and the duck burger but you can't go wrong with either.",

We opted for this location instead. The wait staff were very welcoming and were friendly. Really wanted the creme brulee'd foie gras but they ran out of foie gras! Was utterly disappointed but I will be back for this. My mother and I split our dishes so we could try out the two popular dishes.Duck burger with ramen: duck, overall, had a nice savory flavor. I love how the skin was slightly crispy with the right amount of duck fat under. Delightful combo. Ramen kind of through the whole burger off. Was it really necessary to include it in the dish? Duck and waffles: I am a sucker for chicken and waffles but duck and waffles? Game changer. It's an upgrade by far. Duck is tender in both dishes. I love the maple syrup that they provide with your duck and waffles. Sweet but not overpowering. Pour it on the duck to get that pop of flavor of sweet and salty. Lovely combo.Duck neck: I can do without this dish. It was way too salty to peak my interest. Had one bite and I couldn't have another bite.",

The foie gras cr\u00e8me brulee was amazing. I never thought you can make a savory cr\u00e8me brulee, but it worked! It's rich and creamy with a hint of sweetness due to the sugar glaze. It was plenty for the amount of bread that came with it. The duck fat fries were alright, not as flavorful as I expected. The duck ears tasted like chips and it came in a brown bag that looks like a packed lunch. I was not really impressed by it.I got the duck & waffle as the main course and it is absolutely better than the chicken & waffles from Roscoe's in America. My duck was still very moist and the waffle was perfectly crispy. Then you pour the syrup on top and it is the perfect dish. My fiance got the duck burger with double patty. To be honest, you taste more of the 2 beef patties than the duck. But it is still one good gourmet burger.",

Good enough to inspire me to write my first review in years! My boyfriend and I split the duck jam doughnut, foie gras creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, the duck and waffle, and duck fat fries. All were delicious, but the two dishes one MUST get in my humble opinion would be the duck and waffle and foie gras creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Words can't describe the exquisite combinations of flavors these two dishes provided, so just trust me on this and order them!Service was also fast and friendly. The restaurant was clean and nicely decorated and it didn't do too much damage to my wallet. All in all, it was a great way to kick start my Europe vacation and I have no complaints. 5 stars!",

In the States, most places charge at least twice as much for duck. I also love chicken and waffles (it's usually what I have for my birthday lunch) so this restaurant seemed like the natural choice for my last night dinner. My partner was being a grump and said he didn't want to eat anything but would sit with me and have a drink. But once he got to the restaurant and saw the menu and the food on the other tables he caved and helped me eat all the delicious food.We ordered the duck & stormy, olives, duck and waffle, and the duck donut. Everything was delicious, but my favorites were the olives and duck and waffle. The staff was friendly and courteous.",

    "text": "I am a BIG fan of duck and Duck & Waffle really hit it out of the ball park for me. Back home in the U.S we are used to the Chinese Peking Duck and more traditional French duck dishes. When i saw this place on yelp my mind was completely blown. Duck & Waffle (5/5) Duck Confit over a perfectly cooked waffle and some sort of homemade maple syrup topped with a sunny side duck egg. Must get!! Duck was tender, almost fall off the bone and the runny egg was heaven since it helps offset some of the saltiness from the duck. Duck Fries (5/5) This was a first trying duck fries when I was here in June. Fried in duck fat, the fries had great texture and was perfect all on its own without any ketchup or sauces. Foie Gras Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e (5/5)This was the dish I was crazyyyy about. I mean come on!! Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e from Foie Gras?! So buttery and savory with a hint of the sugar, served with a buttry Roll topped with something i forget. This dish is genius and I wish they had this in San Francisco.... I still miss it til this day.Overall, MUST TRY in London. Service was spot on and servers are pretty tentative in filling your drinks and taking your plates away.",

They have wonderful (but pricey) cocktails on tap. Sadly I was a bit disappointed. I had the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e dish that had not much flavor at all. They tried to be savory and sweet but the texture and flavor weren't for me. The portion was small. The fruit in vinaigrette was amazing! Very unique. Our friend had the burger which looked (and was told) amazing. The pork and waffle was also a very small serving. Overall this place was meh. I think it's more the atmosphere that makes it what it is.",

    "text": "Traveled to London with 2 friends and I had this place bookmarked as a must eat because I love ducks. I've only heard of chicken of waffles, so duck and waffle was a must. We ordered 4 things: Vietnamese salad with crispy duck: The skin was crispy and duck was juicy and tender. The salad itself was phenomenal. It was very refreshing. I would definitely order it in the summer while sitting on the patio. It was definitely worth the extra $4 for the duck in my opinion.Duck and waffle: The waffle was very soft and chewy and the maple syrup wasn't super sweet. The duck's skin was crispy which was good, but the meat itself was dry. The duck was overcooked, so it was hard to chew. The egg on top made the overall dish look nice. \u00a0I stacked the duck, egg, and waffle together then dipped it into syrup so that I was able to taste the whole dish itself in one bite. Dry fried duck tongues: I've had duck tongues before, so I thought dry fried was an interesting way of making them. My friends and I thought the dish was way too salty. It wasn't dry at all and I think it's probably because of the sauce which made it wet and not so much fried even though it was really oily.Duck fat fries: It was so fatty and tasty. It came with ketchup and I think the white sauce was mayo. I love fries in general and I don't think it's possible to mess up fries. I'll definitely order fries again.",

The menu clearly specializes in duck, and it does not disappoint. By far, the Bao was my favorite dish. It was delightful. Followed close by the burger. We also enjoyed the broccoli, duck wings and fries (I think they have truffle on them so extra tasty and perfectly cooked). We ordered the gem salad and beets salad, which were also good (but clearly not as exciting as the other stuff). The service was wonderful and our waitress was very attentive and helpful. Overall, I'm thrilled we stopped in and I'd recommend to all.",

Their duck Eggs Benedict (crispy duck skin, two eggs, hollandaise sauce on waffles) was probably one of the best tasting things I've eaten in a long time. Even when I show up with a large group, the wait time isn't terrible and the staff is still on top of their game. I recommend the duck creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e as a side for the Eggs Benedict. Also killer. I would recommend passing on the duck donut. It sounded good but in comparison to everything else, sort of fell short.",

So on a nice day if you wanted to enjoy the outside, you can sit on the patio side. I enjoyed my duck burger, and duck + waffle. The portions are a little smaller and pricier than I would like but everything was pretty good. We also had a side of duck fries, I enjoyed it but in my opinion, it could be have more duck flavor.",

It was salty beyond belief and dry as well (each bite was just fried salty crisp and bone--couldn't taste any tongue flavor). Creme brulee was good in flavor, but too salty as well. The saving grace was broccolini, but that was drenched in salt and sauce as well. \u00a0Would not recommend--please take your money elsewhere. Overpriced and underdelivered.Update: At the end of the meal I complained to the manager about how ridiculously salty the duck tongue and creme brulee were and she talked back to me and accused me of lying. \u00a0She said \"why did you eat 80% of the food\"? I responded \"because I was trying to force myself to eat it.\" And she kept insisting I was trying to eat without paying because I \"ate 80% of the food.\" And I should have complained after the first bite.In my culture, you eat what's in front of you even if you don't like it, because someone worked hard to prepare it. That's why my friend and I tried eating the whole dish, but we couldn't down the extreme saltiness. \u00a0That's why we couldn't take it and finally I complained.Very unprofessional manager. She insisted I was lying to get free food. Extremely disappointed. Please don't bring your business to such a hostile restaurant.",

    "text": "Love to eat duck? Then this place is a must visit when in London! We initially wanted to eat at the original Duck & Waffle, but since they were booked, but we opt for this location and I'm glad we did! FOOD: Although, Duck & Waffle Local has a limited menu of the original Duck & Waffle, it has most of the popular items at this location. They also have non-duck items such as steak and veggies on their menu. We ordered: + Duck & Waffle: half a Belgium waffle, with duck thighs and sunnyside egg paired with maple syrup with poppy seeds! The waffle was nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside. The thigh wasn't too oily, nice and crispy and tender on the inside. The sunnyside egg was a great addition, since the runny egg yolk is good with pretty much anything. + Foie gras burlee: omg this was freakin amazing! If you are a foie gras fan, I highly highly recommend this! Imagine foie gras with crunchy sweetness added to it! The only suggestion I would add, is provide more bread, it's not enough for that much foie gras. We asked for more, and it was 1 pounds extra, which isn't too bad. + Steak: the seasoning was a little too salty and the greens it came with was too bitter for us , but other than that the steak was juicy and tender! SERVICE: It wasn't too busy when we arrived, so service was great! Very attentive and efficient. AMBAINCE: I really like the decor they have here! It has the vibe of a cozy barn. \u00a0Bathrooms are located downstairs to the right of the restaurant. Verdict: If I'm ever back in London, I would definitely come back and try their other items!",

My favorite is the roasted beetroot salad.... so refreshing! We also had the side of duck confit with our burger, something different but it paired really well with the burger. I'd definitely recommend this place if you're in the leicester square area",
