I thought the steamed broccoli, Bernaise sauce and salad were better then the actual steak. I ordered a lime and mint fizz that took as long as our dinner to be delivered to our table -- I had to ask about it 3 times. Felt that the staff focused on being \"cool\" rather than actually focusing on customers. Major room for improvement there. Lastly, I think walking in and being flung an iPad by a grumpy hostess, and then waiting 45 mins to be sat is disappointing when the meal wasn't good. Was really hoping for a better meal after reading all these 5 Star reviews that I'm now suspicious of. I had a 2 star experience at best.",

Plus service.They have on trend beers and cocktails ...They are looking in the right direction with sides and dessert.The green salad that comes with the steak isn't worth eating ...But this place is supposed to make tourists feel like they have been to a cool London place ... And on that note it is cooler than Byron ...

They do not take reservations so we arrived around 9 and put in our name and phone number after being told we would be seated in around an hour. We came back around 10 and were seated shortly after. The staff was extremely friendly and explained their concept thoroughly. The food:-First of all, the strawberry basil soda is just divine.-The complimentary popcorn was a fun appetizer-The salad that came along with the steak was a nice refreshing touch -The flat iron steak (although not he larger piece of meat I've seen) is ultra tender, and cooked and seasoned to perfection. It is pre cut, but they do provide a charming miniature cleaver for your slicing needs. -The peppercorn sauce is tasty and although the bowl of it looks small, I probably could have shared it with someone else. -The Aubergine (eggplant) side was super tasty and baked nicely. -The creamed spinach was probably the only disappointment as it was nothing special and a bit bland. Overall, we left super duper satisfied by this hipster joint and will be back during my future visits to London.",

    "text": "I got to try a lot of cool spots when my parents came to visit for my little brother's holiday. My dad chose Flat Iron a day we were wandering about, trying to figure out how to fill our empty screaming stomachs and oh, what a good idea. I don't remember the time we walked in but we didn't wait at all and were seated on one of the little tables. I love the decoration arrangements because I'm a fan of that industrial wooden vide, but the seating was a problem in my opinion. The tables are very narrow and we're a family of tall people and large shoulders. I wasn't at ease while I kept bumping into my mother's elbows. Same applies to the seats. We were sat on stools and, to be honest, my first reaction was \"seriously ?\". It wasn't bad at all especially because I could lean on the wall, but stools aren't ideal when eating.There was also a little problem when we ordered cocktails to start with and they came after the food... We told them it was inconvenient and that we didn't want them anymore since we didn't get the chance to drink them. They apologized, to us to keep them and offered the cocktails. Much appreciated gesture, that was a beginner's mistake.I'm done with what I didn't like, now the food. The menu offers one choice : the steak, and a large choice of sides from healthy options to less healthy options (guess what I chose). They also have a menu of the day which included a burger that day. After the waitress highly recommended it, my brother and I got the (deliiiicious) burger and my parents got the steak. We were all very happy with our dishes and sides. We also had dessert, the one of the day and the sunday. It was nice and soothing and not as heavy as I was expected. I'll go back to eat that nice steak.Side note : i LOVE the knives.",

We went through the front doors bang on 6pm and were seated straight away. The service was excellent and our waitress was super-helpful and incredibly friendly.I was tempted by the idea of a deep fried burger, but couldn't be swayed from the Flat Iron steak - I mean really, that's what you're there for right! For sides we went with the roast aubergine and chips, as well as the peppercorn sauce.And before I even get to the steak, I NEED to talk about the aubergine. It was like a little baby lasagna and I could have eaten like ten more after the one that I (begrudgingly) shared.The steak was delicious. Tender and juicy and beautifully presented on a warm stone plate. It was kind of hard to leave the restaurant and go to the show, because after my meal all I really wanted was to sit in the warm restaurant, drink some more red wine and relax into a puddle of satisfaction.",

    "text": "I came here on a total whim but I can say this was my best meal in London, by far. I originally set out for Soho in search of Mexican food. I'm Texan and had been in Southeast Asia all summer so I was dying for it. I got a little lost and couldn't find the original restaurant I had in mind so I turned to yelp for the closest affordable restaurant and it pointed me to Flat Iron. Boy, I'm sure glad I went. I came on a late Saturday afternoon and the place was quite busy, but I was seated immediately. The interior is dim with exposed brick walls so it feels like you're in a foundry... a very chic foundry. Very cool.The menu is incredibly short- the only main listed was the \u00a310 steak but when my server came by, he said that they're also serving a \u00a310 burger special. I went for the steak and ordered chips on the side. I also ordered a Strawberry and Basil Collins and it was phenomenal- crisp and refreshing. I noticed their cocktail list is incredibly affordable with all of them being between \u00a35-7 each. My food came out within 10-15 minutes of ordering. I had low expectations for such a cheap steak with what is normally a chewy cut of meat. But this \u00a310 steak totally blew me away. I've had my fair share of beef- ranging from cheap and tough to obscenely expensive cuts of meat. This is one of the cheapest steaks I've had but it was also one of the most tender. I would have preferred more seasoning besides salt, but I do appreciate that they let the natural flavor of the steak show through. Juicy, buttery, and so so tender. And for \u00a310!! Maybe because I came without reading the hype, it had no expectations to live up to but this steak was absolutely great. The chips too were perfectly crispy and tasty but they paled in comparison to the stunning steak. My server was incredibly friendly and attentive- always made sure I was satisfied and didn't have any questions. I appreciate the free popcorn and carafe of still water- a nice refreshment! The great service, chic ambiance, and amazing food has made this my best (and most affordable!) meal in London so far.",

    "text": "Pre theatre dinner on a rainy London night. We dropped into this smallish (bordering on a little cramped) and busy eatery and were quickly seated without a reservation (not sure if they take them). Clientele were a mix of locals and tourists. We got our drinks order in pretty quickly and prices were reasonable. I had the French Merlot which was quite good. The menu is simple - beef in the form of steaks or burgers from what I could see. It was a little dark down the back and the menus small font was making life tricky. So flat iron steak ordered and some sides to accompany. We did have to wait a bit for the mains but not too bad. When they arrived the steak was perfectly cooked and tender, the fries delicious, the side salad ok but slightly difficult to eat out of the enamel mug, and the greens of the day good. And all very reasonably priced. Service was ok, our waiter seemed to have disappeared and it took a little too long to flag someone down to get the bill. \u00a0Worth the visit for a meal but unlikely to be a regular spot for me.",

    "text": "After hearing all this \"10 pound steak\" news for Flat Iron, I was pretty excited to give it a try. A friend and I came here at around 5:15 pm on a weekday and it wasn't crowded at all. We were seated immediately and given a bucket of popcorn to munch on as we looked over the menu. I was already slightly disappointed by the popcorn because it tasted too buttery and heavy and I couldn't endure more than a couple pieces. Nevertheless I was still stoked for the steak.I ordered the steak (surprise surprise), cooked medium rare. It came out pretty quickly and I have to admit the plating was pretty cool. But upon the first bite I was awfully disappointed. The steak was definitely NOT medium rare - it was medium, possibly even medium well for some pieces (yes, different pieces on the same plate were cooked to different states...). As a result, most of the meat was terribly difficult to chew. There were also quite a few salt chunks on the pieces of steak, which I thought was pretty weird. More than a couple times I would have a piece and be overwhelmed by an excessive salt concentration. Most pieces were fairly seasoned, though, and I will say that the taste was generally satisfactory.Overall, I was not impressed by this place. After hearing all the rave reviews I was definitely expecting better. Even the low price doesn't justify coming here, in my opinion. I'd much rather pay more and have a better quality steak.",

Really friendly and they explained the whole concept as it was my first time. Great meat, cooked simple with simple sides to accompany it.I decided to go for the special of the day, wagyu beef and side of fries. As part of the welcome they reiterate its good meat cooked just right and advise not to go over a medium rare. I happily obliged as that is also my preference.Food came out and look good, until I cut into it. The cut was completely over cooked and there was no one around for me to grab, point out and ask them to do another. If the whole concept is about simple cooking, how could they get it so wrong. What topped it off was the fries. The top half was fresh and crispy but the bottom half stone cold and soggy. It was like they had just topped up an old batch of fries that had been sitting there. After waiting a while to speak to someone I ended up just eating, waiting again, paying and leaving. (Visit - 06/07/2015 Lunch)",

If you have ever been to the Beak Street branch, you will immediately recognise that this is a Flat Iron restaurant, although they do not yet have a sign outside - they just opened about a week ago.When I visited, the special of the day was An onglet steak, and as I never had an onglet at Flat Iron before, I decide to give it a try. It came as beautifully presented as their signature flat iron steak with the same delicious salad. Which is a remarkable thing to say for me, but I do actually like their salad, probably mainly because of the dressing. I ordered my steak with chips and once again I was very happy with that choice. The thin-cut chips are golden and crispy and all around delicious. As far as I remember, I had the Macabeo white wine before and I still quite like it. The fresh and dry white kind of works even with a steak.For dessert, I took advantage of the seasonal offer: strawberries. Overall, another excellent meal at Flat Iron. Not only is the food tasty and good-value, but the staff are also really nice and friendly. No question, I will be back soon to check out the other dessert...",

I mean, let's be honest, there's not much to choose from, oh an sorry veggie-friends, but this place has absolutely nothing to offer for you, except of salad, greens and chips.

Often because meat is fresh in and being butchered. So I long to see their specials board.This like Burger and Lobster is a simple menu with an uncomplicated idea that has a delicious meal to match. Some good Fred Sauce too. You won't go wrong in value for money here. They know their meat. Just hope they don't open TOO many branches!",

I read about the long wait times so I was a little hesitant to go in the first place - got there around 10:50pm on a Friday night and had no wait - I'm assuming the long waits are during prime dinner hours. The space is small and cozy but super cute. Full of character with brick accents, candles lights illuminating the whole space, a fireplace warming the restaurant - really amazing space. Probably the greatest thing - the menu - they serve only 1 main course - great for people like me who can't decide. There may be a special or 2 of the day but their main item is the flat iron. I got mine medium with a side of market vegetables - broccoli spouts. Portion wise - it would not be Ron Swanson approved however the flavor and tenderness were amazing. One of the better steaks I've had - cooked perfectly, flavorful and buttery. The plating was super cute - on a small hotplate with utensils consisting of a small meat cleaver! The broccoli side was great as was the strawberry basil collins. Prices were very reasonable - \u00a310 for a steak in London! And a good steak at that. Service was on point, food was great, decor was beautiful. Awesome place!",

However considering everything else is add on, it's not exactly super super budget. Sides are 2.50-4\u00a3 extra. Sauce 1\u00a3 etc so you're looking at 13-15\u00a3 all included. The salad that comes with it is useless because it is wet like it has dressing on it but tastes like water. Why put it there if you're not going to put a half decent dressing on it ?? Their reservation system is efficient: you arrive and if there aren't any tables they take your name and number and send you a text when your table is ready. We only had to wait 15 minutes at 6.30pm so we just went to browse in a bookshop across the road but you can definitely go have a drink in a pub if they tell you it's longer. Side note: I hate restaurants with stools instead of chairs. I know it's to prevent you lingering but they are so uncomfortable it actually makes me want to leave or is that just me? If you're looking for a good steak and chips at a reasonable price then Flat Iron is for you!",

    "text": "Who doesn't love a good piece of steak? When it's at a bargain price of \u00a310 a steak, there's even more to love.At Flat Iron, that's exactly what you'll get. When you're seated down, you're given a cup of popcorn to snack on. You might think this is odd, until you realise they've used the beef drippings to flavour the popcorn - giving Flat Iron another reason to be unique!The marbly steak was cooked exactly how I liked it - medium rare. Char-grilled yet \u00a0super tender. I had no complaints with it! It looked a little pink, but it wasn't bloody at all. You also get a really cool mini cleaver to cut your steak with! Each steak comes with a serving of their house salad, which is essentially some fresh greens with a simple dressing.You can also opt to spend an extra \u00a31.00 and choose one of the sauces to accompany your steak. I chose the peppercorn and was not disappointed! It was creamy and peppery, but not too overpowering, so it complimented the steak really well. Seriously worth spending the \u00a31.00!I also tried out the special item which was the burger \u00a0- simply served in a seeded bun, with shallots and a Bearnaise sauce. Don't judge a book by it's cover! Although it looked like it hadn't been put together with much care, it was definitely cooked with love. The same quality of meat as the steak, meant the burger patty was full of flavour. So overall, I had a pretty good time at Flat Iron. The steak on it's own is probably not enough to fill you. But with the sides it's a pretty pretty meal. Or if the burger is on offer, then go for that. It's a pretty cool dining experience and I'd highly recommend it. But it won't be worth it if you have to wait 2 hours, so make sure you get there early!",

    "text": "I have to say, I think this is my favourite restaurant in London.Sister restaurant to Beak Street but with it's own unique charm.Situated about a ten minute walk from Tottenham Court Road station along the unassuming Denmark Street. Subtle signage outside will need to be looked for but once you find it, you're in for a real treat.Social seating throughout but don't let this put you off, even if you're not in to this kind of thing. Lovely decor throughout. Sitting anywhere, you'll have a nice time but I prefer sitting at the back.Typically famed for it's Flat Iron steak (no surprise here). If you're not familiar it's a skirt steak, cooked only one way, rare. Not the best cut of meat you'll ever find but, honestly, one of the best you'll ever eat. Cooked and seasoned to perfection. Presented on a wooden chopping board, sliced relatively thinly. Served with a small side salad but treat yourself to a couple of sides. Chips are thin and cooked well. I would recommend the creamed spinach but they're all very good.I, up until very recently, have always had the same thing here, the steak, not wanting to pass up on the opportunity. This having been said I recently had a burger from the specials board. This may have been a mistake. A handful of burgers have ever blown my mind. Disco Bistro, Burger Tom, maybe the first time I'd had a Byron and now Flat Iron. Deep fried, simply served in brioche and with bearnaise. Just amazing. How am I going to decide what to have in the future now! (It'll be the steak, don't worry).So, I've talked about how good the food is, so what's the catch? The price? Hells no. \u00a310. That's right, you heard me. \u00a310 for one of the best steaks you'll ever have in one of the nicest restaurant in town. Amazing. Treat yourself to the French Malbec and this will be one of the best meals you've ever had.I've rarely had to queue at this venue (Beak Street is almost impossible to get into these days) but if you do have to wait. WAIT, you'll not be sorry. Pop your name on the waiting list and go and find one of the amazing bars in the area until you're called in!I love this place.",

    "text": "What can I say that hasn't been repeated already. This place is heaven for a meat lover like me. Been here twice. First time I had the onglet special, which was amazing. Last time I had just the standard cut and it was just as delicious. It's a good thing it's not too close to home or work, otherwise I'd be there every night :DThe sides are simple but also very good. Altogether makes a healthy meal if you skip chips and go for greens (kale, for example). However, I found it rather hard to resist the salted caramel ice cream dessert both times, so there goes my healthy meal. Ah well, no regrets! The service is excellent, too. All waiters and waitresses are very friendly. The first time the lady who explained me everything even sat down with me on my table, made for a more comfortable and amiable conversation, I enjoyed that. Good recommendations based on my preferences and no pressure on ordering anything in particular.About the queues... I went there twice on my own for dinner rather late (around 9) and was seated straightaway (I was lucky, I suppose, although last Friday it was just rather empty). I attempted to go with a friend on a Thursday and there was a queue of 1,5 hours, so we skipped it and went elsewhere. So it's a matter of giving it a try and if no room there's plenty other restaurants to choose from in the area.The only negative point for me is the door. People forget to close it and if it's windy it can get a little annoying. But the waiters are usually on top of this and are quick to close the door again.",

However, unlike their other location, this one doesn't seem to have a bar that you can wait in. No matter, they have a really good system that texts you to let you know when your table is available so we headed to Foyles for a drink in their cafe.A short while later, the text came through, well before their 45 minute estimate. Heading back there, we were greeted at the door and shown to our table. We ordered medium rare steaks, a portion of chips, an order of aubergine parmesan, and a side of Bearnaise sauce. All were served quickly and to be honest, tasted absolutely divine. They only serve one cut of meat on a regular basis and it shows how much practice they have had doing it. The \u00a310 cut of meat was tender, well seasoned and did not need the b\u00e9arnaise (although I still used it, I love it!). Who doesn't love chips cooked in beef fat either (well, probably not the vegetarian/vegan section of the population...).Declining dessert we opted for the check, and left.

Walk to the Craft Beer Co. and sink a few back while you wait.+ Food is primarily steaks sourced regularly from premium British suppliers, ands peculiarly cuts from the market that day/week. So options other than the central 'Flat Iron' do chance. There is not a burger permanently on the menu so don't come expecting one! One day they'll have burger, or Wagu Beef Skirt, or an 800g-1kg ribeye to share..+ Steaks are seared and placed in sous vide until steaks are cooked perfectly medium-rare (they really recommend you have it like this, but will do it to your preference). Steak comes sliced, so no need to faff about with the quirky mini-cleaver*. Served with a decent helping of house salad & dressing (lambs lettuce). - the fries, made fresh daily by a named person on the menu, are tasty but are nowhere near Honest Burger or Patty & Bun. Best grab some Fred's Sauce (a wasabi & chill-garlic blend?)- Drinks: the cocktails are meh, and the Old Fashioned wasn't impressive. Too sweet and not boozey enough by far! That said, the wine selection is solid- get the Malbec or everything French. Prefer to get some solid whiskeys to compliment the meat.+ Dessert: perfectly simple vanilla ice cream in a Sundae flute, with a pot of molten milk chocolate and a pot of molten vanilla syrup for you to pour and mix at your leisure. A great little piece of food theatre and delicious.Overall: you can eat well on \u00a320 (steak, fries, desert) and \u00a322 plus a glass of wine or a beer, if you fancy waiting. I have one massive bugbear, and some might think it's stupid:* The cleavers are blunt as blunt can be. Yes I know it's a safety issue, and yes I know the serving platters are rock and would blunt or chip the knives if used as a chopping cleaver. Yet it's massively disappointing when one of your big draws and PR hooks are these cleavers. Ron Swanson would not approve.",

This is not my favorite way to dine, but with such a small place it's really necessary to get the maximum number of seats possible. The drinks were delivered quickly and we were given a pitcher of infused water to accompany the meal. The steaks were perfect. A delicious medium rare with just the right amount of mouth-watering seasoning. Combined with the mini cleaver that is supplied instead of a knife and I couldn't resist diving in.

    "text": "A top quality steak sits pretty highly at the top of my food appreciation list - but to get that quality, it can be pretty pricey. But thanks to Flat Iron, those of us on a budget can get our steak fix without having to eat beans on toast for the next fortnight.The bare brickwork of the walls combined with a skylight and plants gives it that European 'al fresco' feel without having to deal with, y'know, actually being outside with the weather (and pigeons).Flat Iron's menu is incredibly simple - the only main course is, as you'd expect, a steak. For \u00a310, you can get the house steak with salad and then add sides - I went for the Dripping Chips, which are some of the most unbeatable chips I've ever had in the city. Crisp on the outside, soft on the inside - and the fact that the chef cooking the chips has their name up on the blackboard is a lovely personal touch. The steak itself is pretty much perfection on a plate (well, a chopping board, because plates aren't cool these days). Recommended served medium rare, it's incredibly tender, juicy, slightly seasoned and, most importantly, packed with mouthwatering meaty flavour. I'd also never experienced dessert at Flat Iron but as a treat, I decided to give the Salted Caramel Sundae a whirl. BEST IDEA EVER. The sundae comes with two tiny pots - one with a vanilla syrup and the other a chocolate sauce. The combination of soft, fresh dairy ice cream with the sauces works perfectly to quell the sweetest of teeth - and as you reach the bottom, a beautiful salted caramel surprise awaits.In total, I spent \u00a328 (including a tip) on my steak, fries, Salted Caramel Sundae and a couple of glasses of wine. Usually, the only place you'd get a steak meal including drinks for under \u00a330 is good old Spoons, so considering the epic quality of the food, it's a reasonable price. Plus, if you're REALLY stretched, the steak and salad and some tap water would only set you back a tenner (plus tip). Total bargain.",

We had six items from the menu plus the old fashion. The two steaks were perfectly prepared to order and quite delicious. \u00a0Salads were fresh and perfectly dressed. Other sides were very good. Tried one of the sauces (peppercorn) it was also very good but not necessary for the steak! Nice sundae for dessert.Waiter Marco also provided excellent advice and service!Loved it! Will definitely consider next time in London.",

    "text": "I really wouldn't consider this a true steakhouse. Flat Iron offers one kind of steak, the flat iron cut, which is known as a very lean cut. The menu is small, basically everyone gets the flat iron steak for 11 euro. Don't get me wrong, this is super cheap for a nice portioned piece of meat that they cook very well by your request. Though the meat itself is just very tough. I couldn't swallow most of it. By no means is this going to be the best piece of steak you have but its decent for the price I suppose. I'd rather go to blacklock for Sunday roast!I wish I had tried the burger though?Burger 10 euro vs. Steak 11 euro The fries were crispy and delicious! Get them!Also got the spinach dip and a few sauces- horseradish cream and the beaurniase, bithe were ok and 1 euro each.",

I liked that the black pepper sauce was kinda creamy. I dipped my steak in both sauces.The Fentiman's rose lemonade and the house made passionfruit fizz was also perfect. I'm not a fan of passionfruit BUT they used fresh passionfruit and for some reason, it was so unique and I loved it. The rose lemonade had a tint of rose which was also very yummy.Salad was just eh. It was complimentary, but too much dressing. Just whatever, but I guess it's included. I wish they put the dressing on the side so I can pour to my liking. Also did you see the knife?! It's suuuper cute, I wish I could've taken it home c(x",

We each had the house steak, a side of chips, and a sauce (peppercorn for me, Bearnaise for the hubs), alongside a carafe of delicious red wine on special. The steaks were served with tiny meat cleavers instead of a knife, which was adorable and actually very functional. For dessert, we had sea salt caramel ice cream. Everything was delicious, the ambiance was great, and the service was top notch!",

The staff was friendly and accommodating; we felt welcome right away even though the place was quite busy. It's also relatively small, yes, but it didn't feel overcrowded in a bad way. The overall concept is great and fits together very well - from the personable staff over the interior and the surprsingly bright room, the cute butcher's cleavers instead of steak knives to the fact that they serve only one kind of steak - it all works perfectly together to make your visit fun and memorable.And the flat iron steak they serve is definitely memorable. It had a very rich meaty taste and due the way it was prepared and sereved it was also astonishingly tender. Very impressive.We had fries, beans and spinach as sides and some nice, summary Lychee & Rose Martini beers from the daily recommendations.Overall, I am very glad we stumbled into The Flat Iron \u00a0as it was just an amazing guest experience.",

    "text": "I have been to Flat Iron a few times now, basically each time I visit London since being introduced to it I will go there for dinner one of the nights.When the restaurant is full you will need to join a virtual queue. The restaurant will text you when a table is ready and you get a link to check your spot in the queue. This could do with some refinement as the the link massively overestimates the time to wait. The guy at the door warned us this and said that the link will say that the wait time is four hours but it was actually about 90 minutes. Sure enough, about 90 minutes later we had our text and we headed back. Just something minor that could do with some adjustment. I'd also like to add that this was after 6pm on a Saturday night. Other times that I have been the wait time has only been about 20 minutes.The restaurant itself has a nice look and feel to it but it is awfully cosy. We ended up chatting to the women at the table next to us since the tables are only about 10cm apart. If you don't like talking to strangers then you should maybe reconsider but if you don't mind making a few new friends during your meal then go for it!As has been stated by others, the menu is very simple. There is one main: the Flat Iron steak. This steak is delicious, juicy and full of flavour. They also usually have a couple of specials and this time they had a burger as well as flank steak. My dining partner and I decided to have the Flat Iron steak and the flank steak and share half each and this was such a good decision as both steaks are absolutely delicious. We had our steaks with chips which are also very tasty, and I decided against sauce as the steaks are so tasty that I don't feel the need to add any more flavour.The staff are all so friendly and attentive but without being in your face. I have seen the same guy in there each time and he is always so pleasant and friendly when taking the orders that you just find yourself chatting away with him. Going from the receipt, I believe his name is Marco and he is an absolute credit to the restaurant.They seem to have also added Wi-Fi recently. Certainly this was the first time that my phone saw that there was Wi-Fi available. I get no phone signal in there so that was a nice extra touch.I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys a good steak. And at \u00a310 a steak it is an absolute bargain. With chips, a side if you choose, and a drink, you're talking around \u00a320 a head which is still amazing for a sit down meal in central London.",

    "text": "Cheap steak and salad for \u00a310 need I say more?!? Also you get a cute cleaver to cut up your steak! The steak is succulent and great quality. Definitely a cheap go to place for steak on the cheap. Only issue.. the wait can be from 40 mins onwards and I don't think they take reservations. You walk in ask for a table and they put you in a online queue. They then message you when your table is ready. So if you know for sure you want to eat here you can pop in get a place in the queue and plan it out accordingly.",
