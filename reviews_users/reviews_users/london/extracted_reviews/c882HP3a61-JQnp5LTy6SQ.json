Spice food, beer and nerds = winner!There is no doubt about it that the food here is wonderful, the meat was wonderfully cooked and the Chana Masala was possibly the best dish to arrive at our table. If you are dining in a large group, this place is perfect. The huge dining hall upstairs makes it a bit like school dinners but in a fun kitsch way. But I wouldn't really recommend taking a date here.It was all a bit greasy to be honest. Not that I mind, greasy adds flavour.

    "text": "One thing this American heard over and over was that while visiting London, I must be sure to try the Indian food; supposedly it is the world's best. So, what's a girl to do in a land foreign to her own, looking for some good curry and samosas? Yelp! Of course! From my hostel's Internet bar, that's just what I did- and came upon Lahore Kebab House. Choosing this restaurant based on the other 20 reviews was easy- convincing my international party of 8 was not. Luckily for me, my only 2 to-dos while in London were going to Ministry of Sound, and eating Indian food. Due too much fun being had, we missed out on M.O.S., so my friends finally caved in and let me lead them on a few tubes across town- in the rain- to Lahore. Walking there from the tube stop at night in the rain seems a bit sketchy for about 5 minutes. The glowing lettering of the sign was a welcome relief to ease our fear and also to ease our hunger pangs. The restaurant was packed- which was a very good sign. It was mostly Indian and Pakistani patrons, and one group of white people. I can't assume they were English, since my group was comprised of an American, some Canadians, Germans, and an Aussie. We were greeted and seated, and immediately ordered 2 pitchers of mango lassie- thanks to a review I had read. Only one of my German friends had even heard of \"lassie\" before- but once it was delivered to the table, we all became immediate fans. It's a cold drink, almost like a smoothie- and it's ridiculously good. We ended up going through 3 pitchers for the 8 of us. We had a tiny bit of difficulty understanding our waiter through his thick accent- especially my \"foreign\" friends. Thankfully, I live in LA, and could pretty much make out any accent, and what he was saying, so I ended up being the main communicator for our group. We each had an entree, shared a huge platter of rice, and devoured almost every appetizer they offer. Everything was SOOO GOOD. It's one of those places where you keep eating, even if you're already full. Yes, I want to try my neighbour's food. Yes, I want another chicken stick. Yes, I need to drink more of this amazing \"lassie\" stuff. Chicken tikka and chicken masala were popular at my table, but probably only because I could explain those items to my friends, and many of them had never had Indian food before., One of my favourite parts of the evening were the dishes the food was served in. They are the actual little metal pots and tins that the food was cooked in on the stove- meaning, they did not transfer the food to a \"pretty\" serving plate. It is added to the authenticity of it all, and probably kept the food warmer longer. Another favourite of mine was watching the locals eat. It was obvious that this restaurant was a favourite among them too, and that we were doing something right- since we had just as many plates on our table as they did theirs. When we had all stuffed one last piece of garlic naan into our cheeks for the ride home, we asked for the bill, sad that we could not enjoy some sort of popsicle-type thing that many of the other patrons were having for dessert. I couldn't figure out what they were- but they looked amazing. There was just no more room! The check was extremely reasonable- I think about 15 pounds each... and it was definitely some of the best money any of us had spent on the trip. So yes, if you ever find yourself in London, you need to try the Indian food. It's better than anything I've ever had in LA, and totally worth riding home on the tube smelling of curry!",

It seemed like it is usually packed, and the long hall room dining tables upstairs makes you feel as though you found an authentic slice of India. I tried the chicken, lamb, and green potato curry. The lamb chops were good too. Watch out tho, it's spicy here. There's not much to say about the service because this place is so busy the waiters have to serve you on the run, but this doesn't matter because between talking to new people over the din of the restaurant while trying to extinguish the fire in your mouth with beer you'll be having too good of a time to care. Lahore is more of a \"get stuck in there\" kind of place than a conventional \"hi, my name is Francois and I'll be your waiter this evening\". Don't dress up, in fact the curry stains badly, just come as you are and be ready to have fun trying great Indian food in an authentic Indian setting.",

It's best to go between Wednesday and Sunday inclusive. This is when they serve an AWESOME Pakistani dish called \"nehari\". It's so great that if I try and describe it I would be doing it severe injustice. It's quite busy so you may have to wait a bit to go in (I'm not 100% sure if they take bookings so you might want to check - I live 5 minutes away so I just showed up after calling to check if it was busy). The staff are friendly and mean well but in busy times it may be difficult to get their attention. It's also a bring-your-own-booze restaurant so those of you inclined that way may like that - I don't drink so I wouldn't know how much value that adds to your dining experience. Also make sure you order the saag alu, chicken and seekh kebabs, and a kebab roll (in addition to the nehari of course!)",

And for the spice, well thats how curries should be - Fragrant, full of flavour and spicy. It originated from Asia.. Duh..  One wierd thing is that the drinks always comes really late to your table. Every time I had to remind them. And it was just not for my table. It was almost every table. But they are smart.. Very smart.. I think they want you to start drinking the bottled water on the table first. Very cheeky tactic but I have not succumbed. (Pats self of the back)After every visit I had to unbutton my jeans.

This is (though debatabley) the be-all, end all curry experience and if you ever find yourself in London you simply have to go. Everything I ate -- and boy, did I ever eat -- was outstanding. At our table was Chicken Tikka Masala, Sag Gosht, Sag Paneer, Chana Masala, Chicken Biryani and assorted naans as well a few other dishes that though tasty, I'd never seen before. Oh, and the Friday lamb chops, of course, were quite good. So here's the thing, if you are used to Indian food being a certain way, you may need to get over that fact. You may find this stuff slightly different (it is actually Pakistani, after all), but I promise, once you put aside your expectations your taste buds are in for a fun ride.Remember to go to the Off License next door to grab a few 40s of King Fisher (or whatever the Brits call 40 ounce bottles of beer). Lahore does not serve beer and wine, but will happily allow you to consume what you bought next door. And if you like Bollywood music videos, you're in for a treat, they have them playing on the flat screens. I always think that adds something, but who doesn't like a movie where they break out in song for no reason?",

I preferred Tayyabs for the same goal -- getting off Brick Lane, finding good curry and a fun BYOB atmosphere.We ate vegetarian here, so I can't speak for their meat dishes, but the chana masala and mixed veg curry were good. Not blow your mind good, but \"I'd eat that again\" good.Try it. You'll probably like it.",

You go here for the relatively cheap food and the abundance of space (massive canteen style dining upstairs). You don't however go here if you like to have the waiter be more attentive than an autistic zombie as trying to get there attention is an exercise in futility. You rock up, you order food, they toss it on the table, and you never see him again until you've begged to pay the bill. Or maybe that was just us.Unfortunately, it's just not cheap enough to justify it. Tayyabs is just a little further away and only slightly pricier but miles ahead in terms of quality of location, service, and dare I say flavour. I'm not anti-Lahore, just a bit disappointed it didnt' live up to my rosy memories of Lizzie's curry night there as my first UYE. But, it does have tvs and the game on so if you are looking for an Indian pub, Lahore is exactly what I imagine it would be.Oh, and careful about the toilets. They are dirtier than the average one in India and that's saying something.",

Would anyone be willing to be my sponsor?---I could make a meal out of Lahore's spicy lamb chops. In fact, I might as well have, because we ordered two portions for two people, and it was enough to be filling.... but then I would have missed out on the gluttony of butter chicken, saag paneer, and fluffy naan that ensued.All this, washed down with some frosty Kingfisher, obtained around the corner at the local offie ( which probably does most of its custom as a function of its proximity to Lahore...).I love that the men's toilet offers your choice of four different hand soaps, and yet I still see people walk out after peeing sin lavan los manos. Didn't y'all learn in school that washing your hands is the best protection against illness?! Not okay.It's a testament to the nomminess of the grub that 1) I'm willing to return, 2) I'm willing to overlook other diners' unsanitary behaviour, and 3) I'm willing to haul over here from Knightsbridge after an afternoon ogling the goods at Harrods.Respect.",

I just don't get over love easily and since Tayyabs captured my heart early on, I'd still have to say it ranks higher.Here's the low-down: you're going to get delicious food at both Lahore and Tayyabs. Our feast of biryani, tarka, samosa, bhajia, paneer, aloo, chops, masala, curry, jalfrezi, among other dishes was stunning. So if you're debating between Lahore and Tayyabs, it comes down to these questions: 1. Do you want to sit down within ten minutes and not have to deal with hordes of pushy people?2. Does ambiance mean little to nothing to your overall dining experience? (Think high ceilings, bright overhead lights, yellow walls and cafeteria style seating)If you answered YES to both of these questions, then Lahore is for you. They skip the \"experience\" of a smokey dark underground curry house in favour of quick, delicious, accessible food. (This also then skips the horribly long wait that inevitably includes arguing with the host and being man-handled by the comers and goers.)Funnily enough, I almost missed the above experience during my visit to Lahore. Apparently, I'm a sucker for those hard-to-get, bad boy curry houses. Figures. Once you've fallen in love, and fallen hard - even if your next partner is stunning, beautiful, kind, generous... that first love will always haunt you.",

Because Lahore certainly is another candidate for the Emperor's New Clothes award, a restaurant that is not that good but inexplicably has generated a lot of kudos. When we first arrived I thought we were in the wrong place. If it looks like a dodgy kebab house and smells like a dodgy kebab house, then don't be surprised when it is. Inside it looks like a hospital canteen, with wide-screens on the wall showing the football. While I'm eating. Super. The menu isn't very big, but that can be fine if the food is amazing. It isn't. I thought everything was greasy and overly spicy. The naan bread was not good, they brought plates of dips and salad but no popadoms. Why? Where are my popadoms? (I realise I have no idea how to spell poppadoms, neither does Firefox, do you?) The lamb chops that this place is famous for were distinctly unimpressive and fatty. It seemed like they just masked the mediocrity with a lot of spices. I'd never go back. Maybe for the mango lassi. And if you were paying.",

Who knows?For my friends last evening in London, she wanted 'Brick Lane' curry. Well for one, especially to those Trip Advisor reviewers, this is NOT Brick Lane. As a matter of fact, it's 10 minutes away and corners the high street and an alley.Large restaurant. Very busy. Lots of tables all covered with white. White walls. Definitely a place where you bring the ambiance. And decorations.We went pretty standard (and steered clear of red meat after a weekend in Romania and spiced inced meat stuffed into everything). Chicken tikka masala and Butter chicken. Garlic naan. Pilau rice. And sag paneer (a fave of mine). The chicken tikka masala came 1 minute after ordering. They must have a large vat they spoon it from. Eventually followed the rest of the food. Naan and rice the last two brought out. The sag was decent. Which really sucked because I LOVE sag paneer and it's such a standard, I didn't think they could screw it up. The chicken dishes were ok, definitely spicy hot. We even asked a 2nd time if one dish was actually the butter chicken. Really don't think it matched what we're previously ordered elsewhere.It took a while to get someone for a check. The second we put our credit cards n the machine, three men came in our way to clear our table. We came. We ate. We over-ordered. We didn't overpay. We walked away thinking meh. Next time, it's Brick Lane - any joint - for us. Nothing special here.",

Highly recommend the lamb chops, the bhindi / ladyfingers, shish kebab, plain naans. These recommendations mean: you HAVE to order them. And if you are not in London, hop on a plane and try them, dammit!We ordered so much and everything was just perfect. Big hand to the chefs! Love u guys!Don't be put off by the simple interior, this is no classy I-only-eat-organic-salad-with-gold-sparlkes design place. This is where the love for food was born and it still lives there.",

We came around 6 on a Saturday so the restaurant was still fairly empty when we arrived, but by the time we left there was a queue out the door and the whole place had taken an entirely different atmosphere. First of all the venue is huge; looks something like a cafeteria, and on the left side there are glass windows through which you can see the kitchen but that are quickly steamed over. I was told to go big on the appetizers and to definitely order the grilled lamb chops; they did not disappoint. The chicken tikka was good too but the big draw of the place is the atmosphere: go with a big party, bring a lot of wine, and take it for what it is: young, cheap London at its best",

Service? \u00a0Pretty much tossed out the window!We were trying to flag down the waiter to place our order for about the past 20 minutes. \u00a0During that time, we also ordered still water, and a jug of mango lassi - both which had to be repeatedly asked for.And its kinda funny - you ask one guy for something, and he delegates it to someone else, who delegates it to someone else, and it gets lost in the jumble. I understand that some people say that with cheap food, you get what you pay for. \u00a0I'd probably go here rather than the Brick Lane specials, but I would rather go somewhere else where I could actually get some service. We ordered 3 mains, a jug of mango lassi, 3 naan and rice, and I *think* 3-4 appies, which came to about \u00a375 (25pp) - maybe its my Asian roots, but for that type of service, I dont think the price is cheap enough!",

However, finding a table for 1 is super easy so I didn't queue for too long.I started with a couple of tasty kebabs and then tried a main dish. I wish I had more patience and had tried more dishes but everything that went into my mouth was tasty. You may end up leaving smelling like kebabs so plan your evening accordingly.

    "text": "Really impressed by the lamp chops here - thanks to all the other yelpers who commented and recommended on this dish! I ate the lamb chops as an entree (a bit too spicy for me, but asked for lemon to dilute the taste of the rub, and also had it with yogurt) and the since it was a Friday special, also got the lamb chop curry. But I'm starting this review all topsy-turvey!So, to start from the beginning, our rental place is in the Whitechapel area, and when I put in curry house in Yelp as the search term, this place and Tayyab came up tops. Tayyab didn't have a booking available for 7:15, but this place did, so lucked out! Because when we got here, the lines were starting and we were ushered right into the dining room, past some other people waiting for free tables. and I felt a little sorry for them cause the smells were mouth-watering and none of that stale oil or burnt curry powder smell was emanating, so I had high hopes for the food (which were fulfilled!) After being seated in a corner table, got tap water, and raita plus a lovely salad of onions, tomatoes, and lettuce and then for entrees we split a samosa (decent) and the lamb chop as an entree dish. We got like 8-9 chops, perfectly seared, thinly sliced and bursting with flavour. Loved it! Then I ordered lamb chops curry with a garlic naan, my mum got palak paneer with wholemeal roti, and my cousin got butter chicken with garlic naan as well. I really loved the flavours of my dish - it was meaty pieces of lamb, swimming in a sea of prefect spices and because the lamb was on the bone, I got some bone marrow mixing its umami flavours in the curry sauce, so just utter deliciousness in each bite. I liked my cousin's chicken and re: my mum's pick, I liked the palak more than the paneer (a rarity for me), but for my palate, the lamb here totally is the star.I was full so didn't get any dessert but mum and my cousin got gulab jamun (2 pieces in a serve). I had a taste and it was decent, but am not a gulab jamun girl - my cousin and mum were very happy tho' \u00a0and reckoned it was home-made. I ended the meal with a pan (oh yeah! Perfect ending). The total was \u00a342 between the three of us, so def great value for money and really good service too! Def recommend and hope to be back!",

We've had big parties and raved to many friends about this formerly amazing establishment, not to mention having them join us.My business associate and I went for dinner. The onion bhajia was soggy and tough. The Tandoori Prawns were so overcooked, we sent them back. The next round was a bit better, but not much. The chilli nan had no kick. Bland! It used be to our challenge of who could eat one as it was so hot. We paid our check and left before ordering dinner.My business associate is the person who introduced me to LaHore 15 years ago. He asked for the owner and the owner's son came over. The son would not look at us and was quite rude with his attitude. Yes, my associate was furious and embarrassed about our experience and did drop the \"F\" bomb but apologized quickly. The owner's son could not let that go. Respect is earned, not a privilege. As we left, the son said to my associate, \"We have thousands of customers, we don't need you.\" Need I say more?Our waiter was new and tried his best to make the situation right. His efforts were appreciated. After hopping into a taxi, the driver knew all about the situation. The staff and particularly the kitchen, has no respect for the son. The word on the street is that LaHore is done. It's only a matter of time. The staff evidently want a real restaurant manager but the father is determined to stand behind his son and not face the reality that his son is just not cut out for this work given his upbringing. Bringing in a serious restaurant manager may save this landmark. If not, it will continue to go down the tubes. Just read the recent reviews. So sad. As for us, we say thank you for 15 years of memorable dining! We are sad to say \"Farewell!\"",

The food emerged in a timely fashion; the large restaurant was bustling for sure with what seemed like lots of families and locals. As for wetting our whistles, we ignored the non-free water bottle plopped down but instead both ordered mango lassis. You can get them in a jug if you are addicted but it'd be advisable to have more than two diners for a jug. The lassis were fruity and not to sweet; we were happy with them.We had ordered sag paneer and lamb korma. They were both on the spicy side but I managed to get thorough the flames okay. All right, it wasn't that bad, I kid. Very flavorful and fair portion sizes. The garlic nan was slightly rubbery and had sprinkles of cilantro which I dislike. Nice rice though. You have to order nan and rice separately from the mains.The bathroom was okay but if you don't have to use it, that's probably for the best.Paying was an ordeal. At first, the two of us were sitting around, obviously done, and no staffer did anything. So we asked one person. No check. Another person. No check. Minutes slipped by. There was probably another request in there that fell onto deaf ears. We were ready to pay for nearly 30 minutes. Finally, a pair of diners seated next to us well after we had started eating happened to ask for the check, so we were able to piggyback our bill request onto theirs. Finally. It was like pulling teeth. I want to give you money, why are you thwarting us?I left feeling irked that we had wasted a lot of time sitting around. And I felt really guilty that I had suggested this place too. Whoops. What a shame though, since Lahore's food was actually good. Oh well, two stars it is.",

There were 3 of us including 1 vegetarian. We shared poppadoms, 2 starters; (onion bhaji & paneer tikka). Then 2 mains (one chickpea and one okra), a rice and 2 naan. We could barely finish it all if we'd ordered one each I wouldn't have made it out the place. All of it was so different and delicious. And it came to \u00a310 each including a tip. Ridiculous.

    "text": "I will make it easy for you - 'Original Lahor Kebab House' \u00a0easily qualifies to be one the best Indian food experience I have had outside India. To give some background on our experience - I live in US and recently traveled to London on Vacation with my partner. I have been to England before, so I knew that there are some good Indian restaurants. After having been to many Americanised Indian restaurants in US, I was very much looking forward to eat some authentic food. We stayed near East Aldgate station in London and we planned to get there and try an Indian restaurant nearby. Except when we were actually there, the neighborhood had so many Indian restaurants to choose from, we weren't sure which one to choose. But after poring over so many reviews in various websites, we decided on 'Original Lahore Kebab house'. (The restaurant is also just walking distance from whitechapel neighborhood).The restaurant is not much to look at from outside and inside but boy do they make some tasty spicy food. You don't need any reservation, they have plenty of space inside with lot of tables. The place does get quiet noisy when they are busy but that's a minor inconvenience for me. You are not going to bring a first date here for sure. We ordered, 1) Saag Gosht2) Chicken Karahi3) Garlic naan4) Jug of Mango Lassi***Mango lassi - You can order either by Glass or by Jug; and obviously, ordering by Jug gives better value for money as you kind of get 5 glasses worth of Lassi for three glasses price. My partner is kind of a mango lassi freak, so we ordered the jug even though it was too much for two. One thing to note here - the lassi is quiet sweet and creamy without any hint of sourness. Traditionally, the lassis are made from curd that are at least bit sour. Don't mistake me, we loved the mango lassi here but if you are someone who is not totally sold on completely sweet lassis, you may want to get just a glass. ***Chicken Karahi comes in small tava, oily and spicy red - you know, like how you usually get Chicken Karahi. We even asked for extra spicy and they gave us finger licking, eye watering, lips quivering spicy food. Perfection. But seriously, they could do with less oil though. ***Saag Gosht - It was our favorite dish of the day. Spinach and goat meat works so well together and add some naan to the mix, you got yourself a heavenly meal! MUST TRY!Also, the food came out pretty fast. As for service, they may not come to your table and actively smiling and asking if you are okay, but if you ask something they usually make sure you are covered. Pretty efficient overall. If you are in the neighborhood of whitechapel or east aldgate, check this place out - it's totally worth a visit!",

Then comes the meat and carbs: karahi gosht, karahi kebabs, haleem, dry lamb, dal tarka, and mince curry. And for the breads you should get the garlic naan and peshwari naan. However full you are after all of this, you have to still get the keema biryani. You're well covered for desserts too--ras malai, kulfi, and the gulab jamun. The best part is no matter how busy the place is, you'll get served super fast. Which is why it is the best for when you're feeling especially ravenous. Final word--of you live in London, go here.",

Of south east origin, and growing up in a country where you savour all kinds of food due to its unique and quirky multi ethnicity, you can take my word for it. It's good, really good. However this is not a place if you want smiley waiters and small talks with the staff, it's attentive and they get it sorted out for you with efficiency and then leave you to it. \u00a0Come on people, time to try Lahore!",

Well from the inside as well. In fact a few of the people in our group decided they did not want to try the place because it looks as it does. Their loss! \u00a0seriously though this was probably the best Indian food that I have had in my life. Most places to get Currys that I have been too just don't make it properly. Sometimes you get a good one and this was certainly that experience.The service in the restaurant just can't be beat either. You ask for something and it's there almost before you can finish your sentence. On top of that the guys were really helpful and always in a good mood.I won't go down the list of everything we ordered because with a group of 15 like we had there was a lot. I tried most of what was on the table and can't say that anything was bad. There was a few that stood out but just choose what you normally like and you won't be disappointed. This is on my must go to list for London.",

    "text": "Having read previous reviews I was expecting great food and less than great service. Instead, we got great service but less than great food. Obviously it's personal opinion but I thought the lamb chops (mentioned by so many as being wonderful) were tough and overdone. The lamb curry and karahi chicken were okay but nothing special (again, the lamb was tough). A mixed vegetable curry we also ordered was kind of tasteless and there wasn't much of it. On the other hand, the chilli naan and vegetable samosas were both very good. The sweet lassi was okay but noticeably inferior to the same drink I've been served elsewhere. Ambience wasn't enjoyable (it was nearly empty when we arrived but soon became crowded and very noisy). But, as I mentioned, the service was fine: the man who served us was very pleasant and helpful.Price-wise, I thought it was a tad expensive, certainly for the quality. On the other hand, meat is a relatively expensive ingredient, so I suppose it is to be expected that meat-based dishes are more expensive than vegetable-based ones. Not sure about the quality of the meat here, though, or whether it was just overcooking that spoiled it.",

Walking right by it outside, I was upset thinking the place was closed, as I couldnt really see anything going on through the glass window, or hear a sound. I walked around the corner to the side entrance, and slowly crept through the door. Suddenly, I was transformed to a whole other atmosphere. A busy kitchen cooking and sizzling, laughter and chatter from the dining room - it was fairly packed! The seating area is large, and we were seated straight away. After realizing the place is BYOB, I ran off to the off-license next door and grabbed some beers! We ordered curries that were specials for the weekend - the dry lamb, lamb chop curry (friday only) and the chicken curry. All were spectacular, and each had its own real distinct flavour. For starters we ordered the seekh kebab and the masala fish. While the fish was tasty, I recommend sticking to the grilled meats. So. Damn. Good. The butter naan was a hot buttery pillow of heaven. GET IT. Definitely will be returning!",

The restaurant decor looks basic, but I was most impressed by the food.I ordered the chicken tikka masala and the mattar paneer. I got us some biryani rice, a garlic naan and a couple of cokes to have them with. When I opened the bag of treats back where we were eating dinner, I found a bonus salad and a yoghurt dip.The chicken tikka masala was hotter than I had expected. My lips were burning a bit so I relied on a coke to balance it out. I really should have had this with the yoghurt dip; I expect that the combination would have worked well, but I didn't try this until right at the end. The chicken itself was succulent.The mattar paneer was a new thing for me. It is a mild curry of cheese cubes and peas in a mild sauce. My wife and I both liked this.The naan was bready and well seasoned, but I was too full to finish it.The meal was great value at just over \u00a320. I learnt that they have special dishes which are only available on some days of the week. The guy taking my order at the restaurant recommended the lamb chops curry which you can only get on Fridays. I think this place will be worth another try for that one.",

It's that easy to make me happy.Here's my tips for you:- try to go early on a weekend evening (around 6:30ish or 7) as you won't have to queue up then!- if you want to drink alcohol, you must bring your own alcohol (as there are multiple BYOB restaurants in this area, all the off-licence shops have well-stocked fridges ;-)- the menu can get quite overwhelming and so far every time I've been here, I've ordered different things. However, you can't go wrong with the lamb chops (a must) and I also highly recommend the Chana Masala- do take your time and place a few orders first and then another set of dishes; the waiters don't love it, but they just have to suck it up ;-)Hope you'll enjoy this as much as I always do.",

The lamb was good but like everything else we had was secretly spicy. Not like an in your face spicy but like that one weird neighbor staring at you over your backyard fence, it just creeps up on you. When ordering the chicken samosa I just assumed that it would be a plate of small ones but they literally just bring you one...so ask for multiples if that's what you want or just sing one is the loneliest number when you get your one samosa on a plate. But it was good even though the dough was a bit too thick which made it difficult to chew. The beef biryani was good, brought to the table super hot and was so spicy for me personally that it made my lips swell. Dinner and free lip plumping, what a deal. The chicken tikka masala was also good and the chicken was super tender. The star of the show for me was the cheese naan. The cheese was actually inside the two layers of naan instead of on top like I assumed. It was tender, cheesy, but not overbearing. All in all, the food was good and you won't be mad at it.",

The Lamb chops were decent.But was quite surprised with how good the curries and breads were.Overall - can't beat a place where 10 people eat like kings and spend 23GBP each (not counting BYOB beers from the \"Off-license\" next door).One word of warning - large groups are seated upstairs... which means you maybe seating next to 30 people on a \"Stag\" chanting and chugging and being obnoxious as is to be expected with such a thing... but definitely changes your noise level altogether.",

The best thing about this place is it is BYOB which means that you can buy your booze next door and bring it in.There is nothing much to write about the decor or service as it is just functional which is OK for a place of this nature. From a food perspective, being brutally honest, I personally found the food to be just average \u00a0compared to some of the other similar Pakistani or Indian eateries I have been to. Food is served hot and is flavoursome but not exceptional. May be I felt this way because I am extremely picky when it comes to the sub-continental cuisine and don't get impressed easily. It is definitely a good place to hang out in a group drinking and eating variety of meat dishes and they do have a non-rushed service so you end up having a really nice time. The food is also reasonably priced for this part of London plus getting the booze from the store means you don't burn a hole in your pocket. Don't \u00a0go here for the food alone as you might be a tad disappointed.",

The Karahi was just a regular lamb curry with a slight runny tomato base texture nothing close to a karahi dish from Pakistan. \u00a0Paya was ok but the spices they used were so over powering the pungent paya flavour didn't come through. Seekh kebab were somewhat burnt and dry not juicy enough. Nihari - there was just gristle fat on the bone no solid meat and no dressing (traditionally sliced ginger and coriander) Naan was really good especially the Rogani naan and our waiter was very friendly hence the two stars. I guess it's a hit and miss depending on what dish you order. I think I would've been happy with a keema naan and possibly lamb chops as they looked good. My search for authentic Lahore Nihari, Paya and karahi is still on.",

This placed was PACKED on a Thursday night! Local Pakistanis and visitors alike. We ended up having to wait a short while for a table. This is BYOB and there is a convenient bottle shop right next door with plenty of beers and vino. The service was a bit slow - however the food made up for it!! Papadum - very good, hard to go wrong. Would have been nice with some accompaniments Veggie samosa - great pastry! very light on the filling though - needed more. Reminded me of Christmas from all the all spice. Onion Bhajia - very good. This is the style where all the individual pieces are battered, instead of an Onion ball. Heavy on the chickpea flourSeekh (Lamb) Kebab - exceptional flavor, great spices. Juicy kebab - not dry at all.Garlic and Peshaweri naan breads - a bit disappointed in the naan. Not as pillow-y fluffy as I'm used to/enjoy Chicken Tikka Masala - flavors were perfect. Really spicy - yummm!!The meat itself was a tiny bit dry, but could just be that it's breast meat, which usually dries out faster. Lamb Jalfrezi - very succulent slow cooked lamb pieces. The sauce was not as good as the Chicken Tikka Masala. Equally as spicy though!!Highly recommended for authentic Pakistani food!! Excited to go back and try even more dishes.",

If you're visiting this neighborhood, you'll instantly recognize the familiar shops and eateries that are associated with the Indo-Pak subcontinent. This was a little out-of-the-way, but entirely worth it. When we entered the restaurant I was surprised to see more tourists vs. the usual local crowd. We were then greeted by a waiter, seated, and brought a menu with quite a few options. Every item on the menu was very reasonably priced, and ranged from \u20ac6-15. We ordered the mixed grill which consisted of chicken tikka, lamb tikka and seekh kabobs. We also ordered a bowl of Nihari (traditional spicy beef stew) along with plenty of naan. In terms of quality, I've never eaten Pakistani food this good. The meats were all very succulent and tender, and the Nihari was savory as well as spicy. For the spice level, I was amazed and impressed to see that many non-Pakistani/Indian people handled it in the restaurant with far less water than us \u00a0For a family of five, we ended up spending something close to \u20ac10 per person which was very reasonable considering the quantity as well as quality. 5/5 would highly recommend.",

The food was amazing and when my tongue stops burning, I will be back for more. This is as authentic as it can be in London for Indian food. It's not fine dinning. None of that fusion stuff from Dishroom (which is also nice btw). We dined on the second floor, which is a bit more noisy. But as soon as we walked in, it felt like I was in India again. You can't go wrong with the menu. It's all good. My only recommendation is get the Nahari, which is stewed lamb knuckles in spicy curry. It was to die for. Look out for the weekend specials too. No questions about it, coming back again!",

When I told our server we had been given the wrong dish, he told me that it was in fact chicken jalfraizi-- which was a lie... either he couldn't be bothered to correct the mistake, or they were out of chicken jalfraizi.

The only thing I was wondering is the word kebab..as you don't immediately think of fancy dining once you hear that. But I was glad to discover that the food was amazing, tasty, and also the vegetarian options were good. The food is also very spicy and the waiter though it was well funny when we struggled with our chilli, but was kind enough to bring us some extra plain yoghurt.The place is very lively and as mentioned, always packed, but the service was so kind and fast that it is worth the wait. The customer's are a mixed bag with entire families with kids running around and business man's in their suits -everyone just seems to love the place!",

I did think it was very good, but I think Tayyab's is better. We ordered the mixed grill. Lamb chops - good but a bit dry. Chicken: surprisingly great, and so moist! The seekh kebab was also great. The lamb biryani was good, but wasn't quite what I was used to. It had a tomato-based sauce mixed in with it. The other curries were done well. But I am spoiled.The restaurant is BYOB, and there is an off-license right across the street.Gluten-free notes: With this type of cuisine, there is a lot you can eat. No naan.",

My friends had lamb and rice which they said was very tasty but spicy, my other friend had a curry which was very tasty.Highly recommend this place.I go to their Hendon branch my old boss and workmates use to take me here for lunches!Each time i try something new and their food is just delicious!I bit too spicy i tend to break out in a sweat sometimes eating the curries!",

They bought a place to stand out of the rain, added garden furniture (since replaced) and after its discovery by \"Time Out\" they expanded and refurbished entirely to deal with the crowds. Thankfully the food is unchanged, although the kitchen no longer catches on fire, and the service remains friendly if chaotic.I've never had their vegetarian options and probably never will (my dad would disappove). The only sensible way to eat here is to order a pile of kebabs and lots of roti or naan. They also have excellent curries but beware that the sauce is where the really hot chili lurks, masochists should try a spoonful from the bottom. A mango lassi is a good counterpoint to the hot stuff.The place is completely unpretentious, cheap, fast and tasty. Hopefully it stays the same for another thirty years.",

Yes, the decor leaves a lot to be desired, but, head there in the evening and the place is usually packed - atmosphere sorted.When I visited we ordered only starters and kebabs. The lamb chops were divine, if a little too spicy. The samosas were a bit disappointing, but the kebabs more than made up for it. And the chicken wings were pretty damn good too. The kebab meat was served on massive plates, with a tower of pitta-like bread to wrap with. All in all truly delicious.I suppose one of the best things about this place is the fact that it's byo. Also, there's a small shop just opposite that serves large bottles of Tiger and Kingfisher for that authentic experience. The waiters were very helpful and even kept our bottles in their fridge to keep them nice and cold. The best part of the meal was the bill. For five people eating starters and a couple of kebabs, the whole thing came to \u00a312 a head. Could not believe it. Total bargain, will be going again soon, even if means venturing a bit off the beaten track.",

I wanted to eat *more.* \u00a0It was so much better than my first experience I could hardly believe this was the same restaurant. \u00a0It was as if the fact that my friend had ordered in Hindi had put a spell of addictive flavour on the food.Afterwards, all I could think was: Hmmm... I'm never coming back here without someone who can speak the waiter's language and tell him that even though it may not look like it, I really can handle the \"real deal.\"",

    "text": "Lahore Kebab House is a welcome break for East Londoners who are tired of the crap that is regularly passed off as Indian food in Brick Lane. Its not a kebab shop as most Londoners would imagine a kebab shop to be. Its a proper restaurant and LKH serves some of the best and most affordable Indian (primarily Punjabi) food in London.First let me be clear that this place has its negatives. Its not ideal for a business meeting, its absolutely dreadful as a date place and its too noisy for a quite meal. In fact its good for just one thing ... to go and eat :)Try the seekh kebab for starter. At just 1 pound, its an awesome bargain ... and also tasty. LKH doesn't serve alcohol, so we always order a pitcher of thick mango lassi (strongly recommended). You get ~ 6 glasses of the stuff at a price of 2. The food is well cooked and well presented. The service usually ranges from average to very good (depends on who is the waiter serving you). Once the person serving us got us a wrong dish. Not only did he get us the correct one, he left the earlier dish, didn't charge for it, and also refused a tip that day. Not an incident one can easily forget.The gravies are oily ... probably a bit too oily for my liking ... but i guess thats just the price you pay for tasty Indian food. That makes this place non-repeatable, unlike some of its competitors.I suggest you should reserve a table if you are going on a weekend evening. Even with two floors of dining space, most people still end up waiting for some time at least on arriving.There is no special item that i can recommend. The menu is very standard, and they make most of the stuff well. So just go along with your usual preference.LKH is unbelievably good value for money, and hence a must visit for anyone who enjoys cheap,good Indian food.P.S: If any one you ever get a bill of more than 20 pounds per head, just tell me how managed it. Please do :)",

The friend who introduced me to this place is known for her love of trendy bars, but also for sussing out the most authentic and obscure eateries. Lahore Kebab House certainly qualifies in the slightly obscure category. We were warned only to get starters, but they were more than enough. Each one was about the size of a normal main course in itself. Everything we tried here was delicious, to the extent that you find yourself trying to eat as much as you can, which is not a good tactic as you feel it for hours afterwards, and end up waddling home like a drunken penguin. If you are eating here, remember to bring your own wine. There are a couple of off-licenses nearby, so even if you forget, it is not the end of the world.",
