I'll probably try again in the future, though.",

    "text": "I got to know about Honest Burgers through Daniel Young's Top 10 Burgers in London list at youngandfoodish.com/lond\u2026 , where Honest Burgers is currently ranked #7. I don't want to discuss any ranking, but I can state that at honest Burgers in Brixton you definitely get a delicious burger. When I arrived on the early evening, I had to wait for about 15 minutes, they said I would have to wait for 20 minutes. So, while waiting I popped into French & Grace a few stalls down the alley for a coffee and some reading (actually, it's interesting that almost everywhere you get chatted up when you read in the recently released Londoners by Craig Taylor at the moment). As promised I got a missed call as notification when I could head back. Nice service. And after the waitress explained that I shouldn't pick up, because it's her phone, you also get the her number without needing to ask for it, if that's relevant to you. I guess that's subject to change. As soon as I was seated I got the menu. You don't have much choice anyway. Chicken, beef, veggy. Period. Almost. Of course I went for the Honest Burger with cheese and bacon. As drink I opted for homemade lemonade, that's almost always a good choice. I don't know how long I had to wait for my food, but I didn't mind anyway. It's a quite small restaurant with the kitchen right behind the counter, so you can see the chefs fiddling around with the food. The burger was really very very tasty, just a bit small. Not too small, but also not too big. The chips are among the best chips I've had in London so far. Nicely spiced with rosemary, or whatever, probably a little bit too salty, but good in size and cooked to the point, if it is appropriate to say that for chips. The only real downside of enjoying a great (though not large) burger there is that they don't serve any desserts. I guess they simply have no space to prepare and store desserts in the small kitchen area, but despite I liked the (cute) light French accent of the second waitress, having no desserts at all put me off a little bit, resulting in only four stars. But after all, if you like chips and burgers, it should be a safe bet to go there.",

    "text": "The last review of the year. It could only really be a burger right? And this one was a long shot. I've tried and failed to get a seat here before (and I really can't queue, especially not for fast food...) Luckily enough, I found myself with a hunger, in Brixton Market, at just the right time...Rough and ready doesn't come close to describing the friendly little hole in the wall, at 12:10 it's already on the way to fullness, before my meat materialises it's standing room only. Interior decor is minimal, and that's being kind, though they've got the fundamentals - a scattering of tables, a small grill and a beer fridge... What more do you need? They don't have a lot on the menu after all. As you'd expect from the name, it begins, and ends, with burgers. Alongside a portion of triple cooked rosemary salted chips, lunch arrives served in 40's enamel trays, a nod to the austerity of the design perhaps. I was briefly tempted by the festive special, venison sausage topped, but feel I have to go for the trademark Honest Burger, served a recommended medium. The dark beef aged chuck patties, flecked with fat, are pressed onto the grill to order, tiny cloches added at the last to steam the cheese into the meat. In a space this small, the smell is mildly intoxicating and certainly enough to have me salivating before it arrives. The burger is good. Very good. A well formed cricket ball of chopped steak nearer to med-rare than medium - certainly not something I have a problem with. The glazed brioche bun gives the right amount of support, iceburg lettuce adds a welcome crunch and the tangy cheese, a cheddar in this instance, is (correctly) sparingly applied and combines well with the sweetness of the meat. The chips were a little over cooked for me, too much cooking for thin chips, it made them feel like they could have been reheated. My only other gripe was with the sliced gherkin served inside the bun, something I'm really not a fan of, but hardly enough to call for a boycott. Don't come with any hope of getting a table for more than 2, it's almost impossible to wrangle a spot for larger groups in the packed lunchtime session. Still, there are plenty of other food options in the buzzy market hall community that's gradually opening up in Brixton Market. Is it a competitor to the big boys of Byron and Meatliquor's burger king Yannis? It's difficult to say. The burger is excellent, (if not quite up there with the Meatwagon's legendary Dead Hippie) but it feels like a labour of love, very much suited for the tiny space.. They're doing well at the moment though, and if they keep their standards up, long may it continue.",

The portions are more than enough, I am a big eater and I could barely finish. The meat was sensational and the chips are the best.

HB is part of that wave of new chi-chi boutiques and restaurants that has attracted bright young things from across London and beyond. Like all victims of its success prepare to wait. At the weekend queues form before the doors officially open. Tables are admittedly small but turnaround is quick and, importantly, good-natured. I think it takes about 25 mins from sitting down to order, get fed and finish up. Not too shabby. The food itself is pure comfort and as well as being nicely presented will not remain on your plate long as looking at it is like foreplay for the tongue. Every variation of every meal is delicious. Wash down with some wine or homemade lemonade and your stomach will love you all the more.If you have to wait explore the area. There's a million things to now see and do. My advice: it's great for an established couple but not for a first date. Why? Too many good looking people milling around forcing you to turn your head. Your date will not appreciate it. You've been warned! :)",

    "text": "Very overrated on Yelp. It's a tiny restaurant, so be prepared for a wait. 50-60min wait for a table. We ended up waiting 25min just for takeout. I stood awkwardly in the cramped doorway for 10 minutes before I even got a menu. When I finally got someone's attention, I was told a 50-60min wait for a table, 10 min for takeout. Well, we ended up waiting 25min just for takeout. The burger itself tasted like cheap beef, cooked okay, but the meat was completely flavourless. The fixin's elevated the poor meat to a barely average overall burger.The fries are quite good, though. Very crispy, appropriately seasoned, and the rosemary is great.One star lost for a tasteless patty, and half a star for location, and half a star for mediocre customer service.",

    "text": "Located in Brixton Village (off Coldharbour Lane), Honest is surrounded by other one word named shops (e.g. Federation, Elephant, Relay) - most lowercase and at least one with a full stop - and, from what I could tell, only patronised by the gentrifiers of Brixton. \u00a0Nothing wrong with any of that (except the trendy lowercase, one word-full stop bullshit), just an observation.The staff is super friendly (though the two cooks did seem a bit surly to the staff) and the menu is super simple, though that shouldn't be confused with simple offerings. \u00a0Though the menu only has a hand full of items on it, all the items are perfect for the foodies among you, with their relish and rosemary and gluten-free and organic offerings. \u00a0I don't care about fancy ingredients. \u00a0I just want something good for cheap. \u00a0Here, though the clientele is super hipster douche, the staff was down to earth and normal and I didn't feel out of place at all with my medium well (rather than the default medium rare) and tap water request (which they delivered with a lemon slice).My regular beef burger was \u00a37.50 and Husband's Honest burger was \u00a39. \u00a0Husband says it's probably the best burger he's had in London. \u00a0Burgers come with rosemary chips and, though crispier than I like, Husband was very happy. \u00a0 \u00a0We sat at the bar because a table required waiting 20-30 minutes on a Sunday afternoon (around 1pm). \u00a0The nice guy taking names was very good at eyeballing tables and ejected those interlopers who would claim an empty seat without putting their name on the list first. \u00a0The list guy would call the next person on the list to alert them of the available table, allowing you to walk around the market/village and eyeball all the other tasty offerings you could be eating at instead of waiting for a table at Honest. Overall, though I'm glad we went to Honest, if I ever find myself in Brixton during mealtime again there are many other options to choose from before resorting to something I've already tried. \u00a0However, if you've never tried Honest you could do a lot worse. \u00a0Those rosemary chips, though I won't be craving them, were very nice.",

    "text": "I've been warned many times about burgers in London. Also, my burger standards have been set pretty high after being a part of the bestlaburger.com quest last year.Honest proves the London burger haters wrong though. It is a legit hamburger joint with a small menu of burgers (beef, chicken, veggie) AND real fries (not those thick soggy chips). It's located in one of those funky indoor alleys within the bustling Brixton Market and there are hungry groups of people waiting in line to be seated in the small diner style restaurant. In the beef burger category, they have the Honest Burger with bacon, cheese and the typical fix-ins, but there is also a daily special, which rotates a wide array of burger concepts. When I went, there was a Spanish style special burger with chorizo, manchego, chimmichurri, and chili peppers. The burger was about the size and shape of an orange and was oozing with goodness. The chorizo and manchego came together in a savory fusion. The heat from the chilis and the garlic-herby spike from the chimmichurri were a unique touch. All these tasty components were stacked on top of a thick high quality beef burger. It was cooked \"medium\", but the burger was still juicy on the inside. I've heard the black pudding burger is also a hit, so I'll be looking out for that special next time.Then there were the fries. REAL fries! They are included with the burger and quickly get covered in the greasy delicious burger shrapnel. It was so good to finally get fries in London that were not super thick AND were crispy... especially in those areas where some potato skin was left on. They sprinkle on some coarse salt and add a subtle rosemary flavor to create a batch of fries that should be the envy of every chicken shop in London.Lastly, Honest has some homemade lemonade which is a solid complement to the burger. This is a must-visit if you are in Brixton. Just be prepared to wait up to an hour.",

Honest is an American style burger joint with super friendly staff making a range of burgers. +1 star (a somewhat begrudging 4th) for including chips with the burger - I'm looking at you, Bukowski, charging \u00a33 for a single large potato's worth of chips). They screwed my burger up & replaced it without charge.So 5* for the service & 3* for the food - an even 2. I may have hit the food on an off day. It was good.

    "text": "I had heard Honest burger was the best burger in London, that you could rarely get a table, plus Jay Rayner said they were good, so I had to pay them a visit. The first time round there was a long waiting list, so we ended eating in 'Ettas Seafood Kitchen'. Flash-forward a few weeks and I'm back in Brixton Village and decide to give them a shot. We put our names down, and the friendly guy drop calls us with three rings to let us know our table is ready about half an hour later.The table is for two, (but we are three), has there been a mistake? no... it seems not, and we are not allowed to use the larger table which has just been cleared, as there is a larger party coming soon (apparently). So I find myself sitting uncomfortably on the corner of a tiny table while fried cooking oil slowly diffuses across the room and gradually permeates my clothes. So far not so good... Then the burger arrives, and it's tiny - Not very honest! I had ordered a cheese burger, the beef is supposed to be amazing as its aged for 35 days and comes from the Ginger Pig. But... its so-so..The burger patty is falling apart, more mince meat that anything else, as for taste, the patty was bland. I find myself adding more condiments than I should need to. \u00a0The bun/bap is brioche? Nice idea but might be better as an option..The cheese is ok, the chips - unremarkable, overly salted. i don't know what the fuss is about. I would chose Byron over Honest Burger any day...A lack of seating to accommodate diners means a waiting list is created, further hyping the burgers 'reputation'. If they had larger outlet, they probably wouldn't be do so well.",

Honest burgers is located in a place called Brixton village which was super cool and very alive at night. I love that it is outdoors yet still indoors to avoid rain. Honest burgers was delicious and holds up to its rating! I would highly recommend this place if you want a tasty burger. Call ahead to avoid the rush or just wait for a few. Also looks like people get it to go",

It's a bustling community with a friendly vibe of locals and people venturing specially here. The burgers for me are in the Top 3. I personally think some standards have decreased in their other branches but not here. The rosemary chips are the stuff of dreams. Go for the regular Honest but on 2nd visit try and get a special as those are often very good. And they often do tie ups with other food places because of this (recently did a Brindisa burger).",

The burger is simple, but with good ingredients and nothing else but exactly what you'd like. I'm addicted to the one called Homest. Cheese bacon beef and onion relish. They also got chicken breast and veggie option for those who don't want beef. Also if you want a fresh drink try the fresh mint lemonade, such a great refreshment! If you're super hungry the onion rings are really good as well!",

Most of the other burger places in London have those forzen ready fires which drives me crazy to be honest.But a good first with the rosemary salt and juicy tasty burger you cant go wrong. Another cool thing was that there was some DJ playing outside which was very entertaining and added to the experience.I'm a burger lover and i approve this message.",

Yet, it totally delivered. Fantastic tasting burgers and rosemary fries (triple cooked, I'm told, to make them extra crispy) that are out of this world.Huge accolades for having gluten-free beer and gluten-free buns available.Worth the wait. I'll be back very, very soon.",

Love the rosemary fries the most!I've had the veggie fritter which can be a hit or miss. The chicken burger is samll but delicious and the honest burger is excellent. If you come on an evening or weekend be prepared to wait for a while as there is very limited seating. We've even had take away and just sat on a bench next door bc we couldn't and wouldn't wait for over an hour. The drinks are good. Ive had lemonade and ginger beer. I love the atmosphere here and the service is quite good.",

Was busy without a queue, so we were lucky to get seats without a wait. Service was friendly & the menu, as expected, is pretty uncomplicated - beef burgers & housemade chips with rosemary (were excellent!), as an alternate to beef however, they do serve free range chicken burgers. \u00a0They also offer house made lemonade served in mason jars. Definitely does the job killing a burger craving.",

Forget IN-and-OUT (oh yes, I went there), these patties are perfect. You'll get a decent size burger with a scattering of homemade chips in a little tin bowl, HONESTly, it's adorable. The fella did say they were a little on the small size but I think they were perfect.Eat here before they become to awesome and you'll never be able to get a seat.",
