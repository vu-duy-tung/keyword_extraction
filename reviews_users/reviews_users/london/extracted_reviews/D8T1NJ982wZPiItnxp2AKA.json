    "text": "I came here with a few friends for a nice Friday night dinner after the holidays. It was the hottest new restaurants of 2014 according to Londonist, so what better way to kick off the new year? The restaurant is styled a bit like a diner, and it is quite loud inside. There is a bar area near the front then a decent amount of dining space in a rear room, but not incredibly spacious (perhaps understandable given that it is in the heart of Soho). The dishes are served in small sharing plates, so for a group of 5 we ordered a good 8-10 from all three sections of the menu. These then came in two separate courses, like you would for appetizers and mains, though they don't differ very much in size or anything. Standouts were the polenta Jerusalem style and the seared scallops. I really had my doubts about the polenta, as I generally don't enjoy it in a fine dining context, but with the truffle oil, you really can't think of anything else. And I was impressed with the portion size of the seared scallops - we ordered 2 dishes for 5 people but each plate came with 5 scallops so it was more than enough to go around. There was also a pork belly tajine that I thought was fantastic. All of us got a glass or two of wine and the bill actually came out to \u00a340 a person, which I thought was extremely reasonable for dinner in Soho with drinks.",

    "text": "One word. Polenta. You'll be encouraged to get it and if you have even the slightly love of truffle it will delight you. Though it's near impossible to get a reservation at a decent time at Palomar, I'd say it's definitely worth booking ahead a few weeks in advance. Food: I'd \u00a0recommend starting with the mezze with side of special bread. \u00a0If you do that two mains is more than enough food. I wasn't a great fan of the scallops, though the Cornfed chicken was great. The oxtail stew is also nice, though the turnips add a bit of a bitter taste, depending on what you like. The bar area also appears to be super busy - in the future I may come just to nibble on the mezze with drinks. Service: I've now been to the Palomar twice. The first time I went with a girlfriend and our waiter was absolutely delightful - he came over often to check on us, gave us lots of recommendations and compliments of the chef and he was spot on regarding every dish - if it weren't for him I never would have tried to the polenta which I just can't say enough about. \u00a0The second time I went with my partner around 11PM after a West End Show (another plus is how late this place stays open and serving!) and service wasn't as great - it seemed more of a pain for parts of the menu to be explained to us whereas the first time he came over ready for recommendations.",

It looks so very lovely, and has a great vibe - although it was rather hot and sticky on this unusually warm summer London day. Foodwise, it was nice enough but think I may have missed something here given the glowing reviews. \u00a0The food just didn't hit the spot for me. Maybe I like my Israeli food boring and traditional. \u00a0We started with the beatroot with goats cheese which was amazing. Some of the daily 6 assorted mezze dips we ordered were surprisingly a bit bland - especially the marrow dip blah. \u00a0I was expecting wonders from the polenta reviews on here but it was too cheesey for meThe malabi Rose-scented milk pudding for dessert went down a storm though.Overall I wasn't bowled over but it was a pleasant experience and I'd definitely come back to give it another go. I'd make a point to request to sit at the bar as that seems a bit more atmospheric than being crammed in at the back.As a footnote I might add considering the place is owned by the guys who ran the End (a night club were I spent much of my 20 somethings), I would have expected to hear something better than Blurred lines from the sound system!",

    "text": "I'm going to tell you a story. A story about what it's like in the restaurant called Palomar. I'm going to start off by telling you that this experience wasn't just walking off the street and hoping for a table, but it was based on a reservation that I had made two months prior. Two months. So I arrive before the four other people that I had booked for. We had a table for five. They show me to our table. In order to get to our table, I had to squeeze my way past the people eating at the bar and standing behind the bar waiting for a seat. There's a bar area that was clearly made for dining, and there's really only (barely) room for a single person to fit behind them. However, there is already an entire line of people standing behind them, so I was forced to shove my way through the crowd of people to get to the dining area in the back of the restaurant. I can only imagine what it must be like for diners eating at the bar area, as their backs must be constantly shoved by people trying to squeeze through the miniscule space to go from the door to the back of the restaurant. I get to our table. It's a round table in a corner of banquette seating with one extra chair. For five people. They probably could have put an extra chair around the table except there was another round table shoved directly up next to our table. So there was just barely room for people to squeeze through the two tables to get to the banquette seating. So now they've clearly squeezed five people around a table for four. For a reservation that I made two months prior. It's not as if I walked in and said \"Hey we can make it work\". No I booked a table at a restaurant two months prior in order to have a nice meal with some friends, and they've shoved us around a tiny table. I mean the table is tiny and really should only have four people, but possibly could have had five if there was room for two chairs, but no, only one. So when the rest of my party arrives, one of them has to physically sit with her legs across her boyfriend's lap in order for the five of us to squeeze around the table.We're looking at the menu and deciding what to order. The server seems to just answer questions to what he wants and not to what we're asking. Strange. We're trying to decide what to order. I keep asking my partner what he wants, and he responds with \"whatever\". I finally look at him and ask, \"what's wrong?\" and he responds, \"I don't want to eat here\". Our friend sitting next to him smiles, looks at him and exclaims, \"I thought I was the only one\". So we decided to get up and leave and go someplace else. Good thing the service was slow because all we had at that point was water, and we hadn't ordered drinks or anything (although it felt like it had been 10-15 minutes). So we shoved our way back through the bar area in order to leave. Apparently the toilets aren't much better as the urinals are directly underneath the sinks or something. I don't understand how a place like this could open up as the layout must be a fire hazard. I'm pretty sure I need to report them to the fire inspector, as if there was a fire in the restaurant I'm sure everyone would be trapped inside or crushed trying to get out the extremely narrow area in and out of the restaurant. Maybe the food is great, but given the severe lack of concern about their customers personal space or safety, I'm not sure how anyone could ever eat here.",

The restaurant is hugely popular and has a waiting list of about 1-2 months if you want to book in advance to dine at one of their tables at the back. My friend and I decided to chance it one weeknight and waited about an hour for a spot to dine at the bar. It's not so bad though; turn up early in the evening (or very late), hand over your mobile number and go shopping/drinking nearby. When a spot frees up ,the restaurant gives you a call so you can claim your position. The bar itself is a little packed, but it's buzzing with atmosphere. Not great for groups but the set up is perfect for catching up with a friend or for a casual date. I was most impressed with the staff's knowledge and friendliness, who was able - and willing - to go into details of every dish and even make hearty recommendations for first time visitors like myself. The dining experience is all about sharing: pick 4-6 dishes for two people and you can sample a variety of dishes. The portion sizes look small but are deceptively filling. My advice: make sure to save room for dessert; the chocolate fudge was heavenly. And give the cocktail a try!",

The spicy experience(?) was so delicious - I literally put it on everything else! The scallops, deconstructed kebab (the pita that came with was to die for!), fattoush salad, trout, baba ganoush and the polenta were outstanding and then we topped it off with the petit fours which was a great sampling - perfect to satisfy the sweet tooth without over-indulging. The service was also fantastic, our waiter -- charming young man originally from York -- was engaging and very helpful with his suggestions, all of which were spot on. It was our friend's bday (something the hostess overheard us saying when she seated us), not only did our waiter proactively wish her happy bday but they included a bday candle with the petit fours. Really sweet and unexpected touch that was greatly appreciated.",

I mean, not only are you perched up at the dining bar reveling in plate after plate of super colorful, wildly spiced and inventive dish after dish, you also get treated to spontaneous blessings by chef Tomer and his team in Hebrew during your meal! Israeli chef Tomer isn't introducing his guests to his creative twist on Israeli cooking, he's serving them an amped up, adrenaline filled dose of his homeland. At Palomar Tomer works with an artillery of spices, tinctures, and glazes to transform typical dishes into true works of irreverant art. Tomer was cooking right in front of us and basically took our order into his hands, giving us spoonfulls of things to try as we waited for the next round, explaining how he made his caramels and spice blends, and transforming some of the raw items into pregnant-friendly dishes (he poached the scallops in oil and grilled my tataki meat for me so that I could partake in the festivities --\u00a0a real mensch as we say in yiddish!). Highlights included the fish falafel, beef tataki, decontructed kebab, crab-filled kreplach in a rich broth, and the carrot cake for dessert which is made by Tomer's pastry chef wife. A truly exceptional meal in an exciting, fun, personality-charged restaurant. Reserve a spot at the back at the bar where Tomer presides so that you watch the rising star in action.",

This is far and away the best I've ever had. Instead of baked pita chips, there were more traditional croutons. The bowl had a smear of tahini / yogurt, and the flavor of the dressing was perfect. Everything about this salad was awesome.4) Polenta Jerusalem style (wife) - I tasted it, and it is one of the creamiest and most flavorful polenta's I've ever had.5) Pork Belly Tajine - round cut of pork belly - fell apart at the first touch with the fork. Very flavorful.6) Chocolate Cr\u00e9meux - if you like chocolate, get this. Awesome.7) Balevenie 14y Caribbean Cask Scotch - yummy paired with the Chocolate. If you can get a reservation, you need to get to this place ASAP!",

The waiter explained us the menu in detail and also asked for any food allergies. When I told him I couldn't eat liquorice he went and check which dish might have some. Very thorough.Then the food. We ordered kubaneh to start (a sort of fluffy brioche) because the neighbour table had it. Then our neighbour saw it on our table and order it, as did the table next to them.The kubaneh chain reaction. Cod falafels, chicken liver, pulled lamb tagliatelle, deconstructed kebabs, everything was delicious. They also have an oyster bar (although we were too full to try them) Amazing place, perfect for a date.",

Cannot make reservations other than for the noon and 5pm seating around the kitchen bar. There is a seating area beside the kitchen bar area which might be easier to score on a busy night. However, leave your name with hostess and they'll call you. While you wait to be called go have a nice glass of Rioja at the Mas Q Menos nearby in what is otherwise a touristy area.",

They recommend you alternate between both. I couldn't stop, finish the cocktail in 5 minutes. Absolutely delicious.Followed with the Kubaneh, as an appetizer. It is a greatly individually baked pita bread loaf, v tahini and velvet tomatoes, to dip. Wonderful, best tahini I've had, and the bread is fresher then fresh.I then completed with the gnocchi. Far from the Italian dish, the fried little potato bites we served over a wonderful mix of leaves, almonds and cheese. I come to London every two years or so, for business. I'll be back here, no doubt.",

    "text": "It's been awhile since we have been completed 'wowed' with great food! The first hurdle, was booking a table 3 weeks ahead. Yes that's right, we had to book 3 weeks ahead for a table! That goes to show just how popular Palomar is.The best way to describe the food at the Palomar is: tapas, modern Jerusalem style. Why? Because most of the items on the menu are little sharing plates. Based on what we ate, they all compliment each other and you'll be amazed at how many different combinations you can form with the plates you ordered.We had:Kubaneh (\u00a36.00) - this is a loaf of Yemeni bread baked in a pot and it's served with a tahini and a tomato dipThe Spicy Experience (\u00a33.50) - this is a must order for you spicy fans! As the name suggests, it's a small plate of different kinds of spices:Polenta Jerusalem Style (\u00a39.50) - hands down, the best polenta.Fattoush Salad (\u00a38.50) - a simple salad of tomato and cucumber with not so simple flavours! Seasoned with \u00a0za'atar, sumac, massive chunkcs of pita croutons and brazil nutsShakshukit (\u00a312.00) - described as a deconstructed kebab. Layered minced meat, yoghurt, tahini, \"The 4 tops\" (which we think are the drizzles of different toppings) and Yaeli's pita.Pork Belly Tajine (\u00a317.00) - A super tender pork belly (with all the lovely fatty bits intact) with Ras el Hanout, dried apricots, dried fig and Israeli couscous (giant cous cous). Fish of the day (\u00a318.00) - the fish we had that day was cod. The cod was thickly cut and cooked perfectly - crispy skin and moist flesh. Carrot Cake (\u00a37.00) - this was said to be a must try if we went to Palomar. The carrot cake itself was pretty traditional, having all the usual flavours (mixed spice, cinnamon, ginger).Jerusalem Mess (\u00a311.00) - THE MUST HAVE! If you know what an Eton Mess is, then this is the Jewish equivalent - labneh mousse, almond crumble, strawberries, lemon cream, elderflower and apple jelly & fresh sorrel. The creamy mousse had a very subtle sweetnessIt's definitely a must go if you visit London and really don't mind the price to have really awesome meal. Definitely one of best we have eaten!",

My party of two had reservations in the dining room for 9:30pm, but we were in the neighborhood early and they kindly sat us at the bar at 7:30pm. We were luckily enough to sit right in front of the head chef, which was an experience in itself. He was friendly and kept the conversation going with us all night! He gave us recommendations on what to order, and we were not disappointed! We ordered:- Chef's Nishnoush (4): A small starter which was mini. There was half a slice of pita to dip the accompanying sauces, but I would opt for the Kubaneh instead if I was to pick a bread.- Kubaneh (6): You must order this baked Yemen bread in a pot! The bread is so soft and buttery, which melts in your mouth and is perfect to accompany all the dishes! - Salmon Tartare (9): The portion was actually very meager, and nothing too out of the ordinary. If you have tried salmon tartare before then this won't be anything too novel.- Shashukit (12): A medley of minced meats with pita. It was very flavorful and one of my favorites! Must-try!- Polenta Jerusalem Style (9.5): I'm not a fan of polenta, but this was great! The added mushrooms and asparagus was a good balance to avoid making the dish too heavy! - Pork Belly Tanjine (17): This dish was large in portion! The pork belly was melt in your mouth delicious! For a party of two, this was more than enough food. We were struggling to finish the food. The portions may be small, but the small amounts of food and the bread definitely fill you up!",

It's cool to eat somewhere that has a branch in another countryI snagged a seat at the kitchen counter where I could watch the new chefs being put through their paces. My excellent waitress helped me to choose the right amount of foodI started with 2 oysters, topped with coriander, lemon and harissa oil. Zingy and he briny oyster came through wellNext was shakshukit - a deconstructed kebab with yoghurt, tahini and 4 tops. I enjoyed this but wasn't sure the deconstruction added much to the flavour profileI was surprised to see pork belly on the menu - my waitress confirmed the restaurant wasn't fully kosher! The pork belly came with tagine, ras El hanout and dried apricot and Israeli couscous. Unfortunately, the belly was a little dryI finished off with Malabi, a rose-scented milk pudding that the chef topped off with a birthday candleThere are so many more interesting sounding dishes on the menu that I want to go back and try",

The Pork was cooked well and as a Tagine style dish, it is all about slow cooking. The glazed carrot and dry fruit were welcome friends to the pork and prevented the dish from becoming too samey. The final Sweets, the Jerusalem Mess was a great surprise. The moose, the crumble and the sorrel were all so good. The crunch, the cold, the freshness and the sweetness most importantly made me absolutely stuffed.",

My husband and I often joke that we'd come back to London just to have their food all over again. So do yourself a favor and stop in if you're in the area, because I'm jealous you can and I can't.",

I thought they were going to have to bring a gurney to get me out of there. We were not disappointed by a long shot.

Service was fairly attentive and food was very good. \u00a0Everything is shared and brought as it is ready. \u00a0We tried a selection of dips,Tzatziki, Taramasalata and Baba Ganoush. All were very good. Also did glazed chicken livers and duck confit, as well as beets and \"Tree of Life\" broccoli. \u00a0I didn't think the livers or duck were standouts but they were tasty enough. Cocktails were good. \u00a0My expectations were maybe for something a little less chaotic so that probably colored my impression. \u00a0I will say, and not to sound like a grumpy old man, but this was one of the loudest, most cramped restaurants I have been to in a while, in one of the busiest neighborhoods in London (at least on a Saturday night). \u00a0I was hoping for something more like Zahav in Philadelphia, but this was definitely more casual and, for me, a little too much sensory overload from the noise, crowds and loud music. \u00a0That's not the restaurant's fault, so just putting this out there so anyone reading knows what to expect.",

This is definitely one of those restaurants where everything on the menu is very well-prepared, so it's hard to go wrong with any one particular dish.We ordered: - Kubaneh: Yemeni pot baked bread served with tahini & velvet tomatoes. Great starter dish but make sure to share with at least one other person or else you'll be too full.- Fattoush Salad: tomato, cucumber, za'atar, sumac, challag croutons, Brazil nuts and labneh. Refreshing and balanced some of the richer dishes.- Shakshukit: deconstructed kebab with minced beef & lamb, yoghurt, tahini, cured lemon & harissa. Interesting concept and solid flavors, but didn't blow us away like the other dishes.- Polenta Jerusalem Style with asparagus, mushroom ragout, parmesan & truffle oil. Super rich and savory - would definitely order again.- Gnocchi Hamousta: fennel & leek cream, almonds & ricotta salata. Unique dish that was well-prepared.- Jerusalem Mess: Labneh mousse, almond crumble, strawberries, lemon cream & fresh sorrel. The perfect end to a wonderful meal!Overall, each dish was amazing, but the combination of everything was a little too rich for us and we ended up a bit too full. If we went back, I would probably substitute the gnocchi or the shakshukit with a lighter dish. Make sure to make reservations for this restaurant. I made reservations 3 weeks prior and a lot of the times were already booked.",

We dined up to closing time and one of the severs was having her own drink after her shift. I asked what she got and after telling me about it, she went and got a cup to give me a taste.

    "text": "One of my top 3 restaurants in London - I've eaten at the sister restaurant, Barbary, about 5 times now and I can't get enough of it and I've now eaten here 3 times, it's one of my favorites. My only regret about Palomar is not coming here sooner.It's hard to get a reservation here, but they do have walk-in seating at the bar, so if you come early enough when they open you may not have to wait, or if you come during dinner-time, expect a 1-2 hour wait. I wouldn't come past 8 pm since they probably will be done taking names for the dinner service.The menu changes quite frequently depending on the season and what is fresh, but the following always seems to be on the menu - I've gone multiple times over the course of a year and these things seem to be staples.Kubaneh Bread, tomato, tahini (\u00a36.40) - This is a bit expensive for bread, but it comes out fresh from the oven and is light, fluffy and remissent of brioche. It comes with a tomato sauce and a tahini sauce, both of which are delicious paired with the bread. I almost always get this when I bring someone new to the restaurant for their first time.Burnt Courgette Tzatziki Mint, garlic, sumac (\u00a34.30) - This dip goes really well with the bread, so if you get the bread, get this as well! It almost tastes a little fizzy / effervescent and it's one of my favorite dips.Octo Hummus Chickpea msabacha, aubergine (\u00a313.80) - This octopus is really delicious, it's grilled and served with a chickpea mash. I almost always get this as well.Shakshukit Beef, lamb, pistachios, pine nuts (\u00a312.50) - This is like a deconstructed kebab. It was good, but I preferred the other dishes more. I got it on the first time I went here but haven't gotten it on subsequent visits.Fattoush Salad Tomatoes, cucumber, sumac (\u00a39.80) - This salad is fresh and tasty with amazing croutons, and very flavorful from the sumac. This is worth getting; if you're only 2 people you can get a half portion so you can get other things.Polenta Mushrooms, asparagus, truffle (\u00a39.80) - This is good but pretty rich and very heavy on the truffle. It's good for a few bites but it was almost a little too heavy for me. Ricotta gnocchi in a fennel cream sauce - They always have a rotating pasta dish on the menu (or 2) and this ricotta gnocchi was delicious and one of my favorite dishes I've had here. The gnocchi was deep fried I think and placed on top of a cream sauce. It was fluffy and crispy all at the same time. If they happen to have something like this on the menu, you should get it.I've had 3 desserts total at Palomar - two of them were winners and one was just so-so. My favorite one was the Jerusalem Mess: labneh mousse, almond crumble, strawberries and sorrel. It was the perfect combo of tart and sweet. I normally like chocolate desserts over non-chocolate ones but this one hit it out of the park. I also got the Reverse Chocolate Fondue which had a crumble, banana financier, vanilla marshmallow and peanut tuile. It was also really good but I liked the Jerusalem Mess more. They usually have 4 desserts on the menu that change seasonally. To be honest, the desserts here are not the highlight of the meal, but the savory dishes are so good that I will overlook that.Overall, this is one of my favorite restaurants in London and favorites in the world -- so don't miss the chance to eat here if you can. Try to make a reservation ahead of time (either for the first seating at the bar, or for the restaurant section of the restaurant), or go early to put your name down and wait for a seat at the bar.",

    "text": "Trendy, loud, and smelly bo\u00eete in Soho. It has a raw bar, a very lively counter space, offers cocktails (I had my shoshonna, quiet tasty), and an eclectic middle eastern inspired menu. Quiet popular, but we were able to get in the day of rez. The hostess took our name down upon arrival, then called us on our cell once a table was available. My sister refused to sit at the counter because of the intense allium and spice as well as fried food odors, so we retreated into the very cozy dining room. Our server, a delightful young woman, was attentive as a millennial can be. I forgive her few mistakes, such as forgetting to bring a dish or two, because she was so much fun. As for the food...Certainly, not the best food I've had in London. We tried quiet a few dishes, sharing them all. What I liked the best was also the least expensive item, the spicy experience, pickled small green chili with harissa. The tree of life, a head of broccoli charred and topped with pine nuts, served over a bed of yogurt, sounded promising, but was very very bland and undercooked. The chicken served on a cast iron hot plate suffered from the same. And the hummus? Well, I'm not one who will be rhapsodizing over the ubiquitous and overrated dip. I think there's too much hummus in the world. Burnt courgette tzatziki was too soupy, the truffle polenta serviceable. Would I go back there? Yes, if it were easy to get in after seeing a play and have a couple of mezes and a drink at the most. What it IS NOT IS THE MOST FABULOUS \u00a0FOOD in London, or elsewhere. Perhaps diners who think so, reach that conclusion not to look too foolish after waiting a a long while to be seated, and paying up a nice sum. Who knows?",

    "text": "Really great food, nice ambiance. Tables are quite close together and maneuvering in & out of seats/booths could be challenging for some. The serving sizes are tapas portions and we ordered about 8 items between 3 of us. The kubaneh, fattoush salad, and seared scallops were our favorites. The polenta was okay but nothing to write home about. Our least favorite was the fish tagine.",

While we enjoyed our meal, besides the sea bass the other dishes didn't stand out as items I would have to order if I went back.",

    "text": "Put my name down for two at 6:30pm and was seated at 7:10pm (they estimated 8pm). I waited outside but they took my number down in case I wanted to walk around.One selection from each type of food was a great amount for two people. The kubaneh and tzatziki were amazing. I didn't expect \"bread and yogurt dip\" to be so memorable: The bread was like a giant cinnamon roll (as in fluffy and spiraled) and the tzatziki was unlike anything I've had before. Kind of tasted mustardy and had more character than other variations I've tried previously (which I enjoy but all blend together in my memory). My cousin and I were still eating it once the bread was gone. The beetroot carpaccio was underwhelming and we could have done without it. For the main course, we had the risotto special and polenta. Both were savory, rich, and delicious. Apps were definitely the star.The vibe of the restaurant was unique. It was cool sitting at the bar watching the kitchen and being served by the chefs. It was loud, but not hard to have a intelligible conversation. One weird thing was the dip/raw chef would taste the food and keep using the same spoon to mix the dish (and dishes after). Maybe it's just me, but I think he should have been using clean spoons.Overall really great experience. I'd recommend it, and I'd go back!",

    "text": "My friend chose the Palomar for one of her last meals in London before she went back to Australia (sob.) I did really like the food, but I wouldn't rush back.We'd heard that you could easily grab a table by the bar without booking, so I arrived early to put our name down. The lady at the front said someone had just cancelled, so they had a free table a bit later. This was all good, but she made me give my credit card details, and told me she'd charge \u00a380 (\u00a320 per head if we didn't show up.) That all seemed strange to me. She was basically telling me she'd just charged some poor soul \u00a380 for not showing up, and that she'd have the same from us if we didn't show up too...even though this was only 1.5 hours notice. So...they seem really greedy - I basically decided I don't like the way they treat people before we even got to sit down!!Later when we made it into the restaurant I was happier. It has a nice relaxing atmosphere and our waiter was really friendly. Things I loved:- I probably shouldn't start with it, but the sorbet is amaaaazing. Seriously, this might be one of the nicest possible ways to finish a good meal.- I loooved the Tzatziki - it's just a dip, but their version was gorgeous. - I really liked the beetroot carpaccio.- The beets go prawns were nice too.Less impressive:- After telling us we'd under-ordered and we should get another item we were encouraged to try the truffle polenta...BUT in they didn't bother bringing it. In the end they brought it out after we'd finished everything else, but the flavours were just a bit too strong to eat it alone. Meh. I wasn't keen at all.- Octo-humus was also a bit of a disappointment. I love octopus when it is good, but this just wasn't fresh enough. Ah well. - We were really squished in!! We had 3 people on a table for four, but it was pretty cramped. - There was also a chilly draft, even right at the back of the restaurant.",
