It has a lovely, eclectic, slightly quirky interior, great service and a really superb breakfast menu (everything from fruit or pastries to a full cooked English). However, I find the dinner menu quite pretentious and a too pricey. Good food, admittedly, but it certainly won't make my list for favourites. It doesn't feel much like a pub to me. Most Gastropubs at least feel like a pub underneath the fancy food. If you want a good pub, go to the Woolpack opposite, but stay here for a great breakfast or a more special meal.",

And the downstairs cinema room is lovely, and you can hire it for private parties for a song! We even considered starting a movie club just so we could all go there once a month and lounge around enjoying their food and drink and watching a DVD. Check it out if you can.",

During the evening the candles are lit and the atmosphere is even more inviting, it is however, incredibly popular making it difficult if not impossible to find a seat for a drink or two. For this reason I prefer The Garrison during the day when you can relax and fully appreciate the beautiful atmosphere without the crowds and the noise of a full pub.",

The wait allowed me to take in the eclectic decor which I found fun and down to earth. Watch out for the small tea lights sitting on the edge of the bistro tables. If one is bumped and falls off that ledge you'll have wax all over you. Unfortunately, I lost a nice polo to this type of accident upon my visit. Aside from my new coat of wax our dinner was really good and I'll certainly be dining here again. I started with the Gazpacho and the Smoked Haddock for my main, both items I can recommend. Our server was fantastic and even entertaining. Head to the Garrison if you're looking for a relaxing and enjoyable meal with a lively setting. This American Southerner left satisfied with a feeling of hometown hospitality and that's truly a good thing y'all.",

The wines are spot on and go well with the food. \u00a0The pork belly is not to be missed and seems to be a regular on the menu- melt in your mouth. \u00a0On this last visit we ordered the rabbit terrine, and the chestnut parcel and both were delicious.  \u00a0The rabbit terrine was more rustic in style and laced with apricots, served with a delicious ale chutney that had a nice balance of acidity and sweetness to cut the fattiness of the terrine. \u00a0The chestnut parcel was roasted chestnut with caramelized leeks wrapped in a flaky fillo-esque pastry, served with a red pepper coulis. \u00a0Totally decadently wonderful.The Garrison in short is charming, authentic, and a wonderful culinary experience.

So when she clears her plate and declares her meal absolutely delicious, you know they've hit on something. The menu makes the simple things too impressive and the impressive dishes look simple. My mother's lamb with green beens was \"cooked to perfection\", my girlfriend's sea bass was polished off to happy noises and my duck breast with creamy leeks was tender and juicy. The wine list is very decent and praline ice cream to finish was deliciously creamy. This is no one off - last time at The Garrison the food was also delicious. It's very cosy and easy to while away the time with a glass or two, plus there's Adnan's for those who like their ale. Dates, long-term partners and parents will all be impressed with this place.

The cornish crab and seared tuna are particularily good, although one of my favourite meals here was a simple fish finger sandwhich from the bar menu.What sets this place out from standard pubs is the private room and cinema in the basement which can be hired out for private parties. The cinema especially is a great idea if you have a birthday party and want a more inspired evening then just sitting around drinking (not that that isn't fun either). They can also provide food for you when you are down there, so you can really make an evening of it.",

It's got a bit of a wow-factor when you walk in, really interesting bits and pieces on the walls etc. We were on a working lunch, so rather sadly, I didn't sample the ales, but my grey mullet was out of this world - literally one of the nicest lunches I've had in ages. We sat on a long tall 'bar' table arrangement, which was actually surprisingly comfy. There's an old cinema downstairs, which they rent out during the day - also a great space. Keep it up!",

Fantastic decor, lovely chairs and tables all different designs, light wooden floor and walls, big lampshades, and overall just a lovely cosy atmosphere. It almost feels like a cross between someone's living room and a restaurant. The day we were here it was a beautiful sunny day so the light outside really complimented the colours inside adding to the cool vibe. The lunch we had here was great, lovely menu with lots of choice, and I'd love to come back to sample the Sunday lunch. It's a great place to hang out on a Sunday afternoon reading the paper and I'll definitely be coming back. The cinema room downstairs is perfect to hire if you need a room to spend a day for any reason, great for companies to use who want something different.",

    "text": "The Garrison may well be a victim of its own success. It was absolutely full to capacity on a Monday night because it does have great food. I had the kedgeree which was very very slightly too liquidy with just a smidgin too much curry, but overall quite delicious. I also had the gingerbread with ginger ice cream that was perfectly nice.So why the gripe? Well it has tried to pack rather a lot of tables and chairs in, and it has gone from eclectic to claustrophobic. It was quite difficult to get the attention of anyone in order to get more tap water, but they were surprisingly persistent with the dessert menus. I also dislike the time limit on their tables - especially as we were dining with our friend who has supported them for years and years. It feels like it's become a place that simply tries to turn over as many customers as physically possible in a night. I do realise that's how money is made in the restaurant biz, but most places tend to be a little more subtle about it. So, I'm not sure I'm going back, and my friend who was been patronising them for years is also a little iffy on the whole idea.",

I'll give it five stars for food, and four stars for being way too busy on a Sunday night so we had to sit at the bar. \u00a0We ordered a few glasses of wine and the special cider they were making, of course delicious. Appetizer started with the tomato and pepper soup as well as the warm goat cheese salad. Both delicious and super fresh tasting. Main--Roast pheasant with pancetta. I've never had pheasant \u00a0before, but i adored this dish. it was succulent, with a good salty hearty flavor of the pancetta. \u00a0The bar servers were super sweet as they felt bad for us eating in a crowded area but all in all, I would be happy to come back. \u00a0This goes WAY beyond my expectations for a gastropub (read my last review on a gastropub :)), I was almost tempted to keep this info to myself but its too good not to check out! PS Sundays, they have movie nights....last week it was Shame and this week its Dark Knight!",

The vibe and atmosphere was unique and modern, the service extremely friendly and helpful, and you could really sense their dedication to unique and rustic food choices. If you want to get a good idea of the vibe of the place, their website is awesome and very representative of the pub itself.Not just the best food I've had at a pub, one of the best meals I've had anywhere!

I ended up having a light lunch and just got one their smaller dishes, which was a chicken sandwich. It came out and I was shocked how big it was. The chicken in it was large thick chicken breast pieces which still had the skin left on from the roast. The bread was lovely and had a light chilli cheese dressing which brought a different edge to the sandwich. The chips were fresh and piping hot, thin, crispy with their skins still on. Food was spot on and staff were lovely. One small comment and this may sound unusual but the fragrance of the pub was very off putting. They had obviously sprayed something or had some sort of diffuser which was quite overpowering and unpleasant. After 15 minutes being sat in there, I started to get a bit of a headache.

The place was packed though it still wasn't dinnertime and my companions and I were given a time slot for dinner since we didn't have a reservation.A first look at the menu indicated that The Garrison isn't cheap but a second look inside convinced me to give this upscale pub a try. I was really impressed by the mix of pub, restaurant and living room atmosphere that in total looked like a sophisticated old school dollhouse. Since The Garrison is Michelin recommended I was even more curious about the food. Next to the menu it offers daily changing dishes.Our little group tried the fish, chicken, and tartar (everything around \u00a312-18) and I personally have to say that it was tasteful but didn't put my socks off like the pizza at Pizza East or the burger at The Dean Swift. Maybe my expectations were too high or the pints were adulterating my taste.Overall I liked the atmosphere and interior, the food as well, though I expected more, and would return next time I am in London.",

I'm the kind of person who actually quite enjoys dining at a bar, since this usually means you get great service.Operative word: usually.Throughout my visit, the bar staff was aloof and lacking proper restaurant/bartending knowledge. Someone beside me ordered a flat white, and a black americano arrived with milk. I am not joking. My companion and I were left alone for lengthy periods of time. The honey macademia nuts I ordered never arrived despite appearing on the bill. And we only received the bill and paid for our lunch after flagging the bar staff down to ask for it and looking at anyone and everyone with longing desperation of a chip and PIN machine.The food - while quite tasty and innovative - came in woefully small portions, at woefully high price points.The complimentary thick-sliced brown bread accompanied by soft butter?

    "text": "Delightful and delectable smells wafting from their windows & a good looking local neighbourhood gastropub...BUT...I've been to the Garrison before, a long time before! Its good to know that the interior hasn't changed much (sometimes too much change is a bad thing) cos its pretty perfect the way it is. Think of Kath Kidston meets the Stepford wives' country manor clubhouse. Its cutesy, country manor style decor, with one-off pieces here and there. I especially love the downstairs area for its warm table layout, with comfy mocha brown sofa lounges, original overhead screen projection-cum-cinema concept (screenings every Sunday evening) and a feature wall of illuminated glass bottles of various shapes and sizes.We were there on a lazy Sunday afternoon, nursing a not-quite-a-hangover from the previous nights' celebrations (my bday drinks) but certainly in need of good coffee and fine grub. With the former - it was a great macchiato, beautifully presented with the rich dark layer of espresso at the bottom, the middle layer being a warm hot chocolate looking melding of the espresso and hint of frothed milk, topped with a small dollop of foamy milk. Unfortunately, I can't pay too many compliments to the meal. Whilst the roast loin of pork that I ordered from the Sunday roast menu was reasonably apportioned for one, my friends' orders came out looking more of an entree sized dish for a mains price tag. Nonetheless, the food itself was absolutely delicious, my only gripe is that the pork was perhaps a little too overcooked in the middle (therefore rendering it slightly dry) and they could've been a little more generous with the side dishes (I recounted 2 pieces of everything, including 2 very lonely looking broccoli). Their roast potatoes were faultless however - crunchy thick coating but fluffy and powdery inside! Opinions about dessert was somewhat divided amongst the table - I thought the crumble on our pear and blackberry crumble with salted caramel ice cream, was a little too hard and too buttery that it risked overcoming the subtle flavours of the pear and blackberry filling. The ice cream was fantastic however. Portion size wise, we shared one dessert between 3 and there was more than enough to go round the table. Overall, I think the Garrison is a good spot to take your date out and impress him/her with both the daily specials menu, the relatively modest wine and cocktail list and ofcourse, the dessert to share! Just be prepared to part with some well earned squids!",

It often is not-so-secret-code for \"old, small, smelly and run down.\"Question: can a restaurant pull off shabby chic in an elegant mouth watering manner rather than filling your mental chops with visions of cobwebs and moth balls?Answer: Yes. If you're at the Garrison. Sister (or perhaps granny) to Village East, the acclaimed restaurant just down the road, this gastropub serves up innovative, fresh, and local food combos like it's going out of style... but leave that award to their decor, instead. Everything is so well thought out from the small bar where internet types square up with their macs aglow, to the small chalkboard menu boasting daily specials. Truly, I could not have been happier or more comfortable with the airy ambiance -- it's the type of place that you'll want to bring every visitor that comes to London. It's a reason to be thankful you live here. And then there was the food... oh the fooooood. Each dish was absolutely incredible, from the risotto to the gnocchi to the cod special. Unfortunately, we were in the embarrassing conundrum of being in such a hurry that we weren't able to truly experience any of it. We sat, we scarfed, we paid, we ran. It was about 30 minutes door to door. But not to worry, I will certainly be back. Immediately, if not sooner. The Garrison is worth going out of the way for.",

My dining buddies also let out the occasional groan of satisfaction as they devoured their gnoochi and cod main meals. \u00a0The Garrison is not cheap, rolling in at around \u00a314 on average for a main course. Yet as you walk in, you can't help but admire the opulent, decadence of the place. Backed up by a stunning gastro pub British food menu and a private cinema room, this place is a winner. The staff know they do good food and have a sexy establishment. I couldn't help but feel the service from our waitress was a little snooty, but with food this good topped of with the lovely house Chardonnay I destroyed, I will end this review in the positive way it deserves.Mmmmm... \u00a0Ohhhhhh yeahhhhhhhhh!",

Strangely, this pub seems to be more focused on wine than on beer. The desserts looks tasty, but I opted for the cheese board. For \u00a37, they brought out a board with 3 full wedges of cheese. I asked if I was expected to finish it all myself. The answer was \"yeah, why not?\".",

As a main, I had the rabbit on pearl barley. \u00a0The rabbit fell off the bone but it wasn't memorable otherwise. \u00a0My partner had a lovely goats cheese salad and he liked his risotto but it came with old rocket which didn't look very nice on the plate. \u00a0I felt like I could have made everything at home.The presentation also needed quite a bit of work. \u00a0I don't need over the top, stacked food or anything but quite a few of dishes were monotone in colour. \u00a0Brown lentils, brown fried fish with orange slices. \u00a0Orange rabbit leg on orange pearl barley. \u00a0I had a nice time with friends but definitely won't be going back for the food.",

The other Yelpers are spot on that The Garrison excels at being rustic shabby chic without being either too shabby nor too pretentious. All in it's a great place for a meal.To start I ordered the gazpacho which was a refreshing treat on a surprisingly sunny London day. They were a a bit stingy with the avocado pieces but otherwise it was a good start to the meal. \u00a0Being a Sunday, I of course went with the roast beef...served medium rare with a selection of veggies, potatoes and pan drip gravy, and of course a Yorkshire pudding. Be sure to ask for a side of horseradish. There is also a nice selection of ciders and some hard to find beers.All in 4 stars. Just be sure to book well in advance, prime roast hours get booked quickly.",

Now I'm still new to London and learning and exploring the city, but I was greatly impressed with this gastropub. I was really hoping to get a late breakfast, but sadly that ends at 11:30am. I opted in for the tuna steak, a bloody mary, and a cappucino for take away. Everything hit the spot even the bread with butter! Everything was just super tasty that I took the bread and soaked up the sauces from the tuna steak dish. If there was any complaint it would be that it was definitely a pretty expensive lunch. It's a shame they don't open earlier in the morning Mon-Fri, otherwise I'd hop in for a coffee during my morning walk to work.",

Some dishes are really outstanding while others are good but not brilliant, so it's a bit of pot luck (although, for example, you will probably be ok with something like delicious figs stuffed with delicious cheese).The decor and atmosphere, as others have said, is really cosy yet buzzing. The downstairs area is particularly cute and calmer, if it happens to be open when you're there. The staff are very friendly but can be quite inattentive - you have to flag them down, remind them about orders etc. Having said that, both times I've been I was let in without a reservation so they were probably quite stretched. I would be prepared to come here a lot if I could afford it. I can't, sadly, but there is certainly no shortage of others enjoying this place.",

The Garrison & Bermondsey Street, up to recently was a mystery to me and I only really came out here to intrude on my friend's brunch with her boyfriend (which I had not met before), even though I protested as I didn't want to feel like a third wheel. Oh how glad I did....From the moment I stepped in - I knew this was my kind of place. I am a sucker for amazing quirky decorated places and 'The Garrison' didn't disappoint with it's mix match plates, cosy tea sets and eccentric trinkets. The people was lovely but service was a little slow though I wasn't too worried about that as it was Sunday Brunch so the place was packed. If you haven't made a booking you might have to wait a bit.We ordered some tea and OJ for drinks then me and my friend ordered Eggs Benedict and her boyfriend got a full English breakfast. It arrived with no delay and looked amazing drenched in just the right amount of yellowy Hollandaise sauce. It was so good and fulling that I don't think I was hungry till well in the afternoon.I can't wait to head back to try out the lunch and dinner menu if breakfast was so good. BTW, we dined on the table next to Professor Green, apparently it's a favourite haunt of his as well. Amazing breakfast and celebrity spotting - what more can you ask of a Sunday morning.",

    "text": "Great decor and atmosphere, very friendly staff, a bit pricey given the relatively small portionsI was on the search for a new brunch place today with a couple of friends. Walking down Bermondsey, we noticed the Garrison and the smells emanating from the kitchen were enough to draw us in immediately. We ran into a slight hurdle as we hadn't made a reservation and the place was packed (this is about 1pm on a Sunday). Luckily, the opened up the cinema room downstairs and seated us right away. The girls grabbed the really comfy looking couch type seats and I settled into the hard wooden chairs (damn the price of chivalry!).Our waitress was cute and friendly and was eager to provide suggestions when asked despite having just started the day before. We opted for a mix of dishes to share: 1) smoked pigeon with black pudding on a bed of rocket, 2) shredded pork and salmon (the mix had the consistency of light tuna salad) with melba toast and a mustarda (not really sure what this was made of), and 3) a pork sunday roast with all the trimmings.The smoked pigeon was tasty with a rich salty flavour and the meat was tender as duck should be. Sadly, the portion was barely more than a breast, so it was perhaps an appetiser but not \u00a0proper meal. The shredded pork and salmon likewise was full of flavour but lacking in size. The pork roast was seared and juicy but more than half of the serving was fat which was a bit disappointing. The potatoes deserve special mention as they were delicious with crispy chewy skin containing light fluffy flesh. The potatoes were also tossed with herbs giving a little extra flavour. The pear and blackberry crumble and salty caramel ice cream was a satisfying end to the meal. The cumble was a little too chewy but the pear and blackberry filling was sweet and tart in all the right places. The ice cream (recommended by our waitress) was the perfect complement with the saltiness enhancing the sweetness of the crumble.Overall, loved the taste of the food and just wished the portions were a bit bigger. It's a good place to have a chat and catch up with friends over a quick bite, but won't satisfy that hungover brunch craving.",

A roast on offer for all tastes, we were able to grab a cosy table at the back and place our order.Have to say I was more than happy with my Roast Beef, nice simple selection of vegetables, crunchy roast potatoes and a creamy Yorkshire pudding - the beef was cooked perfectly and the serving was more than adequate! My companions were a little sad to note that the Yorkshire only comes with the roast beef as standard, so if this is what makes a Sunday British roast for you I'd suggest letting your waitress know :)Service was amazing, the hostess and our waitress were super lovely and I can't fault them for accommodating us, unbooked, on a busy Sunday. Looking forward to venturing back to see what else the menu has to offer!",

The place is a cozy/hipster gastropub that serves quite a few interesting dishes as well as a well a good Sunday roast menu.We ordered the chicken and vegetarian dishes out of the Sunday roast menu and split the chocolate brownie for dessert. All the dishes were really tasty and filling so that was great. The only downside was the service, our server just kept taking our plates once she assumed we were done, without really asking if we are done or not. Because of that, I had to sadly say goodbye to a few last bites on my main dish and brownie (which I actually should be thankful for). Reservation is a must.",

The menu offers both French and Italian dishes, as well as a scrumptious Fish and Chips platter for more traditional fare. The suggested wine pairings were fantastic, as well. This was by far one of the most enjoyable meals we had in London. We also went out of our way to visit their sister pub, Walkers of Whitehall, which served up some delightful cocktails near Trafalgar Square (their pub menu was delicious, as well). I would definitely return.",

The menu followed the theme of keeping it simple, only 7-8 main options and all sounding great. I went with the pan fried trout. It was perfectly executed with beautiful crispy skin. On the drinks menu they didn't have tomato juice, but they made it happen which was great.At the end of the meal I tested out their new payment option (PandaPay) where you can pay for your meal from your mobile. I just had to ask the waiter for the table number, download the PandaPay App and then all was very simple and quick from there.What sums up the Garrison for me is \"simpleness\" from ordering to food to payment. Simpleness is great when it is done right! :)",

It was crowded with a business crew but we were still seated (which was next to a bathroom area that produced a pungent odor).When we sat, we were given menus and ordered coffee- at that point everything was off to a great start. When we placed our order, there were a few things we ordered that were no longer available (it was 8:35 AM), settling for second options, between the table we ordered two Egg & Bacon sandwiches, English breakfast and Eggs Benedict. Seeing majority of the restaurant had been served, we assumed it would be relatively normal service. Then we didn't see our waiter or food for a solid 35-40 minutes but we kept seeing staff go downstairs, grab one ingredient and then head to the kitchen (we realized these were our breakfast ingredients). During this time, we felt as though our waiter was purposefully avoiding eye contact- we had to ask for water twice and then once the food arrived it was good but nothing special and we waited for someone to come back around to ask for the check. All in all, I was pretty bummed out by this place. It had such good reviews that we thought it was going to be a great sendoff breakfast.",

The place is nice, and I especially like the street where it sits in. There are many locations around looking all very appealing. Staff was nice, very careful with our table. Place was busy with people both drinking and eating. We had the asparagus lyonnaise and the burrata to start and then the gnocchi beetroot, the chicken and the haggott. All were nice, well cooked, good in size, and got us happy and all. We had a Malbec wine with it. We finished with the delicious brownie, and cheese board. All dishes were good, brought up in due time, tasty and all though my memory of a classic night with no shooting star to remember about BuT I recommend this place as it sits as a good gastropub in a cool area. You can walk there coming from the shard. And the hip Maltby market is not far either for an after/before meal walk trip.",
