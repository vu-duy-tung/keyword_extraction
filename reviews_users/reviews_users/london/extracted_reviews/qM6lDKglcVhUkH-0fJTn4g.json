Older sis got the Calamari in spicy sauce, the portion was small, the flavor anything but small! Younger sis got the Merguez sausages which were phenomenal!

My friends and I had a really nice time here.So why the lost stars? Well, for one thing, there was a plague of flies buzzing around us the whole time. I for one had showered earlier in the day, so after a couple of sly whiffs of my being, I ascertained that it wasn't us that brought the flies in. We asked the waitress and she said that there had been an infestation that they were dealing with.Now, I don't know the rules on restaurant hygiene, but in my humble opinion, if a restaurant has an infestation of flies to the point where it's actually pestering customers, it should not be open. It was disgusting having all these little critters buzzing around our food and drink for the entirety of the meal.Also, I wasn't too keen on our waitress. She was nice enough, but she seemed to adopt the mannerisms of the flies; she kept buzzing over every couple of minutes to look at our plates to see if \u00a0she could take them. I actually got really annoyed when she did this when 1 of the 3 of us was clearly still eating, even though the other two had finished. I don't know if she was in a rush to get us out or something, but being constantly interrupted by her was pretty irritating.",

It certainly had a real charm and the food was delicious. The restaurant is spread over two floors, we sat downstairs where it was cosy and a bit higaldypicaldy with mismatch wooden chairs and tables. You might need to be careful on the stairs on the way out especially if you enjoy the excellent French wines available here.  You will find yourself sitting pretty close to your neighbouring diners but it's still quite intimate and very romantic if you are eating as a couple. During our meal a young singer performed, it was very atmospheric and added to the evening. The staff were young and French, and respected our attempts to pick traditional french dishes and regional wines. The food was honest traditional and delicious, we were too full to eat desert but finished with nice coffee. It's very easy to spend the whole evening here",

Luckily there are only 4 tables in the hall and they are all for parties of 2. Best bet, bring 2 friends. \u00a0The wine list is small along with the menu. A prix fixe holiday 3 course was available but I stuck with the roots of this intriguing dungeon.I chose the only Pinot Noir and started with the French onion soup. When in Rome... Nothing extraordinary but not bad.The Sea bass was on the dry side so I added a pat of butter from the loaf basked passed on to add a bit of fun. It worked. The fish was server over creamed peas. How far can you take world peace/whirled peas?When offered dessert, I asked for a suggestion and \"I would defiantly go with the lemon tart\" flowed without hesitation. So be it. I must admit, I'm no fan of lemon flavored deserts but if this is what she wants me to eat. I'll oblige. The tart came out fast and was beautiful.If you paid attention, the theme here is limited. Limited spaceLimited wineLimited menuLimited flavourBut most of all...and most important here friends, limited price!The price combined with quick, friendly service of good, but not great food, gives Le Garrick a higher mark on my list from a 3 to a 4.Pop in before a show or just because you want a square meal for a good price. Le Garrick delivers. Young and fun all around.",

    "text": "While waiting for B and the lovely Ms Mapp to arrive at Le Garrick for dinner on Wednesday evening it dawned on me that I had been frequenting this French bistro for over 10 years. While not my favourite restaurant in town by any means it has a real charm and can be relied on to serve up classic French comfort food time after time. As Winter begins to draw in it's a great place for a mid-week supper and a good gossip with friends. Like football it's a game of two halves and the restaurant is spread over two floors; upstairs there are four or five tables with a good view through the large windows of the evening crowds heading up to Covent Garden or Leicester Square. It's a good spot to watch the world go by but my personal choice is the windowless basement with its labyrinth of small rooms furnished with an eclectic selection of wooden tables and chairs. You will find yourself sitting pretty close to. your neighbouring diners but it's still quite intimate and very romantic if you are eating as a couple. Its a popular choice with tourists, locals and those seeking a discreet venue for an illicit liaison so I would advise booking in advance.  There is also small bar downstairs which seats four at a squeeze if all the tables are taken. This Wednesday evening we had the pleasure of being entertained by a young \"Sinatra\" and accompanying pianist at the far end of the room. All very atmospheric and at just the right volume. Staff are mainly youngish French girls who bustle about with skill and dexterity - smile and treat them well and they will return the favour in spades!!  So once the ladies had finally arrived it was down to business with a bottle of the fine and a reasonably priced house white from a short but well edited list of French wine.  We kicked off by sharing the cheese fondue, camembert baked in its box with the addition of some wine and garlic. It's always good and although it's listed as a dish for two it will easily feed three. Some bread and little merguez sausages with onions on the side made this a very tasty start to our supper. After having had the fillet steak the weekend before at Gaucho I thought I would give the Onglet steak here, at a third of the price, a run out. The ladies agreed with me so it was three medium rare steaks with frites and b\u00e9arnaise sauce on the side. Known as the \"butchers\" steak this comes really well tenderised, cooked to perfection and is full of robust meaty flavour. It's not going to win any awards for culinary innovation but it's good, honest food and pretty damm tasty. It's very easy to find the evening has slipped through your fingers at Le Garrick and before I knew it there was barely time for a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, from the small selection of dessert classics, followed by an espresso and a dash to Charing Cross station to get the last train back to Nunhead. For regular London diners it's worth noting that you can make this a very cheap mid-week treat if you have invested in a \"Taste London\" card, which can be had for an annual fee of around \u00a340, as you will get two for the price of one deal on the food. However, even without the discount you can bag yourself a bargain from the limited pre-theatre menu and I would say that it's well worth a visit if you find yourself in Covent Garden area in need of a good feed.",

    "text": "Welcome to London my parents! To celebrate them being here, we decided to go see a show, very traditional middle class way of entertaining parents isn't it? Of course the problem with this is you have to find somewhere early to eat that serves quickly enough. Now I know what you're thinking, why not have something to eat after the show? Ingenious, but then of course that assumes that my mum isn't complaining about how her feet hurt and she's tired. So, thinking ahead, I booked a nice looking French restaurant in covent garden near to the theatre. Mum is of course picky and now on (another) diet so I thought French would suit this quite well - not too heavy and she can feel continental, fulfilling more middle class desires of hers. So along we went to Le Garrick. First impressions were nice location and good decor; Very shabby chic, iron staircase going into the basement where there were carefully placed tables in really interesting nooks and crannies. Of course they did that annoying thing of trying to squeeze in one too many tables so that everyone felt a bit awkward when moving their chair to go to the loo. You move back your chair carefully so you don't make that scraping sound on the floor and you accidentally hit the table behind you sending soup everywhere. Thankfully that didn't happen to me.. This time!!Typical prices, ranging from 12 - 18 quid. I had duck in orange sauce with wilted greens, which was a bit sweet and had rind in the sauce, not great. But the duck was nicely cooked so some points there. Dad had beef bourguignon which looked nice, although it probably should have been served in a deeper bowl. Mum had grilled lamb shank and ratatouille, which in her middle class way was described as distinctly average.All in all an average meal, nice service and good place. But around Covent Garden, there's better out there.",

A gastronomic trifecta! \u00a0There were 4 of us and we decided we wanted to do a tasting menu but they didn't have one so we created our own! We had the mussels, onion soup and fois gras (to die for!). Then we had the 24 ounce rib eye with frites, the duck confit (my favorite of the night) and the special of the day - chicken in a creamy thyme sauce. \u00a0We shared two desserts - the chocolate mousse and lemon tarte. We had a nice bottle of French Pinot Noir, soft drinks and coffee. Total bill including tax and service was 135 pounds. \u00a0I would have given 5 stars if they had a tasting menu!",

I stumbled upon Le Garrick on the internet and the place itself beat my expectation with it's intimate setting (love the underground area!) and friendly staff. As this was a year ago, I don't remember what I had but the duck come to mind! Whatever it is , I know it tasted good as I recommended the restaurant to friends straight away. With it being in London, do expect a higher price for what you order. It came out to be about \u00a325-30 a head which for good food and a special occasion can be compromised , still not bad. Book first though!",

This is the duck confit you are looking for!Didn't see much to the upstairs but had a reserved table downstairs in very tight quarters. it very much is like a maze of tables, people and thin paths between them all. Cozy would be a nice word for it. Good wine, good company and good food. We started off with the mussels in white wine which I pretty much devoured, and my other half had the onion soup which for once i didn't despise. I'm not a fan of the soup, but this one was decent to me. For our main I ordered a salad, frittes, the Canard l'orange with mashed potatoes and spinach. The frigates were great, the salad tasted like plastic. I swear the dressing was made with melted plastic. It was pretty gross and they kindly took it off the bill. The duck i had was a bit over cooked but the flavours were still good so I wasn't too bothered by it. My other half ordered the duck confit on beans which was delicious and cooked to perfection. We topped off the meal with the Chocolate fondant (what I call a Lava cake) with ice cream dessert which was just heavenly. Prices were good, staff was great, food was decent. I'll definitely go again.",

Both were delicious. Cooked perfectly, with just a little bit of twist to make it magical. Wine pairings were great. Our waiter was really friendly and patient with us. We were both grateful to have had such a wonderful meal after walking around central all afternoon on a hot summer's day.

I relax more in a restaurant that doesn't have glary lights; I feel myself kicking back and genuinely glowing, in the glow of it all!Le Garrick is one of those. Been there forever, and forever I have heard it calling to me, but never slowed down long enough to listen. Until recently that is, when my friend and I were in Covent Garden, craving somewhere charming, cosy and French. 'Oh, that'll be Le Garrick', and off we went.It's lovely, in that old fashioned, unpretentious lovely French kinda way. The staff are fun, sexy and, FRENCH (sexy by default then really) and they bob about happily, taking it all in their stride.The d\u00e9cor, effortlessly stylish, is rustic and pleasantly unrefined - wooden floors and chairs, exposed brick and boudoir wallpaper. The candle light hides any imperfections, for which I am grateful too.The food is as you'd expect from a French Brasserie - no surprises, just all the old staples, the epitome of French cooking. We tucked in to Coquilles St Jacques - seared scallops which were perfectly cooked, bouncy and succulent - and Cassolette de calamar \u00e0 la plancha au piment d'espelette - calamari in the most exquisite, intensely rich, decadent, sweet buttery sauce with ginger, coriander and chilli. I have no words to really do this sauce justice, only to say that, had I been at home I would have undoubtedly licked the bowl clean. Subsequently, I ate far too much French bread, mopping up every last drop. Rib-eye and frites, an old brasserie dependable, was as good as any; and beef Bourguignon was unctuous and plentiful with another sauce to blow your mind. Aromatic, more'ish and deeply satisfying - another bowl-licker!Meanwhile, we enjoyed a rather quaffable 2007 Gevrey Chambertin, mindful not to quaff too quickly. And as the candles flickered, and the place gently hummed with mellifluous background noise, for just a moment I imagined I was in my favourite city in the world - Paris, in a 1940's foxy full skirted dress, with my French lover, Beno\u00eet, smoking and drinking Vermouth. I blink and it's gone. But what a lovely evening it has been, avec mon amis, Jeremy.",

You have to ask for more bread to dip the sauce. The snack rilettes is good. I like the tiny pickles on the top. They have frog legs as appetizer too. It tastes good and tender. The duck breast in orange sauce is interesting. The meat is ok tender though. Their recommendations on wine is really good too. Even though the seating is a bit tiny, the whole experience is awesome.",

They've got the mood just right with candlelit tables and old fashioned decor and the menu has a great selection. We shared the fondue to start and I have duck in orange sauce for my main both of which were exquisite and my creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e dessert was the best I've had in a while! The staff looked after us really well and were all lovely, and the complimentary shot at the end of the meal really did remind me of being in France! Recommend.",

The service was really great; we had great attention and very prompt, in keeping with our pre-theatre schedule. The food was really nice and the husband said his mussels were probably some of the best he's ever had.It's a great place for a pre-theatre dinner.",

    "text": "Beautiful little brasserie serving French bistro fare in a quaintly setting. Big windows, amber lighting (good for dates), and joyful, friendly staff. They offer your standard bisfro fare of various steaks-- onglette, entrecot-- a fish of the day, mussels, and surprisingly, vegetarian dishes outside of the usual dreary mushroom risotto (\u00a39.95). On my most recent visit I sampled the quinoa and roasted vegetable dish which was excellent. Fresh and full of flavour, it wasn't just some lame runner-up to the rest of the menu as is frequently the case in French places. Pricing is moderate, with most mains costing in the mid-teens range and wines between \u00a321 - 48. Upstairs the seating is a bit cosy but fine.....the real highlight is downstairs. Creep down the spiral staircase and encounter what feels like a speakeasy: low, vaulted ceilings, tables for 4 or 6 people each ensconced in their own little area. Overall a nice choice for a chilled dinner experience.",

In the hustle and bustle of Covent Garden it's hard to believe that a gem like this exist- a beautiful French restaurant with 30 years of history. We were seated upstairs which itself was beautiful, dark and romantic, containing less than 10 tables which made it very cosy to be in. But when we return we must remember to request for a seat downstairs as it was another world down there, discovering it as I was making my way down the rustic metal spiral staircase to the toilets. It was like a barrel cellar area, low ceiling with little booth for diners to sit in with a bit more privacy. It was extremely romantic.I like a host that is decisive and confidence enough to suggest us wines when we asked for her choice and that was exactly what Marion did. We left it to her and I can honestly say for me who doesn't usually like wine, she made a very good choice, fruity full-bodied red wine that had a nice smooth aftertaste. It was a great pairing with my Cassoulet De Toulouse hence why she chose it.But before we started our mains we both shared a cheese fondue cooked with white wine and herbs - for two to share. It was incredible, runny, smooth and creamy full of flavour with the added wine and herbs. Although my favourite part had to be the harden bits around the edge that was stringy and slightly elastic with an intense cheese flavour. \u00a0We were given slices of baguettes to accompany it and was even offered more after we finished- very generous. Where I ordered the Cassoulet De Toulouse which consisted of \u00a0lingot beans served with duck, sausages and pork my boyfriend ordered his most loved Boeuf Bourguignon. My main was lovely, beautiful slow cooked succulent duck and pork belly which went extremely well with the lingot beans. But the flavours could not compare to my boyfriend's Boeuf Bourguignon. Where my dish was cooked in a very light refreshing tomato flavour it was that rich beef stock in red wine in the Boeuf Bourguignon that won me over.The beef in the Boeuf Bourguignon was tender, chunky, mixed with halved potatoes which could have been of a more fluffy variety but still very pleasant. The broth also had a nice sweetness from the carrots. It was a bit runny but there was a lot of depth and really flavourful. If I wasn't so full I would have got some bread to dish up the rest of the sauce. Overall it was a beautiful meal. Sadly the prices does remind you you're in a tourist area as the prices for mains vary from \u00a312.50- \u00a324.95.There is also a 2 course set menu available at \u00a313.50 with the choice of onglet or moules as your main for those who are looking for a fairer price. Even with the high prices, in return you do get a very unique experience, homely french cooking in a old lively French restaurant conveniently located next to Covent Garden. I will definitely be back for sure even if it is to see our host again, Marion who made our day. It would be great to try out the other dishes too and get a chance to visit the seating area downstairs. A great discovery and looking forward to our next visit :).",
