Boy they're good. When I found out they had a shop within walking distance of my office I shrieked in delight (really). This place is almost dangerously close to my desk. I could be in trouble/bankrupt.I'm knocking off one star for their lack of indoor seating. In the winter you either freeze your gonads off on the outdoor seats or skulk back to the office to eat your prize.",

If you like Pies, and not just a casual liking for Pies, I mean a core shaking love that has changed your life, then this is the place for you. Unwrapping that joyous little cardboard box and digging your eager fork into the pie is like opening the greatest christmas present in the world! \u00a0The only bad thing about these pies is that eventually each pie comes to an end... \u00a0Get a loyalty card and try each and everyone of these pastry fellas, then eventually you will be rewarded with a free pie- hooray!",

I like the concept of the place and the fun imagery with the little icons for the different pies. I had the chicken of Aragon pie with mash and minted peas and gray. Mmm. Pastry was crisp, filling tasty, great mash and peas and gravy and good portion size.Perfect comfort food and good prices too. Another example to show that good food and quality doesn't have to be expensive.I wish there were more locations! This one on the Southbank is slightly tucked away so you have to seek it out and closes fairly early in the evening (we just made it before closing).",

I've tried both the Wild Mushroom & Asparagus and the Chicken versions and they were equally delicious. The gravy is vegetarian which is a nice touch, and the take-out trays the deliciousness are put in are cute. Staff at this branch were friendly and efficient and gave good recommendations, and there a variety of interesting soft drinks to choose from. The only issue I have is the mashed potato which tasted a little too \"minty\" (cross contamination with the peas!?) and a little too baby-paste smooth for my tastes, but it's the pies you come from and they are A1. I can even overlook the groan-inducing puns on the menu (\"groovy\" instead of gravy, etc). Bravo! Will be back for another fix soon.",

The only downside is seating is VERY limited. There's one little counter that holds about 2 diners at a time. However there are a lot of little tables outside and in good weather I'm sure they are packed because the food is amazing, inexpensive and filling. I will be back here when it gets a bit warmer. Also, you can get pies to take away which is a fabulous idea and even cheaper.",

I waited patiently for about half an hour for the previous customers to leave, but it was worth it. \u00a0On the other side, there is plenty of seating outside - perhaps this is one for a drier day...The upside is that this is in a new group of shops and stalls just off the main South Bank walkway - easy enough to find, but hidden enough to be quieter.",

But you get my point right ?There is a tiny amount in indoor seating, and mostly covered seats outside. I'm not sure what it would be like on a wet day, but on a bright crisp winter's day, it's pretty awesome.Considering the location, prices are really reasonable. You can get a pie for less than some cups of coffee in surrounding stores. If you don't want to sit outside the shop and eat, get your pie to go - you're only a few steps away from the Thames. Picture it... 3C outside, beautiful blue sky, clippers, rib tours and other boats going by and the steam wafting up from the hot, fresh pie you just bit into. And not just any pie - venison, beef, chicken, weird fruity stuff that should have been eaten by the thing that's in the pie but they chose to put into the pie instead. Then the scene gets ruied slightly by the cry of \"ow, fooey, bah, darn that's hot\"... But once the swearing settles down, it's you, an amazing city, the river that runs through it and meat and sauce in pastry. What more do you want?",

There were so many pies that I wanted to try and after eating the mushroom pie, I wanted to order more to go. I suggest asking for the sauce on the side because your pie will get drowned. I made that mistake and had to struggle draining it. The pie is perfect without the extra sauce. It's extremely flavorful and moist, the crust is perfectly flaky and not dry. I wish they had this in NYC. They would make bank!",

    "text": "I found Pieminister via a Buzzfeed post that recommended 21 cheap eats in London. True to its words, a pie and a lemonade came out to 6.5 pounds, which is a great bargain in London. Pieminister is just a few minutes walk from Big Ben and London Eye, and offers a great snack (or meal) to your stroll along the Thames River. I was indecisive between the Minty Lamb pie (seasonal and a contest winner) and the MooDog pie (because smoked bacon, duh). I went with the Minty Lamb pie at the last minute because I was told that there would be gravy and because it is a contest winner. I was rather disappointed when I opened my takeaway box and there was no gravy! Should I have asked for gravy with a wink and a nod? Who knows - just make sure that you ask for it because the pie was a little dry without the gravy. Albeit, the crust was flaky and buttery and the filling hit the proper savory level, but I still wanted the pie to be just bursting with umami flavor. Don't get me wrong - it was a good pie, and I would come back to try another one but I definitely missed the gravy.",

I went to the Pieminister stall in Borough Market because I had heard great things about it and therefore had fairly high expectations. Upon arriving at the stall I was pretty overwhelmed by the number of choices, but ultimately opted for the Tipsy Chick per recommendation of the person working the stall. I was super excited to try it (even more so because of the cute box it came in!) but was sadly disappointed on the first bite. The crust wasn't flaky enough (the top crust came off in one big chunk) and the stuffing was just alright. It literally tasted like a regular chicken pot pie you can get in the states. So overall I thought my pie was underwhelming to say the least. It wasn't awful, but definitely nothing special.Also - for the health conscious, beware. Even though their pies are pretty small, they each have ~600 calories and LOTS of fat.",

We got the Minty Lamb pie with gravy (british lamb, mint, carrot, swede & red wine) and the MooDog pie (Brewdog 5AM Saint Ale, british beef steak & free range british smoked bacon) with mash and minty mushy peas. The pastry was so crispy and flaky, the mash was done perfectly and the mint in the mushy peas wasn't overpowering the taste of the peas - \u00a0just the right amount of mint flavor. Both the lamb and moodog pies were delicious and tasty, but my favorite was the moodog. It was pretty much like eating homemade beef stew. We also ordered a latte from them which was perfect for the cool and windy day we had last week. The locale of the store wasn't hard to find, but walking along South Bank, you would definitely miss it because it's kind of tucked in a corner behind another restaurant. They are in a little area with small shops and a few cafes. Also there are no seats inside the store - only tables outdoors. It was a little windy and chilly when we went so she provided us with some blankets to use.",

I found pieminister thru yelp and decided to give it a try.One of our pies had chicken and ham and the other one had venison meat. There was a nice little sitting area right outside the stand, (and because the weather was great) it was nice to just sit outside. Flavor and taste wise I would recommend this place for a quick/cute/filling lunch! I didn't expect for the pie to be as filling as I thought. If you order the motherload you get all the toppings, but if not you get one side and the option of gravy is free. I would recommend just getting the pie + 1 side, but the motherload was nice for the photo!",

I realize that it doesn't look the most appetizing, but don't let its appearance deceive you.I ordered the Moo classic pie (beef steak) with a side of mash and it was amazing! The filling was so meaty and flavorful, the crust was crispy and flaky, and it all went perfectly with the gravy and mash. It also helped that it was freezing cold outside (I'm from California though so I honestly think any whether under 65 degrees F is freezing) and even though we had to sit outside, the steaming hot food warmed my insides up. Honestly, I tried some other traditional British food on my trip but none of it was that good except for Pieminister. And compared to how expensive food is in London, I can't get over how cheap and filling this meal was! Highly recommend going.",

I was walking around on my last day and randomly spotted this place tucked away in a corner near the London eye and went for it.I ordered the moo and blue, deer stalker, chicken Aragon and the free ranger with mash and peas. The crust was great and had a tender and flaky texture to it. The free ranger and chicken Aragon had a chicken based gravy inside along with some veggies. It tasted identical to a chicken pot pie from the states and had a very thick gravy. It was good but was nothing to brag about.My favorite was the beef based pies, the moo and blue and deer stalker. The gravy inside the pie wasn't thick nor thin and went better with the pie than the chicken gravy. Also, it was the perfect ratio of gravy, meat and veggies.The beef pies was a lot better than the chicken pies and I would recommend the moo and blue. Pie isn't really my cup of tea but it hits the spot when you're hungry.",

But get off your high horse -- not everything needs to be in the running for a Michelin star to be a familiar go-to. You don't need to have any sentimental (or genetic) connection with the good ol' rainy U.K. to see that a lot of these pies are simple, yet comforting.So in other words, I feel like I'm lazing around in a blanket burrito whenever I go to Pieminister.I conveniently choose to forget that I don't actually eat red meat because the Free Ranger (chicken, ham, leek, and thyme) is just that good. And it says a lot about Pieminister that I don't go into gastrointestinal distress a few hours after scarfing down the Free Ranger because my body usually protests against red meat. In Pieminister's defense, you can hardly taste what little ham there is though because this pie is essentially the chicken pot pie of your childhood.It's heavy and can hardly be any good for you. But the crust is oh so crispy, the gravy is perfect, and the chicken is juicy. It'll warm you right up on a cold winter day (but good luck finding anywhere to eat it because you'll have to duke it out for the two seats inside) and it'll give you the energy to thoroughly explore the Tate Modern afterwards.And it'll only cost you \u00a35. Where else can you find a filling meal in London for a fiver?!",

    "text": "While working nearby, I had to make sure that my team and I were well taken care of during late nights and weekends stuck at our computers. \u00a0Because nothing is ever easy, some of the guys were vegetarians, while others wanted their meat and couldn't have cared less about \"garnish\". \u00a0Thankfully, after fruitlessly digging through menus to find a compromise spot, one of my colleagues grabbed me by the arm and said \"Come along, son. \u00a0I'll show you how it's done.\" \u00a0Pieminister wound up being lunch for my team nearly every day I was there. \u00a0I just couldn't get enough of the Matador and MooDog (which is a Moo, but with bacon...which makes everything better). \u00a0My vegetarian guys loved the Wild Shroom (mushrooms & asparagus pie) and Saag Pie-Neer (just what it sounds like - in a huge flaky crust), while those with the hunter's spirit fell for the Deer Stalker and Chili con Carnage (both of which feature venison). \u00a0With a pie and 2 sides only costing \u00a38, I also knew I wasn't going to break the bank to buy everyone lunch every day.While sitting outside and watching life on the Thames and the riverwalk go by looked attractive, I never got a chance to enjoy that. \u00a0Pick a good day and enjoy the neighborhood before those new apartment buildings finish being built and the area gets crowded. \u00a0If you're taking away as I was though, call ahead to make sure that your pie is available, as this location is small and they have run out of stock on some of my requests. \u00a0Also, while you're here picking up, do be sure to load up on any additions to your pie - the bottle of HP sauce and whatever else your heart desires are on the little pickup counter just behind you when facing the cashier. \u00a0Don't drown the pie though - they make them with love, and you'll want to taste it.Oh - and don't forget to get a pie punch-card. \u00a0You can quickly line up enough pies to get a free one, and it just doesn't get better than that.",

Tucked away in the market you might miss it but its worth the look to find it. \u00a0There is a plethora of various meat pies to choose from and by far the friendliest of staff. \u00a0Where eating there or for takeaway it is well worth the adventure to find and experience.",

Came here after a biking tour and had worked up an appetite, good thing too because the Mothership is huge! But also a great price at \u00a38.50, and I had to finish it, it was too good to let go to waste.",

    "text": "This was probably one of our favourite meals while visiting London. We loved the eclectic atmosphere of the shops, caf\u00e9s and restaurants in this little nook off the side of a main walkway. We ordered the moo pie and the chicken of Aragon pie and they were both lovingly stuffed with delicious ingredients. If that's not enough, the crust was flaky and tender and perfect. They have a good thing going here. With a few other locations, this place owes it's success to quality food, good prices and servers who seem to enjoy and support this brand. Back to the food, the gravy that was generously poured over the pie was flavourful and complimented both both the brown sauce and white sauce filled pie. We ordered a side of mushy peas to go along with it and these taste fresh and bright with a hint of mint, yet had the comforting texture of a mash. I definitely recommend this place for anyone craving a belly warming meal or snack in London. Your stomach and wallet will thank you!",
