    "text": "Well what can I say about this dive. We went there on a saturday night in a large party to celebrate a birthday. We arrived at 6pm in order to take advantage of the lessons. these are supposed to start at 6pm but didnt due to the late arrival of the instructor, so they started over an hour late! Upon arrival my wife and some of her friends visited the toilets and were absolutlely disgusted in the state they were in, public toilets are better cleaned!. When we sat down to eat the plated and cutlery stuck to the cheap plastic tableclothes which obviously dont get cleaned regularly, and it would be hard to see the dirt as the lighting is so dim. We were served our main course and despite complaining that there was a serving missing, it never arrived. I went to drink out of a glass and cut my lip on the sharp broken edge, again due to the dim lighting I did not notice this, I complained to the staff and was just given a clean glass with no apology. This place also probably breaks fire regs and health and safety rules due to the large numbers of people in there, many who block the aisles between tables, and because of this a waitress( sic) dropped a whole tray of orders on the floor, which went over peoples feet etc , again no apology and no attempt made to stop people walking through the area and potentially slipping up. If you enjoy salsa the dancefloor is too cramped to do any dancing and the bar area becomes another makeshift cramped dance area. This place is also full of letchorous men so women beware you will get touched up!",

    "text": "The WORST night I've ever had in London!!! I was really curious about this place, some friends told me about it good things others bad things but as always you can never say anything unless you go and watch it for yourself. here is what will happen if you go to try to find out.- unwelcoming people that will just ask you to pay money and more money with their large faces, as if they are doing a favour to receive you (this has never happened to me in other salsa places, usually latin people are really nice)- the hottest environment you can ever find (and i don't mean it like hot for good place, it is actually hot as hell) as soon as you enter you may want to take out your coat or jacked, it is insupportable.- the music and the people is ok at the beginning.- later if you want to dance you will end with somebody else's sweat (disgusting!!) but if you don't mind I'll tell you that the room is so big that this will happen anywhere inside the place. (truly.. disgusting!)- i tend to forget my camera in my coat so when me and my friends want to take some pictures i just go back to the cloak room and say please can i have my coat back for a second and grab my camera and give my coat back. this has happened to me three times and the two first nobody had any trouble. but in this place they wanted to charge me again. \u00bf? it makes no sense!!- so if you have a complain, talk to the bouncer who will be happy to find any word you say to use it as excuse to hit you and show that he is stronger than you. This is what make the best of the night, i asked to talk with the manager in a really calm way and he just started yelling at me, man definitely you should never tolerate this behaviour from anybody, specially if you are paying for something. oh yeah i almost forget, and he will call his other two bouncer friends because they want to make sure they have the last word. I am terrible disappointed from this place and i will publish this as much as i can, but my recommendation is, 'find it out your self' you'll see that it is not worth it!!! there are plenty of better places to learn and dance salsa in London!! I can assure that!!",

This place on a saturday night was absolutely rammed full of people, it was hot, sweaty and disgusting and sadly so too were most of the men. We danced with a few people since that is what we had come for but it seems to attract people that think they are amazing dancers and if you are not up to their standard they don't want to know -even after they have asked you to dance without knowing if you are any good!A lot of sweaty, sleezy guys that are there just to grind around with a few women taking advantage of the stupidly packed dance floor to do this! I'm sure some lovely people go there too but hopefully they will find out there are better places to go and leave the rest of them there !The bar prices I seem to recall were average for London prices really.",

    "text": "I've been to bar salsa far too many times to admit.I had somewhat mixed feelings about it initially, and I grew to like it. However lately I've been thinking this place is a bit stuffy, no place to sit, cramped dancefloor with huge pillars everywhere.It has dance classes almost every day of the week (except saturdays I believe).The dance classes can be a bit hit & miss, sometimes the quality of teaching is good, and other times it's obvious that the classes are just there to pull in the crowds. If you want to learn salsa go on Mondays and Sundays (less stuffy so you have enough space to actually practice, and also the crowd is more salsa inclined), if you're just looking for a new afterwork hangout, wednesdays and thursdays are good.Having said that I've had a fair share of some absolutely fantastic nights and met a lot of people and basically learnt to salsa from the enourmous amounts of time I've dedicated to social dancing in this place. I've grown to love and hate this place, so I can only give it 4 stars",

Finallyyy!.... however it wasn't what we expected.First off, E ordered \"chips and salsa\"-- and promptly got exactly what the Brits call chips with their favorite side-- and what we Americans call french fries and mayo. Fries were fantastic, but otherwise, J and I ordered nachos and got something like melted cheese and old beef on cheesey Doritos. We also got a drink special, Tequila Sunrise, and, for one who absolutely loveeess my tequila, didn't really get me tipsy (at ALL), but I guess that was the lack of alcohol in it (and cheap couple quid drank). The restaurant itself reminded me extremely of Senor Frogs in Hawaii-- colorful mustard and teal walls, a dance floor and televised stage, and lots of wall decor. However, there was a salsa teacher who KNEW just how to shake his rump. That's what we call dinner and entertainment!",

Talks english very well, however very arrogant and patronising. The other guy who is bigger and taller is extremely rude. Its all about power and demonstrating that they are in control. I will not be bringing my good lady to this venue sadly. I would not want to be embarrassed by the staff. I would highly recommend that Salsa lovers go to Floradita. Its located at 100 Wardour Street. Only 2 minutes away from bar salsa. The staff at Floradita are professional well spoken and offer a very high level of service. One other point the staff at Floradita are much more friendly. Floradita has excellent food, great drinks, cleaner environment and good facilities. I am concerned about the facilities at Bar Salsa and may report them as I do suspect that they breach health and safety regs. Thought I saw a cockroach near the food area, located underneath the stairwell. But when I blinked it had run underneath something. Having said all of this, there is something that makes Bar Salsa better than other bars in London. The music is very good. There is a DJ by the name of Jorge who plays at Bar Salsa. In my opinion he plays the best music in London. If DJ jorge could be shifted to Floradita, then that would be it. Floradita would be the best latin venue in the world !",

I used to go very often on a Thursday, and it was ok, then it got weird. There is an eerie vibe about this place i.e: lots of latino men/ and others, and well, lots of women who are looking to score.Nobody seems that serious about dancing salsa.This place is very commercial, so those who are looking for a latin vibe- forget it. This place is good for laughs, and to sit and WATCH the lessons, then remember the moves and apply them to the dancefloor. Don't pay! Well yes, take a few lessons then dance, you'll enjoy it more that way. Also, Friday and Saturday- VERY packed!",

I'm not a fan of this kind of music, never learned to dance at it, unless I always like watching it -especially salsa, tango. Salsa! club is in Leicester Square therefore easy to find. Despite the fact that the entry is \u00a310, when I ventured there on a Friday night, it was crowded. Not a cheap venue though as you enter the vibe gets you. If you have some sense of rythm you will find yourself moving or in better cases even dancing \u00a0that salsa what you know or what you can pick up; there are plenty of people there who know what they are doing. Allow yourself some shots of tequila (so you don't have to hold a bottle or glass in your hand) and get down to the dancefloor and feel the passion in the air. Good music all night long, and girls! if you're standing alone for couple of minutes there will be at least 3 latino-lovers around you asking you to dance. Go for it!",

The bar was PACKED and the crowd was between the ages of 18-65. It was a very odd mix of people. Sometimes that age difference can be fun, it makes the night feel like a family gathering, however thats not really what I look for when I go out.I felt like I had do cover up for the older men, I felt naked lol.The place itself was good, nice drinks for nice prices and good music. It felt kind of like a latin beach resort, very summery and very much Copacabana. Pro's: Good music, good feel to the night Con's: Wrong crowd",

Now, apart from the fact that we are talking about a jug of Margarita for \u00a310.00 (yes, that's right - \u00a310.00!!!) the free dance lesson goes for more like half an hour! So, it is definately value for money! The staff are friendly and welcoming (mostly anyway) but if they are not, just think about the half price cocktails! :-) Great place to try something different FOR FREE (did i mention that already?) and if you like it and want to keep learning it is only \u00a38.00 for two more hours. The atmosphere is charged, with a little bit of pressure (from yourself that is) to be a really good salsa dancer - even if you are only a beginner! It's a lot of laughing, dancing (which, lets face it girls, is great for the figure right?) and feel-good music because it is all Latin American! Good place to take your friends, and even to meet that special someone as i think most of the guys are there for that very reason! ;-) Lots of room to dance, but if it's packed then that is restricted although the staff have worked that out too!! Good times to be had here people!",

The salsa lessons are great for beginner-intermediate dancers, as they enable you master some steps before the real boogying of the night starts, so that you a) do not embarrass yourself on the dancefloor and b) will have met a few people that you can then dance with. i have only ever had tapas here (which were simply so-so), and that is due to the fact that the main meal menu simply isn't exciting enough to entice me into parting with my money. all in all, Salsa! is lovely for salsa, lessons, and pre-party drinks \u00a0but i wouldn't complete my night here.",

As someone that comes from a latin background and the warm city of Miami, this place is simply a little glimpse of home. Its beautiful tropical interior and lively atmosphere makes it a great place to escape the city of London and transport yourself to the world of Salsa. Their communal dance class is highly inviting to beginners and later on becomes a hot latin dance floor where everyone is welcome to bust a move. If dancing isn't your thing, their 50% off happy hour will definitely catch your eye. In my case, the Yum Tum was the thing to catch my eye. The deliciously creamy mixture of Kahl\u00faa and Baileys milkshake with a chocolate drizzle is just what I recommend on their signature cocktail menu to cool yourself off from the dance floor. Overall, I would say this place isn't simply a bit of latin life in the city of London, but rather is a worthy multicultural experience that I highly recommend for a night out on the town.",

Which was ok, but not ideal. The interior of the bar is beautiful and definitely fits the vibe of the whole place. The bar is absolute chaos, which may have just been because it was so crowded, but I think they could throw an extra bartender or two in there to get people in and out faster. Also they only had one credit card machine so they had to wait until another customer was done to ring up someone else- this definitely slowed things down. That being said the staff was very friendly and the drinks we had were quite good. I appreciated that they had a wide mix of cocktails. I also think they should add like two extra tables in the corners of the dance floor to leave your empty drinks. There were too many empty glasses rolling around on the floor and that felt dangerous. All in all it's a decent club but I hope they fix the things I mentioned above.",

There are A LOT of beginners, which means many people without courtesy on the dance floor. The place had a good size dance floor. The bartenders were slow. I just wanted water and it took quite a long time. Entry price was great. Overall, ok place, but if you can only go to dance salsa at one location, go someplace else.",

We asked if the volume could be turned down, and the staff obliged us, but it was still quite loud. \u00a0We ordered nachos with our drinks but were told that there were none available, so we opted for some wings, which were teriyaki glazed with hot sauce (weird combination for the theme of the establishment). \u00a0I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich which was served on a very stale bun and was so over marinated that it was probably completely cooked before it hit the grill. This was served with a paltry side salad instead of the fries listed on the menu. \u00a0When the dessert menu was delivered and our server announced there were no churros available. \u00a0We guessed that the fryer must have been out of service. Wish we'd been told this prior to eating here. \u00a0So disappointing. We won't be back.",

Finally the waitress came over and told us something got messed up and she just had to re-put in the order. She said it'd be about 10 minutes. We waited about 20 minutes when they finally slowly brought out our food. It was not that good and my friends' steak fajitas were not super warm and most of the pieces of steak were fatty. To make it worse, no one came over during our meal to ask how it was, even after having to wait so long. Would NOT recommend this place to others. Don't waste your time.",

I've never been really keen in dancing in public places, but here is a totally different story!Raelly nice club with a warm atmosphere, two step far from Leicester square and Is almost impossible to not found someone to dance with, do not expect professional dancers, everyone's there with the only purpouse to enjoying themselves.if happens to be at Salsa club on tuesday, you can also join the dance class.Leave your \u00a0judgmental glances at the doorstep, feel the music, have a drink ( i recommend the mohito!) Unfortunately Is a bit expensive (10\u00a3 the entrance fee) and sometimes the queue is endless, is not an every-night-club.",

    "text": "I'm a regular and yet always seem to forget to check in here. I've been on most of the nights of the week but my day is Monday. I've been dancing for a while and learning from Mario for most of the time, and yet his advanced class still pushes me. Eldina is also a good teacher and while Clement isn't someone I take a class from, he's always friendly and ready to demonstrate a new move. The crowd is good and there's a good host of regulars there. As with most places there are the people who just want to try and pick up people, but they're relatively easy to identify and ladies, if you don't like who you're dancing with, just say NO! The music is fun, there's a good mix of Salsa, Bachata and Merengue tracks. It gets crowded from 9:30 to 11 or so, after the classes but quietens down a little after that, guess people need their beauty sleep (although that sometimes includes me, I do like to dance but life must go on too!). After 11pm there's a bit more space, and it's easier to dance. If you're nervous about going there and not knowing the moves, get there early and take a lesson, and afterwards, get a quick drink but carry on dancing. Most people there, and especially the good ones, are happy to dance with a beginner, I promise that none of them (well, maybe just a couple) were born dancing . We all had to learn and we all know what it was like to go to a club and ask someone to dance, especially a couples dance!As for food and drinks, happy hour is until 8:30 I think, and Mondays has 2 for 1 mojitos all night, what's not to like? Bar prices are standard and they have some good cocktails. There's a restaurant as well, although they slowly clear it as it gets later. The booths remain though so you can still order until kitchen closes (I've not had a problem ordering food at 10:30). I generally go for the Tapas, guess it's cause I don't want to dance on a full stomach, but the burgers and fajitas look good. For me, Calamares, croquetas and sweet potato fries hit the spot, freshly fried and damn tasty!See you next Monday!",

There are some great dancers who come to this place - and some not so great but very amusing ones too, nonetheless everyone always seems happy to be there. Watching from the side, the instructor is very clear and easy to follow. I presume they also have times where it is just free-for-all salsa dancing without the lessons.I have not tried much of the bar area, nor have I participated in the dancing but this is soon to be amended. On the other hand I would DEFINITELY recommend going for dinner (and maybe a post-meal salsa lesson - leave time to digest though!)",

No entry fee to the bar, just rock on up. Doesn't matter if you're a seriously uncoordinated soul with two left feet and no rhythm, or a stalwart salsa champion who wants a fun warm up- you can do this class.If you've been happily enticed, stay for the following lessons (session one 7.30-8.30, session two 8.30-9.30) which are either \u00a35 for one hour, or \u00a38 for both classes. STUDENT ALERT: \u00a35 for two hours of classes, BARGAIN.5 levels of classes ranging from absolute beginner to seriously advanced so you will always find the correct entry level to suit your ability. They run the classes in different areas of the bar so you can focus on your group.After the classes the whole bar turns into a club night, which you can stay and dance at for free if you're already in the bar, otherwise to just come to the club, I think there is a cover charge from 9pm...Teachers are great, music is awesome, really fun atmosphere and good opportunity to practice dancing with lots of people so don't be afraid to go alone!",

    "text": "There are sooo many better places to go for salsa. Ok, in the week this is a good spot, but don't go there on a Saturday night for serious dancing. On a Saturday night music is mixed, some salsa tracks but mostly they play any chart music and the dancing could vaguely be considered as Merengue - or more like an excuse for horrible sweaty men to get up way too close and personal. If you go on a weekend, take it all with a big pinch of salt (or strong drink). There are often lots of hen dos during the wedding season. Drinks in happy hour are reasonable but pricey outside of that (well, it is Leicester Square, so that's excusable). I've only eaten here once and it was ok from what I remember, but then my expectations were not high. If you're after a fun night out dancing with friends but not necessarily salsa - and especially if you're out 'on the pull', then this could well be the place for you, but for serious salseros.... I would keep a wide berth!",
