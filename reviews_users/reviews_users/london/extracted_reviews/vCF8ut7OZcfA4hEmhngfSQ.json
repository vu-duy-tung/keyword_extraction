I didn't put 5 stars just because of the price, but honestly a lot of work has been put into the execution (see pictures).",

    "text": "Aqui Se Cocina Con Cari\u00f1o.This is the motto. So let's see if they put enough care in the food or it's just a nice spanish sentence.Eat there on a thursday, 4 people, no booking. The place is crowded (this should be a good sign, but in Shoreditch well... even the off-license stores are crowded in the evening!), but they manage to let us sit in a shared table. Oh yes! I like shared tables, it allows me to look at more plates and have a nice chat! Unfortunately our table sharers are french.... nothing against the country but damn you are snob! anyway..Basically the menu is built over a tapas-alike concept: there are no appetizers or main courses, just small dishes to be shared among everybody. The idea is nice, but I felt a bit in a \"aperitivo\" time rather than a proper dinner.Round of cocktails (pisco sour as recommended by.. well by everybody in the restaurant), good but not delicious, and then we are ready to receive our plates!In general, we have peruvian cuisine put in a contemporary world: that means for example that we have ceviche but its taste is far smoother than what I tasted in Peru, with less lime and more overall less spicy. That's my main critique: there's nothing hot here! how can you have a peruvian menu with no hotness? spice that dish madame! ah and by the way no lomo saltado... why one of the most famous peruvian dishes is out of the menu? Mysteries...On a tasting level, the raw fish is definitely suggested, every single dish we tried was good, the only issue missing was spices! everything was just a bit too blend... pity! Recommended: the skewers. Now, I usually avoid skewers as they are usually roasted in advance and then re heated, which makes them lose juicies, but here they did a very good job, the meat is moist and the sauces are delicious, not to be missed!Take a minute to choose your wine: I may be biased, but I love south american wines: gimme peruvian or chilean or argentinian wines and maurizio will be a happy guy! and here, as expected , we have a very nice selection of peruvian wines: personally I usually go for white wines in sharing settings, especially in places with lots of fishes and only white meat (mainly chicken). For my personal taste the choice was for the Torrontes, argentinian, which is the only south american grape in the menu, but everything is worthing the money (I could also recommend adobe or gran hacienda, nice drinks!).In conclusion, it's a good place, but in the end you are feeling something is missing, as everything seems just an appetizer! and I really hope thery are gonna kick some spices in the next future, this is something really missing in a south american restaurant!",

    "text": "How funny! Andina made the weekly Yelp the night I made my first Trip. Coinciding with the release of Paddington the movie, I, escaping all the way from the deepest dark depths of South London, travelled on the Marmalade Line all the way to Shoreditch for Dinner, for recipes all the way from the Depths of Peru. The warm and cozy climate inside was a welcoming escape from the cold night air and inside, almost tropical and ever so welcoming to our ever expanding food party. I've oft walked past seeing brunchers stabbing at poached eggs with spears of asparagus, quinoa tumbling about smoked trout, that's what I'm about, but dinner was a rather limited unceremonious affair. Clumsy service came in batches, although I was excited by the array of little plates; L\u00facuma pat\u00e9, native to Andean Peru, a kind of avaocadoey textured but sweet onion-pumpkin tasting paste was a cloying but an interesting paste cleaned up by the Black Kingfish & Fig Tiradito: Farmed and sustainable (slivers of) kingfish, with (an eighth of a piece of some very small non) seasonal British figs and (a few sprinkles of) pomegranate (pips), (however I couldn't taste the exquisite tropical tanginess I was expecting from the) yuzu tiger's milk, but it was 'ceviched' as Andina's big sister knows how nevertheless. The Beef Anticucho skewers, were stamp sized pieces of meat. I'd wanted a huge piece of beating heart and these mere dry morsels did not meet my hungry expectations. \u00a0The Causa Misti was a half a spear of green asparagus (may I add, cut in to two) with (a few quarters of) heirloom tomatoes (Yes, so really 1 and a half unripe green cherry tomatoes), with (a sliver of) avocado, (a quenelle of) cold potato mash and (I don't know what) omega 3 boosting Sacha Inchi oil boosted, but it wasn't my confidence in knowing I'd not need a bear sized Marmalade sandwich at home. Andina, named after a strong pioneering woman, had probably had a hearty Peruvian breakfast to start the day, but Peru-sing the menu, it looks more of morning place rather than a place to wind up or down for dinner, despite the Pisco Sours being first class fluffy.Well, you could always start the day with an egg (white based cocktail) here.",

    "text": "We checked out this newly opened Peruvian restaurant in Shoreditch area and were happy to have gone. The restaurant is actually huge as the have lower level dinning area in addition to the main room. They also have and their so called music room which looks ideal for big parties. I personally like the decor of the restaurant, it is modern/minimalist yet homely and clearly Peruvian. I enjoy that they have a juice bar in addition to the full bar. I also like that despite the kitchen being in the main room we left without smelling like food. My only gripe is about the cold draught that enters each time the huge and talll main door opens eapecially in winter time. As for our food, I had the Chicharrones. I love it a lot I wish they have it in bigger serving portion. I love the combination of chillis, onion and pork in a mini clay bowl. My husband on the other hand had the Chupe, which was a stew with potatoes, corn quinoa and shrimp and small chunks of eggs on a chili sauce. Even though it was meant for my husband, I think I ate half of it because it was just that good (lots of love for the husband for letting me share his food). It was a perfect blend of all the ingredients without one over powering the other especially the chilli. In addition, my husband also had the Yucca which is fried cassava with herb dip on the side. My husband liked and enjoyed it and I say it was good but not my favorite. As for my main dish, I had the Lomo which is a rib eye cut steak with broad beans on the side and lucuma pure. The meat was really tender and well marinated and the lucuma was creamy and sweet with a hint of uniques spices and herbs blended in. Overall, the service here was attentive and friendly, the food is unique yet fantastic, the decor is simple but exudes calmness. My husband enjoyed ourselves here and highly recommend it to all. Its wonderful seeing \u00a0excellent restaurants like this one in our side of London.",

Throw in a few Pisco punches and you are looking at minimum \u00a340 each. I had the Ceviche Andina, tamalitos and chicken causa. The ceviche was spicy and fantastic. The tamalito was essentially quinoa with feta, not a revelation. The causa was surprisingly light and tasty. Highlights were the chicken tamarind I tasted. Definitely order this. And of course, the fried cassava is a must. But do not leave without ordering the dulce de leche pastries with ice cream. Holy shit, Batman, they are amazing.",

We were shown to our table right away and the service was really efficient, New York style on the ball which we could do with more of. Another plus is that there was no mention of time slot for the table. This is the way it should be.The ceviche classico was good and fresh tasting but really mouth puckering sour. I'm no expert in ceviche but imagined a more balanced flavour profile. Chicken and avacado causa was OK, a bit bland, one dimensional. Skewers of lamb and chicken thighs with special sauces were also reasonable. I did enjoy the casava chips with herb and nut dipping sauce. Big hot wodges of chewy casava with a pleasing sauce. Food came out quickly and empty plates efficiently cleared up.So good overall, not amazing and a bit expensive as is usually the case with small plates (eg \u00a39 for two small lamb skewers) so the dishes need to stand out more than they did for the price.",

    "text": "Overall a yes, with a little hint of growing pains.My dining partner and I came in without a booking on a Sunday around 12:30. No booking? Sure, I guess we can sit at the bar. We were a bit close to the deep fryer (I like exposition kitchens), so it was a bit warm at first, but eventually I got used to the temperature and didn't notice it anymore. It is fun (though you feel a bit invasive almost) watching the cooks work, and I like feeling that the kitchen is a part of the dining experience. It is a lovely space in general, so no complaints there. We ordered: -Full Peruvian: Two fried eggs, confit pork chicharron, potato rosti, wild mushrooms, grilled tomato, avocado and toast-Omelet de Conchas y Setas: Scallop and wild mushroom omelette with sourdough toast-Cheeky Ceviche: Thinly sliced hake and cod cheeks in a Nikkei style tiger's milk with blood orange and spring onionThe Cheeky was awesome. I'd go back and just order that. Really, just a tasty dish. Tangy, great texture, unctuous fish cheeks... good stuff. The coffee was pretty good as well. Rob H.'s Full Peruvian looked and tasted pretty good. I was really envious of his avocado toast. \u00a0Mine was... blah. It was basically just a plain egg omelet (as in rolled egg) with a few mushrooms and baby scallops on top. With plain (though good quality) bread on the side. No colour, no butter, nothing on the toast at all... and its not like there was any sauce from the dish to mop up. Sure, those few scallop bites were sweet, but certainly not visually appealing nor worth the \u00a39, considering all Rob got for his \u00a310 with the Full Peruvian. It should have at least come with avocado toast like the other dish. I'm a fairly forgiving yelper, but I must say I was disappointed with my order.We had also ordered an order of the Yucas, but they never came, so we had to ask the waiter to take them off the bill, which he did promptly (but really, awkwardly and without apology... he tried to blame it on someone else or something, but really all you need to do is apologise). We were glad we didn't get them anyhow, because we were pretty full from everything else. In short, I will come back. And I hope to be writing a 5-star one next time based on how good that ceviche was.",

She told my friend off for not paying a deposit for uncompleted booking. Then mentioned paying a deposit several times (without mentioning how much the deposit is and what are the booking conditions). In her third email, she finally set a quote - we (as a group of 12) were required to have minimum spent \u00a3500. She wanted to force us into their set menu, which was even more expensive than having 3 courses from their standard menu. Using very unpleasant tone, never picking up the phone and never calling back. All the conversation was unnecessary spread into 3 days...Beware this lady in charge!",

    "text": "We came here for a lunch catch up with friends on their recommendation. \u00a0It was a good choice and we had a satisfying lunch. The restaurant describes itself as Peruvian tapas, so you should be ordering a number of dishes for the table and sharing. The overall experience has a 'Wahaca' feel to it. This really is an excellent way to catch up with friends and sample a variety of flavours and textures.They recommend three dishes per person, but we found that six dishes shared by three of us was plenty. My wife chose the Peruanazo full breakfast for herself as she was on a restricted diet. This had eggs, tacu-tacu with rice and butterbeans, belly bacon and saltado criollo (a kind of stir fry). She thought it was fine, but she didn't subsequently write home about it.The rest of us shared these dishes:Alas Sabogal: marinated fried chicken wingsSalm\u00f3n en Panca: salmon marinated in panca chilli, spinach, sweet potato mashPulpo Chanc\u00f3n: grilled octopusLengua de Arguedas: slow cooked ox tongueOne of the ceviches, which came with a wasabi mashThe pulled pork burger (a little hard to share, but not so bad if you deconstruct it first)These were good dishes and my favourite was the ox tongue. I am a fan of how tender the meat was.",

Great service and friendly manager and we'll all the food was amazing - I tried all the spicy ceviche and pork belly and wow how the flavours lingered. Being a foodie this has been one of my best experiences! I also took my 1 year old son who they were really good with! I can't wait to go back! YOU MUST CHECK OUT THIS PLACE!!!",

    "text": "I've had peruvian before and it had none of the flavors like here (or lack thereof). Maybe it's different region? Not sure...but my opinion is that the food tries way too hard to look contemporary and cool for the east side, that it forgets about flavor. Went there for brunch and ordered the poached egg with fish. It came out and it was TINY. I was so hungry and I didn't order off the tapas menu and I was so shocked I accidentally said out loud, \"That's it??\" This dish was tiny...I should of taken the picture to scale. Even though it was tiny, the presentation was nice and looked nice, and that went downhill after I tasted it. The fish had bones and smelled and tasted too fishy for the plate's combination. Took over the whole dish. Maybe cod would be better b/c it's less fishy and more meaty. No flavor popped out. All I can smell and taste was fish and the texture was fish bones. Even a squirt of lime would of helped in this dish that was crying for something..anything. I don't know the name of the other dish we ordered but you can see from my pictures. It was like a traditional English breakfast with some bread and guacamole....lacked taste as well.I didn't think the menu was impressive nor the food. The interior and decor is really nice, but I feel they are trying too hard. There's no focus on the food and flavors. It's all name and show of being Peruvian w/o the Peruvian authenticity from the food.",

    "text": "The only reason I hesitated giving this place 5 stars is because the bill adds up very quickly and not every dish is perfect. But, the ones that are will blow you out of the water and make you feel less bad for spending \u00a3100... for five drinks, 6 sides/dishes and 2 desserts. We arrived at our reserved time, and our table wasn't ready. So, they sat us at a little shelf-like table I'll call a bar. We ordered a couple of pisco sours (\u00a37.5 each), which were well presented and, if you like things that for some reason taste a bit like whiskey, you'll like these. But, if you were expecting something fruity like the descriptions seem to imply, you'll find the flavor is not quite like that. Either way, I drank my drink and noshed on some concha until our table was ready. Although service was friendly up until this point, we did get \"checked\" to see if we were truly on the reservation list while waiting at the bar--so sneaky folks, be advised, you need a reservation! The bar area is not for waiting without permission. We were soon moved downstairs, where it was super loud with talking and music, even more so than upstairs. But, we survived, yelling at each other across the table about how good the food was... From the Ceviche Classico to the Dulce con Cafe, we enjoyed [almost] every minute of our meal. The concha were good--nutty, corny, crunchy... a good way to start the meal (3.5 stars, \u00a32). The ceviche classico was absolutely to die for--the PERFECT mix of lime and spice and flavors that played so well together (5 stars, \u00a39). The ceviche andina on the other hand did not come in the awesomeness that is \"tiger's milk\", so it was rather bland and blah--not worth an additional \u00a38 (2 stars). But, we ate it anyway. The quinoa croquetas were also quite amazing--4 little balls of cheesy quinoa goodness with a surprisingly amazing spicy/sweet sauce for smearing (5 stars, \u00a33.5). The causa misti was a wonderfully fresh mix of veggies that complemented the rest of the dishes we'd eaten so far quite well (4.5 stars, \u00a36). We were getting palatably satiated at this point from the wondrous flavors, but then remembered we hadn't yet gotten our grilled dishes.. I don't know if they intentionally took longer to space things out, but just an FYI--you might wait a bit for your \"main\" dish. First came the bistec escabechado. This is supposed to be a fancified version of lomo saltado. My co-eater absolutely loved it with full expressions on his face showing his glory. I, on the other hand, was not very impressed with it. Maybe after all the lime, this meat and potatoes (and peppers) dish was just a bit blah to me--and oversalted. I guess they soak the meat in the pisco, but clearly also plenty of salt. Unless you don't mind a lot of salt and very little spice, I'd say you can skip this dish without regret (2.5 stars, \u00a313). Then came the salmon en panca. The salmon was the second most perfect I've ever eaten, with tons of flavor and just the right amount of seasoning, and it sat on a perfect little bed of spinach and had an interesting little smear of sweet potato to dress the plate (4.5 stars, \u00a310). The only thing I would say, however, is that the salmon wasn't at all \"exotic\" to me, so although it was good, I'd say you don't have to try it... (Stick to the ceviche, etc. instead.)At this point, my pisco sour, glass of wine and his two piscos and a beer were adding up in terms of quantity and price with the wonderful meal we were having to the point that the server recommended maybe we just share one dessert. But, we shared two--the dulce con cafe and the 3-scoops of ice cream/sorbet. The dulce was fantastic--like a fancy pudding with so many different--but talentedly separate--flavors to tease your tongue despite the journey it had already been through (5 stars, \u00a35.5). Can I just say how amazing it is that I could still taste that after all the lime and spice?! As for the ice cream/sorbet, I would say you can easily skip that. Our scoops included vanilla, cafe con leche and chili. Although they were all okay (2.5 stars, \u00a35), they were not really worth it... Too watery, and the cafe con leche was too milky to the point of blandness, the vanilla though tasty was too watery (more sorbet than ice cream for these scoops), and the chili was just too much chili and not enough wow (need more cream and depth of flavor). Bottom line: The prices are high for tapas, especially if you find your brain converting the \u00a3 to the $. But, the food is quite amazing if you order the right dishes--so venture in for at least one or two tapas just to try it out--my rec ceviche classico, causa misti and dulce con cafe (and skip the pisco sour; it's not that special nor worth \u00a37,5). And, then go get full elsewhere.",

    "text": "Andina is the sister restaurant of the famous Peruvian restaurant Ceviche, which unsurprisingly comprises of a number of ceviche dishes. It also is a pisco bar, pisco being a grape-based spirit from South America. So there are pisco cocktails aplenty. The food is tapas-style, so they recommend 2-3 plates per person. 2 dishes were plenty for me and left me room to try their dessert. I found of all the dishes I tried (those I ordered myself and bits I tried from friends) I found that the only real difference between them was the texture. Every dish had a strong, overpowering flavour of lime to the point where it was the only real flavour of the food. Having never had ceviche before, this may purely be my problems with ceviche and not of the restaurant itself, especially seeing as the lime is what \"cooks\" the food.The cocktails were pretty good, with a few different options for pisco delivery. There is also a Peruvian beer for those who are curious, which is very malty. So for those who love their beers malty (I guess there are some?) then make sure you grab one of these.tl;dr: Sour, acidic food that can be a bit samey, but on the whole a decent meal and with alcohol choices that are a little bit different to what you can find elsewhere!",

Tried about six dishes and the standouts for me were definitely the pulpo chanc\u00f3n (grilled octopus) and the tiradito de at\u00fan (seared tuna ceviche).

According to the clock, it was brunch time, and I wanted anything that didn't involve sausages and fried eggs. At 11:30, Andina was bustling. Groups of diners were flowing into and out of the restaurant, but luckily there was space at the bar for solo guests. Before I could begin processing what I might want to order from Andina's sprawling menu of Peruvian nibbles, ceviche and street food, I sat down and caffeinated myself. On my way in, I had passed the fresh juice bar, so I ordered the Ekeko, a sweet and unbelievably smooth blend of carrot, melon, pear, maca and ginger. It hit the spot. I followed up with a warm, aromatic quinoa-amaranth porridge topped with fresh berries and served with a side of purple corn syrup. This dish was grittier than traditional porridge, but it tasted luxurious (and filling). It didn't cure my jetlag, but I left Andina feeling well fed and glad that I stopped in.",

    "text": "One of my favorite restaurants while living in London and had always been meaning to write a review! My friend and I would normally resort to coming here whenever we felt like dining out. This place has great food, service and character!! It's pretty healthy and great for vegetarians given more than 50% of their dishes are vegetarian!! My favorite has been the quinoa burger along with yuca croquetas served over some spicy jam -- the place seems to bring a great balance of taste and healthiness to dining out. I would definitely recommend Andina if you're looking for some tasty and healthy South American food!!",

Our reservation was found immediately (pre-booking is critical) and we were led to a table in the front next to the bar. Although loud, the bar is a fun and lively place to sit and enjoy people watching. We ordered a variety of dishes which included nibbles, 2 ceviches (Andina and Yana), very very strong black olives (you are hereby warned), corn cakes (scrumptious), an eggplant dish, the sublime pork belly and a few other incredible plates. The 11yo ordered a smoothie to drink, which she promptly knocked over. An amazing ballet ensued, where 3 members of staff rushed to our aide. 1 cleaned the table, 1 cleaned the floor, and 1 chased me down as I ran to the ladies to offer handbag cleaning services. Amazing! And to top it off, the same handbag cleaning gent assured my daughter that he had also had a clumsy night with smoothies, resulting in donning his 3rd clean shirt for the evening! He did a wonderful job making her feel better and we were back to normal in no time. Pisco sours are a must and I also had a beautiful glass of wine. For afters, we shared a platter of pumpkin doughnuts with the most delicious port-style dipping sauce, while the daughter had a stunning passion fruit cake. We LOVE LOVE LOVE Andina. You must go there.",

It is definitely less crowded, too!Though I normally don't drink cocktails, I decided to go for it and try a tamaya pisco. It was quite sweet so not really what I like, but I think if you did like cocktails any pisco from their menu would be great.I ordered the palm hearts salad, grilled octopus, and shared the dulce con cafe (dessert). All were very delicious, but I particularly liked the octopus and the dessert. Hubs got the chicken from the grill and really enjoyed that, which made me guess that most items from the grill selection would be tasty!We were so full we nearly didn't order dessert, but the waiter highly recommended the dulce con cafe so we gave it a try, and we were glad we did! Such a wonderful way to finish off a lovely meal.",

While waiting we ordered some smoothies. Both of the flavors we tried were delicious and gone before we even got a table. As for the food, we ordered about 2 dishes to share among the four of us, which was plenty. \u00a0My favorite was the tuna in tigers milk dish, although I loved almost all of them. A few of the dishes were surprisingly spicy, but pleasantly so. For dessert we had the doughnuts, which were perfectly warm and delightful! Our waiter was very energetic and friendly, and our food came extremely quickly. The restaurant was very busy, and a bit loud at times, but we enjoyed the lively music and atmosphere.Would love to come back to Andina!",

However, this is the one that we have come back to and it is because she says its exciting modern takes on Peruvian food but still sticks to the foundations of traditional Peruvian cusine. The Cerviches are the trademark dishes here and there is a great selection of different seafoods to go for which makes it more interesting than the boring standard white fish cerviches you get in other Peruvian places. I think the best dishes here are the Anticuchos and the Chicken skewers. They have been marinated and grilled so well that you can really taste the flavours blend with the soft meat in your mouthAtmosphere is great! Good music (the owner has his own Peruvian record label) and amazing jazzy art on the wallsI have not given this 5 stars as I dont think the drinks are that good and are just gimmicky. They flavour the piscos but its just a different syrup that they add each time. They also did nothing for \"National Pisco day\" at all!...so they slearly concentrate on their foodAwesome and unique place however!",

Having tried Andina last week, it is now in my top three, and if it is this consistent on future visits, could even claim #1. Their 'full english' equivalent is some kind of pork belly offering, perfectly fried eggs, grilled tomatoes, lovely thin mushrooms (not the soggy English breakfast style) topped off with a side serving of avocado on sourdough toast. Mmmmmm. Their fresh juice and smoothy selection is also excellent. Just don't make the mistake my colleague made of ordering the quinoa porridge - she ended up being very jealous.So a great breakfast overall. \u00a0I plan to go back for lunch or dinner soon.",

Not that I have any hatred for it, I just don't seek it out. Anyhoo, credit must be given to the inviting look of the place thru the windows for convincing me to give this place a try. The interior is indeed cozy, clean, modern / rustic (the look of all the new architecture in Shoreditch, but lighter and less assuming), just had a good vibe overall. Staff was friendly and welcoming too.Well I'm so glad I stopped in - not once, but twice. It just became my go-to place when I wanted local lunch.Had the Green bean mixed salad both days. It's hard to find a good salad anywhere, and this one was simple, light and satisfying. When you can integrate radicchio and make it taste great, you get props from me.On one day I had the Quinoa Burger (w/ Kiwi Yogurt and Chili Mayo), and it was fine. It didn't really hold together as a patty, but it all tasted good. They get points for at least attempting a burger made out of Quinoa.The next day I had the Trout skewers in rocoto pepper, which was super-tasty. Fish was cooked perfectly.I really enjoyed the place overall, the finest lunch dining I had in London, and I was in town for two weeks.",

Unless you have visited or ate the cuisine you would never associate such a vibrant, exotic, rich and diverse place with such simplistic nutritious subtle food. Andina in Shoreditch is the second restaurant from Martin Morales, (Ceviche in Soho being the first with a third restaurant opening in Old Street in 2015). \u00a0The food is exactly how I like it, to share. It is reminiscent of house dinners with the family. Plates of goodness arriving at the table, arms reaching across to spoon portions, sighs of fulfillment and chatter as a background soundtrack.The food is awesome. We had Mario Florian Tiradito, purple grazetiradito, beef steak, red & white quinoa, avocado and cucumber salad, lamb and many more plates. For 3 of us, we ordered 3 items each which was suggested by the waitress. Good call - as everything is so tasty, you want everything. The food really lights up your taste buds with some dishes working the zest. Service was seamless and in saving the best for the last, their \"Macaroni Cheese\" (Huancaina Macaroni) is literally food porn. Tasty, filling and dangerously tempting to order a second. When I returned to the office, I wished I was in a country which allowed for a siesta, as I really needed to recover from effects of this food extravaganza. Highly recommended, definitely worth it.",

But now they're back. And it's their cuisine they are asking us to fall in love with. It seems to be working. Everyone banging on about it. Time to get involved. Andina.In the heart of Shoreditch.Helpful, passionate staff.Comfy surroundings.Everyone raving about the place.Top lunchmates.Ex boss paying.What's not to like?Unfortunately, the food.It's not that it's executed badly. The dishes seemed to be made with love and care and passion.It's just - slightly nervous typing this - I'm not sure Peruvian food is that nice.Ceviche came with good meaty morsels of raw fish which I happily chomped through. But there's enough salt in the dish to make you wonder whether, served in any other guise, we'd spit it out and declare it poisonous.The quinoa dish looked beautiful. Like an amazing multi coloured sand sculpture. It tasted like that too. Pork belly in a bun was clumsy. The pork belly was incinerated. To my mind cuts like pork belly need time and patience. This dish was given neither and the morsels were presented on a needless hamburger bun and some sort of mayo that floated around and nobody ate.The scallops were delicious but there was a load of other stuff on the plate with it which confused matters. This was a general theme. Lots of different things on each plate. None of them particularly enhancing the main event. It looked pretty but it tasted a bit all over the place.Each dish that came out was interesting. But when you're describing something as interesting, bottom line is you're not really loving it.Best dish we had was the prawn and squid bisque. It tasted just like something from a lovely local Basque cafe. And it made me wonder if the truth is I just don't really like Peruvian food. The nicest thing I ate was straight out of the Med.We have a lot to thank Peru for. The Andes. Illicit drugs. Paddington bear. They can be happy with their contribution without foisting their grub on us thanks very much.",

Consistently bland and boring despite ambitious descriptions.Artichoke Tamal was terrible - vinegary, canned-tasting, stringy artichoke in very little masaThe Bistec Escabochado was good - but maybe 3 oz total. It was very mild-flavored beef, with a slightly vinegary salsa that worked, but wasn't exciting.The Cherna, or chili-marinated Stone Bass was also nicely cooked, but I drenched each bite in the sauce to get a hint of heat.We were going to order the Chullo Salad, until we saw it arrive at the seat next to us - it looked like plain wedges of beets and orange. Instead, we got the Causa Huanuco. While it tasted decent, and the dry powdered beets were fun to scrape off the plate, I wondered \"Why is it cold? Why are the beets crunchy? Where's the seaweed? What is this other green stuff?\" I checked the menu/placemat - it was a flavorless avocado crema.The Jocote, whipped up quickly in a blender, was nicely frothy with egg white, with a light gin flavor. Like the food, it wasn't particularly strong or complex. Unlike the food, it was tasty.\u00a325 each later, we left hungry.",

    "text": "Arriving to Andina, I stated we had a booking and was moved to a 4 person table only to be told 5 minutes later that they'd thought we were a three and then asked for my reservation and we were moved to another table. We ordered some food, we had to take cutlery from another table as we didn't have it on ours. My husband's huevos picante arrived. It was fine but the sauce was a little bland. 20 minutes later my food had not arrived and neither had my husband's tea. We asked a waiter about the delay and he said he would check although he wasn't particularly apologetic. My husband made an error in asking for my meal that had scrambled eggs which I corrected and said I had poached. Soon after we received tea and sourdough with scrambled eggs so clearly my order hadn't been taken in the first place. I pointed out that the order was wrong and the waitress who I think was the manager offered to take it back but my husband had well finished his food by then and I wanted to leave. She didn't say sorry. After some more slow service we received the bill with a service charge which we asked to be removed which took another 10 - 15 minutes. The restaurant wasn't particularly busy and there were more staff than customers. Finally at that point we had an apology though not from the person who messed up our order. Normally I don't really comment on the service as the food is more important but in this case it made it a very unpleasant experience and actually the food was pretty average and expensive for what it was. Won't be going back.",

And I leave happy every time! \u00a0 Recently for brunch we tried the Huevos Q'apachana, two poached eggs, spicy potato puree, spinach, chestnut mushrooms, Huancaina sauce. This is the perfect brunch dish. The puree is silky smooth, and the mushrooms are delicious. I am obsessed with Huancaina sauce after my travels in Peru. And Andina has Huancaina sauce in dishes all over the menu...they get it.I tried the Chicharron Sandwich - confit pork belly, soft bun, camote ketchup. Absolute comfort food. The pork belly was so tender, and the camote ketchup delicious.My friend really enjoyed the Picante de Huevos, as recommended by our waiter. This did not disappoint, especially with a tamal! \u00a0 From the lunch/dinner menu, I cannot recommend the corn cake & avocado enough - I could eat this every day. Once you taste it, you will know why.It is difficult to fault any dish on Andina's menu. Each one has different textures, and loads of flavour.Great cocktails and smoothies. Get a pisco sour! The only negative thing I have to say is that the chefs LOVE to top every dish with a mountain of raw red onion, which I really dislike so have to take off every time. I must try to remember to ask the waiter to exclude the mountain next time.",

The menu left me in a tizz trying to decide what I wanted, it just all looked, sounded and smelled so good! Open kitchen next to the seating means you can observe the chefs as they put the plates together and is certainly a cause to wet your appetite! Gorgeous brunch grub with a (you guessed it) Peruvian twist - coriander mayonnaise, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and spinach with whole roasted garlic, eggs poached to pure perfection! This was also my first try of a Pisqo Sour (Amazing - recently recommened in TimeOut as one of the best places to go for one and I would absolutely second that) and Quinoa milk latte (They don't serve soya so this was the alternative - Double amazing). Flavoursome and beautifully presented (it took all my willpower not to pocket the kitsch earthenware cup my espresso was delivered in) - I highly recommend a taste! Cosy, warm environment, friendly prompt staff - the perfect venue to fuel up for the day with friends before a trip around Spitalfields or a day of photography around the well graffitied streets of Shoreditch.",

I'd booked ahead on a Saturday at midday and it was a good job I did, as both the ground level and brightly lit lower level were heaving with hungry hipsters.We were seated downstairs by the friendly front of house, and our waiter immediately struck up some friendly banter which happily continued through the meal without feeling forced. He was particularly amused (as was I) with how quickly we both dysoned our food - it arrived at superspeed so we'd only been there about half an hour and already finished eating!Food envy struck at the Full Peruvian breakfast my mate devoured, though my tastebuds were firing in all the right places with the poached egg and corn cake, served with avo, onion and some lovely spicy salsa and huancaina sauce. Mmm a really great blend of flavours altogether and over far too soon - I could have had another right after it.Luckily they weren't in a hurry to get rid of us, so we happily lingered to enjoy the lively music and some fresh juices (I had the ekeko mix of carrot, melon, maca and ginger and felt great!) followed by coffees. I'm not sure if it all stemmed from the friendly service but there is a real warm, happy feel to the place. The only reason it loses a star is being quite pricey for what it is, but much like others in the ever-popular Shoreditch brunch line-up, it frankly doesn't need to give a damn. It might be a good thing actually, else I'd be here for brekkie every day!Bonus toilet tip: yep the sink area is unisex, but the individual cubicles do have Ms and Fs on, which not everyone seemed to have spotted...",

After several cups of their own special Peruvian blend coffee (JOLT!), a bowl of quinoa porridge with fresh fruit syrups/summer fruits, and some sourdough toast with avocado and scrambled eggs we were fighting fit to take on the day. Quite delightful, actually. The service was great on a morning midweek. They have a lot more seating downstairs so if the top looks jammed, don't fret...do see the host. They also do a lot of things to takeaway including fresh squeezed juices. See the bar and get yours to go if in a rush. Andina -- now added to my Shoreditch breakfast options! Peruvian-style.",

My first brunch was good (and I thought a better dining experience than their sister restaurant Ceviche in Soho) but this past visit and dessert was truly delicious. For a drink, my girlfriend and I decided to go non alcoholic and both had Fuerza a mix of quinoa, apple, cinnamon, milk, maca. The server warned us ahead of time that the drink is quite thick and can be a 'meal' in and of itself. It was really delicious (if you dont' like your drinks too sweet) and part of me wanted to grab the recipe to have something healthy to warm up next to a fire with! \u00a0For dessert, the Picarones Doughnuts which came with icecream and two dips. I can't recommend this highly enough - if you like melt in your mouth donuts - this is the place to go and the meal to try. I keep dreaming about these and can't wait to bring friends in town visiting when I show them around Shoreditch.The only con both times has been the service - both times i've been here I've found the hostess' to be quite abrupt - I'm sure it is difficult to figure out seating (especially for walk-ins) but both times I haven't felt quite welcomed upon arrival. That being said, once seated the servers have always been very friendly!",

A group of 3 of us went on a Wednesday evening at 8pm and had to wait 30 minutes for a seat at the shared tables so it gets quite busy - advise booking!The place is pretty big, although it doesn't seem it when you first walk in. There are 10 or so small tables for 2-4, a small bar and a restaurant are where I think they finish prep. Around the back on the same floor is a room with 2 large tables which are the shared tables although would also be perfect for large groups. This space is nice and light as it has a glass roof. On the floor below is plenty more seating for small to medium size groups. In all plenty of seating and I was very surprised at how long we had to wait to be seated - it must be popular!We waited at the small bar and ordered a cocktail each (all pisco based) - I can highly recommend the cucumber and apple cocktail; very refreshing!When we were sat at the shared table we were round a corner so we were able to talk quite easily and also as we were sharing everything it was easier to share than in a line of 3! We had had ages to look and the menu and decided on the quinoa croquetas, duck ceviche, chicken casserole, cassava chips, slow cooked ox tongue and sweet potato salad. Everything comes out as ready so we have 2 plates, then a further 3. Unfortunately our salad didn't come before we had finished everything else so we cancelled as we didn't fancy it on it's own. Everything was good but some things were FANTASTIC (ox tongue, duck and cassave chips). The other things I probably wouldn't order again.Cannot wait to come back as there was plenty on the menu I wanted to try (especially as I wasn't sure I would enjoy the ceviche). Pudding menu also looked fab but we weren't hungry enough. Looks good for brunch/ breakfast as well!",

They peruvian food is delicate and flavorsome.The staff are attentive, bringing us a range of small plates at precisely the right times. This nibbling style of eating is delightful, each dish providing a new delight to the eyes as well as the taste buds.The cuisine provided here is fun and intriguing, their aren't many peruvian places around and certainly not so well executed.From the people who brought us Ceviche this restuarant has a similar vibe, not so loud and noisey but still buzzing with conversation. A GREAT place for a date. \u00a0Ceviche is indeed on the menu but this is only part of the offering.I'd highly reccomend it.On a side note they have a whole Vegan menu, my date was eating only vegan food and could not rave enough about how delicious it was. So a truly great option for those with specific dietary requirements.",

The food was at the same time authentic to that we had in Peru and yet better than we had in our travels there. Great Peruvian drinks based on Pisco as well.",

    "text": "Fantastic flavours but service really struggles here when it's busy as we experienced a few Sundays ago for brunch. It took a server a while to come to our table and even then basic requests such as tap water kept having to get repeated. Anyway onto the food: I got the braised aubergine, quinoa tacu tacu patty and crumbled feta to start. Simply phenomenal textures and flavour combinations, with a mole-like sauce on the aubergine and the slight crunch of the patty blending well. The feta really was the icing on the cake. I also ordered the corn tamal, kale pesto and cancha corn but the waiter got the wrong order and brought me the pork tamale instead. Anyway this was soon rectified by another waitress (who couldn't seem to distinguish between veg and vegan but no matter!) and my meal arrived readily. Again it was a phenomenal mix of flavours! My companions got the black rice and mango salad and that earned my high praise. My husband got the avocado pancakes and I even raved about them: they were sweet and fluffy and tasted nothing like avo. It's not the cheapest brunch but not the most expensive. I would return here just know you're not going to get the best service.",

    "text": "I've been excited to come here because of all the great reviews! We finally made the trip and were surprisingly seated right away. There are two floors, a very relaxing yet romantic atmosphere, and dim lighting with a rustic vibe. Service started off average then turned out to be awful. My niece asked the waitress to take back the shrimp because she tasted it \u00a0and found it tasteless and hard to eat. You literally get little pieces of the shell left over in your mouth which is why I said it's hard to eat. The waitress asked if she liked it to which my niece replied \"no\" but wasn't offered anything to replace it. We just found that weird because if you know your customer is unhappy with what they received, typically the waiter is supposed to ask them if they would like to order anything else.To drink I got an Americano coffee which was your average American cup of coffee. But anyways, to eat I also got the shrimp which I also found tasteless but as I was starving I ate them anyway. I also got the torrejas de pl\u00e1tano which was so good! Whatever the cream stuff was it came with was super satisfying and really complimented the pl\u00e1tano. The last thing I got was the tacu tacu which is basically braised eggplant but OMG it was the best eggplant I've ever tasted! My niece also got this and she's not a fan of eggplant but found this dish very delicious. Lastly, my niece got the chips (fries) with huancaina sauce which was nothing special, just average. For dessert we got the doughnuts which were god awful! A manager came by and asked if everything was ok and my niece asked if there was supposed to be a filling inside which he replied \"no\" to. She asked this because the doughnuts were definitely undercooked. There was clearly raw batter inside so the manager apologized and took it away. Apart from the manager coming around from table to table to ask how everything was going, the waitress never asked how we were doing or if I wanted another coffee. Our major problem here was that my niece ate two pieces of shrimp yet was charged for it and when she asked the waitress about this she's like how it was halfway eaten which it wasn't. However, the doughnuts we ordered (which were actually halfway eaten) we weren't charged for so I don't really understand her logic. We didn't want to argue she argued to pay for this. When the bill finally came the shrimp was off of it, so, again, I don't understand why they were going to make her pay if the second time around the shrimp wasn't on the bill.I also don't see the point in the waitress asking if she liked the shrimp if she wasn't going to do anything about it -- makes no sense! Also, as a manager, when there's a customer complaint they typically come back around more than once but after that initial visit, he didn't check on us nor did he seem to care that our experience wasn't a good one. I'm really not a complainer but coming as a visitor from one developed country to another, you expect a certain level of service which definitely was not fulfilled at Aldina. We travelled 30 minutes by bus in the pouring rain to get here because of all the great reviews but unfortunately we didn't have the same positive experience the majority has seemed to have had here. I typically never rate this low but after the treatment we received, I couldn't give a good rating, regardless of the fact overallI enjoyed my food. I just wish that establishments could understand that service is just as important as the food being served and can make or break a situation. There are times I can recall where I've been to a restaurant where I didn't necessarily enjoy the food but gave a good rating because of the amazing service and actually went back to try something different on the menu. This goes to show that as a consumer we don't just pay for food but service as well. Time to step it up!",

Unfortunately, I am only able to review on the breakfast as I didn't have enough time to eat lunch, dinner or their weekend brunch menu (my only complaint is that I wish they provided this menu all days of the week-sad I only stumbled on this on weekday and left before weekend). For beverages:-Fuerza: a must order hot drink!! Made with quinoa, Apple, cinnamon, milk and moca, this milky creamy latte consistency \u00a0of a drink gave me the feels.-Hot Emoliente: another must order hot drink. If you're not feeling anything milky, I suggest ordering this. Barley, linseed, alfalfa and quince. Can't get anymore healthy than this. Weekday breakfast items:-pudding de Maiz (corn souffl\u00e9 with slice of bacon, smeared avocado pur\u00e9e with the perfect poached egg)-sweet potato pancakes: I mean ,come on!! So good-chia seed pudding. Holy moly. Will blow your mind away With a cookbook of their own, you know that Andina doesn't mess around. Get your tushy over here NOW.",

It was my birthday, and the first restaurant my friend, grandmother and I visited had a 1.5 hr wait, so after some searching, we stumbled on Andina. The hostess and manager worked with us and we were able to get a table. My waiter was really friendly, and when another waiter found out that it was my birthday, he really went above and beyond. He got me a spicy drink on the house, and had the entire restaurant sing happy birthday to me! Certainly as night to remember",

    "text": "Good old-fashioned Peruvian food with a modern, and dare I say, deliciously-healthy twist. The prices may be a little steep for some people looking for a simple breakfast or brunch, but the quality is worth it, and really, check out the area this place is in. It's like the up-and-coming Arts District of London. It is usually packed, but if there aren't too many in your group, you may be able to snag a table downstairs. Now, down to the food. Their brunch items are super popular here, and with good reason. The fare is heavy in South American favorites like purple corn, quinoa, sweet potato, exotic fruits, cassava, and other such healthy-for-you starchy goodness. Their Sweet Potato Pancakes with Spiced Chancaca Honey, Coconut Whipped Cream, Seasonal Fruit, and Dried Physalis is a decadent way to start your day while still feeling like you're doing something good for your body. Sort of.The rest of their menu items vary from the sweet to the savory, light to the hearty, and everything in between. They also make superfood smoothies and juices in house, and while not cheap, you may be able to use one as a quick meal replacement that may keep you satiated for a few hours. And if you love starting your day with booze, they offer some high-quality options of that, too.",

I actually took someone here, thought I'd impress them, granted it was an expensive night, but food was worth it. Funny story, I asked for the bill, went to the loo and when I got back my date had paid for the whole thing!?!? Felt like I owed her one, sure I've paid it all back by now with food and wine. Anyway...I've just gone on and written a mini story/essay.8/10 for ceviche. There are two other places for ceviche nearby (kinda), one called 'ceviche' in old st and another in Kingly Court (can't remember the name of this place, also not actually that close). Andina beats them on the quality of food imho, but can seem a bit pricy.",

The octopus was finger licking good, we had a cold fish starter that I can't remember the name of - OMG, so flavoursome! They also have corn for nibbles- popcorn but not popped and yum!

    "text": "*Brunch Review*I definitely couldn't fail to be excited by the prospect of a Peruvian breakfast. \u00a0Andina is part of the Ceviche stable (founded by Martin Morales), so I expected some pretty good things. \u00a0As Katie B mentions, we got a spot overlooking the kitchen without a booking at 12:30 on a Sunday. \u00a0Just my sort of spot, especially seeing as we got to watch pork being deep fried, batch after batch. \u00a0The staff were pretty friendly towards us (unlike some of the other reviewers' experiences) which is also a plus.Starting off, we ordered a Chambi juice (cucumber, grapefruit, pear, and ginger) and coffees. \u00a0The juice wasn't sweet at all, but very refreshing - some may find it a bit bitter, but I liked it. \u00a0It was garnished with some gooood slices of pear too. \u00a0The coffee (Italian style) is not bad either.For dishes, we ordered a Cheeky Ceviche, some cassava fries (which never materialised - probably a good thing as I did end up pretty full without), an omelet de Conchas, and a full Peruvian. \u00a0The ceviche was excellent. \u00a0the fish cheek gives the dish a much different texture than I've come to expect...I think they're also slightly stronger tasting as well. \u00a0The blood orange went really well with it too. \u00a0I expected great ceviche and we got it.The rest of the mains...aiya. \u00a0Katie has summed up hers pretty well. \u00a0My Full Peruvian...full marks for the deep fried pork chicharrons (jn a tasty tomatoey type sauce) which were excellent. \u00a0The avocado on toast was also pretty good. \u00a0Everything else was, well, quite frankly insipid which was highly disappointing. \u00a0The eggs/tomato/mushroom were pretty standard. \u00a0The potato rosti wasn't good at all. \u00a0I spent a lot of time as an Undergraduate making potato rostis, and this paled in comparison...the inside seemed undercooked, the outside wasn't crispy, and it had a kind of frozen potato taste (don't get me wrong, I love my potato waffles, but this wasn't very pleasant). \u00a0Generally, I love the twisted Full Englishes I've tried at various brunch places - Franze and Evans' Italian-style one, or Koya's Full English Udon. \u00a0In that regard, this one was utterly disappointing. \u00a0Except for the pork, \u00a0Give me the pork any day.I really want to like Andina, and I will probably give it a second chance at some point. \u00a0Still, at this point, it's difficult to justify brunching there considering that the excellent Franze & Evans and Dishoom are in the immediate vicinity. \u00a0Unless I'm in a particularly fishy mood, it won't take me much to overlook this one. \u00a0I had a similar feeling after eating at Ceviche (although the quality of the mains there was way better than those here) - excellent ceviche, but just not enough outside of that, and a hint of style over substance. \u00a0Still, there's potential here if they do take things on board.",

The atmosphere is friendly and the main downstairs dining area was well lit with good Latin music playing. Our waiter was extremely helpful and recommended several dishes to us Peruvian foodie first timers, even bringing us a shot of one of the marinades to try out. We were advised to have between 3 and 4 dishes to share (go for 4 as the portions are not huge) and were left feeling perfectly full.The sea bass ceviche was absolutely delicious and beautifully flavoured with watermelon, strawberries, and a very spicy 'tiger milk' sauce. The chicken and avocado cacos was quite small and with a delicate flavour easily drowned out by the other dishes but thankfully it came first and we were able to enjoy it, along with some really great, if slightly bland, lamb skewers. They also make excellent chips which were perfect for soaking up the tiger milk. All the food was between about \u00a36 and \u00a310 per dish which for portion size is sometimes a little steep. However tapas-style dining is always enjoyable and all in all the experience was delicious and I will certainly be going back to explore more Peruvian cuisine!",

    "text": "I absolutely LOVED Andina. Came here with my dad, we were staying at an Airbnb in shoreditch and our host recommended this place.We arrived around 9pm on a Friday night. There were no available tables, but the hostess actually called people who had reservations to see if there were any cancellations, and one person cancelled, so she sat us right away!We ordered 6 dishes to share between the two of us, as our server recommended. Everything we had was absolutely amazing. The classic ceviche was incredibly tasty and fresh. We ordered the salmon and lamb chop for our main two dishes, both were flavorful, well cooked and presented beautifully. We also had a wonderful Spanish wine recommended to us by our server.The service, food and ambiance all exceeded my expectations. The food is a bit pricy, I think our bill came out to around 70 pounds for the 2 of us, but well worth it for a special occasion or nice date out. Would highly recommend.",

    "text": "Managed to get a walk in table for two early evening. Although we were sat downstairs (upstairs in nicer) we were quite happy to get a table as it was busy. Lovely decor and feel to the place and very attentive service. Our waiter talked us through the menu (we found it quite amusing as he recommended everything) and insisted we ordered a pisco sour to start with. So we did! We ordered five dishes (six we advised) including the must have ceviche Andina, a baked chicken casserole and some quinoa salads and sides. All were delicious, well flavoured and really enjoyable. Paid \u00a352 for five dishes and two drinks which we were quite happy paying as we felt it was worth it. Unusual and tasty Peruvian cuisine, excellent service and a great setting. Would like to go for brunch next time as it's supposed to be good.",

    "text": "A Peruvian restaurant that just opened in Shoreditch. I went there for Sunday brunch once and it is instantly my favorite restaurant. It is not a big restaurant and looks quite unassuming from the outside. I wasn't sure what to expect, I decided to go for brunch as a low risk first try. The brunch menu was very creative and everything sounded very appetizing. My friend and I settled on one sweet and one savory dish: Omelet with scallop and wild mushroom and corn cake. The corn cake was made from corn and gueso fresco, creamy with natural sweetness from the corn. I loved it. As we were eating we had serious food envy, so we ordered a ceviche to try. The waiter recommended the seabass ceviche which was another highlight of the meal. I would have ordered a different type of ceviche if I were not about to burst. I am so thrilled to have a great place for ceviche right in my neighborhood. Can't wait to go back for dinner! Highly recommend it, and if you do go, don't forget to make reservations, it gets really busy here.",

Busy busy on weekends, make sure you arrive not too late or make a reservation first! Wonderful dinner and I totally recommend to everyone!",
