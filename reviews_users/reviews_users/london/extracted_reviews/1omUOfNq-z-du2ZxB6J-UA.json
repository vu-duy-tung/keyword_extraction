    "text": "I love Carluccios, especially this one. I went here today for lunch and it was so nice. I got the Penne Giardiniera which was \u00a37.25 and a total bargain for the quality of the food. It had courgettes, chilli, and deep fried spinach balls with parmesan and garlic. It wasn't a big portion but I wasn't that hungry so I didn't mind. The food was delicious though and with that particular dish they donate 50p to the Action against hunger charity which makes it taste all the sweeter. The building is beautiful too, upstairs is the private dining room and the ground floor has the lovely food shop and the cafe. My friend got a sandwich with mozzarella, pesto and tomato and although it seems really simple it came out on in a massive triangular ciabatta and I had a bite and it was gorgeous, and completely huge.The waiting staff were lovely, all very smiley and from what I could tell all Italian. Another friend told me that she didn't have a good experience there with the service but I don't believe her, Its always a great meal in Carluccios.",

    "text": "I do love a bit of Carluccio's, firstly because it reminds me of my parents, they love having coffee there back in Reading and secondly, well because the food is good, Italian and I love Italian.Because it is not the cheapest chain restaurant out there, I tend to only go for a special occaision or if my mum takes me. I always have the pasta and fried spinach balls- they are something special and a bit of the money goes to charity. The steak is not their best option, but the pasta is always good. Look at the specials. The sandwiches soups and foccacias are also amazing, the bread they serve you is delicious, but I say if you are already there, then just go all out on a meal. You might aswell. The coffee of course is amazing, as is the thick hot chocolote, nothing like the powder stuff. And for pudding you can't go wrong with the gelato, or the tiramisu... or anything really!This Carluccios is my favourite location wise, but there are lots of them dotted around the city- the chain seems to be doing well and is expanding rapidly. They also sell pasteries, cheeses, wines, ready made meals and anti pasti to go.",

Yes they are busy, our server actually said they were 'always this busy', but they just cannot cope with the number of covers!! There are always several 'managers' wandering around doing nothing, the four tables where we were sitting were all badly served, we waited an age for starters (basically toasted bread with differing sides) and when they eventually arrived one was wrong!! (Not rocket science guys!!!), and our mains were brought by before the correct starter had managed to get to the table!! No proper apology for this, no drinks offered, we ended up eating out starters separately and then waited again for our mains as fresh ones had to be cooked!! The tables around us waited for drinks, food and coffees. I like Carluccios as a chain, but avoid this one at all costs, plenty of other places close by that offer good food and an acceptable level of service.",

Slightly on the pricey side, at least the menu is not off the shelf Italian and you can be assured of good quality food. The deserts and coffee especially are exceptional (but then, I have a sweet tooth!). The crowd is funky and vibrant and not-too-touristy, whih makes a change for Covent Garden. Definitely worth a visit if you want a quick meal - be sure to book during busy times as it gets full!",

So I can tell you that the staff at Carluccio's are completely trained - they had a week's worth with maps of Italy and everything! The food at Carluccio's is delicious. Whether you sit down and eat or you choose something from their deli. Their prices are reasonable and you know you're getting good ingredients. This is a large Carluccio's with the bottom floor arranged in tables and booths on the side. Upstairs is pretty similar but with better and ofter lighting. I highly recommend a meal here. But a word of warning, book on a Friday at lunch time because it gets very full.",

    "text": "Carluccios is one of the great successes of the chain world. An amazing feat when you consider how very average its food is. I blame those clever marketeers who have correctly surmised that if you display some authentic-looking deli bits and bobs at the front of the restaurants, chuck in some shelves of ludicrously over-priced but exquisitely packaged italian biscuits, spaghetti and the like, that diners will somehow fail to notice its less-than-exquisite dining experience.The other night at the Earlsfield branch my friend and I ordered a milanese risotto.As someone who has lived in Italy, I know that if nothing else there should be a smattering of saffron in this.Ma non. Instead we received white, cold slop in which a few gobbits of salsiccia bobbed mournfully. As for flavour..seasoning..garnish, there was none. It wouldn't have looked out of place on a school dinner menu (pre-Jamie Oliver style makeover). When I asked the waitress where the saffron was she looked blank and shrugged, saying: this is the chef's version. Rather like putting roast chicken on the menu and serving up a poached pear instead. Anyway, she was apologetic and - between bouts of listening to a neighbouring table's gripes about their meal - invited us to choose something else on the menu. This we duly did. When the bill came we found we'd been charged both for our second choices (and for one of the milanese risottos).Molto molto disappointing.",

    "text": "I recently attended a Planeta wine tasting in the private dining room at Carluccio's and I was very much impressed with the venue, the food and (especially) the wines and the uber-knowledgeable and enthusiastic sommelier/presenter for the evening. The Planeta wines (Sicilian whites, reds and a dessert wine) and the Planeta olive oil were delicious. I wanted to be critical of the wines - or, I should say, I expected to be - but I really couldn't find fault with them. Delicious wines and a good value (ranged from a tenner to less than 20) that I will certainly be buying in the future. The olive oil was fruity and fresh with no bitterness. A tad on the expensive size (\u00a314 for a small bottle), but if your wallet permits, then it's a great choice. The venue was stylish, yet warm and inviting. The tasting was held in the private dining room, which is on the second floor of Carluccio's and overlooks the buzzy streets. It was a perfect setting and I'd love to have an excuse to organise something there again (or suggest it to someone who is looking for a private dining room). The antipasti (vegetarian and non) were delicious and super fresh (salame, porchetta, artichokes, olives, killer caponata, Sicilian-style cous cous and more). The small cannoli served with the dessert wine were very good and had fresh candied orange peel - something one doesn't usually find in cannoli outside of certain areas in Italy. Kudos (and a big thank you) to Mike for being so knowledgeable and infectiously enthusiastic about Planeta wines, whilst being relaxed and affable and making everyone feel right at home.",

Not only did they serve us up some tasty treats from the kitchen (including home made cannoli,which was delicious as was the Planeta dessert wine) but the wine was also excellent. I especially liked the rose and the whites. If you are eating at Carluccios, don't miss one of the Planeta wines. If you're on your way to a dinner party - pop into a Carluccios cafe and buy a bottle of Planeta to bring along. You won't go wrong.",

    "text": "Three years after the last review, its probably time for an update. Or a confirmation that standards at the Covent Garden Carluccio's have fallen since the heady days or 4- and 5-star reviews.We were going to the ballet and wanted a nice, simple dinner beforehand. We chose Carluccio's because we thought we could rely on a chain with a strong reputation; we'd both enjoyed good food in other branches and were looking forward to the meal.We went for the Fixed Price menu as it included items from the main menu that we would have chosen anyway. But it seems the bargain price of the Fixed Menu (\u00a312-\u00a313 for three courses) doesn't buy you quality. The bruschetta starter \u00a0who would have thought an Italian restaurant could make a bad bruschetta! \u00a0was cold and the super tough piece of toast didn't even have a full topping. Only half the slice was covered with tomato mix, the rest with cheap salad leaves!We both chose ravioli for the mains. The (apprx) six pieces of stodgy, tasteless pasta had the meanest filling (not truffle or venison, but spinach and ricotta, so I'm not sure why the stinginess). This was served with the most watery, flavourless sauce ever. Sure, it was a butter sauce, which is usually a subtle flavour, but you should never have to drown a sauce with parmesan and pepper just to make it palatable. Even after that, I couldn't bring myself to eat it.In all fairness the staff were very responsive, which is why the review has two stars: When the waitress came to check if we were enjoying our meal, I bluntly told her the pasta was horrible. I was going to leave it at that; we didn't want to bother complaining as we didn't want to spoil the rest of the evening. But the waitress obviously passed on the comment to her manager, who came over to us. He was very friendly and pleasant, and I stressed we didn't want to make a complaint and I wasn't looking to try another dish. (By that point I wasn't confident anything else would be better, and we really didn't have the time.) The manager offered to take the price of the meal off our bill.However, I can confirm that the ice-cream and tiramisu were fine.So, nice staff, nice atmosphere, potential for great value if the food makes the grade, but a waste of time and money if it doesn't.I sat through a three hour ballet with my tummy rumbling, unpleasantly distracted with the thought of what I could have for supper when I got home \u00a0:-(",

    "text": "I always find Carluccio a bit hit and miss. Having been there many times here are my observations. For those who are Gluten free the pasta dishes are fantastic. They're fresh and taste a whole load better than Gluten free pasta from the supermarket. The normal pasta dishes are pretty good, nothing special though. I think Carluccio wins on its risotto dishes, always delicious. They lose on their steak (always overcooked), and some of their fish dishes. The desserts are always delicious. So there you go, mixed bag!",

    "text": "I love the building of this Carluccio's because it's got a wonderful staircase that I like to imagine people in ballgowns descending from. I've been to this particular restaurant mid-week and on a Friday night and the only complaint I've got is how long we had to wait for a table on the Friday night. We didn't have a reservation, but it's Carluccio's!... There are lots of them dotted around London, so you think it wouldn't be that hard to get a table... we were wrong.That said, we were invited to sit in the store, where they sell bread sticks and meringues and flavoured olive oils, which they laid out like a feast and we were allowed to partake in. We literally tried everything there was there, so long was our wait, but my god, was the food amazing and we hadn't even gotten a table yet. It's also a good ploy to get you to buy their food whilst waiting! We were so full, we wondered whether it was worth eating food there, but eventually we got a table and ascended up the pretty staircase into the dining rooms upstairs. I recommend you have the Lemon Granita, it's my favourite drink there. It's the sort of drink you would have an a hot summer's day in Italy and I can't get enough of them!I also had the pasta con funghi that night and that was just bliss. The pasta was freshly made, the mushroom perfect cooked and the portion generous. Our server was really cool, very humorous and totally deserved the big tip we donated later. I love the dining rooms and the space and the way they are laid out and this is just a really good place if you want great food, great service and a wonderful setting. Definitely one of my top places to eat in Covent Garden!",

    "text": "This Carluccio's is very centrally located and has an added wow factor with a great circular stone staircase and a light and airy private function room with big windows. I was there for the Sicilian wine tasting evening, when qypers got to taste the entire range of Planeta wines, accompanied by some fab antipasti and cannoli to die for. These are easy-drinking wines. If you like oaky chardonnay, you'll like any of the whites (La Segreta Bianco \u00a38.95; Alastro \u00a312.50, Cometa \u00a319.50, Chardonnay). I have to declare I prefer a nice grassy sauvignon blanc from Chile/ NZ, and you just can't grow white wines like that in Sicily, so they weren't really my cup of tea (!). The reds, however, were far more up my street: big, robust flavours. The 'entry level' La Segreta Rosso was one of my faves. I also liked the top-end Santa Cecilia (\u00a319.50), the Syrah and the Burdese (=in the bordeaux style). The Cerusuolo di Vittorio (\u00a319.50) is v quirky and tastes of cherries (Cerusuolo=cherryish). Not for me, but others loved it, so clearly a personal choice. There was also a strong Merlot (14% vol) which fell somewhere in the middle of my preferences, but very quaffable. And unusually for Sicily, a Rose for \u00a310.50. Last, but certainly not least, was the lovely dessert wine Passito di Noto, a moscato bianco, which went perfectly with the divine cannoli. All the wines are available from the Carluccio's shop on the ground floor (open until 11pm). As is a very good olive oil, also produced by Planeta for \u00a314.95.",

In fact, I AM going back for more - going to Carluccio's to buy some of that most stunning olive oil. That Planeta stoned olive oil is worth every penny of it's price! The wines were all stunning with the 'gorse bush' and Saint Cecelia wines both tickling my palette in just the right way. The upstairs private dining room is beautiful but even more stunning is the downatairs space. The shop is well stocked and fun with the eatery intimate but spacious. I highly recommend a trip down here as quick as you can!",

The Planeta wines, white, red and dessert were delightful and our host Michael was very knowledgeable and dare I say very passionate about these wines. The antipasto dishes were quite individual and a wonderful mixture of delicious meats, cheeses, veggies and breads that are available to buy in the deli downstairs. To accompany the dessert wine plates of moreish cannoli appeared. Many thanks to Carluccio's for a delightful evening and I look forward to returning there for a meal in the near future.",

If you ever get a chance to wine-n-dine here (as I and about 20 other Qypers did at a Sicilian wine tasting event (london.blog.qype.com/?p=\u2026) ), by all means take advantage of the opportunity. It's a lovely spot, smack dab in the heart of Central London but above and removed from the fray. I think Carluccio's do Italian right. They offer a brilliant selection of wines (I love Planeta's Alastro) and solid antipasti. In fact, everything I've tried on their menu has been fine by me, especially the calf's liver. Drool.",

A blend of delicious meats, cheeses, veggies and breads to graze on while I sampled the Planeta wine that Carluccio's stocks. If the weather had been sunnier and the view a bit more rustic (rather than an overcast central London), I'd have sworn I'd been transported to Sicily with a group of friends. Interesting discussions were had and playful teasing happened over breads dipped in Planeta's olive oil - so buttery, with a hint of pepper. The finishing touch was a cannoli filled with a cream with bits of chocolate and candied orange peel whipped into it, and served along with a glass of Moscato. YUM! You can leave the gun, but most definitely take the cannoli!",

The place was full and we thought that was an indication of how good it was. Sadly, the crowds belied the quality.The calamari fritti that I had loved at the Pinner location, was soggy and soaked in oil. The antipasto had only meat on the platter unlike what was suggested on the menu. We had to ask for some bread to be served with the cold meats. Our request for olive oil, never materialised.We ordered the trio of pastas, including the heavily recommended ravioli. There was absolutely no hint of the sage in the dish and it felt like the ravioli had just been tossed in melted butter rather than butter browned with sage. When we brought this to the servers attention, he promised to get us a fresh plate properly made or to give us complimentary coffee, but we turned it down, since we knew we would not be able to finish the other two pastas that were quite good. The tortelloni with braised venison and the papardelle with mushroom, both of which had much more flavour to them and were much better tasting.The servers were doing their best, but they were just too badly over worked. Too many tables and not enough staff. Plus the food had to be brought up to the first floor from the ground floor, turning it slightly cold in the meanwhile.This was my first bad experience at Carluccios. I have since had horrible non service at Hampstead & less than average food at St Pancras.I loved Carluccios in Dubai. But never again in London",

Breakfast is served all day! or if your feeling indecisive you can try the trio of pasta's.They also have a great deli where they sell all of their products as well as doing a hot counter at lunch if you've got to dash.I love love love Carluccio's!",

    "text": "My wife and myself chose Carluccio's in Covent Garden for lunch recently on a visit to London. This wasn't our first visit to this restaurant, but was by far our best meal here. The menu is standard, although my wife chose the Lobster Lasagne from the specials board and said how delicious this was. The wine choice is good and the service was efficient without us feeling like we were being rushed out of the place. The only criticism I have of this venue is how crammed in you are, particularly on tables for two, and it's easy to feel like you're eating with strangers, which is sometimes really great fun, but only when you choose to. Having said this, it's perfectly understandable why they want/need to service so many covers, particularly over lunch time. The lemon tart with an accompanying glass of ice cold Limoncello is an absolute treat, and I would recommend this desert option to all non-drivers (or people who don't have to go back to work) out there.",

Pros: staff is good and reimbursed us for the soggy bruschetta. Antipasti platter was impressive. Cons: low quality food and too much clatter noise from staff tossing utensils and plates behind the bar.",

We were specifically looking to stop at Tesco to pick up a couple things.Tesco was shuttered for a remod, so we decided to check into Carluccio's for dinner.While I know it's a local chain it was quite good.The wait staff was knowledgeable and charming, the food was quite good, the portions were reasonable without being elephantine (see Olive Garden - US).The wine recommendations were very nice and a good meal was had by all.We enjoyed dinner enough that we decided to try them for breakfast as well.Their take on eggs benedict was a hit with everyone.Again, our waitress was knowledgeable and charming, helpful without hovering.We were very pleased with both of our visits to Carluccio's and I expect we will visit them again next time we're in London.",

    "text": "A friend who grew up in London suggested this to me today as a great place to get what we Americans like to call \"brunch\" that odd meal that is a combination of breakfast and lunch. \u00a0Carluccio's has a number of locations in London- but this is their flagship location.Located in Covent Garden just about a block from the Tube Station at Leicester Square, Carluccio's is located in an old building and uses all three stories with a beautiful worn stone staircase curving up and around to the upper dining area. \u00a0The place was packed (obviously everyone had the same idea) so it took awhile to get seated. Also- know that this is not a quiet restaurant so know before you go if you are looking for a quiet dining experience you won't find it here.Once seated- I had to wait about 25 minutes before I was able to flag someone down to see about placing my order. \u00a0While apologetic- I watched table after table try to get our server's attention to no avail.I wanted to order Eggs Benedict but they had run out of hollandaise sauce (odd since it is made with eggs and lemon juice and some spices which a restaurant surely must have) but I went along with it and ordered scrambled eggs with mushrooms, tomatoes and ham instead.The food came up promptly although the toast that was described on the menu was actually under the food rather than served on the side. \u00a0It was all very salty which was also surprising given the movement toward lowered sodium in the UK.I decided to redeem my visit (and get the salt taste out of my mouth) with a dish of strawberry gelato which was absolutely delicious (what can be wrong with gelato of any flavor, I ask you?)All in all . .a bit pricey for what you get and I wish the service had been better. \u00a0But as for that gelato? \u00a0I'd go back in a second!",
