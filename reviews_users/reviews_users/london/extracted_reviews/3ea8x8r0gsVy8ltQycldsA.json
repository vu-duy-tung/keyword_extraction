I guess this place passes the Asian quota (unlike some Ba*a*a Tr\u20ac\u20ac places I've been to :) - Still don't know why people go there). Anyway, it is as people say, one of the best places for a good Roast Duck. Always go boneless - it's just easier. Don't order the Siew Yok (pork belly) there are better places for it. But a good combo that is basically my regular order:1. Roast Duck (boneless)2. Aubergine with minced pork3. Salt and Chili squid 4.

The same could probably be said for the \"locals\" that queued up to get inside. MY cunning brain knew about the possible queues on a Saturday night so I reserved a table. Typically with most Chinese restaurants, its all about filling the tables, meaning our table was NOT reserved despite us arriving 10mins early. After a 30min wait the, waiter apologised and offer us free house soup. Unfortunately we're all to used to being treated in this conveyor belt type service: wait your turn, eat, bill arrives before your last bite, get shunted out so that they can once again fill the table.I can't complain about the food. It IS good and you can find many traditional dishes, despite the obligatory lemon chicken and spring rolls for westernised tastes. Duck is comparable to Four Season, but is it better/worse? You decide.My one recommendation would be the chefs special: Japanese tofu with pork and mushrooms served in a clay pot.",

    "text": "Alright, this is place is definitely a place to try when in England. My friend recommended me to come eat here and stated that it's an England must even though it sounds odd. My friend was definitely right! This place has the most succulent duck and \"cha siu\". I practically devoured that duck. The \"cha siu\" was really good and not dry, it's just sad they sell out! But once you taste it you'll understand why. The duck is not dry, and I cant express more how succulent it is. Why I docked stars is because the server, ANN or ANNA, single-handled destroyed my appetite. We ordered type A vegetables and when the vegetables was served it was type B. We told the another server nicely, \"umm we ordered type A, is it possible to change it? if not it's fine we'll just take it then.\" ANN or ANNA looked and saw us and just screamed, \"That's what you ordered!\" My friend and I know the differences between our vegetables, alright. And we asked for an exchange not your life. So they took the vegetables and NEVER came back with another. At that point we were full anyways so we didnt want to bother arguing. The whole time ANN or ANNA gave a face like she someone held crap right under her nose.Then the second time when I came in to buy take out. I ordered my take-out and went to go buy some souvenirs while we waited for it to be ready. Once again, none of ANN or ANNA's business she decided to butt in and kill my appetite and fuel my anger towards how terrible of a service this extremely yummy place has. I came back for my take out to pay for the order and pick it up. I walk in and asked the first lady I saw, \"i'm here for my take out.\" The lady tells ANN or ANNA, this lady is here for her take out. and ANN or ANNA yells, \"DID SHE PAY YET?!\" oh my gosh.. seriously? like people ask for the food and run?? you didnt even tell me the price yet, how the heck am I suppose to know how much to pay you? That's why i'm here to pick up the take out? sheesh. Such a demeaning tone. She seriously needs to change her service ways, or probably more people will stop going even if the food is awesome. Totally dont want to see her or be served by her.",

What I tend to go for, however, is the stewed brisket of lamb with dry bean curd and a Japanese bean curd dish. The former, other than the most recent time I was here, has always proved to be nothing short of mouthwateringly delicious. They did their best to ensure a fast turnaround by bringing the bill to our table unasked, but, other than that, service was pretty decent. For instance, the waitress brought over our bowls of nai tong without being asked unlike some other Chinese restaurants. Also, they do take credit cards now. Just not American Express.",

    "text": "The owners of Gold Mine are the former owners of Four Seasons, who eventually sold the business to the Royal China group in 2007. For regular Four Seasons patrons, you'll recognise the manager (uncle in glasses). The head waiter is Malaysian (I met him eating breakfast one day in Malaysia Hall), and some of the other staff are also Malaysian, which helps to explain their claypot fish curry (see below).Anyway, the roast duck is good, and you can ask them to debone the duck so that it's easier to eat. We usually have half a duck, with their \"pei pa\" taufu (house specialty), garlic kai lan, salt & pepper squid, black pepper beef.Duck - their have a very nice sauce with the duck, which is slightly sweeter than Four Seasons (which has a more herbal taste). The duck itself is nice and moist, and is not as fatty as the ducks at Four Seasons (up to personal preference).Taufu - large pieces of deep fried taufu, stuffed with minced pork and prawns, served with a mushroom sauce, and baby bak choy. This is their house specialty taufu, and is very tasty.Claypot fish curry - this is the real star of the show, the unsung hero of Gold Mine. Not many people know that Gold Mine serves a very authentic Malaysian claypot fish curry (lemak curry style) that Malaysians will recognise instantly. It comes in a claypot, with pieces of fish coated in batter (I'm not fond of the batter), swimming in a rich curry with loads of herbs, curry leaves, etc. I've brought my Malaysian friends to this place, and they all agree that it is very authentic. It is, however, quite oily, so be warned.More often than not, u'd get their soup of the day on the house. Service can be rushed when it's busy, as they have a small place, so they rely on turnover. When they first opened, it was less busy, so you could sit there and enjoy your meal. These days, you'll be given the bill if the place is full. If you want somewhere to slowly enjoy a meal, I suggest either coming early or late, or going somewhere else. If you're happy to enjoy the food and then head somewhere else for a drink to catch up with friends, then this is a great place for food.",

My Vietnamese aunt actually makes the best duck in the workd. But sounds cool.But that duck is AMAZING (almost as good as my aunt's). The place is quite successful so you might have to wait a little bit but it is worth it (I don't say that very often, sadly for someone who lives in London I'm not a huge fan of queuing for food).We shared a \u00a38.50 portion of duck (obviously), some garlic veggies that were just crunchy and savoury and perfect, and some salt and pepper squid - very good but I could never eat a whole plate of that by myself, it's not very light!It is very reasonably priced and even with beers it cost us under \u00a340 for the two of us. I will definitely go back!",

In the dining area where it was full upon our arrival there where mainly asian customers wich to us was a good sign. We started off by sharing the \"Crispy aromatic duck\" wich is a fried and pulled version of the famous Peking duck served also with pancakes, cucumber, scallions and hoi sin. It was crispy and really good in flavors and 1/4 was enough as a starter with 3 pancakes each. Then i had the chicken szechuan that i thought was a bit different and felt more like a spicy sweet and sour sauce the szechaun i have had before (yes i have been to China for Those wondering). The flavors where ok though but the serving size could have been bigger. The Mrs was happy with her chicken in lemonsauce wich i personally felt was bit boring but thats just a matter of opinion. She has had it many times in the U.K and said it was good. The service was fast but without a smile or any \"extras\". Funny reading reviews about the friendly staff when i didnt see a single one of the roughly 6 waiters smile halfhearted in all my meal. Hmm ok so we where not there to socialize but it felt abit rushed as they wanted to serve us, get paid and then get some new customers taking our table. Dont like to be rushed when im at a restaurant so this also affects my grade. \u00a0Prices \"ok\" for U.K and the food was ok but i cant say this is a \"must go\" to place for chineese food in London.",

There was a perfect duck meat to fat ratio and the sauce was more savoury than sweet - something else that I like a lot. This place is often compared to (sshh) Four Seasons, just down the road. Honestly, I prefer this place. Four Seasons is great, but their duck is fattier than I'd usually prefer and their sauce is rather sweet as well. The duck skin is crispier at Gold Mine too. Though, which restaurant you prefer probably comes down to personal taste. Try both and make your own decision if you can! If not, I'd recommend you eat at Gold Mine first.",

Roast duck is tasty - meat was tender and moist, very nice and consistent layer of subcutaneous fat. We opted for a deboned duck, and the chef's deboning skills are excellent - not even a bone fragment. However, \u00a0skin was not as crispy as we would have liked - just a touch too soft for our preference. Roast pork was decent, skin was very crispy and there was a good proportion of fat to meat. However, the meat was just slightly over salted. Stir-fried veggie was way over salted. While the veggies were well saut\u00e9ed, the chef just got way too carried away with the oyster sauce. I'm a huge fan of Cantonese style roast duck, and I'm blessed to have regular access to really good duck back home. This place definitely isn't the best, but for London I reckon it's as good as it gets. Well worth a try if you've never tried Cantonese roast duck.",

The curried lamb was quite delicious too, lots of cinnamon and star anise in it. Soup was a simple chicken and sweetcorn and there was nothing wrong at all with it.In all, this place is special not because it does anything extremely well, but because it does almost everything right with little fuss. The limited dessert range was disappointing, but it's likely because they were about to close when we wanted to order this. We managed to order a red bean pastry dessert which was probably frozen and a little oily without the normally customary sago pudding dessert.In all, if you're looking for some decent Chinese around Bayswater and don't want to risk disappointment, then Gold Mine is the safe bet. There are a lot of cantonese people that eat here. A good sign.Otherwise there are plenty of Malaysian restaurants around due to the ex-pat community, and the nearby Malaysian hall, but the quality of these places aren't close to the cuisine you'd actually find in Malaysia. So again chinese here might be the safest bet.",

I went to heaven for 1s after the first bite. It was soft, juicy and tasted divine. The side dishes which my friend ordered were also great. We had spicy tofu minced pork in a clay pot, stir fry kailan, yummy shrimp dish (not so sure the exact name). A very standard satisfying oriental meal (especially for a international student in London like me)The only minor complain is the service here. But I am willing to look past that since it is such a busy place. In fact, the place was so packed that there was hardly any room to move.And one small tip: there is a place called \"tinseltown\" near the restaurant. If you still have room for dessert, I suggest you come there and treat yourself another round with ferrero rocher milkshake. I actually even bought giant bubble wand in a pound shop and play with it when I was having my milkshake. (In case you were wondering, yes, conveniently there is also a poundshop from Goldmine to Tinsel Town that sells F*** underwear - you get the idea haha) Divine roast duck + Milk shake + Bubble = Perfect night out :)",

(I have lunch in this area every 7-10 days and end up at My default picks for Thai or Spanish food most of the time)This time I set out determined to eat the roast duck at Gold Mine and check what the fuss was all about.Oh my! That duck was gorgeous! The fat melting in the mouth was like a beautiful piece of pork fat - I've never tasted duck fat like that & at the same time the skin was crispy too and the meat ever so tender.My favourite meat is pork, but the barbecued pork (also good) did not hold a candle to this roast duck! I chose the Singapore vermicelli noodles to go with my meal. They were just what I wanted - really thin fine noodles, fried up street food style and just perfect with the fat of that perfect duck. All 3 dishes for 22\u00a3.I've got to take the family here to try this duck. I was lucky to not have to brave a queue at 2:30pm, but the restaurant was quite full. However, I must say that standing in line would be worth it for this roast duck. Just the duck & a side of noodles or rice would be perfect.",

    "text": "Talking about famous Cantonese Roast Duck. \u00a0This restaurant has also one of the best cantonese roast duck in London. \u00a0Rumour has it that the chefs from Four Seasons actually worked here for some time before going back to Four Seasons again. \u00a0Unsure the reason. \u00a0Dispute??Anyway, I have to say the tenderness of the duck here is equal to the one in Four Seasons. \u00a0No difference. \u00a0The difference lies in the ratio of the fat of the duck and the sauce that accompanies the duck. \u00a0The duck fat here is less compared to Four Seasons and is more lean. \u00a0So healthier. \u00a0That said, who in the right mind would want to eat Cantonese Roast Duck and be healthy. \u00a0So this is negligible. \u00a0The sauce which accompanies the duck here however seems to be more to the savoury side compared to the one in Four Seasons. \u00a0The one in Four Seasons is slightly sweeter. \u00a0I prefer the Four Seasons slightly sweeter version.I do not see much difference in the duck to be honest. \u00a0Both of them were cooked similarly. \u00a0The other chinese food here I cannot comment much as I haven't really tried much. \u00a0But probably a bit slightly better than Four Seasons. \u00a0The staff here are also much nicer and more polite compared to the one in Four Seasons. \u00a0You expect to be scolded and shouted at in Four Seasons. \u00a0To those who cannot stand rude staff and long queues, I would probably recommend Gold Mine.",

The food is even better than some of the restaurants in Hong Kong.Their signature dishes, Cantonese roast duck and golden sand prawn, were exceptionally good (SOO GOOD). I had them few weeks ago with my clients. Both dishes had me craving for them in the past few weeks. I ended up going back with my friends, and obviously, they loved them too. Most of their other dishes were also good. The menu is huge and I am sure there are many other delicious dishes.Chinese restaurants are often associated with bad services, but not in Gold Mine. Most of the staff were very welcoming and friendly (at least the three who served us). Another plus was the restaurant is quite spacious, unlike those in China town where you literally have to sit back to back with the table behind you. To sum up, it is now my go-to Cantonese restaurant in London. (Make sure you book in advance as they are busy all the time)",
