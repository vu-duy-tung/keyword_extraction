They don't leave a lot of room for moving around and the tables are too close together. Service is......well, it's a cheap buffet! You don't need to ask for your bill, it's plonked on your table as soon as you get your first platefull. Pay on the way out.If you want a good, cheap Chinese meal, pop round the corner to the noodle bar in Leicester Square.",

    "text": "I always believe that the sign of a good Chinese restaurant/buffet/all you can eat is that it is frequented by Chinese people. Mr Wu's is one of these places. The food appears authentic, and although quite basic, is very tasty with lots of choice. There are dozens of more expensive chinese restaurants in the area where the food is better but then again you get what you pay for. I can't understand why some people have quoted it costing them \u00a38.50/person as it quite clearly states on the window \u00a34.95 all you can eat. Its not really important that the service is poor (they don't charge for it), it doesn't really matter that they only clean the tables with tap water as you eat off plates which are hot when you take them out of the plate warmer, and the tables are far cleaner than most fast food establishments. It would be nice to get a smile out of the staff, other than when you are leaving, and it would be nice to be able to finish your meal before they drop the bill on your table as they are walking past, it would also be nice to be asked if you would like a drink when you sit down and not to have to chase a member of staff (although contrary to above comments, 2 people on our table were served tap water). Its fast and furious, get in eat your fill and leave, so who really cares that the service is not that great, you are not there long enough to worry about it and the most important element to any restaurant, THE FOOD, is excellent (and it is only \u00a34.95).",

    "text": "Continuing my theme of fast cheap eats this evening, Mr Wu is part of a disturbing trend in Chinatown of pile 'em high buffets. Judging from the proliferation of these places and the long queues snaking out of them, customers are being drawn in on the basis of priceTo be fair, the idea of eating as much as you can for as little as you can pay is very appealing. The choice of dishes is also cleverly chosen - while limited, it probably covers the few dishes which most westerners would order.However, expect gloopy, over sweet sauces, MSG loaded savoury dishes (the thirst after the meal is the clue) and over dry crispy dishes.I would highly recommend that you take yourself round to corner to somewhere like Wan Chai Corner where you can have a main dish for one person for around \u00a34 at lunchtime and \u00a35-6 at dinner, which is much better value for money at not much more cost",

Very fairly priced for such a central location (just off London's China Town), the restaurant can seat approximately 30 people upstairs and 100 downstairs. The place is clean, and well staffed, however the staff are not all friendly or particularly English speaking. Forks and spoons are provided as standard alongside chopsticks. The food is kept warm and replaced often. Food highlights include the broccoli and cabbage stirfry, belly of pork, duck and lemon chicken. There are several varieties of rice and noodles, prawn crackers, spring rolls and seaweed as you'd expect. Fruit is available for desert. A MAJOR downside to Mr Wu's is the drinks choices. They refuse point blank to serve free tap water, and soft drinks / bottled water are below par with regards to quality (and overpriced).",

    "text": "Mr Wu borders on the Curates egg syndrome (without reference to food hygiene): the intention is good but the staffing, and service really let it down. It is encouraging to see more buffet style, hassle free, restaurants offering good food - particularly in 'China Town' where the quality is surprisingly variable. However, once you are ushered away into a dark corner (literally) away from view, the staff will seldom pay you any attention unless they feel they can flog off another exorbitantly priced beer or (suspiciously watery) soft drink. The food does taste good, and is impressively varied, although at times it is depressingly salty, which reveals the main intention of the place which is just to extract as much money out of you as possible. In it's defence, the quality of the food (esp. meat) does not raise too many questions, unlike many other 'restaurants' operating in the area. In order to exploit maximum profit, the meat is sparse and generously supplemented with vegetables, (and frequently, salt and MSG); however on a good day the proportions can be fine. Most importantly, one does not get the impression that there shall be any imminent health and safety scares, or at least we hope not. I hope other quality restaurants spring up in China Town, especially those competitive in price, high in hygiene, and with healthier food and friendly service. Until then, if you're on a budget, just bite your tongue, go to Mr Wu's then to a bar elsewhere for more reasonably priced drinks and better service.",

    "text": "The friendly man greeting people resembled someone I knew so I entered with a good feeling. \u00a0You could also see a lot of people inside through the window so we assumed this restaurant would be okay. \u00a0The buffet food is really terrible, though--poor variety, little taste, and unhealthy dishes. \u00a0We also had to carry our food to the second floor up a narrow flight of stairs. \u00a0The restroom in the basement was so horrible that you should probably not use it. \u00a0Not-so-negative aspects of this restaurant were the staff was polite and I did not get sick from eating there. \u00a0Despite being hungry, we ended up eating very little there because the food was so unappetizing. \u00a0This restaurant is super cheap for a reason. \u00a0Even if you are skint, avoid this place.",

    "text": "The staff members weren't really nice, to be quite honest, they were just standing there with a cold look on their faces. It's cheap and you basically get what you pay for: cheap food. It was definitely one of the worst Chinese meals I've ever had, and it made me feel quite a strong stomachache the next day. I see many people say they were happy they didn't get sick after eating here but hey, I wasn't that lucky... It sucks that London is such an expensive city because I've eaten great food in Japan and Spain for way less than that price, but there's nothing that saved this place in my opinion as it was just bad.",

    "text": "Its amazing how few cheap buffets there are in London. The food is all bad. For 5 quid I don't think its fair to expect much better unlimited food. Pork balls were like rocks. The only reason I'd give it any stars at all is the price. I can see the logic in having dirt cheap food. I am just more discerning now.",

    "text": "Not the best Chinese meal I've had, not by a long shot. But it was \u00a35.95 for all I could shovel down my throat, and I was damn hungry, so I couldn't really complain. Also, there were 2 or 3 different vegetable dishes to go with my rice and noodles, which is more choice than a lot of the other cheap buffets in China Town. And with a side serving of sweet and sour sauce, they were somewhat palatable. The spring rolls - they get a thumbs up from me. Actually, I'm craving them now...",

Easy - NO \u00a0it was Shite. \u00a0I'd review what I had that but I\"m bloody not sure WHAT it was I had. \u00a0awful, barely edible, I can still SMELL the godawful stench.14 years later I come back to do a query and notice there is still \"a\" Mr. Wu. \u00a0The location might have changed, the decor might be newer, but I know a rat when i see one (and hell, you'll prob eat one here too).Stay far far away. \u00a0Go find Wagamama.",
