    "text": "I think the way to go is to get the fish pie (which isn't all that pricey compared to other dishes) and oysters. As it happens, this wasn't what I was in the mood for these classics when I was there so I had the seafood bisque (delicious) and the salmon cake. The salmon cake was also great, but a bit on the super-rich side. It came with a good, creamy sauce, and sat perched above a bundle of sauteed spinach, which helped cut some of the richness. There was no way I could finish the whole thing.I went at lunch, when it is probably easier to get a booking. There seemed to be a lot of late-lunchers (after 1:30) and the crowd was definitely all business. \u00a0A casual tourist in some tennis shoes might not feel right at home.",

    "text": "I stumbled onto this place by accident, via a series of tubes called the internet. I was in London, craving seafood, and something within walking distance from my flat at Trafalgar. J. Sheekey seemed to fit the bill, and I liked the name. I called it, with affection, J. Skeezy. I had the temerity to call at 6:30 on a Saturday night and ask for a table for two. To their credit, they did not laugh at me and hang up, and when I asked if there was anything available on Sunday, they gave me a table at six but said I would have to clear out by eight. This is something that I notice they do in London that is, to my knowledge, fairly unheard of in the states.The J. Skeezy legend grew after I asked a London mate of mine about the place. He said the place was booked well in advance, and when I told him I had a table reserved for six the next evening, he was, as they say, gobsmacked. So my girl and I were stoked about what was to come.J. Sheeky is old school, and old school done right. There is a wealth of oak and walnut restaurants in London--many of which obviously cater to tourists who expect this kind of decor--but the spit and polish on J. Sheeky was exemplary. And the service was equally refined: the head waiter took our order, but the water was poured and dishes were served by an ever-attendant staff of two or three waiters who actually seemed to pay attention to what was going on at our table. This said, I found it odd that were stuck at a very small table for two in the back of the restaurant (by the emergency exit) when there were many open tables that would allowed us to be more comfortable. When we finished our meal and walked out at about 7:45, many of these four-tops were still unused. So much for the legend of this place being booked the the gills.The food was quite good, and also considerably pricey. We started with a dozen Scottish oysters that truly rocked, followed by appetizers: dressed crab (cold Cornish crabmeat served with minced hardboiled egg and a crab mayonnaise) and pan-seared scallops with bacon and baby greens. Both were fresh and perfectly prepared.For entrees, she had the lobster and avocado salad, and I had the whole roasted bream (aka Dorado). Again, these dishes were well-prepared, but nothing to write home about, especially given the prices. I have eaten at many a fine fish establishment where the waiter took a moment to debone to fish. The bream, served head and all, was moist and flavorful, but also packed with bones. I spent a lot of time just trying to remove all the bones. I suppose for some this is considered an enjoyable pasttime. We skipped dessert, opting to wait for the Marks & Spencer bread-and-butter pudding we had sitting in our fridge back at the flat. All in all, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a solid seafood meal in London, and who is not on a budget. There was certainly nothing wrong with our meal, but there also nothing particularly special about it that would prompt me to give it four stars. Although the food was practically perfect, there was that inexplicable feeling that something was missing.",

The ingredients were so fresh and full of flavour, so light that you could just eat more and more.I had great john dorey dsh with clams for main and delilcious scallops with parma ham to start thers also a lovely dessert menu with some great classics such as bakewell tart crumble.

It's easy to find - just look for the doorman wearing an elegant top hat outside the entrance.The interior is very welcoming, with red leather banquettes and wood-panelled walls covered with photos from the 1940s and 50s.We enjoyed gravlax with marinated cucumber and sauteed scallops with mashed cauliflower as starters, then had fried filet of haddock with crisp chips and mushy peas and curried monkfish and prawns with butternut squash and rice for our entrees. For dessert we shared rhubarb and apple crumble with custard.Our waiter recommended a nice bottle of French white that was a perfect complement to our meal.The food was outstanding, and service was friendly and formal without being fussy. The tab for two, with tip, was \u00a380.On weekends they offer a 3-course menu for only \u00a324.50.Please note that jackets are NOT required, although I would leave the shorts and trainers at home.",

Now for me dinner is all about the dessert - and there isn't a very wide choice at the Oyster bar. Most of it involved some kind of ice cream which I don't like as it hurts my teeth. \u00a0I guess most people don't go there for pudding... however the our new best friend the waiter came to the rescue by pointing out the selection of 'brownie, fudge, cookie, eccles cake' which was hidden in with the coffees. I said I didn't really like fudge - and he then came back and offered to substitute it with an extra brownie. Now for \u00a34 I was expecting a couple of teeny squares to arrive - but it was just fantastic - one of the best desserts I've had in ages. Two quite reasonably sized slices of excellent, squidgy brownie - a small, slightly chewy chocolate cookie - and the most gorgeous eccles cake... I've never liked them in the past but this was like a taste of Christmas, lovely, crispy pastry, packed full of currants and some kind of spiced moist, almost marzipan stuff at the centre. Yum. And even on a busy Friday they never once hassled us to give back the table. The nicest service, and the best value meal I've had in a long time.",

My first visit was for my graduation, 2nd visit was in summer for my anniversary and my third visit 2 weeks ago was for my partners birthday. Each and every visit has been an epic gastronomic treat. They just know how to cook food perfectly. The dover sole is beautiful, as is the roasted shell fish and lobster. I hate oysters but have been told they are sweet and taste of the sea. I have had scallops on all three occasions and have never been left other than gagging for more. The food is always exceptionally fresh and moreish. The wine list is varied and offers complex yet lovely wines and on the Champagne list I would recommend the Billecart Salmon Rose. It's not cheap but it is worth it. For desserts, there is only one dessert as far as I am concerned: Scandanavian Iced Berrries. These iced gems come with a hot white chocolate sauce which is poured over them in a true theatrical fashion. The hot chocolate makes the berries melt and they make their own sauce which leaves you wanting to lick the plate clean. It is a must try if you go there. Getting a table can be a bind but generally if you opt for a day in the week about 3 weeks in advance you should be fine. The food here isn't cheap, but the experience is amazing and you will not visit a finer fish restaurant anywhere else in London.",

As we were early for our reservation (which I recommend you booking) we were seated in the J. Sheekey oyster bar next door.The oyster bar was something out of the 1940's. Silverware, fabric wrapped lemon to wash your hands and an excellent cocktail menu to go with your oysters. We didn't have any oysters as we didn't want to spoil our dinner but from the others whom were ordering them, they looked amazing!We had one champagne cocktail for \u00a39 which is very refreshing, once we had taken a few sips, the waiter moved our drinks onto our food bill next door and took them over to our table waiting for us.We were then greeted by the cloakroom assistant who took our coast in exchange for a ticket, we went to our table and drooled over the menu for 5 minutes.I had a delicious king prawn and cashew nuts waldorf salad and the lobster thermidor for main. Oh my gosh.... THE BEST LOBSTER THERMIDOR I have tasted in a very long time. With my lobster i was offered chips, mash or battered her potatoes; of course i had to the battered her potatoes. It was well worth the \u00a342. To compliment my delicious meal I had two glasses of Prosecco, yum yum! Unfortunately I didn't have enough space for dessert, but more the reason for me to go back again because I'm sure it will taste outstanding.Excellent food, excellent service and wonderful experience!",

    "text": "I \u00a0cannot believe there are not more reviews for J Sheekey, simply the finest seafood restaurant in the known universe.As a Japanese person who despises sushi, (seriously I hate it, raw fish= ugh!) \u00a0seafood itself is always a stretch when it comes to culinary experiences. That is until I had my holy grail meal dining at J Sheekey. \u00a0Before my trip to London, I'd researched some notable London restaurants and J Sheekey kept popping-up, also I was suckered into making a reservation as I'd heard that David Beckham & Micheal Caine are frequent visitors, no sightings of the celebs upon dining there of course but I saved making an ass of myself whist gawking at Becks and drowning in my own salivary fluids so it's just as well...Upon arrival we are greeted by a doorman and ushered inside, the ambiance is the usual masculine touches of wood and leather, dimly lit with autographed photos of various Brit celebs of yesteryear littering the walls. The patrons seemed mostly business men with clients, and couples. We got seated next to the table with an inebriated, loud mouth and his mail-order girlfriend but we were soon pacified by the sumptuous food.Our handsome French (nice!) waiter suggests we start with the Fines de Clair oysters so hubby indulged in 6 and soon doubled his order to 12 as he downed them like a kid downs his first taste of jello shots. Hubby claims they are indeed the best oysters ever had and coming from his Canadian East Coast upbringing he's got the seafood savvy to back that up.Next I order the Scallops with mash while hubby indulges in the 22oz Dover Sole. The scallops literally melted in my mouth (mmmmouthgasm!) and are complimented perfectly with the mash which is light fluffy and neither too buttery nor too dry. Hubby is wide eyed in appreciation of his Dover sole and sadly shakes head and claims he'll probably never get fish this fresh and delicious back in Toronto... To close out this savory symphony we have the Pimms Jelly ring with peaches and Scandinavian Iced Berries with hot white chocolate for dessert...ecstasy ensues... If you are a skeptic of seafood and find yourself in London craving an excellent meal, please visit J.Sheekey and indulge in their gorgeous seafood...Red Lobster will never suffice again...",

    "text": "An out-of-town friend and I went to J Sheekey because I was in the mood for seafood. It was extremely busy so we ended up at the oyster bar instead of the restaurant. The oysters are amazing. The champagne is superb, The wine list is incredible (definitely worth coming back to just for the wine list). The crab bisque soup is exquisite. The prawn and avocado salad is oh-so delicious. By the time we got through the first page of the menu, we were too full to order a main dish. Sitting at the bar meant you have the attention (and service) of the bar tenders. It's great if you can't decide on all your dishes in one go.The decor of the restaurant is warm and inviting. Classy but not overly. The wood panelling and small rooms make the restaurant feel intimate and inviting. A great place to catch up with a friend over a decadent meal.The meal was extravagant and indulgent. It's best to go in, start ordering, and don't look at the final bill when you leave. Your stomach will thank you for it.",

It is the heart of tourism and there is no sold to it, as this is the meeting point of everybody but \u00a0belongs to nobody!Saying that I found myself there one night looking for a classy place to dine. Walking past the tube station there is a small alley with pubs. There I spotted the comedian who acts in 'Little Britain'.Furthermore, walking down the alley there was an elegant restaurant called J.Sheekey. In 1896 a seafood market stall-holder, Josef Sheekey, was granted permission from Lord Salisbury \u00a0to serve fish and seafood in his new building development in St Martin's Court. Upon the condition that he supplied meals to his lordship's private post-theatre dinner parties, J. Sheekey, the restaurant, was born.If you look for a pst-theatre dining in an elegant ambiance, this place has the best fish speciality, let alone their oyster bar. This place is expensive but very special and has all the british style and taste. A doorman opens even the door for you.",

    "text": "Restaurants come and restaurants go. But Sheekeys is always there and always brilliant. In fact, as a Londoner born and bred I can honestly say that this is in my top three all time London restaurants. Ooh. That's a big call. There are literally hundreds and hundreds of great places to eat in this amazing city. I've been to restaurants that serve better food (although frankly, not that many). I've been to a couple of places where the service was somehow more impeccable. I've been to places even more charming than this beautiful location. And I've been to places with even more of a buzz about them. But there isn't a place that combines all of the above so beautifully and to such a consistently high standard.I have been here many times over many years and have never had anything but the most wonderful meal. And so it was again last week. On edge and panicked after watching Argo at the Empire we dived into sheekeys to gather ourselves!This famous fish restaurant, over 100 years old, is tucked away in a charming alley off Shaftesbury avenue and a top hatted doorman suggests a pompous air which never materialises once inside. The buzz as you walk into this 100 year old restaurant is great. The restaurant is always choc full. Couples. Families. Business dinners. Pre-theatre. Tourists. Locals. Young. old. The place attracts everyone. And they are all here for a good time. Sheekeys is split into four rooms, all with their own little nooks and crannies. you could be in a Dickens novel when you sit down. Tables are comfy but tight. There is dark wood everywhere and framed photos of all the stars of film and theatre adorn every spare bit of wall. It's great fun just to stare at them and work out who some of the more obscure ones are. We're slap bang in the middle of theatre district and sheekeys has always catered to that crowd.The bread that arrives is gorgeously chewy and moist inside. Always gone before the first course appears.The menu is a joy. Sublimely simple dressed crab, herring and potato salad, griddled squid, mussels in a spicy soup, gradvalax, razor clams, it's all there. None of it disappoints. No fanciness called upon. Just utterly Fresh fish and crustaceons served expertly by friendly, efficient staff.I went for the queen scallops and cockles in a delicious winey sauce and it was divine. Main courses are more of the same. Simple classics accompanied by beautiful sides. Dover sole at eye watering prices, or warming fish pie at a snip. The Cornish stew is special. There's even meat if you're brave enough to ask. I saw two great burgers go out of the kitchen. But most people are there for the fish.We decided to go for the sea bass for two. A wonderful specimen baked in salt was presented to us whole for our approval. We approved. Off they went to fillet it. And back it came, expertly deboned and resplendent with a copper pan of fennel in a delicious hollandaise type sauce as accompaniment. We also ordered chips, crispy, light and fluffy and sheekeys own courgettes in Parmesan which are evil but delicious crispy rounds of courgette that you could eat forever. Everything is cooked to perfection. If we could fit a pudding in we would but we can't so we don't. It's not cheap, that's for sure. Our sea bass was \u00a364. That's a lot by anyone's standards. But it was worth it. It really was. And as I said you can eat there at far more reasonable prices if budget restricts.For consistent brilliance this place gets the full five stars. It's hard to imagine going to a restaurant so many times and always being thrilled with the whole thing but that's been our experience of this national treasure. Book up now. Get in the queue. You won't be disappointed.A quick tip. If you can get a table ask if there's room at their beautiful sweeping bar. You can eat there and if its just the two of you, it's actually \u00a0really rather fun sitting there.",

Our gracious host immediately whisked us next door into the charming Oyster Bar and settled us in a cosy corner table. We really were treated like valued regulars rather than random walk-ins and that set the tone for an absolutely fabulous evening. Starting with the best champagne I've ever tasted we munched our way through a selection of some of the best seafood I have ever tasted. Fresh and cooked to perfection there was nothing to be faulted. Rich, thick home-made mayonnaise was the perfect compliment to crisp pommes allumettes. But the best of the best was a little dish of octopus with chorizo and beans. This was out of this world and quite the best octopus preparation I have ever tasted. The waiter explained with huge enthusiasm that the dish is cooked \"sous vide\" in seawater for three and a half hours at a low temperature. It was worth every minute. Dessert was a wonderful traditional steam pudding and custard, which I rounded off with an excellent espresso. One of the best meals I've ever had the pleasure of eating, and I have been lucky enough to eat in many fine restaurants.",

Or just go to J Sheekey and see for yourself...Started with a drink in the bar area whilst we waited for our table to be ready and treated ourselves to a delicious apple sherry. Certainly strong enough to relax us and we soon forgot we were in swanksvillle surrounded by the haves and the have-mores.The seafood (and let's face it, it's pretty much all they do) is fantastic - with such a range of choice. Our friends went for the huuuuge seafood platter to share and I just couldn't believe the size of the thing (over two tiers) - my jaw dropped. Once I'd finished my razor clams I got stuck in to help them out. The oysters were delicious.Our mains were just as good, and I'm a big fan of the courgettes side dish. Fresh fish and lobster, beautifully cooked and presented and a real pleasure, treat to eat.Didn't have space for dessert but they sounded scrumptious.I don't know when I'll get back here - bookings are hard to come by and it's far from cheap, but when I do, it's going to be a real treat for me and the lucky person I drag with me.J Sheekey FTW.",

    "text": "Wow. \u00a0Another great restaurant in London near the St. Martin in the Fields church. \u00a0It's tucked away in a little alley way and it seems to be separated by an oyster bar and the restaurant. \u00a0We had reservations at 7:30PM and didn't end up there until 7:50PM because we got lost looking for it due to the detour we had to take. \u00a0The reason? \u00a0The London premiere of the movie \"Salt\". Apologies to Angelina Jolie, but we had already seen the movie and J Sheekey was more worth visiting that night than the cinema.We had actually wanted to go to the restaurant on a Sunday night, but the person we spoke to on the phone said there were out of, \"cod, sea bream, salmon, oysters, etc\". \u00a0I was like, \"Holy cow, what did they have left?\" \u00a0So we ended up going there Monday night when they had apparently gotten a new delivery of seafood.And boy, was it worth the wait. \u00a0We ordered:Roasted Cod with herbsHerb Roasted Gilt Head BreamSide of roasted squash and broccoliThe cod was tasty, but the star of the meal was the Gilt Head Bream. \u00a0It's the whole fish that comes out with the herbs stuffed in the cavity. \u00a0Just really fresh fish at its finest. \u00a0The lowest point of the meal for us was the broccoli. \u00a0It's a matter of preference I think, but the broccoli was overcooked. \u00a0Limp, almost mushy, and lifeless.We were so full we did't get any dessert this time, but reserve ahead, because J Sheekey is not in need of business, that's for sure.",

    "text": "For photos see Greedy Diva @ greedydiva.blogspot.com/\u2026  Despite there being so many new and interesting restaurants popping up in Covent Garden, it's also nice to visit one of the more old school establishments every now and then. Lunch at J Sheekey was just the ticket. The old timer at the table next to us remarked to the waiter that her mother had brought her to J Sheekey as a young girl - and it feels like that kind of place. Black and photos of theatre starlets line the mahogany panelled walls. The long standing appeal of the place comes down to its history, effortless style, seamless (if a little stiff) service and well sourced ingredients executed properly. As part of the Caprice Holdings group (which includes stalwart establishments, The Ivy and Scotts), J Sheekey is predominantly a fish and seafood restaurant, and the best of its offerings is probably not on the set lunch menu that we opted for. The plateau de fruits de mer for 2 people looks stunning. However, the weekend lunch menu, at \u00a326.50 per person for 3 courses, is probably the best means to get away lightly in what is otherwise a pricey restaurant. Gravlax with marinated cucumber and a Swedish mustard dressing was a small but silky starter, while my fabulous, tender grilled squid perched atop a sweet, nutty red pepper sauce. J Sheekey has a reputation for its fish pie - and while it's not as unctuous as the one you'll find at Bentley's, it is creamy and comforting, and laden big chunks of salmon and prawns. There's a satisfyingly thick and crispy layer of potato on top, although my pie was lacking in white fish. Since they had run out of salmon, TPG enjoyed the rich feast that was the grilled chicken with buttered cabbage and earthy wild mushrooms - a terrific, hearty option if you don't want fish. The clementine sponge pudding with warm custard is gorgeous - the perfect wintry dessert. The pretty raspberry ripple ice-cream was not as impressive, but the boozey cherries gave it a lovely kick and it came with a fine, crisp shortbread. J Sheekey also offers a fish and chips and glass of house wine deal for \u00a316.50, and it's worth keeping in mind as a pre- or post theatre option, being in the heart of West End theatre land. You could also try the J Sheekey Oyster Bar next door, which is always bustling - reservations at either the bar or restaurant can be hard to come by, so plan ahead.",

We were taking a client, and it's a good spot for that - felt a bit too formal before it got busy, but by the end of our lunch (2.30 ish) it was nice and noisy. Wood panelled comfortably small dining rooms, an older and professional clientele. Nice location, nice ambience. Service was good, although our main very slow in arriving after starters were taken away. That was a shame but not a huge spoiler. The food was good but not outstanding or memorable. We had oysters to start - delicious - and then one of our group had Pollack, one Monkfish steamed, and I had Ray Wing, which was very interesting and tasty. The veg sides were a little disappointing - the mash was a bit smash-y, carrots very tasty but perhaps one degree too al dente but the spinach (I think) creamy thing was very good indeed. Our waiter recommended a fantastic minerally white wine to set the fish off, and all was generally well in the world. I'd definitely go back. It just didn't elevate me onto another plane, at least not this time round. But certainly good enough.",

The bottle of wine came and we sat comfortably with expectations...The squid was good and the Pinot too....and from then on the night degenerated....The Sole came first and we waited for the Fillet...we waited, and waited....when some 8 minutes later it came the Sole was morphing on being luke warm....no apologies came though! We raised the matter and begrudgingly we received a half apology from Will. Still the side dishes had not arrived. We enquired and Will disappeared to then return and explain that 'someone' had made a mistake in the kitchen and that he had now cancelled the side orders. He then realised that the night was off track when he noticed we were social media users 'on Yelp'...so then came the 'buy offs'... the offers of free drinks, desserts etc. We declined, we paid the bill and departed.We will not be back...now I know no-one is perfect and mistakes are a part of life....the difference is how they are managed so with good manners and openness mistakes can be accepted. Not though when they are not willing to be opening acknowledged or when the rescue is by trying to 'buyoff' the customer. This under mines the integrity of good dining and restaurants. Well it may have been a 'one off or bad night'...with behaviours like this I hope so....!",

Creative, interesting desserts. We started with a dozen oyster and then I had the shrimp burger (to die for, you don't really need the bun) while my dining partners had the shellfish platter, which they generously offered to share. For dessert we split the Chocolate Honeycomb Bom. By far, the best dessert I had recently, on par with the Pineapple Cake at Hestons.Well worth it for a special occasion, classic London.",

    "text": "My friend and I came to the Oyster Bar last night for a catch up over some seafood and wine. I really like the bar area - it has a separate entrance and there is the option of either a table or sitting at the bar, but I thought sitting at the bar was a lot more fun and perfect for groups of 2-3 people. The staff recommended 2 small dishes per person, and on top of that we got 3 oysters each. Our waitress was very knowledgeable and explained to us the distinctions between the two main types of oysters, either delicate or strong/fishy. We opted for the former and she directed us to exactly which ones to order. The oysters are served on a platter with a lemon wrapped in gauze (very nice touch, to catch the seeds from falling out), and two lovely shallot vinaigrettes, one of which has a little bit of spiciness. We then had our two cold plates, the bass ceviche and the buffalo mozzarella. Both were amazing. The bass came with plentiful helpings of avocado and the meat was very light and tender, and I didn't taste jalapeno at all. I could not get enough of the buffalo mozzarella... the pesto really did it for me, and luckily we had a basket of bread to help finish it all off, as the two crouton crisps on the plate were definitely not enough. Our two hot plates were the flat iron steak with prawns and the griddled octopus, which I also very much enjoyed. \u00a0All in all, it was a lot of food! Of course none of this comes cheap, and the picpoul I had by the glass was also \u00a310/glass, so the damage was quite considerable. But for excellent seafood and great atmosphere, J Sheekey is well worth a visit.",

First off, service is impeccable and you will interact with several waiters and waitresses. For appetizers, I would highly suggest the beetroot and goat cheese salad and the gravlax. For my main, both times I dined at J Sheekey, I had the pan fried salmon which came with its own carafe of bubbling brown butter. I almost thought nothing could top that, but I was wrong because the desserts are even more sinfully delicious. I've tried the Cox's Pippin Apple Pie, the Sticky Ginger Pudding and the Rhubarb Crumble. You will always be offered a cup of custard to drizzle over your warm desserts and you'd be stupid not to take them up on this offer. I'm still dreaming about the two dinners I've had here! J Sheekey is a classic chic British restaurant and worth making reservations far in advance to score a table, don't miss out!",

Tables have been always quite small and settings just is not pretty - all of these have been there and nothing much changed.., what changed dramatically is good.., I tried razor clams, shrimp and sardines and my dad tried grotto misto and salmon. They were all very underwhelming..., first temperature of hot food is all off - food is slightly cold by the time they reach the table. Secondly sea food / fish are not fresh. I am not sure how this is possible in such high traffic seafood restaurant but it is possible... I could not eat my fish.., gave it to my cat later. How sad to see such a legendary restaurant turning into this tourist trap. Sadly, I probably would not go back for a few years until things change dramatically here...",

    "text": "Going to J Sheekey for their fruits de mer platter is for me the equivalent of walking into a spa. A brief respite of pure unadulterated luxury, a heady healthy hit that generally goes a long way towards improving my state of mind. The definition of a treat in other words. It hasn't changed here in years, an I mean that in a very good way. Nicco Polo and I settle into a luxurious banquette with a self-satisfied sigh entirely at evens with the surroundings. Acres of luxurious linen cloths, a friendly and superbly well drilled FOH team and an awesomely good selection of shellfish. Nothing else needed.Given my frothing tone so far, I should stress that while Sheekey is luxurious, there's nothing pretentious about it. Seeing that we were struggling and wasting time with the faff of peeling the succulent little brown shrimp, our waiter gave a handy seaside tip, pinching head and tail together to pop out the sweet, fresh goodness. If I were a newbie contemplating attacking a platter, then this level of thoughtfulness would be even more appreciated.If there's something vaguely erotic about the eating of an oyster, then fruits de mer is the culinary equivalent of no holds barred, hanging from the lampshade sex with a fruity, nubile and entirely innapropriate ex. A plethora of succulent, juicy little nubbins, blushing creamy pink morsels and taut sinews, each begging to be sampled next. Like the aforementioned illicit tryst, there's a wild menu of differnt styles, types and positions, everyone has their favourites and it's all so borderline lewd that nobody wants to imagine their parents at it.After that, an ice cold buttery white wine and something to mop up the juices (see, I said you didn't want to imagine your parents at it...) we collapse back into the banquette. Perfect, absolutely perfect.",

My favourite dish is the seafood platter which includes lobster, razor clams, prawns and scallops - irresistible! Every bite makes you feel bad for people who are allergic to shellfish; they'll never be able to experience the heaven that is the J Sheekey seafood platter. While simply put together the quality of the fish and the subtly of the flavours makes every moment memorable. The decor is charming as can be. Wood panelling, vintage photographs, thin glassware, lovely china and soft light gives you a sense of age, class and warmth. The service is impeccable - waiters are neither in your face nor absent. It's service that you just don't really notice which is my favourite. You have everything you need when you need it, and are left to just enjoy yourself.",

You would assume they saved a table for us. We then asked for a table and they seated us directly next to where the wait staff meets. They barely paid us any attention, and to make matters worse my mother's fish was undercooked. When she asked for a glass of wine they gave her one with about two sips worth in it, and didn't show her the bottle.

I dined at J Sheeky over ten years ago with my grandfather and recently returned there on a trip with my husband. The restaurant was as cozy and comfortable as I remembered and the food was still excellent. My husband started with oysters and I had tuna tartare. Both were clean, fresh, and delicious. The server also provided excellent information about the different oyster options. For our main courses, my husband ordered dover sole and I ordered cod. Both were excellent, but the quality especially showed in the seafood risotto underneath my cod. It was full of plump, fresh shellfish and absolutely delicious. I had to fight my husband off as he kept trying to dig in to my plate! For dessert, we shared a dish of ice cream (cherry swirl--Mmmmmmm!). There were lots of good wines by the glass, so we started with a glass of champagne and then had chablis with our mains. It was a lovely evening with delicious seafood. What more could we want?I see some other reviewers had issues with service. We had a reservation and our table was waiting when we arrived. Our service was excellent--there when we wanted someone, but never overbearing. No issues or concerns whatsoever in this regard.",

The entire dish had gentle heat from the chillies with lemon and other flavours making my only disappointment that I had no more to eat! Enough for a light main but not too big for a starter.

We had high expectations as this place was recommended by the concierge at Claridges Hotel who is normally spot on. Food was not bad as we had a number of different items off the Oyster Bar menu, which is tapas style, ordered three separate times. However the dishes came out slowly and in the wrong order. In fact the first thing we ordered was the last to come out. \u00a0To top it off we were asked to move inside as they were closing up the outside dining area due to the late hour. If they had served us properly we'd have been long gone by that point. The bass ceviche was excellent and the star of the show. \u00a0But you can do better for seafood in London.",

    "text": "Lovely restaurant in St Martins Court. Within the depths of the theaters and with Oyster Bar written on the side facade, this place is quite an establishment.Service:Service here is rather fascinating, as there are some negatives for such a restaurant along with the overall professionalism. One incident was when one of the waiters served us the adjacent table's wine on top of our table's wine. It was even more interesting that the waiter never mentioned the mistake to either table. Otherwise it was pretty quality minus the above and a few other minor incidents.Venue:Dimly lit by candlelight, but the expectations for more intimate conversations were never met as the place was loud. Seating is very closely packed. Everywhere in London is typically tightly packed, but this felt just that bit more than others. So expect to be at arms reach of the other table's bread bowl.Food:Oysters - Porthilly RocksClean oysters. Accompanying sauces also provided a nice citrus kick or slightly spicy kick.Smoked Haddock with horseradish mash, poached egg and whole grain mustardQuite a good dish overall, but I'm a sucker for poached eggs on almost anything. The flavor of the fish itself wasn't on display as the mustard and the yolk over powered everything. It wasn't a bad thing as I really enjoyed the dish.Virunha Chocolate CakeDeep chocolate flavor. Must have for chocolate lovers. But if you're looking for something else then the pear tart is what to get, which apparently was absolutely delicious.Wine:Quite a nice wine list. We picked the Cuv\u00e9e Tradition 2012, Les Filles de Septembre, C\u00f4tes de Tongue. A nice wine that is mild in nature and a small hint of spice.Even with the service miscues and the pricey menu, I found the place very good and really enjoyed my time there.",

I wish it would have been a four or a five star experience, but alas it certainly wasn't.Every time I visit my sister and her family in London they take me out to a nice dinner. It's a pretty good trade. This year I suggested seafood and they got us a reservation here at J Sheekey. I was excited reading about it, but once I got there the feeling evaporated.My partner and I arrived a bit before my sister and her husband. I checked in at the host's stand and preemptively said we would wait in the bar until the rest of our party had arrived. I've worked in restaurants for years, I know how it works. Anyhow, the maitre d insists we go ahead and take our table. We oblige. My sister and her husband get caught up in traffic and we are waiting there for over 40 minutes and not even once did a member of the waitstaff (who were ALL OVER the other tables) even offer us a drink or acknowledge we existed. Sure, they were all over us once the rest of the party arrived, but we both felt so awkward from the experience that there really was no bouncing back. Snooty, snooty, snooty. The food was good, this is true. But not better than many other seafood restaurants I've been to. Certainly not worth putting up with the poor service. The decor seemed incredibly dated to me as well. Some people call that an \"institution\". I call it time to remodel. Pass",

    "text": "We were looking for a seafood restaurant close to where we were staying for our first meal in London, so we ended up making a noontime reservation at J Sheekey. It is centrally located to a lot of theaters in the West End, so perhaps unsurprisingly, the first question we were asked is if we had a time limit to meet to make a show. Since we didn't, it did allow us to enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant a bit more, and to be honest, I found it quite nice - despite the low ceilings, the floor layout is a bit asymmetric, allowing for spacious seating and \u00a0enough room to make the seating feel cozy without resorting to NYC-levels of closeness. The service was a bit on the leisurely side, but everything came out in a well-spaced manner, although being next to the dumbwaiter was pretty fun...had never seen one of these food 'elevators' in action up close.The food...well, to be honest, my assessment went down as the meal went down, with the main course unfortunately being noticeably worse than the rest of the meal. We started out with some oysters to share, which were solid if unspectacular - the Natives were the my favorite with a clean and relatively smooth finish, but we were told the other two were similarly briny - not the case (one was extremely briny, with the others being of medium salinity). Additionally, the jalape\u00f1o-infused mignonette seemed like a good idea, but it was a bit strong on the nose and made it hard to really enjoy the flavor of either the mignonette or the oyster. Next up was the crab bisque (for me) and the truffle artichoke soup (for my wife). I liked hers better - it had stronger flavors - and while I did enjoy the bisque, the marginal amount of crab meat actually in it was disappointing. The mains are hard to explain, though, given the passable nature of the rest of the meal. My filet of cod was ridiculously undercooked...probably because the cut of the fish was way too thick. Eating undercooked cod with no flavor is just...not good at all. No amount of risotto (served under it) helped on that front. My wife's seafood stew was served out of a copper pot and looked promising, but it was devoid of any kind of salt, giving the broth a very flat tomato flavor that didn't even infuse any of the seafood into it.We skipped dessert because we were full (we were champs and ate most of the food, although I had to leave about half of my cod untouched). While the start of the meal was okay, the entrees were highly disappointing, and after seeing the bill come out to ~150 pounds...well, it's hard for the math to add up to a high rating. I enjoy the ambiance, and location is nice if you are going to a show, but I would definitely seek out another place if you are looking for a seafood-oriented meal first.",

Needless to say, it's quite hard to find a restaurant which fits the diet (and where I would not get tempted by fries or other fried deliciousness). I went there last week with the BF and we loved it!! We ordered a plateau de fruits de mer for 2 and it was heaven!! (I have previously posted picture of it, it looks like food porn!!) Also the waiter was knowledgeable about the food and also the wine to go with it (and he answered so quickly to \"which wine goes best with this ?\" \u00a0that I ordered a bottle of the said delicious white wine -I know it doesn't fit the diet, but you only live once and it was fab!!)We ate most of it - to our waiter's amazement; he wouldn't believe that I, a size 10/12 young woman could eat so much... (Guess why I am on a diet :/) i could have explained to him that seafood is very good for you, it's lean and the only fat it has is full of omega 3 and so on but I kept on eating my langoustine instead :) Even the mayonnaise - I had to try it- was nice, my dad makes a very similar one with just a bit mor pepper in it. (And of course, my dad's mayonnaise is the best one in the whole world) To sum up : great food, great wine, great service! Num num num!! I'll be back soon!!!",

For the main entree, I had the fish stew and the BF had the fish pie. The fish stew had an assortment of seafood, including mussels, scallops, shrimp, fish, and was really rich and savory. On the other hand, I didn't like the fish pie. I think it was the texture and consistency of the fish that I didn't like. I ended up eating just the mashed potato inside. If you like seafood and want something a little more upscale, this is a good try!",

The old school, dark wood interior does not detract from what is a thoroughly modern restaurant, that nonetheless has not lost touch with its roots. Front of house is generally efficient and polite - after booking on line, I had a slight worry when I was called three times in one ten minute period about confirming my booking. All, seemingly, by the same person. Never mind; even mid week, this place was buzzing, but not so crammed that we had to wait when we did turn up ( twenty minutes early).Starters run around the \u00a312-17 mark; we had razor clams , and octopus with pink fir potatoes. Immaculate. Mains, skate for me, cod for my wife, ditto immaculate. With dessert, a decent bottle of Albari\u00f1o and coffee, the bill came to around \u00a3200. But then, to somewhat paraphrase Anthony Bourdain, why would bargain seafood be a good idea?",

    "text": "Oh, J Sheekey, it really kills me to have to write a not-glowing review for you. My last experience was so horrid that I would give it 2 stars based solely on that but due to previous positive experiences (that could have earned it 4, if not 5 stars) I will give it 3 stars. Prior to my last visit I had only ever visit with my parents, i.e. adults. I distinctly felt that my boyfriend and I were not treated with as much respect merely because of our age (24 and 25). We were treated rudely and pretty much ignored. Our waiter mocked our orders. My boyfriend ordered two salads (one was a typical lettuce-based salad and another a lobster-based salad) and I just wanted an assortment of shellfish like oysters and prawns. I know this may not be typical, but I don't think it merited mocking. In fact, I don't know if it's ever right to mock people when they're paying you for your services. I also am not familiar with prawns as they are not the norm in the states (shrimp cocktails are) and I wanted to know the difference between the two offered and the waiter acted as if it were the most ridiculous and trying fete he'd ever encountered. At this point, I was ready to ask to speak to the manager when we left, but our service greatly improved as the night went on. Unfortunately, our meal did not. I got food poisoning from my oysters and was ill throughout the entire night and morning. The one great thing they do have going for them still in my mind is that they are very accommodating when it comes to pre- and post-theatre dinners.",

This was my second dinner of the night (had just finished a tasting menu an hour earlier) so I wasn't very hungry. I had the tomato salad and split the grilled turbot for two with b\u00e9arnaise sauce. Both were very good. The b\u00e9arnaise sauce was amazing, it was thicker, almost a butter consistency, and made the dish great. The butternut squash side dish is the best I've had. I also had some of the creamed cauliflower soup with oxford blue cheese and walnuts. London makes the best veggie soups. For all of you struggling veggie eaters, the soups here make it so easy to get your daily suggested servings. It was only an hour long dinner break for my husband (poker tournament) so we didn't have time for dessert, but I assume it would have been amazing.anitaeat.com",

The atmosphere in J Sheekey (which is just tucked around the corner from Leicester Square tube station) is one of understated elegance and you can tell it's going to be a place with good, discrete service.The menu did indeed have a large selection of fish and shellfish and I opted for the somewhat traditional haddock and chips and mushy peas with some shared sides of steamed spinach and broccoli.The waitress informed us that our mains would take 20 mins (since we had not ordered a starter) which was helpful I thought.When the food arrived, it was well presented and all parties were served simultaneously. The fish was battered and crisp outside but moist inside, the chips crispy too and the mushy peas very green and smooth! Overall the food was excellent but what was even more impressive was the dessert! I wanted the double-choc souffle but due to time constraints (it takes about 20 mins to prepare) I had a vanilla Creme Brulee. This was one of the nice slim, wide dishes not the small deep dishes (which means you get short-changed on all that sugary topping!) It was really nice and tasty and scooping down into it revealed vanilla seeds at the bottom of the dish, which was pretty clever. I had half before I was stuffed and my colleague fiinished off the rest.All in all, yummy, good service, not too pricey (about \u00a330 per head) but not cheap either, but worth every penny!",

On arrival to a fairly empty restaurant we were asked if 'we were attending the theatre this evening.' We correctly replied that we weren't and thought no more of this inoquous question. The starters arrived, which were nice, but then time seemed to stand still on our table. People arrived, ordered and were served - not just one course but two or three - whilst we sat waiting for our main course. It took nothing short of a complaint to ensure our main course arrived before we absolutely needed to walk out for our train. They still felt the need to offer deserts, rather than a timely bill, and load said bill with all those nonsense charges like 'table cover' AND 'service charge'. Needless to say we had those removed pronto before dashing for our train. Our advice to anyone considering this restaurant based on it's reputation is to consider your own plans for the evening and lie through your teeth if need be, because theatre goers seem to be the be-all-and-end-all when it comes to customer service.",

(No trainers etc) .As with most of the high end, high profile places to eat \u00a0in London, if you wish to eat before 8PM or after 10.30PM, even on a weekend- the likelihood is, you will get a table.Mainly because most people in London don't eat out before 7.30 or after the latter! Secondly, often if you call to book ON THE DAY when you want to reserve, you may find that due to a last minute cancellation, there is a table free.It's well worth a try, give them a call!",
