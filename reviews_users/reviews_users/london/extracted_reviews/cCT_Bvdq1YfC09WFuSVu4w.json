    "text": "The Thai cuisine is one of my favourites. Something about the combination of their core ingredients, such as lemon grass, galangal, garlic, coconut milk, basil, \u00a0creating a burst of flavours from sweet, sour, bitter and spicy...What I'm trying to say is that Patara manages, so effectively, to produce this melange of flavours which are just too good for any taste bud to miss out on. The food is original and presented in the most inviting manner. I enjoyed their set lunch the other day, which costs about 15 pounds including VAT. Sharing with a friend we had sprig rolls and satays as a starter. The chicken on the satays were as it should be, soft and not chewy, served with a rich peanut sauce. For the main was Pad Thai noodles with prawns and the typical green chicken curry. All were extremely satisfactory. I would recommend to go Asian style and share your dishes as in that way you get to try out a whole host of the dishes Patara has to offer. Oh yes, and for dessert try the mango with sticky rice, it's my favourite, and they do it just right here. Did I also mention that their cocktails are also \u00a0pretty darn good? Additionally, the decor is contemporary and just so inviting. As soon as enter your nostrils are filled with the pleasant scent of lemon grass, which still seems to stick to you as you leave the restaurant.",

    "text": "Easily my favourite food at this price point in London; service can be uneven.The food is just terrific. Rooted in very authentic Thai but with nice, creative expressions in the dishes. Quality ingredients, excellent preparation. It is the only restaurant in London that I make sure to go to every time I'm in town. The \"better\" restaurants I've eaten at here are hundreds of dollars more per meal for two people. While this will likely seem expensive to some, for the quality of cuisine, it is real value-for-money.Food-wise, you can't go wrong. We've tried a dozen or more things across the menu and everything is B+ or better, without exception. The quality is there.For something perhaps not expected, try the different non-alcoholic beverages, they're really yummy. The \"strawberry mint\" drink is a little too sweet but otherwise silly good, it just gulps right down. We tried a Hawaiian drink that had chiles in it and, while really different, was quite good too. Skip the Thai iced tea and try some of these other options down the beverage menu.So, given all of the love, why the lost star? I've never had \"great\" service here and this last time it was pretty poor. The waitress was noticeably distracted, looking off and all around at other things while we were trying to place our order. This is really inexcusable given the quality of food and cost of the meal. Have some humility and diligence, be a professional. Otherwise, you will lose a star for your otherwise very deserving restaurant.",

I liked the variety offered and my favourite was the duck spring roll. The chicken steamed flower dumpling looked pretty, but tasted a little strange. I've not tasted anything like the mango salad and loved the kick it gave. Withe the starter, I had the lychee martini, which was ok, but not the best I've had.At this point we were pretty full, but had already ordered mains. I was undecided on mains. I had the lobster pad Thai in the end (quite pricey \u00a325) and felt that I would have enjoyed it more if not for the starters. It's my first time trying lobster, which was ok, but I struggled to finish. I liked the presentation of the dish, but thought it was over-priced.

The cocktail: I am really difficult in cocktails and honestly they could do better. It's was ok but not as good as what you expect in a fancy restaurant! The platter: that was the best part of my dinner. Fresh, tasty, load of flavours but maybe a bit too expensive for what we had (\u00a312.75 each) \u00a0The main: : I should have actually stop at the starter to be honest! I go for the wok tossed pineapple rice. This is rice with prawns scallops and sea bass. It sound good but up to now I regret my choice! The rice was sticky and look like to be taken from the left over of the pan. It was dry and had no taste at all. They throw some prawns and pineapple on top of this bowl of rice and a piece of sea bass with again NO TASTE! I was soooo disappointed! I am never disappointed with Thai food but this place succeeded in making me don't like a Thai meal! I tried my friend meal lobster pad Thai. Again well presented but not as tasty as i would except for a Thai meal (and that was \u00a325) I rarely give a 2 stars notation \u00a0but thinking about it, the price is so high that \u00a0compared to the quality of the food I cannot give them a better notation. I was expecting a minimum of taste for the high prices we paid !",

    "text": "I've been to Patara probably a dozen times over the last few years. It is consistently the best \"contemporary\" Thai food I've had in London. For price and quality, it's hard to find a better option.The black cod is an absolute must. The presentation is great, but it is the exceptionally rich and complex flavour of the sauce that makes it a must order. The other stand-out is the braised ox-tail---it literally falls off the bone into a plate of utter thai curry goodness. For starters, I usually go with the satay-trio which is comprised grilled marinated beef, chicken, and shrimp skewers served with warmed peanut sauce.Patara has 4 locations in London, but I like the location in Mayfair (Oxford Circus) best---it's a bit less busy than the Soho location yet is a mere 30 second stroll from Regents Street. I always manage to snag a table even w/o a reservation. There is a small waiting area with 2 couches where you can order an Asian fusion cocktail or mock-tail.For higher-end modern Thai, I highly recommend Patara.",

    "text": "Listen to me. Escape Oxford Street. Do not eat at an overpriced, overpacked, poorly-laid out chain. Listen to me. Patara. PATARA. It's a half block away from the madness and 100 percent worth the slight diversion from consumer-mania. My movie date and I were desperate for some food after 2.5 hours suffering through The Master (note: do not see it) and John Lewis on the last day of a sale right before closing (don't do it!)...I quickly pulled up the Yelp app after we decided we didn't want to make the trek all the way back down to Chinatown --- and up pops Patara at .05 miles away. Not bad, not bad little Yelp app. We quickly jaunted over, found ourselves seated in the front window, equipped with menus, napkins laid out for us. The works. Before going further into how absolutely delicious the food is (AND OH IT IS), let me first say that the service was impeccable. So far beyond anything I've seen in London...maybe anywhere. It was 5-star dining experience at about 3.5 star prices. Every whim. I'd barely have to look up and there'd be a refresh of hot water for my green tea, our orders being taken, refills of sparkling water, someone to wipe away the crumbs. Truly spectacular and noteworthy. Looking to impress a date --- bring them here, you'll feel like royalty. OK THE FOOD. It was marvelous. We started with the New Zealand lamb skewers with dipping sauces and the Tom Kha Gai. Both lovely. For mains, I had the Braised Beef in Coconut reduction --- out of this world. My date kept stealing mine, so you know it was good. A nice portion, perfectly tender beef that literally fell apart upon grazing it with a fork. Heavenly, I tell you. Perhaps the best surprise was the dessert. As I'm (TRYING) to be healthy, I opted for the Pineapple carpaccio...which was an alarmingly sized tray of fruit and crushed ice. At first I didn't know what to do with it...but in the end it all worked out. Really nicely chilled fruit on a tray. Beautiful. For about 75 quid total (2 people) it's a bit spendy for Thai food, but worth every penny. This is not divey in any sense of the word (as Thai places often are) and the food is outstanding, matched by the service. Will definitely return and they have large spaces on the lower level that would be fantastic for business dinners or large group dinners... Braised beef. If the Chef has it, order it. Oh and someone please try the sticky rice pudding and report back. It took a lot of willpower not to just sneak that under the table or something...",

    "text": "I've been to two versions of Patara. This one. And the one on Greek street. Both would get three stars and I am too lazy to write two reviews for this one alright place that happens to be in two locations. I mean, it's not that bad. Three stars is decent. I think three stars is a respectable earning.That said, this place was just alright. I came here the other night with the team that I manage in London, for a going away dinner. We had a party of 15 of us. That's all. We sat in a long line and I didn't talk to about 30% of the group all night. A circular table would have been nice but we'd have needed a room bigger than almost any restaurant in Soho.Patara has a set menu and an a la carte men, when you're dealing with groups this large. We were told we could order from both. OK, cool. Then the details came out. You can order from both... but... the set menu is only able to be ordered in groups of 4. And as our group turned out, we wanted 10 set menus and 5 a la cartes. The Patara staff didn't know how to deal with this. It took a while for them to realize that they could offer me the option to buy three of the set menu groups and still get 5 a la cart orders, and we'd be alright. Just a little extra food.Cool. Got it. I figured we'd be all set, but then they server suggested that we move the a la carte people down to one end of the table and the set menu down to the other. They nearly insisted. Everyone was looking around, trying to figure out how to rearrange the seating. I came up with the genius idea to just pass the food around. This is why I am the boss.Other than that, everything was decent. The men's bathroom door was so small, I didn't think I was going to be able to fit through it. So, ladies, don't bring your oversized boyfriend here. He may get stuck in an unsavory location.",

Dishes on the menu all sound quite nice and complex, and even the presentation is certainly to be admired - curries come out with a burner, stir fries and meat dishes in shallow bowls and wide-rimmed plates, rice served in a neat bowl on the side (but costs extra, boo). But the flavors seemed rather heavy handed. Most were oddly sweet and cornstarchy, covering any of the subtleties of the ingredients. Nice upscale atmosphere, but ultimately the taste is just not worth the money.",

The food itself was made well but it wasn't that tasty. It didn't make me wanting to come back again. I wonder if they could add peanuts more and make it creamy texture? In worst scenario they can add peanuts butter to achieve that? It was just like fried noodle and the amount of egg wasn't enough either...I couldn't remember how much I paid but a bit pricy as opposed to what I've got.Coconut ice cream with bit of coconut with coconut flake was the most amazing thing I had at that night.My colleagues had green curry.

    "text": "Having had multiple meals at both this location and the Soho location, I've found the cuisine at Patara to be utterly faultless. Sure, it's a bit of a contemporary/fusion take on a Thai theme, but the flavours are big and bold and the service is attentive and polite. What's not to like?A couple of dishes stand out as some favourites that I keep having to revisit. The lamb shank in red curry sauce with kaffir lime is, in a word, divine. Served on a tray kept heated by what appears to be a tealight candle. The green mango salad with soft-shelled crab may appear small at first glance, but I always find myself shockingly satisfied after sharing with a dining companion. And the pad thai, beautifully presented in a giant bowl with inset serving chopsticks, is so mouthwatering that it's virtually impossible to leave a single scrap behind.This venue is somewhat smaller than the Soho branch, and I'd generally recommend booking a table for dinner. On busy weekend nights, we've been turned away with hours-long waits, but weeknights are more tame.As far as Thai cuisine goes in London, I've not found hugely reliable spots, and Patara is one of the few that has earned my repeat business time and again for being an exceptional experience each time.",
