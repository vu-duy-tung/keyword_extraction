    "text": "I'm definitely a fan of Honest Burger. I convinced a friend at work to hop on a bus to King's Cross to give this branch a try. (Although honestly, it didn't take much convincing.) It's a great location, and with seating both upstairs and down, it's a much larger location than the Soho location I've been to in the past. So that's a bonus.I ordered the special. This month it was the Ribman Special. I always order the special to be fair. I once ordered the Honest Burger and while it was nice, it was lacking something. But the special burgers are usually where it's at (and with their crazy beer burger in March, I'll be going back at least once). The Ribman Special apparently has a hot sauce on it. Quite hot as the waiter felt the need to tell me. I was excited. I love hot food. I'm a spice addict. So I was a bit disappointed when my burger came out with no hot sauce. To be honest, I'm not convinced it wasn't just an Honest Burger. But I asked for the hot sauce to be brought on the side and slathered it on. Heavenly. And I had a ton of it, so I made a nice dipping sauce of Christ on a Bike hot sauce and mayo for the rest of my chips. My dining companion also got the Chipotle mayo on the side. Get that too. It's delish. Honestly, everything is delish.Oh, and apparently they do onion rings now. And not just any onion rings. Smoked onion rings. And they're amazing. And in my honest opinion, they are the best rings I've had in London. They are incredibly crisp, light and delicious. And not at all greasy. I couldn't believe how good they were.So a huge honest thumbs up to this branch of Honest Burger. It's probably the easiest for me to get to at work (a 10 minute bus ride tops, or an even shorter Tube ride as long as people don't mind paying for a Zone 1 Tube ride), and on the weekends, the closest to home. So I'll be back. I will. And the special burgers will be mine. And the rings. And hopefully they do a wicked Bloody Mary like the Soho branch.",

I, for one, am always at my happiest when I bite into a juicy burger to see a hot pink centre of meat staring back at me. Yes, my minimum requirement is that the burger is medium rare and Honest Burgers deliver.I'd been to the Soho branch before, which is much smaller with only around 30 seats. This one is much bigger with seats spread over two floors. They even have a bar area here *shock horror* which comes in handy with the wait times. Like the other branches, there's usually a decent chunk of wait time no matter what time of day you go. Luckily their wait list system is pretty stellar as it all goes through your phone. They text to confirm you're on the wait list and then you can watch your progress through the queue before they text to say your table's ready. So you can either hang by the swanky bar area or go explore the surroundings while your table's being readied. Back to the food now, the sides are good. Rosemary and potato is a killer combination so rosemary chips are a definite plus. And they have onion rings the size of your head so you can't really go wrongDrinks are also pretty solid. I was super impressed when my beer came to my table in a stein. A STEIN DAMMIT. SO COOL. All drinks should be served in steins from now on. tl;dr burgers are gorgeous, wait list system almost makes waiting fun, steins",

The burger was just okay, it smelled a little odd to me, like an 'old' smell, but that could have been the overwhelming rosemary on the fries. I was not a fan of those at all. I like a bit of rosemary in bread or ground up in a spice mix, but these were quite overpowering - and there's no alternative available on the menu. The tea sour was really good, even though I was sceptical over the egg white ingredient. Overall, and I know I'm in the minority here, it was not worth the money I paid.",

Like most other hipster burger joints, they come up with special every once a while, and this time it was Beef, smoked bacon, Honest guacamole, Swiss cheese and Harissa mayonnaise, the spice mixture and the thick texture of the guacamole didn't really worked for me, it was a really heavy burger with a rather odd taste. However the classic Honest has been still as good as ever, well cooked medium beef patty and a great selection of garnishes. Plus the every delightful rosemary chip that is perhaps the best chips you can get at that price level.",

You can still rock up during the weekday lunch rush and get a seat, plus you get served quickly as the service is really good.So how does an Honest Burger rank against the others like Five Guys, Shake Shack, Tommi's and others? Well, let's put it this way, none of them have The Rib Man Burger which features a tasty burger covered in The Rib Man's 'Christ on a Bike' hot sauce. Makes this burger special...and amazing! Their homemade lemonade is quite good and for \u00a31 more, you get unlimited refills.Overall, this is a great burger joint and one definitely worth returning too.

When we were asked for our drink order, we had said, \"Just water, please,\" and they brought an open-topped carafe and a few empty glasses.

Must I say that this has probably been one of the juiciest burgers i've had in a very long time and miles away from home but they did such a great job on making it tasty. I only took a star off my review because the service is a bit slow and the workers who work there do not help you too much, you literally have to flag them down for any assistance. I'm not sure if the reason was because we weren't the native people who lived on this land or that's just how the service here really is. But the food quality was great!

    "text": "Fodmap friendly - people friendly (gluten free burgers!)Ok it takes a significant amount for me to be this happy with somewhere - but Honest Burgers has it for me! Why - because of the below things!1. Menu - Wheat free, burgers and bun - and as far as I'm aware an option for a garlic and onion free experience (take off the sauces). The burger cooked to order - i had a medium rare - and 100% beef i beautiful. Assuming their marketing is correct they have ethically reared meat - which makes for an additional YAY! so.. yay! Also they have particularly tasty chips - the chips are somewhere between a chip and a fry - slee photos! and the rosemary makes them such a delight. Personally I do enjoy a cheese burger so I had the honest burger with Stilton (in addition to the cheddar)2. Service: I like waiting staff to be friendly, sincere, human, light hearted and happy to help. The staff at this place (i've been twice) have been all of these things. Even when I'm unpicking the menu for my perfect order, never are they 'put out' by my awkward ordering, and they are happy to have a little 'banter'. Had a delightful chat about the lack of dessert menu with them - and they didn't seem to be humouring me, that sense they were sincerely enjoying their job. \u00a0In addition to this I must add - myself and my friend miscalculated and thought we'd paid tip - we told the staff the tip was included on the card - and they informed us (they weren't going to but we approached them about it) that we were actually short by 90p and they covered it and not to worry - seriously! I was very impressed - and also appauled that our maths were that bad - impressive, service, and they had covered our 90p shortfall themselves. (We did tip in cash in the end)in terms of atmosphere - casual burger bar - with a gastropub-esque vibe - its not mcdonalds - there is a nice bar, with a good selection - its not 'bar lighting' its a little bit lighter, its always been packed when i've been in, but a short wait for a table.One of my favs as a fodmap free diner",

Just thinking about it, I want one now, but living in Cornwall it's a bit of a trip!An must if in London",

    "text": "Maybe my American roots make me predisposed towards messy, juicy burgers. Maybe my expectations are too high. This is going to be a very unpopular opinion. I've hesitantly stated it to friends before, but it's time to come clean: this burger is solidly average. I guess it depends how you like your burgers, but every time I eat at an Honest Burgers, I just am not wowed by their burgers. Their rosemary chips are divine and the staff is always friendly; the restaurants always cozy. I don't think I'm overly snobby about burgers, and I'd never compare an affordable-range burger to something like Hawksmoor. The problem is this: they somehow manage to make a medium rare burger without any real juice. HOW? Where is the juice and the grease? It doesn't need to be sopping and dripping, but there should be something to it. The toppings are great, especially on the special burgers. I'd gladly meet a friend here for dinner if they suggested it. But if I'm in the mood for an amazing burger? It would never be my first choice. I feel sad to say it, but also relieved to finally be out about it.",

The quality of the meat was amazing, the fries were perfect, and the overall price for food and a couple of pints makes this place well worth it. Not only does this place have great food, it has an amazing service staff as well. Everyone was very friendly and outgoing. They were even very gracious when we asked some typical American touristy questions. We're only here for 3 nights and we might come back. I highly recommend coming here.",

    "text": "Honest Burgers is all the rave in London at the moment. That's why it's hard to get in without a massive wait. I didn't understand why, they were just burgers? This one is round the corner from the man's work, and after a particularly bad day, I decided I needed a burger. And check out what all the fuss is about.Atmosphere:If you're into hipster-y / retro designs - you will love this place. I was actually quite impressed by the level of detail brought into making this place seem simple \u00a0and old fashioned - right into the loos! It gives the place a fun vibe - and I like themes. Service:We did have to wait 20min to get a space, and we waited with a drink. They were friendly enough, but did have to try and gesture to the barman 5min to get his attention for a drink, and 10min extra to order our burgers. Mmpf. I mean there are 5 items on the menu, I was a bit dissapointed.Food & Drinks:We ordered an Ice Tea Sour - that was made as a sour but with bourbon and ice Tea, and served in a jar. You know, the hipster jar with a paper straw. Cute, but tasted a bit meh.In terms of food, I went for their Special - and of course fries. My other half had warned me that what was awesome about Honest Burgers wasn't so much the burger, but more the fries. And he was right. The rosemary fries with still the skin on are TO. DIE. FOR. And the burger was REALLY decent too!Price:VERY IMPRESSED. \u00a35 for the cocktail, \u00a311 for the Special Burger. Good deal, great food.Final impression:I juggled between a 4 and a 5 star - and when going over the price element considering the quality of the food and the effort put into the venue, and despite the small hiccups with service, I decided to give them a well deserved 5.",

    "text": "Another Honest Burgers. You get what you expect: a decent burger with great rosemary chips in a cozy and relaxed atmosphere.The latest location of the quickly growing British burger restaurant micro-chain Honest Burgers is located just a short walk from King's Cross and St. Pancras International stations. And while I have not yet been to the Camden and Portobello shops, I think it is safe to say that their King's Cross restaurant is the biggest so far, it even has two levels with an open kitchen downstairs. The wooden interior gives this branch a nice atmosphere, in line with the other two Honest Burgers I know. If you have been to any other Honest Burgers branch, you will know what to expect. A delicious and solid burger with noteworthy rosemary chips that are among the best in London, I would say. When I went on the opening day, I ordered the excellent Christmas special: juicy beef patty, camembert cheese, cranberry sauce, smoked bacon and rocket. For me, this burger is probably as good as any burger could ever get, cranberry sauce and camembert is a winner combination and works very well with the beef patty and the smoked bacon. I was only a bit disappointed to see that the bun was a bit soggy and basically could not copy with all the toppings, which made this meal a bit more messy than usual at Honest Burgers - not less enjoyable though. In general, Honest Burgers have a simple menu. It is easy to read and without too many options, so you can order quickly. However, they always have some special burgers on and I was told that only the Portobello and King's Cross branches will offer the Tribute burger. So if you're into the Tribute, you now have two locations to choose. Service was friendly, and despite the waiting time before anyone even came up to me to check where they could seat me, I enjoyed my visit at this new Honest Burgers branch. They still do not offer any desserts, and I am not yet sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing. But no matter if you have a sweet tooth or not, I can only recommend Honest Burgers for what they do, because they do it well: burgers.",

The burgers are on the small side but the portion of fries is generous (and tasty). My veggie friend was happy, having spent the previous hour lamenting the soggy portobello on a bun that he usually has to endure. At \u00a310 for a burger and fries it won't be a regular lunch haunt but compared with local street food vendors it certainly couldn't be deemed pricey. Definitely a good option for a cheap dinner and worth the short walk from kings cross if you're waiting for a train. The drink options aren't run of the mill and the staff were friendly.

They've done a nice job on the conversion in a Victorian building on a corner site with a ground floor and basement restaurant. Inside it's simple, clean, feels good.First time trying Honest Burger so was quite excited. Ordered the standard burger without cheese, medium, as recommended by the waiter. A side dish of beetroot and apple coleslaw sounded good and at \u00a32.50 the price is right for a side. A few minutes later the burger arrived in a nice bowl together with plenty of chips (included) along with the well sized side dish of slaw.Yum. It was just right. Everything... The burger itself was great with an onion relish topping. Served medium on a toasted bun, it had everything right. The server recommended some chipotle mayo which was pretty good. Strong smoky chipotle flavour and plenty of heat. The side of slaw was pretty good too and a decent size.Here's a key point of difference for me. This is one of the few new mini chains opening up that actually provides a decent, generous serving size, something which is notably absent from some other new places, perhaps not wanting to risk that you might actually be hungry and want to leave satisfied. I never understand that. Mean portions + high prices are a deal breaker for me, especially for simple, casual food like this.Thank you Honest burger for fulfiling that simple wish. \u00a0The rosemary chips were just great and perfectly CRUNCHY! Some of the best fries I've had.Service was great: friendly, confident, to the point and no nonsense. That's all I want.",

However the sauce in between wasn't my type it is slightly too sweet. The onion rings and salad we ordered were okay nothing special. The burger is really simple and honest just like their name. I do like their homemade lemonade. Service wise, not really impressive. Waited quite a long time for our bill and the card machine downstairs was really slow.",

The rosemary fries are deliciously crunchy and very salty. I had the chicken burger with gluten free bun which was delicious, \u00a0huge piece of chicken and the gluten free bun was soft and didn't taste gluten free at all. My partner had the beef cheese burger which he thought was really good. We didn't order any other drinks aside from tap water and thr total bill came out to \u00a318 which was very reasonable. The service was good too despite the restaurant being very busy. I will definitely be back. Best burgers I've found in London so far!",

    "text": "Would have loved to give 5 stars but had an issue. Great food, our waiter was very friendly. However, my friends mother was a few minutes behind us and was supposed to meet us inside. We were seated downstairs, not immediately visible from the front door. The waitress working would not allow her mother to come inside to sit down with us. Her mother explained she knew we had come in a minute earlier, and although she didn't see us, asked the waitress if we were seated downstairs and if she could look. The waitress rudely told her no one was downstairs (we WERE downstairs) and did not allow her to come inside any further. My friends mother walked back to the hotel alone, without her coat (we had it with us). Meanwhile my friend and I started wondering where she was and even went outside to look for her. We only found out what happened when we got back to the hotel and found her. She was very upset and shaken up with the way she was spoken to. Like I said, great food. Would love to come back but unfortunately will not after being treated this way. Teach the offending member of the staff not to be so rude because otherwise it was a great place to eat.",

    "text": "My boyfriend Ross had raved about Honest Burgers as he previously had one of their special burgers, onion rings and chicken wings while he was in town for the London Coffee Festival and was adamant that I should try it.Even though they have Honest Burgers Locations dotted all over London, trusty Google Maps ensured us that it was only a stone's throw away from Kings Cross. My tired sore feet were rejoicing. Being a Bank Holiday, we weren't quiet sure if they'd be open but luckily they were and were able to get a table without any difficultly. A rare occurrence in London for the most part.The menu is petite, pretty much like the restaurant, but the food sure does pack a punch. I opted for the Tribute Burger (\u00a310) after playing a game of eenie meenie miney mo. My burger was topped with bacon (naturally, you can never have too much bacon, as long as it's crispy!), American cheese, burger sauce, French's mustard, onions, pickles and lettuce. Ross decided to try the namesake Honest Burger (\u00a310) which was topped with red onion relish, smoked bacon, mature cheddar, picked cucumber and lettuce. Our waitress asked if we'd like our burgers medium, definitely. It's the best way to enjoy a burger in my opinion.What I love about Honest Burgers (other than the great ingredients they use) is that all burgers come with fries. Not just any fries though, skin-on rosemary fries. It's a nuisance at times having to order separate fries, or should I say actually remember to. As we were starving and my boyfriend is a human dustbin, we also got BBQ Chicken Wings and Onion Rings on the side.We didn't have to wait long before our food was in front of us. First impressions? It looked rather inviting with the cheese oozing down the sides. Oh boy. I'm currently salivating. Upon first bite, the burger was full of flavour. You could taste the fresh ingredients and as I was battling to not let the cheese drip onto my white t-shirt, I proclaimed that this was the best burger I had ever tasted. High praise indeed. I may have had my mouth full of juicy burger goodness at said time as well. The beef did all the talking, the combination of toppings were icing on the burger cake. It was divine. A joy to eat. A little pet peeve of mine is when burger restaurants ask how you'd like your burger cooked and what you get in front of you is not what you asked for. If they state that their burgers come medium or even recommend it themselves, ensure it is medium and not well done. Luckily, Honest Burgers get it right. It was perfectly pink.Mid burger munch, I tried the skin-on rosemary fries. Perfectly seasoned, these fries were crisped to perfection. Marvellous. Not too crispy, not too limp. I loved the addition of rosemary which was different to the norm you'd get at other burger outlets. I couldn't get enough of them. Cheesy thumbs up from me!Sadly, I was a little let down with the rings and wings, which I hate to admit. As I bit into an onion ring, it was rather watery which in turn made them slightly flavourless. The BBQ Chicken Wings on the other hand were nice but a little underwhelming compared to the burgers. I adore chicken wings, but I just can't pinpoint exactly what was wrong with them, maybe the tangy sweet BBQ sauce?My boyfriend who has ordered both of these sides in the past even admitted himself that they were \"different\" this time. Both were edible but not as rememberable as the burger. It's hard to fault a place when the staff are so friendly, attentive & always had a smile of their faces. I loved the d\u00e9cor and the chilled out relaxed vibe. Prices weren't as expensive as I thought they were going to be and unlike some places I've eaten in, there was no rush to get you out the door as soon as you had finished your food. The food, for the most part, was superb hence the high overall score and I would honest-ly (heh!) go back in a heartbeat.Now if only they'd open in Glasgow.... until then, see you soon Honest Burgers",

The venue is split across two floors, but it's much cosier downstairs. Staff are friendly and the food is very nice. In a Byron type of way it's simple and classic.The rosemary fries as everyone say are a must. The rest of the menu is simple, burgers are a choice between chicken or beef. Okay 3 options. There's a veggie burger too that at the very least looks tastier on the page than many other veggie burgers look in cooked form. So there's that going for it.There's a special brunch menu with a few more items on it. I've not had anything from it, but think of things like steak, fry ups and granola.",

The special of the day-beef burger, double smoked bacon, smoked cheddar, sauerkraut, sauce, seasoned fries, and a choice of a 1L of lager or darker Oktoberfest beer. Simply yummy-highly recommended. The burger surprisingly good-it was honestly a great burger! The fries are moderately seasoned which I enjoy, although my purist kids likely would say they are too salty. The service was also splendid. The clientele and staff is largely youthful. Im glad other reviewers also recommended it as I otherwise wouldn't have known about this gem.",

For \u00a37.50 I can't really complain, a filling meal that comes with hand-cut chips, though I would loveee it if Honest Burgers came up with a few more adventurous vegetarian options! Sometimes I don't feel like so much fried food...I will continue to eat here when I feel like something that is probably not all that healthy, which doesn't happen that often fortunately.",

The burger itself had good flavor, better than a lot I've had in the states!The only knock is that it cost me about 11 pounds, or about 17 dollars.

It might just be me but I feel like their burgers are on the smaller side. This may be due to the fact that I am always starving when I eat here so I plough through the burger. But said burger is absolutely delicious and the portion of chips definitely makes up for my perception anyway. I'm also a fan of including the chips with the burger instead of being a separate side you have to order. I always leave this place full and happy. Plus the lemonade is the best. Proper American style homemade lemonade yum!I've only ever been here at lunch when there are plenty of tables available but they have an awesome basement seating area with lots of cool booths. This is my favourite location because 1) it's kind of close to UCL and of course Kings Cross and 2) on sunny summer days the sunlight just streams through all the windows making the most pleasant, joyful atmosphere anyone could hope for. Especially if you get to sit in a booth by the window. Try to snag that seating next time, not only can you people watch (or car/bus watch because wow is that street busy) but I promise you the lighting also makes for great photos!",

The lemonade is lovely and refreshing, the coleslaw is really nice, the chips... Well I guess if you love chips with rosemary then they're pretty good, but the burgers... The actual burgers... I left half of mine because it literally made my tastebuds bored- yes BORED. There is nothing special about these burgers... Even the one I had last night which was called \"The Special\"... Nothing that makes this burger stand out, no complimenting tastes or textures, just felt like a block of chewy overly salty rubber in my mouth. I love burgers, but this is simply NOT on my must-eat list.",

I love my burgers and would try as many popular burgers as possible.This place reminds me of Bareburger in New York where they have an established brand name in the city with their signature gourmet burger. The buns were soft and the meat was juicy. The rosemary fries were done to perfection- flavorfully crunchy. I got the honest burger with bacon and was afraid it was too much protein. It wasn't. The portion was substantial but everyone at my table finished their burgers and fries with a smile.Order their limeade or lemonade if you want an nonalcoholic drink to pair well with your burger. Unlike your standard lemonade, it's only slightly sweetened, which surprisingly goes well with your fries and burgers.Service was standard, maybe slower than normal but hey you're here for your burger so patience will do you well!",

The staff manage the queues well and our table of 5 was seated swiftly.We shared a selection of starters, the best of which was a trio of battered sausages. I also liked the spicy chipotle mayo, which was a good foil for the generous bowl of crispy fries, which came with the burgersWe all went with the Brewburger, consisting of a beef patty topped with beer candied bacon and beer BBQ sauce in a brioche bun. It was nice but I was relieved that the beer flavour didn't really come through as I'm teetotal. The beef patty could possibly have done with a little more seasoning tooThe lack of a dessert menu meant that we left in search of dessert. However, this is one of the better burgers chains in London town",

Holidays in the states you can still eat, you can still have fun, you can still see any form of living. So when I came back to the area I ordered takeout. The guy with the mustache, who I'll just call Mr. Mustache, was cute. I ordered with him. I wanted a lemonade to go but they didn't have to go cups. I waited quite a while actually. Almost 20 minutes for a burger and chips. I took my food back to my room and the chips were hard and unappealing. The burger was good but the bun didn't hold up. It was quite soggy and depressing. The staff was cool but that food for 10 pounds needs improvement. Or maybe I need to dine in. I'll go with the latter and just try them at another point.",

    "text": "The advantage with restaurant chains is that you can always expect the same quality ...Usually ... but apparently not always at \"Honest Burger\". During the last eight months I have been to this chain more than once, in detail two times in this branch. Which concludes that I really like the food in general. The service has always been very friendly in other restaurants of this chain.Unfortunately, they failed here both times!When I came in today I found it rather disappointing that they refused me to choose a seat, although 90% of the seats were neither occupied nor visibly reserved. I would have liked to sit by the window, but this was rejected by the staff.The burger was very soggy and the fries did not taste at all because they were way too dark and charred. Apart from that no one appeared to ask if everything is alright. So I had to go to the counter to ask for the missing fork.When paying by card at the end (without my approval to use it \"contactless\") I was asked to enter the tip amount (while the lady was watching what I did). In the restaurant were 5 guests and 7-8 people staff at this time.On both visits, the restaurant was remarkably empty, which is rather untypical for \"Honest Burger\". Maybe I am not the only one who has faced similar experiences.Admittedly it must be stressed, however, that the decor of the shop is very nice. therefore I give two stars in this case instead of only one.",

The meat was juicy and flavorful, and the flavors all worked together perfectly. The rosemary fries- to DIE FOR!! My husband ordered the honest burger, and he enjoyed every bite. We ordered a ginger ale and lemonade, and we were surprised that the lemonade was carbonated. It was fine, but not described on the menu. Food is definitely worth coming back for. If the rating was on service alone, that would be 0 stars. When we entered, we were treated by a friendly worker who seated us. Menus were handed to us immediately. That was awesome. But then we waited....and waited.....and waited. My husband even went up to the bar and asked if we order at the bar or at our table, even though we watched other tables order from a server. After 30 minutes (no exaggeration- I was watching the clock on the wall) a server came, a blond woman. We gave her our order, and then proceeded to wait again. After 20 minutes, she brought us our drinks, apologizing for the wait in getting the drinks. So after waiting 50 minutes, we finally got our drinks. Our food was brought out shortly after, not even by our server, and we happily ate. When we finished, another server cleared our plates away. We never saw our server come to us again. She would go downstairs and disappear for quite some time. We waited for our check, but it wasn't brought to us. Watching other tables, we saw those servers get their checks from their servers. But we did not. After another 30 minutes (again, not an exaggeration because I was watching the clock), my husband went up to the bar and asked if we could pay. What should have been a much quicker dining experience turned into almost 2 hours. Completely ridiculous. So, if we lived in London, we would not return to this place. There are plenty of other places to get a good burger.",

I ordered the Honest Burger with a side of chipotle mayo, and my dinner came with a plate of rosemary salted chips. Our server was incredible - friendly and attentive. We arrived at just the right time so it wasn't busy, but I can definitely see this place filling up quickly. There are a few shared tables and plenty of bar space though, so a wait wouldn't be too bad.

I tend to go for the Honest Burger (beef, red onion relish, smoked bacon, cheddar, pickles and lettuce) with a gluten-free bun, and I haven't been disappointed yet. Their specials are often exciting, too, but I'm not a fussy person when it comes to a burger - I like them pretty simple.The fries are crispy, and deliciously light, too.",

We were around king's cross station looking for a good place for burgers or fish'n'chips, so we decided to go there.They have 10-12 quid burgers, that is ok because the quality is quite good overall. So, if you're craving for fast food, near the place and the waiting is not too long, it worth the visit.",

The rosemary fries hit the spot just right and you don't have to worry about what sides you want as it's all there for you. The lemonade is a good choice if you want something non alcoholic but I tried the Botanic gardens and it didn't fail to hit the spot! Good venue located just around the corner from Kings Cross station so if you're feeling peckish or looking for a good hearty burger I totally recommend! Reasonably priced great for friendly catch up over some good food!",

They have other sides and varieties of burgers, but my eyes were on their classic. \u00a0Keep it original and keep it simple.Servers were nice and at this Honest Burger location, they have a downstairs as well for dining.",

We weren't sure if we'd get in at a peak time, but we were seated downstairs immediately and had prompt, friendly service. We both ordered cheeseburgers, with a side of fries to share and \u00a0from the time we sat down until we paid our bill, it was probably 30-35 minutes. Pretty speedy! Granted, we ate like our lives depended on it because we were trying to make a comedy gig across the way at Invisible Dot, but regardless, the food was fast, hot and delicious. The buns were fresh and brioche-y, the burgers juicy and flavorful. Mine was a bit on the rare side for my taste, but that can be a matter of preference and I finished it without a second thought.I'd definitely recommend popping in here!",
