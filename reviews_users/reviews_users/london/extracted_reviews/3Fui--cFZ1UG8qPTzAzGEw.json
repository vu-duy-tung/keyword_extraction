Nothing impressed me! The drink(elderflower fizz) tasted too sour and artificial (could not taste the Elderflower at all), the sesame butter does not do the grilled mushrooms justice. The crispy piglet belly was too fattening and the salad that was served with it tasted like it was coated with sour lemon juice. In general, the whole meal tasted too sour and too much like lemon that you could not really taste the food at all! Will not come back again!",

    "text": "I have been wanting to go to Flesh and Buns for aaaaaages! And I'm so very happy that my birthday was the perfect excuse to go there with my favourite people in London :)I am a massive fan of Bone Daddies, and this place did not deceive.The atmosphere:Flesh and Buns is an underground treasure in the middle of Seven Dials. It has a kind of \"industrial\" feel to it, and you are greeted by some Anime and Japanese ads at the entrance. It's fun, it's bussly, it is however a bit noisy. There were little touches that made a lot of difference to the overall experience in terms of decoration and service.The service:The service was just right - friendly, smiley, no over service, and extremely helpful. Yes, because I am a bit of a service snob, just so that you know.The food - because that is the important bit:I was really impressed by the overall quality of the food - extremely tasty. well prepared and original. I personally went for:- Rice crackers as an appetiser - very tasty, perfect pre-dinner snack- Avocado/Salmon rolls - I was nicely surprised with the quality of these since it's not their speciality. Better than some sushi places I have been to- Duck leg and the buns - you kind of make your own tasty sandwich in some steamed buns. I loved the concept, but my duck was a bit dry - shame. (The sauce however... om nom nom)- and the desert... THE DESERT. We ordered a MINI BONFIRE on which we could grill or own marshmallows, and then we sandwiched them between some japanese biscuits on which there was some green tea chocolate that melted mixed into the marshmallow. Oh my days. that was amazing. You need to get that when you go.And finally. The Sake. A lot of Sake. \u00a0Nice to know:- Mondays have Buns and Beer deals for \u00a315 - you however have to make a booking and precise it while you book.- There is some very tasteful tentacle porn in the bathrooms. Gear up your phone for a sexy selfie! Overall:- A great place to go for a special occasion with friends. Good food and fun, for something different.- We spent \u00a340pp - but had nibbles, starters, drinks - you can have a decent meal for under \u00a320- Why 4 stars? Because of the noise, maybe a bit because of the dry duck, and because I don't want to be too easy on giving out great stars. If we had halves, it would have a 4.5.",

    "text": "What is the perfect accompaniment to Bruce Springsteen's Dancing in the Dark raised fist shoulder waggle? Solemn enjoyment of Guns n Roses' November Rain? Eyes skyward, head-tilted renditions of Elvis' Are You Lonesome Tonight? Tip-top Japanese food in a casual environment, that's what!Located in a basement in Covent Garden, Flesh & Buns is the new restaurant from Ramen supremos Bone Daddies. The idea is Japanese food, but in less serious setting. I'm all for that! My meal here wasn't entirely typical. Thanks to the eagle eyes of Katie B, I got to go with Robyn J on a soft opening offering 50% off food. So the food was significantly cheaper and it was clear that in some cases the wait staff were still finding their feet.As 'Flesh and Buns' suggests, the mains here centre around meat and steamed, slightly sweet buns. But with a rather pleasant kicker - the mains are large enough to share between two, allowing immediate and adventurous exploration of the various sides. Most of the food on the menu appears to be Japanese, but there's some Korean stuff too: Robyn and I snaffled some Kimchi and rice, vegetables and sauce in a hot granite bowl i.e. what was to all intents and purposes a Bimbibap. Speaking of which, I really enjoyed the food. We kicked off with some sashimi which was pleasant though not extraordinary. No matter, because from the mains onwards the standard upped. The buns came in a bamboo box, accompanied by some lettuce, the meat and dressing. We went for braised pork belly and a honey and mustard dressing, and the combination was tasty and filling. The sides were spectacular: the broccoli was quite possibly the best I've ever had, lightly steamed, crunchy, served cold and in a delicious vinegar-based dressing. We also had some similarly-prepared green beans.which were almost as good. On to desserts, and though quite full, I had to take full advantage of the 50% off. Robyn went for the donuts, which were delightful. I had a Yuzu Meringue Pie, a heavenly mix of a cheesecake biscuit base, what seemed to be light custard, raspberry sorbet and flecks of meringue. Absolutely delicious. I could have stopped there, but determined to forge ahead, plumped for the three scoop sorbet: mojito, raspberry and strawberry. Wow. The mojito sorbet has to be the best representation of that drink outside the drink itself that I've had. The other two flavours were also strong, but next time I'll probably substitute one of them for another mojito.Elsewhere the service was friendly if occasionally slightly scatty and the drinks we had - shiso and tarrogon soda and (I think) Yuzu and Raspberry presse were striking and inventive. Oh, and the music was memorable too :-).So why four rather than five stars? Well, I can definitely say I'm a fan, but the experience of the soft opening slightly blurs my appreciation. Obviously the 50% off the food won't last, and while some food remains good value (the sorbet, one mains between two working out at around \u00a310 each), others are less so (some of the desserts and sides in the \u00a37-\u00a38 range). The service was slightly erratic too: some dishes didn't arrive but were placed on the bill (though quickly removed when pointed out) and in some cases they appear to have given us more food than should have been the case (i.e. four buns instead of two for the mains). So I feel I'll need to return in a few weeks time when everything's settled down for a better view of the Flesh and Buns experience. But based on this evening, I'm feeling optimistic.",

The small sides were mostly good; I found the salmon \"sashimi\" (more of a carpaccio, I think) and seafood ceviche a bit lacking in punch. The mains were excellent. The duck leg was perfectly cooked, with a crispy skin and flaky meat. The sirloin was also amazing. In fact, we could have done without the bun. Finally, it was great fun to grill the marshmallows for the smores but the chocolate fondant was definitely the star of the dessert. All in, a great deal for \u00a349 per person.",

It seems the concept was to take pieces of everyone's dish from fish to duck to steak to lamb and make your own little sandwich with salad and pickles.We all felt that this was an interesting idea but one that left us a little uninspired as the dishes didn't arrive at the same time \u00a0due to lack of room on the table (we had a table for 4 and we were only 3). The dishes were also fairly small for something priced normally at \u00a317 - \u00a324 but the food itself was tasty. I had the sirloin steak which was presented medium rare (no option given to alter that) . We also had the salmon and the pork chops all of which had eastern pickles such as kimchi or ponzu. While the steak came sliced and the salmon flakey there was no such option with the chops. Ripping apart a pork chop with chopsticks is no small feat!The starters were some beautiful salmon and tempura prawn rolls all very well made kicked off with a couple of cocktails, again very well made.We had an enjoyable evening but did feel that the place was a little expensive to return to with the sharing concept still needing some ironing out.",

I think they spread themselves thin by offering Korean/Japanese/Chinese food (should focus on one).We went here for a business meeting and the food was absolutely delicious. The steak was AMAZING, the salmon was only good with the sauce, and the vegetarian options were great (broccoli, fried potatoes, etc.). The fried calamari was probably the best, but it was super small so make sure you order the right amount of portions.You must order the buns to wrap the meat in. It's like 2 for 2 pounds. Unfortunately, it's literally just a bun that you wrap the food in. Normally you use these buns for peking duck wraps with some hoison sauce, but they didn't provide any sauce.Water here was quite pricey as well. We asked for still water, but apparently you need to state tap water if you don't want to pay 10 pounds for water!The SUSHI here is probably the worst. I'd recommend you avoid ordering any sushi - was just not good. The Korean Wings were also meh.Overall, our bill was about 60 pounds/person. A bit pricey, but the food was worth it!",

The decor itself is ok, bit plain and unwelcoming. We were greeted by a waitress who seemed quite welcoming but her demeanour changed throughout the meal to mild annoyance (not sure why) As there were three of us we went for three different bun fillings (duck pork and Beef) the food was actually pretty good but.... they give you two buns and enough meat for at least 3 buns. you can only buy buns in pairs! ( I think you can see the obvious con) The price wasn't bad for Japanese food (which in any form is always overpriced.... Ramen, traditional or sushi (lucky its tasty) )I will no doubt return but I would like to see some changes.",

    "text": "Flesh & Buns, despite the somewhat off-putting name, is a delicious eating experience and a testament to the growing popularity of hirata buns first introduced to London by Yum Bun. The Bone Daddies Boys (B(D)ad Boys?) have now set up shop in, or rather under, Seven Dials to serve up a range of dishes with one main standard component - the steamed bun. The menu is fairly extensive and you have a choice of hot and cold starters, various sides, about a dozen mains, and of course dessert. The cold starters are your typical Japanese ones - salads, sushi, sashimi, and tadaki. The hot starters follow suit with an array of fried squid, chicken yakitori, and so on. We opted for both of the beef and tuna tataki (lightly cured thin slices of meat), the broccoli (cold), and some grilled asparagus (hot). The tataki were excellent with the meaty flavours being enhanced by the crispy onion ponzu and the melt-in-your-mouth tuna punctuated by tiny balls of puffed rice. One of our friends had raved about the broccoli being the best he's ever had. I've got to say that he wasn't far off on that claim as the tender long-stemmed Chinese broccoli was perfectly cooked and served with a creamy and spicy sauce. I don't normally say this about veggies, but I could have done with more of that! Our mains took the form of duck confit, pork belly, sirloin steak, and fried sole. Each was served with four buns, a bowl of veggies to be included in the bun, and a different sauce for each dish. Now I know there has been some contention with the number of buns served, but we got 4 buns per dish without asking so I'd hope that was the norm. Four buns seems to be the perfect amount for all but the pork belly and if you really need to, you can always order a few more (albeit for \u00a32.50 a pair). The standout was the duck confit with its tender, juicy meat and crispy skin. I'd easily eat more of that in a heartbeat and there was a bit of a kerfuffle over who got to gnaw the bone for those last few bits. The fried sole was also excellent with a flaky flesh that came apart at the lightest touch. I would have liked a crispier batter those as on the whole it felt a bit limp. Despite stuffing ourselves on Flesh & Bun's...well...buns, we decided to opt for dessert. The crsipy bananas were three tiny pieces which couldn't have made up more than half a banana altogether. Fail.The sundae on the other hand was brilliant. Matcha ice cream with blueberries, blackcurrant jelly and honeycomb presented in defined layers made for a \u00a0beautiful dessert that tasted even better than it looked. At \u00a37, it was about 10x the size of the banana dessert and tastier to boot! Overall, a bit too pricey to be more than a once in a while thing, especially when you can get some tasty buns from Yum Bun for \u00a36 for a pair.",

    "text": "Obviously you have to try the flesh and buns. Quite pricey for what it is, but if you go on Monday nights they have \u00a315 flesh and bun deal (pick your filling of choice from the entire fillings menu except for a couple of the wagu beef options) and a print of Asahi. That then makes it great value! The beef sirloin and the vegetarian fillings are spectacular. It is strange that the portions of the fillings are much larger than the two buns that you get per serve for \u00a32. So you end up ordering another serve of buns, bringing the total cosy of buns to \u00a34 which seems a tad ridiculous (especially if you go on a night other than Monday!).",

    "text": "Flesh and Buns was such a mixed bag for me. I came here for Teresa's birthday/leaving party, and I was really excited because I'm a huge fan of boozy brunches. I was looking forward to the cocktail, the starters, and the buns (because I really discovered this type of bun and was really excited to try some others.)First of all, there are some really good things about this place. I think those good things end with the starters. Most of the starters were pretty great. The tataki was delicious, the korean wings were outstanding and the soft shell crab was really tasty as well. Some of the skewers were good, but not great. One big problem is that the train the servers to be really obsessed with not letting you order food. There were eleven of us. We ordered two of every starter. They looked confused as we were ordering too much. I would get that if there were only two of us. But there were 11 of us. Some of the starters (the prawns) only come with three prawns, so ordering four of those for eleven people shouldn't seem weird. But for them it was. Even though the menu says \"unlimited\" they really try to monitor the amount of food they'll bring you. We never saw the sashimi come out. I assume it's because it's more expensive so they didn't want to give it to us because we were a large group. I don't know. It was just frustrating. The buns were okay. Nothing special. I've had better ones in London to be honest. The meat was mostly overcooked (really dry and hard to eat duck) and the pork was tasty, but definitely not as soft as I like my pork belly. They gave us 16 buns for eleven people. That's not even two buns per person. I think we ordered more buns, but I'm not convinced they ever arrived on the table. Desserts were alright too. The best for me was the black sesame creme brulee. The doughnuts have a weird texture, and I wasn't a fan. It was fun to make S'mores at your table with the fire they provide, but the S'mores themselves are a bit sickly sweet as they use a green tea white chocolate instead of a darker chocolate which is the necessary balance to sweet, sugary marshmellows. The fondant was just the wrong texture. It just seemed wrong to me. But the thing that really let the place down is the venue and the service. You're sitting in a massive hot basement (and it was really hot in there, I don't think the fire for the marshmellows help) that has no soundproofing at all. So it's just loud. So loud you can barely hear people sitting directly across from your table. Your table that is also a massive communal dining table. I'm not usually a fan of them, and it's even worse when you're in a restaurant that the servers don't know where the communal dining areas begin and end. We were a group of eleven sitting next to a group of two. The servers were completely puzzled where to put the food. Was it ours or theirs? Well considering it's three or four plates of the same thing, I assume that they would realize it was the big group. Nope. I can't tell you how many times they came by and were completely clueless about where the food went. Most of the servers were also really surly. It was unnecessary. I mean they probably have problems with people ordering too much at brunch every week (if that's a problem, don't offer an unlimited brunch), so they just run around looking annoyed at every group sitting there. That makes my meal experience terrible. Also unlimited drinks? Not so much. It was hard to get a server's attention to have them refill the glasses. While it's cheaper than some other unlimited brunches I've been to, at least at the other places my glass was always full. It was nearly impossible to get refills. And the Bloody Mary I had on arrival was pretty bland and boring. I also wasn't a fan of the Hentai wallpaper in the bathrooms. I don't really want to see naked drawings when I'm peeing. It's off-putting. I don't know who designed the place, but they failed miserably in every way. Loud and hot and off-putting bathrooms. And communal dining. It's like the worst combination of everything in one restaurant.So while there was some good food on the menu, I was under-impressed by the whole experience. It didn't seem worth the \u00a336 at all as they really didn't want to give us food or drinks and treated us terribly. Apparently that's acceptable these days, but I won't be going back.",

That sauce was absolutely delicious! Slight kick but it was all good :) the mains were delicious too. We had the pork belly and the duck leg.

The open kitchen is on one end, a (very) small bar on the other. On either side of the long table are booths and round tables, we ended up at a table.We went as a group of four, and I would say this place is best enjoyed if you can share both appetizers and buns so you can try as much as possible! We opted for grilled corn, chips and dip, tempura rolls, fried squid and (because the version at Bone Daddies excellent) soft shell crab. Corn = excellent. i need to order corn on the cob more oftenchip & dip = good but not a must-try. tempura roll = great, hit the spot for my roll cravingcrab & squid = good though i was getting a full at this point and only had a tasteFor flesh and buns we went pork belly and duck belly (though \"healthier\" options include salmon and sea bass). I have never had a steamed bun so I had no idea what to expect. They were fluffy, warm, slightly sticky and ever so slightly sweet. The texture is doughy, like the uncooked dough they look like -- it sounds awful but it is not in the least. Once piled with the fresh pickle, lettuce and cucumber, and add the savory meat the and sauce and it's like heaven. Really.Unbelievably, we added dessert to our order, going for the donuts and of course the smores. The smores were popular and nearly every table had an order -- I can see the draw as it's a different and interactive choice, but I wouldn't get them again. The donuts were nice but next time (if I bother with dessert at all) I'll get something much lighter like the sorbet.In all, our bill for 4 including a couple teas, mocktails and one glass of wine, as well as service charge was \u00a3120. Not bad considering how much we ordered and everything we got to try. Well worth a try for your next meal out",

I enjoyed our meal but was out off by the price. The space is also quite noisy and the communal seating doesn't work. You are elbow to elbow with the person next to you and too far from the person across from you to have any sort of intimate conversation. The staff won't let you sit next to one another to solve this problem because it screws up their ordering system. A pity because the seating just doesn't work. Ask to sit at the bar if you can.

The field mustard and spicy chicken were tasty enough for London foods. Buns were too sticky and beef were not cooked enough for medium. The prices were not that reasonable.The place is too noisy to talk to other people even in your table. Unless you like very busy and noisy place, I would not recommend to go there. Also one of the things I felt uncomfortable is that they use Japanese porno comics for a wallpaper in restrooms.

We were seated in a table for six that we eventually shared with two more people, for all tables are to share if your party isn't large enough to occupy it all. So, Flesh & Buns: as well as starters and smallish courses to choose from, the idea is that you pick your main (chicken, steak, duck, pork, salmon, veggie and a few others) and have it served with optional steamed buns to make your own tiny Japanese...sandwich? For lack of a better word. The food is really really REALLY good. We had an array of starters and smaller plates to keep us occupied whilst waiting for a friend to join us, and that included sashimi, a salmon and avocado sushi roll, grilled mushrooms and a few other bits. I ordered the young chicken for main and it was so tasty and tender it complemented the steamed buns beautifully. I'd really love to go back, it's been a lovely dinner out.I just wish it were a teeny tiny bit brighter and quieter. But that's just me being fussy.Oh, one last thing. Don't order the miso soup.

It was a bit tricky to find at the beginning as the sign is not clear as like similar restaurants on the same road. However, walking down the stairs I was showed into a large table and was told we might have other people sharing the table! No problem Now we ordered couple of starters and one main dish - as the waitress insisted that one order is enough as a main course for two!!! Well, we got out one-dish main course before the starters !! Finished the main which was good for one person and not two!!! Had the starters after asking three times Then we were still not full so had to order another main of flesh and buns !!!

It was flavourless and I didn't like the pickled veggie it came with. The mains were the highlight of the evening. The buns are as yummy as what you would get at momofuku and then some. The flesh, we went for the flatiron steak - outstanding. But the crispy duck leg - a bit dry but doable. Last came dessert and we decided on black sesame creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e because I love black sesame. And this dessert was loaded with it. I enjoyed it but takes a bit of getting used to.

Happily, this couldn't be further from the truth - this is a delightful, ambient and trendy new restaurant with great staff and delicious food.The concept is simple: the menu revolves around a choice of meats including steak, piglet belly and salmon (or satayed aubergine for vegetarians, which is absolutely delectable) - served with a recommended 2 \"buns\" per person. These are Japanese-style, steamed and served in dim sum baskets - with a consistency nearer to dumplings than bread rolls. All of this is served with salad, pickles etc for you to make up your own \"burger\", and is absolutely delicious. Of course, there are also other menu options.A second (and very popular) star is the s'mores, found within the dessert menu. The classic marshmallows served between Graham crackers also come with green tea-flavoured white chocolate, and your own fire pit over which to toast them. Your only complaint will be that you could have eaten the whole \"sharing portion\" by yourself.The staff are friendly and the atmosphere is buzzing. Some of the seating is bar-style, and the restaurant is located down a set of stairs, so definitely worth asking for assistance if accessibility is an issue. The pricing is very reasonable - we paid around \u00a330 each for a 3 course meal, a shared bottle of wine, and including a service charge. Will definitely be returning!",

    "text": "For Izakaya in London, it's hard to beat Flesh and Buns. Note that the concept of Izakaya comes from the word \"i\" (to stay) and \"sakeya\" (place that sells sake). In Japan, it's the kind of place you drop by after work and drink your night away before the next day of work. In London, it's just pure gluttony.Prices are steeper than the average fare but I would say its worth it. For a starter + flesh and bun + 2 buns + drink, it comes to around \u00a335 per person, the same amount for the tasting menu. You must try the Sake, and make sure you press the waiters to give you more detail if you don't know how to taste Sake.I dined with a party of 2, and were sat on the long sharing tables. Although we sat shoulder to shoulder with others, there was plenty of space, and the place was loud and bustly enough so that you couldn't hear what the other people were talking about.Service was prompt, and food came out VERY quickly. I had the crispy duck leg, which, upon asking, is cooked twice: once in a 90 degree soft cook, then the second time in duck fat rendered in a grill for 5 minutes to heat up. The meat was soft and moist.Buns were OK - I would follow their recommendation for 2 buns per person.",

The owners started the very popular Bone Daddies Ramen restaurant and then I guess they decided it was time milk their brand for all they could and get in on the popularity of bao (ignoring the fact that bao buns are not even Japanese, they're Taiwanese). The result is a zero-elbow room restaurant, packed with people eating very over-priced and under flavoured food. It's like if McDonalds opened a Japanese restaurant.",

    "text": "Update Sept 8:So the current price is now \u00a342, menu cut in half (with less exciting options), prosecco not as tasty, and credit card required at booking. \u00a0I still stand by my 4 stars experience at the time, but a shame the menu+price has changed!======I've been here twice now: once last year for dinner (when they just opened), and just recently for their new Sunday brunch. \u00a0I didn't review F&B the first time around, but essentially, I thought they had some good menu items, the pork belly with the bun was just a bit MEH (which I think should have been the star for dishes like these).. overall, good but pricey and I didn't think I'd have a reason to come back. Until they launched their unlimited boozy Sunday brunch. \u00a0Yes. They totally redeemed themselves (on the value factor), everything was tasty, and I would encourage anyone to go. This is a review of their FIRST DAY LAUNCH of the Sunday brunch, so items or quantity of items might have changed since then.The menu is divided into 2 menus: \u00a329, or \u00a336 for everything on the first menu, plus double the selection. PAY THE \u00a37 - and you will get prawn tempura, whole deep fried softshell crab, fresh mixed sashimi, amongst other things. \u00a0It is so worth it. \u00a0You can order any unlimited hot & cold starters, and each person gets 1 order of the main (choice of any flesh & bun). Our group of 10 wanted 2 of every item so we could share. \u00a0But our waitress recommended that every person order their own starters, and that they were generously sized. \u00a0I think she was thinking we'd each order 2 appies. \u00a0WRONG. \u00a0We each ordered our own things (so lots of doubles), but we ended up sharing everything anyway - I think we ended up averaging about 5-6 dishes per person, and we had even added on more items before our mains arrived. \u00a0Anyway, if you have a group, I do recommend everyone order as a group to share rather than their own. \u00a0The food was so incredibly good, I had zero complaints on the taste or quality of this stuff. \u00a0I admit, the first time I came last year, it was good but needed work, but the stuff I ate the 2nd time around - wow wow wow! \u00a0Hot/Cold starters from the brunch menu that we had (and I included quantity sizes per order): - korean wings (5-6 pce)- * assorted sashimi (6 pce per order)- * softshell crab (1 whole crab)- * chilled brocolli in yuzu dressing (generous size bowl, SO INCREDIBLY YUM)- * Grilled corn w/ chili lime butter (what seemed like 1 whole ear sliced vertically down the middle and into thirds) - japanese squid- chicken yakitori (3 skewers)- grilled asparagus (3 skewers)- shitaki mushrooms (3 skewers w/ 3 mushrooms)- * mixed seafood ceviche- * tuna tataki (6 slices in a coriander sauce)- * pumpkin tempura & prawn tempura (5-6 pce of LARGE PRAWN per order)I've included the quantity per order (and we had several orders of each one), just to show that they aren't skimping down on the portion sizes, and its incredibly generous. \u00a0I know the manager thought our group of 10 wasn't going to finish it all, but we did :) \u00a0All items were good, but I've starred the ones which I think are an absolute must-try. Onto the mains, we all got our own main meat item with 2 buns per person (you can add on more buns, free of charge). \u00a0I had the lamb chops w/ kimchi spice, which was my favorite. 4 chops with juicy and tender meat, slathered in a Korean sauce, wedged in a bun and topped with greens and pickled carrot. OH YUM. \u00a0Andrew ordered pork belly, and I must say, I am SO MUCH MORE IMPRESSED with how the belly turned out this time around. \u00a0Both were delicious, but I really loved the lamb. Now onto dessert, we had smores and chocolate fondant for the table, and, I clearly only remember the s'mores, b/c I was blown away by how fun and tasty it was. \u00a0A generous sized flaming pot is brought over for you to roast your marshmallow (seemed like it was made in-house), which you then wedge between a thin graham cracker and a thin slice of green tea fondant. \u00a0It was gooey, sticky, and it was so good. As for drinks, you start off with Kimchi bloody marys or a strawberry bellini, then you can go for white, red or prosecco for the rest of your meal. \u00a0 \u00a0Service was a slow and lagged to start with, but it was the first day of their brunch service - they were nice and accommodating,said that we could stay a bit longer, brought out edamame and chips w/ dip for us to nibble on (don't fill up on this), and were very good about keeping our glasses topped up. \u00a0I felt like a goof for breaking one of their water bottles to the ground, but they cleaned everything up. \u00a0My mouth has been watering this whole time I've been writing, and I wish I could go back to London to eat this (and I'm currently back in Vancouver, where we do have excellent fish and Japanese food). \u00a0Thats how good it is! Their underground space WILL cut out your phone signal, but not to worry, ask the waitress for the password",

    "text": "Note to the reader: my review is based on a visit I made six month ago (I kept it in the drafts a bit longer than expected) so maybe things have changed, and I really hope so because I don't wish to anybody the bad experience I had._________________________________First things first: I hate this place. I think it has been my worst food experience in London EVER.Coming from the amazing experience of Bone Daddies I was really looking forward to try this place and I came here some months ago with a bunch of hungry friends. And with this I made three mistakes in a row.1st mistake: don't come here if you're hungry. \u00a02nd mistake: don't bring more than one person with you.3rd mistake: don't think to compare Bone Daddies to this place.Portion are ridiculously small.That kind of ridiculously small that is okay for a gal that has a food blog, it's tall like a model and wears a size 8, but, you know, she eats A LOT.When I ordered some (EXPENSIVE) maki I got a plate with an odd number of TINY rolls. Now, since when maki are served in odd numbers? I want back the roll that you kept from me. I don't care if a missing roll makes the arrangements of the others \"oh so fancy\" I want to eat and I want to make sense to that totally unjustified price tag.We were 5 at our table and when the waitress came to take our order she was horrified that we ordered so much food and tried to dissuade us. Because portion are big. You can imagine my face when the food started coming in, but priceless was the face of said waitress when we called her to order more food because \"we thought it was more\". I think she still has nightmares. Food came in a totally random order and as other reviewers said some people got their food so late that the others were already done with their meal. So much for a classy restaurant. Regarding food quality: it was okay, but really nothing special and nothing to justify the ludicrous price tag, the rudeness of the staff, the pretentiousness of the venue. It's like a \"Sushisamba In A Basement With Buns\" that went wrong.So, a word for the wise: come here if you want to bring a skinny girl out to impress her with a overpriced meal and barely being able to listen to her because of the loud music. Don't come here if you like the quality of your food to be in line with its price, if you are thinking of the generous portions and tasty food of Bone Daddies, if you like polite and professional staff.",

She decided to have an all you can eat blow out before she left at flesh and buns! It was disappointing to say the least- the concept is great on paper but it doesn't seem they could manage. I mean the food came out intermittently and it didn't seem like they could manage a big table. Service was slow! The food didn't wow me- it was fresh, but nothing really stood out except for the green tea s'mores because of the aesthetic value of the fire that came with it! The green tea white chocolate and the home made mallows were very good but got sickly quick, I would have probably paired a dark chocolate with streaks of the green tea for that pop! As per Grant's review- the kimchi Bloody Mary was a fail. Stick to the free flowing proseccos! All in all, I really wanted to like Flesh and bun s but the execution left more to be desired.*also what is up with the Japanese porno walls? I can't pee with that in my face. It's uncomfortable.",

They also have fab desserts like s'mores where they bring you a little fire to cook them over.The place itself is quite cool, it's underground and has interesting pictures in the men's toilet (the ladies was busy at the time!). It's also super central so very easy to get to. Will definitely be heading back soon for another brunch.",

I got the teriyaki salmon and buns which was divine, and my friend got the duck and buns...which I was eyeing all night. It kind of reminded me of a Japanese version of fajitas because you fill the bun with sauce, meat, greens, and pickles to your liking. We started off with the california roll and the spicy tuna roll, I would highly recommend the spicy tuna roll.The restaurant is quite large and has booths, tables, and a long communal table. The ambience is a bit on the darker side and at a medium volume, but I did not have a problem hearing or talking to my friends. I would really recommend this place both for a special occasion or for a fun dinner out with friends. Before I even got my main dish I was making plans to come back!! A must try!",

The ceviche and shishito peppers app were very tasty and we loved the assembling our own buns. We tried crispy duck (a must have if you're here) and eggplant. I thought the accompaniments went perfect together, with great mixture of sweet/savory flavors and different textures.

New to London can make you hesitant about whats going to impress you, with so many options to try and opinions differ quite a bit compared to NZ.If you want a fun atmosphere with sharing plates this is the place to go. instead of choosing the baos based on fillings, its more of a DIY. Choose your \"Flesh\" - pork, steak, salmon, etc all amazingly cooked with a burst of flavour and served on the side a small bowl of lettuce and shaved cucumber. Fatten or skinny your bun as your choose, the buns are soft like pillows and served warm in bamboo steamers.If you're not hungry enough for buns, opt for the delicious tapas. The ceviche is fresh and vibrant, although I am quite bias when it comes to salmon. The dish i would recommend for everyone to order is Korean fried rice. Its served in a sizzling hot pot, and your waiter will mix it at your table, where it gains this amazing crunchy bottom or top I should say. For my birthday I treated myself to the smores for dessert - maybe not quite Japanese, but great idea. If you're not afraid to get messy then its a little fun.Overall I can't complain about the food, I just think the service could use some enthusiasm. It would be nice if they could crack a smile. Its a shame the staff are a bit arrogant, because the food and the bustling atmosphere really makes up for great evening.RatingFood: 9/10Service: 6.5/10Value for Money: Very Good41 Earlham Street, London WC2H 9LXOpening Hours:Mon-Tues 12pm-3pm, 5pm-1030pmWeds-Fri 12pm-3pm, 5pm-11pmSat 12pm-11pmSun 12pm-930pm",

This place has some of my favourite wings in London (they're the same at Shakfuyu and Bone Daddies fyi) Ever so slightly crispy buffalo style with a Korean edge, dusted in sesame seeds and delicious! Add a couple of sushi starters and the nachos-meets-prawn crackers style chips and dips for the perfect beginning to your meal.As for the buns, wow. Fluffy steamed bundles of joy, just waiting to be slapped with soy sauce and stuffed silly with the perfectly cooked meat of your choice (my favourites are the pork, duck or teriaki salmon) Scoff! It's really easy to overdo it here and end up as stuffed as your buns, ouchy! If you can though, try and save room for some table-top fire-pit smores. Really.Check out the tasting menu and the brunch deals too!It's underground in the arches and can get pretty loud and busy, but it's a fun atmosphere.

    "text": "Flesh and Buns used to be a favourite of mine when I visited this cool little location to try their new brunch menu some months ago.At that time it was bustling but relaxed and staff were friendly although clearly stretched. The brunch menu was a wonderful array of starter quality dishes that I found to be well presented and deliciously diverse in taste and texture. The price for the full menu of unlimited starters, unlimited prosecco one main and one desert?... \u00a336. Bargain. We therefore decided to book again this weekend and found that they now required a credit card number at the time of booking. \"Hmmm must be popular\"...I thought. Unfortunately we arrived to find that the menu had been reduced by at least half and the price raised to \u00a342! (Now the credit card at booking nonsense suddenly makes sense). Giving them the benefit of the doubt I decided to try it anyway. I was saddened to find that the wonderful mini mains had been replaced with what dull overly salted bar type dishes. Veggies, once flavoured with hints of lemon zest and what I thought was five spice was now covered in an odd soy bbq sauce of some kind. The prosecco too had been downgraded and was now flat and more similar to house white wine.The mains were only ok but again flavourless and the crispy pork was decidedly fatty. I asked to bring my steak home in a doggy bag and was told, \"we don't do that here\". I could understand if I'd asked to bag up one of the unlimited starters but you can only have one main, so it's already been paid for! They were apologetic but inflexible, so instead, my main went into their bin.The staff whilst still friendly were difficult to get hold of and prioritised the bellowing chef in the kitchen area who seemed to get angry if wait staff hadn't arrived to collect food within two seconds of him shouting \"service\". Literally two seconds. I counted.The one saving grace was the desert. We opted for smores and were pleased to find that this remained deliciously unchanged. Although they had clearly reduced their little bowls of fire to last only 90 seconds. Several tables had to ask for it to be relit so they could finish roasting their marshmallow. This was so ridiculous it took away from the magic of the experience somewhat.All in all, a disappointing experience. I left wishing I'd just gone to Cook Book cafe...",

    "text": "Well, having been back to Flesh & Buns at least on 3 other occasions, I am proud to present to you my findings. You MUST visit this place for one of the following:-1. Beer & Buns Mondays \u00a315. You get something from the buns menu (excepting the Sirloin and Ribeye), and you get Asahi beer (or soft drink). Trust me this will fill you up and keep you happy, or you can go for dessert after.Yes, see my pictures, you can have the amazing amazing matcha sundae with fruits within, or you can have the smores which is more a gimmick as you would usually only try this once and leave it at that.2. Sunday Brunch - all you can eat starters and then buns with drinks. We went for the more expensive version \u00a346 and made sure we ate our worth. The slightly weird part is that the sashimi came in tiny portions on a huge bowl of ice so we had to keep ordering it. The soft shell crab was so nice we were doing our stomach a disservice by trying to cram more stuff into it, but otherwise gosh we weren't about to go to another buffet for months to come!! Parents and friends were suitably impressed!Also my latest forage into this restaurant gave a lasting good impression. It was on a Tuesday, my free film preview didn't have enough space, it was raining, for lack of anything better to do I speed dialled (joking, had them on phone book) for a booking and they booked me in for one hour later although I told them I would be there in 15 minutes and they said just turn up and they would try to accomodate us. Accomodate us they did as they had some spare tables at around 645pm and the lady manager even mentioned my complaint last time as she had a note on her system and asked about it. I WAS IMPRESSED.INTERESTING THING TO DO: Go to toilets before you leave. The girl toilets are more interesting. Take a peek if it's not occupied boys. Yes, I was shown a paranoma picture of the boys' :D",

However the portions are huge.I highly recommend the sushi option, salmon crevich and the korean wings - all three were prepared perfectly. The sushi tasted fresh and flavoursome. The salmon crevich, delicate and tangy from the citrus and the wings spicy and sticky with a good crunch - one of the people I was with couldn't get enough of the wings coating.The main courses we had (all served with two buns, sauces and salad) were crispy pork, salmon teriyaki and duck. Again, all excellent. The crispy pork was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of fat and crackling, served with a tangy sauce and slices of apple, this made for an incredible bun feeling.The salmon was both crispy and soft from the well cooked skin and delicate flesh. And the Duck was fantastic, crispy skin and very flavoursome and came with a great tangy plum sauce.The service was also top notch.A good experience had by all.Yes, it's slightly on the expensive side, but you'll leave feeling ready to explode with tastebuds fully satisfied.",

    "text": "In an area with an abundance of food options, Flesh and Buns offers a very decent and reasonable offer for a relaxed but fun dinner. The two of us booked a couple of weeks out for a Friday night but they do offer walk-ins. On sitting down the menu is vast and full of excellent options. Sushi or Ceviche is a must here, we got some salmon and avocado rolls which were delicate but so tasty, some of the best I've had in the City. Next up was a pickled platter, the waitress actually said that this is rarely ordered and goes under the radar, but for \u00a33 it's a perfect time holder between main dishes. The platter was about 4 separate options, one of which was a beautiful beetroot and cauliflower bowl. Tangy but really went well with the fish. Next was nothing but flesh and nothing but buns. The soft, stretchy and chewy buns a came in all there glory, ready for our sticky fired chicken to be placed in. More than excellent tastes were flying about. We had 2 buns each and left feeling more than full. Id say this place is worth a trip with a booking, great Thursday or Friday location with a couple of mates. And given the amount of pubs around, an excellent opening a swell central London night.",

    "text": "I came here on a Friday night with two friends, as we were looking to grab a bite somewhere central and this is conveniently located off one of the branches of Seven Dials. I hadn't realized that it's run by the same people as Bone Daddies, but once you get there, it is quite evident with their co-branding (everywhere it says Flesh & Buns, it says Bone Daddies as well). There are a number of seating arrangements available, as there is a high elevated table running down the length of the restaurant, which my friend thinks would be quite good for a date, while we were seated nearby at one of the round tables, and there are a number of booth tables as well.As for the food, for starters we got the softshell crab and the chicken yakitori. Both were very good. In particular, the softshell crab came with a great creamy sauce that we liked so much that we kept it to use with the other dishes. For mains, we ordered two meat dishes, the flat iron steak and the piglet belly, and got 2 buns each, which is the perfect amount. Both were delicious and came paired with sauces and a selection of vegetables and pickles to put inside. I'm not sure if it is the intention, but this style of eating is exactly like Taiwanese street food, but with a twist on the meat!Overall I'd say that Flesh & Buns is a solid restaurant experience, in a great location and has a very young, trendy vibe going on. It's not as cheap as a bowl of ramen, but it's not too bad for London standards. Also to note, there were a number of tables around us ordering the s'mores, which comes served with an open flame so you can roast your marshmallow yourself. That looked like a lot of fun!",

    "text": "We went for the recently launched all you can eat Sunday brunch offer at Flesh & Buns. \u00a0There are 2 brunch menus at \u00a329 and \u00a336, both include a welcome cocktail, unlimited prosecco/red&white wine, unlimited hot/cold starters, a main each and 2 types of desserts to share. \u00a0If you go for the \u00a336 menu you can choose dishes from both menus (see the 2 menu photos for details). \u00a0It is worth paying the extra \u00a37 for which you can order unlimited sashimi, soft shell crab, prawn tempura and tuna tataki.For non-alcoholic drinkers the available drinks are somewhat limited. \u00a0You can only choose bottled sparkling soft drinks ie. coke, lemonade or ginger beer. \u00a0The servers reason for not allowing green tea is that it is too labour intensive to serve?!! \u00a0I presume the other non-sparkling soft drinks are also excluded as it would be too labour intensive to dispense a glass!As a substitute for the welcome cocktail they do allow a choice of blended fresh juices. \u00a0My choice of the 'sweet symphony' - a mixture of lychees, blueberries, raspberry syrup and lemon was nice and refreshing.The server recommended choosing 2 hot/cold starters per person and told us we had over ordered when we chose our dishes. \u00a0We proved her wrong and ordered more, we managed to finish an average of 6 starters each. \u00a0For starters we had the following, I have noted the better dishes with an *:*Tuna Tataki x2*Yellowtail Wasabi RollYellowtail Sashimi - this was far too salty *Mixed Sashimi set x4 (note that 1 portion includes 6 tiny pieces of sashimi)*Grilled Asparagus - the sweet miso and sesame sauce tasted really good*Pumpkin Tempura*Softshell Crab x2*Prawn Tempura*Salmon SashimiBroccoliMixed Seafood CevicheChicken YakitoriKorean Fried WingsFried SquidMains - Flesh & Buns*Sirloin Steak 200gLamb Chops 4 piecesGrilled SeabassOf the 3 mains I preferred the Sirloin Steak. \u00a0The seabass was very disappointing, the fish was dry and overcooked. \u00a0Although the lamb chops were alright they were far too fatty, once all the fat was removed there was not much meat left. \u00a0I would have preferred the buns to be prefilled rather than to make DIY buns, but I was told that I was just being lazy by a dining companion :)For dessert we chose the s'mores and black sesame creme brulee. \u00a0It was fun to toast the marshmallow but I found the combination of the toasted marshmallow sandwiched in between 2 caramelised biscuits and a matcha chocolate to be sickly sweet and really messy to eat. \u00a0Now that I have tried the s'mores I won't be ordering them again if I return to Flesh & Buns. \u00a0 \u00a0 Overall the dishes we tried from the brunch menus were tasty although some were just average, whilst the seabass main was distinctly below average. \u00a0Unless you go for the brunch offer or pre/post theatre offers Flesh & Buns is way too overpriced for what you get eg. the mixed sashimi containing 6 tiny pieces of sashimi is normally \u00a312 on the a la carte. \u00a0I could have easily finished the 4 portions that we ended up ordering.",

Try this: Smattering of Japanese rolls, Korean chicken wings (tho Korean friends suggested a pass after a disappointing experience) and, of course, the Chinese \"bings\" which are the buns in the restaurant name.Crispy duck legs & crispy piglet belly were amazing w/their specific accompanying pickle. Broccoli were indulgent w/a light sauce & fried shallot garnish. Spider rolls, salmon avocado rolls and yellowtail Hamachi were small and ok. Fun passionfruit marshmallows for roasting tabletop for homemade s'mores. Fun to have the Italian waiter at a British owned pan-asian restaurant explain to 3 American girls how to make a s'more.Surprising accommodating to children since I had my toddler niece but they didn't have booster seats.

    "text": "Flesh & Buns is the new hot spot from the creators of the Soho hipster ramen joint Bone Daddies. Hidden off a side street in Covent garden, you walk down stairs underneath a large screen showing the latest in Japanese anime and enter the underground cavern that is Flesh & Bones. The dining \u00a0room and small bar was buzzing---almost deafening! Actually that's why I gave Flesh & Buns 4 stars and not 5 stars---the acoustics are dreadful it was so difficult to hear my dining companions over the loud boisterous crowd and the even louder techno-pop music.However, the food more than compensated for the ringing in our ears. The menu is a bit difficult to decipher, but offers a selection of shareable small warm and cold plates as well as the main events - Flesh and Buns. The later are a mixture of meats, that you make your own mini sandwiches with the buns, salad, and sauces provided. For starters, my friends and I split the asparagus (very tasty), chicken yakitori (good but small), soft-shelled crab and sashimi. The sashimi portion was tiny and served in a comically large bowl for 6 pieces of fish, but was among the freshest tasting sashimi I've had in some time. I need to learn where Flesh & Buns source their fish! As for the main event, we had the duck, pork belly, and steak. All were great, in particular the steak was amazing, expertly marinated and grilled. We had the pleasure of shredding the duck and pork ourselves, and both were stand-outs...I'd order them again for sure.You get 2 \"free\" buns with each meat order, however, it's not really enough. We found up ordering and extra 4 as the meat-bun ratio was insufficient on the bun side.Desserts were good, though not as good as the mains. My friend's sundae disappointed...down to the spoon being too large to fit in the sundae bowl. However, the make your own s'mores over an open were pretty epic and clearly the way to go to cap off your meal.All in Flesh & Bones is a great new hip spot in Covent Garden, really cool interesting twist on Japanese food. Just bring earplugs and an empty stomach!",

    "text": "A boozy Sunday brunch has long been a New York institution but slowly its making its way across the pond. I love a good 'sunday session' - you really can't get a better Sunday than an afternoon of eating, \u00a0drinking and catching up with friends in London and I've now found the perfect place to do it.Over in Covent Garden, the people behind Bone Daddies have really hit the nail on the head with Flesh & Buns and their Sunday Brunch offer. For \u00a339/46 you get to choose unlimited small dishes from their set menu (the more expensive option gives you access to both menus), \u00a0a choice of 'flesh & buns' for your main course and dessert - plus unlimited red/wine wine or prosecco.Being the fine (read: greedy) eaters we are, Tom & I went for the \u00a346 option so we could sample as many dishes on the menu as possible. 'CHIPS & DIPS' came up first - like a Japanese nachos! Rice crackers served with avocado shiso (like a guacamole) and a tomato jalapeno relish followed by a bowl of miso soup each.Fried salt and pepper squid - addictive and probably my favourite dish....Softshell crab, spicy tuna rolls, California rolls and edamame appeared....The Korean fried wings (delicious) and chicken yakitori (didn't really do it for me) were eaten before I even got a chance to photograph them! By this time, my waistline was bulging and I was getting a bit tipsy from the Prosecco! The waitors whirl around you topping your glass up constantly and you're welcome to reload the dishes as many times as you like - but bear in mind you still have two more courses to come! Once we'd admitted defeat our 'flesh and buns were brought over'Pork belly being my favourite dish, I went for the piglet belly with mustard miso sauce and pickled apple - oh, my god.Top tip, save room for pudding (easier said than done)....DIY SMORES! Complete with your own little fire.... I had such a fun afternoon - the food is incredible, the atmosphere is relaxed and lively and it's brilliant value for money! Get yourself down there, you'll love it!",

    "text": "I love the ideas here. Love. If you had to summaries all the flavours that I adore, the Bone Daddies family would sum it up. I loved it so much, that I came twice in the first week, once for the soft opening, and again a couple days later at full price. Flesh and Bun shares similar themes to Momofuku Ss\u00e4m Bar in NYC.I think this place will do well. Hip space and vibe, with a mix of tables, booths, and communal high table seating, exposed lightbulbs with interesting filaments (those are so trendy these days!), and industrial concrete walls (limited mobile reception warning!). The drinks are interesting and well-balanced (plus, they have great non-alcoholic beverages as well, which I appreciate), so it would be a good place for cocktails in addition to a full meal. It is fun to eat with your hands and construct your own buns. The various elements of spectacle, namely the mini fire pits for the S'mores are festive and fun. On the whole, the food was excellent, though I do think the menu needs a BIT of refining to single out the excellent dishes from the ones that were 'just fine'. Plus, some dishes are what I would consider reasonable value, while others were overpriced for what you got. It was this inconsistency that, for me, makes it 3.5-4, not 5 stars. Both times, unlike other people, we got 4 buns per bun dish (one was a party of 3, the second time a party of 4). But there seems to be some inconsistency about this. In my opinion, the best dishes that were worth their price were:-Tuna Tataki-Beef Tataki-Duck Buns-Broccoli-Asparagus-Kinakao Donuts-SundaeThe one thing that was BORDERLINE was the sirloin steak. I really liked it. But it is a tad spendy at \u00a322.Dishes that were really tasty but way too much money:-S'mores. Was freakin delicious. But only 2 marshmallows. \u00a38 for 2 little marshmallows and a bit of fire???? So tasty, but so not worth the asking price, even with the spectacle of the fire pit. -Crispy banana. It was such a disappointing and pathetically small amount of banana (not even a half of 1 banana!) that it was too small to share and just, well, sad. And just rather cheap of them, tbh... we all know what a banana costs and if frying it and a little sorbet make up the rest of the cost, well, they need to rethink something there.Good, but not quite there:-Fried sole - not different enough from fish and chips fish and not crispy enough.-Grilled sea bass- fish itself was good, but a small piece. Salsa seemed like a non-sequitor. -Braised pork belly- Good. Just... not quite there. Something needs changing. This dish should be spectacular, not just fine, as it seems like the obvious go-to on the menu for the more traditional-style bun dish. I can afford to go to Bone Daddies on a regular basis. Maybe if I worked in the City I wouldn't think twice about going to this place a lot, but unfortunately, as much as I liked the food and the space, I won't be able to come that often, at least not in a big group. Maybe if I just came with one other person and got 1 appetiser and 1 bun dish to share. But with my group of 4, we easily spent \u00a330+ per person with only one beverage.",

    "text": "Despite living minutes away from this place, I hadn't seen it until I was perusing Yelp earlier today. The actual exterior is rather unassuming, and leads down into the basement where the main room is. I went with my boyfriend, who is decently picky about quality food, and we both thought the food was very tasty.We split a fried squid appetizer, duck leg and piglet belly \"flesh\" mains with two buns each, and a black sesame cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Although it was quite pricey, I have to say it was worth it. The fry on the squid was awesome - completely dry and not greasy at all, with a good pepper kick. The server mentioned that he thought the piglet belly was the best dish, and he wasn't wrong: deliciously rendered meat, crispy skin and spicy mustard sauce to go with it. The duck leg was also tender and my boyfriend preferred that one, but it was served lukewarm. The cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was my favorite though - warm cream, cold ice cream and crispy corn flakes. That dish was a home run.I can't give it five stars because some of the mains came 10-15 minutes and I can't see how they were cooked to order in that time... so some of it wasn't piping hot and fresh. I also wasn't a huge fan of the long communal table for all of the two-tops; it was fairly wide and difficult to talk across the table when there are people right next to you. The ambience was dark and a bit loud but in a good way, as long as you expect that. Service was fine, not bad but nothing to write home about.TL;DR Very good food, decent ambience/service, but rather \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3.",

Also if you run out of buns, wrap the meat in the lettuce they give you for a lighter option.As for drinks they were fine. We had the lychee martini and I forget the name of the other.Overall, all this food can be found in Chinatown for much much less.",

The s'mores at the end were a nice touch too.The sushi, chips and dips, and tuna tartare were a bit of a letdown. Flesh & Buns was good but I'm not sure I'll be returning, especially when Shackfuyu is only a stone's throw away.",

Immediately I was asked, so politely, if I could wait just a minute. Of course, I could. Within 4 minutes, I was gently gathered and walked to the back end/service area of the bar. The host immediately went to the lead bartender and, without any dramatic attention, seemed to ask him to take special care of me. I saw a deferential but cheery nod and a moment later I was being poured a glass of wine (I had been asked on the way what I'd like to drink). \u00a0The place was jam packed. Wall to wall, and seemingly standing room only - even at the bar. Yet, within 5 or 6 minutes I was seated at the bar with a clean and well-set place setting. From there, I merely asked the host to choose some light fare for me. He asked my likes/dislikes (the latter of which I have few), and off it went from there. Had the spicy wings and the pork belly with steamed buns. So delicious. So worth the hike from Westminster, and so worth the trip if you're willing to make it - and as raucous as it seemed to be for a Thursday night, it was still worth it for this introvert.",

It was getting close to my time leaving London, so I felt like celebrating and treating myself a little. Downstairs is very dark and almost club-like with loud rock and roll music. It is softened with industrial/rustic decor and warm lighting. The place serves japanese cuisine, in case you forgotten by now, but it doesn't really matter. If you are a single person you will likely be seated on a long communal table. I was approched quickly by a good looking and friendly server and placed my order for aspargus salmon sushi roll, crispy duck leg and a glass of white wine. Salmon roll was very skimpy and didn't impress me with flavor, but the crispy duck was outstanding! The skin was crispy and meat moist and full of flavor. You can put shredded meat inside the wonderful buns that came on the side, together with other small condiments. As far as wine, my pour was a little modest, I must say.Looking around the place was filled with posh and good looking crowd. I would gladly agree to come be here again, perhaps even check out their all you can eat brunch on Sundays (where my favorite duck legs become ordinary and unlimited item- they were so good, I would come back just for this by itself).",

Personally, I think we were a bit too close to the others but it was quiet enough to hear each other across the table. Service was quick and effective and we waited less than 10mn before starting our dinner. Salon/avocado and king prawn tempura rolls arrived first, soft and well sized (\u00a36/\u00a37). Then the fried squid, looking good, crispy and slightly spicy lemony, loved it (\u00a38,5). Then we shared a delicious set of crispy piglet belly buns, hot and melting in our mouth! \u00a0We were told that a set of buns + 3 small dishes would be enough to fill our belly and it was true. Couldn't manage to fit dessert after this full meal! I was looking forward to the passion fruit and chocolate s'mores. We drank our cocktails (frozen yuzu margarita and lychee pomegranate martini \u00a39 each) and went on our way, full and satisfied! We paid about \u00a350 for two, starters, meal, drinks.

Which would've been fine, except that we were there on a sort of special occasion and the table was slightly too wide across to talk to each other comfortably, made harder by it being deafeningly loud in there. Like that thing that starts with one loud person that subconsciously makes everyone else talk louder to drown them out and there's no way of lowering the volume again? I mean why have such sexy red decor and low lighting, and then make people sit closer to the strangers on either side of them than their dining partner opposite?!What can I say, we resorted to making eyes at each other across the table (and well, basically shouting) whilst enjoying a good feed. I could stick almost anything in those fluffy white buns and enjoy them, so their 'recommended two buns per person' seemed quite an underestimate to me! As far as the 'flesh' goes we had the crispy piglet belly (which was tender, delicious and served with a mustard miso) and the flat iron steak (which just didn't work as it was far too chewy to take a bite of it from a bun). So we ordered half right at least! I loved the way they served our sake of choice too, from a carafe on ice in a mini crate.The romance factor wasn't quite what I'd hoped for then, though the service was great and it's a beautiful place to look at. The brunch offer caught my eye for another visit - but I'll definitely be more specific on where we'd like to be seated next time!",

I was surprised that the sushi was pretty good.I ordered two duck buns for my main and the duck was dry and the sauce was tasteless. The buns were hot and nice and squishy, but how can you screw up buns right? I think I should have tried pork or steak. I was somehow expecting it to taste like Peking duck maybe? High hopes.It's a fun environment. Feels like you're stepping into a night club haha. I might come back.",

Only full price brunch at 39 pounds with a welcome cocktail and free pour prosecco. The amount of food that came was insane! We couldn't finish it all. The crispy duck and bun was our favourite. The service was good as the server came around often. It's a nice treat. But more value with the express menu!",

Terribly Rude from the beginning, food didn't come until hours later and missed out on several orders. Did very little to remedy this and continued to be rude throughout. Tried to smile and be friendly but the server was insistent on making our lives difficult. This would be fine if the prices were not expensive - but they were. Overall: go for the food, leave for better service. Totally ruined the evening for all. P.s. this is a live report",

    "text": "Having been to Bone Daddies Soho,\u00a0 Bone Daddies Shackfuyu and now Bone Daddies Flesh n Buns twice,\u00a0 what is clear to see is that the Bone Daddies group can produce unique and inspired combinations of food that are well presented and boast a variety of textures and flavours. The decorations throughout the restaurants are similarly themed and successful in creating a sense\u00a0that you are dining somewhere esteemed and exotic.\u00a0 However other consistent factors apparent in all these Bone Daddies creations is that the seating can be cramped,\u00a0 the service abysmal,\u00a0 the drinks diluted\u00a0 with ice and the prices a bit higher than necessary. Here is the meal I had at this visit of Flesh n Buns: The Sweet Symphony mocktail drink was a beaker of ice interlaced with a few blueberries with minimal volume of sugary drink lining the bottom. The grilled sweet potato with spicy mayo starter was a pleasant surprise - sweet, spicy and tangy with a soft melt-in-the-mouth texture; an ingenious combination. The half young chicken was a sizeable portion of succulent chicken with a dash of pickle on the side. The buns remain a highlight of the meal; as an avid bun lover I can assure you that these buns are great - soft and delicate when warm as well as fragrant and a good size to handle and fill. (Better than the Yum Bun buns. )As a side-note the toilets certainly leave an impression; they are plastered with indecent\u00a0 manga cartoons of topless girls exhibiting and/or cradling their breasts - such are the most x-rated wall decorations\u00a0 I've ever seen for sure! \u00a0 In short,\u00a0 Flesh n Buns is a place of highs,\u00a0 lows and the somewhat bizarre;\u00a0 worth a visit if you love buns and fancy an intriguing dining experience.",

    "text": "My best friend and I planned a girls day out combining visiting the Vogue exhibition at the National Gallery followed by the \"Bottomless Brunch\" offer at F&B. I was very much looking forward to this, but wasn't hopeful it truly would be \"bottomless\"! I was very happy to be proven wrong! Despite a slightly slow start after our welcome cocktail, we asked our waiter if we could move onto the prosecco and after that he made sure our glasses were never empty! The Sunday brunch deal really is amazing value, \u00a339/\u00a346 per person (the more expensive option allows you to choose from more of the menu). You can choose as many small dishes as you like, we went for the \u00a346 option and the choice was vast! My favourites were Korean chicken wings, chicken yakitori, soft shell crab with jalapeno mayo and the AMAZING grilled broccoli with orange miso. Then it's time for the eponymous flesh and buns, we had sirloin steak and crispy duck leg which you stuff into soft pillowy (but VERY filling) bao buns along with salad leaves, pickled accompaniments and bbq or plum sauce. On both occasions I've eaten here we've agreed that the crispy duck works best against the soft texture of the buns, the steak tastes better just eaten alone. All the while the prosecco was being topped up and we were getting steadily more merry! As the piece de resistance, dessert is brought out - a generous platter of their delicious kinako doughnuts, perfectly runny chocolate fondant with matcha ice cream and the infamous S'mores! My friend's face when she saw how we would toast the marshmallows was priceless. We never felt rushed or table-turned at all, the offer states a two hour limit on tables but we did end up staying almost three hours. Brunch is highly recommended.The only reason it is not 5/5 is while I feel the brunch deal is excellent value, it's quite pricey when dining a la carte - e.g. you have to buy the buns seperate to the flesh at \u00a32 per person. I think the first buns should be included in the price of the \"flesh\". People concerned about the decor in the toilets - this place is not child friendly anyway to be honest, it's dark, loud and rock n roll and to me is not where i'd take kids. I personally think the pictures in the bathrooms are a good talking point and are part of Japanese pop culture! I will definitely be back, but probably just for the Sunday Brunch.",

First issue we were given the wrong side dish, the waitress told us we had ordered it, untrue. One person at dinner asked which desserts were gluten free to which the server said to order the sorbet. When the \"sorbet\" arrived, it came in the form of doughnuts, clearly the wrong order. The server insisted that we ordered the doughtnuts and couldnt accept that she made the mistake. To wrongly accuse us was simply insulting. Despite the good food, shall not be making a return visit anytime soon.",
