Chewy fish cakes (hard to pry apart even with a meat knife) and summer rolls (the rice paper was more like a thick leather) were only the beginning of a terrible meal. When we dared give our server some constructive feedback and politely, she became immensely defensive and said \"this is how we serve them and there are a lot of customers who like (chewy leathery) summer rolls\". She basically rolled her eyes and walked off. Absolutely no desire/care for our opinion or even to feign concern. The chilled lemongrass tasted like they have some very very old produce/inventory and was also left untouched. A few people in our party were vegetarian and there was no effort put into asking for dietary requirements (pretty sure the tofu in the salad was fried in fish oil). When we asked for chilli/sauce/spices, the server literally slammed a glass of chilli oil on the table and said she thought it probably could have fish oil--she didn't know (or care). Awful service, terrible food, and a tragedy to call that Thai food. Never again.",

We were a birthday group and we were quite jovial. We were not drunk or wild, but a couple came over after they had paid and told us that we were too loud and ruined their evening. They would not accept our offer to buy them drinks and stormed out. Shame.",

It's all just a bit well..bland tasting mostly of coconut milk with none of the additions like fresh herbs e.g. holy basil or pea aubergine that would really make it sing. There's also no chili on the table that you can use to pep it up and if you ask for it you get charged extra. It's also quite a lot more expensive than our local Thai with most curries coming in around the \u00a310.50 mark. For more authentic Thai I would recommend The Churchill Arms (I know it's in a pub but trust me all the chefs are Thai!) or Yelo.",

    "text": "I went to Rosa's for a quick lunch today and the cafe is easy to miss, it's all black outside. I have walked past Dean Street many times and did not realise there was a Thai Cafe here!The first thing that immediately impressed me when I walked in alone was the smiling Thai lady at the back of the restaurant. That was the welcoming anyone could ever hope to receive! Service was attentive, quick to take orders, quick to deliver orders, and quick to clear dishes away once it was obvious we were finished.I ordered their thick red chicken curry (less chili) and Thai iced milk tea. The curry was pretty sweet tasting and not really chili anymore so I was content (but don't say less chili if you want it to still be noticeably spicy) with rice. The sauce is very nice and the chicken pieces are a decent size.I loved the iced milk tea, it was not too sweet and came in a big jar with a straw, value for money right there at \u00a33!My lunch mate ordered the Fresh Summer Rolls, this was a bit disappointing as there was nothing crunchy enough inside to counter balance the limp outer wrapping and the vegetables inside. It also came with the sweet and sour dip rather than the peanut dip.My lunch mate ordered some sort of veg salad with less chili. There was almost no chili which made the salad too sweet to the taste. I tried a little and felt the salad was pretty fresh and the sauce pretty good, but I suppose she ordered two dishes which were both sweet tasting and so it did not go down very well for her.The decor is quite homely and comfy, the tables are really close together so you have to squeeze between tables to get out of your seat if you're sitting inside. (I am a size 8 and I had trouble squeezing out!). The plates are simple and I do not mind one bit since this is more like a cafe than a high dining restaurant.The bill came to \u00a320 per head. The food is pretty good here so I don't mind it, although I feel it could be slightly cheaper to cater for more people.",

Wouldn't recommend the venison, as tasty as it sounds they cook the beautiful game to death and its chewy when well done instead of succulent and moist when cooked medium-rare. Fine for a quick bite if you're in the 'hood, but don't head out of your way or bother with a reservation.",

A tempting choice for 14.5 pounds really. Maybe when my wallet doesn't hurt, I'll switch from the affordable pad thai to something more on the menu.

Gentle reader, how many prawns make a Pad Thai? Going to Busaba for a comparison this evening... watch that space......I was psyched when this place opened as a pop-up in December '09, as the Spitalfields restaurant has long been one of my favourites. Maybe Rosa's is suffering a bit from a different clientele, or has yet to settle in to its new location, but service is occasionally a little patchy - they're not too good at being busy and attentive - so it can be a bit too long to be acknowledged if you're waiting for a table. Food ranges from great (the calamari, prawns, etc) to a tad mediocre (pad thai, fish curry served in an undercooked butternut squash). Staples are good, and signature dishes are well worth a try. Of three visits, two have been great and one 'so-so'. Best seats are for two, along the wall as you go in. Avoid downstairs - there can be some pretty hideous group feeding going on down there!",

The Gaong Dang Nuea (grilled Venison curry) was a nice red curry but needs to be a bit more strong in flavour (suspect that the traditional version has been tempered for European palates).

    "text": "Good Thai food in a great location. This is my second time here at Rosa's. The food I ordered both times were yummy and tasted authentic. This time I had Prawn Tom Yum Soup, Thick Red Chicken Curry, Roasted Duck Curry, a Coconut Rice, and to finish.. Mango Sticky Rice Pudding. The curries tasted so good, especially the thick red chicken curry (penang). I wasn't disappointed with any of the main dishes. I had Thai Iced Milk Tea to drink, which it my favourite!The reason for me coming to this restaurant a second time was for the Mango & Sticky Rice Pudding. I didn't realise this was on the menu the first time I visited so I have been eager to go back. When I was seated I noticed the Mango & Sticky Rice was crossed off on the desserts board so I immediately asked the waitress if they still had them, they confirmed they did and reserved 2 Mango & Sticky Rice dishes for my table (I wouldn't be here if I couldn't eat it!!!).But... It wasn't good. The sticky rice was perfect, it was as I remember it when I was in Thailand, but the mango.. I wasn't even sure it was a mango... lol. It was orange and very, very sweet. Nothing like the mango I received on the trips to Thailand, so low and behold I have deducted a star (otherwise my score would be 5/5!). When I want Thai food again I will come back to Rosa's because their main dishes are very tasty and authentic, the service is good and the atmosphere is nice too. You should go try them!",

    "text": "Wasn't too sure about Rosa's Thai Cafe and it always seemed to me to be a tourist type place because of its location in heart of Soho but I realised they had other branches. One being in Shoreditch which I passed frequently.My friend reccomended I go and I heard quite good things. Of course me being me I always go for the special. Today was the 'Gaeng Ped' - Roasted Duck Curry \u00a0from the seasonal menu.Duck breast, with a rich sauce combined with the sweetness coming from pineapple, grapes and cherry tomatoes. It all worked well and gave me a sense of what I had built up to know about a mixture of combinations that Thai cooking has.The only thing is that I had to order rice separately which when you order a main dish just over \u00a310 is a bit frustrating to me. My friend had a noodle dish that she thought was ok. I think I enjoyed my duck curry better. Anything with duck at an Asian eaterie is always music to my ears so I did enjoy it.Must add it's a small place. Upstairs tables were huddled and no more than 4 max I reckon. I waited 10 mins and we were seated downstairs which had a little more space. By he kitchen in the corner. I suppose a 'cafe' should be small and cosy anyway, though it was a strange ambiance downstairs as opposed to upstairs which had more vibrancy (though you can hear each other more downstairs!). Defo one to check out in the tourist part of town.",

The service wasn't as good, I'd ordered the same pad thai with prawns as Spitalfields just to see how they compare, but received no prawns, was given chicken instead. Didn't really mind too much however this padthai was not very good. Lacked flavour and the noodles were over cooked. Pad thai's not hard to make so...hmm. Overall a pretty disappointing experience really. Someone did order the pineapple fried rice which was served in a pineapple.. Bit of a novelty, can't say if it was any good though. Won't be coming back again, but can recommend the Spitalfield's branch.",

The sauce was quite flavourful, and the portion was just appropriate as well. We also ordered the Thai calamari and spring rolls to share. Everything was solid, and the calamari was especially fresh. Ambience was quite intimate and felt authentic. Not your spacious, westernised Thai restaurant but rather, smaller and lower key Thai kitchen. Service was kind and prompt. I felt like the staff was very accessible, though they weren't the fastest in filling up our water glasses. Would definitely go back for some of the other dishes!",

We had to ask for more drinks and werent offered.What really made me chuckle was my friend asked to have his jacket hung up and she just pointed accross the restaurant to a hook and he had to get up and go and do it himself!The food was lovely and for that reason i would go back again.

Soho gave me the completely opposite experience, with more hole-in-the-wall food options than I have time to handle! Rosa's Thai is just that, a homey yet hipster spot serving up traditional Thai food. We started with the tom yum soup, which had some of the best flavors that I've had in tom yum ever. The lime flavor was really strong, which made every bite of vegetables and chicken extremely vibrant. The pad thai was also made very well, not adding any strange ketchup flavors to cater to foreign tastes. The stir fries were a little on the greasy side, but overall the meats and vegetables were seasoned and cooked well. Being used to American-sized portions, it was a little difficult to pay double the price for half the portion, but it really is more satisfying for the palate to eat just enough and enjoy a homey meal!",

We were very hungry and immediately seated. Staff was very friendly and attentive. Overall, the service was excellent! Many groups came soon after and filled up the small restaurant.We ordered Chicken Pad Thai, Fresh Spring Rolls with peanut sauce, Sirloin Beef, Brown Rice, Thai Iced Tea, Green Tea and Mango Sticky Rice. Everything was delicious \"especially the steak sauce.\" I think I had to pay extra for the peanut sauce and also pay separately for the brown rice. I'm from California and rice and peanut sauce are usually included. It was quite expensive but I'm not from London, U.K. so maybe it was normal price. About 50 pounds total for everything. We were pretty full by the end and didn't even get to finish the Mango Stick Rice.. It was my first time trying it and I really liked it.

I understand if you have forgotten. I'm sure you have many people dining with you. I had a Tom Yam soup that was very nice and for my main dish I ordered chicken Larb, though it was called something entirely different at your restaurant. This is probably for the best, as Larb is a very gross sounding name.Overall, I was glad I came to see you, Rosa. I visited with about 10 of my closest friends and we all had a pleasant experience. That said, I do not think I will be visiting you again in the near future, as there are many Thai restaurants in the neighboring area and I would like to spend time with them as well.Say hi to your mom for me.Love,Mike",
