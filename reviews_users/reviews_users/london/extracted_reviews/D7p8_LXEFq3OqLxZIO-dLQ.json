    "text": "Tucked away from the chaos of Covent Garden we stepped into the hedge maze from the Shining for what would end up being an odd experience. I have never seen a bigger drop off from back of house to front, but that is just what we got. Even though we booked at least one month out, we were seated at the first table in the bar. We asked about being seated elsewhere, and were told that we had not requested the dining room and this would be our table. Next time I guess I'll inform them of my desire to eat when placing my dinner reservation. This set the tone for the pretentious service we would have all night. The large table next to us was halfway through the meal and the staff still managed to spill three times on them. I think the only \"apology\" one poor guy who had coffee spilled all over his suit received was a napkin. Staff was not too helpful with selections and every interaction was curt, if even a word said. We heard tables ask about the need for side dishes. \u00a0The staff did not really respond, instead they just placed an order for more food. The entrees are huge and the sides largely untouched. Thankfully, that moves us on to the food which was fantastic. We started with grilled scallops served on mashed potatoes. Entrees were a dry aged Scottish ribeye, gratin potatoes and haricot verts. It was served a bit undercooked when the knife finally arrived for me. It was a large cut and a sizable portion compared to many taster sizes at similar restaurants. We finished with a very tasty lemon meringue before waiting a long time on our bill. A fitting conclusion to two ends of the spectrum between very high quality food and terrible service.",

I believe what he meant to ask us was if we would like an aperitif however, we asked to look at the menu first, and were given a lot of time to do so. Our Server was wonderful though. We ordered the seasonal tasting menu, my husband had the wine paring and I opted for a cocktail. The food was spectacular! The foie gras was to die for!!! Overall, an excellent dining experience.",

Packed to the rafters prior to theatre, once the luvvies have disappeared, the place really comes into it's own. The lighting is subtle, the conservatory - if you can get a table there - is delightful and the service matches the sublime elegance of the food to a tee. The wine list can appear as a bit of a shocker but, put your pretensions in your back pocket and even the cheapest wines on the extensive menu are wonderful. Pretty much all the dishes appear to be a smidge heavy on the truffles which, whilst delightful, can leave you feeling that you won't be needing a kebab on the way home. The pace is unhurried and friendly, and the waiters more than willing to make sensible suggestions for both food and wine. A really lovely and relaxing way to wind down after a day in town.",

The low lighting, wood, reds and greens make for a beautiful decor and the menus are indulgent enough for any special occasion. It's quite hard to book a table but we ended up walking in spontaneously on a Wednesday night around 8pm and had no issue sitting straight down. We took the seasonal tasting menu which is reasonably priced at \u00a355/pers (without wine). The five course meal was delicious, portions are not very big but by the time we'd finished we certainly weren't hungry. The food is rich, flavours very well brought together and produce of great quality. There's no particular risk taken on the food associations - foie gras/duck and fruit, fish and chorizo... But sometimes traditional is just right, especially when you are out for a classy date. If you're not a pudding person please don't skip this one - it was the culinary highlight of the meal. Loved it, looking forward to going back. Would probably try a la carte next time or go back when new season kicks in on the tasting page. Or maybe even try the veggie tasting menu...",

    "text": "This is possibly one of my favourite restaurants in London. Nestled only a short walk away from bustling Covent Garden is this extremely cute little place.What is most striking is its interior. It is in a Georgian townhouse, and as soon as you enter you just feel like you're in a different world. Their website describes it as a 'romantic remembrance of stylish country inns in Provence and Tuscany', and they couldn't be more right. I have always dined in the conservatory of the downstairs dining area, with only around 7 tables, the space is very small, however you don't feel cramped at all. The ceiling is high, topped with a glass roof, allowing lots of natural light, and accentuated with the soft yellow glow of side lamps dotted around the room. Cherry blossom flowers are weaved around the walls, and at the end of the room is a fire place, it is simply the epitome of cosy and intimate. Unlike many high-end restaurants, the food comes in decent portions, and is well presented in a very creative manner. The menu is warm and filling from just reading through it, with a fusion of French flavours, and the ingredients are always fresh and \u00a0according to season. The dishes are hearty and sumptuous with such things as 'roasted fillet of 'Duke of Westminster' venison with prune and turnip gratin and bitter chocolate sauce', or 'treacle caramelised breast of Gressingham duck with poached figs, ruby port sauce.' The desserts are always perplexing to me as I can never seem to envision what exactly will be served from just looking at how it is described on the menu, but nevertheless, I am always impressed. They have a 3 course lunch menu for just under 20 pounds, an extensive, award winning wine list, and the staff are friendly and extremely attentive, but they don't linger. All in all, a very impressive place worth every penny for a visit!",

I will now add \"beef cheek\" to dishes I want to try at home!Monkfish - I've never been a huge fan of fish, but this was seasoned and cooked to perfection. \u00a0The outside was nice and \u00a0crispy and soft on the inside. \u00a0It came with prawns as well. \u00a0Both mains were delicious. \u00a0I had the 3 course and got the coffee and petite fours for dessert. \u00a0They were 6 scrumptious little samples of YUM! \u00a0I said that anything that is gold dusted will most certainly be delicious and I was right! \u00a0I love deals, I love good food, I love good service, I love ambiance. \u00a0All of which I got at Clos Maggiore for lunch! \u00a0Party!",

    "text": "Lauded as one of London's most romantic restaurants and just a short stroll from Covent Garden's Piazza, Clos Maggiore is a winner of a setting for a date. The accolades have as much to do with the restaurant's dreamily cherry blossom-filled conservatory as with the menu \u00a0which is gorgeous. As far as I can tell anyway: I've only been once and that was to sample their ultimate chocolate menu coinciding with Chocolate Week back in October (2010). The six course tasting menu was as intriguing as it is luxuriant - more a gourmet dining experience than merely a nice meal - and, when paired with their specially selected wines, yielded a delicious flight of flavour for contemplative foodies with sophisticated palates and a sheer delight for any palate otherwise. Service is exceptional, the location is convenient and the wine list rocks! I'm keen to return for a go at Clos Maggiore's regular menu. In fact, I've already made the rez.",

After taking into account all the advice from Yelp and various other sites, I selected this Covent Garden French eatery. Supposedly the BEST French restaurant in all of London, I was told. Perhaps even the best restaurant of any cuisine in London.Puh-lease. This place isn't even the best restaurant on this STREET. I had booked weeks in advance and we got put in the cave of the upstairs private room. Those wanting to dine in the lovely conservatory be warned - specify on your reservation.To their credit, my tomato salad was delicate and ripe. My dining companion's scallops were perfectly cooked. Our entrees, on the other hand, were mediocre at best. Nearly \"inedible\" tagiatelle and beef that was anything but gourmet. The service was slow but our waitress was good natured, if not taken aback by the fact that we didn't come close to finishing our dishes.We booked it out of there and luckily caught a window at our favorite restaurant for dessert.

Each course was beautifully plated and tasted even better!I started with braised shoulder of Loire Valley rabbit - so good! The main course was fabulous; treacle caramelised Gressingham duck breast with roasted red plums, saut\u00e9ed bok choy, and ruby port sauce. The excellent meal ended with an amazing desert; Amalfi lemon & olive oil tiramisu (fresh Amalfi lemon & thyme sorbet).

Once we were done with our mains, all we wanted to do was pay our check and get out into the cool air outside. \u00a0Unfortunately, we wound up sitting with our plates in front of us for an additional 20 minutes before they were cleared and a dessert menu shoved in front of us wordlessly, with the server abruptly departing before we could say \"check please!\" \u00a0Another 20 minutes before a new waiter came over to ask if we'd like dessert, to which we finally replied \"no thank you, check please\". He then awkwardly asked if we were celebrating anything, and I quietly replied that we were on our honeymoon. \u00a0That was apparently a mistake, as he disappeared again only to emerge 15 minutes later with a giant \"congratulations\" plate arranged with a few small petit fours, a sweet gesture (though worth noting every table received the same treats at the end of their meals), but it took another 20 minutes after that before we were able to successfully wave down the manager for our check.We encountered a few other services issues (including the manager arguing with kitchen staff), but I feel like I've already ventured too far into petty-town, you get the picture. tl;dr : \u00a0food = very good, wait staff needs management overhaul and proper training",

    "text": "After a lukewarm review in the last fortnight by Grace Dent, I was reconsidering the wisdom of my choice to bring my wife here for our 4th anniversary.I'm glad I stayed the course.In terms of location - we did end up in one of those slightly sub-optimal places outside of the main atrium, but you know what? I didn't mind. Even the relatively pokey table we got (booking only 2 weeks in advance is apparently a rookie error) was actually fine. Would it've been nicer to be in the conservatory? By the looks of it yes, but the ambience was perfectly adequate. Granted, the whole \"most romantic restaurant in London\" vibe was missing, but it was still completely fit for purpose for a nice evening meal with a loved one.Service throughout was absolutely spot on; from the girl who greeted us and took our coats, through to the sommelier and the food runners, all of the staff were attentive, jovial, and professional. As a restaurateur, my biggest pet peeve is bad service, but these guys didn't put a foot wrong. Nothing was too much trouble, and they balanced well the needs for discretion and engaging service. Breads looked superb in totality, though I never moved beyond their frankly sublime cheese focaccia. My opening piece which seemed to boast a schmear of ricotta in the centre was indisputably one of the finest breads I've had. 2 Further pieces lacked the same slightly sharp bite of cheese filling, but remained gloriously soft and flavourful.Food was consistently good. Crab with smoked anchovy and cauliflower brought together 2 of my least favourite things into a very surprising dish. Paired with a wonderful Alsatian Riesling, it promised that the rest might well blow my concerns out of the water.Foie Gras next, with roasted quince and gingerbread. Wonderful. A light touch from the kitchen, evocative of something I couldn't quite put my finger on, but it conjured up very warm feelings. Great little confit duck croquette. Served alongside a stunning Fiano orange wine, this was a great next step.Cod with vermicelli and chorizo was one of the less exciting dishes. Beautifully cooked fish, with a lightly spiced pasta (they described it as more like a paella, which sort of makes sense in terms of the serve) was very pleasant, if not as demanding of oohing and aahing as other courses. Gorgeous duck with roasted plum and endive to follow. Slightly overcooked against the medium-rare that they recommended, but on the rarer side of medium, so hardly a travesty. My virtual thermometer may be off, but I know the Chef that night was French, so am surprised he erred towards better done. A stunning 2001 'Corullon' from Spain quickly smoothed over any slight wrinkles.A last minute request for the cheese course was graciously obliged, and I'm incredibly pleased that it was so. A wonderful cross section, including Lancashire Bomb and Bleu St Jacques was superb, along with a cheeky Madeira. Biscuits are supposedly \"hand baked\", though they looked bought in. Very nice all the same.We closed on a peanut butter parfait with a black sesame sponge which was a very interesting juxtaposition of flavours and textures. Not seen anyone convert black sesame into the almost seaweed-like sponge that accompanied this. The accompanying 2007 Jurancon was bang on the money - by far one of the better ones I've tried.Petits Fours, coffee and Calvados, along with some complimentary eaux de vies, provided a very welcome rounding off.All in all a very worthy location for a dinner, regardless of which table you get. I will certainly be popping back in (maybe even just for an impromptu course or two with a glass of wine, but can happily recommend it for any and all occasions. Fellow diners appeared to comprise birthdays, large groups, and informal post-dinner crowds, so the clientele is an interesting mix, though it seems like a degree of pre-planning is required to have any certainty of a table.",

No one balked at our attire. Instead, the politely took our coats and seated us in a cozy room with a fireplace that was much welcomed by us after a day in the rain.We both ordered the tasting menu and I had the paired wines. Before each course was presented, the wine steward presented the bottle at the table and explained a bit about the wine as well as their reasons for choosing it to compliment the dish.The scallops were perfectly cooked-- deliciously seared on the outside. Foie gras with pear and this crispy little semi sweet cookie was out of this world and paired with a Gewurtztraminer from Washington. Lamb chops were succulent and they brought an amazing cheese course with four fabulous cheeses, crackers and quince jam. Dessert was a molten chocolate cake... so gooey and delicious, served with a Sauterne!? It was heavenly!Service was a little stiff but wonderfully efficient and informative.The tasting menu was great value, I won't confess to know what the bill was since my boyfriend paid-- I know it wasn't cheap-- but the quality and presentation were outstanding. Coupled with the fabulously cozy and romantic decor, it made for a wonderful evening.I would recommend this restaurant to couples--possibly small family gatherings. It's definitely an intimate environment. I think a large group would be better off to book a private room here.We would happily return to Clos Maggiore the next time we are in London.",

A much better spaced out and ambiance setting for romantic meals would be Greenhouse in Mayfair.. but completely different price point.As for the food, I found the A La Carte a better option than the given tasting menu. The food is quite greasy and cooking skills were not put to test with the presentation similar to that of a posh school dinner..? Best way to describe it !So 3/5 given for the overall experience. My suggestion would be to have a drink and a view of the main room. And save your appetite for a better eatery.",

The dishes are plated beautifully, the service is exemplary, and the food is absolutely to die for.As an appetizer, I had the \"Fresh Maine Lobster, Scallop & King PrawnTortellini\". The scallop is sweet and tender, the lobster is succulent. For the main course, I had the chicken leg stuffed with sausage. Again, the perfect seasonings and tastes. I wasn't overly impressed with the mashed potatoes and carrots that we ordered as sides. Finally, I had pralines and toasted hazelnuts, which was a perfect end to an incredible feast. The setting is incredible with the indoor garden theme as well. Well recommended, even if you're not going as a couple - the food alone is worth it!",

    "text": "This is an old school, attentive, formal and fussy french restaurant. Initially I found it all, including the staff, a bit over bearing, and just too formal for my liking. I also thought they seemed a bit unreasonably annoyed with us as two of our party were very late. However I think they did warm up to us, or perhaps we just warmed to them.Our party was too large to sit there, however smaller groups of four of less can sit in the light and very pretty 'garden' area underneath pink (and surely artificial) blossoms.The a la carte is not available on weekends. There's a three course set menu only, which actually makes financial sense given that it includes half a bottle of wine. \u00a0On the set there were only a limited number of dishes I could order due to my fussy diet - there were many dishes that seems ok on the surface and then on closer inspection were stuffed with shellfish and pork (things I do not eat). I ordered a very delicious gazpacho soup, followed by an intense and tasty duck and a very interesting nougat glace for dessert.I came out of lunch clutching my stomach for over consumption of so much rich food over three courses (not including the really yummy foccacia at the start!). Overall it was good and I did enjoy it, but the restaurant was just a bit too traditional in attitude for my liking. It was also a bit of a shock to find out they actually charged on the bill for the seemingly complementary petit fours served at the end. We were so full at the time, we could have very easily skipped them. Very cheeky and underhand Clos Maggiore, very cheeky of you indeed.",

    "text": "I wanted to treat my family to a nice meal on our vacation in London while still trying to maintain a budget since the exchange rate is horrible against the dollar.I read in a few traveler guides that the \u00a319.50 3 course pre fixe was a good value at Clos Maggiore. I suppose considering the cost of most meals in London we did get a decent value but was expecting more from this restaurant.The conservatory room is gorgeous and intimate. Since it was a clear day they opened the retractable glass roof which brought in a nice fresh breeze. Only issue with that was little black seeds, that looked like rat droppings, kept falling from above onto diners.Our head waiter was a strange. He had to go over our orders multiple times and had to look over the menu more than once after I gave my order. I think a restaurant of this quality should have waitstaff that are familiar with the menu. At one point he chased me down on my way to the bathroom to clarify one more time what my starter was even though 3 of us ordered the same thing!The food was just average and the options were rather limiting. I ordered the pork terrine and thought it was good but my sister likened it to fancy spam. My hubby ordered the crab mousseline for his starter which had an supplemental fee of \u00a35 and not worth it. Bisque was more like a foam and the portions of scallops were small.For entrees, I had the guinea fowl and everyone else ordered the red mullet w/smoked haddock risotto. I found the smoked fish flavour very overpowering. The mushrooms on my dish were tasty albeit on the salty side. I've never had guinea fowl but it tasted like old chicken and not very tender.my mom's favorite part of the meal was the plum tart dessert. I don't think my family was too impressed with the meal.",

When I made my reservation the only slot they had was for 10:30 PM. Normally this would be ok w/ me however we had our son w/ us during the trip & being jet lag it would be horrible to try to stay awake to enjoy your meal. So a couple days before we departed for London, I phoned them to confirm our reservation. I was a bit hesitant to ask but I did anyways, and asked if they had any opening at all for an early seating and just my luck one opened up for the conservatory area by the fireplace! The whole experience was just amazing! The food, the wine, the complimentary dessert was delicious! All the staff from our waiter, to the host (who helped me get the earlier booking) were just impressive! The place was just beautiful & very romantic! I heard they do a Christmas theme decor in their conservatory, which would be nice to see. On the repeat list for sure.",

Named, \"The most romantic restaurant in the world.\" And by all means this post is not meant in any way to boast but rather to suggest to you if you or know of someone that is a huge foodie or and looking for a beautiful experience in dining while in London please share this place on. My husband and I love trying different cuisines and wines when we can. So I truly would love to take a moment to share with you of this beautiful gem off Covent Garden in London. From the moment we walked in, the amazing food, impressive 2,500+ in international wine selection, and impeccable service are just few to describe of the wonderful experience we had when we were there. There is a 6-7 month wait list for reservations but is well worth it, so book ahead. A romantic and small French cafe from the outside leads you in to a warm greeting as they'll help you to your area of seating request. From that moment we were lost in words entering the most beautiful conservatory elegantly adorned with cherry blossoms above. We then met our waiter Hugo.Attentive, wonderful and just made sure we really enjoyed ourselves. He helped answered all of our questions, made sure if we had any food allergies, and thoroughly explained what each dish was and how it was prepared. We then tried the seasonal tasting menu which consisted of 5 dishes starting with: Handpicked dorset crab mayonnaise with green apple & mango salsa, followed by the most delicious Pan-roasted Les Landes Duck Foie Gras with Fig and Oat biscuit, Pan-roasted and smoked wild sea bass with smoked haddock and leek croquette, oven-roasted and herb smoked \u00cdberiko pork loin with chorizo and sweet peppers. Every dish was decadent, flavorful and truly unique on its own but complimented the dish right before it perfectly. At this point-of-time I thought I had reached my limit on tummy capacity. I mean, how could I even possibly take another bite? But it's dessert! there's always room for dessert!We finished it off with Blackcurrant sorbet paired with champagne foam. Mind blown. Please be sure to give them a visit when you're in town, you truly won't regret it.",

I was hoping to sit in the Conservatory, but when I asked about it when we came in they said they were booked until December! That's 3 months!So we were seated upstairs in an intimate room & had the seasonal tasting menu with wine pairing. I choose the vegetarian tasting menu & who knew vegetables could taste so good!! It really showed that the simplest dishes could still taste amazing & didn't need to sacrifice flavor! FOOD & DRINK HIGHLIGHTS-Chargrilled Green Asparagus: Really asparagus? This was the best asparagus I've ever had. \u00a0I didn't expect too much from it by just looking at it, but it was SO DELICIOUS! My husband doesn't like asparagus & he thought it was amazing too. -Papardella with Truffle & Mushrooms: This dish was so decadent. Instead of adding freshly grated parmesan on top, they put freshly grated truffle on top! What?! & they add a good layer on top.-Iced Green Apple Parfait: Wow. This was the perfect fall dessert. -Shetland Isles Mussel & Saffron Soup: I was obsessed with the mussels in London & I love saffron so I thought this was going to be really good & it was! Everything we had was amazing & the wine pairing was PERFECT! I discovered a new favorite wine of mine, Foradori Fontanasanta Nosiola. CONSERVATORY vs SITTING UPSTAIRSFirst time when we were seated upstairs, it felt more intimate & service was very attentive. The team worked well with one another & everything flowed. There was never a time our water wasn't filled & they were ready for our next course when we were. It gave us a better chance to enjoy the food & the entire experience. The 2nd time we asked a couple days early if we could make a reservation & a reservation was just cancelled. We were so lucky that we got the middle table in the Conservatory! In the Conservatory, the team seemed a little more flustered possibly because the Conservatory & downstairs area is larger. The Conservatory was really beautiful & romantic!! Both experiences/rooms felt different, but we enjoyed Clos Maggiore very much. If only this place wasn't thousands of miles away from home!",

    "text": "I came here for the beautiful dining room, left was thoroughly impressed by the whole dining experience. The conservatory here is known as one of the most beautiful and romantic dining rooms in London, with delicate flowers and lights strewn in a canopy below a skylight, a nice fireplace, and a number of very well placed mirrors to make the place look much bigger than it is. I was surprised to find that there are only 7 tables in the room, which explains why you have to book 6 months in advance! Most tables were occupied by parties of 2 (lots of couples), but two in the corners were larger and seated groups of 3 or 4. There is an awkward table in the middle that ends up being watched by the groups of two, so try to avoid that one if you can! We saw a couple sit there and then were re-seated just a few minutes later (presumably they asked to be moved). We ordered from the rather affordable seasonal set menu (5 courses for \u00a365) and opted for the wine pairing, which is \u00a340 per person. The food was excellent and the wine pairing phenomenal, with unique wines like whites from Santa Barbara and a red dessert wine. They even accepted my substitution request without question when I wanted a dish from the vegetarian set menu instead of one of ones from the main set menu. Service was very quick and we didn't have to wait long for any dish, and the sommelier always just behind, ready with an explanation of why the wine was chosen for the pairing. In all, we finished 5 courses in less than 2 hours (that's my kind of fine dining!) I would recommend this for couples or special occasions, it's just such an incredible place and one of those quintessential London classics. But book ahead for the conservatory! Definitely worth the wait!",

    "text": "I went last night for a meal I had pre-booked since last year. I chose this because of all of its famed reviews, reputation & such. Clos Maggiore lived upto the hype. Oh so very very well.I had got the Conservatory room, the one its most famous for. However I wouldn't have minded either way. The other parts of the restaurant seep charm and grace. The food and service is second to none and never have I felt so special and cared for. I saw other reviewers saying they never got the conservatory and frankly, was it because I booked ahead? was it because we ate at 7pm when it was quieter, or was I lucky? Not sure. We were a couple and it was almost as if that room never had a table bigger than 2-4 anyway. Mostly it sat couples.The food is to die for, im getting hungry again just thinking about it. I was tempted for the taster menu but we felt we would both have a starter, a main and a shared desert with coffee & Petit fours. Certainly it was pricey but it was a special anniversary meal that was worth paying for. Thoroughly recommend the place and want to go back asap!",

Made up to look like a French courtyard it has twinkling fairy lights and faux apple blossom. So pretty - somehow they managed to avoid tackiness. Summer is the best when the skylight is open.Anyway, the food. It is really good - I'll admit not the best French/Mediterranean in London but let's face it, you're mainly here for the ambience. I highly recommend the pasta - I rarely eat pasta out but Clos Maggiore's really is superb. As is the confit duck. Service is fantastic. Friendly and attentive but not intrusive.Oh and if you're a wine lover - they have a ONE HUNDRED PAGE wine list with over 2,500 wines!",

    "text": "We booked a lunch reservation here 3 months before heading to London for our honeymoon, as there were no dinner reservations available. We were so excited about dining here. It was to be a highlight of our stay. We received a call and voicemail from the restaurant a week before our reservation and upon calling them back, I spoke with one of the rudest woman I have ever had the displeasure of speaking with. When I tried to get clarification on our reservation (I didn't realize there were two sections of the restaurant and was advised this via their voicemail) the woman on the other line was clearly annoyed that she had to explain this to me. After she explained there were two sections and we wouldn't be eating in the conservatory (the beautiful section you see in all their photos) she proceeded to tell me that in order to be seated in the conservatory, we would have needed to book our LUNCH reservation a YEAR IN ADVANCE. I have to put this is caps because it blows my mind that they wouldn't have this listed anywhere on their site. A kind \"FYI, most people who are seated in our conservatory book a year in advance\" or something of this nature would have been nice. Still, this wasn't an absolute no-go for us. What sealed the deal was the next thing she said... \"So, are you going to confirm your reservation or not?\" We were given no time to process what she had just said before that! Needless to say, we prefer not to have our food with a side of nasty attitude. Not only did she phrase everything as if to make it clear she thought the conversation wasn't worth her words, as soon as I said we wouldn't be confirming, she immediately hung up the phone. No \"Goodbye\", no \"Sorry to hear\", etc. We wouldn't have gone after that conversation had they paid for the meal and put us in the conservatory. \u00a0I can't believe people are still patronizing this place with a woman like her being the first impression everyone gets of their restaurant.",

(since the name of this restaurant is half French half Italian, I'd have to express my feelings for it the same way).It apparently has the reputation of being one of the most romantic restaurants in London, and indeed it is! If you are lucky enough to get seated in the conservatory area, you'd find yourself in a midsummer night's dream kind of surrounding. I went with a group of 5 and we were seated outside of the conservatory, but that's okay, we are just a bunch of foodies looking for our next favourite dinner spot. It was still a very classy setup: leather couch, white table cloths, sparkling silverware and very polite (and funny) waiters. We ordered the tasting menu. The foie gras appetizer was amazing, and I loved the asian flavoured glazed duck . The peanut butter parfait was interesting, for me it was delicious, but I can see how some people wouldn't like it if they don't like peanut butter. Our waiters and sommelier were all super helpful, and fun to chat with. In general I enjoyed dining here very much and would definitely return here. Hopefully I can book a table within the indoor garden next time!",

We were welcomed into a beautiful restaurant with impeccably dressed staff, and seated just outside the conservatory; a beautiful intimate light studded garden scene. This is my only negative, and I'd asked and been promised to be seated in this area- so I seated faced away so she could look at it in bliss and I could stare at the well stocked bar.Food was great- we ate the Pumpkin & Pine nut soup and the Braised Shoulder of Loire Valley Rabbit, Sweet & Sour Black Radish & Wholegrain Mustard Mousseline for starters. Delicious, really truly delicious. Even the bread basket was utterly morish, especially the rosemary focaccia. We asked for more, happily given.Mains were the Oven Roasted Venison Fillet, season autumnal vegetables, truffle & potato mash, with a slow cooked beef & potato gratin side; and Slow Cooked Fillet of Scottish Cod 'Rougaille' Roasted Vermicelli, Mussel & Iberico Chorizo Fideu\u00e0. Venison was perfectly cooked, as was the cod. Felt the cod dish didn't hugely work together, but might be my personal feeling- didn't leave me with a 'wow' feeling unlike the rest of the food. Wine- The sommelier was extremely helpful and paired us two different wine wines for starters, and another white (for her) and deep red for my venison. I've completely lost my notes on what they were, but will update when I read their extensive wine list.We were so full we skipped on dessert barring a decent but not special coffee. Which was fine as they brought out a plate with 'Happy Anniversary' written in chocolate and some cake. Nice touch and I had forgotten I'd told them!Leaving I had a great talk with the front of house about their wine cellar whom nearly brought me down for a look but construction was going on. Next time!Overall- 100% recommended. Expensive yes, coming in around \u00a3120, but once utterly worth it. Get into the conservatory however! It's magical.",

And when I booked my table I hoped and prayed to be seated in the middle of all the floral glory, with the warm lighting reflected on the mirrors surrounding the room. To my pleasant surprise, I managed to be seated with my partner, on my birthday in this beautiful room I had imagine for so long. It is the most beautiful restaurant I have been to till date, without a doubt. However, I do feel that with all the reviews and pictures I had previously seen, I was not taken aback by the fact that I was in the room...... quite simply, the excitement of the restaurant is so highly televised that I was not taken with surprise the way I had imagined. Yes I was in this beautifully decorated romantic restaurantYes, it was in my birthdayYes, with my partner And yet I expected more. The restaurant itself is very small and you feel very intimate not only with your partner but with everyone else in the room. The mirrors make it appear deceptively bigger than it is. One thing I cannot fault, is the service. Neither my partner or myself are the most flamboyant or immaculately dressed, however, we received a very warm service. If you are not used to fine dining, you may occasionally within this small boogie setting, feel out of place. However, if you're like me you know you came with enough \u00a3\u00a3 to cover your meal... simply eat and enjoy.",

The service was good, but not compared to the US. The decor is very masculine. If you're really big on service then you may get slightly annoyed. They did some odd things. For example, if we were finished with a dish, one person would move it to the edge of the table instead of taking it.... our salad came after we had already been eating our entree... I don't mean to be knit picky but when you expect fine dining, you should expect fine service, and I was disappointed. We were given some butter with sea salt and small pot of biscuits, in addition to the bread service. We bought a bottle of the Foxglove Zinfandel and started with the Marcellin's Heritage Shoulder of Loire Valley Rabbit. To be honest, I thought it was just very slightly over cooked. About half of my portion was dry, but for the rest, I felt all the elements were really deliciously and elegantly put together. For our entree we both had the Oven Roasted Welsh Rack of Lamb and Chargrilled Belly. They first brought out the lamb to show us before it was plated. I found this step to be very Interesting and it allowed us to really smell the lamb and prepare our taste buds for the dish. This was absolutely delicious! And the best lamb I've ever had. I highly recommend this! It didn't have a strong lamb flavor so if you generally don't like super gamey meats, this is still really tasty! For dessert we had the whites chocolate mousse and fresh gariguette 'volupt\u00e9' we almost licked the plate clean. We were given a complimentary plate of small bite desserts as well. I will definitely be coming back for the food.",

    "text": "Clos Maggiore is a romantic oasis in the heart of Covent Garden. Their warm and intimate influence comes from the country inns of Provence and Tuscany. Clos Maggiore is ranked one of the worlds most romantic restaurants. It feels magical even on the outside of the restaurant. It was the most magical anniversary celebrated since our wedding day :) As one enters Close Maggiore, you are immediately greeted by the hostess to check in and have your coats received. The hostess will then bring you into the waiting room with a beverage of your choice. The waiting room is dimly lit for a sexy and foxy ambiance. \u00a0Hubby made a late reservation at 9:30pm. Feedback states you are most likely to get a seat in the observatory with a later reservation than with an early reservation. This feedback was true as we had did get a table in the observatory. A nice cozy corner table to snuggle together under the stars on a romantic and magical December night :) The whole restaurant is beautiful and breathtaking, but the observatory is unforgettable. The conservatory is a fully retractable glass roof that is normally adorned with cherry blossoms. When we visited it was adored with rustic wood branches intertwined with greenery, Christmas lights, and Christmas ornaments. The lighting was romantic with a fusion of the starlight sky above, crackling warm fireplace in the back, Christmas lights everywhere, and a delicate candle lit on our table. Chef Marcellin Marc's love of Provencal can be experienced not only in the decor, but also in the cuisine. The dishes created from sourced local and seasonal products throughout the year to create their awarded AA-rosette award menus. One can read more details about the sourcing of ingredients on their website. It is quiet fascinating. Hubby and I both ordered items from the seasonal tasting menu. The quality of the ingredients are exceptional. One can taste the quality in every bite. Clos Maggiore believes that wine is a fundamental part of dining. Therefore they a dedicated team of Sommeliers that visit vineyards and taste hundreds of wines a year. This teamwork has produced a globally renowned wine cellar that boasts an extensive 2500 options from 18 different countries and four centuries. The restaurant has won multiple awards for their wines including one of the highest and most prestigious accolades - 'The Wine Spectator Grand Award' - one of only 70 restaurants worldwide to have achieved this honour. Lastly, they now incorporate \"Coravin\" wine preservation system so you can order by the glass. Such a fabulous restaurant is not fabulous without its staff. The service deserves a round of applause. Outstanding from the minute of arrival to departure. Intimate service never left me sit waiting for the next course, or with crumbs on the table. Truly wonderful. My favorite was the surprise was at the end. The staff provided a special \"Happy Anniversary\" dish. This topped off an already beyond perfect night. Thank you! Words cannot express enough how thankful I am to the staff. London has so much to see and offer. I would highly recommend making time to visit this restaurant. It is on par with several one Michelin star restaurants in London. In addition, it's not just a restaurant, but an experience you will remember for many years. Thank you Clos Maggiore!",

    "text": "It's taken me a while to muster up the courage to write this review. Mostly just because I made a reservation 6 months in advance because that's how long the wait time is, so naturally, I was expecting to be blown away. But shoot, how can you not put so much pressure on the place and have your expectations high as heck when you wait 6 months to eat there!? Basically, what happened was I wasn't blown away, and I was sad because I wanted to be. But whatever, I'm going to write about it mostly just for myself because I'm strange and enjoy re-reading my reviews and remembering the experience. Also people may be interested in my point of view, but I really don't want anyone to be put off from going here because of me. The conservatory room is the one room that has the ungodly wait for it. If you want a weekend dinner slot, it'll probably be more like 8 months + for a spot. They have plenty of other tables in other rooms that you don't have to wait that long for, but I was all about the special room because it's awesome to surprise yourself on a \u00a0random weeknight in January and the prices seemed semi-reasonable for a wait time like that. So anyway LETS GET TO IT! We were welcomed and they took our coats and seated us. They put us at a table situation in the middle of the room. It's a relatively small square room and there are tables placed in the corners and side of the room, and then there's a round one smack in the middle. We were at that table and it felt sort of in the centre of everything, not terribly intimate, and we had to sit across from one another so he felt sort of far away from me. It also gave the waiters 4 different angles to approach us, which meant we were checked on a lot. All of these things seem very minimal, but I guess they began to add up over time. We thought it would be a super calm, chill, and relaxing evening, but because there were so many people to take care of us it was not relaxing. Probably 3 different waiters tried to take our order before we were ready. It's not really their fault, that's just what happens when you don't have a set waiter for a set table I guess. I also asked to hold on to the menu, and a second later, another waiter took it up, because that's what happens when you have so many people attending to you! It was also quite funny, because there was so much confusion around the tasting menu. We wanted to know if it was possible to order a vegetarian tasting menu and also a fish only one, and they got quite confused. One waiter had to get another to come over and then another came over which made me quite embarrassed thinking that this question wasn't that big of a deal. It also felt like everyone was looking at us because we were literally in the centre of the room. In the end they told us we could only pick 2 options of the 5 and it was to the point where we just though, \"ok, I guess we should just stop asking questions\". I still don't get how the tasting menu works. The food was good. We had the Spanish octopus salad and crab and salmon roulade for starters. The octopus salad had plenty of sausage in it which I was not expecting. Ok ok, it does say \"Pig's Trotter Croquet and young leaves\" in smaller print underneath. Derp. The salmon roulade and crab was very tasty. For mains we had turbot and the truffle pasta with a side of truffle mashed potatoes and mushrooms. To be honest those sides were totally out of this world and I would have been happy just eating those with the complimentary cheese puff things they give you. Their bread (especially the focaccia! is also delicious. I really did enjoy the truffle pasta, but wasn't a fan of the turbot. The room is very beautiful and I can imagine it being even more lovely during the daytime with all the natural light and lovely flowers. We enjoyed the experience but my biggest compliant would be we were \"too taken care of\". Which is a thing. I felt rushed and we were checked on too often. Of course anyone should come here to experience it for themselves. This was just my experience.",

    "text": "This is truly the most romantic restaurant i have ever seen. The articles are right. The most memorable meal I had in London - from the high level of service to the exquisite food to the jaw-dropping romantic atmosphere. If you are a couple in love, this should be at the top of your restaurant bucket list. If you are a solo or group foodie, then dine in their well appointed dining room surrounding the romantic conservatory so that you can enjoy this fine meal without the sappy lovers swapping gazes. I'll start with the food because it cannot be overstated how much attention was placed to every taste detail. Even the salad left you wondering - how do they do it? Salad shouldn't taste this good. Get the salad.I ordered the burrata with marinated beets - totally odd composition to me, but the chef pulled it off. As beautifully set as this dish was, the taste was better. Flawless. Get this one too.For my entree I ordered the line caught cod. Bonus points to CM for the line caught fish. The flavors were subtle and enjoyable.We had to get on to our show, so no time for dessert, but I could have stayed in that restaurant for hours drinking the fine wines they had available. I was impressed with the sommelier who did not suggest the highest priced glass of wine. He chose the perfect pairing for my entree.Not only was the sommelier on point, every person from the hostess to the bread boy (?), the waiter to the manager was above and beyond knowledgeable and kind. Patient with my questions about the food and request for pictures, this team could not be thanked enough. I wanted to hug everyone there.During our meal this woman showed up dressed in cargo pants and flip flops asking for a table here. The manager was nicer than I would have been but politely told her that the conservatory (where the flowers hang) books 6 months in advance and she could not be accommodated. I mean, you can see walking in that this is a very nice place - and you want to be sat looking like you just came off the fishing pier? Whaaaa? Who does that? Have some respect for yourself and the people who are all in there dressed nicely for a formal meal and t he proprietors who are trying to create a romantic ambiance. The moral of this story is make reservations far in advance and dress appropriately.I am not a poet, as any words I could compose would fail to do justice to the flower heaven that has been created here, so look at my pics. I am lucky enough to have a very romantic boyfriend who takes me to many romantic restaurants, but Clos Maggiore is unique and will forever have top billing in my mind and heart as the most romantic restaurant. Save up and go here.",

    "text": "Many publications name Clos Maggiore one of the most romantic restaurant in London, & rightfully so; however, sharing the experience of their fascinatingly beautiful conservatory with a friend or family member can be just as lovely. I made a reservation about 45 days in advance, & to be expected, only had my choice of time slots after 9pm. I chose 9:30pm which had the disadvantage of being too late to order the 5-course tasting menu (\u00a365; might've been a blessing in disguise because I couldn't fathom eating another bite after just three courses), but also the benefit of getting a table in the much-coveted conservatory, which is draped in white cherry blossoms. I imagine the chances of being seated here during prime dining hours are nearly impossible, as there are only about 6-7 tables in the area. The cozy armchairs, warmth of the fireplace, & scenery that can be described as a page out of Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" is an experience that we'll look back on fondly. While the ambiance is unbeatable, the food is nice, but not phenomenal. With each course, my satisfaction with the taste of the dish dwindled. I started with Crispy Polenta & Saint Marcellin Cheese, which has an interesting mix of toppings: grilled young broccoli, pickled pears, almonds, & salsa verde. The vegetarian main I chose was heavy & became quickly tiresome: papardelle with grated fresh truffle, mushrooms, parmesan, & truffle sauce. Dessert was a Baked Natural Greek Yogurt Cheesecake with citrus accompaniments, which lacked creaminess & instead had the consistency of a panna cotta. If I could re-do the meal, I'd choose a different main & dessert. The reason for my middle-of-road rating has to do with service. Our waiter was not engaging & disinterested, which made us feel ill-at-ease. Though we saw him walking around, he didn't stop to check on us. We ordered our desserts with a different wait staff member & my requests of no citrus was completely lost. Another miss was interrupting us several bites into our main to add an ingredient to our respective dishes (sauce for my dining partner's pork tenderloin, shaved truffles for my pasta.) I'm perplexed as to why this wasn't done within seconds of bringing out our plates, which seems the customary practice when a dish requires finishing touches. No one can deny the uniqueness or exquisiteness of the room for which Clos Maggiore is known. Their attention to customers (or rather, lack thereof) & unspectacular dishes -- well, those are subjects that are wide open for debate (& hopefully, improvement.)",

The server kept rushing us to order, ended up giving us the wrong table's order, and seemed very uninterested in checking in to see how our meal was going. I specified on the reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary but they didn't do anything special. When we went downstairs after the meal and wanted to see the beautiful conservatory, the servers seemed very reluctant to show it to us even though it was half empty! The food was decent, service was mediocre at best, and the atmosphere is only nice if you get the conservatory. I honestly wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my friends.",

Tuna Tartare - This is not the standard tuna tartare with avocado and tuna chunks that we get in California. To my surprise, its marinated in vinaigrette and serve with zucchini, squash and other garden vegetables. Truly refreshing - 4/52. Triple cooked chips (British call potato fries chips) - Nothing special to be honest - 3/53. Honey glazed duck breast - This is the signature dish and its exquisite. The duck is cooked to perfection, tender and juicy. The honey glazed sauce compliments the duck so well and take away the gamey flavor of the meat. MUST TRY 5/54. Homemade Pasta in truffle cream sauce - They are very generous with the truffles and shave a bunch of truffles on the table side. I have had better truffle pastas but this was above average. \u00a04/55. Creamed spinach - Standard 3/5DecorThe conservatory seating area is very cosy and the lighting make it very romantic. The entire area is decorated in silk flowers to make you feel like you are in a garden in France. PricingThis place won't break your bank. Price is reasonable consider the quality of the food, decor and service. Tip: Make sure to make a reservation in advance and request for the conservatory seating area. Its not worth it otherwise.",

This place has a lovely cosy and relaxed atmosphere to it - especially if, like us, you are lucky to be seated at one of the booths. The food is scrum and the service was attentive without being overbearing. We were supposed to vacate our table by a specified time but the staff were v. relaxed and allowed us to leave in our own (reasonable) time.",

It had been recommended by a friend and was number one in several categories on a restaurant website, so we gave it a whirl. The evening was an absolute dream. The waiters were warm, professional, courteous and efficient without being 'in your face'. The ambience was comfortable; an interesting blend of traditional and modern. The food, however, was what we were there for and was nothing less than divine. The scallops were seared to perfection, a pure taste of the sea, and the black-legged chicken with spaetzle and snails was unusual and so packed with taste-bud twists that my eating automatically slowed down to allow the chance to properly savour each mouthful. Prior to arrival, I'd e-mailed the General Manager of Clos Maggiore to warn them that we were celebrating a birthday. Completely discreet, the waiters didn't let on that this fact had been passed on until the very end of the meal, when Monsieur's dessert was presented with a lit candle and Happy Birthday written in chocolate sauce around the rim of the plate. Since then, we've been back once and experienced another perfect meal. We've also booked ahead for two family occasions over summer. Take it as read that this place is definitely worth the splurge. Keep an eye out for their deals, too, which are so good that you almost feel as if you're robbing the restaurateur.",

Sitting in the conservatory is a must, as you will regret it if you don't. The staff performed very well and the food was delicious. The wine list is outstanding and runs some 85 pages. The downside of that is that many of the bottles in a more affordable price range are sold out. While they do have some fantastic bottles, they run around \u00a3200. There wasn't much selection in the mid-range so the choices jumped from \u00a350 to around \u00a3150-200. Still, they have to be commended for a great wine selection. The only thing that marred our experience and prevents me from giving them a full 5 stars, is that while we had an 8pm reservation, we didn't get seated until 8.30 and had to wait in the very small lobby. While the staff was friendly and kept us informed, I still expected to have a table when I reserved. While the food was delicious and everything did seem reasonably priced for the experience, my starter of wild scallops was a disappointment. Three scallops for \u00a315 is pushing things a bit in my opinion. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone for a special occasion or just a romantic dinner out.",

Relaxed and intimate, with excellent food and a truly intimidating wine list, it is an excellent special occasion restaurant for couples or small parties alike. The decor is great: we were downstairs at the back under an impressive canopy of twigs in spring blossom (not real, but the effect is excellent) and the whole effect is subtle lighting and discrete charm. Good aircon too which was essential on the balmy July evening that we visited. The food was superb with the meat dishes particularly impressive. Service is friendly, efficient and non-invasive and winos can spend hours working through the encyclopedic wine list. This isn't a cheap restaurant, but it is not outrageously priced either - the problem is that with the relaxed atmosphere it is very easy to get pulled towards all the little extras that produce a bill larger than you might have wished! It is hard to regret it though as Clos is a really satisfying place to spend an evening. Highly recommended.",
