However, what I encountered instead was the worst Chinese cuisine of my life. Kung po chicken which had likely been made the day before and which was served lukewarm and tasteless. Ribs that had been likely prepared 2-3 days before were haphazardly microwaved and presented as steaming hot and fresh.The curt service only accented what was a terrible 42 minutes of disappointment and moderate anger.There are dozens of other Chinese restaurants in the area. Please don't make the mistake of wandering into the TPT cafe.",

My boyf wasn't really impressed.However their drinks etc are much better than the food itself. Go there if you like your drinks but don't go there if you want your food. I would not recommend the food there at all :-(",

Attentive, efficient, and helpful. They even came back to the table to double check if we wanted extra rice. Not a ton of ambiance to the place, but this is a typical Chinatown joint in that it is sit, order, eat, and leave. If you're in the area I would highly recommend popping by. They are open from 12pm-1am, so if you've a late night hankering for some Chinatown foodstuffs, they are your place!",

I went here because it was jammed packed full of both round eyed and non round eyed customers. The first good sign is the staff immediately recognised that my family heritage is Cantonese and spoke to me in perfect Cantonese. By the way, just a general rule of thumb, when in a Cantonese restaurant, order Cantonese food. The other dishes on the menu are just there for show. I only speak enough Cantonese to order roast duck and roast pork over rice. About as Cantonese as you can get. Both were very good. Not as good as Chinatown in Amsterdam or San Francisco, but close enough. Prices are reasonable and being open late for the jet-lagged doesn't hurt either. I'll be back the next time I'm in London.Since I was by myself, I shared a table with a local Londoner. We chatted about the inevitable demise of the Euro and how the British were brilliant to to keep their Pounds.",

    "text": "Like Annie W I was umm-ing and ahh-ing over whether to give this 4 or 5 stars. As I'm in a good mood, I'm going for 5. Mum was coming up to London (my little sister was on holiday and she was so bored she'd offered to take me for dinner) and as is traditional, we always go for Chinese. Generally, I'd take her to The Golden Dragon in Chinatown but wanted to go somewhere different. Mum's first comment when we arrived was 'It's TOO HOT!'. Admittedly, it was pretty toasty in there but it also reminded me of being in Singapore which was comforting. There was a little bit of confusion when we were deciding on dishes as we both had different menus. Whilst mum kept complaining that there was nothing on the menu she liked (not really that partial to chicken feet or intestines) I had no trouble choosing. Once the menu issue had been sorted, mum read hers like it was a good book. We started off with your usual veggie spring rolls (I'm not a fan of these so won't comment) and crispy duck pancakes. This was good, although the hoisin sauce tasted more tangy than usual. As is usual in my family, we tend to get a bit over-excited at the thought of eating out and so had ordered way too much. Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs in this case. My Malaysian Laska arrived - a giant cauldron of steaming, hot, coconutty slurpyness. There were beautiful plump mussels, juicy fish balls, strips of chicken and giant prawns. I'm dribbling as I write this!Mum's dish was beancurd stuffed with prawn. And it was so fantastic, mum had to do some crazy Kung-fu Panda moves on me with her chopsticks in order to protect her food. For someone who professes to have 'forgotten' how to use chopsticks, she suddenly became a dab hand. I think our downfall were the drinks we ordered at the start. Pineapple ice was perfectly refreshing after a sticky Tube journey and the Coconut Water with grass jelly and redbean was a meal in itself. The service was akin to a cat eyeing up the next door neighbour's dog. Which is to say, it was pretty good for Chinatown. Our Jasmine tea was constantly topped up, we weren't rushed and even though we didn't warrant a hint of a smile, the staff were patient and polite. Unlike some people, I love this style of service - I'm not a fan of fawning waiters and waitresses. Just as long as there's no blatant rudeness, it suits me just fine. I'd def recommend it - it's cosy, bustling and the food is reasonably priced and delicious.",

So impressed with it in fact, we came here twice! Cafe TPT is actually better than many Chicago places, located in a small but bright and warm two story space. Right when you enter one of the cooks is busy at the noodle and HK bbq station. Pretty awesome.Service is prompt and efficient, food comes out fast and prices are CHEAP! Hits:+Congee great flavor. +Wonton noodle (get the he fen or wide rice noodles). The wontons are HUGE. They stuff each one with like 4-5 shrimp and ear wood mushrooms. Talk about generous! +Tofu hotpot. Altho it claimed to be hotpot on the menu, it was less your traditional hotpot and more claypot. Tofu stuffed with fishcake with thick clear garlic sauce poured over it. So good with rice! +Salt and pepper (w/ slices of chili peppers) spareribs+Mussels in black sauce+Mango sago! (or xi mi lu) Yumm. Misses:-Spicy noodle. They claim it's Szechuan but I could not detect any iota of peppercorn in it. Just some regular old spicy sauce with a small hint of sweetness. Bleh.",

All the desserts are liquid-based, and are served in aluminium-lined wooden tubs - deep ones!Although there are many choices, some dishes differ from another just by the addition of a fruit, or sago jellies. For example, the regular sweet beancurd can come in mango 'soup', with red bean, or with fruit, among several other additions and variations. It's like how salad is basically lettuce, cucumber and dressing, but the British have created Ni\u00e7oise, Wardour, Caesar, which are basically additions or renditions of what is, essentially, giraffe chow.I ordered a tempting 'Mango & Coconut with Black Glutinous Rice & Sago'. The mango & coconut refers to a thin, creamy 'soup' with both flavours. It was served cold as well, and very delicious and refreshing! However, due to the use of coconut milk and the seemingly endless depth of the dessert tub, it's a good idea to come here with an empty stomach.Cafe TPT is definitely a recommended place to visit with friends for a taste of good quality Chinese dessert!",

    "text": "SHORT VERSION: The food was good (I ordered the duck with orange sauce), it came out fairly quickly. But it was extremely fatty, which I know duck often is, but they only give you chopsticks to eat with so there is no way to remove the fat, which is not the melt in your mouth kind, but the really chewy kind). The pieces are also rather large so having something to cut them in to bite size pieces would be nice. The service however is awful, while quick, the staff themselves are VERY rude. They don't talk or really even look at you. They threw the menu on my table as they walked by, without greeting me, and never checked on me or asked if I needed anything the entire meal.- - -IN DEPTH VERSION:I went to Cafe TPT after reading out it on timeout.com/london. It was recommended as an affordable, delicious place to eat in Chinatown. I myself am not super wealthy, and since I'm staying in the city for a month with no guaranteed income, I am trying to eat affordably. So I tried TPT Cafe. Never again.SERVICE: I walked in to the small establishment. No one greeted me. I finally made eye-contact with some who worked there and they pointed to a table, they didn't say anything to me. I sat down and a waitress walked by and literally \"tossed\" a menu on my table. It landed upside down across the table from me seat. I peeled it off (as the table was still wet from being cleaned and the menu was plastic (so appetizing). After a few minutes of looking over the menu (which had an 8 pound minimum order, wish that had been mentioned in Timeout's article), I got the attention of the male waiter (not wanting to speak to the rude Chinese woman who threw me my menu. I guess he was a bus boy because he then got the rude woman to come take my order. I ordered the cheapest thing on the menu that still met the 8 pound minimum requirement (duck in orange sauce). \"Thats all?\", she said. Clearly unsatisfied with my small order. \"Yes.\" I said plainly. WAIT: The food only took about 10 minutes to come out, but I had to ask for water, no one offered it to me while I waited. FOOD: The food came and actually looked and smelled quite appetizing. It was duck with rice covered in orange sauce. The flavor was actually amazing but all of the fat was left on the duck and with only plastic chopsticks to eat with I wasn't able to remove it. They also cut it in to huge (larger than bite-size) pieces, and with no knife or fork or anything other than chopsticks I wasn't able to make the bites smaller. Like a snake, I attempted to unhinge my jaw to fit the enormous, fatty pieces in to my mouth. Failing every time, I ended up with sauce all over my face and other patrons giggling at me from across the restaurant. I'm usually anti fork and knife at places that intend for you to use chopsticks, but at least prepare the meal in a way that is suitable for this. PAYMENT:I asked for the check, and again had it \"thrown\" on to my able. It was barely legible but considering tax is included I knew it was under 10 pounds, so I left a ten and got the hell out of there. I will not be returning.",

    "text": "Sometimes, restaurants can't win. On the one hand, I'm bored with Sino-English generic menus you see in all the main Gerrarad Street restaurants in Chinatown catering for tourists. On the other hand, when I see a restaurant like TPT Cafe offer food from places as afar as Malaysia to Macau, my suspicious radar comes on as to whether the chef in the kitchen can really have such a broad range of cooking experience to do all the dishes on the menu justice.However, with the best English summer rain beating down on me yesterday, I took a hasty and spontaneous decision to take one for the Yelp family and eat here. From the choice of Malaysian dishes including quite traditional dishes such as bak kut teh (pork ribs in a medicinal stock), my eye was drawn to the \u00a38 laksa. Really? \u00a38 for a laksa? Right, the challenge was on.I wonder if they chose the term cafe because the seating is tight - certainly a lot of breath-holding is required to pass between some of the tables! The waitresses were also a bit grumpy for some reason though this just reminds me of the good old days of being shouted at by Chinese waitresses in Chinatown! Yes, really! A bit like John McEnroe, people used to go to places like Wong Kei on Wardour Street to experience the abuse!I had wanted to try their butter soft shell crab but sadly, you have to order 2 of these as a minimum. So, I settled for spicy wonton, which probably represents the fiery Sichuan part of the menu. The wontons arrived looking appropriately red in colour and covered in chopped fresh chilli. There was the promised chilli capsicum heat but not much more flavour other than the sour of the vinegar in the sauce.Then, the piece de resistance. A large bowl of laksa arrived. Now, a philosophical question. How much can you tinker with a dish, perhaps in a misguided attempt to even improve it, before you lose the heart and soul of a dish? Laksa is a famous hawker (street) food dish found in south east Asian countries like Malaysia and Singapore where noodles and small amounts of meat, seafood and vegetables come in a rich, spicy coconut based broth.I can see how TPT are trying to justify the \u00a38 price tag - they added some premium ingredients like green-lipped mussels served in the shell for effect as well as large prawns. However, in adding other things like French beans, the dish has turned into posh pseudo-laksa. The broth has nice seafood flavour but lacked the depth of the best laksa by omitting ingredients such as galangal (wild ginger), candle nuts and belacan (shrimp paste).Street food is best left to its humble but flavoursome roots - the European equivalent would be like trying to turn French toast into pain grill\u00e9 a la francais wouldn't work!I didn't have the requisite stomach room left to try their very tempting range of beancurd desserts.A noble try by TPT and I applaud them for trying something new but I'd prefer a cheaper bowl of more authentic laksa. I may be back for dessert though",

My only disappointment is that they do not open before noon on weekends. \u00a0This isn't any different than most of the other Chinatown restaurants, but it still annoys me. \u00a0Aren't Chinese restaurant owners typically known for being industrious? \u00a0If I find myself lurking around Chinatown before noon and starving, I'll usually go next door to Old Town 97.",

Everything was so delicious and authentic! There's upstairs, probably 2 or 3 tables that could fit 6+ party. Even though the place doesn't look super fancy, but food is good and service was pretty fast. My only complaint: their dessert.We ordered mango with grass jelly- too much mango sauce, very very little grass jelly. Fruits with grass jelly- quite nasty actually.. probably gave me a 2\" square cube of grass jelly cut into tiny pieces, then fruit slushy mixed with probably max 5 pieces of canned fruits. No bueno, don't get! Tofu fa with red bean was... alright... not great. Not soft and silky at all though. Milk tea was good though! A little taste of Hong Kong in a cup, recommended! Mango and chinese grapefruit with sago was pretty good too. Overall, recommended! But be careful what you order on their dessert menu. Everything is pretty reasonably priced, food tasted authentic.

Second time round I had the Chicken curry, expecting a more Singapore kind of a chicken curry.It turned out to be more a Malaysian style, which was a pleasant surprise and very tasty.The chicken comes with bones, I am quite used to eating chicken with bone so no big surprise there. My husband got the steamed fish the first time, it was very tasty and the fish was very fresh. Second time around he got the roast pork, I thought it was too sweet but he liked it and ate it all up.

Stuffed tofu clay pot came to the table bubbling hot. The tofu was silken and super soft but deep fried. Lovely contrast in textures although I would have liked more Napa cabbage.

    "text": "Wardour Street in China Town boasts a couple of eateries that have been easy go-to places for my friends and I whenever we're feeling peckish. First there is the controversial Wong Kei, offering a variety of authentic Cantonese dishes at competitive prices with a generous seating capacity and there is also Misato, a cute and comfortable Japanese option again with reasonable pricing. For that reason Caf\u00e9 TPT has eluded me despite establishing a quiet reputation for decent seafood and an impressive selection of Pan-Chinese cuisine. I ordered the following:- Duck tongues with traditional chilli and salt- Deep fried crispy oyster- Boiled riceThe duck tongues arrived first and are peculiar little things, shaped a little like duck beaks and they make you realise how long tongues really are. I was reminded of eating chicken feet, with their spongy texture which need to be eaten with careful precision, patiently removing bones as part of the ritual. It's an experience that gets better and better with each piece. I think it's a combination of getting used to what is an unconventional dish, being desensitised with every bite whilst also realising how very tasty the sauce is. It has a salty moreishness and spice which brings out the flavours of the fresh coriander and garlic with a lovely tanginess perhaps from vinegar or citrus.The oysters come in a generous serving but have a rather disappointing flavour. They are served with lemon wedges which do nothing for them and even the chilli oil does little to help. These were also billed as being crispy but were actually quite soggy. The game-changing moment however came from dipping them heavily in the duck tongue sauce whereby the limp batter actually helped to absorb the moisture and turned this into a half decent dish.We turned up on a Friday evening and were seated immediately and comfortably with speedy service and friendly staff. Perhaps other dishes may have been better but I didn't see enough to warrant opting for Caf\u00e9 TPT ahead of its neighbours anytime soon.",

We have a fantastic place in Glasgow for dumplings (Dumpling Monkey, check it out if you're ever up our way) and after seeing a photo of the ones here we decided to try it out. The dumplings were good, in fairness, but besides them and the salt and chilli ribs, everything else was just rubbish.The place looked pretty authentic and we could see plenty of Chinese Londoners inside (always a good sign anywhere you go, Chinese Glaswegians certainly know where it's at!) so we had high hopes, particularly after scoffing said dumplings because they were good as I said. Not mind-blowingly good, but y'know, good. I also ordered some chicken satay skewers and I can honestly say that the skewers featured the most dry, most chewy, most disappointing chicken I have ever had in my life. The satay sauce was ok but lacked flavour, and I'm not even sure I ate half of the skewers because I just couldn't face it.Service was abrupt and not very friendly at all, we left slightly hungry and wishing we had picked somewhere else, sad times!!",

Space is a little tight but we did not have to wait for a table. Staff is helpful although there is a small language barrier. We ordered a couple items off the menu. The meat bowls are good. The fried rice was average. Overall we were not super impressed but the food was fresh. Will probably try a different place next time we are in the area.",

    "text": "Mediocre Chinese food. Everything we ordered lacked a \"wow this is actually really good\" factor. I had the roast duck + bbq pork over rice, and it was better than expected but not great. The duck was a bit on the leaner side, but it was well seasoned. The bbq pork was moist, with a sweet and savory kick. They also drizzled the rice with a black sauce that tasted of Chinese all spice and soy sauce.My friend got the wonton noodle soup and it was under par. The wontons had shrimp, pork, and mushrooms in them which was okay, but the skin was mushy and doesn't have that nice bounce you get from good, fresh wontons. The soup was bland and undersalted in our opinion, and the noodles were in small little bite sized pieces. My friend looks young, but she doesn't need to have her food cut for her like a kid! With the abundance of restaurants in Chinatown, I probably wouldn't go back here. I'd rather try my hand at one of the other places in the area with (hopefully) better food!",

The egg fried rice and Kung pao chicken had really good flavor. \u00a0My son had a soup that he really enjoyed and my daughter had the crispy seafood noodles.

    "text": "One of more pricey eateries in Chinatown although decor is no fancier than the typical small Chinese canteen you find in HK. The typical photos of food stuck around the walls of the inside of the restaurant, most being their specialties and more for the adventurous diners or those familiar with the cuisine. Unlike most restaurants in China town they serve both Cantonese and Malaysian dishes although half the customers when we went there weren't even there for a main meal but for their infamous chilled sago and tofu puddings.We decided to give everything a try...Spicy wonton This sadly was quite forgettable. The filling was too coarse with opposing textures of softer prawns and chewy pork. It was lazily made and the chilli sauce lacked depth and complexity.Laksa May have been expensive priced at \u00a39.00 for Chinatown but it was justifiable with the generous topping of mussels, fish balls, tofu and richness in flavour. It was incredibly creamy and satisfying with the fresh bouncy egg noodles that held onto it's consistency even after soaking in the soup. A satisfying laksa overall.Stir fried pea shoots with fermented tofu These were incredible. They were young, fresh and sweet and the fermented tofu sauce on top gave it the depth and saltiness it needed. I'm not really used to such a creamy addition of fermented tofu but whatever they did, it worked. I do miss China though where this dish wouldn't need to have cost me \u00a39.00.Baked pork chop fried rice with a cheesy sauce Flavours of the west to the east and the taste of comfort food. The pork chops were pink and salty, almost like gammon. It was the perfect addition to the more mild creamy cheesy sauce and the fried rice underneath. With such rich flavours I was genuinely shocked that everything was seasoned perfectly, nothing too salty.Pigs stomach with pickled mustard greensThis may raise a few eyebrows but it's that lovely salty tangy soup that is so comforting to have in the cold. It was a dish found advertised on the wall along with their other specialties. The stomach was bouncy but soft enough to chew through due it being stewed in the soup for a while bringing out the umami taste in the soup. The seasoning was perfect. It's a dish that needs time to enjoy and we did.Coconut and mango sagoWe didn't realise the desserts were so popular until we saw everyone scooping out from this cute little white ceramic pot then remember seeing it displayed all outside the window. Sadly I made the wrong choice and ordered the coconut and mango sago which was quite unsatisfying. There was barely any sago, a few mango pieces here and there but mostly just coconut milk, which don't get me wrong, tasted great and creamy. It felt more like a drink than a pudding. Honey melon tofu pudding This was a much better selection. Lovely soft silky chilled tofu against the honey melon pur\u00e9e, adding a strong refreshing sweetness throughout the tofu. So moreish!I did like Cafe TPT and found the quality and portion sizes made up for the extra pounds you pay per meal. Not everything was perfect or creative but we were content with most of our order. Service was friendly and efficient although they do have a bit of attitude but that's just in our culture. Will definitely return for their tofu puddings and their laksa. The place is quite small so prepare to wait if you're dining in a group.",

    "text": "If you like authentic Hong Kong/Chinese food, you'll like this place. Located in Chinatown, this place is small and has the feel of a typical authentic chinese restaurant with cooking going on in the front near the window with a food elevator thing, and just a few tables on the main floor. (you may have to share a table, or wait, or be willing to eat upstairs). I sadly don't remember the menu but what we did order was delicious (see pics for details). We also had some beverages which were good (hot and cold milk tea). The price also is good. The waiter was nice also and spoke english for those that can't speak english. That was a nice change cause as every knows, usually asian restaurants don't give good service lol. Overall, I really liked this place and recommend it. If your in Chinatown, this is a good choice to grab a meal.",

    "text": "The good thing about this place is that it's open late so if you're looking for a meal around 11 p.m. when all the restaurants have closed, you can find something to eat here. The food isn't really good though, but it does the job of filling you up. I had the Roast BBQ Pork w/ Rice and a Tofu Pudding w/ Grass Jelly. I personally prefer my BBQ Pork to be extra fatty, but what I had from them was super lean. There wasn't any fat on it and it was pretty much cardboard lean. Wasn't a huge fan and the rice was okay, it wasn't really moist and sticky but long grained instead. Tofu Pudding was okay, I don't think the grass jelly was a good addition to the dessert but I was craving both coincidentally. I didn't really enjoy it. I also don't think this place was the most sanitary place to eat either, I know it's probably something that couldn't be helped but I didn't appreciate the washroom being directly across from an open kitchen at about an arms length away. The washroom wasn't cleaned very well either. Overall, I'm sure there are better places to eat at for a late night out but this place seems reliable and has a large menu to offer. Average Chinese food at an okay price.",

We went at 10pm for dessert and a rude guy (presumably the owner), said we had to order one meal per pax. We left and came back at 11pm and tried to order takeaway drinks. The same rude guy said that no takeaways are allowed after 11pm. We have to eat in and order a minimum of 2 orders of \u00a38 each (wtf???). I seriously do not understand the rationale of treating their paying customers this way. I would never ever recommend this place to anyone, except maybe to my enemies.",

    "text": "If you've never been to Hong Kong and wanted a little taste of it, this is the place to be. The restaurant front with its narrow opening, roast duck hanging in the window, hot broth steaming next to it...but that's somewhat normal nowadays for a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown right? But once you sit down, you know you're in the right place. A menu tossed at you with the expectation that you already know what you want, \u00a0order quick, eat quick, get out quick. Oh and the noise. Don't expect to hear yourself think, let alone a decent conversation with your meal mate. But what really hits the core is their fantastic food. Admittedly, the food they serve is not actually always found Ina typical HK cafe but whatever they serve is good. Must have? Sichuan style string beans for \u00a37.50. Best I have ever had. Also mango sago with grapefruit and bean curd for \u00a34.50. What! HK dessert at its finest. And the portion is giant (comes in a little cute bucket/pail)Should have? At least one sizzling stone pot dish. No not your typical HK dish but they have a whole listto select from and you simply can't go wrong. We were recommended the aubergine/eggplant with fish sauce and minced pork - delicious. About \u00a39. Things you also should know:- menu on wall that's not on paper- they have a pretty large seating area upstairs great for groups- minimum \u00a38 per person charge- 10% service charge added on top of ur bill- open until 1am!!!4.5 stars. We came here two nights in a row after out HK guest told us she came here two days in a row herself.",
