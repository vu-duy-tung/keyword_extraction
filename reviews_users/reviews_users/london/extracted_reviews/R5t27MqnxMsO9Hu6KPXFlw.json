I had a breakfast sandwich (egg, spinich, cheese, tomato) and my friend had the traditional English breakfast. Normally the \"traditional English breakfast comes with baked beans, but since this is a south african restaurant, they put a new spin on the beans and they were DELICIOUS!! Kind of in a chunky tomato sauce?? Service was great (but we were the only people there that early in the morning). Heard they have a nice crowd at night.",

    "text": "Good, quick option pre or post Buckingham Palace visit. Definitely a tourist spot but they absolutely put out a grand effort! I think I read somewhere... Safari chic. Yes, totally. We kept lucking out, getting the window seat at practically every restaurant we dined at. This was a busy corner just across the way from the Palace, so a fab spot to people watch.It was too early in the day for a drink and we were about to head into the Palace abyss, so we just knocked back a couple a Coca-Colas. Need to say however, the cocktails menu looked amazing. I went way outside my comfort zone and tried the wild boar burger, topped with a quail's egg and spinach \u00a0for \u00a313.00 and had a side of thick-cut chips for \u00a313.60. Man had the Cape Malay chicken curry with poppadoms and fragrant rice for \u00a314.50. As you'll see from the pics I added - breathtaking presentation, however, the food quality was just okay. Not horrible, not great. Just okay. I thought the burger was puffed up to hide what should have provided some really interesting palate checkpoints, but it was pretty bland. Man's curry was pretty standard as well. Most UK restaurants have some sort of curry on the menu, regardless of the cuisine, so definitely had better curry elsewhere. Our meals were very pedestrian with all the bells and whistles to attract hungry eyes. Chips were above good though. I would recommend trying b bar for a drink and starter to share after the Palace tour. Trust me, you'll want to chill out a bit after this tour, particularly after the Crown Jewels queue (yipes). Do screaming babies really have an interest in large, oval-cut diamonds and scepters? Methinks not.Very nice service. Shiny, clean environment. I understand they own the attached hotel which I've read is wonderful.",

    "text": "This restaurant has a special dinner for Valentines day which interested me so I treated my wife of thirty-five years to a special meal. We started with a Ostrich carpaccio with truffle oil as a pre-starter and then, for the first course we shared a platter containing Bobotie spring rolls, with Mrs Balls chutney, grilled lamb and apricot sosaties with curry sauce, and Cape Malay chicken and peanut sauce. We could choose any three of five dishes. Then the palate cleaner which was Rooibos (Redbush) jelly topped with Vanilla Pannacotta. Then to the main course which we also shared from a huge platter. We chose grilled Springbok fillet with toasted walnut oil shot, grilled Boerewors saussages with \"tomato smoor\", oven baked Kingklip (Indian Ocean fish) with citrus beurre blanc and seared lamb cutlets with \"red wine jus\". We could choose any four from a choice of seven. These were served with seasonal vegitables. Finally for dessert, we chose Amarula cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e, warm Cape brandy pudding with toffee sauce and traditionally home made South African koeksisters. Here we could choose any three from a choice of five. We came from an advert in a London weekly called \"The South African\" and because of that were given two glasses of a South African bubbly from the Simonsig wineries. We chose a bottle of excellent pinotage and with the dessert, we each had a glass of Chenin Blanc dessert wine, yes you can get it as a dessert wine! The whole place produced a quiet atmosphere and it reminded me a little of a Pall Mall club! Subdued lighting and a lot of brown wood about. the standard of d\u00e9cor was very good and the only complaint we had were that the tables were too small for two. However as this sort of menu is only for special events, I guess it is fair that they don't make the tables larger. Their standard menu is functional but nowhere near as exciting as this special event menu was, but a whole lot more inexpensive. Our special meal for two, including wines came to \u00a3128 and we came away feeling we had \"value for money\". Service charge is not added which pleased us both a lot as when I tip, I don't work on percentages but on money, so give a higher percentage on low cost meals and a lower percentage on high cost meals. My thinking is the waiter/ress needs a certain amount per table whatever is spent. In fact, now that it is the morning after, we still felt we had excellent value for money. The food portion came to \u00a337 per person and they had really made an effort to showcase good traditional South African cooking.",

    "text": "I'll be honest - when my date suggested a South African restaurant, I was not particularly delighted. I say this as the child of two real life South Africans - I've spent many months in the country and its cuisine is not its strong point. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of fantastic restaurants (I'll tell Yelp Cape Town about them next time I'm over), and a braai is certain to hit the spot, but stuff like bobotie and bunny chow isn't doing it for me*. As expected, I didn't love the menu. Still, about half of it didn't really seem particularly SA, just generic restaurant stuff like steaks or burgers or fish and chips. And these were rather pricey - something like \u00a319 for the fish and chips! This is in line with the image bbar seems to be trying to portray, of being sophisticated and elegant (so therefore pricey). The toilets give away that this is just an act. Anyway, I ended up with a pork belly burger - which in all fairness was gorgeous, if rather fatty. Quick shout out for the cocktails. I had two different ones and my date had two of the same - his was a standard mojito, while one of mine was a berry mojito and the other was a vodka/honey/lime thing. I can't tell you the exact names because the menu on their website has obviously changed. But I doubt it matters what you have as all three were super delicious, as well as being pretty generous glasses. Sometimes a long cocktail menu is a bad sign, but I'd be happy to come here just for cocktails and try out all the sections (even if the South African section does sound a bit bizarre - e.g. the elephant's reverie, with Amarula Liqueur, Frangelico, Bols Banana Liqueur, Fresh Cream, Chocolate and Kirch cherries).*BIltong is the exception. All hail biltong. It's just hard to have as a whole meal.",

I highly recommend for an afternoon drink, tea, lunch, or book reading :)",

First, it is located on a great corner location where you can people watch and there appeared to be a lot of locals coming in for dinner as the rear was packed. We had the drinks at the bar and if you are in the neighborhood I suggest you do the same because if Alex is working the bar you are in for a real treat.Let's face it, the personnel have a lot to do with how an establishment is viewed and Alex \"makes this place.\" He is just a cool, attentive, personable guy and our intended thirty minute stay turned into ninety minutes. We enjoyed every minute. This was basically the last thing that we did in London. When we return, it will be the first.",

We started with a large mixed sharing platter consiting of Beef Biltong, Chiken Livers with piri piri sauce, Bobotie Spring Rolls, Chicken and Dill Skewers and bread. Great selection and plenty for us.For the main I went for the African Burger, which consisted of Wild boar and venison, fried quails egg, cinnamon marog and Chakalaka relish, and a side of fries. If I had known it came on a wooden board, I would have probably asked for a plate, but hey that's just a minor detail.For desert, I went for a Khalua based cream softy drink. It was called a Don Pedro which I now understand is a South African originating cocktail. \u00a0It was really good, and just right after the two previous heavy courses. For a group of 14, we had a great time. I highly recommend, and would definately go back!On Wednesdays it's s 2 for 1 offer of bottles of Prosecco.",

Whilst we didn't have any food, the selection of drinks was great as well. They had most everything we ever needed. Ambience was solid as well.

After searching for flights, we settled on a 16-hour layover in London. We decided not to do any research and to just play it by ear.After arriving at Heathrow, a couple of people directed us to do some touristy things. After seeing the Buckingham Palace, we walked around looking for a decent restaurant. B Bar caught our eye because it seemed to have some nice menu options and it looked very nice inside. First, I'm amazed that it seems like everywhere in Europe offers complimentary wifi, including restaurants and public transportation. The U.S. could really learn a thing or two. Anyway, back to the restaurant. My husband orders the African burger which is venison and wild boar. I took a bite and it was so delicious! I got a regular burger, but I wish I had ordered the African burger because it was so flavorful and tender. Outside of our food and drinks being good, the service was awesome. We obviously had American accents (and mannerisms lol) and we were checked on by the server, bartender, and manager. It wasn't particularly busy, but I still appreciated the attentive service.

Exceptional staff, food, and drinks with an upbeat urban environment. \u00a0The drink I had two years ago was no longer on the menu, but they made it anyway...exactly the way it was. Familiar staff faces reflect pride in the job and quality leadership. Future visits...I'll be here!",

    "text": "B Bar was the best restaurant we had tried in London so far.We ordered their steak, steamed mussels, grilled fish fillet and red wines; we weren't going to eat dinner here at first, but after trying their great red wine and perfectly cooked mussels (decent sizes), we could not resist to order more. The fish fillet was very fresh and tasty, with a touch of lemon juice to bring out the flavor; the steak was super juicy and flavorful, with red, it was heavenly! The manager was kind enough to give us an order of spinach on the house since we didn't order any veggies, it was so creamy and delicious! Of course, finishing up with their ice cream desserts! Customer service was fantastic! They were all very friendly and attentive, just one eye contact, someone came right to us to make sure we needed. Highly recommended!",

I had spinach, grilled sheep halloumi (cheese) and tomato hummus with two hashbrows. I loved that my sandwich was served on a wooden cutting board. The flavors were great. This restaurant was recommended to us by a staff person from the Rubens hotel - and it was a winner.",
