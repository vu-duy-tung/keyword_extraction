    "text": "Eat Tokyo is classic, if I need a quality and affordable Japanese food then this is the place to be. This place will feed the biggest eaters or a hungry stomach. The Soho branch is larger than some of their other branches. May be its new so the deco is nicer. It is definitely in a better location than their previous Soho branch.Being popular it is busy and you will often see a queue outside the street. The staff will try their best to turn the tables politely so don't always expect to be staying around for a drinkd after you have finished your food.The best about Eat Tokyo is the selection on the menu including the hot food. I love their Bento boxes that suit a peckish person like me who wants a bit of sushi, a bit of rice, a bit of salad and a bit of fish or meat.Being Japanese you can not forget about sushi. There is various of selection from the basic to the more creative. If you have a large group or special occassion then their sushi boat is magnificent to have on the table. One of my favourite has to be the dragon rolls and although I have seen other places that does smiliar rolls, it is not as good as Eat Tokyo.It always a good casual Japanese place apart from the queue to get a table so don't recommend coming in a large group. But if its for two to four people I have never found that I needed to wait too long at this branch.",

I ordered the same dish, which was the Chirashi Don (cos' I couldn't stop thinking about it after the first time). My friend went there to queue, they wouldn't let her in before everybody showed up, but luckily we didn't have to wait for long. This one in Soho is new, that was why the decor was better/newer. The food came quite quickly comparing to last time in Holborn. The Chirashi Don was a bit different. Unfortunately, it wasn't as good. The sushi rice was a bit hard/raw, fish was so tough and the squid was like a piece of rubber, I just gave up at the end. I guess it was just bad luck, as my friends's dishes were delicious.",

I ordered the chicken tonkatsu double size. The plate is huge you get twice as much rice, potato and sauce. Presentation is ok. You get a lot of good for 9\u00a3 but the taste is average. Nonetheless I still give it 4 stars for very reasonable prices in a expensive neighborhood. My advice: kick out 50% of the menu and focus and less but better tasting dishes.",

When we asked one of the waitress if she could check with the kitchen to deliver the rest of the dishes we have prefer. She was really rude and didn't want to explain to us and just shoved the order to another server. There were just too many thing that I could complain about. This is probably a good place to come seems the bento boxes have large portions. But others dishes were pretty mediocre. In a word, I don't want to ever come back to this place ever again.",

    "text": "Eat Tokyo is always a safe choice for reasonably priced standard Japanese affair. Although the Soho branch is usually the one I tend to avoid in the weekends being always busy, slow in service and very loud. Over the years it has became so popular that it kind of has lost it's Japanese feel to it. Staff are mostly Chinese who cannot speak good English and the place seems to fail at keeping clean, especially the toilet which is disguising with it's poor water pressure to flush properly. Still, decor remains authentic to the traditional Japanese culture with it's wooden decor. It is a big restaurant too, with separate rooms to drown out some sound and we were placed in one of those rooms, sharing it with other diners. Service was a mix and match. Some staff seems to be affected by the stressful atmosphere showing signs of frustration and unhappiness. However we were fortunate to be given a more relaxed and friendly staff who looked after us well and came back to make sure our food was okay.Yasai itameMainly Chinese leaves, beansprouts and the occasional carrot, generously portioned and stir fried well with garlic, salt and pepper. Seasoning was spot on allowing the sweet flavours of the vegetables to come through. A bit oily which can be seen by how shiny it was. Age-gyoza Being deep fried, it produced a really crispy skin surrounding the outside yet a lovely chewier texture as you continue to chew on it. It was satisfying and a lovely filling of pork that was flavoured nicely with the accompanied diced greens inside.Takoyaki These were nice and plump although the perfect golden crust around it may suggest that they were pre made and then deep fried again to reheat them. Nevertheless the ratio of dough and octopus inside was good, crispy on the outside whilst soft and doughy on the inside. The octopus was nice and tender, all flavoured nicely with bonito flakes for an extra depth of seafood flavour and mayonnaise for a creamy finishUnagi avocado rollNicely assembled using good quality ingredients that gave out satisfying flavours and texture. It had a lovely sweet savoury note, a tender buttery texture which was accentuated by the soft avocado. Garnished with black sesame seeds to give it a smokey nutty finish.Alaskan roll This was more moist and softer in texture filled with a nice oily salmon piece and a juicy bit of prawn. The tobiko surrounding the roll gave burst of saltiness as well as a richer depth of flavour.Pork cutlet curryWe ordered a large and it could have probably feed four. Beautifully panko fried pork, crispy and golden brown revealing a lovely juicy tender pork cutlet inside. Curry sauce was generous along with the fluffy potatoes and soften carrots. It has all the nice savoury and sweet notes we're used to and enough of it to mix in with the rice given.Oyako jyuThis has never failed me. The chicken is always cut into big chunks to keep it moist and tender, always the thigh too which my favourite part. All cooked with lovely caramelised onions in a lovely sweet soy, mirin and dashi sauce before pouring a beaten egg to give it a velvety creamy texture.Buta kakuni This was the only disappointing dish of the day being very tough, stringy and dense. You can say it wasn't fatty enough so the meat didn't marbleised. The soy marinate was nice just shame about the meat itselfSapporo RamenGenuinely surprised with how good the ramen was. Described as miso soup ramen it had depth and umami from the underlying chicken broth which also gave it the sweet flavour. Greater depth of flavour was achieved by the toppings of fatty tender pork belly, sweetcorn, bamboo shoots, wood ear fungus and garnishes of spring onion. Sadly the egg was not the soft boiled ones you usually get. Noodles were from a high quality supplier though being fresh and bouncy.I do love Eat Tokyo but sadly the atmosphere and hygiene lets it down and so for that it loses 2 stars. Depending on where you are you might not be able to hear the person next you due to the high noise level. Only use the toilet if you have to as it says toilet paper should not be flushed so you see all sorts in the bin next to you. Half the time it is blocked anyway for those who do not follow. But it is a great place to organise a large group meeting as large portion sizes caters for sharing and lots of small dishes too. Prices are pretty decent too. I would recommend to make a reservation on the weekend or turn up early as it can get really busy and you might have to queue.",

It's rather mediocre and it's quantity over quality. The sashimi platter on the boat is good value but again it's nothing special. There is however a good selection of starters, from fried food, salads, sushi and grilled meats. The main has wide selection as well from rice, noodle dishes, bento boxes for those who want more of a variety and tempura. Verdict is to go if you're super hungry and looking for something cheap.

But my friend suggested this place, promised the queue moves fast, and despite arriving at prime dinner time around 7:45 PM, we were seated within half an hour. I think you can book a table as well, but it wasn't like a reservations mandatory type of place, and the tables turned around surprisingly fast. There is also a little stand outside with a book of authentic Japanese restaurants in London, and of course Eat Tokyo's locations are recommended in the book. It's funny that such a book exists, but Japanese cuisine has become so mainstream that it is refreshing to come to a more low key, almost hole-in-the-wall place like this.The menu is a little overwhelming; it is basically a book of laminated pages with pictures. And there is so much choice. A bento ranges from 10-15 pounds, but there are also endless options of sushi rolls, ramen, and appetizers. We ordered a sushi roll, edamame beans, and gyoza for the table, and then the others each got a bento / ramen and I got a eel and ikura hand roll, fried oysters, and black cod with miso. I enjoyed everything, but I must say, the fried oysters impressed me because it was an extremely generous portion with 5 large oysters served with salad. The others struggled to finish their meal and a lot of rice was left over at the end, but we all left very full and content. For all that, including three pints of beer and a tea, and tip, it was only 25 pounds a person - what a bargain!",

But on the plus side, the portion of beef was good, and the beef tasted nice, to be fair. One other thing though, I found the pricing kinda strange, slightly random. some dishes were really cheap while some others were quite expensive?

    "text": "This is my first time going to an Eat Tokyo branch that's not been Holborn but I had originally been to this chain many times before and the food has always been excellent. So far, I would like to say that this branch was better than Holborn in every respect in terms of food, atmosphere and definitely staff friendliness. The main waiter who served us was someone I knew previously at Holborn Eat Tokyo, Kim, but as I understand it, he's mainly based at Old Compton. I only saw Kim once at Holborn at that experience was much better than the others at that particular branch.Kim even remembered us from before which we were all delighted about as we spoke very highly of him last time. You'll be very lucky if you have him serve you as he's always very funny and very helpful with recommending such orders to you. As an additional bonus point, he even sang the birthday song with us for one of my friend's birthday which I should commend him for great singing. Eat Tokyo were able to accommodate a birthday cake and we were not rushed to eat our food at all - no set time limit given to us even on a Saturday night unlike Holborn! The food was delicious as always - I, whilst opting for a more Chinese-styled dinner (I don't eat seafood so I was stuck for choices but that's my own problem, not the restaurant) rather than authentic Japanese, still thought the food was an amazing. I ordered chili egg plant, mince pork and rice (Mabo-nasu), a great option if you like spicy food and have seafood allergies. The spice was excellent but not enough even if I had asked for extra chilli - that's not their problem though because my chilli intake is very high. A friend of mine actually thought it was too much spice in contrast. Note that the additional chilli cost me \u00a31.50. I also ordered 6 vegetable spring rolls (Harumaki) which was cheap at \u00a32.50 - unfortunately, my friends were quick to help themselves that I didn't get a picture. These were crispy and just perfect, faultless. My friend's dishes were all delicious I am told - My only slight gripe was that the kitchen served a fish dish to one of my friends food when he asked for no-fish as he's a vegetarian. This was quickly resolved so no problems. I most definitely will be back again at the Compton branch and I think I'll pass on the Holborn one from now on where the service is not comparable even if the food is the same - I remember the last time I organized a birth cake cake at Holborn Eat Tokyo, one of the staff members actually brought out the cake in the bag and ruined the surprise, which annoyed me. Note that this is not a reflection on Kim as he wasn't there on that occasion. As always, I'll post up the photographs of the food that we enjoyed.",

    "text": "This place is one of the more well known places for Japanese food along side Misato so expect to be queuing on the busier days like Saturday evening for instance. This branch was originally based in Whitcomb Street near Trafalgar Square which was a lot smaller than the new place.The menu has a wide range of choose from sushi, noodles, bento boxes and especially katsu curry which comes either in chicken or pork and also has a regular or large serving. The menus themselves have their old school binder look to them but are informative as they show a picture for most of the food they serve.For starters I had the Korokke which is a breaded potato croquette served with salad and a sauce on the side, which went great with them. For the main dish I had the Chicken Katsu Curry in the regular size and was surprised on how much was on the plate.Eat Tokyo prices are affordable for the most part with sushi rolls starting at \u00a32 and thee regular size Katsu Curry being \u00a37 and \u00a39 for the large. So I recommended coming at off peak times to get the best service from them as when it's busy they can take some time to getting to your order and can get hectic as well.",

The location had changed to Soho with a larger space -- a much needed change since when I last went, we had to wait an hour just to get a table. Food was solid as always. I ordered udon and California rolls, both of which hit the spot for me. What I generally like about Eat Tokyo is their authenticity -- no bells and whistles, but simple and just as they would serve it in a Japanese household. All this for a reasonable price too. Service was prompt and good overall, though toward the end, I got the feeling that they were trying to rush us out so that they could serve new customers. Understandable, but not the best feeling. Would go back for a low key, quick Japanese fix.",

    "text": "With Eat Tokyo in Golders Green being one of my favorite places to go for japanese in Londo, I was excited to hear that they had opened up another location in Soho. Upon my first visit I was greeted by a small que, but it moved quickly and within 5 minutes we had seats by the bar, which is really great if you're only two people. While overseeing the jovial chefs at work, we dug into the hefty menu. At first the excessive amount of choices can seem a bit daunting, and also give you that sense of a Chinese-place-that-does-pizza-and-sushi-and-fish-and-chips-and-none-of-it-is-any-good, but the experience here is really quite the opposite. There is a lot to choose from, but it is all thing I long to see in any other Japanese restaurant. From pumpkin croquettes, to nasu dengaku, natto, some wonderfully crispy and flavoursome gyozas, and a healthy choice of sushi, sashimi and ramen, Eat Tokyo does most things pretty well, and some things better than most. As restaurants in Soho generally tend to up their prices in comparison to other affiliated locations, I was happy to see that here they are pretty much the same as in Golders Green. The staff are attentive and very friendly. The chefs even manage to say goodbye to you when you leave, despite the steady stream of orders and precision with which they make the food. When it comes to what to order I'd say try it all. This is a great place to go with a larger group and sample things you might not have had before while still getting something your familiar with. The bento boxes are great value, but maybe not that much of a thrill. It's better than Wasabi, but really, you get what you pay for. I love the different larger rolls that are perhaps not strictly authentic Japanese, but combined with the right starters will be a great eating experience. The one with avocado and eel is terrific! The Nasu Dengaku is a bit too sweet for my taste and works best if shared, as its richness will be a bit overpowering as a whole. This is definitely my go to space when I want to know what I'll get for a good price in the area. I'd also recommend you to go there even if it is slightly out of your way. I'd even say that this beats many of the fine dining Japanese options around, but that all depends on what you are after. You're not going to get an experience of complex and surprising flavours here, but you will get good quality food with a no fuss approach that still pays attention to detail. Now all I need to find is a decent Yakitori restaurant and my foundation of Japanese eating in London will be complete.",

Seriously, don't.It may have been my experience only, considering the rating gave by other people (no it's not, that's just something I say for politeness).Came here in a group of 6 people, rude attitude from the waiters (that's ok in a chinese restaurant, abysmail in a japanese one) at the entrance. Bad N*1Menu is 30 pages long maybe, dirty and in plastic folders. Seriously, it looked more like the notes that spread around a class at university rather than a list of dishes. Bad N*2Dishes and beverages arrived with 15 minutes of delay one by each other. Not the way you want to eat, staring at other people eating and then being watched while doing so. Bad N*3Food was very low quality at best. Tempura was greasy, oily and fatty, very low quality. Sushi was badly prepared, rice falling in pieces as it was too hot (and not just slightly above room temperature as it should be). Salmon was average quality, but tuna was really bad quality. Fresh, but low quality.Just don't come, if you want to eat sushi there are tons of places better than this one, if you want to eat katsu just go to Misato (compare my review there with this one please!)",

There is no elevator to take you up, up, up to a view of London. There is no \"fusion.\"There's just a really big menu, an efficient (if unpredictably friendly) staff and spot on price point for what you get.When we came on a Friday night I was thankful we had a reservation since the line was out the door (and kudos for even taking reservations for parties of 2 - not many Central London places do it for fewer than 6!). When I came for lunch I was thankful my 8 pieces of nagiri and glass of wine only came to \u00a324. A place like Sushi Samba I would have gotten half that (and no drink).The menu IS overwhelming if you don't know what you want. There are bento boxes and chef's rolls and nagiri and ramen and lunch specials and curries and on and on ... It is also a messy presentation because the plastic sleeves which contain pages and pages of items (with photos) are in a school binder. There is no slick branding or carefully selected typeface. But it is damn good sushi. It is a place that offers something for everyone.",

I ordered the following:- Sea bream sashimi- Rainbow roll- Genkotsu-AgeThe sashimi is fairly standard as is the rainbow roll (an assortment of uramaki/nigiri style sushi made of different fish) which isn't a criticism. These tick the boxes for those times when you crave sushi but doesn't go much beyond. The genkotsu-age on the other hand is an interesting take on battered and fried chicken, for those like me who enjoy things like gristle and cartilage for the added crunch as these include soft and edible bone. Served with Japanese mayonnaise and a slice of lemon, I would highly recommend this as a side or even as a snack with a beer if popping in for a light meal.With a menu the size of a small encyclopaedia there are simply too many items that I haven't yet tried to give Eat Tokyo a fair rating but from a sushi point of view, you can find better elsewhere.",

It's one of those gems that I feel bad exposing it to the world but I realise it's pretty popular in the Soho area anyways so it doesn't matter. Bento boxes are a must-try and so is their whole crab (which cost only \u00a37)!!! Had a wonderful experience with the food coupled with some funny posters I saw in the loos!However, this place was packed before and after we finished dining and servers kept coming to our table to check if they could take our empty plates away as a strategy to free up the table as quickly as possible. But servers were polite in times of rush so props to them",

    "text": "I went into Eat Tokyo on a whim because I was seeing a play nearby and wanted some Japanese. Boy was I impressed! First of all the menu was EXPANSIVE. I mean I've seen big menus at other sushi places but this menu is a binder full of options. The service was ok- just based on the servers who I talked to, the women were very nice and the men were a bit curt.I ordered two inari which were yummy; they came out very quickly. Then I got some vegetable gyoza which were perfect. The bottoms had just the right amount of crunch and the tops were just soft enough. I also enjoyed the sauce they served with it. I then got my vegetable tempura bento box which came out really well. I had a few minor issues with it: the carrot tempura was a bit under cooked and the tofu could have been crisper and/or more flavorful. But otherwise I loved it. The tempura batter was superb! A vsweet woman asked if I wanted any desserts and she sold me on trying two different mochis, one mango and one green tea. They were so good! If I had made them I would have made the outside a little thicker, but that's just my personal preference. Also the green tea mochi had a very strong green tea flavor, which wasn't bad but it definitely was unusual.All in all this place was really quite good. It wasn't perfect (as I mentioned in my notes above), but I would definitely frequent Eat Tokyo if I lived here.",

Tried to stay safe with the beef bento, but miso soup was bland, tofu was dry, salad was old and tired, and beef was drowned in salt. It's worth walking a bit to find somewhere better - don't waste your time or your stomach here.",

    "text": "Came in just before last orders last night and was greeted and shown to the bar. Being late, the teriyaki and curry were both gone for the day, but it wasn't really what I was looking for anyway. The menu is large and has pictures so nice and accessible for everybody.I ordered two different types of roll, a spicy tartar roll (fresh chili, salmon, tuna and white fish), and an eel/avocado roll as well as the katsu jyu - breaded pork cutlet and egg sauce on rice. The sushi came quickly and was freshly made (I was sitting at the sushi counter) and I had enough time to eat it before the main dish arrived. The fish seemed very fresh and I enjoyed the crunchy chili inside the roll as well as the standard wasabi and soy. They were well put together and didn't fall apart or seemed squeezed into mush. The Katsu Jyu was huge though, 2 pork cutlets, sauce and rice. I needed to actually move some of the cutlet to the sushi plate in order to enjoy the dish fully and get at the rice. Slightly odd addition of bamboo shoots in addition to the standard onion, but not a bad extra. It could have used a little more sauce though, it seemed a little thin on the amount of rice given.Service was quick and they dealt with a large number of people coming in. They announced last orders and a short while later carried out the threat (the waiter seemed quite happy to announce the closure of the restaurant for the day!)One gripe I have, the doors don't close unless someone really pushes them closed. The seat that I was given at the bar meant that I was constantly in a draft of cold air from the outside that was channeled through this gap. I was close enough to get a chill and far enough away that I would need to leave the bar in order to close it. And even though the door would get closed, the problem would start again as soon as someone else came into this popular restaurant. Try to avoid sitting there!",

Everything was delicious to the point I really can't pick a favourite and for \u00a315 that is costs you really get to eat a lot of food to fill you up.I have been telling everybody about it because I think it's a great place for Japanese food and you should definitely go there!
