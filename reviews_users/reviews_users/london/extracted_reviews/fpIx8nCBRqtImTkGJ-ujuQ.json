    "text": "I've been to Morito a few times now and every time I always leave wondering why I don't go more often. The food here is incredible and represents great value for money.Yes, you'll have to wait - but as mentioned, you just put your name down and sashay across the road to Caf\u00e9 Kick and enjoy a beer or two and wait for the call.I don't think I've ever had a bad dish here. The lamb with aubergine and pine nuts is one of my favourite things I've eaten in London. The chiccarones are a must if you're a fan of fried pork. I had the sumac baby squid last week and it ranks up there with best squid I've eaten.Vegetarians have a few really good options here as well. The fried chickpea and pumpkin dish is simple and incredible and the grilled tetilla cheese with walnuts is awesome - as if a slab of grilled cheese wouldn't be. Morito is a tiny spot and they don't mind packing people in, so be prepared for a little physical interaction with other people during your meal. However, they're totally cool with you taking your time to finish and enjoy your food, even if people on the waiting list aren't. Highly recommended.",

It's a pretty ideal place for me (if too expensive to visit on any sort of regular basis). I always liked sister and neighbour restaurant Moro but prefered dining at the bar when there. And that's what Morito is - just a bar with killer Spanish and Moroccan tapas, great wine, sherry, beer. Croquetas are ace as is the tortilla and the specials on the blackboard are of the drool-worthy variety. Grab a light snack over a draft of Cruzcampo or pig out over some major Iberican creations with a bottle of fino. Bueno.",

Spartan dining accommodations with a \"hole in the wall\" decor. The staff are super, working at hyper speed and non-stop the entire time we were there. Every plate had its charms: the chiccharones were juicy and crisp; the lamb, aubergine and yoghurt was perfect; artichokes flavorful; and although the sea trout could have been more inventive, it was nicely cooked. I'll second every other positive review.",

Better for dates, it would be hard for a group larger than four as it is very cramped. And although the staff was friendly, they were so busy they weren't overly attentive. \u00a0I would recommend ordering your tapas at your own pace cause they bring it out at once. Ordering three at a time worked well. It's in a great area in Islington, so although it's small and they don't take reservations, put your name down and go for a drink. If you need to wait, it's worth it!",

    "text": "I went here on a Friday night with a friend. It was rammed and they had a waiting list with ten people ahead of us, but we put a name down anyway and had a pint at the nearby Wilmington Arms. Maybe an hour later we checked back to see how close we were and we were the next on the list so we decided to stay.We were sat at the bar facing out the windows, with lots of Exmouth Market onlookers passing which made us feel a bit like zoo animals, but most smiled so it wasn't too off-putting.The service was quite good through the meal, we ordered maybe five or six tapas dishes along with drinks. The lamb-yoghurt-pine nuts dish was absolutely to die for, and the pork belly was very good; however, we also chose an octopus one which was a bit bland, and the bread basket with some kind of tomato sauce was underwhelming. The other customers were very friendly and made some good recommendations, including an aubergine dish and the fried calamari which we unfortunately didn't try.At the end of the meal, we asked our waitress to recommend some sherry. The order got a bit confused, she only brought us one glass instead of two, and we asked for a sweet and a dry sherry, but on the bill it came up as the same and she said that we'd ordered the same thing when we asked for the names of them. We had tried each others' and were both quite convinced that they were different, so I think she brought us the right thing, but forgot that they'd been different.Overall a good experience and I would go back. I thought the sherry was expensive at \u00a38 a glass, had we not ordered that the whole meal would have come in at under \u00a335 for two with drinks. This is cheaper than the associated Moro next door, and the heavenly lamb dish for \u00a35 definitely makes it worth it. However it's quite cramped, so I wouldn't recommend coming here with more than four, ideally two, and you should definitely book.",

These were simply cooked leaving the flavours to the vegetable dishes. deep fried aubergine went very well with pomegranate and the spinach/red onion/raisin/pine nut dish was worth every mouthful. these were so good we went back for more. the morels (mushroom) were not as interesting. The flavours in the salads/vegetable section seem to be really well thought through. I agree with below comment that the wine list is a little limited but I found the same in entrepot (hackney downs stn) and that is part of the borough wines gang (although you can ask for more from the wine shop). We sat near the chef who was happy to chat once it had quietened down. all the staff except one (too cool for school) were really friendly. the girls beside us also were definitely enjoying food and atmosphere. absolutely worth a return",

    "text": "For photos see swedishmeatballeatslondo\u2026  A couple days ago I decided that it was finally time to eat at Morito, after it'd been on my eating list for a long, long time. Arriving at 7.30, the place was crowded but we managed to get the last seats. Right by the door, which to be honest was a bit annoying, because every other minute a gang of hopeful people would open it and try for a table, and it was a cold night so the draft was not too pleasant. Well well well, wine was cheap so it didn't matter much. We started off with jamon and chicken croquetas, salt croquetas (what can I say, I quite like croquetas!), and some butifarra sausage with beans and aioli. The sausage and beans needed a bit more seasoning but were great sprinkled with the dried chilli on the table. Then, puntillitas (baby squid), fried and served with lemon. I loved these! We ordered some more - pork fillet with jamon and padron peppers (nice, but nothing special), seared venison with piquillo sauce (awesome!), some tomato toast, and two absolutely amazing vegetable dishes on recommendation of the waiter: beetroot borani with feta & walnuts and chickpeas with tomato, chilli & coriander. I really, really loved these, the beetroot dish was bright and beautiful and so fresh. Morito doesn't take bookings, and was just awarded a Bib Gourmand, which makes it even harder to get a table. I loved the food and the informal setting, but didn't love having nowhere to put my coat (having to sit with it in my lap all night...) and sitting by the drafty door. The tables at the bar looked amazing, next time I'll definitely go earlier and try to snatch a table where I can watch the chefs cook.... All in all Morito is cheap(ish) and cheerful, with superb (if a bit confused at times) service and food - I'll be back.",

Fresh, balanced and thought through. Especially loved the fried octopus, salt cod croquetas and the tortilla. Dispappointed with the tetilla & walnuts. Portions are small but it was enough to fill 2 people... ie about 4 tapas per person. Very reasonable price comparef with Brindisa. \u00a370 total including a gorgeous not too sweet colosia cream sherry at the end easily generously poured.

Service was great, the atmosphere too (bustle and noise congruous with a tapas bar) \u00a0this is a good place to hang out and have some drinks with some tapitas. Yes, tapitas, because the portions are small and the prices quite steep. The food was good though, if not outstanding. The wine list was very disappointing \u00a0we tried all but one of the reds and they were all relatively dull and poor value. This is possibly the biggest failing because I'd come back here for some drinks (with some food), rather than some food (with some drinks). If you get what I mean?! So, removing one big reason to come back (lack of decent wine \u00a0and by decent I don't necessarily mean refined, cheap, chunky, & cheerful is good too!) means I'm less inclinced to come back. Barrafina remains my pick for a special night out, El Parador for something more down to earth, but do give Morito a try.",

Nothing extravagant but all in all really good small plates, but filling. We weren't huge fans of the dry sherry but gave it a try to start. Ham and chicken croquettes- tasty with rich sauce oozing out. Good starter. Lamb salad- really nice shredded lamb Crispy aubergine- really good flavor and textureFried cheese- need I say more? Went well with the bread. \u00a0Would recommend coming early so that you can get a table. Was full by 8pm. Minor complaint was the lack of backs on the chairs.

As for food, we had the bread basket, chicarones, turkish salad, quailed egg with cumin and fried baby squids. All of them were just delectable to say the least.The chicarones meat was tender, savoury and well seasoned as well as the fried baby squids. The turkish salad plate of cucumber and tomatos drizzled with mint and yogurt dressing was wonderful and refreshing pair to our unhealthy food choices. We also enjoyed the variety of bread (flat bread with herbs, rolls and small egg crackers) that came in our bread basket. What a wonderful place to enjoy a beautiful day in London!

    "text": "I sat down today at this small tapas restaurant with high expectations based on its zagat rating. I was not disappointed. Although seating space is limited, the ambiance of the restaurant was fun and energetic and the food completely surpassed my expectations.I arrived just a few minutes ahead of Morito's 5pm dinner opening and was the first one through the door. I picked a seat at the bar and enjoyed hearing the staff playfully ribbing each other over some the outcome of practical jokes. While looking over the menu in ordered a glass of dry sherry to cleanse the palette.My first item was a sort of amuse-Bouche: \u00a0a small stuffed pepper full of goat cheese and a mint leaf. Delish! The flavors worked really well together. I could have eaten three or four of these.Next was a small plate of shredded spiced lamb, served over pur\u00e9ed eggplant and topped with pomegranate seeds and pine nuts. As good as my first dish had been, this one was even better: We're talking knock-the-ball-outta-the-park amazing.About this time, I noticed that the place is obviously very popular. Twenty minutes after opening and there's not an empty seat in the house.My third selection was a perfectly grilled cheese adorned with walnuts and a slice of some kind of fruit terrine. At this point I started to question why I would ever eat at any other restaurant while in London.Next, I wanted something light to close out the savory portion of the meal and the waitress convinced me to try the fennel, orange, and monk's beard salad with a Spanish dry white wine. It was also very tasty, but I struggled to tame the wild monks beard and bring adequate combinations of flavors to my mouth. I had been planning to sample something from their dessert menu lastly but I just couldn't manage another bite. Will have to leave that experience to my next visit, which will hopefully be quite soon.",

    "text": "How we were able to find ourselves seated on the smallest of small seats bunched in with a handful of other hungry diners wanting both food and shelter from the wintery gusts outside I will never know. But the hand written menu on the white tiles above the chefs hard at work signaled they were keeping everything fresh and but with limited availability as a waitress put a line through another of the dishes.What set this place apart from the standard tapas places dotted around Central London is two-fold. Firstly Morito is the little brother of a restaurant located next door named Moro and both dining destination in their own right blur the lines between Spanish and Middle Eastern. Morito reminded me of a cross between a butcher shop and a tapas bar pulled out of Andalucia. White tiles and harsh lighting for the fit-out around the bar and sides while basic wooden tables and chairs take the rest of the available space.Halfway through the meal WordMonkey looked at me and smiled. What amazing food. The place wasn't even on our radar - it was a suggestion from John and Coran who were our fine dining friends in London. These boys have their finger on the pulse of the dining scene.As you can see the dishes are small but easy to be shared and so fresh that the chefs will sometimes lean over the counter and hand you the next terracotta plate and take you through the dish. These guys were busy which made me wonder why they decided to open Morito immediately next door to the famously successful restaurant Moro. Yes it is run by the same peole but given the option people are going to head to the cheaper option. Moro was empty in comparision to the packed-to-the-gills Morito.Back to the excellent cooking. The next wave of dishes arrived and I was particularly impressed by the chiccarones - small squares of pork belly flavoured with cumin. The fried chickpeas (sounded boring), recommended by both the boys, came with chopped tomatoes, chilli and coriander, and were a spicy, crunchy, compulsive treat.Other dishes included looked a little something like this: Spanish wine served in glass tumblers was good - helped along by the fact we had visited Cafe Kick which was just across the alleywayfrom Morito. Previously an ex toyshop it transformed itself into an authentic continental bar. Over time customers have helped decoreate its walls bringing back football flags and bank notes from all over the world.Happy Hour is 4-7pm every day and they cook up a mean cocktail - even though they may look toxic. But they bring everyone together on the foosball tables dotted through the interior. \u00a0you will see little old ladies going head to head with suited bankers fresh from the city - it really is a free for all.We ended the meal with on a high after which we were well and truly fed and watered.In total we ate our fill of around ten courses between the four of us which may sound alot but the dishes were quite small. Genuine, ambitious and innovative cooking, and funky location, Morito ticks all the right boxes. I just wish I was a local so I could duck in here for a quick dinner in transit to and from home.",

This can make for some frustrating as you might have to wait for a table (you can't book in the evening) but this is not too much of a problem - the staff take your mobile number and give you a call when you should return. When you do return, you realise quickly why you were waiting a menu of tapas delights, both classic and inventive, almost always results in you ordering (and consuming more than seems feasible. For me, the best place to sit is at the bar. That way you get to check out the handiwork of the chefs. My favourite dishes are the lambs chops (you just have to pick them up and get up close and personal) and the lamb and humous (flat bread on the side is compulsory). \u00a0The specials are almost always good as well. \u00a0To finish, vanilla ice cream and a glass of pedro ximinez. \u00a0Perfect!",

Every emerging tapa trumps the last, it's hard to keep up but the chorizo scallops, baby squid, Spanish omelette and cod croquettes were of the most memorable... ah but then that wouldn't really be fair on the chiccharones pork belly or lamb aubergine... Waste nada! -Be sure to order a warm bread basket to soak up the succulent marinade vestiges.You won't be disappointed with any order here, but I do recommend going with a larger group in order to maximise the variety of plates and to empower you to point and request what the neighbouring table are tucking into, or the food envy will consume you.",

I found a few of a dishes to be similar (but not as well made) as Barrafina's. Specifically the shrimp, the clams and the squid. The maitre 'd was on a serious power trip that night. Being short and uncourteous, despite us being 3 girls, trying to smile and get him to shake off the black cloud over his head! That was a real mood killer and there is NO REASON to ever be rude to people who just want to enjoy their night out. The food is good but it is a very cramped space and I would not return, simply because there are plenty of other places in London that have miles better service! (Like Barrafina!)",

    "text": "Unlike bigger and slightly more upmarket neigbour Moro (the one your parents will really approve of) there are no reservations at the orange formica clad bar, where sharp elbowed trendies joust with local suits for space to pile their terracotta plates and baskets of fresh soft roundels and densely spiced flat breads made in Moro's bakery next door.The bread is essential. Warm if you're lucky, moreish either way. It soaks up the fresh olive oil bottled on each table and its soft, open structure is perfect for scooping up little piles of za'atar (a piquant Arab herb mix on the table with the salt). The za'tar is a giveaway that this isn't a typical tapas bar, but one heavily influenced by Spain's Southern and Middle Eastern neighbours.We started with one of the most remote of these influences, a soft, silken, oil infused Iranian Borani. Pureed beetroot with feta, dill and walnut was a perfect accompaniment to the breads and vanished swiftly with another Moorish dish of soft spiced lamb mince served on creamy roast aubergine. Lest there was no crunch to the meal, we sampled salt cod croquettas, soft fish yielding under a buttery breadcrumb carapace so good we followed it almost instantly with another plate, this time of jamon and chicken, a little too mushy inside but forgivably so. I was less forgiving of a dish of Butifarra sausage. Four thin discs drowning in an over oily mass of soft white beans, oddly tepid and served with a splodge of garlicky aioli.I can never resist pimientos de Padr\u00f3n when they appear on a menu, here a good value \u00a33.50, hot, flame charred and oiled like tiny green Lucha Libre wrestlers, the rare 'Hot One' threatening to kick your throat in. No luck tonight, though they provided a sharp salty contrast to a menu a little steeped in oil and cream. A final hurrah came with a small wooden platter of crisp baby squid. We realised half way through that they were whole, inch long tubes of fried fry or battered baby. Either way it felt like piscine infanticide on an epic scale.Busy and buzzy even at 9.30 on a Tuesday night there was a wait, this really is somewhere you stumble into rather than a planned 'eat at eight' mission. If you want that, go to the slightly more upscale Moro next door. Just make sure you eat well enough to drown out any envy of the snake hipped youth hanging outside.",

I also got a seasonal beetroot and rhubarb salad. Creative and tangy.My friend got the puntillitas. Good by English standards but the cuttlefish could have been juicer in my opinion. Not sure if they over fried or if the fish was not as good as in Spain. Finally, the tender stem broccoli with anchovy sauce and peanuts was also very good.Get the olives for snacking: I think they had been home preserved!

    "text": "Amazing tapas bar!Took our chances and tried to get a table at 8 pm on a Saturday at this tiny tapas bar in Exmouth Market. We had about 1 hour wait as they don't take bookings, which we spent people-watching on the bench outside with a Negroni. Tables are kept for groups, so if there's 2 of you, you'll be seated at the bar. Which is nice too as you'll get a view of the kitchen. As it was so busy, the staff was a little stressed running around but they tried to serve us as best they could. We asked for some recommendations and then ordered away. We definitely over-ordered but I'm so glad we did because we ate some seriously fantastic food that night. The menu changes daily and from the 6 dishes we ordered, my favorite was the \"crispy aubergine, whipped feta & date molasses\". The aubergine is fried crispy, but so very delicately so it's not greasy at all. Combined with the salty feta and the sweet date molasses - just wow. So, so good. A must for the table and easy to share.The charred cauliflower, green tahini & toasted seed dukkah was a really nice side dish, although we didn't pick up much of the tahini. Still good though. \u00a0The cod with garlic potatoes wasn't my favourite, but my dinner date loved it. I preferred the mackarel with asparagus which had a great citrusy sauce with it. My friend, who eats meat, had the spiced lamb, aubergine, pomegranate & pine nuts. Too full to even get through 1/4 of it, took it home to finish (lucky gal). What a pretty dish. To finish our meal we had the grilled tetilla cheese, mebrillo & walnuts. This is so rich and so satisfying. Hot melting cheese... could only eat a little as we were stuffed but it was amazing. Morito was so worth the wait, we were both really impressed by their dishes! Reasonable prices too, especially if you're a large group sharing dishes. Would definitely come back, probably not on a Saturday though.",

    "text": "Morito's 4th Annual Seafood Festival runs throughout the week to bring the taste of the sea to London with their sherry and seafood pairing. Seafood has been the core at Morito's heart and I have been a fan of Morito's cookbook. The recipes that I have tried have made regular appearances at large dinner parties, as well as a flair of elegance for a romantic dinner for two for Mr L and myself. I could not be more than excited when my friend took me on this special seafood menu paired with sherry! The sherry started off with a very dry and light. Throughout the meal, it got progressively darker in colour and taste, sweeter. Manzanilla Gabriela, Sanchez Ayala mojama & ajo blancopastirma cured fish & picklessmoked anchovy & brown butter montaditoI would not want to drink the Manzanilla Gabriela alone because the dryness is a little rough. In fact, the first sip took me by surprised at how dry the sherry was. However, with the fish dishes - cured, pickled and smoked - the edge of the roughness was taken away. It seemed well rounded. The mojama and ajo blanco was very good and well seasoned. While the traditional ajo blanco is served with grapes or melon, I think that the mojama (salt cured tuna) was just as pleasant, if not much better. \u00a0Fino en rama, Gonzalez Byass pulpo a la gallega steamed mussels with turkish pepper paste and bulgur - the good thing about mussels is that they are simply delicious and easy to cook. You can hardly go wrong unless they are gritty and unfortunately mine were gritty. The fino en rama was a little smoother and rounder compared to the first glass. It was served chilled in a frosted glass. Now, was that just the difference that it gave? Would the Manzanilla Gabriela be just as good if it was chilled? So, I brought it up to room temperature to test it but then later forgot all about it because dessert was served. Oloroso, el Maestro Sierra, 15 anos whole roast fish with saffron, honey and sweet vinegar, fennel rice and shellfish aioli - the fish was nicely roasted. It was not as sweet as the menu reads with honey and sweet vinegar. In fact, it tasted really quite light and was overpowered by the white fish. The rice, when you bite it was tough and when you sink your teeth into the centre, it was floury. A definite sign that it was undercooked, not al dente as they probably would have liked it. I think the shellfish aioli just salvaged it. Yup, a good dollop with it and undercooked rice could even be forgiven. The Oloroso itself was quite dense and sweet. It is a classic situation where I \u00a0prefer the Oloroso on its own and the fish dish on its own, just not together. What went very nice with it was with the oily aioli. It brought everything all together. So, in the presence of the aioli, it worked. Pedro Ximenez, El Maestro Sierramalaga raisin ice-cream - with the generous amount of Pedro Ximenez, I was surprised that the ice-cream still had ice crystals in it. A cold ice-cream with a warmth of that Pedro Ximenez made me strong enough to take on the windy London by night. I felt it could have been a more educative and fulfilled evening if we were given more information about the sherry or why they had chosen it rather than only reiterating the name and walking away hastily.If it was solely based on this seafood menu as their fanfare, I am not sure that I was as impressed by the restaurannt I was cooking from Morito's cookbook. Overall, the quality of the food was good. The servings of the sherry was also very generous. But I still would prefer to make a concluded opinion \u00a0 about Morito after I had a proper dinner.At \u00a355.00 I felt it was a little dear. And I'd certainly like to be seated more comfortably instead of high stool bar seats.",

Only 4 seats at the bar were available.(There are 5 tables for 4 and around 17 seats at the bar).They don't take reservation. So you couldn't possibly take a seat depending on the time.But it's a Spanish tapas and some diners come and leaves quickly.A bit cramped, noisy and bustling with people so we had to talk loud. The stools we sat on were not really comfortable.... But never mind!!! All these could change into no problems once you taste their food!! \u00a0 Ordered:iberico bellota/puntillitas/beetroot borani,feta,dill&wallnuts/cod croquetas/mint pea & yoghurt soup/spiced lamb,aubergine,pomegranate & pine nutsThe plate was spotless by the end of the meal! Many of their dishes were with a creative modern twist.Not just simple at all. So you could enjoy the taste never being bored with that.A must-try of the above are \"cod croquetas\",\"beetroot \"spiced lamb\"!!! They were each bursting with flavor and had a taste I'd never eaten.I'd definitely come here soon and regularly. wanna try all menu they have ; )",

    "text": "I really want to give this place more stars but I just can't as a) the menu online was slightly different from what I was given when I was seated and b) the aubergine fries were incredibly bland apart from the sweet sauce and yogurt accompaniment. I decided to sit outside tonight on this pleasant Monday evening and chose one of the benches against the wall. Not the most comfortable place to eat but doable. For starters I was so disappointed the fig and cheese dish I saw online and walked 30 minutes to get was out. It turns out the daily menu is posted in the AM but changes halfway through the day or late afternoon for the evening and that is not reposted. So the dishes that ran out at lunch- such as the figs- wouldn't make it to the evening menu. Disappointed, I ordered the beetroot, dill,walnuts and goat cheese dish and this was what the full three stars is for. It's lovely. I am not a huge beetroot fan but this won me over with the flavour combos. I devoured the whole thing. It's perfectly light but so very tasty. I also got the crispy aubergine and man, what a letdown. The fries themselves are totally bland. I mean literally, no flavour except for the kickass, slightly sweet dressing (like BBQ sauce) and creamy yogurt dots that are fantastic. I love the dressing alone but even they could not save the fries. :(The service was prompt which I appreciated as well. It's a tiny establishment and there are no reservations.",

The menu changes daily according to season and what's available. The vibe is friendly and casual. Perfect for friends catching up or a low key second day.My favorite tonight is the spiced lamb with aubergine pur\u00e9e (kinda like #babaganoush texture) pomegranate and pinenuts - it is light and flavorful. The #octopus with #tomatoes and #garlic rusk was perfect texture and #scrumptious. Oh and don't get me started with the pork secreto. Yup, the \"pork secret\" - iberico porkshoulder. It is true to its name - the #bestkeptsecret of #Spain ! It is #tender and hint of #smoky. This is the first time I have it and won't be the last! \u00a0To finish strong we got the \u00a0slow roasted #pork belly in mojo verde. Too fatty to my liking but hey, \"fat is the new candy\" I was told. \u00a0Cherry on top, nothing on the menu costs more than \u00a310 ;). Wines are mostly below \u00a37.Come early as they don't take reservations.Ps place is small don't come with a group more than 4.",

    "text": "I prefer the more relaxed informal vibe of little sister tapas bar Morito to Moro (next door). They are both on a charming Exmouth Market street, bustling full of cute shops and great world eats. From great pizza, brunch, Portuguese to good pubs.Firstly I had a sensational tapas dish from Morito Tapas. Beetroot, feta, dill & walnuts. Think this one is a game changer from the salad and veg menu. May have to create this one at home. Tastebuds going Lady Gaga over these combinations.I also had some superb dishes that included potato bravas, jamon croquettes, pork belly, tortilla, bocadillo and classic tomato bread. All excellent. Very authentic and tasty.I sat at the bar on stools. Not the most comfortable but when the food is this good I don't mind. I think most best tapas places are best enjoyed at the bar anyway. Thumbs up all round.",

We sat at the end of the bar right in front of the chef which was the best seat in the house. All dishes were sooooo flavorful. They use a lot of sumac, chile, cumin here for a beautiful blend of North African and Spanish flare. We tried the 1) seared lamb steak, hummus and flat bread, 2) spiced lamb, aubergine, pomegranate, pine nuts, 3) globe artichoke & coriander salsa, and 4) octopus, tomatoes, and garlic rusks. I will order all again and again, especially my fave the octopus. I like light cocktails and loved my rebujito (fino, fresh mint, lemonade). Shocked at how affordable this place is for a true tapas bar and definitely the more comfortable laid back spot next to Moro. New fave restaurant!!",

If only they had more dishes which excited the tastebuds like this did!However, while very good, several of the items did not overwhelm with excitement. The best of those items were the scallops, the pork belly and the chickpea salad (the latter of which got more addicting as you ate it and made for a great sharing plate). Don't bother with the goat cheese & honey plate, the lamb chops and certainly not with the quail eggs which are actually just that: quail eggs which you have to peel yourself. Wine was very well priced. However, the restaurant itself is closet sized and couples of two are only allowed bar space. The good news is, we were quickly sat on a Saturday evening!",

Me and my partner went quite early, around 6:30, and can only sit at the bar because the tables were saved for bigger parties. You can watch the chefs cook your food tho. The service was definitely friendly and attentive. I thought the price was fair but maybe Im just getting use to London now?While the food was definitely not just Spanish - they were all delicious. The lamb chops actually tasted exactly the same as Uyghur-style lamb skewers (the version without sichuan pepper), something I desperately missed and did not expect. The lamb and the pork belly were both cooked just right, and a combination of juicy fatness & meat - so heads up to those who only want lean meat. The refreshing cocktails were much needed during the heat wave. Am definitely coming back again!",

The deep fried aubergine covered in whipped feta is a must-try. And for the carnivores, try the lamp chops and the slow cooked pork belly - both are tender, bursting with flavours, and oh-so-delicious. The biggest downside is the cramped space and stylish but not-so-comfortable wooden stools, which makes sharing in a group a very snug affair. If you are going as a group, make sure you're no larger than a foursome otherwise one of you will be sat in the middle of the narrow but busy thoroughfare between the table and the bar.",
