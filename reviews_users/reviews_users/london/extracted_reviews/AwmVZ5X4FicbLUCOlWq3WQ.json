The Ravi Shankar is spacious, with wooden tables and benches, but still pretty packed so get there early. The food is of course wonderful, and all vegetarian. If not having the buffet, there is a wide choice of dosas, which here seem thicker and more filling than at neighbouring restaurants. The only downside to this restaurant is that there is segregated seating at lunchtime, so that non-buffet eaters are not allowed to sit with buffet customers - so that if one of your party doesn't want the buffet you have to split up. But the buffet is pretty special and it would be silly not to try it.",

There were at least 20 different selections, I was drooling right when I walked in. \u00a0 I love all the different flavors that are offered, and all the creative ways they use chickpeas. \u00a0Also, their spinach dish with mushrooms was AMAZING. \u00a0I am in love with this place, and it is only 6.95 pounds, and only a 5 minutes walk from Euston station. \u00a0My boyfriend even loved this indian buffet and he usually hates vegetarian food. \u00a0They also have a pretty decent desert selection!I will DEFINITELY be coming back on my hungry days, and it's cushy on the wallet as well! \u00a0This is better than any indian buffet i've had in Los Angeles as well! \u00a0I am definitely coming back here as much as I can!",

Then i reminded him that I ordered Mysore Masala dosa this idiot said yes that's what it is. I am just coming from India and he thinks he can make me fool by saying anything. I trusted this waiter and took the plate and it turned out to be Just masala dosa and taste was horrible. I ate the dosa alone by leaving the potatoes as is, Sambhar was cold and stale, may be made in the morning. What I noticed also that people who are running this restaurant are no where close to India, forget about the south india where dosa originally come from, so that says it all that they are confused and making others fool on the name of Indian food.

From said menu I chose the Shankar thali as I was were there in a big group and it's easy to order. I generally like the variety that a thali has to offer (it's a high-sided metal tray with 5 or so metal dishes inside, each with a different curry, and a large metal dish of rice). I've eaten quite a few thalis here and there, and this one was, well, it was OK. A bit greasy, not much variation in flavour or appearance, but on the whole edible. The gulab jamun was nice, however, but there was only one in my dish! If I had to I'd go back (i.e. another post-conference dinner), but I wouldn't choose to go there again. If I did maybe I'd try a dosa, as a previous reviewer recommended.",

It's not flashy or particularly luxurious, the decor is sparse and plain, but the food is very good. They offer a great buffet for one, or two, with delicious breads, stewed pulses and rice. You'll be charged around \u00a36 for the pleasure, which is very cheap, especially considering the area. They also offer a wide selection of fresh juices, and specialist Indian health drinks.

I just didn't consider it until I found myself in this area, with a vegetarian friend.Although most of the reviews are about the bargainous lunch time buffet, in the evening they serve lovely thali as well as a whole range of dishes from around India, including dosa. I looove dosa, and there aren't that many places that offer it in the UK, so I ordered a spinach and paneer dosa for \u00a37ish. \u00a0Noms:- We ordered some onion bhaji and samosas which were both really good.- My dosa was really tasty, and huuuge!

    "text": "DISCLAIMZ, PEEPZ:I've only been here for the buffet. No a la carte for me, nosiree.For just under a sevenner (if tenner is a thing, why can't this be the term for 7GBP?) you get full access to the buffet which consists of hot dishes and cold dishes (savoury), and a range of desserts. Don't miss the condiments though! I can't tell you what they are, but hot red and cooling white, and green and coconutty and and...ALL THE CONDIMENTS!\"Endless combinations\" --- overheard from another table. FACT.The hot dishes include dosas, chick pea curry, saucy paneer, fried pakoras, dhal, and deliciously fluffy naan to name a few. Don't miss the aloo palak, Indian potatoes with spinach! Cold dishes feature aubergine, various salads including my favourite with preserved lemon, and, well...some \"mystery\" things that I don't really know WHAT they are precisely, but they are worth some testing out. The basic premise is: you get a metal plate, canteen-style, walk up, fill to heart's content, repeat as needed.Indian/Pakistani desserts are not my usual go-to as I find them overly sweet, but I appreciate that there is fresh fruit as an option here, as well as a loose rice pudding-ish option (YES) and the standard - wait because this is not the actual term - donut holes soaked in sugar-syrup. Even if not to your taste, worth doing a little culinary adventuring. Someone else commented that the drinks are not the most competitively priced; both the wine and the lassis, for instance, I'd happily give a hard pass to. Instead, ask for a pint of tap water which appears at the table in a Cobra beer glass. Yelp note: just to be clear, my carnivorous friends...this is vegetarian. Vegetarian!",

    "text": "Top Notch Indian Vegetarian!I am not a vegetarian having always wanted meat on my plate. However if the vegetarian food was as good.. ahem.. well maybe not the main \"I\" chose... I would be a vegetarian every day. Ravi Shakar was a famous traditional Indian musician so it is a bit sad that there is no music here but maybe that would make it too cheesy. The starters are just amazing and most have yoghurt and tamarind and have a sweet and sour taste with a mixture of crunchiness. They are not spicy at all and I think we could have eaten each one and been happy without a main. It reminded me of the street food that Rick Stein had on his visit to India. We ordered three, the Bhel poori, the Paani Pooris and the Potato Poori. For some reason the staff gave us four dishes and when asked admitted to making the mistake with a smile and gave the fourth for free :-) Wow, that's the first time I can remember being treated so generously in a restaurant. If you are going here try the Dosa's such as the Mysore Masala Dosa and the Spinach and Paneer Dosa. South Indian food to me is all about Dosa and not curry. The Dosas \u00a0filled with spiced potatoes or with indian cheese (paneer) and spinach and are very generous. The Rava onion Dosa, which was my choice, I would not recommend as its full of what I thought was plain boiled Onions with no spices at all. Luckily for me my wife and our friend were willing to share :-). Sadly we could not indulge in the exotic Indian desserts as we were too full so will have to go there again soon.The price is just amazing as the total between us was \u00a312 each and we walked away with some leftovers for breakfast. Of course this did not include drinks which we brought with us as they do not sell alcohol. The service in Ravi Shankar was excellent as they were quick, \u00a0they were friendly and happy to crack a joke. Well worth another visit.",

Two of us had a couple of the thalis, letting us try numerous things. \u00a0I was stunned at the daal, not one of my favorites, but here spiced very well, just a slight bite that augmented the lentils really well. \u00a0Everything else was good, my wife, who isn't big on hot foods could eat everything, and I found it spicy enough that I didn't need to ask for something hot on the side like I usually do. All of the dishes were prepared well, nice mix, and extremely satisfying meal The chai after was also very nicely spiced \u00a0Recommend it highly - almost as good as going to Bangalore, and a lot closer",

    "text": "+ Indian vegetarian buffet restaurant near Euston + Great value for money  Ravi Shankar is an Indian vegetarian restaurants on Drummond St. just off Euston. The restaurant is situated on a street with at least four other vegetarian Indian buffet restaurants. I have no idea if they are in any way related to one another. In any case, for under \u00a37, its buffet is exceptionally good value for the money. The d\u00e9cor is basic but service is friendly and efficient.  In addition to all the usual currys and naans, it offers a variety of warm dishes. It is delightful to see so many different ways to cook vegetables. Anyone who believes vegetarian food is just bland and tasteless would find a nice surprise at Ravi Shankar, and perhaps any one of its fellow establishments on Drummond St.",

After a few minutes of waiting, they got us a table (in a VERY busy restaurant), and we hit up the buffet.So as a plus, this buffet has dosas! So that's always a yummy yummy bonus. However, I feel like the selection at this place was subpar compared to others nearby. They also seemed to be out of a lot of food, and nothing was really getting replenished. And for a buffet, that's not ever a good sign.Since we were seated upstairs, the service was pretty poor as well. We ended up having to get up and head downstairs to pay, as we barely saw a server.I mean for \u00a37, I don't expect a whole lot, so I'm sure I'll be back if someone wanted to, but for me, this is probably my least favorite buffet on the street so far.",

The waiters were really fast ... maybe a bit too fast ... as the menu is extensive and had some unknown food on it. I needed time to study, but we had someone pop by our table on a regularly 2 min interval. It's not really a place to linger and have a slow meal with a long discussions about the existence or non-existence of the human conciseness in a Descartes universe. Not that I ever have these discussions in a restaurant ... that's only for posh wine bars.I also agree with the review before: The tables are tiny. Even without a computer we had problems placing all our food and drinks on it.On the other hand the food was fast, hot and very yummy! Really a place I would like to go back to.",

It's one of those 'all you can eat' offers that proliferates around Drummond Street with most costing around \u00a37, including a desert or two. It was pretty packed but I found a table for me and my shadow. The guy who greeted me was a bit miserable and clearly wanted to be somewhere else, maybe in a Bollywood movie crooning some maiden. He was elsewhere for sure ... but I know the routine and didn't need 'service', so just get outta the way dude!You grab a large metal plate and then have the tricky job of deciding what you want to major on. It's all veggie here so I'm happy. You really won't be stuck for choice. There is maybe every South Indian veg option ever invented available! The rice is good quality, the curries tick all boxes taste and looks wise and there's nans, popas, dosas to dunk.It's one of those places where you sample lots of little portions rather than slop on just one or two. All are tasty and 'home style'. I had a sweet lassi, which was Ok, par for the course, and a few bits from a somewhat average tasting but decently wide dessert selection.All in, I spend less than \u00a310 including tip and enjoyed it. I kinda wish my was stomach was bigger 'cause I could have gone back for seconds easily. So, it's maybe no great shakes on the service or decor side of things, but top marks on value.",
