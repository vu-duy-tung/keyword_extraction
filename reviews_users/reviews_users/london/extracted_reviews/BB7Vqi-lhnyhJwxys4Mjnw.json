The garden is mainly gravel with a fair amount of seating although not the place to have a private conversation due to it's lay out. The best feature in the garden is a an area set aside for boules, this is sanded and the boules are available behind the bar. A fair amount of hospital staff drink here. I know this due to the garden seating! There is a limited menu available, although i've never eaten here.",

    "text": "Finally I got my Canadian better half onto the Heath and to the other side for a Sunday drinkie last weekend. Destination: the Garden Gate. It was so popular that it was suggested that we went there again this weekend, this time though we treated ourselves to a pub lunch. I was buying so off I went to the bar to order from the limited but mouth watering menu taking a good look at people's plates en route. I timed it badly, having to wait 10 minutes to be served by the sweet but lack luster staff (the experience was rather better than last week when an elderly lady standing next to me helped herself to a handful of my chilli rice crackers soon as they had been placed on the bar in front of me). I guess I shouldn't have been surprised that I would be told that it'd be a 45 wait for our food to arrive. What was surprising was when it arrived within 25 minutes. I had the beef roast, great value at comfortably under a tenner, generous and delicious. My girldfriend had the beer battered fish and chips, served with mushy peas and tartar sauce. She was equally delighted and so generous that greedy me had to find some room to finish off hers. I've only eaten here once before about 9 months ago, with a group of friends, all of us having one variety or other of the roasts and all pleased then. I can't be sure but I think the one area of the menu that disappoints are the salads. The lady sharing our table with her family ordered the goat's cheese salad and was heard to be complaining about the size and quality- the salad was undressed. This is a great pub in a great location. Get there early if a) you don't want to have to fight for a table outside if it's that time of the year, b) don't want to have to wait for food and c)don't want to be told that they have run out of a lot of the food.",

SO GOOD. we had a large table of 10 and for how busy the pub was, i was very impressed by the table service we received - we were never left waiting for drinks and were asked several times how we were finding things. in my experience you can wait forever for roasts to arrive. not so here - it wasn't ridiculously quick, but definitely a manageable wait. i ordered the nut roast and it was seriously delicious. for the quality and amount of food, i'd say \u00a312.25 is a reasonable price. we all had roasts round the table and everyone was happy with their own choices.several of us shared cheese boards after dinner which were plentiful and good value at \u00a37.i loved it here. i will definitely be back.",

The beer garden is huge and beautiful and in summer there can be a great atmosphere here. The staff are friendly if not a little slow sometimes but the beer and food are OK, good for a pub but again as this is situated at the bottom of Hampstead Heath I had higher expectations. Another thing that shocked me was the presence of some ruffians kitted out in their chav trainer and trackie combos. I think this pub has a lot of potential and i hope someday they will realise their potential. However, it's still a nice place to stop off for a sociable drink or two.",

    "text": "The Garden Gate pub has one of the best beer gardens in London. Fact. Not only is it ginormous by London standards, the garden has these cosy, sheltered seating areas as well as mixed up garden furniture out in the open. So come rain or shine, you can enjoy one of the many speciality beers or ciders (on tap) outside, breathing in the gentrified Hampstead air. They also do great barbeques during the summer. Inside is also very handsome-looking too, as befits the pub's 19th-century age - think heavy wooden tables and chairs and imposing leather sofas. In terms of food, the Garden Gate has followed in the footsteps of other gastropubs and serves a daily-changing menu, usually featuring hearty British classics such as quality meat and two veg or battered fish and chips. I had a veggie roast once here on a Sunday, and it was a very posh roast indeed: potatoes (both roasted and mashed), buttered green beans, carrots, cauliflower cheese and an enormous slab of nut roast, filled with crunchy goodness. This is how I imagine Hampstead residents eat all the time. Oh, and for those of us from areas less affluent than Hampstead, there's half price wine on Tuesdays!",

I've seen the roasts and must go back on a weekend to try. Because it's out on the main roads, you'll get more of a mix of people rather than just locals but they've got a lot of space so even when it's busy, you can still manage to stalk out a table and claim one relatively quickly.",

Others in our group seemed to enjoy their meals, but I would have sent mine back if I wasnt so hungry. I ordered salmon/crab cakes with beetroot salad. They were the smallest I have ever had in a restaurant, almost black on the outside & tasteless. Nothing fluffy or light about them. The salad consisted of lettuce leaves, tomato quarters & pieces of beetroot floating in a sea of oil. No balsamic or usual dressing, just pure oil! I'm not a huge eater, but had to buy a take-away on the way home as this meal left me so hungry. I suspect mine was a dud meal, but I'd be cautious about eating there again.",

I can't comment on the inside as I didn't actually go in!We ordered some food off their rather eclectic menu. Perhaps a little try hard for the kind of pub it was, but regardless - it was super tasty. I had a rilette, which was very tasty and my Mum had the humous.. which was warm.. which was a bit weird. I mean - it tasted nice, it's just I've never had it before.The guy who brought us our food was very friendly though and obliged my Mum's conversation about the type of tomatoes in her salad in a very charming manner!",

Most of it was definitely microwaved and not even lashings of gravy could save this shoddy Sunday classic.It gets really busy so I understand that table service isn't an option but the little service we experienced was just OK. We will go back , but only for drinks.",

I first discovered The Garden Gate some years ago when I met up with some Australians who I'd previously met on a cruise. Bar staff have always been quick to serve me. Love seeing the dogs come into the beer garden. Old fashioned and richly-decorated pub inside.",

Not for its yummy menu, or abundance of outside seating, or pleasant staff, or location or even its twinkle lights (Come on, admit it, you gotta love a little bit of twinkle)! But what I absolutely love about this place is their weekend BBQ. Their jerk chicken is absolutely delicious! On a sunny weekend it's pretty packed - so probably a good idea to reserve a space in advance if you can.",

    "text": "Came here last night before heading to the Everyman cinema for a drink and dinner. It was my first time, and I'm glad we went - I would definitely return. They had a delicious section of beer on tap; I can't remember what we got, but it was a white beer, and a really good one at that. For dinner I got a half roast chicken; my partner got a steak. The chicken itself was very good - though the white meat was a tad dry. However, the chips that came with both meals definitely tasted frozen :( Also, the gravy for my chicken didn't come until I was about 1/4 of the way through my meal, and the baked tomato that the menu listed never showed up.We couldn't find a seat outside, so ended up inside, but the outside looked fantastic. Very green, set away from the street, nice breeze, etc. Inside was nice, until about halfway through our meal when the lights suddenly dimmed? We couldn't figure out why. Maybe it was the switch to \"evening mood lighting\" as some places do, but this was a bit too dark for comfort - and felt out of place in the environment. Overall though, a good meal, delicious beer, and a nice place to sit. I'd really like to go back for the Sunday roast based on the other reviews!",

    "text": "Today I possibly ate the best sunday roast of my life. No kidding. Granted I was a little in need of nutrition after a debauched night out but wow, wow, wow, am I dreaming of that gravy or what!? With hints of orange and rosemary and the high probability of looking sounding like a twat, the delicate flavours filled my gob with joy. Actually I think i want to bathe in it, Garden Gate do you think you could muster up a bath full of the stuff? Thanks, that would be great. It's so hard to find a good sunday roast in London. It's all about the meat, veg selection, the all important Yorkshire pudding. The Garden gate ticks those boxes. For about \u00a39 you can have a mountain of chicken, pork or lamb, perfectly cooked and served in the sunshine. This is ideal outside dining. They even have a BBQ going on the weekends over the summer. I've been to this pub a few times and it's always busy. Don't let that put you off, wait a while and one will come free. I promise you its totally worth it.Not only does this pub have an awesome selection of ales but also cider and beer. All served by super friendly staff. After a walk on the heath, it's the perfect way to spend a Sunday.",

Their menu changes monthly but always features classic pub food with a gastro twist (recently: butternut squash and gem lettuce salad with a chili dressing) and, on the weekends, a barbecue where they cook to order. It's lovely to sit outside on a sunny Saturday with a jug of Pimm's and some friends - the garden is great for groups, with lots of long tables and benches. They also cater parties in the garden.",

You might go one day and service is quick and friendly. On other days there may be only two staff on the bar but the queue of people 5 deep.If they could get their service up to par (especially on weekends) the star rating would go up.The inside is nothing special, in fact a bit of a wreck and the bathrooms are not the best.Overall, great for grabbing a drink when the weather is sunny and warm outside but be warned, you may feel cross by the time you get your drink to enjoy outside.",
