Located just near Bond Street in a road perpendicular to Selfridges I'd say Princess Gardens is a hidden gem of London. Yes the dishes tend to be slightly pricier than what you'd find at the yum-cha places in Chinatown but bearing in mind your surrounds and the extremely good quality of the food its not such a bad price to pay (and on this occasion the price tag didn't even hurt that much coming out at only \u00a314 each!) Surprisingly (surprising because I thought I'd sampled most yum-cha offerings before) I even tried out a few new dishes including Shredded Mooli Cakes (why haven't I eaten these before - they are delish!), Cuttlefish Cheung Fung and a couple of desserts - honeyed deep friend lychee and some wierd donut dumpling thing with banana and red bean. Nice for a change.",

Firstly, you can't help but love the fantastic design; glass windows circle the entire building allowing you to see the stream of shoppers and workers pass by, the bar is beautifully designed and is well stocked with premium spirits and the restaurant itself is large and welcoming with crisp lines of design and some great artwork on the walls. Secondly the menu is fantastic whether you dine from the main menu or choose the dim sum option. Prices are not too steep for those who aren't able to claim it as expenses and so would not discourage those who have found themselves quite far down Oxford Street and desperate for a decent establishment. Finally your hosts are extremely professional, the service is immaculate and not at all intrusice so whether you're chatting with a friend or discussing business you are never distracted by the service. A gem in Mayfair.",

It is a few cuts above any other Chinese restaurant I have been too. The wine list is extensive too, with wines to suite every dish and price range. There are classical Chinese deserts, which are presented incredibly well, as is all the food served. The service is immaculate, and the restaurant is always quiet, and traditional wooden screens can be put up around your table if you require more privacy. The prices at this restaurant are very expensive but this is a high-end restaurant and they are no higher than any other restaurant of this type.

    "text": "I ate in the restaurant for a weekday dimsum lunch with a friend who is also a yum cha fanatic. The first thing that put me off was the slightly snazzy entrance. It made me think of Royal China, which while it does serve very nice nosh, is overpriced and has less selection than your average Chinatown dimsum bar. Give me basic surroundings and good dimsum, not vice versa, I say. The food was actually quite good. I'd say near Royal China quality, although as another reviewer (rosieonvacation) points out, it does all lack the taste and punch of the real deal that you can eat elsewhere, like too far in Soho's Chinatown. They do not serve shark's fin dumplings either, which while pleasing eco-warriors may displease some dimsum gourmets. The other problem is the service. The kai-lan we ordered with our dimsum never arrived and when we re-ordered it a very small plate of it was brought. Once we got our bill shortly thereafter we realised the few chinese broccoli we HAD got had on their own added more than 8 pounds to the bill! It ended up being over 20 pounds a head for a rather basic dimsum meal for two. That is just more than it should be. I doubt I shall return, but for any Royal China fans that get a dimsum craving while in Mayfair (and have cash in their pocket), or indeed those who need to entertain business contacts and need a certain decorum in their restaurant, this may be an address worth bearing in mind.",

I have been here quite a few times with friends and the trick is to come with a decently big group of people (I found 3 to be the magic number). The dim sums are shared so price per person is usually around 14-15 GBP which is decent in my opinion. The grub: So I have only ever had dim sum here. But it's the reason I go back constantly. They have an amazing selection of dishes (wider than some of the other places in the city). And they do the classic dimsum dishes like shumai really well. I loved almost all the things I tried here (which is quite a lot to list) but special mention goes to their char siu buns, chaofun with wrapped dough stick and egg custard tarts. Definitely recommend this place if you are interested in some authentic, finger licking dim sum",

    "text": "What I loved most about Princess Garden was the atmosphere - such a lovely change from the usual, uptight environment of dim sum places in Chinatown and Royal China. Although it was lunchtime on a Saturday, the place wasn't crowded at all, and was rather peaceful.The restaurant is filled with oriental statues and antiques, has a lovely reception area, and is not ram-packed with tables. The dining area had natural light, with a conservatory feel. The waiting staff weren't rude as one would expect in a Chinese eating place in London, and were decent and helpful.Prices were in the average zone, with most dim sum dishes less than \u00a34 a plate, but portions and size of food were a little bit smaller when compared to other dim sum places. The xiao long bao (soup dumplings) were in reality nothing more than regular chicken dumplings, which was disappointing.The place did not serve liu sha bao, (steamed buns with runny egg yolk filling) which was a shame, but they did have steamed custard buns, which had a more solid custard filling which just couldn't match up to a liu sha bao.I went with a company of four, which is not a good idea for any dim sum place! Most of the dishes come in portions of 3, which is a challenge to split between four diners. ('Let's halve that egg tart... oops. Do you want the side with more egg or...?')Overall, Princess Garden is located on a posh, quiet street, and is an absolute pleasure to dine in if one wants a quiet afternoon with friends (headcount within multiples of three please) over average dim sum.",

Perhaps it was the luxurious sofas in the waiting area, or the modern high class bar behind it, but something about the entrance of this restaurant screamed sophistication. The rest of the place did not disappoint either, with tables spaced well apart (the same cannot be said of Chinatown restaurants), very conducive for a quiet lunch or dinner. The dim sum menu range was quite extensive, with all the classics like har gau and siew mai, char siu bun to cheung fun, as well as some unique dishes. We ordered a range of staple dim sum dishes, and were not disappointed with the quality. It was good dim sum that tasted freshly made and with quality ingredients, with the key being that after the meal neither of us ended up with dry mouth, which is a common affliction in cheaper Chinese restaurants where they use MSG and flavour enhancers in the food.",

    "text": "Having been a loyal fan of Royal China for nearly a decade, I have been trying to find alternative restaurants that serve superior dim sum. Princess Garden of Mayfair was recommended by some friends from HK, and naturally, I went with high expectations.. I wasn't disappointed with the dim sum spread.. they have a wide selection, and some truly interesting dishes on the menu. However, taste wise.. do not expect it to be as salty/tasty as dim sum served in other restaurants. I was surprised to find the food a little on the bland side - it seems as if the chef had opted for quality and freshness rather than heap his creation with a generous dose of salt and MSG. At first, I wasn't very used to the blandness, but as I continued to eat, one thing struck me - without the distracting overtones of MSG, my palettes could make out the freshness and natural taste of the food. It was refreshing, to say the least! While I'm not going to forsake Royal China dim sum, I have to say.. I'm happy to have found a gem in Princess Garden of Mayfair. I will definitely look forward to going back again, if only for a change of scenery, and give my taste buds a break from generous doses of MSG found in most Chinese restaurants. For its setting and service, I'd say.. Princess Garden of Mayfair is similarly priced as Royal China. In fact, service is better, and the decor is a lot more sophisticated.",

    "text": "A fairly good Chinese restaurant in Mayfair that offers a broad selection of generally high quality food. The choice and the style of dishes are very similar to Royal China's, with the traditional starters like smoked chicken, various rolls and dumplings and different seafood all there. The range of soups is pretty good too; as well as all the traditional mains like Peking duck, sea bass, curry and sweet & sour chicken, etc. Perhaps, the selection here is slightly wider than you would find in many similar places. Not much special though. The setting is modern with the stylish new interior, but contains some traditional elements like a big wooden eastern sculpture at the entrance. The dining hall is very spacious and there are large broad windows providing good views of the nearby Mayfair streets. The service is very respectful and attentive. This place is great for a good regular Chinese meal, but in some respects it doesn't measure up to top of the range restaurants such as Kai. The food is prepared to a high standard, but it isn't exceptional. The hot and sour soup, for instance tasted fairly standard. I expected a little more from a restaurant in such exclusive location. Fine overall, though. Definitely worth a visit.",

The Cantonese-speaking staff were just the right amount of attentive without being intrusive. And then there's the food. The soft-shell crab dish was absolutely delicious, as were the pea shoots (dao miu), the tiger prawns in garlic sauce and the dim sum sampler. The food would have been perfectly at home in any high end restaurant in Hong Kong. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Stopped by for dim sum on a rainy weekday afternoon. We were quite pleased with Mayfair Garden (note this is the name now). The ambiance is a bit nicer than most Chinese restaurants, though stops short of being high end or luxurious per se. Dining room is bright and comfortable, filled mostly with business lunches at the time. Smart casual attire did not seem to be required, though was not out of place. Service was generally perfunctory to slightly standoffish and awkward at times; perhaps the restaurant's biggest detractor.The food at Mayfair Garden is authentic and rather comparable to what one might get in China/HK - a pleasant surprise, and clearly the highlight. We enjoyed each dish and found the quality of cooking to be excellent. For the prices paid we were very satisfied. On this visit we tried:- Enoki & Beef Cheung Fun (\u00a35.00)- Char Sui Buns (\u00a34.00)- Baked Venison Puff (\u00a36.80)- Chinese Broccoli in Ginger Sauce (\u00a311.50)- Ho Fun with Beef in XO Sauce (\u00a311.50)My favourites in particular were the Char Sui Buns and Baked Venison Puffs, but really all of the items we selected were fresh and tasty. Recommend paying it a visit if in the Mayfair area and seeking solid Chinese cuisine, though don't expect the service or environment to blow you away.",

When I first read the menu, I knew this isn't some westernized dim sum restaurant made to fit the London culture, looked pretty authentic to me. The variety of dim sum is comparable to what I had back when I grew up in Hong Kong. The prices are reasonable, and the food was very well prepared and authentic despite the surprisingly well priced dim sum menu. Dishes are delicate and could tell that the ingredients are fresh. I would say it's a bit better than what you get in Chinatown, as it felt like everything you ordered was freshly made from the kitchen. Generally all the dishes we ordered were made better than expected, delicious!!! We were about to order peking duck, but was told that these orders need to be made 30 mins prior to dining, so do keep that in mind if you're wishing to order some peking duck.Was a little intimidated by the suits and ties dining there, (them boys DO know what they're ordering though!) \u00a0anyhow you could tell that their service lives up to their business diners, as the place seemed pretty clean. \u00a0 Oh, do make a booking as lunch time is pretty packed!

    "text": "It's probably the best dim sum I've had in London, which is saying a lot, since I find 99% of the Chinese restaurants in London to be entirely inedible (and this is coming from someone who's actually Chinese). Plus, I've been spoiled by the dim sum restaurants of the West Coast of the USA and Canada, where I grew up. So. Down to the nitty gritty: the surroundings are nice - not dim or dingy, but bright, clean and modern. Service is prompt and polite, regardless of whether we were conversing in English or Cantonese, which is always a plus. I was surprised by the \"Taiwan\"-style char siu buns, which were a hybrid of pineapple buns and char siu bao, but they were absolutely delicious. A little on the small size, but delicious. The cheung fun was fresh and tasty, as were the har gao and siu mai. The xiao long bao were a let down though; the wrapping was too thick and the lack of hot soup bursting in my mouth as I bit into the dumplings was a disappointment. All in all, very affordable prices for some dim sum that didn't taste like they'd just been defrosted and re-steamed.",

I'm not saying it is over priced but the food, whilst plentiful, is ok, some dishes were a bit salty, perhaps it is my taste buds...but there was 11 of us and several of us found this. We had a private room with two tables in it which could probably hold 12 people each. The service received was good although waiting staff seem unable to make a decision and they have to go and get a manager to deal with your request. the set menus offer a good variety of dishes and you really get plenty of food!!Even with the eleven of us we had left overs which they were more than happy to box up for us to take away at the end. Drinks variety is good and they have a range of alcoholic and non alcoholic cocktails. Once your food arrives if you have the duck they offer to wrap it for you!! I have never heard of this service before but we declined as making the wraps is part of the eating experience...well I think so! \u00a0The lobster was good althoughI'm not sure that it was enough for the six people it was meant to feed.so overall the food was ok plentiful not mind blowing but it hit the spot. The only irritant about the whole experience was when the bill came. Now we had booked a private room which we were charged for the privilege. The bill included a service charge of 15% but they had put the room charge in the bill which meant we were paying twice for the room. (Well not totally paying the full price for the room twice but you get what I mean) so a manager was summoned and a ten minute conversation was had and in fairness to him he took the cost of the room off the bill which appeased everyone.So would i eat here again...yeah I would it was an ok experience overall and the food was ok and plentiful.P.S. if you are driving up on a Saturday evening there are some spots with yellow lines around which you can park on after 6.30pm. Well I did and I did not get a ticket!!!",

The service was very good. It wasn't expensive at all, about \u00a314pp with 6 people, though I will caveat that by saying that I was nervous about ordering too much, given the fear of sticker shock when the bill came. The first hesitation I have if that everything came out very very quickly. Like, ready-made quickly, and correspondingly not as hot as I would like. However, the dim sum menu was really difficult. Everything's in English, with very nice descriptive names. As someone who orders dim sum frequently, it made it hard to identify what I wanted. There are no pictures. So I ended up mostly getting \"standards\", which was fine, but the things I tried to branch out with ended up all being the same, i.e. various steamed prawn dumplings. It was pretty nerve-wracking-- I felt like I didn't know how to order, and I was in charge of ordering for the group. So, I think I'd rather go to a place where I can know what I'm getting. For example, Dragon Castle does the balance of good service and an easy menu, though location is vastly different.",

I've had a lot of hits and misses with the restaurants in Chinatown, so I felt quite fortunate to find a place that actually tastes authentic. We had about 8 courses but the standouts were the crab fried rice and the sea bass, which was a big hit. You definitely won't go home hungry!",

    "text": "My favorite place to go for dim sum in London.Food is well executed, service is good, and the place is clean. I'd recommend making a reservation for weekends if you don't want to wait for a table (although not the worst place to have to wait for a table, since they have a full bar and lots of couches). No push-carts here, although I don't recall ever seeing push-carts in London. \u00a0Honestly though, I don't even like push-carts. I've been to yum cha enough times to know what I want on a menu, and things can go wrong with push-carts. First, it is more likely you're getting \"leftovers\" on a push-cart. Nope, I didn't want the ugly under-fried radish cake the first time I saw it come around on the cart, so why would I want it the fifth time? Second, I get irrationally upset when the push-cart ladies speak Mandarin instead of Cantonese, and don't understand when someone tries to order in Cantonese. I haven't had this problem in London, but it's a common occurrence in Canada nowadays.Anyways, everything I had here was well prepared. I particularly liked the cuttlefish cake tofu skin cheung fun and the XO beef chow hor fun. Generally, nothing too innovative in terms of dishes, but still my first choice when I'm craving yum cha.",
