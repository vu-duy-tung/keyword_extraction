It was pretty pricey though, with my tab being \u00a324. I didn't order that much, so not sure what went wrong there. They were very nice and helpful to us Americans. It would be a great place to socialize for sure.",

I really liked this place, I've been looking for yakiniku in London for years!I ordered the short rib kalbi, the spicy pork, and the spicy chicken. Spicy pork was my favorite, its fat dripping down the grill was the most beautiful sight I have seen in a while (I know, pork fat and beautiful usually don't go together). Also ordered the garlic chicken noodles which came on a hot plate and sizzled into the crispness I prefer as I let it sit. The mushroom in butter was simple but delicious and I loved the soondobu!",

    "text": "YES! YES! YES!!! Or perhaps I should say HAI! HAI! HAI!!!!I was feverishly looking for a Japanese place that served more typical japanese things and not just sushi and after exhausting the first 100 results that came up on my Yelp mobile app, I came across Kintan and to my surprise, this place was Meccha Umakatta!!! (Super Delish!!!) It's a Yakiniku joint and if you've never been to one, you basically order a bunch of different types of marinated meat and you grill it yourself in front of you; very similar to the Korean BBQ places. In addition to the meat party, you get a whole bunch of sides like karaage (my fave), takoyaki, hiyashidofu and gyoza. Don't know how to select??? No problem!! They also have set menus!!! But if you are already familiar with Yakiniku or you are with Japanese, they can help you out :) My recommendations for this place??? You got it!!1. Kalbi (actually this should always be ordered no matter where you are!!)2. Garlic Harami3. Beef Tongue (eaten with salt and lemon)4. Karaage6. Spicy Cucumber7. Sukiyaki Bibimbab (of course WITH spice!)Of course all of this can be downed with a bottle of Kirin Ichiban!!Now... let's talk prices... I didn't know this until we got there, but we were there for Happy Hour and let me tell you know, this time is VERY happy!!! It's not just a few select items, but most of the menu is up to half off!!! I couldn't believe it and I will only go here for Happy Hour since it's almost every day with Monday's being all day Happy Hour!! Does it get more happy than that!?!!\u30ed\u30f3\u30c9\u30f3\u3067\u306f\u548c\u98df\u5c4b\u3055\u3093\u304c\u591a\u304f\u3066\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b\u306e\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u304f\u306a\u3044\u3051\u3069\u8a33\u308f\u304b\u3089\u306a\u3044\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30fb\u30ec\u30a4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30fb\u30a2\u30dc\u30ab\u30c9\u30fb\u30de\u30f3\u30b4\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb\u307f\u305f\u3044\u306a\u5909\u306a\u5bff\u53f8\u5c4b\u3055\u3093\u3070\u3063\u304b\u308a\u306a\u3093\u3060\u304b\u3089\u305f\u307e\u306b\u306f\u666e\u901a\u306e\u5c45\u9152\u5c4b\u3068\u304b\u713c\u8089\u306e\u6240\u306b\u884c\u304d\u305f\u304f\u3066\u3053\u306e\u30ad\u30f3\u30bf\u30f3\u3063\u3066\u3044\u3046\u713c\u8089\u5c4b\u3055\u3093\u3092\u767a\u898b\u3057\u307e\u3057\u305f\uff01\uff01\u30cf\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30a2\u30ef\u30fc\u304c\u3042\u308b\u306e\u3067\u305d\u306e\u6642\u306b\u884c\u3051\u3070\u5024\u6bb5\u306f\u305d\u3093\u306a\u9ad8\u304f\u306f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u3059\u3002\u4f8b\u3048\u3070\u751f\u30d3\u30fc\u30eb\u00a3\uff13\u3001\u30ab\u30eb\u30d3\u00a3\uff14\u3001\u713c\u304d\u3057\u3083\u3076\u30d3\u30fc\u30d5\u00a3\uff13\u3002\u8089\u8cea\u304c\u826f\u304f\u3066\u30bf\u30ec\u3082\u7f8e\u5473\u3057\u304f\u3066\u713c\u8089\u3092\u6b32\u3057\u3044\u3068\u601d\u3063\u305f\u3089\u662f\u975e\u3053\u3053\u306b\u307e\u305f\u6765\u307e\u3059\uff01\u3002\u3002\u3002\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093\u30cf\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc\u30a2\u30ef\u30fc\u306e\u6642\u306b\u306d\uff01",

The benefit being that you get a bunch of signature dishes and it works out cheaper than ordering them separately from the a la carte.Our starters of Edamame, Miso Soup, Kintan Salad, brilliantly named Tuna Tartar Volcano and Garlic Fried Noodles all came first and all underwhelmed with the exception of the salad, which had a lovely soy, mustard, miso dressing. The noodles were very bland and uninspiring with hardly any veg or meat and the tuna tartar was served on a dense block of fried rice that tasted like a savoury doughnut. Off to a bad start.Then came the meat. Lots of meat.The Fillet Mignon, marinated in Yuzu Ponzu and the Garlic Tiger Prawns were first to hit the grill. Our very friendly waitress from New York advised on cooking times, which were all very safe. We ignored them and cooked by eye. Next came plates of thinly sliced and beautifully marinated Premium Kalbi Short Rib with Tare sweet Soy, Harami Skirt Steak with Miso and (bizarrely) two chunky slabs of Halloumi.",

The electronic music which was played in the background didn't help us to relax either. So basically we paid around \u00a3100 for bad service, bad atmosphere and a bad experience...

We went for the meaty one and omg...as expected...so much meat. the sweetcorn with butter and lettuce salad were the only veggies we got and both was yummy but I have to say the desserts and some members of staff were a let down. I ordered drinks repeatedly and they never arrived and the waitress didn't explain the desserts properly hence we ended up with 8 smores instead of smores for 4 people. When we tried to explain. She just said rudely said kitchen closed. No change. Go for the food and don't expect too much in terms of service and you'll enjoy it.",

We studied the menus thoroughly and we all decided to order different things. The lunch time offer is a bargain! Then they starTed the bbq in the middle of our table :) and we started cooking! The seafood and meats were fresh and of decent quality. We all enjoyed our food very much and the waitress came several times to check on us, topping up our drinks and asking if everything was ok. We had a lovely lunch and enjoyed the Japanese decorations and ambiance.",

There was different cuts of beef, chicken and some pork and prawns, sweet marinated for you to cook over a hot grill.I liked it, however thought it could do with more selection of sauces, and some beef chunks were slightly too big and chewy to take it in one mouth full. The sides like the garlic rice, and the starters was good and offset some of the sweeter bbq dishes, great with a cold pint of beer. Confused with the French fries, but that was woofed down just the same.The dessert was different, kind of heavy still, I would have preferred fruit or something acidic.  The venue is much larger than it seems from the outside. And vented really well, so it should be for indoor BBQ. Staff was kind and helpful, showed us what to do and patient with our requests. Quite efficient operation they have. Tip: ask for your grill to be changed once it starts getting charred, or your meats will start to taste burnt.",

You cook the dishes as you wish to enjoy them and that's pretty much it. It's very easy and quality of the meats is top notch.The interior is lovely and homely. Sadly the same couldn't be said about the bathrooms. Considering how good the restaurant itself is, the mens toilets were dreadful. Tiny and poorly maintained.Staff were quite good. However as the restaurant got busier, it took longer to get the staff's attention. Requests for water were forgotten. Luckily however they didn't forget any of the food.For those worrying about leaving hungry, you'll eat plenty. No worries about that.",

Despite the bar area being standing only, I highly recommend eating at the bar. It offers an amazing all day every day happy hour deal. Half off asahi on draft, hot and cold sake. 50% off a large selection of apps, rice, noodle and dessert dishes off the regular menu. Super nice bartender. Eat at the bar!Spicy tofu - Cold tofu dish with a single slab of tofu topped with a sweet red chili sauce and crunch. I don't know what that crunch is. All I know is that I was basically licking the bowl clean of the crunch that had fallen off the tofu. I'm not a huge tofu fan but I highly recommend this dish. Steamed chili gyoza - 5 pieces on a platter. Similar sauce to the spicy tofu dish, but without the crunch.Sukiyaki bibimbap - Comes in a piping hot dish that continues to sizzle and cook as you eat it. Don't touch that bowl, I know from experience :( Wait staff execute a tableside preparation of mixing the egg into the rice.",

It can be a bit pricey - \u00a0starts at \u00a370 for two for the specials, but it is a lot of food. You can also order ala carte. The taste and quality is very good. You know it's authentic because Japanese people are eating here! Did not give 5 stars because price is a bit too high.",

Yes, indeed.Good points:-The meats are marinated in an excellent manner ensuring that you will have finger licking good food.Service isn't too bad considering we were politely told the next group booking is waiting, and we were allowed to eat our birthday cake.Big menu list allowing you to order even the randomest meats, like ox tongue, tail or something or another. If you want some Korean bibimbap? They have it. You want smores for dessert? They have it too.Bad points:-Food is overloaded with MSG, so make sure you either buy a lot of alcohol or prepare to drink a lot of water.It's quite pricey if you want to gorge yourself on meat. For my group of 10 we paid \u00a352 per person including service charge, although yes we ordered a few sake, plum wine, and wagyu beef.They do not really advertise their deals enough. I think I saw in the toilets that Tuesdays are student nights and Wednesdays are ladies nights. Then there are the happy hours on certain days when you get half price drinks.I really liked wagyu beef and the spicy kalbi pork. If you order lamb it only comes in two pieces. The mushrooms are not worth ordering (unless you really like them?). The precooked noodles are really good.Closest station is Chancery Lane, or Holborn. Booking is allowed. Not bad if you want some Japanese BBQ action. Yes you cook it yourself, but they do come and change the grill to a clean one at least once during your 2 hour stay.",

My favourite of all - Beef tongue (Dont pull that face now). Super yammy and it does not taste like tongue at all - It taste like chicken :P Naaaah just pulling your leg. But it is really one of the best dishes and you will for sure enjoy it.Additional to all the great meats you can also get veggies and fish which you can also grill. Added to all the grilling are some Japanese transitional dishes which are very well prepared.Top all of the with an extensive drink menu and all those happy hour deals and i am sure you will enjoy the place as much as we do.",
