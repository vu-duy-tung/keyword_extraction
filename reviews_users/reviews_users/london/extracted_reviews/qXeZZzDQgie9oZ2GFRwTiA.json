This is the second restaurant opened by Eco - the other in Clapham and it is a very much welcomed addition to the food scene in Chiswick.A modern and contemporary feel to this place that is dominated by the open plan kitchen and smart bar, the pizza's and pasta's and other Italian dishes are simply stunning and with the chef's tossing the pizza's it makes for an experience rather than a meal. \u00a0An excellent and varied menu to suit everyone (try the frogs leg's pizza) with excellent service, great atmosphere and wonderful food.",

Even better. Quick pizza before hitting the bars? You bet.The menu is wide and varied and they even do some mean looking non-pizza options. The man in me has never been able to stray from the pizza though, it's just so good. Not too doughy, toppings delicious and get this; a female friend went far enough (maybe a little deluded) to pronounce Eco pizza as 'vaguely healthy'! Make your own mind up...Oh and....Eco takeaway plus The Manor Arms (see review) could well be my favourite Sunday afternoon combos... like, ever. Give them a ring, reel off the memorised menu and go collect in 15 mins \u00a0- the walk round the corner and back being just enough time for the rest of the team to get the next round in. Bloody brilliant. Well played Clapham.",

After the main course a dessert/drinks menu was brought to my table which I happily ordered both a dessert and a rum and coke from from. When the bill came the total was about \u00a35 more than I had expected. When I queried this with the waitress who was actually fairly polite, another member of staff came up to me and said the menu prices were wrong! When I then asked to speak to the manager he was exceedingly rude and told me it was essentially my mistake: \"You cannot expect to pay those prices for what you have just had.\" So presumably an incorrect menu is the customers' fault?! After a brief argument about it (a first in a restaurant for me!) he grudgingly agreed to let me have the food and drink for the price it had been on the menu. I was appalled and needless to say will not be going back! It would have been a one star rating but the food was ok so I am giving it two!",

For a neighbourhood restaurant that manage to last such a long time can only mean one thing, it has a loyal local following and the cooking is value for money. \u00a0I love a good old fashioned Italian meal and the menu at Eco looks really tempting, from a selection of classic antipasti to pizza and pasta, just how real Italian food should be. The sourdough bread here really stood out, it had a really impressive lovely soft texture.The chilli prawn starter is a must try for any seafood and spicy food lovers, the powerful chilli and tomato flavours on the plate really brought out the sweetness of the prawn. The avocado and rocket bruschetta is also another solid antipasti dish, the buttery and peppery flavours worked like a treat on a piece of finely grilled bread, not to mention the quality of the olive oil was outstanding. The prawn and salmon spaghetti had a wonderful creamy texture, silky smooth and cooked to the perfect level. My favourite dish on the dish has to be one of the special menu on the night: The San Daniele risotto. The earthiness of the wild mushroom worked wonder with the sweet and nutty profile of the much celebrated ham, on top of that, it had the freshness and crispness of the asparagus offer a lovely contrast to the richness of the parmesan, it was really an enjoyable risotto. Less impressive was the stonebass, the seasoning was lacking and the garnishes of caper and olives were a touch too strong which overpowered the fish. Beside that, overall Eco has done a fine job in dishing out some very quality classic Italian cooking, nothing fancy or creative, just proper Italian food at a super reasonable price with bags of flavours. There are still plenty of the dishes on the menu I would love to try so I will definitely make a return when I am near Clapham again in the future.",

The base of all of their pizzas are sour dough too and as a result the pizzas are pretty damn delicious. I'd recommend anything with artichoke (mmm four seasons) as they are particularly good here. But all delicious. Pizzas are around \u00a38/9 and are super filling. The wine list is well priced, I don't remember too much over \u00a320. The 'by the glass' isn't going to knock your socks off but with prices that cheap for a bottle, go on, get a bottle. It's more fun that way. The wine is served in tumblers. Argh. But fair enough, it's that type of wine. The other food like charcuterie, dips, antipasto are down to earth and refined rustic I guess. I'm always a sucker for a starter but don't go crazy or you will need to be rolled out of the joint as once you start eating that bread you will not be able to stop. They also do breakfast. Another chance to have the bread. My pick is the veg breakfast with everything (or I think I got vegan with eggs). The tomatoes are slow cooked and there is avocado. Haven't tried anything else breakfast-y but it reads well. Anyway, nice Italian, probably could cut out half of the menu and just have a bit more focus on pizza with a couple of extras. The steak with hollandaise for brunch seems a little unnecessary... Stick to pizza and antipasto-ish bits!",

That sour bread really has to be tasted to be believed. I have never had sour bread like it. It looked so unassuming, almost like the kind of rustic scones my granny in Ireland used to make. But it did not taste like a rustic scone, no Siree! I'm not over-exagerrating when I say it was like a flavour explosion inside my mouth. It almost felt like eating a fizzy drink, if that makes sense. It blew my mind and was beyond delicious.The drink (which there was copious amounts of, coupled with staff regularly going round topping up our glasses) consisted of red and white wine. I opted for the red. It tasted top quality.The service was great. Smiley faces all round ; the staff were super accomodating! They really did everything they could to ensure we all had a great night.The venue itself was lovely. Comforting wooden tables and elegant, understated Christmas decorations. I have enclosed some photos so do be sure to check them out.I will definetly be returning to Eco!",

Had to wait ages for a table which isn't itself a problem, but when a group arrived after us and is seated first, I'm generally annoyed!! Host was mistaken, and apologised and sent over some prosecco as an apology which was a nice touch. When we were seated we promptly ordered a few items to share: arancini and bruschetta to start, and roasted aubergine pizza, ham pizza and spaghetti and meatballs. Arancini were dry and overcooked, and crying out for salt (or flavour of any kind). Bruschetta was mostly bland bread with small bit of yet again under seasoned toppings. The pizzas were without flavour, the crust was chewy and bland. Even the garlic and chilli oil on the table couldn't really rescue them! The toppings were so overcooked and mushy! And the meatballs...they were small (not in itself an issue!) and rock hard! Basically inedible. Pasta was lukewarm and in a sad sea of flavourless red sauce. This place clearly caters to birthday groups as there were at least 5 large parties there, making for a rather loud and annoying atmosphere! With the many options available in Clapham, this place has dropped to the bottom of the list!",

They put the 2 cover tables so close together that the people sitting beside you have to move their table for you to get in. Hopefully you don't need to go to the bathroom during your meal. They were very busy, but you expect that on a Sunday. Well it took over 10mins for someone to take our order, and they managed to mess up a black coffee for a white one, no biggie, i sent it back, and they immediately bought one back. During the next 40 mins I watched as the kitchen became so inundated with orders that they weren't even pulling them off the printer. There were at least 10 orders not even looked at by the kitchen staff. Downside to having an open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant, everyone can see how backed up the orders are. I was watching as what I can only guess were the owners running around demanding wait staff move faster, the head chef was freaking out because the kitchen couldn't cope, they turned customers away as the kitchen was now not taking new orders. The ladies 2 tables down were checking on their order as it had been 45mins since they ordered. Finally they got their meals, and one was cold, so she sent it back. At some stage an order had slid off the pass and onto the floor. My housemate picked it up, thankfully it wasn't our order, but the chefs didn't even know it was missing.....Finally our food came. I love food. I love breakfast. I like taking pics of the food i get presented at restaurants and posting it to social media. After the 45mins waiting to be presented with measly looking poached eggs, dry sourdough, \u00a0stewed bacon, overcooked tomatoes, and watery mushrooms, I was extremely disapointed.Needless to say I will never go back, and I'll probably just stick to my local Brixton area for future brunches.",

    "text": "Definitely the best option for pizza on Clapham High Street - much better than nearby (chain) Strada. It's my local pizza place, so I've been here many times for a quick lunch or a social dinner. I've tried most of the pizzas and pastas on the menu and they always hit the mark. The wine list is succinct and not particularly interesting, but most of the choices are pleasant and a nice accompaniment to the meal. It's four stars, not three, because 1. the staff are wonderful - always friendly and on the ball 2. the quality is consistent and 3. seems like fresh ingredients and handcrafted dishes, doesn't feel like the frozen pre-packed stuff you get at chain restaurants. Four stars, not five, because while it's very good, it doesn't blow my mind. Still, excellent choice for a meal in Clapham.",

I would suggest asking for the steak being more underdone than you would like. They have a good range of drinks and I recommend the Bellini. This place is great for large groups too.",

Starters range from bread, something fried or antipasto (my personal favourite)Main courses include steak, something Italian or a good salad.By then I've eaten too much to try the deserts unfortunately. Give everything a go here if you are local to the area. Good food, good service at a great price. Glad to have this close by!",

Such a shame given how good the food and general ambience actually was.",

To be honest that is a pretty good compliment as I know I will, at the very least, be getting good Italian food that is freshly prepared along with good service. Its not a life changing experience but definately worth a visit if you're in the area. Would recommend.",

    "text": "We ordered 4 dips and bread for a sharing starter. The hot dips were burnt which was shame as the sausage and chorizo dip seemed promising.The asparagus and pancetta salad was also a little disappointing. The salad was stingy with only two spears of asparagus. The aubergine and burrata pizza was poor. Sadly it was spoiled by the aubergine which was far too wet and made most of the base of the pizza soggy.For dessert, I chose the orange and almond tart. This was tasty, but presented horribly. It looked like someone had shaken ketchup all over it (I know it was coulis). I really think they could have made more of an effort!",

    "text": "I really like this place. It's charming; the hosts are very nice an accommodating when you enter. I've never seen them turn anyone away even with a large group. The pizzas are fantastic and I recommend any of the pastas on the menu. Everything seems quite fresh and the setting is nice. Service is usually really good but with some delays if they're very busy. My only detraction about the place is this and owners if you read this please know I'm not the only diner who thinks this... please get some REAL wine glasses. No one enjoys wine out of a water glass. I brought a large group of \u00a0people to this place recently and they all looked at the 'wine' glass in disbelief. Perhaps I'm a traditionalist in the sense that I think wine belongs in a stemmed glass. So far both groups of people I've taken here have the same complaint, give me a real wine glass. In addition this also creates confusion when the server wants to refill your water and accidentally pours it into your empty red wine glass (because they look the same) thus giving you water with just a hint of pink. Festive yes, ideal no. I recommend this place and return often. This American Southerner in London would be stoked to return to find a stem on his wine glass while enjoying your fabulous pizzas and pastas. So I ask again, please y'all just give us some real wine glasses. Grazzi!",

    "text": "Sorry Eco - this past weekend you lost yourself a very loyal customer. I shall list the ways you erred, in an effort to make sure you up your game because I'd dearly love to come back, but it just wasn't good enough:One of your waitresses is chewing gum, which is kind of gross. She was rude, grumpy and did not make us feel welcome. The same waitress then actually ignored a request for our undercooked and inadequate eggs (uncooked egg white with no yolk? yes, that does warrant a replacement) to be taken away. She didn't just 'not hear' us, she looked at us, scowled and walked away. As I said, the eggs weren't done properly. And don't think we haven't noticed you've significantly reduced your portion sizes while keeping your prices the same. And finally, the piece de resistance - when my card didn't work the first time, instead of (correct me if I'm wrong but you are legally obliged to do this) providing me with the void slip to prove the transaction hadn't gone through, your waiter shouted at me. He failed to understand why it was quite important I see the void slip, and took it extremely personally that I wouldn't re-enter my pin. Thankfully someone else - your only nice staff member, it would seem - stepped in and did some re-printing. But guess what? Today my credit card statement arrived and you DID charge me twice. So, I will not be frequenting your restaurant for brunch again, however good your (shrinking) bread is. I did not enjoy the experience even one little bit.",
