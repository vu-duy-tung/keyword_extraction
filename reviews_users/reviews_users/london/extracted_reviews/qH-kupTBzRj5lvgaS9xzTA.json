Would definitely recommend as mentioned in previous comments it is light and airy with excellent service. upstairs is better than downstairs in my opinion. Free wifi available, and it says something about the clientele that I've only ever seen Macs in there! Relatively pricey though hence 4 stars.",

I ordered an organic herbal infusion of red fruits, that came in a teapot, sufficient for two very generous cups. It was great with the demerara sugar lumps. Even the bathroom is nice! They had Aveda hand soap and moisturising milk, scented with rosemary and mint. I will definitely be going back to try the organic food, that looked delicious.",

The restaurant has a beautiful space on the upper floor which the staff closed off for our private event and decorated beautifully with flowers and candles. The food was wonderful, the staff attentive and they made the most wonderful birthday cake (we are speaking to them about doing a wedding cake too!). It would be perfect for a corporate cocktail party or a drinks and canapes wedding reception. I'm not exactly sure how many people they can fit but we had 70 people for my birthday and we were very comfortable. I cannot recommend the place highly enough!",

Tasty breakfasts (I highly recommend the porridge with bananas, berries and nuts), aforementioned bowled coffee/tea and great sandos to go make Le Pain a delightful any-time stop in my book.",

And it is to perfect to eat only little. The name of this restaurant will be a tounge twister for me, for ever and yet i will remember it very positiv. It is remarkably less noise in here, no loud music, the service is much more attentiv and friendly and there are many real windows that let the daylight in. On top of that it is all very tidy, even the toilets are very nice decorated and tidy. All things that, we learned the days before, cant be taken for granted in good old London. My fresh made, warm porridge tasted so good! Ok, i took the wonderful strawberry-marmelade on it, too. The egg with bread was also perfect. The absolute highlight was the fresh and warm scone, served with cream!No comparison to all other scones i was used to. At home i use organic flour and i know that this give this great taste. We took this perfect strawberry-marmelade on the cream on the scone and were floating in the 7. sky of breakfast!",

This particular spot is one of the larger Le Pains, which is just as well given that we visited on a rainy, school holiday lunch time on our way to the nearby museums. The service was friendly and efficient, the tomato tart wasn't quite what I was expecting (I was thinking quiche, not tomato on puff pastry) but was tasty and quickly devoured by myself and my toddler.Reasonably kid friendly, you can always fall back on fruit or their excellent bread if your little one is having a particularly picky day, though there is plenty on the menu that should tempt them.Great place to go in the mid morning or afternoon to just sit, drink tea (and scoff rhubarb crumble) and read a book...",

Seemed to be unnecessarily frazzled considering it wasn't very busy, and lacked a bit of common sense. Took a while to get attention for the bill and also to pay. Shame really.",

Staff was oblivious, messed up 3 things in my order, rude, and when the food finally came it was BAD. This place has potential if everyone was retrained, front and back of the house. Really really really terrible. This place actually inspired me to make a yelp account to wright this review. At least now I can give good reviews to places that deserve it. Just one more time for the road.....TERRIBLE Maybe they're take away service for coffee js passable. -_-",

This place is simply awful! \u00a0Service was simply substandard. \u00a0The waiter was absolutely rude, short with any of us who placed orders at our table and very offensive. \u00a0One of the guests didn't like the ice tea he got, and he wanted it changed with another drink after the first couple of sips. \u00a0The waiter got visibly irritated and angry throwing silver wear on our table and even aggressive and rude words. \u00a0I had ordered ice tea by chance also. \u00a0When I took a sip of the drink I almost threw up. It was the worst ice tea I had ever tasted. \u00a0Another waiter came by after that and she was also super rude, and short all during our dinner. \u00a0I asked the drink to be changed with water and I got lectured by the second waiter. \u00a0The first waiter even acted like he wanted to get physical with one of our family members. \u00a0Needless to say the experience was horrible. \u00a0We decided to leave right as we saw the behavior develop, but we had an elderly person with us who had to eat right away due to medical reasons. So we stayed and endured the rude treatment of our group and the way another couple were treated in this over priced restaurant. \u00a0Stay away from this place as you will be paying a lot of money for a very average food, and get treated horribly by a very rude group of employees.",

I don't know...the food is just different (definitely more bland and a little meh). But, the general menu is the same and I like the vegan options. If in London, I'd recommend the Notting Hill Gate location over others.",

It honestly had me dreaming of it for months. I came back to London this week for a trip with my sister. I had the same thing again! It was just as delicious and filling. It's the perfect way to start your day. My sister got the Belgium waffle with the chocolate sauce on the side. She said it was one of the best waffles she's ever had in her life. It was like a dense donut that was rich and savory. It was small and she was nervous is wouldn't be enough but it was the perfect size. I got an Americano and she got a lemonade which was tart but deliciously homemade. Highly recommend for a night brunch before a flight out!",
