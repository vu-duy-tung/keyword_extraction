There menu says to let them know if you have an allergy and when I told them they got extremely upset and told me that I can't eat anything here as everything is cooked in peanut oil. You think this would be something they say up front outside their restaurant or on the menu. What the point of telling them you have a nut allergy if you can't even eat anything there? This restaurant was a waste of my time.",

    "text": "Very popular already and rightly so. This small, utilitarian Sichuan/Szechwan cafe over 2 or 3 floors serves up spicy and pungent dishes from Chengdu that can be budget-busting cheap as long as you've got cash in your wallet (they don't take cards). Don't expect comfy seats or generous tables, and do expect to be surrounded by Chinese students and fighting for elbow room.We hit the 30 pounds mark with a dinner for two of two ice teas (meh), one boiled rice, fried green beanstalks with crispy stuff (yum), a slow-cook stew of beef and knotted tofu (delicious) and a gargantuan bowl of chilli-oil, chilli and sichuan pepper cooked catfish which arrive looking like a potential torture device from a James Bond move...So Mr Bond... you think your face can survive being immersed in the hot oil bath of 300 chillis and 200 peppercorns...? Mwa hahaha hahaWhile not good for the wasteline, the fiery oily catfish was music to my tongue and lips. Tingling the nerve ends on entry and warming my cockles after each bite. A steal at the current promotion price of 7 quid for the bowl. The beef and tofu dish was even better, with tingles of peppercorns and a juicy salty gravy.While we loved the food and wished we could've explored much more of this exotic menu, we did leave parched from the quite stupendous spicy saltiness of sichuan food. Staring at another table's cucumber salad had me practically swooning as I left in an emergency hunt for milk tea, frozen yoghurt and iced lime cordial.",

    "text": "A huge vote of thanks to Rachel Z for organising a meal at this little gem of restaurant. Easy to miss on the edge of Chinatown, they have made the best of the small floor acreage spread over several floors. They were very helpful in re-arranging tables for our group of 6I must also give praise to the staff for their friendliness and helpfulness in helping guests unfamiliar with Sichuan food. They do speak good English to help navigate the menu. Their menus also deserve praise - large, well bound red tomes (in keeping with the decor but more about this in a moment) containing lovely pictures and descriptions of all their dishes. I love the quirky sense of humour in the restaurant with communist party propaganda posters adorning the walls taking me back to my trip to ShanghaiFortunately, we had a bona-fide connoisseur in Rachel Z and we just sat back and let her order. And she ordered up a veritable feast, which came to a very reasonable \u00a320 a head - note that it's a cash only establishmentThe star of the show was the mao cei hotpot, one of their signature dishes. You select different ingredients to go into a fiery stew, which arrives dramatically in a huge claypot. Being Sichuan food, it's fiery hot from the many chillis that you can see but it's also the little peppercorns, which burst in your mouth and numb your tongue. I do however want to emphasise that the food is also packed with flavour as well as heat. This was our favourite dish of the eveningThis was a truly exhilarating meal. I had the funniest feeling when my mouth was fine eating the fiery food - I think the peppercorns had numbed my tongue enough that I could do so but obviously, my body was feeling the heat even if my mouth couldn't because sweat was pouring off my forehead, prompting Krista A to offer me a tissue! There was a whole wave of exhilaration among the group and later, we decided it could have been an endorphin rush in response to the heat! Not only did our stomachs feel sated but our pores also felt cleansed!Other dishes included catfish in hot chilli oil (soft and moorish), slow cooked pork belly (mmmm), green beans, fried greens in garlic and a mixed meat dishThis is what Chinese food in London in 2013 is all about. After decades of Cantonese classics, we're now in the brave new world of Sichuan, Hunan, Taiwan and Dongbei food. If they serve food as good as Baiwei, long may the revolution continue!!",

Not here.Solid start with chili oil pork ears, which erred on the side of pickle sweet of northern tradition; black pepper beef tripe was served cold and tender, pairing up real nice with their impossibly fluffy white rice.Szechuan beef brisket and bamboo stew arrived in a quaint little wooden bucket. Super flavorful, a sure favorite for those looking for a heavy flavor profile. Lunch wrapped up with the fried spicy pork knuckles: crispy skin and soft insides, all good things.Your order will arrive quickly, in my case all four in 5 minutes. That at least one waiter is dedicated to each dining floor makes calling one so much easier - a rarity in this part of town.Fair warning - only cash is accepted.",

Considering the size of some of the sharing dishes particularly the soups. The flavours were great in some dishes, but the peppercorns that were in literally everything had a numbing effect on the tongue that almost felt like it was compensating for the heat of the meal. Thus the food didn't appear to taste that hot personally to me. My favourites were the braised pork belly. So tender. Followed by the Pork hotpot with onions, peppers and LOTS of peppercorn. Whilst the food was hot, everything was packed with flavour. The heat didn't overpower the flavours of the dishes which is a real positive. We all know that feeling where food is so hot nothing can satiate the fire. Not milk, or running your tongue under a cold tap. With the side affect being you can't taste the flavours of any food afterward. Food never reaches that point and as a result you can enjoy spicy dish after spicy dish with no issues.Service was nice and friendly. The only downside being the place doesn't take bookings and is cash only. But given the generous portions and free internal wamth during the winter months, who can really complain. It's difficult to squeeze groups into the small location too, so keep parties below 6 and preferable 2-4 and you'll be fine.",

Oooh, I do love you Baiwei!!Avoiding the hotpot for now (but I'll get back for it, granted!), we took a wide selection of dish, 6 for 3 people. Be prepared, you won't know most of the dishes, but just indulge on the pictures, then close the menu and open it n times, then point your finger to a dish and order it! You'll surely get something delicious in front of you!But beware, did I already say this is AUTHENTIC cuisine? That means you'll get two things in your food: garlic and peppers. Your food will be damn covered by it, as it is in a usual restaurant in the Middle Earth (Zhongguo)! And another notice, in comparison with the dishes you usually get in the european-washed chinese restaurant you are used to, dishes are much bigger, 2 per person may even be too much!Aaah Baiwei, you brought me tons of memories to my eyes, and at the end I don't know whether I was crying more from remembering the awesome time in China or the peppers!",

Sure, the dishes are full of chili oil, peppers, peppercorns, but I only took two gulps of water the entire meal. So, this is definitely catering to the British crowd (I must admit I was raised in Shanghai & Southern California and an absolute lover of spicy food). I also thought other flavors just werent strong enough. Overall, everything was 'A-OK' - thus the 3-star.Me and my boyfriend were lucky enough to have the ground floor window seats, which is probably the best spot in the house. The table & benches are in the more traditional style where the table is much higher than the current norm.The CPC propaganda theme is a lil silly and gimmicky. It was estimated that Sichuan province had the highest cases of death from starvation during Great Leap Forward's famine...not sure how the posters are supposed to make me feel while eating all the food? Nevertheless, still better decor than the typical environment with woodwork, lanterns, awful paintings, and mirrors.",

    "text": "After a bit of a disaster and having to walk out of a restaurant we had reservations at earlier in the evening, we were hungry and needed something good. So Andrew M. suggested we go to Baiwei after hearing Yee Gan's recommendation of the place. We all love Chinese (and I'm all about the spice), so it was a big hit for everyone.So we arrive, and we are told several times \"cash only\". It's a bit strange, although given how we like to use cards pretty much everywhere now, I suppose they need to make sure that people have the necessary cash to pay for the meal. We waited a bit to find out if they had a table for five, and they told us to go upstairs. Luckily, they had a great table for us, next to the window, and also a table where someone didn't have to sit in someone else's lap. So that was a good start. The menu looked pretty extensive as well with lots of choices available. We opted for a couple of appetizers and quite a few mains (we may have over-ordered), but the whole bill came to \u00a329pp so it worked out well for us all.To start we had some sort of chicken dish and a tripe dish. The chicken was good, but not amazing, and weirdly had a lot of cartilage left in the meat. The tripe was fantastic though. I couldn't get enough. Not too chewy, lots of flavor and I was really impressed. For the mains, we ordered a selection, including a bucket of beef, and almost everything we had was delicious (and spicy). I was in heaven. The cumin lamb was probably my favorite with a nice cumin-y crust on the lamb and some delicious green chiles served with it. We also got some beef shin, and it was nice, but a little bit fatty and gelatinous, and one piece I bit into was pretty much only cartilage.But I'd come back. It was some of the tastiest Chinese food I've had in London, even if we didn't go too crazy with the selection of offal available. But no complaints at all. Even with it being cash only. I'm kind of craving that lamb right now....",

    "text": "I've been to Baiwei four times now, and each time has been better than the last. The first time we went, despite the place being nearly empty, we were offered a seat right by the toilets. Not nice. The waitress was quite rude when we asked for a different table, too.But that seems to have been a one-off, and I'm pleased to say that since then, we've had brusque but efficient service, great food, and normal seating. Regarding seating, this place is crammed full. If your posterior is average or a little larger than average or you're particularly tall, you may have a difficult time getting comfortable when it's full--and it's almost always full.Cash only, as everyone has commented--and as the staff will remind you about three times. ;) But there's a cash point right down the street.The important part is, of course, food! This is really nice, really homey Sichuanese. It's not prettied up, it's not fussy, and it's all been delicious. We've munched our way through about 1/3 of the menu so far. Our favourite dish by far--we get it every time--is the golden coin beef tripe. It's a cold, spicy tripe dish and it's absolutely perfect, with numbing peppers throughout. The spicy dishes tend to be along the dry wok-fried end (and hot pots, we haven't tried one yet) while the mild dishes are more the goopy-sauce fare. We haven't liked them as much, though if you're scared of fire, the gong bao chicken is pretty tame and can be made without peppers. (But try them, they're delicious.)Mains are, I think, a little overpriced for the area and the d\u00e9cor (crammed in diner-style, basement if you're down there, knocking elbows and knees with neighbours). Appetisers are absolutely overpriced for tiny portions, so lean towards the mains.They don't take reservations and evenings get very full, but they do tend to have a brisk turnover. Aim for an early or late dinner and you should be ok.",

I always end up stopping at this little gem multiple times whenever I'm in \u00a0London. \u00a0Little tip, if you want an even more authentic culinary experience, ask for extra spicy and extra Sichuan peppercorns. I've seen them tone it down a little and it's much better with those extra peppercorns. My only complaint is that they're occasionally inconsistent. Sometimes the hot pot is mind-blowing (intensely fragrant and complex), other times just good, but not exactly at the same level. \u00a0Still, I cannot recommend this place enough (specifically for the hot pot as that's the only thing I ever get there). Don't expect this place to have super smiley table service. Respect that there's a cultural difference. I didn't perceive the service to be rude at all, just Asian! (I'm Asian, I'm allowed to say that). Not all the servers speak perfect English. So...this ain't like brunch at a vegan cafe in LA, you know what I mean? There's a vast difference between rude and just neutral, functional and quick.",

In some cases it's possible, in others not. I was intersted to see how this place compared to the Chinese restaurants I've been to in China. That's really broad I know, but whatever. I remember there being a lot more vegetable options, but here there didn't seem to be as many. We ordered the Tofu Slivers as an appetizer which was actually one of my favorite dishes. They're essentially tofu noodles served cold and with a subtle brown warm sauce with chillis. It was really addicting and delicious. The hot and sour soup was very strange. Almost too strong of a brown sauce flavor. A little too much for me. The gong bao prawns with peanuts had a very strong ginger flavor which was nice. And the pock-marked old woman's tofu with pork (we got it without pork, which was a nice option) was a bit of a disappointment. It had 2 chilis on the menu so I thought it would be too spicy for me, but it wasn't really spicy at all. It also had a lot of oil and not much flavor unfortunately. The service was also very... cold, which could be part of the culture. Just be aware that they won't smile and if you want something you need to ask for it, they won't check on you. The restaurant seating on the ground floor is very small... and it's CASH ONLY!",

    "text": "Baiwei gives you a little food journey to the northern areas of Chinese food including Sichuan and Shandong. Most of their dishes are spicy so I wouldn't recommend if you can handle your chillies. Although compared to Sichuan food in Sichuan, it is actually quite mild. Dishes are quite large portions and made for sharing so not really suitable for single diners either. The restaurant has upstairs and downstairs seating although tables are still very limited due to how small the place is. It is very nostalgic of my memories of China with it's dullness and \u00a0basic wooden stools and tables. Not a very romantic place to be honest. We were seated upstairs and service was surprisingly friendly and efficient so the atmosphere improved drastically then. Tables filled up very quickly, mostly by Chinese customers.Aubergine with preserved duck egg, red pepper and garlicA lovely cold salad to start with a very satisfying contrast in textures from the deep fried slippery buttery aubergines and the crunchy diced red peppers and cucumbers. The preserved egg gave it the strong saltiness that did get a little too salty for me especially combined with \u00a0the seasoning. Better to save it with rice. Still a very cool refreshing start before the spicy dishes comes inCatfish in spiced gravy with Shendong pancakesTwo butterflied catfish still keeping its slippery tenderness and flaky texture even though both sides have been fried then coated in a rich sticky gravy. It was slightly over seasoned but the complexity of the sauce with the sweet, savoury, umami and mild spices made it worthwhile, especially with rice. I was also too in awe how moist and tender the fish was yet packed with flavour. I also highly recommend immersing the pancakes in the gravy or at least soaking them so they take on some flavour, as well as making them pliable again as they were almost rock hard like they weren't freshly madeRed braised duck with konjakuA dish to avoid. They were really tight with the amount of duck. Most of it was little bits of broken bone. But we weren't missing out as the meat was so overcooked it was dry, dense and almost flavourless. The chilli soup it was immerse in was bland and lacklustre, lacking depth and complexity. It actually become helpful to reduce the saltiness of the catfish dish.Wasn't the best dish to serve it was konjaku either (people may know it was the zero-calorie noodle) that had no flavour of its own and just there with its rubbery bouncy texture. Wasn't very welcomed in the dish.Mr Xie's Dan Dan noodles with mince beefThe cheapest yet the best dish of the lot (\u00a34.50). The portion is quite small, more a side dish than a meal of it's own being served in a rice bowl. The noodles were soft and bouncy and very fragrant in its egginess. It was in the perfect ratio of mince meat and gravy too, just enough to coat it in sauce and provide the stickiness for the well marinated mince meat to cling on. All very well seasoned and a piece of pak choi just to break up the stodginess.Although I didn't get to try a lot of the dishes offered I don't think it will be a place I returned to. Dishes were quite overpriced for what they were, \u00a314.50 for the red braised duck that was barely edible or had much ingredients in there other the broth. Some of the dishes were too salty and almost all the dishes had room for improvement. The atmosphere doesn't exactly make up for it either. With so much competition in area I don't see this one lasting very long in Chinatown unless I managed to go on a bad day,",

    "text": "Warning: do go here before a night out because you will invariably eat too much and want to go into a food coma and you will knock any potential lovers out with your intense garlic breath. And besides, it's easier to get a table midweek. Food here is pretty flavoursome and not too gentrified. There is a lot of oil throughout but with clever ordering you can balance those oilier dishes out with cleaner, drier dishes. There is a lot of pork mince/beef mince sprinkled incorporated within the dishes like a garnish really. I'd say the highlights of this place involve a lovely combo of veg and meat such as the fish fragrant aubergine with pork and the pot of tofu with pork and don't forget the dried fried beans and pork (all mince). The menu sounds pretty hot but it's not too crazy. That being said, you probably won't have to ask for more chilli (unless you are hardcore). Make sure you get the snack cucumber as it compliments all of the dishes and share everything. Staff are so lovely here don't forget to add service. Oh and bonus! the toilets are super clean.",

    "text": "Baiwei means \"a hundred flavours\" in Chinese. It indeed offers many delicious flavours, but one is particularly dominating: spicy!A very promising new kid in the hood, Baiwei specializes in Sichuan cuisine. Through a seemingly narrow entrance, it actually occupies 3 floors (ground, upper level and basement). Quite a lot of seatings available. Not a huge fan of the propaganda theme, but the space is pretty clean and neat in general so I'm not complaining. On to the food. - Chengdu Mao Cai(\u6210\u90fd\u5192\u83dc): \u00a0It's very similar to a hotpot, the main difference is that it comes already cooked in a big clay pot. You can choose 3 types of meat/seafood and 3 vegetables from many. It came quickly with a side of sesame dipping sauce to balance off the heat. And man it was SO GOOD that towards the end of the meal some of us were still searching for the bits and pieces of anything remained in the pot.- Fatty beef in sour soup(\u9178\u6c64\u80a5\u725b): One of my favorite. The beef is thinly sliced and tender, the soup base is spicy with chili pepper and peppercorn, \u00a0sour from rice vinegar. The flavour dances on my tongue and it's the best with some rice on the side. - Spicy dry pot with twice cooked pork (\u9ebb\u8fa3\u9999\u9505\u56de\u9505\u8089): Another pot of mixed meat and veggies, but it comes stir fried instead of stewed. The flavour is good, however it had too many peppercorns mixed among the food. It's unfortunate because it numbs your tongue so quickly and you have to pick it out. One suggestion would be heat the oil with peppercorns first and get rid of them before putting the rest of the ingredients. Or choose the peppercorn strings on vine so it's easier to pick them out. - Fish in spicy oil (\u6c34\u716e\u9c7c): Unlike its peers it wasn't presented with a million chili peppers on top. It was good but not outstanding. However, it's offered at a special price of 6 pounds! Dare I say it's about the cheapest, biggest dish you can get in London. - Braised pork belly (\u7ea2\u70e7\u8089): \u00a0Surprisingly delicious! Sweet, tender, a bit fatty, just the way I like it. Great contrast with all the spicy dishes we had. Veggies were pretty good and reasonably priced too. The service was very friendly and accommodating. I wasn't sure about the size of our party in the beginning but they managed to seat all of us with last minute changes. The menus were extensive and well presented, and I saw them cleaning each menu after being used. I'll definitely go back!",
