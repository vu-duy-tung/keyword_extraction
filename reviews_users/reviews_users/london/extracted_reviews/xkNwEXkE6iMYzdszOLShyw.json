    "text": "Pickled eggs. A bored looking teenager behind the counter. At least one very black chip. These are the things I've come to be accustomed to from a standard chip shop. Kerbisher and Malt has none of these. It's different yet feels familiar and I'd go as far as to say it may well be the best fish and chip shop I've experienced. Three weeks after eating there, we're still raving about it. Obviously take away is an option, but it's worth taking time to eat in the clean, minimalist nautical-themed cafe area, if only to whet your appetite with the dishes coming out of the kitchen. The fish is among some of the freshest I've ever tasted from a chippy - and I used to frequent Westcountry fishing towns a lot - and is offered in a batter, special light breadcrumbs or grilled. Having tried both of the latter, I'd be seriously tempted to go for the grilled option every time. As for the extras, the chips are neither too thick or too stingy, and have a pleasing texture. Most importantly, the mushy peas are spot on. Equally impressive are the list of specials and sides. Just to check it wasn't just the basics, we ordered a delicious fennel salad. Perfect.",

    "text": "So I've been resisting going in here because it looked a bit like a place that would try and make fish and chips all posh and ridiculously expensive. That's not what I think fish and chips is all about.Anyway, how wrong my perception was. I just had battered Pollack and chips, the missus had Matzo fried Plaice and chips and the boy had fish nuggets and chips, drinks and extra tartare sauce and the bill came to \u00a320 odd pounds. About a fiver more than I'd expect to pay in a bog standard chippie. Difference being that this was some of the best fish and chips I've eaten. The batter on my pollack was thin crispy and totally exceptional. The fish inside cooked absolutely perfectly. Moist. Unmistakeably fresh fillet too. The plaice was cooked with the same care. I didn't get to try the nuggets because they got wolfed down.Chips were like a good version of normal chip shop chips. Not the ridiculous posh chunks you get in good restaurants. Not the greasy mess you get in the chippie. Just a good quantity of well prepared chips. moreish. Filling. Lovely. We bought some tartare sauce for 30p.It came in a huge pot and was lush home made mayonnaise with chopped gherkin and fresh dill. Delicious. And to think that we pay 10p for that rubbish in sachets at a lot of places. Great stuff.We ate in. Nice surroundings. A little spartan for me to be honest and lacking atmos, but who cares? That was fish and chips as is should be at an excellent fair price. An absolute winner.There is obviously a good culture there. They have literature which talks about getting their stuff from only sustainable sources which is becoming more and more important. I'll be showing my support by eating lots and lots of fish and chips from there from now on. Got to be committed and all that!",

    "text": "Outside of London I'm sure this wouldn't have the reverence it has. What it offers is good quality fish and chips, nothing more, nothing less. Anywhere else and it'd have competition, but the fact that there isn't anything to compare is what causes people to gush about this place.It's damn good though, and good fish and chips can be such a rarity that I'll forgive its price inflation for what you get. When I say good, I mean well cooked fish, freshly battered with not too much and chips that have the perfect balance of cripness and softness.Perhaps the two things which make this a cut above the rest are:1. The place doesn't smell of fish.It's rare for anywhere that deals in fish prep not to have this, but it is possible. That smell is not a good smell or standard for any fishery. It just means that they are not serious about cleaning the place.2. Your food is prepared freshly for you.Takes a bit longer, but the net result is food that hasn't been sitting under a hot lamp, slowly spoiling.Simple things done well. None of this should be notable, but the fact it is shows that they've spotted their gap and are doing it well.Pro tip: Want fish and chips but want to pretend you're not a fatty fat fat? Go for the mazo meal covering on the fish instead. Still tastes damn good, but a lot less battery than batter.",

    "text": "In my first couple of weeks in London I was very excited to see a fish and chips event and also get chosen for this Qype event! There can't be a better way to start my new food adventures in London than with the national dish. Wandering in a few minutes late, I was warmly greeted with a delicious glass of Muscadet which I preferred over my next favorite, a bottle of dandelion and burdock. They also provided glasses of sherry which I personally was not a huge fan of. Being a fish and chips novice, I was pleased that there are many beverage options to pair with. For whatever reason I thought beer was the standard pairing. They started out the night with some whitebait and calamari in a deliciously light batter which paired perfectly with the bubbly Muscadet. The owners Nick and Saul told us not only everything we need to know about fish and chips in general, but why they do what they do to provide the best product possible.This means fresh not frozen fish, no preservatives, and homemade batter. We were provided a sample of 1. Three preparations of fish (grilled, matzo, and battered)- My favorite of the night was the battered. Perfectly crisp outside with a tempura like texture. This fish was lusciously moist and fresh of course! 2. Chips- Just the right amount of crunch with fluffy white goodness inside and also not too salty 3. Mushy peas- This was my first time trying mushy peas ever and it was delicious. To me, the name doesn't sound so appetizing but I could have licked my plate clean if that wasn't so inappropriate. 4. and a wonderfully refreshing fennel and dill salad To top it off, the ambiance was clean, warm and inviting. I will be back for sure when I need to fulfill my fish and chip cravings!",

In fact, Kerbisher and Malt don't even serve meat, but don't let this put you off; Kerbisher are passionate about their fish, so much so that they don't open on Mondays as Billingsgate Fish Market is closed on this day, meaning no fresh fish. I was lucky enough to try a selection of their fish at the Qype event on Monday: breaded, battered and steamed. I have to say that of all the varieties the battered was my favourite. The batter was delicious and what really set Kerbisher and Malt apart from other chip shops was their chips, delightfully crispy and cooked twice. I'm a huge fan of their sides and I couldn't get enough of the lemon mayonnaise.",

But as I'm never one to be impolite and turn down free food I gave it a go, and I'm so glad I did! It was the best fish I've ever tasted, combined with top notch chips, an amazing fennel salad (if nothing else you must order that) and a large glass of wine it was quite simply delicious. The staff really know what they are talking about so if you want any recommendations or to try something new, ask. Anyway to sum up, I'm a changed man now I only like my fish deep fried and cod unless it is from kerbisher and malt",

    "text": "On Tuesday evening Lanky Girl and Co went to an event hosted by Qype at Kerbisher and Malt a rather cute and contemporary chip shop on Shepherds Bush Road in Hammersmith. Fish and Chips are one of those dishes that everyone tends to have strong opinions about. I went to the event thinking I knew as much as there was to know about fish and chips but came away surprised at how much I didn't know. Being brought up in East London I can remember enjoying countless trips to our local chip shop Brothers when either of my parents couldn't be bothered to cook. No other chip shop I have visited has been able to better my childhood chippy until now! Kerbisher and Malt's selling point is the fact that the food is stripped down, unadulterated and tasty! For the environmentally conscious it is helpful to know that: The fish they buy is fresh and bought unfrozen from Billingsgate market from sustainable stock.They make their own batter from scratch and fish is available to buy battered, grilled or covered in matzo meal. The chips are double fried and the oil they use is recycled into bio fuel. I was particularly impressed when they told us their food was free from preservatives and additives.On entering the restaurant we were received by founders Nick and Saul who proceeded to give us a history of how they started and what makes their fish and chips so good. We were also were given fried calamari that I'm not embarrassed to say I could not stop eating! To try we were given Cod, Coley and haddock to try and many of us could not tell the difference much to my chagrin. For someone who doesn't like batter having the option of grilled fish was perfect. The fish tasted fresh, perfectly cooked and delicious. We also enjoyed chips, fennel salad, homemade baked beans and a glass of sherry. By the end of the meal I was stuffed and smiling! Kerbisher and Malt definitely deserve the praise that has seen it voted best contemporary chip shop in Britain by Esquire magazine. Lanky Girl's verdict? Easily the best fish and chips I have tasted in a long time. Next time you're in Hammersmith definitely pay them a visit.",

    "text": "Holy freaking god. There are no two ways about it: this place serves up the best chip-shop fish that I have ever eaten in my whole life, ever. Ever.The only reason I knew of Kerbisher & Malt's existence was reading a mention of it as being the \"best fish and chip shop in London\". Turns out, according to their menu, that I got the accolade slightly wrong; in fact, it was named London's \"best contemporary chippy\" by Esquire magazine. Still, that's not to be sniffed at, and since it is a mere five minute drive from my new pad, it seemed frankly daft not to give it a go.My mum and I - self-proclaimed connoisseurs of this traditional dish - popped in post-decoration of the aforementioned new pad, exhausted and covered in paint. We ordered two battered haddock and chips, one side of mushy peas, one beer and one lemonade which came to about \u00a325.But firstly, the fish itself. Oh, but it was divine; cooked to perfection and falling apart in succulent, juicy flakes. Alongside the traditional dishes they offer a range of cooking methods (battered, grilled or matzo meal). The Jewish side of me lurched towards the latter but I'm English born-and-bred so plumped for the popular option: an indescribably light and fluffy batter with the perfect crisp coverage; no open spaces, no excess dripping off the edge. The chips were not, perhaps, as good as those found at the excellent Mrs Marengos, which in my opinion are virtually impossible to surpass, but nonetheless a great complement to the main dish. The mushy peas could perhaps have done with a little extra seasoning and a bit more cooking of the solid peas themselves. \u00a0I would have had the homemade tartare sauce but unfortunately ordered in too much of a hurry to notice its existence on the menu. \u00a0Part of me thinks that that was probably a good thing, because it allowed me to enjoy the deliciousness of the fish in all its glory with no culinary distractions.Kerbisher & Malt has a feeling like it ought to be over in east London somewhere - not due to pretentions or being painfully hip, but perhaps down to its clean, retro-modern intererior and quietly British theme - but as a west-London girl, I'm delighted that it isn't. I loved the decor and the friendly staff (my meal was cheerfully delivered by the chef himself) and the carefully-chosen menu, which was pleasantly extensive but not overly taxing in terms of making a decision. \u00a0They have four beers, all from the London brewery Meantime (in keeping with the \"local produce\"), plus a range of soft drinks from Fentimans. My mum had a lemonade which was so good that she ordered another. Yup, even the drinks are excellent.This place so nearly gets five stars from me - in fact, I wavered between four and five several times whilst writing this review - but I think that it *just* misses out. It's a 4.5, which is a shame because the fish really is phenomenal and the service is delightful, but I'm going to be harsh if only because the restaurant is still in its infancy and therefore has plenty of opportunity for improvement. If they can perfect the chips and the peas, then they won't be able to keep me away. I honestly didn't want that haddock to end. I savoured every morsel and wiped my plate clean. I'll be back . . . just try and stop me.",

This is just one of the many great things that I learnt about Britain's national dish at the latest Qype event. I also learnt that fish tastes better with the skin off and that fennel and dill salad is a great counterpart to fish and chips. Although it has to be said not as great a counterpart as Kerbisher and Malt's own lemon mayonnaise \u00a0that stuff is so tasty that I was tempted to stock up while I was here. It's a bargain at just 50p! Of course, unless you're me, you probably won't visit here just for lemon mayonnaise, and I'm pleased to report that the fish and chips are delicious. We tried three varieties of fish and of them all, the battered fish was my favourite. The batter was light and crisp, and I couldn't get enough of the chips which are double-cooked to their own unique recipe. Coming from the coast, I thought that it wasn't possible to get good fish and chips in London, but Kerbisher and Malt have proved me so wrong. I'll definitely be coming here again and not just for the mayonnaise!",

    "text": "So I was invited and head the pleasure to visit my favourite chippy Kerbisher and Malt. It was pleasant for the owners to teach us about getting 'good fish and chips' and this is the reason why I think they are so ahead of the market. Arrived and enjoyed the networking and complimentary drinks and au d'oeuvres. Amazing. The owners Saul and Nick introduced their concept and advised the difference on how they source and make their fish and chips. It was interesting as it certainly tells in the flavour. Much to everyones joy we were provided with three different types of fish and each one was cooked in a different way, battered, grilled or Matzo which is breadcrumbed. The chips were cooked twice and this provided a crispy lovely chip not too chunky and not too think like fries. These were complimented with their own made lemon mayonnaise, sweet chilli sauce and tartare. Not want to sound too much like a critic but these were amazing. Cannot fault. All sides were sampled and plenty offered and have to champion the mushy peas and home made baked beans. These made the meal complete and my table was quiet. We were served Muscadet, sherry and additional soft drinks. I normally have a soft drink with my fish and chips. As we had an American who just had arrived to London we thought it was good to give her Dandelion and Burdock and she loved it! It was a joy to hear Kerbisher and Malts view on what they were serving and could clearly see their passion hypnotising the rest of us. Saul and Nick were clearly open to hear all thoughts and opinions and you know what they had them all covered. They have perfected a good nights meal here. Well done for T to organise this event and long live Kerbisher and Malt.",

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

Rackham \u00c7evirisi On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.",

    "text": "Great first meal to have in london! We were very hungry after our flight and dropping off our luggage at the hotel so we looked up the best places to eat nearby. K&M was down the street and the reviews were amazing so we made a unanimous decision to come here! The yelp page doesn't have the right hours posted so we came a little too early before they opened for dinner, but they had outdoor seatings so we waited until they opened. The girl taking our order was very friendly and took our order quickly. I ordered the fish(haddock)& chips of course and they were absolutely amazing! They came out steaming hot and the fish was very juicy and tender on the inside while the outside was fried to perfection.Only downside was the puddle of oil at the bottom of my plate which made it a little unappetizing everytime i tried forking a chip and all the oil would ooze/bubble around it. I got sick of it faster as well because of the oil so i didn't finish all my food, but the portions are also very large so that could also be a reason why. Seems like this is the go to place for locals and tourists trying to grab some good authentic fish&chips so this is definitely a must try for everyone! I have to look for a shop selling fish&chips as delicious as K&M in the LA area now, but this will probably be the best i will ever have. If i ever decide to come back to london, i'm definitely stopping by again!",

I'm full of self-congratulations and smuggness up until I walk past Kerbisher & Malt. The smell alone makes me want to erase all my good-doing with a healthy dose of fried naughtiness.Believe me, I was doing oh-so-well until one wet and windy Friday night when I couldn't crack it any more. I called my flat mate, ending with the words \"I'll meet you there\". Inside, it felt like THIS is the way fish and chips should be done. Retro decor, friendly smiley girls behind the counter. A great range of sides and condiments and fast service. One of my favourite elements of this tiny restaurant is that they have a screen of the kitchen, so you can see the chefs at work. Makes the short waiting time fly by!The food, to be honest, was a little disappointing. It could be my common palate, but I couldn't help dismissing the fact that the fish was friendly-farmed, the tartare sauce was homemade and the ginger beer was organic. The chips were a little soggy (lacked that crispy/greasy/guilty element of most fish and chip shop chips) and the fish tasted very average. at \u00a310 a head for a non-alcoholic drink, fish, chips, mushy peas and tarare sauce - it's better value than most fish and chip places any road. What I'd go back for is the sense of community spirit they created in such a small, new place. The waitresses greating old boys and girls like they were family. Leaving us with a \"hope to see you again soon!\". And I'm sure they will!",

Truth be told, I've never thought of myself as a fish and chips type of chick which is why it's taken me so long to try this beloved dish. For me, the meal was just too much fried food which was completely expected since I was eating fried fish and chips (and onion rings). None of it sat well with me and I was up all night with heartburn but that's not really the fault of Kerbisher & Malt. I just can't handle fried food and this meal was fried food overload.Together, my husband and ordered a battered plaice, battered cod, onion rings, chips, coleslaw, and two brews (delicious).My plaice was bland. There was absolutely no seasoning in the breading. Since I don't do tartar or any type of sauce (I like it straight-up with lemon juice which there wasn't enough of), I basically ate fried batter and fish and it tasted like nothing. I should have ordered a side of fennel and dill because I think that probably would have bumped this review up to four stars.The chips were good. The onion rings were good but they caused me to burp onion burps for the next 24 hours which is not sexy at all. The coleslaw was downright terrible. No flavor or even flavour. The space is neat. Loved the white subway tile and the menu painted on the wall. Seating was comfortable and ordering was orderly and easy. Food came out quick with no fuss.The space is also small with seating for about 20 people. There is a very long table which seats 12 which was filled with three separate groups of American tourists who \"made it all the way to Hammersmith\" to try the fish and chips. LOL.Would not return for the mere fact that I'm not a fish and chips lover and for me to eat fish and chips, it's got to be really damn good fish and chips.",

I hadn't had it in over a decade, but I like pretty much anything fried, so I knew I was guaranteed to eat whatever was put in front of me.I wasn't expecting this to be as good as it was!! I'm ashamed to say I ate it all. (If you've been reading my other reviews, you'll notice a trend.) I had the battered haddock with chips, and everything was cooked so perfectly. The fish is cooked to order, so it was super fresh and not greasy at all. (I'm looking back at my picture and can't believe I ate the whole thing - the piece of fish was HUGE!) I had it with tartare sauce and a bottle of cider. As simple as this dish is, I don't think it could have gotten any better than that. K&M itself has sort of a kitchen / cafeteria vibe, with bright lights and a clean, casual setting. I wouldn't necessarily come here for a date night, but I would come running for their fish & chips again for sure.",

    "text": "This is a very nice fish and chip shop, with good quality fish. The chips are decent and the fish is well done, the only reason I give this 4 stars is due to the fact that it is more expensive than similar standard places. It's a tad overpriced, especially if you take away the modern aesthetic of the restaurant. The fish is fresh though, despite being in London, so I give it 4 stars. I would recommend if you don't mind forking out a little extra money for a good meal.",

The fried haddock was so moist with a perfect crust and the chips were great, but the sauces put it over the top: the homemade tarter, the chipotle mayo and red curry sauces were delish! I would've been satisfied with the malt vinegar but the sauces were such an added plus. Now here's where it got my fifth star - the mushy peas. They were so good, I would go here just for them. They also served their own beer by the bottle to tie things all together, plus a few other tasty microbrews. The salad was fresh, but my favorite side after the peas was the fennel and dill salad. They has a children's menu and even provided colored pencils. The service was quick, \u00a0attentive and extremely friendly.",

Kerbisher & Malt is a small chippy right between Shepherds Bush and Hammersmith. The interior is really nice, subway tiles down the walls, bright and very clean. I had the small fish and chips special. A small portion of coley, chips and a sauce for a fiver. First off, this wasnt small, I couldnt finish all the chips. It was so good! Hot, not greasy at all and no bones. Plus it was at least half the price of getting it at a pub. There were about 5 types of fish and a good selection of sauces as well. There were also some non fish choices on the menu. They had bottled beer and various sodas and waters \u00a0to drink. I am delighted to have found something so close to home when I have a craving and nice to know I can eat in or take away. Will absolutely be back.",

See to date the only one that has pulled off the balance in all regards is FishClub in Clapham Common(they say Clapham Junction has one), but somehow they closed...go figure. But this was close. Chips had some leftover chips from earlier and not just a few. But staff were really nice polite and very accommodating...i'll check out their Abbeville road location to check for consistency.

It's a pretty simple format: wander up to the till, choose your food (including a range of different possible fish), pay and wait. The interior is tiled and slightly retro. The service is friendly.The food however was overall slightly below what I was expecting given its reputation. The fish is indeed excellent - quite possibly indeed the best battered fish I've had in London. However, the chips were quite a bit below par in a city that now touts several excellent burger joints alongside established greasy spoons like the Regency Cafe in Westminster. And alas, my first servings of mushy peas tasted burnt. The replacements were much better.So overall, pretty good - particularly the fish. There's room for improvement on the chips though.",

One was clearing tables without looking up, the one behind the corner was beyond commenting on the menu but luckily told us we had just a few minutes before the place closed.With a different attitude they could probably have persuaded us to order and finish our meal outside, I'm glad they didn't even try as we chanced upon the most charming cafe just a few minutes away.",

Anyways, the quality of this fish and chips was my preferred of the two places we tried. The portions are very large to boot. My husband and I each ordered a fish and chips meal-his with cod and mine with haddock. Instead of mushy peas, we asked for double chips but were told they can't do that (ok.....). The fish was flaky and the batter was crisp. The chips were hot, fresh cut, and crisp. They lacked flavor though. They sell extra sauces so we tried the chipotle mayonnaise, which was superior (IMO) to the tarter sauce. It was delicious with both the chips and fish. I'd suggest ordering 2. The atmosphere is very casual in that you order at the counter and pay with your food being delivered to your table later. They also do a brisk takeaway business. I was satisfied with our meal here and found the price point to be reasonable for the quality and quantity of food. I'd definitely suggest visiting if you are in the area and looking for fish and chips!",

After talking with a few folks, I received a lot of recommendations for Kerbisher & Malt. So for a mid-week dinner in the Hammersmith area, I headed over to see what I thought.There were 5 different kinds of fish on the menu, several which I was familiar with (haddock and cod), and a few I was not. I decided to try Plaice, battered of course, with chips and a side of mushy peas and bread and butter. The fish had a flaky texture to it and was quite juicy, and the batter on the fish was very well done. British beer battering is definitely different from a lot of fish and chips found stateside, but I enjoyed the flavor and texture quite a bit. The mushy peas were not my cup of tea, but I was glad I tried them, as they were prepared well. The fries that came with the fish were quite good and are fresh cut in house. You could taste the freshness, and the double frying really did them justice.Kerbisher & Malt is unassuming from the outside and fairly small inside. You order your food first, find a table, and they bring it out to you when it is ready. The prices were very reasonable, the portion sizes good, and the quality also quite good. I personally prefer fish and chips I get in coastal cities in the US to the British variety, but even so I really enjoyed my meal and would definitely return when back in London.",

We ordered the cod & it was absolutely delicious. The fish was perfectly flakey, moist, & the batter was really nice. The chips were pretty good, but you know, I'm American, so I prefer them to be extra crispy rather than chunky. The pickled onion rings were so great - I really wish this caught on in America. Pickled onion flavors for daAaAys. The mushy peas were okay, not the greatest (needed a little something extra & was more watery than mushy). Probably wouldn't order that again, but pickled onion rings, yaaaas qu333n yaas. Highly recommend if you're in the area. It's a really nice chippy; more on the hipster side & very clean.

Cooking methods can be grilled or fried (in original breadcrumbs or matzo) and you'll get chips too! There are a few different sauces available.

The fish and chips were pretty average and were satisfactory for someone that has nevere had them, which was me, but the price seemed a bit high considering that there are trucks outside offering the same British delicacy for half the cost. The overall experience was pretty good, but there were just a little pricey in my opinion.",

    "text": "If this is \"the best chippy in town\" then I guess I'd better just go to Poppie's.First of all, the staff stopped me quite abruptly when I rushed to the loo while entering (It was an urgent call!). While I appreciate the sentiment of not wanting strangers to just come in and piss in your pot, this is more of a restaurant or pub thing in central, and this, with all due respect, is a chippy in Shepard's Bush.A more relaxed attitude would better suit them.To the point: the fish is good, the chips depressingly mediocore. They charge for the first serving of tartare as well, which kind of annoyed me - but their tartare is one of the best I've had. Sadly it can't and shouldn't carry the weight of the drab floury chips.",

It's definitely a little upscale compared to your average chippy shop but I'm not complaining.We ordered our cod and chips for takeaway with a side of curry sauce. Very delicious! I was surprised how amazing the curry sauce was! I'd consider coming back here just for the curry sauce. It was crowded on a Saturday night around 9pm so beware if you plan on coming around peak hours. I'll definitely be back to try the mushy peas. :)",

    "text": "I decided to try this place last week, hearing about the best fish and chips in town! My friend and I ordered the \"light fish and chips special\", which was a good portion of deep fried Coley fish with chips and a side sauce (we chose lemon mayo). It was enough to fill me up, and I tend to have a large appetite!I can appreciate the freshness of the fish; the Coley is a thicker cut of fish so you had about two inches thick of fish for every layer of deep-fried goodness- probably healthier for you, right? The chips were of good quality. I'd say the taste was clean, well-executed. I don't think the flavors were original at all, but meddle with that and you meddle with a lot of expectations! Overall, a good portion of fish and chips served fresh for \u00a36.",

    "text": "This is easily one of my favorite places in Hammersmith. This is a tiny fish and chip shop located on a busy street (what street isn't busy in London?) close to a great little park called Brook Green for you to be able to enjoy your food (hint, hint).It's London, so don't expect it to be cheap if you are an American traveler. The exchange rate will kill you unless you are travelling on business like I was. Go with the cod and chips. I didn't find the haddock to be that flavorful, no fault of K&M. The tartar sauce is a must. Get two or three containers and enjoy.The best part? If you have issues trying to figure out the demonstrations of the change in the UK, the cashier will help you. While I eventually figured it out, I thought it was funny to be offered such a basic service with no sarcasm behind it.",

This place is well of the beaten path for most tourists since there is nothing really to see in Hammersmith but I promise if you make the trek to this place you won't be disappointed. First off they offer 4 different types of fish (I had the haddock). It's served as a massive filet SKIN OFF (as it should be in my opinion) and was light and fluffy. Add malt vinegar and a bit of their homemade tartar sauce and BAM! Winner winner fish dinner! They did not have any beer on tap BUT they had meantime lager which made a good pairing for the dinner... Hands down the best of the 4 places I had fish an chips on this trip...",

As for the calamari, it tasted pretty good but it would've be better if it was more crispy. As for the cole slaw, I didn't really like it since it seems a bit under seasoned. As for the sauces, the sweet chili was amazing. The tartare sauce is like any other tartare sauce. The fish definitely deserve 4 stars, but the other stuff should be 3 stars. Overall, definitely worth a try.",
