The fare is pretty standard; nothing you can't find elsewhere, but it is the signature Penne Giardinera that I return to Carluccio's for. I also do not find Carluccio's value-for-money. You can get similar quality food from your local Italian for half the price. The restaurant is also a little crammed. Most of the time I feel like I am eavesdropping on my neighbours' intimate conversations!",

We had the liver pate which was smooth as butter and so very tasty. Betty had the Milanese de polo with a substitution of pasta for the roasted potatoes. I had the carbonara and with both had side salads. The breaded chicken was pounded thin and yet was still juicy and the coating was delicious. My carbonara was cooked perfectly and had a great taste that was only accentuated by the taste of the bacon. The salads were better than expected for a side salad. I believe we will be back.",

Although it's a good, decently-sized site, it's popular to the point of being oversubscribed. The queue was good-humoured though and moved at a reasonable pace. Another small downside - before I get on to the good stuff - is the volume of the noise; the chatter levels here (due to the layout and popularity) are so high on the decibel scale that it won't be to everyone's taste or tolerance. The menu, as in all their caff\u00e8s, has something for (almost) everyone and the staff seem very tolerant to eclectic combinations. I was in a veggie mood and opted for a starter-size of the vegetarian antipasti: delicious as ever, and I supplemented it with a side of their perfectly cooked fresh spinach. Accompanied by some of their walnut bread, it didn't disappoint but I was sorry to see that the smoked mackerel pat\u00e9 (sgombro) no longer appears on the menu. My companions were very happy with their parma ham, risotto milanese and arancini (rice balls); I sampled the mozzarella one - and found it much more flavoursome than I remembered. We shared a light dessert of chocolate meringue with blackberry sauce - a great taste success! The service was efficient and smiling (although not Italian).",

While it was snazzy and cool when introduced a few years ago, the persistent high prices and diffident service is proving more and more of an irritation, especially in these troubled economic times. Also, the tendency to cram as many people together is annoying for the prices charged. Basically, the food is expensive and has gone downhill over the years, and to make it worse, the wines are also sadly overpriced. It was a fun place to hang out a few years ago but these days there are many better (and cheaper) places than this tourist pit. I rate the place as extremely overpriced for what it delivers.",

This is not the first time I've been to Carluccio's, as someone who's based in South Kensington, I've known this place for years and had only been once, once and never again - probably due to the very indifferent food.This time, I'm sitting here, writing a review, because I'm super bored after waiting for my food for an hour.This place is very noisy, if you don't like noisy food place, please avoid Carluccio's..Once the food arrived (if it arrives...), I'll update this review to give you an idea of how long you will have to wait for the food...Update 1:Still waiting for the food, it's 14.50 now. This place isn't even busy. All my mates are starving.Luckily - there's a Pret A Manger next door... if in 5 minutes, food still don't arrive, I'll just run next door to get myself a sandwich...Update 2:Food portion is too tiny...Update 3:When tried to get the bill, they ignored us for at least 5 times.Update 4: Racist waitress...don't want to say more on it. I went with 5 whites to this place, very unpleasant experience...",

    "text": "I always seem to have problems with the restaurants in the Carluccios chain. They're never all that significant but I feel like they could always be a bit better somehow. Sadly, this visit was another example of this.First off some good service from our waiter, who had no trouble making sure we got two n'duja and mozzarella arancini rather than one, plus a Gorgonzola one. Then it just became a bit irritating sub average afterwards. This isn't to say anything was bad, but nothing was great.The arancini were delicious. Garlic bread, again, good. My main? Well the pasta was cooked perfectly but the chicken was just funky and the sauce may have been pure unseasoned cream as far as I know. It was improved a lot by dumped a load of salt and pepper into it, but despite an interesting description on the menu, it just didn't meet my expectations.Again, not bad, just pretty meh. My only real issue is the density of the tables in here. When there are so many that a waiter has trouble getting between them then I'm sure that's too many tables. But the restaurant is in South Ken, so I can understand that volumes are put above the customer experience due to all the tourists.",

Our waiter was doing that 'I'm your new friend/aren't I handsome' thing that just seems sleazy and is obviously just tip begging, and then when I didn't appear charmed enough (he wasn't at all charming) he just shut it off and we basically didn't see him again. The restaurant was busy but not packed, but the tables are so close together that it feels very cramped and crowded. The table next to us had to put their hand in the air and wave at the waiter to get his attention from where he stood by the bar not doing anything discernible.I guess I just need a reminder every once in a while to avoid this chain. Thanks Carluccios, my memory is refreshed.",

It's a little pricy if you go for the a la carte menu but I got the 3 course menu for around \u00a315 which was pretty good. I had the Chicken liver pate with caramalised onion and toast. Very very good.Italian chicken milanese. Basically a chicken schnitzel with some rocket and potatoes. The potatoes were a little salty, but the portion was perfect and chicken perfectly cooked and mouth-watering.Dessert was a panna cotta with rum infused orange peel. Exceedingly rich and whilst lovely I couldn't finish it all.In terms of service our waiter was great. My food seemed to have more problems that anyone else, since I was the only person to order from the set menu and items came our erattically. E.g. Despite asking for my food to come out with everyone else's to prevent them having to wait for me. My starter came out before everyone's main, but then my main seem to \u00a0have been forgotten and there was a small wait. Similar situation with dessert. I'm not one to hold it against them as the place was pretty busy with lots of big tables and they did a great job in the situation ensuring we always got what we needed quickly after grabbing a member of staff's attention and ensuring food came out mostly at the same time.I'd come back to this chain again for sure. It's a safe bet for good quality food that is nothing mind-blowing but simple, safe and hearty.",

    "text": "Unbeknownst to us, as tourists, we had not known that Carluccio's was a chain restaurant :( But the cute interior and tempting menu seemed very inviting so we stayed. I started my dinner with the Arancini di Riso. Two crispy fried rice balls one flavored with a basil pesto and one with a meat ragu filling, served with a side of red pepper dipping sauce. The basil was my favorite of the two, offering a balanced creamy and savory interior. The meat ragu filling was a bit bland. I couldn't really taste the ragu or any tomato-type flavor and I'm not quite sure I even recall any meat in the ball(?). The arancini's flavor was enhanced when I used the red pepper dipping sauce. Both were cooked perfectly with a nice creamy, chewy texture and a light crispy, crunchy exterior. For my main dish the Risotto special. (I didn't really think my selections through, starting with rice balls and having rice again for dinner!) The special that day was Risotto with chicken and spinach. A hearty dish that actually tasted like a warm bowl of chicken noodle soup. Creamy, chewy risotto tossed with tender chunks of white meat chicken and spinach leaves. A plate of comfort food...just wished the spinach was chopped smaller. Some of the large wilted leaves had a mushy texture and were unappetizing. Service was prompt, however, not super friendly and the food came out timely and piping hot! The restaurant itself was pretty packed (I think we were there on a Monday or Tuesday night(?) )and noisy and the tables are close together. Not a huge problem, but it was difficult to have a conversation and to hear the server. They also have a cute mini store with a deli, bakery, books and sweet treats near the entrance of the restaurant and their barista was mixing coffees, teas and espressos exposed adjacent to the dining area. Overall good experience.",

Trust me they use good Italian olive oil. \u52a0\u4e00\u70b9\u9ed1\u80e1\u6912\u6216\u5976\u916a\u90fd\u4f1a\u6bd4\u4ec0\u4e48\u90fd\u4e0d\u52a0\u597d\u5f88\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u52a0\u4e86\u592a\u591a\u5c31\u4f1a\u50cf\u6211\u4e00\u6837\u5403\u8fc7\u540e\u5c31\u8981\u559d\u5927\u91cf\u7684\u6c34\u3002\u4ed6\u4eec\u5728\u53f6\u5b50\u4e0a\u52a0\u5165\u7684\u662f\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u6a44\u6984\u6cb9",
