    "text": "A group of us were treated to a morning at Chipotle's second restaurant in London, which has been open for a couple of months now, in order to get a better understanding of this American burrito chain.The proposition is Food with Integrity as indicated by the chicken listed as Higher Welfare on the menu! Our experience of being tutored in how to make the in-house guacamole certainly showed that Chipotle have a passion for ingredients and food preparation. They represent the better aspects of the American attitude towards food.My pork (outdoor reared) burrito was tasty and filling \u00a0qualifying as a full meal as far as I'm concerned, although I did include a dollop of guacamole at an extra cost of \u00a31.40 in addition to the burrito cost of \u00a36.95. Generally burritos are in the \u00a36.50 \u00a0\u00a36.95 price range.Given that there are now about 1,200 Chipotle restaurants in the US, which has a population about five times the size of the UK, that implies about 250 outlets could be opening up in the UK over the coming years if the popularity of the burrito takes off over here \u00a0and in my opinion that would be no bad thing.",

Well I got a burrito bowl which was pretty much the same as in the US. They were skimping on the rice and chicken. I don't know maybe I'm being a fat American but I guess I'm use to my Burrito Bowl being the size of a newborn baby... But seriously apart from that they did have very juicy chicken and steak. I took away a star for the cheapness while serving and another because they had a dirty lobby for not being very busy, plus they had at least 7 people working. I don't know if its a thing people in the UK are use to, but nobody would throw their trash away they would always leave their trays and cups on the table and just leave. This was a cute little surprise but I love Chipotle in the US!",

Store manager Jacob explained to us about the finely honed process surrounding their ingredients selection & constant quality control, and the sentence that still resounds in my mind from the morning was when he said: People think of burritos as fast food \u00a0what they don't see is the 12 hours of slow-food preparation we do behind the scenes so that they can get it in 5 minutes. The burritos at the Marylebone store are every bit as flavoursome, spicy, and fulfilling as the Charing Cross Road branch, which is handy to know because it's critical to be able to get a decent burrito no matter where you are in this amazing city.",

    "text": "Tucked away on a corner of Baker Street usually inhabited by (infested with?) large packs of spotty teenage tourists with matching yellow rucksacks of a Saturday morning, or suited office types of a weekday lunchtime, lies London's newest addition to the fast-growing world of quality fast food.As one who has always believed the phrase quality fast food to be completely incongruous in itself, and therefore who usually shuns fast food (fast), Chipotle is, admittedly, a place that on any other day I might pass-by without giving it a thought. It's unique to this country; sadly the idea of quality fast food has passed us poor Brits by, yet every time I visit the US \u00a0a deli in NYC or a burger joint in Portland, I am bowled-over by how decent the food is. On the other hand, your average UK sandwich shop or independent burger shop (Chicken Cottage, anyone? Subway? EW!) fill me with The Fear.Enter: Chipotle.By quality fast food, I mean that the ingredients are sourced by the restaurant directly, all food is created from scratch onsite and on the same day \u00a0even the tortilla chips \u00a0and more importantly, a great deal of care and love is pumped into all aspects of food creation.Chipotle is an American-Mexican restaurant which I dearly hope will play a small part in changing the game with UK fast food. Even I can bring myself to use the R word (rather than calling it a joint or mere outlet), especially when I know my quick-grab lunch is the product of about 6 hours of preparation by real cooks.It has a rather beautiful and quirky history; a chain with a soul, if you will. Despite its brief foray into some form of partnership with the proprietors of the Big Golden Arches (eeeevil), Chipotle has stayed true to its roots and sources its ingredients locally, where possible. Essentially that means: meats and vegetables from the UK. Of course there are exceptions: avocados are seasonal and they are mostly imported from far-off warm lands.To give you a quick idea of the level of care and knowledge that goes into the food here, our guide Jacob talked about the difference in flavour of avocados from various different countries and at different times of the year. We were moving into the time of the year where the Hass avocados are sourced from Chilli, which meant they wouldn't be perfect for another few weeks. Or what about the difference in flavour profile of guacamole depending on what kind of salt is used? Enough said, right? They know their stuff!The proof was in the pudding, though. The pork burrito with black bean and mild chilli and guac was absolutely superb.I'm all about a good burrito, it used to be difficult picking one up anywhere in London \u00a0especially to go \u00a0but it's getting easier these days.Don't be fooled: although Chipotle serves your lunch in 3 minutes flat, this is some seriously brilliant food.",

    "text": "For a quick bite, this can be a tasty and healthy option.First, a caveat. \u00a0I grew up in northern California decades ago and was weaned on this kind of food -- fresh, Americanized Mexican food. \u00a0I've since learned about authentic Mexican food (along with the rest of California) and I love that. \u00a0But I still have a place in my heart (stomach?) for fresh Cal-Mex cuisine like this. \u00a0(By the way, I've been in London so long that I have not been to a Chipotle in the US, so I won't be able to compare.)I went here for lunch and had a barbacoa (shredded) beef burrito. \u00a0The tortilla is nicely thin, tasty, and chewy. Not like the cold floury El Paso or Discovery ones. \u00a0They warm it right before they build your burrito. \u00a0You get a choice of white or brown (light brown, not dark) rice (or probably none). \u00a0I opted for the brown rice because I like that nutty flavor. \u00a0The rice has cilantro in it and is quite tasty on its own. You also have a choice of pinto or black beans. \u00a0I got the pinto (with pork fat). \u00a0Hot, medium, or mild salsa (I got hot, which has a respectable kick). Lettuce (romaine), sour cream, cheese, and guacamole. \u00a0There were also steak (cubed), chicken, pork carnitas and grilled veggies choices. \u00a0You can also get the stuff on a salad or a taco (not sure what kind of taco shell since I didn't see anyone with it). \u00a0They also offer side orders of tortilla chips (crisps), which I did not get but could tell by the looks of them that they are decent and not the annoyingly hard ones in most Mexican restaurants.This is very much your fill'er-up burrito that I used to get in California as a university student - the kind that gets you full on $3. \u00a0Now it's \u00a36.70, but you get the idea. \u00a0It's definitely fresh and quite tasty, and it certainly filled me up. \u00a0That's plenty of rather filling food (quite a bit more than a shawarma sandwich, I think). \u00a0I liked it very much, although I think next time, I would ask them to put in less rice and beans. \u00a0The only issue I have was that the wrap itself was so big that there's quite a bit of tortilla in the meal.The staff were friendly and quick (the long line at 12.45pm went very quickly). \u00a0The place was clean and kept clean. \u00a0Looking forward to going back soon.",

Whilst probably not the best burrito I've ever eaten, Chipotle definitely is in joint first place with Tortilla and on the way to being the best chain burrito place in London (I know they have a bizzillion places in the U.S already though)A pretty decent selection of meats, heavy (in a good way) on the farm assured ethical rearing of the animals, I chose to eat the carnitas (pork) with Guac while also getting a sideorder or tortilla chips. The burritos on offer here are definitely on the 'super size' scale of burritos - you're going to get a full lunch and possible meat sweats is all I'll say, while the guacamole tastes fresh and creamy (although \u00a31.20 extra for it does seem a little excessive). The only downside which I see time and time again in UK burrito joints is the absolute lack of knowledge and ability in rolling it. This time it looked more like the lady was parceling something up to send back home and it would only be a matter of minutes before she's sitting on it and strapping it with parcel tape to get it shut!! Put it this way, one end had Guac in it, one had sour cream - not the mix throughout that I'd have obviously preferred! Saying that, the tortilla chips are cooked fresh in front of you and have a taste that can't be beat so make sure you get an extra side of this to go with your burrito.",

Now, let me address the haters because I'm feeling particularly passionate about my love for Chipotle right now. Or maybe I'm just homesick. A lot of the arguments that are made in bad reviews just suck.#1 - It's more expensive than in the US. Well, DUH! Everything in London is more expensive than in the US. Haven't you heard the rule of thumb: everything in London is the same price as in the US, it's just denominated in pounds?#2 - It's not as big of a portion as in the US. First of all, my burrito tonight was huge and I'm pretty sure it's just as big as at home. Second, even if it were smaller, humans should not consume that much burrito in one sitting anyway so everyone would be better off if they were smaller. P.S. If Americans are complaining about the size of this already gigantic meal, we are only giving more evidence to why America is so obese.#3 - You have to pay extra for guac. You have to pay extra for guac back home too, this is nothing new. Circle back to #1 about the rule of thumb pricing and all order is restored.Clearly, I love Chipotle. This trip was no different. My only complaint is that the rice wasn't cooked very well (a little hard) but I still thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Thanks for your great restaurant, Denver!",

What I like best is that you can get a \"bowl\" instead of a burrito, that's essentially all the rice, lettuce, meat, sour cream, salsa and cheese fully loaded into a bowl, sans the tortilla or wrap. It's frigging delicious. I took my old colleague on Wednesday and she agreed. I think my bowl was around about 550 cals (I looked it up online, what a loser) so actually not too bad for something which is fully fat loaded with cheese and sour cream. #greedy-people-of-the-world-on-a-diet-unite-and-rejoice :)",

Being North American, it was the very first place I scoped out when I moved to London and frequented it a lot at the beginning. The prices don't seem that much higher than other places but asking about \u00a31.50 for guacamole is nearly double other burrito joints in London. It's a great eat, huge portion and loaded with everything makes the perfect meal. The price compared to North American prices is more, and compared to other restaurants in London tends to be more. Honestly, I prefer other burritos over Chipotle burritos but don't get me wrong: I am a big fan of Chipotle. I only gave three stars based on price and because their guacamole isn't the best in London for approx. \u00a31.50 extra. That's outrageous for the little scoop you get. The choice of rice also puts me off a little bit, white cilantro rice or brown cilantro rice- boring. Overall, Chipotle is a great eat but not the best in London. I prefer Tortilla Mexican Grill- cheaper, better guac and Mexican rice as an option. I think their burritos are tastier than Chipotle, personally.",

    "text": "Chee-Pote-Leh is probably the closest phonetic pronunciation. Please don't pronounce it with a \"lay\" sound instead of \"leh\". Trust me on this. I almost avoided coming here because of all the negative reviews saying the taste would be disappointing, and I'm sooooo glad I didn't listen to all of the negative reviews below. Note: \u00a0The UK in general is very lacking in delicious authentic Mexican food, and thankfully they make up for it with the amazing Indian food I've tasted here. (Of course, the reason is because there aren't many Mexican immigrants coming to the UK and setting up shop.) Having said that, Chipotle is an Americanised Mexican chain, so while it might not be the same food you'll encounter in the eateries and street stalls of Mexico, it does a superlative job of providing fresh Mexican ingredients and food. As a native from Los Angeles (meaning LOADS of Mexican food growing up) living in England for the past 6 months, I've sorely missed Chipotle and I can definitely say eating here hit the spot! I am so particular with flavours, and while I admit the mild salsa is slightly different and the burrito didn't taste *exactly* the same, it still is probably the best burrito in the UK and you can still totally tell it is a Chipotle burrito. Burritos start at \u00a36.70~ for chicken and up to \u00a36.95~ for carnitas (shredded pork, crispy edges, soft meat- one of my favourite meats!), barbacoa (spicy shredded beef), and I forget the last one but I think it was just grilled beef. I believe the extra charge for guacamole is \u00a31.40 which I always bite the bullet for because me + guacamole are like two peas in a pod. 4 stars instead of 5 for the inflated London prices (change the \u00a3 to $ and you're not far off) and for *not quite* tasting as good as back home, but still would come back and eat here in a heartbeat.",

    "text": "As an American living in Britain, a Chipotle opening up around the corner was a welcome addition to my neighborhood. \u00a0Though my Mexican-food-cravings have dwindled due to the disappointing showing of most places claiming to serve it here, I popped in one day and it all came rushing back.First off, the staff in this place MUST all be saints, as I felt like I was at Starbucks with the diva-like orders that I was witnessing. \"I'd like some chicken, but not too much chicken, and no beans, cheese, sour cream or any of the other things. \u00a0Oh but I'd like some lettuce...a little bit more...[as she's paying] - can you actually add a bit more lettuce?\" \u00a0I think by the end, a few of the people who were ahead of me in line literally walked out with wrapped up lettuce. \u00a0The ingredients looked decent, though I'm fairly sure I got the dregs of the carnitas - shocking, since this was just prior to the lunch rush - I probably got yesterday's leftovers! \u00a0Anyways, the equivalent of about $15 later, I felt somewhat satisfied walking out with the weight of a small child in my shopping bag, stomach grumbling all the way home. \u00a0The rest is a bit of a blur, but all-in-all I am sad to say it was just OK. \u00a0The chips were stale (seriously?) and my burrito bowl lacked something, not able to put my finger on it - probably some kind of trans-fat/MSG/crack combo they manage to sneak in there at home.For Americans - this is not the Chipotle of the Americas. \u00a0If you're having a craving and there's nothing else, check it out for marginally good Mexican. \u00a0You'll be a welcome face in line as you say \"I'd like everything please\"For Brits - I know this type of food is not your strong suit, but if you do end up here, \u00a0try going all in. \u00a0You ruin the burrito experience by picking and choosing. \u00a0It's sort of a \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\" kind of experiment...or something like that...",

    "text": "Went to check out this new Chipotle that opened this week and was so happy! I actually like the UK version better than the US as it's a little healthier with the same flavors. Differences are there is a brown rice option in addition to the regular white rice with cilantro and the tortilla is a whole wheat blend. Another difference (probably due to cost) is carne asada is replaced with shredded beef. For those that have not been to a Chipotle, it's a great place for a quick bite. There is a bunch of fresh fillings to pick from and you basically tell them what you want to put into your burrito or taco and it's ready to eat and enjoy. Yum!!Side note: I have to admit I would not have given a Chipotle a 5-star rating in the US as there are so many other choices for mexican food there, but since moving to London it's been hard to find good mexican food like in California. I'm really pleased how they were able to deliver the same flavors in London.",

Chipotle burritos at home are huge, tasty and relatively inexpensive. They have lost some of their charm emigrating from across the pond.. The food did taste good but the portions are so small that it was just a tease. Here is a clue Chipotle, be a little more generous with your portions. The only authentically Mexican ting about this place was the bandito behind the cash register. I paid almost \u00a325 for two burritos and three tacos. I am happy to pay more for good food but these guys have got to up their game.",

It was near Baker Street station and with plentiful staff on hand, my burrito was quickly created from scratch. It's fast food but healthy.

No central kitchen, pre packaged, frozen stuff here.I had a bowl with the carnitas, brown rice, pinto beans, veggies, guacamole, sour cream and topped with cheese. I also supplemented this with the fine sauces from Tabasco - chipotle & green pepper.It was so yummy and felt extremely healthy too (not counting the cheese) The meat was soft & tender, vegetables were freshly cut, not wilted. Guacamole was all fresh. So yeah, if there's a chipotle in the vicinity, I'd definitely consider them for a quick lunch and if it's an early dinner it can even be paired with Mexican beer & maybe a margarita! #YelpEveryDamnDay",

    "text": "This chipotle isn't my favourite one in London. \u00a0Every time I get something here, there's something that doesn't go quite right.The first time, the people working were incredibly stingy! So much to the point where the flavours of all the ingredients weren't balanced and it wasn't very good tasting.The second time, I got a bowl and the same thing happened again. A lacklustre bowl of not enough balanced flavours...just a crap load of meat and puny servings of rice, salsas, cheese and lettuce.The third time, I got a burrito. \u00a0And finally I felt like I got the usual and proportional toppings I had hoped for...but the burrito was poorly wrapped and for some odd reason VERY LEAKY! \u00a0I had this as a take-away, and it was so embarrassing as I had to eat my burrito on top of the brown paper bag it came with. \u00a0Liquid somehow oozed through the tortilla, through the foil and \u00a0was thankfully caught into a pool/divot I made with the paper bag. \u00a0Towards the final 3rd of the burrito, it completely fell apart and I looked like a moron at my desk.Really don't know what to say. \u00a0I have had a semi-consistent experience with my meals here, and all of them were not as great as other chipotle locations. \u00a0I come here hoping for a great tex-mex fix...but I am often let down.I would recommend going to the Soho location as I find the food and service are much better.",

I knew Chiptole made quesadillas despite them not being on the menu so I was feeling like a major badass ordering from the secret menu. Well, next time I try to be cool I'll have a specific example to reference to dissuade me from even trying. The quesadilla was underdone, meaning the cheese was still in solid form, and the tortilla was soft and pale. I was busy so I didn't have the time to go up and get another one so I ate it, grimacing with every disappointing bite.And to add insult to injury, they charged me 70p for a side of sour cream which was genuinely filled with less than a tablespoon of insipid dairy liquid. Eat a d chipotle on baker street, eating a motherfucking d.",

Basically, you join the queue (there's always a queue in Chipotle) and then you just pick up all you want: meat, veggies, cheese, salsa...there're a lot of ingredients to choose! I always go for the chicken but everything looks amazing. They also have tortilla chips and guacamole if you feel like having something else (their guacamole is one of the best I've ever tried)I'll come back for sure. It's cheap, it's quick and it's so Yummy!!",

    "text": "Not sure about the reviews on here. My take is that the food quality is much higher than in the US, but this is outweighed by the higher price and small portions. + Better quality ingredients. Peppers are multicolored and the seasoning tastes better to me. + Chicken is a better cut. No tendons or inedible parts that you sometimes get in the US. - Price is more in \u00a3 than in $, meal ends up being close to double. - Portions are seriously laughable. You have to be uncomfortably aggressive with the employees to make sure you get a fair portion. I had to ask for extra cheese 3 times and I still only had half of what I would get in the US before I gave up. Overall, not bad for a quick fix of American \"fast food\" but leaves much to be desired.",

I have come here once specially for the burrito as its the closest Chipotle to me. The burrito was delicious and full flavoured. It was well made, full of flavour and they do not skimp on any of the ingredients at all. I know whenever I want a burrito fix, I will come here.",

The reason it's only 2 stars is because two members of staff were disciplining another member of staff at the table next to us.. in the middle of the restaurant! It wasn't subtle at all, the manager seemed to be shouting the company handbook at the poor girl. Do they not have a staffroom? It was extremely unprofessional, it's a cheap meal but they wouldn't do something like that McDonalds.",

A decided (North) American take on Mexican (street) food.I've managed to visit the Baker Street Chipotle 3 to 4 times since it's official opening, and I've been been met with smiles, amazingly cheery attitudes and helpful staff. (Star #1)The Vegetarian/Vegan options are limited, but that's to be expected. The black beans are veg-friendly (the brown beans have bacon fat), and the guacamole is definitely of good quality, tasty and always a welcome addition to my burrito! (Star #2)After hearing my American accent, the Gen. Mgr. of the shop talked to me for a good while, asking me to share my thoughts on the food. I gave her my feedback, which genuinely appreciated! I was excited to receive a complimentary meal, for my next visit! (Stars #3 and #4!!)This is a American food chain, selling Mexican influenced fare. That's a given. The amazing aspect of the Baker Street shop of Chipotle has higher stands than those I encountered in the States, re: welcoming customers, accommodating diets (veg*n), and seeking input from people in the neighborhood.Well done Chipotle.
