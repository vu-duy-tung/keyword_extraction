    "text": "Stumbled across this pizza place while looking for the Cotswold at Algate. First thing I noticed was the fire blazing in the stone oven. It is simply furnished with a long bar tables in the middle of the room with mixed assorted old school wooden bar stools for seating. My companion and I ordered the margherita and romana pizza. \u00a0Our pizza's came quickly in about 10 minutes or so. \u00a0There was olive oil, oregano and chilli flakes provided at the tables. \u00a0We sprinkled our pizza's with olive oil, oregano and chilli flakes and then took our first bite. \u00a0The pizza was delicious. \u00a0The crust was perfectly cooked, crunchy but slightly chewy at the same time. \u00a0There was just the right amount of tomato sauce and cheese on both pizzas. \u00a0 They were generous with the prosciutto on my romana pizza but it wasn't salty or too over powering. \u00a0We polished off both pizza in no time. \u00a0And decided to try one of their pizza alla cioccolata. \u00a0It took about 5 minutes or so to cook, and we were expecting a dessert pizza. But instead we got a circular dough pastry, that resembled a pretzel sprinkled with icing sugar and cocoa. So we were slightly puzzled but hopeful. So my partner took the first bite and was instantly won over. \u00a0Inside the pizza pastry was a warm \u00a0mixture of mascarpone and nutella...it was fantastic. I can say that this place was definitely a pleasant surprise. \u00a0We will definitely come back here for our pizza fix.",

I got the classic margarita for just \u00a33.95 and it was beautiful- thin crust, fresh tomato sauce and a generous amount of cheese, perfect.And then desert. A pizza dough ring stuffed with Nutella and marscapone. I worried they'd be stingy on the filling but no, Nutella oozed out along with the creamy marscapone in exactly the right proportions. The dough was crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside.I can't recommend this place more. Cheap, quick and high quality, a rare find in London.",

If you are, I promise you there is no reason to try this place. Ask me to direct you to some of the other actually good places around.First of all, this is like factory style pizza. It's essentially Chipotle for pizza. Chipotle might be good, but it's certainly not great quality, authentic 5-star Mexican cuisine. Pizza Union is not only unauthentic, it's actually not good. Really.The crust is fine - just fine. It's only uniqueness is that it has cornmeal on the bottom (which I actually happen to like and it gives it a nice flavor), but is certainly not authentic in any way. Everything else is just at best mediocre.The cheese - so mediocre. It's like store bought packaged cheese. Not fresh or flavorful. The sauce - such a bizarre combination of super acidic and sweet that it got to be way too much. And I say this as a person who loves tomatoes, loves pizza sauce, loves pasta sauce, loves marinara sauce, etc...The toppings - wow. Literally 3 tiny leaves of basil constitutes a topping.The flavors don't mesh, the ingredients aren't good quality, the service isn't pleasant at all, but yes, the price is super cheap.Don't even get me started on their unaccommodating substitution policy. Absolutely no reason to go here.",

    "text": "We went to Pizza Union, a fun and funky joint near Liverpool Street. As the name would suggest they specialise in pizza and the giant wood fired oven dominating the open plan kitchen indicates that they take their work seriously. The pizzas cook in minutes and their light crispy blistered crusts are maybe the best we've had outside Italy. It's a super speedy operation, you place your order at the counter, they give you a buzzer tthat vibrates when you need to pick up your pizza. Job done. We started with a bottle of Prosecco (\u00a315) which definitely whetted our appetite for the main event. Next followed gorgeous pizzas. The Calabria - an unusual combination of n'duja (spicy sausage) marscapone and rocket (\u00a35.95). I really enjoyed it, the contrast between the properlyspicy sausage, more like a paste, and the creamy marscapone. The Stagoni (\u00a36.50) a quartered pizza with four different toppings, cotto ham, pepperoni, mushrooms and artichokes. For those who have food intolerances they also do a gluten free base that I can vouche for. In our opinion, the best pizzas outside Italy we've had! Perfect thin crust and base. My only complaint is that the standard Shoreditch look (bare bricks, lots of glass) makes the restaurant cold and therefore the pizza goes cold quickly too. But save space for dessert for they do dough rings filled with Nutella and marscapone (\u00a32.95), that are things of beauty. You might feel dirty afterwards but whilst it lasts it's a joyous experience, biting into warm dough, feeling the Nutella squirt over your fingers. Go with someone who already loves you because this is not an attractive look (unless you have niche tastes...). Go, the pizzas are cheap and great, what more do you want?",

Really high ceilings as well.It's all self-service. Order at the counter and you get a buzzer which flashes when your pizza is ready. I believe all the pizzas were under \u00a36 and the one I had (Reine) was great. The only (tiny) gripe I have is that they only have 1 type of red/white wine and I didn't think it was that great but it was definitely decent for \u00a311.5 for the bottle.",

    "text": "Pizza is love, guys. Last week we decided to pay a visit to Pizza Union in Spitalfields, to get some cheesy, tomato-y, dough-y goodness and see how their 'Superfast' tagline holds up.SpeedUnlike your usual city restaurant, there are no waiters and waitresses to take your order or bring your food out. Instead, you order and pay at the counter then take a small piece of plastic that buzzes and flashes when your order's ready. And from ordering to recieving our pizzas, it took around 7 minutes. TasteWe ordered up a Vesuvio (pepperoni, green chillies, cracked chillis) and a Carne (beef, chicken, pepperoni, onions). Toppings were full of flavour and fresh-tasting. The fire-baked bases are VERY thin with a super crispy crust. Considering the speed and price of the pizza, the quality is actually very impressive. However, drinks-wise I'd avoid the house white as it's not that great - stick to beer or soft drinks. PriceThe prices at Pizza Union range from just \u00a33.95 for a Margherita up to a maximum of \u00a36.50 for ones with lots of toppings - which is excellent value for eating out. The rest of the menu is kept simple - with three variations of side salad (\u00a32.95-\u00a33.95) and three fillings for a warm dough ring dessert (\u00a32.95-\u00a33.95). Beer's from \u00a33 a bottle, and wine's from \u00a33.20 a glass. Total cost for two of the top end pizzas, a basic salad, garlic dip and two drinks was \u00a321.AtmosphereWith wooden tables, neon lights and exposed brickwork walls, Pizza Union Spitalfields definitely has a bit of a hip, 'Shoreditch-y' vibe - except it's actually pretty much slap-bang in the middle of the corporate, suit-filled city. Heading in on a Friday night, it was lively but not overcrowded and we managed to find a table easily enough.Pizza Union have got casual dining absolutely sorted - offering quality pizza at affordable prices. Perfect for a quick lunch if you're working in/visiting the city, or just a fun evening out with mutually skint friends.",

But to my surprise these were the main event, for between \u00a33-6.5. We came on a Tuesday night & thoroughly enjoyed it. The pizza was really amazing, really thin & crispy base, just how we like it. The flavours were lovely too, and they didn't skimp on the toppings. Nice chilli oil on the table which we drank, it was so delightful. Would definitely recommend this place!! Cheap drinks too and a nice ambiance. Will definitely be back.",

I know I said it already but a pizza for \u00a36.50 that have some taste, not easy to find in London right? So it's important to point it out (twice! ) Then, who does not get annoyed when the bill comes in, you know you have ordered something cheap and the big question comes in: we share the bill?! (Euuuhhh nope! Loll) anyway, no questions of that here! Everyone goes to the till, order what he wants and pays for his meal! Done! And finally the taste: nice choice of pizza that could suit everyone (veggie, tuna, pepperoni, chicken, cheese, etc) and even if I found the dough a bit too slim, the pizza was nice and cook on wooden fire so it give it a nice taste! They also have desserts. We tried the Nutella and mascarpone... To share because you will get fast too much of it but OMG, I do love Nutella and in a warm dough with the mascarpone, that was... Yummy (and fat sorry I have to say it :) So here you go, you want to spend some nice time with your friends but you (or your friend) don't want to spent too much money, just go there, this place would do the job!",

Though I am not a pizza fan, this place serves up a variety of great options in a trendy yet very casual atmosphere (order at the counter, grab a pager, and take a seat at a communal cafeteria-like table). A slightly longer wait during the busy times, so plan accordingly, but it's worth the patience and you can snack on small containers of nuts and olives while waiting. Outdoor seating is a wonderful option in the warmer months. Great ambiance, friendly staff, and you can get a hearty multi-course meal for under \u00a310.",

Well, they are, but thankfully Pizza Union has you covered for fast and cheap, 12 inchers right in the centre.Most of the pizzas are around 5.95 and although the ingredients are not inspired or very original, there are some interesting ones like the Calabria featuring mascarpone and Nduja spicy sausage. They have white pizza as well which can be a nice way to change things up.It's sharing bench seating and the drinks are as cheap and cheerful in the variety of the selection - couple beers and cheap wine. Really great for a group of friends when it's the end of the month and you're starting to use all the change you've been throwing into your bag / on your bedside table.",

With a range of 12 inch pizzas going for between \u00a35 and \u00a37, and glasses of wine for less than \u00a33, and in such a central location, you really can't go too for wrong. My favourite pizza would have to be the Formaggi which comes with a generous helping of several different cheeses - including blue cheese, so don't choose this if you're going to have a business meeting or a date - and the Manzo as the minced beef just tastes so good. It takes Pizza Union 3 minutes to make a pizza, and, to the best of my knowledge, they've usually been pretty quick even when the place has been packed. I've not been here at lunch time yet but there are signs which stipulate that customers are limited to four pizzas each during lunch so there is some crowd control going on there.If the pizza isn't enough to fill you up, you could opt for the nutella dessert pizza or a small tub of gelato to finish off. I'm usually full though so haven't had the chance to try them out despite my numerous visits here.",
