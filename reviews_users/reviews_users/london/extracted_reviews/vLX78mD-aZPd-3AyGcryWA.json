I have had to stop them from nabbing my not quite emptied cup several times.",

Coffee prices have crept upward in London this year, and this place is no exception. But I'll definitely be back if I'm in the neighborhood.",

Minimalist industrial (of course) setting with rows of coffee loversWe opted for a Flat White (more coffee, less milk) which comes out to the same price you pay back in the States, about $3 and some change. Sizes are smaller than in States though. Barista did a knock up job with our drink - warm to drink, creamy milk, and that lovely jack of spades house blend they have. Out of the coffee places we went to - Monmouth, Tap, Noble, and (er... one more I can't remember), this was our favorite. :)",

Ambience:Decor is the in-vogue-for-coffee-shops (and, to me, very appealing) industrial chic, and the wood-and-metal furnishings coupled with myriad skylights and windows make for a wonderful vibe. As other reviewers have mentioned, though, the big-open-space thing means that it can get a touch loud, and I'd be hesitant to come here with more than one other person.Coffee & Food:I got the filtered Rwandan Gihombo, and was pleasantly surprised at how sweet it was. Much mention has been made of the espresso, and I'd like to try that as well. Roast beef & horseradish sandwich was also delicious (get it toasted).Workability:There's free wifi and it's plenty fast, but there's a real dearth of power outlets for plugging in laptops and phones.",

Most are smashing coffees and eating something delicious from the abundant display of cakes, pastries, salads and sandwiches. Service is fast and friendly and the coffee is, for the most part, awesome. The espresso and milk based coffees I tried were excellent. But sadly the pour over I had on my second visit was average - the roast seemed too dark, the resulting brew flat and boring. Luckily everything else here (including the staff) are amazing.Coffee nerd tips:- They roast here on Tuesday's so pop in if you want to see the Probat in action. - They serve a light iced tea palate cleanser with the espresso, a trend I saw in a couple of places in London.",

Even in the winter I get their iced coffee (always with their syrup) and occasionally their amazing dessert, all of which are incredibly delicious. I've been here too many times to count and I can't stop coming back, especially to their Soho location.The atmosphere for the other two are similar, but it doesn't beat the Soho one. Firstly, Soho's has very reliable WIFI (Tottenham Court doesn't have WIFI, and Rathbone Place has but it's impossible to connect with). Even though Soho's more busy, I love this location because it's more homey and they make their coffees just right... in the other locations they might forget to put in the syrup. The staff are so friendly here and very easy to talk to.I love their wooden decor and their antique spoons, no two are the same. I love that my drink always comes in an old glass jar. And check out their bathroom because I just smile whenever I see their toilet brush in a Starbucks cup.Lastly, I love their loyalty cards. Whenever you get a coffee they stamp a man onto the bike, and once you get 6 biking men, you get a coffee for free. So always get that stamp!",

The coffee itself is lovely; dark, black and smooth. However, Tap is not just about coffee. It also offers lots of food options, both the ubiquitous London cake selection but also healthy looking salads which are a great lunchtime option. They remind me of the kind of thing that you might buy from Ottolenghi (in my view a good thing) - I wish you could get more food like this from other coffee shops in London.",

    "text": "Funny that they have a Starbucks cup to hold their toilet brush when Starbucks was a huge step forward in making businesses like this viable. Not only that, Starbucks roasts and sells tonnes and tonnes of coffee every week, providing farmers with income and long term supply stability. If you've ever been to origin you'll know Starbucks is one of the more active players in coffee farmer welfare and sustainability. A little shop like this isn't really helping anyone but themselves. So the intended trashing of a company such as Starbucks is really just a disservice to their own industry. But hope they're making lots of money while the farmers stay poor",

It's got the wooden (natural) benches and counter tops, the rustic, industrial lighting fixtures, and the bare ceiling. The whole package.It's a small space, but a relaxing one in a busy area of London, where you can hang out, sip coffee and people watch. I had my espresso (in cappuccino form), and to be honest, it was too bitter and sour, and didn't really hit a chord with me. On the other hand, I did have a great time sitting in the shop and watching people come and go.It's a great spot to meet up with a friend, but if you're solely looking for a quality drink, then maybe you need to try other places as well.",

    "text": "Very cute spot to meet friends for a cup of brew and/or lunch in Soho. The inside has a cozy feel- Lots of windows so good natural light (when the sun's out). Warning however, it gets really loud inside. So, if you're looking to have a nice catch up with friends, try to get those high booth seats instead of the tables. I felt like I was shouting and asking my friend to repeat nonstop. I had the green bean and mixed greens salad. It was good. Simple..just what I was expecting. Wasn't drowned and overtaken by oil. Ordered a long black as well (good tasting brew). I guess it's a UK thing, but simple black coffees (long black) here are tiny. In order to enjoy a nice cup of brew, you have to order a latte or something mixed with milk =/I liked how the cashier was knowledgeable about the different coffee beans. The packaging for the coffee beans were so cute too. A good gifter. The only thing she didn't know was the intensities...it'd be helpful to have it labeled somewhere on the bag. All in all, solid spot.",

The brownie was delicious and beautiful looking, but the affogato wasn't amazing. The ice-cream was to die for but their was too much coffee and it was so strong that it tasted a little burnt. I've been here before and would recommend the latter over the affogato any day. They also do an iced coffee, but I found that a little burnt in taste as well.Extra points awarded for this place having a toilet... essential for a shopping pit stop! Points taken off for the 'find your own seat' set up. It's always a bit of a drama, I hate when cafes aren't organised enough to do this for you.",

    "text": "Tap coffee was a brilliant find, completely stumbled upon this place but for me it's no a go to whenever I'm in the area. Just a few doors down on Wardour from Oxford St, Tap is very hip and trendy. No real signs outside just an old bicycle hanging above the door. Upon walking in, the coffee aromas hit you smack in the chops. Sweet and warming smells that will make this place an instant winner. First up there's a huge counter full of amazing looking breads, cakes and pastries. They also have a good amount of porridge with various options on offer. I got here about 9am on a weekday morning, aka prime caffeine time, and there was only two of us waiting, so pretty good. The drinks menu is posted on huge mirrors above the food counter, I went usual and black Americano. I quite like the set up in this place, loads of seating options at the back and a separate counter down the room for all the coffee making. If you're sitting in, grab a seat, take a cool playing card in a jar table number and the coffee will be right over. If not, wait at the makers pass and you're in.The place is a very cool hang out, perfect for a morning meeting or getting to a place to hammer out some laptop based work. Not even a minute after sitting, the coffee was over to me and it was very nice. Not as sweet as my other favourites, but certainly a good strong taste. There's also a very cool space right at the back of the cafe that brews its own coffee beans, very decent. Worth a pop in here, reckon I would be a regular if I worked / live closer. \"Tap\" it up...",

From the bicycle hanging on the shop front to not actually having a name and cups that held jam in their past lives. But Tap has the substance to match the snobbery. Great baristas who do great lattes, filter coffee and cold brews. Tap does the best ice latte I've had the privilege of tasting and I've admittedly enjoyed quite a few. There's no better place to hang out between 5-6pm on a Sunday (most coffee shops are closed by this time!)Granted this isn't the most holistic review as I've never eaten here. But if I wanted a coffee fix, this would definitely hit the spot. To top it all off, they put their toilet brush in a massive Starbucks mug. Hipsters.",
