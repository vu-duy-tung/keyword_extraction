    "text": "In my stay in London, I did not have too many authentic English food - - however, I had a few delicious and memorable meals. Flat iron was one of those meals. The concept is simple and fantastic, and the steak is very affordable. The menu only has steak, and you only select how you want the steak cooked. Next, you choose the sauce and sides to go with the steak. Finally, you get your food and enjoy! The kicker is that the knives to cut the steak are adorable mini butcher knives. Coupled with the homely decor, and you have yourself a cute date.My tip for any takers is to go early. There can be a long wait, and even at a relatively early time, \u00a0we still had to wait 40 minutes. Luckily, there are a few bars very close by, so passing time wasn't too difficult. If offered a chance to return to London, I would definitely come by again.",

Really affordable price too, for steak in the central part of london. I always wanted to try this place but was daunted by the long queues for a long time. Finally went with some friends and we arrived early (for dinner) so the wait was only a little more than half-hour. So all was good.Regrettably I am not giving it 5 stars because my friend's steak came a little more rare than mine even though we all ordered medium rare. Also, the salted popcorns were too salty.",

Their cut of meat obviously isn't the prime but at this price, you can pop in whenever you fancy a good steak.Small portion size but it's actually a good thing for greedy ladies who are trying to eat sensibly. Side dishes are also lovely and very reasonably priced. Their house red is perfectly drinkable too. I love it!",

Basically be prepared to sit close to people you don't know and on stool like seating fixed to the floor.They serve popcorn as soon as you sit down, ok.. different and the beers are nice and cold so.. sorted!The menu, to my knowledge, only had two steaks... we both had the Flat Iron steaks... really nice, how do I want it cooked?

I have it medium/rare, and often I am thinking this is a bit too bleeding and moo moo for my liking, or on the flip side, too well done, too chewy. Flat Iron really do get the medium/rare just right, and the menu is real simple.You can order your standard Flat Iron steak (usually \u00a310) or the special cut for the day (around \u00a315). Than your sides, choice of chips and various greens. Try out the Roast aubergine, tomato and basil. goes perfect with a forkfull of steak and chips. Sauces are your standard steak accompaniments such as Bearnaise, Horseradish cream, Peppercorn and Fred's sauce.. which has bit more of a kick.. They are all reasonably priced, so being the pig, or in this case, cow I am, I will have two, to myself ! Wines are simple to order as you can get it by the glass, carafe or bottle. I am usually too stuffed for dessert, so that will be left for my next time... maybe when I visit their Denmark Street branch.Oh yeah, you gotta go cos you get a mini cleaver in place of your knife !",

    "text": "This is an intimate restaurant on Beak St, which specialises in flat iron steak. From time to time, they also offer a special steak (when I was there, they were doing a NZ wagyu steak). They do nothing else except for the usual sides.I have a nice feeling about this place. I don't think you can make a booking, but you can pop in to register your name on a virtual queue. Be prepared for a long wait if you are a group. Obviously it is much easier to find space if there is one or two of you.I had the steak which they usually offer for \u00a310, done medium rare. This is what the lady recommended, so I thought I would delegate that decision to her. I got a side of chips (what else?) and the steak already comes with a token salad. I asked for horseradish too.It came out fairly quickly. This is a smooth operation. I like how the steak is already sliced into bite-sized morsels and I managed to eat the whole meal, casual-style, with fork in right hand, left hand on the table. Get some horseradish on the fork, spread it on the steak, place it on my mouth. I love it when the heat from the horseradish slowly permeates from your mouth up through your sinuses.I was pleased with the meal: it filled a hole in my stomach and was good value. The people there are friendly without seeming too rehearsed. I'll come back again, when I feel like a steak, but not the full-on experience of the bigger steak restaurants.",

And it's cheap, 10 pounds with a small salad.The ambiance is great and the staff are kind. The sides are very good, I always get the market vegetables. I also love the delicious buttery popcorn brought out for free with the menu.The steak is not well seared enough, however. Even for medium rare, a very good steakhouse can use high temperature to get a perfect sear. Flat Iron doesn't and definitely misses out on some flavor. If it was a 30 pound steak it'd be a big problem. For 10 pounds it doesn't merit a star deduction.",

It was 12pm). The ambience is very nice, your seat is equipped with a tiny meat cleaver (which you don't really need if you get the classic flat iron, as it comes already sliced) and tap lemony water is served without asking. There is a big board with the specials of the day - which nearly tempted me into trying the Wagyu Picanha (I drool if I as much as think about it). But alas, diet. And also I thought the first time I should really try their famous classic so I went for the flat iron steak. I also ordered a side of fennel & nectarine salad, never thought they could work together but it was so tasty!The steak itself came medium rare, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was actually medium rare! I could see the difference between my friend's steak which was just medium, and my other friend's steak that was rare-blue. So kudos to them for knowing their meat. (You'd think that's a prerogative for steak houses, unfortunately that isn't always the case...)We shared a bottle of wine and I've since been trying to remember the name of it as it was VERY good, and I don't usually drink red. It was light and tasty. Complimented the meat perfectly.Will definitely be back, hopefully NOT for dinner as I hear the queue can get quite intense (and I can see why!).",

I brought my friend here aiming to introduce to her one of my fav steak restaurants and ordered the flat iron steak (medium well). The steak turned out to be well-done with its surface already hardened. We signaled the waiter to change for us, but instead of understanding why we wanna change it, he rudely threw out the sentence \"I WILL CHANGE FOR YOU. HOW DO U WANT IT DONE\" to refuse any communication. His \"I am sorry\" seems super insincere and irritating for someone with high expectation of the service here. He's acting like 'as long as I can change it for you, what the fuck are you complaining about'. This is indeed the WORST dining service I've ever received in London. Totally not worth the money judging from the service and food quality (How can a steak house and its staff get confused with the difference between medium well and well done?! I just don't get it!). If u r looking for good steak in time, go somewhere else where they give u the right thing u order and some respect!",

However no word of a lie, 8 hungry lads after a few beers we had two rounds of steak-it was simply too small. So 2 steaks, a bottle of red between 4 and 2 potions of chips and sauces etc. came to \u00a340 which is not expensive for the heart if Soho. However the portions were simply too small if you want a decent steak. Nice enough for a one off, probably would recommend it and now I've done it I probably won't go back!

The place is fairly small, and there will be a wait even late night(we went there around 9pm?), however you can wait downstairs at the bar and they tend to have a happy hour deal anyways. The steak was done fairly well, and the fries they had here were probably the best I've had in London (most of the fries I had were soggy/reheated or old tasting). These fries tasted as if they were fresh from the fryer! They were nice and soft on the inside with a crispy outer. I would recommend this place for small group(ie. two pple), as it is fairly small and you'll share the table with others there.",

Walking distance from Piccadilly Circus, we got here about 6pm and waited for a table downstairs in the bar for about half an hour. Just in time for happy hour they have a great range of drinks and cocktails and serve their wine by the carafe. For food, they had a choice of their regular flat iron steak or special top side cut. My boyfriend and I ordered one of each, goose fat fries each, blue cheese and candy pecan salad, and baked aubergine with parmesan all to share. We got both steaks medium rare (recommended). The flat iron was great but personally the topside was a little overcooked but still good. Great atmosphere with a live band and shared seating arrangement. Staff were excellent and prices were really good, especially for area (about \u00a320 each including drinks and tip). Cannot wait to go back with some friends! Yum!!",

The steak was delicious and tender--it felt like a steal at \u00a310. \u00a0I ordered the steak medium-rare and it was perfectly cooked. \u00a0I also ordered the peppercorn sauce (\u00a31) on the side, at the recommendation of the waitress. \u00a0Definitely a great add! \u00a0The steak was a good size for me--it wasn't not huge, but it's a very good serving size and seemed very high quality. \u00a0It was really fun to eat it with the small cleaver knife. \u00a0I also appreciated that it was partially pre-cut (probably an effort on the restaurant's part to try and speed up turnover). \u00a0Each steak is served with a small side salad. Order fries on the side though--they're great to dip into the sauce! \u00a0 My husband and I visited Flat Iron for lunch around 1pm. \u00a0There was a 30-40 minute wait -- definitely a lot of fellow tourists. The restaurant texts you when your table is ready, which I personally prefer as it lets you wander a bit. \u00a0We went to stroll and stop in the shops on Carnaby Street. \u00a0We were seated in the basement, which was quite dark but well decorated. The seating was bench style (long table, but individual stool seats), we were seated in between two other parties on a bench made to fit six. \u00a0It was definitely uncomfortable to be seated that close to the folks on either side. As a New Yorker I understand though that to offer a meal for such a deal, you have to give some things up. \u00a0In this case, it was personal space. \u00a0There were definitely some tables that were better, but it seems to be luck of the draw where you end up. \u00a0After ordering we probably waited about 20-25 minutes for our steaks. \u00a0I was a little surprised it took that long given they have so few menu items, but it wasn't a large inconvenience. I've been to fancy steakhouses back in New York, but nothing compares to the value of the steak here. \u00a0I would definitely return to Flat Iron on future trips to London, but would probably aim to go at an off time to avoid the crowds and hopefully score a more comfortable table.",

We'd had a drink in the basement bar (opened just for us, what luck!) and were able to order food quickly, but unfortunately the service went downhill after that (inattentiveness).The burger was on as the 'special' so a friend and I went 50/50 on a steak and burger to maximise things to try.I'll say this plainly, ask for no salt on your steak. The meat tasted good, but only when I'd been able to get rid of all the sea-salt flakes liberally applied over it. The burger was also heavily salted, though I'm not sure whether in the patty (fried, thick, juicy, good) or the bearnaise sauce topping.Personal preferences on seasoning levels aside, the sides were of generally good quality (the vegetarian in the group went through a few...), with the creamed spinach being a personal highlight. The much vaunted chips, cooked in beef dripping, came out lukewarm initially but were exchanged for fresh, hot ones (once attention was given to us by the staff). Very acceptable for thin-cut fries, punching up there with Honest Burger's rosemary chips, but not quite beating them.For the price, not bad (there are others which do slightly better for slightly less), but definitely too much salt. Solid over all, but not special enough to be worth more than a 10/15 minute wait (which could see you hop in a cab to Sophie's Steakhouse in Covent for their pre-theatre set).",

    "text": "I was highly disappointed with the service at Flat Iron. First, the servers were not attentive at all. It was late afternoon on a Sunday and the place was not full. We saw the servers busy chatting around the counter not paying much attention to the tables.There were 7 in our group and we paid individually. One of us changed her mind and decided to pay by card after the card machine was brought back to the counter. The server had this 'very displeased' look on her face and acted very annoyed which made everyone in the group feel uncomfortable. She was also not particularly nice when she was taking the dishes from the table. The food was ok, but not amazing. As many others have said the portions are quite small. The price is not bad for the location but I don't think I am not going back again.",

We had a total of 3 orders of flatiron steaks with sides drinks and sauce and it just cost i around 50 pounds. What a deal. Only thing, you need to come here early and put your name and number down because the wait can be long. Up to 2 hours for 2 people from what I experienced. But it's ok, cause there are plenty of pubs around the corner to pass the time. And unless you reserve a group of 6. Don't expect to have your own table. Overall the staff were fast and friendly, the food excellent",

We gave them our contact (Americans - remember to +1 before giving your phone numbers) The system they use is pretty intuitive, you get to see what place in line you are and they message you when it's your turn. You get 10 minutes to get back to the restaurant for your table.The server was prompt, nothing special. The husband and I both ordered the steak medium rare - I added Fred's sauce (hot tomato sauce - has a bit of horseradish). We also had as sides the salad with the blue cheese and the creamed spinach. The steak had cooled off quite a bit by the time it arrived to our table, but the rest of the items were fine in temperature. The creamed spinach was a highlight for us. The spinach is very finely chopped up, making the experience of eating the creamed spinach less stringy!",

My most recent visit, I actually arrived in good time, but my date didn't so we had to go on the waiting list for a table. 5 minutes earlier and we would have had a table, but instead we spent half an hour in their funky basement bar. The drinks were well made but it got quite busy. Thankfully it wasn't rammed by the time we had to go upstairs and be seated. So for the uninitiated Flat iron generally only has one main course on the menu - Flat Iron steak at the price of \u00a310, pretty decent price in my opinion, especially when you get to the quality of the steak. Sides and sauces are extra, you've got the usual b\u00e9arnaise and peppercorn sauces and sides consist of chips, seasonal greens and an aubergine parmesan which you shouldn't pass up. They have specials but I've always gone for the steak, it's that good. Your cutlery comprises of a normal fork and the cutest little cleaver you've ever seen, with your steak served on a little chopping block.Our food came quickly and went down very well, we were offered dessert but didn't take them up on it, and we were quite full from the main meal. Service was good but the restaurant is a little cramped, if you want to be intimate, this isn't really the place to be but good as a date meal, it's good food, won't break the bank and you've got a bar downstairs or a myriad of other options for a drink afterwards. I asked about vegetarian dishes and apparently they do a larger version of the aubergine parm which, as it's the best side on the menu, may not be a bad thing!",

Decent steak for \u00a310? Unheard of! Till now. \u00a0 The seating is very cramped and you will become quite familiar with those sat around you but in some ways I like this as it has a very chilled out and unpretentious atmosphere. \u00a0 Obviously the steak is nice but the sides are actually really nice too. They had an aubergine tomato dish before that was gorgeous! I think you get great value here and as long as it's not over an hour wait it's well worth it as you can go and have a drink elsewhere and they'll tell you when to come back.",

    "text": "We were here in July for our honeymoon, and we weren't sure where to go eat. \u00a0So where else do you go and search for a great place to eat! \u00a0We went to this restaurant because of the rave reviews on Yelp. \u00a0We left pretty dissatisfied. First off, just like a previous poster stated, we waited for 1hr45min for our table, just to find out that 80% of the tables are free. \u00a0I think the wait is partly because there is only 1 waiter per floor and 1 bartender per floor. \u00a0Not sure how many floors there are. It was towards the end of the night, and the waitress had decidedly checked out for the day. \u00a0We overheard her and the bartender making plans for after all the customers left, which leads into the waitress' careless attitude for the night. \u00a0She didn't cover the house dinner specials at all. \u00a0We had to ask her after we had put the order in, and saw the chalk scribble on the blackboard wall, that there were offering specials that night. \u00a0Her response was: oh right!...She also forgot to tell us that they had ran out of dessert earlier. \u00a0We found out after we had decided to order desserts. \u00a0I generally don't like dessert, but decided to order the dessert because I was actually still hungry. (and I generally eat small portions) The steak was cooked very well, but it was a very small portion. \u00a0The sides were good as well, but again, I was not yet full. \u00a0Lastly, adding to our waitress' careless attitude, she charged an additional steak to our check. \u00a0To her credit, she did catch her mistake. \u00a0They had to void the previous charge and charged the corrected amount. \u00a0Tip to the restaurant: \u00a0If you're not playing music, the diners can hear what your wait staff are talking about. \u00a0Also, let your diners know ahead of time if you run out of your one and only dessert item. \u00a0I did mention that to our waitress as well before we left. \u00a0Lastly, maybe hire more wait staff so folks don't wait 1hr45min just to see that the restaurant is basically empty. \u00a0It sets a very bad impression from the start.",

So delicious, medium rare, with prominent beef flavor that I love. Tender shoulder cut of beef, which has slightly more bite/fibrous than rib eye. Sauces and sides cost extra. Didn't like creamed spinach but the fries were good. The space is small and dark, with communal wooden tables/stools - a bit cramped, but love it! Verdict: Delicious steak, great value. Quite busy at night with long waits! (went around 9pm)",

We had these with some bernaise & peppercorn sauces, the rightly popular creamed spinach & market greens (which were deliciously buttered kale) as well as the standard chips on the side.

    "text": "Sometimes, the picture is more satisfying than the food. As someone that was immensely excited to take a bite into the Instagrammable cut of steak, my overall experience was highly disappointed. Upon arrival at the place, my expectations of this fine establishment, were definitely well met. The beautiful interior and welcoming atmosphere, were just what \u00a0I had imagined. Their eye for detail in the cutlery for your steak made the experience so much better. It was however upon opening the menu, that my experience began to descend. As usual, I ordered the standard flat iron steak with a side of crips. Now, being brutally honest as I like to be. My expectations of course were of a beautiful piece of large steak to be perfectly seasoned right in front of me. I however, instead received, what could be the baby of my dream like steak. The truth is the unsalted piece of steak in front of me was definitely not worth the 10 pounds I paid. \u00a0The crips \u00a0on the other hand were perfectly crispy with a touch of fluffiness inside them. \u00a0As for the so called side salad, well it might have been easier to go Tesco and drown a couple of leaves in olive oil, because that is just what I got. Now while, my experience was not as expected. I would say in this case, you pay for the atmosphere and the curiosity to try a steak that is often seen on your feed. In total the meal came out to nearly 14 pounds and two hungry people.",

    "text": "My friend gave me a rave recommendation to this place and I was excited to try it, during my first night in London no less. We lined up and put our names down for a table, and were told the wait would be 45 min. That was fine, because we just went to a bar and waited for their text to let us know our table was ready. Be prepared for the wait. I ordered the steak with peppercorn sauce which came with a side salad. We also ordered fries to share. The good: steak was pretty on point and at such a great and affordable price (~\u00a310). I ordered mine medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. The peppercorn sauce was delicious. It reminded me of turkey gravy. You cannot lose with steak and turkey gravy. The side salad was pleasant- a nice little healthy touch to the otherwise caloric meal. The fries were good, nothing to really rave about. I thought the mini butcher knife (as the steak cutting knife) was a cute touch and I got a nice kick out of using it.Now the ugly: I began to realize the service they were giving us was not the same service given to the patrons sitting around us. Point #1: we were not given the free popcorn once we sat down, but the 2 guys who were seated right next to us (same table) received the cup of popcorn upon sitting without even asking. No, they were not regulars because Point #2: the waitress (same as ours) asked them if it was their first time there. They said yes, so she proceeded to explain in detail the daily specials. Er, 20 minutes earlier she literally just pointed at the chalkboard and told us \"those are the specials over there on the board.\" I didn't even know where the heck she was pointing at, and had to identify it on the wall myself after she left. Where was my detailed explanation, lady?! Point #3 which could really have been forgivable had point #1 & 2 not occurred, but she tried to take our plates away when it was obvious we still had fries left and still eating. The 2 girls next to us were chatting away with their glasses of water for 30 minutes (not exaggerating) without ANYONE attempting to shoo them off. I mean I was even holding a fry in my hand as she was asking if we were done.I don't know why our level of service was different from the others and I don't want to make any assumptions. I can only hope that someone there reads this and are more conscious of the seemingly small things. I'm giving this place 4 stars because the food was actually good and very reasonably priced.",

I chose the special of the day which was the wagyu burger with an hollandaise truffle sauce. Oh boy! It was SO YUMMY!! It is surely entering in my list of top 5 burgers I love the most! Our waitress was great and very friendly. She explained us about these special and that the burger I had might not be available next time I visit the restaurant \u00a0(sad face) They do have other locations and they would announce on Facebook where to find these specials. I also had the Fred's sauce which was a spicy tomato dip that was great too with my fries.The unique dessert available is a chocolate mousse and by mousse it is more like a chocolate Whipped cream with salt. It was good and although small in size, it was very filling.Overall, I had a great time and the meal awesome. What else would you ask for in London? ?",

    "text": "I've been wanting to come here for a while and finally got around to it, and I'm so happy I did!I came here with my partner who is a big lover of steaks. Upon arrival our names were promptly taken and went downstairs to wait. Be advised that it can be a struggle finding a seat downstairs as it's just so busy! We stood for most of the wait which was fine since we'd just been sitting for 2 hours at a show but you'll have to be ruthless if you're tired from a full day's walking. The cocktails at the bar were really nice though so it's not an unpleasant wait!Thankfully we got called early and were seated upstairs. Note if you're under probably 5 people you will be sharing a table with others. This wasn't a big deal until later when a second group was seated at our table who were mahoosively muscular. Good thing we were about to leave because I would have hated sitting with them for the whole meal! Flat Iron is definitely not for those who value their personal space.They put popcorn down at your table which tastes awesome and I wish we could have had more. The service was quite slow. We were visibly ready to order fairly quickly but had to wait quite a while for anyone to come to us. The server was very nice though and I can understand it being a bit disjointed considering how busy the restaurant is. And we didn't have to wait too long for our drinks and food once we ordered so it wasn't too bad.The steaks were cooked really well. Of course as we know, the steak is only a tenner each, and you get a nice portion. The sauces we tried were yum. The creamed spinach was lovely, and the chips were decent. They didn't have normal Sprite but they had rose lemonade, and this was a huge novel highlight to my meal. If you don't like floral things you'll be put off, but please, it's so strange and beautiful and pleasing to drink this stuff!Something that bothered me a bit was that they had small bowls of salt and pepper that you had to put your fingers in to pick up and sprinkle on your food. I like this idea and the sort of tactile experience, but it's not really the most hygienic, especially when it's being shared with people you don't know.Overall there were a couple things I had issues with but I would definitely bring a small group here again, probably not just one or two other people though. BIG parties!",

    "text": "So everyone are raving about Flat Iron and decided to go and find out myself.We arrive mid afternoon so the place was half empty. It also smelt funny... not the aroma of the steak or food in general, just stale smell like a market! The review recommended the Aubergine dish which my partner & I both loved it. The chips was ok. Our salads welted as it seems it's been swimming in its dressing all day. One thing my partner pointed out was that he doesn't understand why there are a bunch of sea salt sprinkled on the steak. He understands that if it's to season the steak whilst cooking it but it looks more like a garnish. He found the steak too salty and hence the steak is ruined. The chef should really give this option to the customers, to top up with more sea salt or not.Overall it didn't live up to the hype. \u00a0We are a bit of a \"steak\" snob, regardless of the price, so the quality of the steak in Flat Iron is average. But for \u00a310, I can't really complain too much. I think I'd rather pay a little more for a good flavoured steak.",

This is as much due to an Irish heritage that considers 'boiled' a food group, which means I have been subjected to some pieces of meat that have received the care and attention of a Ted Bundy-esque chef.The steaks are great - really well priced, fantastically-cooked and with sides that are of perfect sharing size. The fries and blue cheese salad are excellent.The staff are on hand to assist without fuss, and some great drinks on offer as well.Get involved fam.",

    "text": "Flat Iron currently seems to be on the radar as one of the trendy spots in Soho. As yet another no reservation place, expect at least about an hours wait. But whats great is the little bar in the lower ground floor where you can wait comfortably till your table is ready for you. They do only one thing- steak and that's all there is to it. Take it or leave. Vegetarians- don't even bother.How it works is- you choose your steak which is either the Flat iron or the Special. Then choose your sauce and sides. I got the peppermcorn and chips with my flat iron. Which was good- but nothing to write home about. My friend got the bernaise sause and the asparagus, which was probably the better call. The portions of the sauce are pretty generous so he dipped the asparagus in the bernaise which was yum! Tbh the food was good, but I have to admit given all the hype I was slightly underwhelmed.What I will rave about is the service. It was phenomenal. Everyone we interacted with was delightful. Which is great, because understandably at busy restaurants the service tends to slip. Right from the maitre d to the bartender to the waiter - everyone one was delightful, pleasant and really helpful. Price wise I was pretty impressed 20 pounds for a full meal with wine.The ambiance was pretty cool as well, with lots of fittings salvaged from an old printing press.Its really good place, definitely got that trendy Soho vibe, not overly expensive, but like I said, I wasn't entirely blown away by the food.",

You order your own sides and the steak comes with an amazing little salad that is all the steak really needs in my opinion. I actually love how this place has only one option when it comes to the protein (unless there is also a special). Also love how they made it affordable so everyone gets to try. Now the four instead of five stars is for the seating. I love the communal table thing but the stools are painful and made it hard to eat dinner with a baby (although waitresses were so friendly and sweet with the little one). Definitely wish there was an option I could go to in the US as a regular but will have to keep dreaming about this steak until I visit London again.",

There are some optional sides and sauces, but if you don't like steak - stay out. When I was there they had 2 additional specials, another type of steak and a burger. Not surprisingly - I opted for steak. The steaks are served on an iron slab sitting in a wooden tray. Surprisingly on both times, the iron slab was not hot, which was a let down. In addition, the steaks themselves were relatively cool when served. This indicates pre cooking, which is a let down.The steaks were good and tender and if they were only hot - would qualify as top steaks.The fries were good, although overly salted. The sauces were delicious and added to the experience.All in all, a good solid steak place that would really improve if they made the steaks fresh.",

There's a lovely little bar downstairs too, so if you are on a hot date & fancy turning it up a notch over cocktails & their delicious custard donuts in a dark corner then this is your place.",

We decided to come back on the last day of our family vacation and it was absolutely worth the hype. They were serving their wagyu steak special that day which we all ordered. First of all, the ambience for the place was really cozy, and we didn't mind being seated next to other people at all. The service was fantastic, with the server being extremely friendly and peppy. The steaks came out perfectly cooked at medium rare to all of our liking and was melt in your mouth tender. The portions were just right for the pricing at \u00a318 (if I'm remembering correctly) and everybody left satisfied. By far, during my entire trip through Europe, this restaurant stood out the most out of every restaurant, whether it was in Italy or France.

Pick your steak, sauce and sides and thats about it.My wife and I, we decided to try the Wagyu and the regular beef. We both ended up liking the regular steak more - so we decided to order another one (total: 3 orders of steak for 2). The sides were average comparing to others but we came here for the main dish and not the sides.I strongly recommend going early to get a seat. We actually got there a little bit before the main dinner rush and we had to wait about 30-40 minutes. By the time we actually sat down for dinner, the wait time was around 1 hour and 30 minutes for all the people coming in.The service was friendly and turned out one of the servers \"Elsa\" was from Santander, Spain - where I stayed for the summer as an exchange student. Small city in northern Spain. Go Santander!Anyways - back to topic. I would recommend people to check out this place. Just remember, you will have to wait if you decide to go during peak times.",

    "text": "Just two items on the menu?! A special and the flat iron?! How will I cope?! Having lived on this street and having seen the change from bar central to foodie paradise makes me regret I moved away. Flat iron is a place that is reminiscent of an amazing Hawker Centre stall in Singapore. It has queues for at least an hour at any point in the day and it only serves one or two things that it does extremely well. Usually a \u00a310 Flat Iron steak which is great value because it's from the shoulder and thus a little bit tougher than what you'd get from a Fillet Mignon or Sirloin cut. But Flat Iron seems to do it perfectly well and you'd never know the difference. The night I was there, the special was an Onglet grilled medium rare. With 4 in our party, you can essentially order everything (That's what we did -- \"Waiter, we want everything on the menu tonight!\") since the menu is quite small - but don't take that as a bad thing. Everything is amazing. We even had every single sauce on the menu, which made it a bit of a treat. The best sides I'd suggest are the Roast Aubergine and the Goat's Cheese Salad. The cream spinach isn't the best I've had, and it's not served very warm. The fries are good, but I've also had better. All in all, even though we did have everything on the menu and with one round of drinks, the total per head came to \u00a325, service included! That's really NOT a lot for as much food and fun as we've had. Be prepared to wait though, as I don't see this place ever succumbing to unpopularity. 4*s and DEFINITELY coming back again.",

However, the wait isn't always that long so don't let that detour you. \u00a0The actual steak itself is brilliant at it's standard of medium rare. Plus, it's relatively cheap at 10 pounds a steak! And although the steaks aren't the biggest in portion sizes, one steak is able to fill me up. The chips are so bloody good as well. I think it's because of the salt that they have. Definitely put salt on the chips as it just adds to the goodness of them!Overall I can't say enough good things about this place.

    "text": "After spending a long day work craving a steak I did a quick google of places near by that could potentially satisfy my hunger for beef. \u00a0Flat Iron 4 mins walk away. Sorted! Situated on Beak Street in soho this place is a cosy corner a few streets away from the hustle and bustle of Piccadilly \u00a0Circus. Their website is simple... a picture of their speciality 'Flat Iron Streak' and an option to join the mailing list. What you see is what you get.The restaurant is small with shared tables as it was originally a pop up restaurant but has stuck around due to its success. The menu is small which means you get served quick and the food is good. We had the Flat Iron steak, Sophie's salad (candied pines nuts were delish) and the dripping cooked chips. The meal was gorgeous and I really liked the relaxed intimate vibe in the place. This is not the best place for a vegetarian as salad is your only option. You can't make reservations so get there early or be prepared to wait.",

    "text": "I heard about Flat Iron and their famous 10 pounds Steak many times, my friends I finally gave it a try after some shopping in Soho as we passed by this location and the queue.They don't take reservations, same as many causal restaurants in London. Be aware of some wait time to eat around London town in Zone 1 (city center) if you are just visiting and not familiar with the local food scene. The restaurant has two levels, it's not small but definitely crowded. Tables are quite close to one another, they play hit songs in the background with a causal and friendly hipster vibe. That's how I would describe it. \u00a0The menu is very simple. The One & Only main item is The iron steak. You might choose \u00a0sides and sauce. It comes with a side salad. We liked the fries, creamy spinach, and the horseradish and also peppercorn sauce to accompany the steak. Oh, and not to mention, the meal comes with a cup of warm buttery popcorn .I am also a sucker on presentation of the food. The little cleaver is a cute touch ! You can purchase it as you wish as well For the quality and the price, you really cannot go wrong here! I would say my experience matched up with the hype!*** If you are a foodie like me, follow my IG at \u00a0 \u00a0 @running_muffin \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0for more recommendation around the world !! :) ***",

    "text": "Came to Flat Iron after reading reviews that it's a must go when visiting London which after dining here I think is a major exaggeration. Service: Expect the place to be packed on a Saturday afternoon, waited about 45 mins. They asked for your phone number to text you when your table is ready but for some reason we never received a text so we had to keep stopping back to check with the hostess. Staff was pretty nice and the waiter explained the menu well for first timers. Food: I must say I was a little disappointed in the steak, but then again for \u00a310 I guess you can't expect top notch steak. I do get that the cut of steak used isn't the absolute best, but I thought they would make up for that with the flavor but it was very lackluster for me at least. But Flat Iron's saving grace was their side dishes. I found the creamed spinach and eggplant dishes really good and my favorite part of the meal (which bumped them up a star). The drinks weren't bad either but nothing memorable. Overall, although I thought the simplistic menu and mini butcher knife utensils are cool, I don't think I would come back here. It's one of those places that you go at least once just to say you've eaten there.",

They do have various sides to choose from as well, which were delicious. We ordered two steaks, a side of cabbage, french fries, and a salad to share. My favorite part of the meal was all of the dipping sauces to choose from for the steak (I'm a sauce girl). I went with the peppercorn sauce and it was flavorful and creamy, and even paired well with my french fries.I recommend this place for a casual & inexpensive dinner and hope to be back soon!",

This place is dedicated to perfect each item on its small menu so whatever you choose will be great.It is fairly priced so you can expect to pay around 25\u00a3 per person for a steak, salad, add-on dressing and a beer.The setting is nice, the location is small and the quality/price ratio make this place a popular hot spot. At lunchtime, it can take 40 to 70 minutes before you get seated. So, don't arrive at the restaurant very hungry as you will have to wait for a while before the first juicy bite of meat makes it's way to your tastebuds.At the door, I provided my international phone# to be notified when a table would become available. In the meantime I went shopping to the nearby stores on Oxford Rd.Enjoy!",

Luckily the steak is sliced on the bias already and was fairly easy to cut.I can also recommend the creamed spinach, as many others have. It was tasty and not too heavy.If you're a fan of beef, and don't feel like dropping \u00a335 on a steak, the Flat Iron is an excellent choice to satisfy your protein cravings.",

    "text": "We chose Flat Iron in SoHo for our date night dinner while visiting London. They do not take reservations but when we arrived it was only a 10-15 minute wait for 2 people but I could see it being much longer for larger parties. The restaurant is quite quaint but that may lend to longer wait times. We both ordered the flat Iron. I had the peppercorn sauce (YUM!) and my husband had the bearnaise sauce, which he loved as well. The steaks came out perfect at medium rare which was suggested. We also ordered the creamed spinach, which was delightful and had a great texture. The star of the show, however, was the dripping fries. Y'all. These were the best fries I have ever eaten in my life. They were perfectly crispy and had the best flavor. I could have eaten my weight in these fries! The ambiance was wonderful (although a little hip and I am pretty sure we may not have been cool enough ha ha), the prices were more than fair and the food was delicious! A definitely go to!",

I definitely recommend adding a side of creamed spinach and a glass of red wine to go with the meal. It was a very satisfying and delicious meal. I was stuffed but very happy about it.The basement feels dark and at times warm, but it's a different atmosphere and quite hip.Best to come during off meal hours to grab a spot or dine solo for a likely guaranteed spot!",

    "text": "\u00a310 for a steak? Yea please. This is one of the must visit London places you're always hearing about, simply because it's some fantastic value for money. I visited the new Covent garden outlet and was seated within 10minutes. You get exactly what you come for: a tasty, juicy flat iron cut steak \u00a0that leaves you satisfied but not too full. Not to mention, they even threw in a free ice cream! One of the coolest things about flat iron has to be their knives, which are specially designed and shaped like tiny cleavers. You'll never actually have to use them since they already cut the steak up for you nicely, but still, it's a very nice aesthetic touch to add on to the whole meaty atmosphere. If you're craving a steak at the end of the month, this is the place to go.",

I had the classic Flat Iron Steak with a side of chips (French fries), Classic Peppercorn dipping sauce and a Rose Lemonade. All were delicious, The steak comes with a small (delicious) salad served in a cup. The total meal price was about \u00a318 after tax and gratuity. The reason this isn't quite a 5 star experience is simply because within the \u00a0vicinity of Flat Iron, there are a handful of equally tasty and exceptional restaurants at a cheaper price. However that being said, if you are craving a delicious steak with a delicious dipping sauce and the oh so tasty Rose Lemonade, this is your spot!",

    "text": "It was a long wait for a table at Flat Iron. We missed our table because not all our party had arrived. But was advise to let them know when all party arrived and we would be in the queue for the next table - which we did. But it looks like they had forgotten our table as saw a table of six being given to another group. \u00a0May be they thought we were too comfortable in their bar downstairs. But we was hungry and they sold out of the savoury small plate served at the bar!Once we finally got a table upstairs, it was a sign of relief! The restaurant has three floors - downstairs is what is a bar area which could be used for dining. Then two floors which are seatings for dining.Although the special of the day was tempting I decided to go with their speciality - flat iron. You get to choose how you like your steak to be cooked. I asked the staff to advice and said medium rare was the best way to serve the flat iron, so went with the reconmendation. I was not disappointed it was a beautifully cooked flat iron and the steak was nice and tender. It did get slightly salted at time due to the sprinkle of flake salt. But it makes a different that you dont really need any sauce.Although we the flat iron come with some simple salad (that was over seasoned with vinger), we also ordered some sides to share. My favourite has to be the spinach and the baked aubergine.The presentation of the food is rustic and cool. The steak served on an iron board and the knief os a mini chopper knief. Also the price is really resonable for a steak. I will be returning (depending on the waiting time)!",

The house flat iron steak is tender and full of flavour and you can get a selection of sauces - I got peppercorn and my girlfriend got bernaise - both really tasty.I had a small carafe of house red wine which was delicious and went with the steak perfectly.Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Somewhat of a letdown. Came here with my mom and we both ordered the flat iron steak cooked MEDIUM, dripping chips, and peppercorn sauce. I was really excited to try this place, reading the reviews made my mouth water.When the steaks came, mine was well done (cooked throughout with no pink at all) and my mom's was rare, red and bloody. We felt bad sending them back (something I almost never do) but both were not really edible to our preferences. Waitress was a little snooty about it but brought us two new ones, and these were actually both cooked to medium (hopefully with no spit for sending our previous ones back).The steak was fine but honestly nothing special. It could've used more salt sprinkled on top but for only 10 pounds, it was a good steak. No where near the best steak I've ever had, but better than any steak you can get in that price range at lowly diners elsewhere. The peppercorn sauce was fine, but if the steak was truly great, I wouldn't have needed the sauce to make up for some lack of flavor and add moisture. The dripping chips were also unremarkable. I appreciate that they were fresh and hot, but they tasted more or less like regular old fries.Overall, even when I got the steak cooked to my desired temperature, it was nothing to write home about. The only positive aspect is the affordable price - if it was priced higher, I probably would've given two stars. I was also glad I didn't have to wait long (came in at 5pm on a Saturday evening and only had to wait about 5 minutes), I would've been extremely disappointed if I had to wait a long time. Maybe next time, I'll try the ribeye.",

    "text": "Lovely place located in the soho area, excellent, soft steak for 11\u00a3 flat iron and 16 for ribeye what else can you ask for?If you want a nicely done steak, then this is the place to be, not too expensive and you get to choose if you want to have ur sides or omit it completely. I would say their french fries were really good... The steak comes with a complimentary sides salad already.Portion of the steak is acceptable in London, but would be a bit too small coming from someone who is here vacationing from at least the USA or Canada, however, it is delicious. Pair with peppercorn sauce and you won't regret it!. I also ordered a side of green beans, which I ask the server to bath it in butter, salt n pepper! Very fresh n nicely cooked as well. The mood in the restaurant is good and the best part of it? They got A/C therefore, that's a +++++. I would definitely recommend this place!",

I got the lean steak along with the Creamed Spinach side and the Peppercorn sauce. I don't like spinach in general but the way they made it here (with cheese I think, or some cream sauce) was absolutely delicious! Steak was juicy and great quality as well. The sauce enhanced it, though by itself the steak was very tasty too. Will definitely be back!! :)",

    "text": "You know a spot is good when they specialize in a one-item menu: The Flat Iron Steak (\u00a311.00) with a house leaf salad side. Of course you also get a couple sides you can add on, which we did as well. We opted for the Dripping Chips Batch #128 (\u00a33.50) and Creamed Spinach (\u00a33.00). Both were delicious with the creaminess of the spinach and the crispiness of the chips making perfect companions to the steak. Don't forget to add on sauce for the steak as we both chose the Peppercorn sauce for an extra \u00a31.00 --yum!I loved the presentation with the steak spread and even a cute, little cleaver although you don't even need since the steak is pre-cut for you. The medium rare came out perfectly pink on the inside for a delicious piece of meat. I was so happy that this was my first meal in London! The side salad was refreshing, but came in stocks of leafy greens that I found interesting. To pair with the entire meal, I had a Passion Fruit Fizz (\u00a33.00). It was a bit on the sour side, but so authentic to the passion fruit flavor with a sliced of real passion fruit in my drink! Flat Iron is a must in London, for sure!P.S. They also have a downstairs dining area and restroom below, so don't be fooled by how tiny the restaurant may seem.",

The restaurant already has two levels ~ so it's not exactly small. The menu is very simple ~ one main item: their iron steak. After, there are like five sides you can choose from, four sauces, and either yes or no for their dessert. As well, they do offer daily specials and a drink list. Next thing I want to mention is that their service here was awesome. Servers were friendly, happy, and knowledgeable. Food was very delicious and made on point. I highly recommend their fries, creamy spinach, and their horseradish sauce to accompany the steak. It was very reasonable and worth every penny. I am also a sucker on presentation of the food. So I was very impressed and definitely would recommend to family and friends. Just writing this review, its making me plan my next visit here already. So while you're reading this review, I suggest you to start making your way over before the line begins!",

What a wonderful surprise this was. \u00a0I was in the mood for Fish & Chips so my boyfriend and I wandered around Carnaby looking for a pub that was still serving. \u00a0There was only one and Michael decided he didn't like the attitude of the bartender or how she poured drinks and we could not stay. So we started wandering and happened upon Flat Iron. \u00a0We were just looking at the menu when the host popped out and said we could be seated in 5 minutes if we would like. \u00a0Michael, being the foodie that he is, was very intrigued by the fact the menu was so small. \u00a0I was still in the mood for fish so a bit disappointed to be going for steak but I am SO GLAD I didn't speak up about it. \u00a0This place is soooooo good. The ambience is great, the music is spot on and the staff is so friendly. \u00a0I'm also a popcorn fanatic (eating some now as I write this, to be honest) and I loved that there was a mug of it waiting for me when I sat down. \u00a0I had the flat iron with the peppercorn sauce and it just melted in my mouth. \u00a0I felt bad actually because it didn't even need the sauce, but the sauce was also so good that I couldn't not eat it! \u00a0They had a special burger that night so Michael got the burger with Bernaise sauce so we could each try something different and we also had the dripping chips. \u00a0Every bite we had was better than the first. \u00a0We had a lot of great meals while we were gone but this is the one we have discussed the most since returning. \u00a0Also LOVED the meat cleavers. \u00a0We bought a set to take home :) Michael is not a huge fan of London but I know dining here will soften the blow next time we come back!",

    "text": "Flat Iron: so many good reviews and on a couple of lists as a \"Not to be missed\" place. As a result, it was a no-brainer to add Flat Iron to my list of London places to try. Unfortunately, experience fell extremely flat and did not make the long wait worthwhile.We came on a weekday night, late evening. There was already a wait, but we knew upfront so we were prepared for it. We waited over an hour, despite coming pretty late at night to avoid the usual dinner rush. They take your number to text you when your table is ready. One thing I noticed while waiting was their inconsistent treatment of customers. Some customers were allowed to wait inside, away from the cold, and when they were seated and inside was clear, they didn't allow other people to wait inside either, despite allowing people earlier. As I said, inconsistent.Once we were called in and seated, everything went downhill rather than up. They have a limited amount of servers. At first it seemed like only one server was working, because no one else came to us to take our orders. Apparently they don't take orders in which tables are seated or when customers are ready. We came in first out of 3 tables that were seated and we were the last to get our orders placed. I guess due to their popularity and limited space, they will seat multiple parties at one table, which is what happened to us. They seated us with another party of two and those two got better attention and service. \u00a0The menu is super basic: only one steak (\u00a310), 3 sides (\u00a32.5 - \u00a33), 2 salads (\u00a33.5), and 1 dessert (\u00a32.5). Sauce for the steak is \u00a31. The daily special, which has stayed consistent, is the New Zealand wagyu and it is only available medium rare. We picked their \u00a310 steak, cooked medium, and the daily special plus some sides. Since there is a 100% chance you're ordering steak here, the utensils set out include a fork and mini butcher knife. They have popcorn in place of table bread. True to how the evening was going to be the rest of the night, our order did not come out right. When the steaks arrived, the flat iron steak that we ordered medium came out rarer than the wagyu, which was automatically medium rare. In fact, it wasn't even clear which steak was which when the server put down our orders because he didn't say what each steak was and he put the wrong sauces with the wrong steak. He put the flat iron sauce we ordered with the wagyu, even though he suggested it with the flat iron. There was not much service either. They cleared empty plates and asked if anyone wanted anything else at OTHER tables without anyone asking, but we had to fight hard to flag someone down to get the same level of service.I'm not a fan of things where you are automatically opted in and have to manually opt out. The optional charity donation is automatically added on bill, even though it is labeled as \"optional.\" If it's optional, should it be up to the customer to ask to have it added on? That's what frustrates me in the States. We have these charities that come by neighborhoods and leave a flyer in your mailbox telling you that unless you tape the flyer to your curb, they will automatically come by and paint your curb and collect a mandatory donation from you for the unsolicited services. They automatically add you for a service unless you take the effort to opt out. The optional donation completely reminds me of that.Some other random things experienced: there is also an optional 12.5% discretionary service charge on the bill. They can't break change without someone else using the register to ring up a bill in cash.At the end of the night, I couldn't wait for the meal to be over. Despite the great price for the steak, the other aspects of this experience at Flat Iron felt like such a waste of my precious time in London. I did not return on my second visit to London the following year and I have no plans to ever return.",

She's from Lisbon, and coincidentally by the end of dinner the parties seated next to us and behind us were from also from Portugal. That being said, dinner starts off with popcorn. The menu is very limited, but if you want flat iron steak, the menus PERFECT. We ordered two flat irons, that's served with small salads. We also order fries and the creamy horseradish sauce. The steak was really tasty and tender. For dessert we ordered the one dessert on the menu - a mousse with salty caramel sauce. The mouse is pumped into your dessert cup at your table and served with do-it-yourself salt. Excellent. And prices can't be beat. No wonder this place is always packed!",

The steak is really the best part, I don't think the sides were out of this world, especially not for the price. The menu doesn't have many options either - just not be best bang for your buck",

Fries:Surprisingly the weakest point of the dinner. \u00a0They did not taste good at all.. My hunch is that they used old oil to cook our fries since we were one of the last customers that night. \u00a0Also they weren't well-seasoned but we have no point of reference for British fries, maybe that is normal?The service was fantastic, our waiter was very welcoming and kind. \u00a0We can tell why this place is so successful. \u00a0Overall, we had a fantastic experience!",

    "text": "I write this review with mixed feelings. I dined here almost a year ago to the date and everything was amazing. So much so that I've wanted to come back ever since. And so on my most recent trip to London, after a 45 minute wait I was seated and eagerly awaiting my steak. Unfortunately this time round I found the steak to be chewy, some pieces were too chewy to even eat and I was so disappointed. On top of that, everything seemed over salty which wasn't very enjoyable either.However I must say, our servers were very lovely. My friend and I ordered the dessert to share which is basically a chocolate mousse that is actually prepared in front of you out of a whipping cream canister. I may be wrong but I think she gave us an extra big portion as she knew we were sharing :-)Anyways, I wouldn't not recommend Flat Iron. At \u00a310 a go not every steak is going to be perfect and maybe yours will be!",

    "text": "Hands down, the best meal that I had throughout my weeklong stay in London.I actually found out about Flat Iron through one of the accounts I was following on Instagram. I saw steak for 10 pounds and I was immediately sold. So three of my friends and I made our way over for dinner on a Monday night at around 6. They don't take reservations, and the place is super small, so we were told that the wait would be an hour and a half. That was fine because they took our number and said they'd text us when our table was ready. Plus, we weren't that hungry anyway. The tables are a bit like cafeteria-style seating. Aside from two round tables in the back, there's probably about 4 of them, which seats 6 each and yes, you will likely be sharing the table with randos.The menu is simple. There are a few sides you can order but as for the steak, there's only one option, which is their 'Flat Iron' steak. It comes with a side salad. Order the doneness to exactly how you would like it. Flat Iron is on point. I ordered a medium-rare and it came out exactly as that. The size is a good portion. I could have used a little bit more but then again, I can always use more steak. I left feeling satisfied - definitely get a side to share.I'd also would recommend the Spicy Italian Negroamaro. It tasted really smooth and of course, paired well with the steak.For the quality and the price, you really cannot go wrong here. You would definitely not find a place like this in NYC - it would be double the price, at least. If I ever come back to London, I will definitely make it a point to come back to Flat Iron.",

When a restaurant has few items on the menu, you can only hope what they do make is the best. With Flat Iron, they make only the best. The flat iron steak was rich with flavor and melted in my mouth with every bite. I had a side of Peppercorn sauce that was also delicious, but honestly the steak is so good on it's own you really don't need any sauce to add flavor. Service was quick and friendly and this has become my favorite restaurant I've eaten at while visiting London.",

I know, it's a low blow in light of the recent horsemeat scandal but \u00a310 for steak in London is UNHEARD of. My friend and I came in and put our name on the waitlist and we were quoted that it would be an hour wait. They were right. We came back right on time and were seated shortly after. There's only one thing on the menu and that's a flat iron steak. I ordered mine medium and added a salad and peppercorn sauce on the side. The flat iron steak was good, although I wished I ordered mine medium rare like my friend did. I thought his was a little better. That peppercorn sauce though... OMG it's mouth-watering good. I also tried Fred's sauce which has a bit of a kick, but the peppercorn came out as the clear winner in my book.Get your booty to Flat Iron, put your name on the list, and get ready to enjoy a \u00a310 steak next to a bunch of people you don't know.",

We also had asparagus as a side which went down a treat. The only thing was, I needed more food because it was so good!! One word of advice, the Fred spicy sauce for the steak we were recommend was not as good. I'd stick to the regular sauces.If you've not been, head over and enjoy a good quality steak for \u00a310",

    "text": "I love nothing more than a big, juicy steak, so when I recently met my parents in London for a bite to eat I knew straight where to head.Flat Iron, on Beak Street in Soho, is a one-dish concept restaurant with steak as its speciality. Diners can chose between the name sake option, a \u00a310 Flat Iron steak with salad (which is incredibly good value) or opt for one of the daily specials. Feeling rather ravenous, my step-dad and I opted for one of the specials of the night - a glorious piece of rare rib eye steak for two the share. \u00a0My mum went for the speciality flat iron and we ordered dripping cooked fries, aubergines roasted with parmesan, tomato and basil and creamed spinach to be shared amongst us. I also opted for a b\u00e9arnaise sauce to go with my steak - I'm addicted to the stuff!One of my favourite things about Flat Iron was the communial eating space, we shared a long bench with three guys who were having a university reunion - they roped up us in on horror stories of their antics and the trouble which they'd got themselves into over the years. We also shared favourite restaurants and they suggested Baltic be added as the next on our go-to list.They don't take bookings, but you can pop your name on a list and head to the basement for a few drinks whilst you wait as we did - I recommend the strawberry and basil collins. Flat Iron are a social bunch so keep an eye on their twitter to find out more about the daily specials",

This alone as a concept I think could make millions. Just me?I enjoyed the perfect pairing of a rhubarb and custard hot doughnut with a super old fashioned a great end to any evening.",

    "text": "By far my favourite place for steak in London so far, love the atmosphere, love the food and love the cocktails!!You cannot book for this restaurant so you may have a bit of a wait, would advise going a bit earlier than planned to avoid eating too late! I have been a couple of times now, the first time, we went at the busiest time, and had a 40 min wait, but it was definitely worth the wait! We were given a buzzer and waited downstairs in the underground bar, which has a great atmosphere, quirky basement style, with delicious cocktails! Back in the restaurant you're given a little bucket of popcorn while your waiting for your food, which is tasty and a bit different from your standard bread basket. There isn't much choice on the menu, but what they do serve is delicious, the flat iron steak is served pre cut, its just SO juicy and melts in the mouth!! Would recommend the dripping cooked chips and creamed spinach as sides, both very yummy! And my absolute favourite is the b\u00e9arnaise sauce, served in a little jug so you can have just the right amount! Before you leave, you may also want to pop down to the underground bar as they serve, delicious warm doughnuts with a passion fruit curd, perfect for afters if you're still hungry!!Lastly, the only downside for me is despite the good atmosphere, it is communal seating on benches, which i personally find makes my back hurt, but thats just me, no one else seems to have a problem with it!!",

    "text": "Had a great night at Flat Iron.Firstly, throughout the night all members of the staff were so incredibly pleasant, they were great. We (ok, my friend, I was late as usual) got there about 1830 and were told it would be 15-20 minutes for a table. It was longer than that but we didn't care because the basement bar is a really pleasant place to wait as opposed to the street which is your fate at Meat Liquour, Pitt Cue Co et al. There's actually space to sit down and you can watch the bar staff struggle with the giant block of ice they chip bits off. The restaurant itself is pretty cramped, we were seated in between 2 couples on dates which was pretty funny as my friend and I were much more relaxed (and dancing in our chairs...the music was awesome). The steak was very good and as I had inadvertently had a very late lunch I didn't have the problems with portion size that a couple of other reviewers mentioned! The chips also went down well, as well as the aubergine side which was a nice unusual pairing with steak. I went for the peppercorn sauce but would recommend Fred's sauce, which was a delicious concoction somewhat reminiscent of a Bloody Mary, I suspect Tabasco is involved.I think what sealed the deal for me with Flat Iron was the \u00a32.50 doughnut we had for dessert downstairs back in the bar. Yes, that is pretty expensive for a doughnut but we got to watch it be pumped with rhubarb custard filling (you can specify how many pumps) and overall I liked the concept. I think that's what I took away from Flat Iron in general - maybe not totally outstanding food in all honesty but I like the concept, I like their attitude and I hope they do well.",

A Monday night dinner in Carnaby warranted steak, a friend of mine made the call and we agreed to meet around 6pm at the restaurant. So the 1st thing to note is they don't take reservations, the 2nd is they won't seat you until your group have all arrived. If you are stuck waiting go to their basement bar, they have a happy hour 2 for 1 deal that is very worthwhile.To the steak, as per the name....flat iron! They also do a cut of the day but we all went flat iron. For your \u00a310 you get steak and a small green salad all other sides are extra. We went for beef drilling chips, aubergine roast and French beans. All delicious.The steak is cared for, seasoned and cooked to perfection. They really know what they are doing! I love it and I will be back! Flat Iron is Highly Jd Recommended!",

    "text": "It's been a while since I went to Flat Iron but I find myself recommending it to my friends time and time again.I knew of it's reputation before my visit so after having a drink with my friend on Old Compton Street we made our way over an hour before we wanted to eat in anticipation of queues (even though it was a Wednesday at 6pm).The place was much smaller than I had pictured in my head, but we took our buzzing table alert thingymabob and descended into the basement bar. The cocktails were well made and strong. The price was typical of the area but a step up after the happy hour offers nearby. I liked the sound of the bar food they had on offer too but decided to forgo them to save room for the main event. After about 45 mins our gizmo started to flash so we went up to our table. Again, I was surprised at just how small the place is. We were wedged between two rather gregarious couples and only at this point did I realise how restricted the menu is. You could have a flat iron steak (which they say is cooked medium-rare unless you would prefer otherwise). The special was a burger. Then there were a handful of sides.My friend and I both ordered the steak, naturally, along with a side of chips and spinach and at this point you see why it's so popular. The steak isn't a big cut but it is juicy, seasoned well and just generally tasty. It's also extremely good value.Why the missing star? I've had even better steaks for even cheaper in London (albeit out in Mile End) and I don't like it when I can't reserve a table and therefore have to wait for something like 45 mins.",

Yes, it's inexpensive at \u00a310 but the portions are almost comically small. That said, the steak is good and was properly cooked to my asking.Service was \"awkward\" ... unclear if thats because the wait staff was new, but our waitress was hard to understand and we constantly had to ask her to repeat even the most basic of items, which is odd considering only steak is on the menu. Agree with Tristan that the sides (we had the seasonal greens and the chips) were un-rememberable.As Flat Iron doesn't take reservations, expect to wait a while. There is a cash-only bar downstairs to keep you hydrated while you wait.Overall, this is 3 stars in my book -- it's ok, certainly not expensive, but I don't get the hype or the why people would wait 2 hours for a small steak...",

Customers are looking for a relaxed experience when they are dining out, and it is a big shame that Flat Iron makes you feel rushed and stressed even before you've sat down to eat.Unfortunately, after ordering a steak each and a side each, Flat Iron forgot our order. We were left waiting with no food for about 30 minutes, until someone came over to ask if we were okay. We stated that our food hadn't arrived, and then discovered that they'd completely missed our order after we had ordered.The staff were apologetic, and offered us our cocktails on the house, but it was still disappointing that this had happened.Although the steak, when it eventually arrived, did have a lovely texture and great flavours, it was a bit on the small side. If you're paying \u00a310 just for the steak, it was a bit of a shame it wasn't a big larger... All in all, it was an okay experience, nothing to rave out, and I'd only go back if someone else suggested it - I would never suggest to go there myself.",

It also comes with a small side salad. Medium rare= perfection. Along with a glass of white wine which tasted great. Boyfriend ordered the same steak with a side of cabbage and a different sauce. Both tasted so damn good! I was so impressed with this place that I would go back again. Service was exceptional- our waitress was so friendly, helpful, and attentive. Cool restaurant atmosphere.

    "text": "After having a difficult week I really wanted to treat myself and had heard great things about Flat Iron. I knew it would be difficult, especially on a Friday night, to get in so (expecting a 2 hour wait), I headed over early to put my name down while I waited for my boyfriend. They have a great system where you put your name down and they text you when your table is ready. At around 6 pm the wait for a table for 2 was about 45 minutes, but actually ended up being more like 30 minutes, by some miracle. Unfortunately, my boyfriend was running late so I decided to wait in line again to put my name down one more time. This time it was a 2.5 hour wait. When I got to the front I explained that we had a spot but weren't sure if they still had our table. It was a HUGE gamble but luckily they still had spots at the bar downstairs. This was 15 minutes past our time so I was beyond excited for this to have happened. Now the food! We ordered the steak, obviously, the fries and the bernaise sauce. While we waited we munched on the popcorn they give to every table, sort of like bread you'd get in an Italian restaurant, which is fantastic. Another really cool feature were the cleavers you use to cut the meat. They are adorable and can even be purchased \"as a souvenir\". When the food arrived it looked amazing! I tried a few fries first and they tasted nice :) I then tried the steak... WOW! It was absolutely amazing and perfectly prepared. It was probably one of the best steaks I have had in London. So tender and flavourful, from a fairly cheap cut of beef. We were both so impressed with the food and the price as well. We also got a nice salad which was a lovely addition. Normally I don't like mustard but I did enjoy it. Needless to say it was incredible and I definitely would recommend it! (Just get there early)",

    "text": "Like most people, I went to Flat Iron based on word of mouth and what my friends had said. \u00a310 a steak was too good to miss.The wait for a table was not too bad, as you can drink in a nearby bar and they text you when a table is ready. Not so good when you give them the wrong number though, as I did, and had to go back to ask them to change it.The venue is small, so we shared a table with 2 others. It was a bit intimate, and we could hear their conversation, but it made the whole experience a bit more sociable. It did feel, however, that you were on a production line - queue up, get seated, order, pay and go. The members of staff were very nice but were keen to get you served - and possibly out the door and free up a table - quickly.The food was good, and the popcorn as a appetiser was a great idea. The steak itself - the big star of the show - was a somewhat small portion, although expected for only \u00a310. It tasted amazing, but was served on a wooden slab with a mini meat cleaver which felt a bit gimmicky. The portion of salad was a nice touch but hardly worth the bother.A nice place to try out but I would probably seek out another steak restaurant next time.",

    "text": "Where to start... Ok, so people have been talking about Flat Iron for a fair few months now - \"It's this amazing steak place that does steak for just \u00a310 and it's really good\", \"you have to go, it's so good\" - you know, the usual. So Alex and I decided to give it a try before our theatre trip and being a huge steak fan I was rather excited!We arrived and were told the wait was 15 minutes - absolutely fine by us. We were asked to provide our telephone number and they said they'd text us when our table was ready. After 15 minutes (exactly) we were texted and we headed back to claim our table, but wait, it wasn't our table, it was ours, the couple to our rights and the two friends on our left. That's right, we were sandwiched between 4 people and when I say sandwiched I mean every move we made we were nudging into someone. It was uncomfortable and kind of tainted the romantic date night I'd had in mind...What I will say however is that their steak is good! We opted for the original steak and also their special Wagu NZ steak. With sides of chips, spinach and market greens.Free popcorn is provided as a tasty treat to start - gotta love popcorn, especially when it's free! Then the food followed quickly...Both types of steak were cooked beautifully, for me the Wagu steak stood out, it was succulent, with a slight smokiness to it - just really good meat. The original was also really tasty and for \u00a310 you can't really beat it.The sides were also good - the chips were slightly cold sadly but I what I will say is that the market veg is the bees knees - buttery, crunch, green goodness in the form of cabbage! I also ordered a side of peppercorn sauce which was damn good! Many places struggle with peppercorn but the consistency, and taste was just spot on. Overall it was just a very mixed experience. The food and service (our waitress was lovely - very friendly and helpful) was of a great standard but I just didn't like the way the restaurant was laid out and I don't want to be listening to other people's lives stories of how they're craving a burger because it's their time of the month (true fact). I've given it a three - it would be 3.5 if I could, I just don't think it lived up to the hype.Sadly, I'd be in no rush to go back and if I was to go back it would be at 3 in the afternoon on a Monday. Can we have our own table please?",

Creamy spinach side is my personal favourite and is a must try. The only issue with Flat Iron is that one cannot get in whenever wanted as long as it doesn't do reservations. But that makes the craving for it even bigger and is definitely worth the two hour wait. So you can either leave your mobile number in order to receive a text message later on with an invitation or wait in the bar downstairs. They have a cute cellar bar downstairs which makes it easy to pass the waiting time. Once you agreed to wait in the bar, you will be handed a pager which beeps when your table is ready. A cupful of popcorn and a jar of water will already be waiting for you on the table when you arrive. The tables fit 6 people so unless you come in a group of six, you will be sharing your table with the others, which can turn out to be a good place to meet new people ;)",

    "text": "So just a quick heads up! We went for lunch (Mainly because we couldn't be asked to wait the 90ish minutes the night before) when it is considerably quiter than dinner.\"Cheers for the information which doesn't add anything to the review kid.\"I think it does, I had a really good experience and the quality of the food I had was great. I can see the reasoning in others people's reviews who had to wait 2 hours. Obviously the restaurant was a lot busier \u00a0then and as a result with something like steak you could argue that there is a higher chance of the food tasting a bit worse (resting time, stress etc.)Anyway, a 10ball for a steak and some chips? Yes please! Did they really try and upsell me Wagyu for double the price? Nice try.. (Don't kid yourselves, the normal steak is most definitely good enough and there's not much justification for paying for the higher teir one in my opinion.)I bought a sauce (Bernaise) because I always have Bernaise whenever I can get it with steak and chips (Minority or majority here?! Answers on a postcard please..).Steak was great, cut up into decent sized pieces. I feel that if it wasn't cut up I would of finished it in half the time (I'm such a slob I know..). It's not massive, but it's only a 10ball and you can always get another one (one of my friends did).Anything was of a great quality and for the price and experience I can't give it any less than 5 stars.Definitely a place to try if in the area!If you have time maybe go to the door at 6 and put your name down, should save you some waiting.",

    "text": "The steak is soooo tender seasoned and cooked to perfection. I have been in London for three days and this steak was the best thing I have had. It is without a doubt one of the best steaks I have ever had. With that being said, now the cons. The steak is served with a cup of greens with some dressing over it, and that is all. If you want \"chips\" aka french fries with your steak it will cost you an additional \u00a32.50 and sauce flavors cost an additional \u00a0\u00a31.00. I must say, they do have the BEST chips I have had in London. Another con is the food all came out luke warm. If that baby would have come out piping hot, it would have tasted so much better. Also, a steak that wonderful should have the option to be pared with a baked or \"stuffed\" potato.Be prepared to wait. My pary and I had to wait an hour and a half to eat. Overall, pretty solid food, respectable atmosphere.",

My favourite thing about FT are all the craft beers and delicious wines that you can have with your steak.I haven't tried any of he specials yet, but from what my friends have told me, the burger is delicious.The chips are on point always, with a different member of the team making it each day?The only annoying thing is that it is near impossible to get a table for dinner at an appropriate time. I always find myself going to Flat Iron after the lunch rush or before the dinner crowd. If not you'll need to wait for hours. The seating arrangement can be a little cramped, especially during the cold months when everyone has a huge coat or jacket.The price is very very very decent and I always try to take people there if there isn't a long line.All in all the food outweighs the negatives.",

    "text": "I really want to give some background for these 5-stars. Apologies for the long form. Shorter, go eat this frickin' steak.My grandfather was a US Navy Seabee during WWII. Post-war this meant a long career as a boilermaker, traveling the world and throwing down local fare. One impressionable 70s stop, Buenos Aires and a trip inland for a gaucho meat feast. Result: I distinctly recall standing on a saw dust floor, in butcher shop outside Akron, Ohio in 1974 while my grandfather tried to negotiate the purchase of exotic, almost forbidden, flank steak. Like all Depression-era Americas, he regarded steak as a treat, a Sunday dinner if you were impossibly lucky. We did not play. Steak was serious business.I started cooking steak when I was about 13, around the same time that a trip to visit uncles in Arizona revealed the wonders of fresh steak fired over pits of mesquite. Simple beef, sweet smoke, and huge portions. Other highlights over the years: the Amish market outside DC with glistening, hours-old cuts which almost spoke to you; a Ruth Chris creamed spinach side that completely blew away its overpriced, butter-laden steak farce; a chilly, cold ranch outside Flagstaff, forgotten in time. Steak not.So given the glowing reviews of the joint, I was hopeful about Flat Iron, but far, far from convinced. And UK friends, understand this had nothing to do with locale, much more to do with rampant, universal, and uninformed steak hype. To maximize the positive vibe tho, we timed to hit this location slightly past the lunch rush. So, frankly, were the meal a bust, we could adjust. Twenty minutes after checking in, our party of four landed in the tiny (by US standards) but woody and warm space looking to get our steak on. And unless there is burger special on, your choice is -- a flat iron steak. Just do it. Order it no more than medium (medium rare is the sweet spot) and add a sauce -- peppercorn is great, the house Bearnaise sublime. Make sure you get the house cup o salad with an insane mustard dressing and -- well, the chips are wonderfully non-greasy and dip into the Bearnaise with EVIL ease, but for me the chopped, near minced, creamed spinach was a vital side. Sweet jebus.Contrasted with the rich, meaty char of the flat iron, the spinach was amazing. None of the bitter, herbal taste you can get with spinach, yet all of the earthy iron. Oh, earthy rich iron? Hello beef on beef flat iron -- prepped with just enough salt to make it zing without covering up the natural sweetness of this high-grade cut. Zero waste, zero fat, zero complaints. My grandfather would be jealous. That's all I got.",

I always opt for the \u00a310 steak, creamed spinach and chips. You could say I'm predictable but when you find a combo that is so good, you just have to stick with it! I like my steak rare and Flat Iron cook it to perfection. The meat cleaver shaped knife adds to the experience as does the overall style of the restaurant.I've been to two of the locations and from experience have found the Covent Garden location has more space so is easier to get a table. That being said as you can't book, I always say to my friends that whoever gets there first has to put our names down for a table. It seems to work quite well and there are loads of places to grab a drink in Covent Garden or you can grab a drink at the bar.My only tiny criticism is that a couple of times at the end of our meal we've been given mini meat cleaver tokens for ice cream but alas its not gluten-free. However, the Flat Iron team always let me keep the mini cleaver that I fashioned into earrings for a fancy dress party. Seriously this place won't disappoint!",

    "text": "Recently opened in Soho, Flat Iron is a great new steak house in London. Located off Regent's Street and just around the corner of Carnaby Street, the restaurant is right in the middle of a busy area in central London. You might find it a bit dark and quirky, but it is a very fine little place. The interior is simple, a bit industrial with its brick walls, but really warm and welcoming. The slightly unusual knives underline the uniqueness of this steak house. The menu is as simple as the interior. Basically, you do not have much choice. You actually do not have any choice: the only main is a flat iron steak for \u00a310. Flat Iron is not only the name of the restaurant, but as I learnt from one of the blokes there, also the cut they use for their steaks \u00a0and because this cut is not yet very popular in Europe, Flat Iron can offer its superb steaks for a budget price. Briefly after I was seated, I got some water and also popcorn. Yes, no boring bread, but delicious popcorn in a mug! Later came the steak, with a nice leaf salad and chips. I was not sure what I should expect from a relatively cheap steak, but it tasted simply delicious. It was cooked medium, as I requested, was very juicy with a strong meaty flavour and looked just beautiful on the black stone plate. The crispy crust with some salt on top made a fine finish. The chips smelled very intensively and were really crunchy, just as I like it. Despite I am not a big fan of salad, I quite liked the leaf salad with its dressing. I decided to take the Fred's sauce, after I could taste a bit from a nice neighbour. It adds a bit of a sharp punch but easily overpowers the flavour of the steak, so I did not eat too much of it. As of now, they do not yet offer any desserts. But when I asked for one, I was told they are working on something. I guess, this is just another reason to come back soon. In summary, the food at Flat Iron tastes great, and at this price, I am inclined to say that it is probably the best steak one can buy in central London for a tenner. Flat Iron offers quality steaks in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. Definitely another central London restaurant I will visit again.",
