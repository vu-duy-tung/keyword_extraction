The staff is fast and the flair routines they bust out definitely add a degree of atmosphere to the establishment. In spite of this, the layout of the place is horrible. I've been on a differing Friday and Saturday for separate occasions and both times I've found that after 10 pm, the place is unnecessarily packed. The layout of the bars and dance floor makes it impossible to get around, meaning that a trip to the bar to get a drink and back can last a very long time, in spite of great service. The bands aren't bad and the mix of music is nice, but if you're looking to hangout with some friends for a night out (and don't want to be jammed against the bar or in a corner), they're are better places in the area. However, if you want to see a band and have a few well made drinks, this is a pretty good place.",

This is not a classy establishment by any means, so please don't go expecting a vaguely sophisticated time, as you'll be bitterly disappointed.That's not to say that you can't have a great time in Roadhouse, you can, just make sure you're with a group of rowdy mates and you're prepared to share the dance floor with a few hen parties. It really is a place for large groups, just be careful when approaching the bouncers; if you're already half cut chances are you're not getting in. Drinks are typical London prices. And, during the week, it can be a bit of a tourist trap. Yes, there is a diner squashed onto the side of the bar, but you rarely see it full.From my hazy memories of fun nights out, I remember a lot of cheesy music transporting me back to my student days. Go with an open mind, low expectations and a gang of mates and you'll no doubt have a top night.",

I just adored how the place looked like and the staff were wonderful.I ordered two cocktails, buffalo wings and a sirloin steak. The cocktails (got the Hollywood Hills and Raspberrylicious) were simply fruity deliciousness, but I have to say it was lacking a bit on the alcohol side. Buffalo wings were as great as they could get in London. But the sirloin steak was slightly overcooked for my taste, despite requesting for it to be done medium rare.We had seats right next to the dance floor, so got a perfect view of the band while we were sipping our drinks, which felt like we were sitting at some VIP booth of a concert - lush! It was a bit cramped where our table was but it wasn't uncomfortable. The live band (The Tide) was great, \u00a0they did some brilliant songs including covers of Travie McCoy and Cee-Lo Green, and it just completed the whole experience. Plus I have to note that despite the band being on, and the place was completely rocking, it wasn't loud enough to just make diners want to desert the party.We stayed a little bit longer afterwards for the DJ - but the music that they played afterwards wasn't entirely up my street. Unfortunately as Jess B. noted below, the place was crawling with European boys on the prowl. Was not particularly happy when some bloke slimed his way next to me and proceed to grope me despite me telling him I was not interested!I will definitely be going back again, but next time I don't think I will be staying for too long after the band finishes their set!",

I couldn't believe that each of my amazing mojitos were less than \u00a32.50 each, they weren't even light handed on the alcohol.The food was great too, I had a burger with chicken, bacon and bbq sauce. It came with chips which were good but my friend got way more than me with her burger so was slightly envious of that.It has a really good atmosphere, there was people having there xmas parties there and the cocktails were certainly flowing.What was the funniest was the the poor waitresses who had to wear really skimpy \"sexy santa\" outfits, they were totally confident and seemed to be enjoying themselves so there wasn't the usual cringe factor with work place dressing up. The service was good and although nobody paid us much attention throughout the meal we didn't mind because they brought the drinks and then food really fast.Our whole meal with two main courses and six cocktails was only \u00a330, a total bargain for such a snazzy part of town.

There are different types of pubs, bars and clubs in London that cater my needs. Roadhouse for me is a place to start off during Happy Hour. Cocktails usually cost around \u00a36, but during happy hour (between 5.30 and 7.30 Mon to Fri), two cocktails cost \u00a34.50. The service is very quick and staff are friendly and cocktails contain an acceptable amount of alcohol (not like belushis which do TERRIBLE COCKTAILS)... But do not try to spend the night there. Start there and move on to somewhere a bit more lively and less crowded. you could try the gardening club which does happy hour until 9pm.Covent garden is not the best place to be on a fir or sat night. It is full of mediocre bars and pubs which are over-crowded and over-priced.",

I've written before about the West End on a Saturday night - and in Roadhouse it is demonstrated at its very worst. Firstly, queuing to get in somewhere never puts me in a great mood to enjoy it, and having to watch scantily clad girls pathetically attempt to queue jump makes me shiver with scorn. Once inside there is yet more queuing. The crowd is heavily peppered with backpackers (not sure why this place draws them in their droves, but it does) and more heavy handed bouncers than punters. To top all that off, the music is pretty dire. Having said that, it's massive, the bar stuff are friendly and very quick considering the crowds and I ended up having a pretty fun time with my big entourage. I wouldn't come back here in a hurry - actually, I wouldn't come back here at all - but this place is what it is and it took me back to my university days, something I won't complain too much about.",

I thought it was a laid-back pub-like venue and initially, it was pretty chill. But as it got later in the night, it turned into a meat market and full of drunk people. The usual suspects were present: guys in fancy dress, girls on the pull, old middle-aged men and an inexplicable group of either family or friends of all ages. The music was okay - mostly 90s pop/dance. I could not believe the queue outside when we were leaving.",

    "text": "Roadhouse is an absolute institution in Covent Garden. It has great music, live gigs on some nights, an amazing cocktail menu, and best of all if you are a true Londoner you will go during their 2-for-1 cocktail hours (usually 5-7pm), and have their food on BOGOF. Their drinks and food are not necessarily the best in London, but for the price paid during the offers (it is a tad bit expensive otherwise), and for the atmosphere, location (perfect place to start before heading on to other clubs/lounges in the area), you really can't beat Roadhouse! An amazing value for the guys is one of the massive sharing platters. Normally \u00a332, with a TasteLondon card or 50% off promotion it is only \u00a316, and for that you get 2 steaks, 2 chicken breasts, calamari, fries, salad, and other stuff! Bargain for only \u00a38 each.",

That's exactly what Roadhouse was like. It reminds me of Hardrock Cafe in the worst possible way. Sure it actually has music and live acts, but the surrounding music was so loud I had to shout at people less than 6 inches away from me (I'm more tolerant of that sort of thing late at night... but this was around 9pm).As a second stop on our pub crawl, it did not live up to expectations. It had potential for later in the evening, but it was not the sort of place I'd choose to hang out. I ordered a sex on the beach that ended up being extremely weak. Some of my companions ordered long islands that were also weak and didn't taste nearly as good as a proper Long Island despite having less alcohol. Really?I'd be a bit more open to an American themed establishment if the drinks were at least good, but the too tacky decor coupled with weak drinks and too loud music takes this place down a couple notches.",

It has been a long time since I've been and I was interested to see if the atmosphere was still as beer charged as ever.I should never have second guessed. I arrived in time to witness the heats for the UK Flair Challenge Two. All the contenders have moved on from the days I rocked the stage. The amount of taps, rolls and multiple item juggling is spell-bounding. The bouncing beats that these guys perform to really get the crowd going. All of the best flair bartenders in the world have at some point graced the Roadhouse stage, Nicolas St John, Christian and Rodrigo Delpeche. Just for flair alone makes Roadhouse worthwhile, but add to this, insanely drunk, happy people, beautiful girls in very skimpy outfits, selected cheap booze and Buffalo wings, and you may just have the best Sunday nights in the capital. Oh and how can I forget, Jagermeister girls selling shots for \u00a32. Woo hoo! For any aspiring flair bartender, the last Sunday of every month should be spent in the Roadhouse.

Ambience was good as i really don't know what to expect. As dinner time passes by, they do hold live bands for entertainment. Its kind a weird for me as when do they take a break, then it turns into a clubby scene for like 20 minutes then back to the live bands.As far as restaurant food, it was ok for me. Your traditional restaurant/bar food. When we walked in, we were somewhat greeted. It was a bit busy at the time but we asked to be seated for 4 people and surprisingly, was asked if we had made reservations. Since we did not make any reservations, we had to wait to be seated which was acceptable though they had few tables that were empty. Crowd was a mixed crowd though from my understanding that drinking age in London is 18. Overall, I don't mind coming back to this place and trying it again.",

Roadhouse is one of those places I've ended up at accidentally. I've never arranged to meet here and I've never planned a night here, they have just sort of happened. While the bar itself screams 'Tourists waste your money here' the place is actually not that bad. The food is on par with your average bar food and the drinks are reasonably priced, so long as its happy hour! The music is fun and later on most of the restaurant turns into a little club. It's a great place to dance and they have live bands and some sort of karaoke I've yet to try. Overall it's not the worst place to end up after a few too many and I'm sure it wont be the last time I do end up there.",

While the Roadhouse serves American food -- think burgers, nachos (topped with a peppery spice powder) and fries-- the rinks and nightlife atmosphere is where.

Surprised we were headed for the heart of Covent Garden. My first thought *oh god tourist trap* and I was right. It's a big garish place with motorbikes and neon lights here there and everywhere. A big bar surrounded by tables and booths around the outside. It was a bustling Friday night, but we had a taste card and so took advantage of that and the happy hour drinks specials. Overall we got a good deal, but paying full price for what we had would really bring that star rating crashing. There's really one choice for veggies, but even when my friends ordered came out they were pretty uninspired. But hungry so we gobbled it all up and got the bill. The food was fine. Nothing special but nothing to go back for. Luckily we'd managed to wangle a booth, which means we didn't have the wait staff rushing past us every 5 seconds and got a little bit of privacy. Being in the booth was great so I'd recommend asking. The waitress was busy so there were no 'hi how are ya's, but she was on it. I initially got a wine glass which clearly had not have been cleaned at all - mmm lipstick marks - but got it changed pretty quick. Apparently there's a rock karaoke competition here once a week and a bit of live music, but I'm thinking it's really for the tourists or the fans of tack. I think this place has to be your thing... it's just not mine.",

They were really good about it and the three of us got a free drink each as apology, and we had a really good night in the end (despite me starting out so disproportionately disappointed haha). The cocktails are priced erally well at \u00a37 each (considering we're in central London!)We tried again on a Monday, as we were told they were quieter, and not only did I sing but I won! First prize is a \u00a3100 bar tab (that can be used on any night until the expiry date), second prize a bottle of champagne. We got there extra early to make the most of the happy hour - prices are seriously amazing (\u00a35.50 for TWO COCKTAILS?!?! But it does end fairly early so we made sure to stock up for the evening)! Also the nachos are delicious, huge and GREAT value - the two of us have mega appetites but we couldn't even get through them. There is a substantial cocktail list, of which I have now tried a few, and they are all amazingly well made.Went back this past Saturday to spend my bar tab and the bouncer was friendly enough to check whether we would be able to use it that night which was nice, as it is not specified on the voucher and we started wondering whether you could only use it at a rockaoke night. It turned out we could use it so we went to the bar when we got in and the only stipulation was that you had to be sure to return to the same bar tender all night, and to use the whole tab that night - neither of those things were a problem. The band was great, the DJ's afterwards were great and we stayed until closing! For value, I would definitely recommend the porn star cocktail goldfish bowl, it even comes with a bottle of prosecco to top up as you please! All this, plus great decor and a really fun atmosphere. Highly recommended!",

Sprinkle some glitter...there's always room for glitter. Throw in a live cover band and Happy Hour every night (Toto's Africa and two-for-one cocktails? Don't mind if I do...) you sort of have Roadhouse. Located in the stomach of Covent Garden (I would say heart, but it's underground, so meh..), this would be a perfect spot for whipping off that tie and getting down for some after work drinks. Be warned: bring cash. Their card machine doesn't always work (except, inexplicably, for South African credit cards...tr\u00e8s zarbi!) and one of the bar staff tends to get a bit arsey about it. But once you present him with cash and compliment his hair, he softens and it's all water under the bridge. There isn't always anywhere for large groups to sit. Just as well there's usually a great cover band playing tunes ranging from classic rock anthems, to contemporary chart toppers, and a small dance area. The cocktails are a suspiciously good price for central London and, with Happy hour til 7:30, there's plenty of time to get a few rounds in. Good thing the toilets are well kept; you can cocktail it up to your heart's content, in the knowledge that you have the option to throw caution to the wind and pee freely in all the sparkling cleanliness Roadhouse has to offer. Speaking of welcome cleanliness, their food looks pretty decent as well. I've only ever made it as far as the bar, but I would happily brave the rush-hour mush and try their Philly steak sandwich. I'll be coming here again. Would recommend: Their Big Mac Daddy: \"A large measure of Jack Daniels mixed with Amaretto, fresh raspberries and topped off with ginger beer.\" Get with extra cherries.",

I overheard one bouncer tell a guy he could come in but could not drink as he'd had too much. He didn't seem in the slightest bit drunk to me!We all decided never to return here again.",

    "text": "Set in the heart of covent garden this underground venue takes you back to the 1960's American dar/dinner experience with the bright red shiny coloured booths in one area and the tables and seats everywhere else coupled with the art work all over the walls but for me it is the Harley Davidson sitting on the top self of the spirits section in the middle of the central bar.There are smaller bar areas around too which are needed during the 2-4-1 happy hour(s) 5:30 - 7:30pm. Towards the back there is another long bar area on the other side of the dance floor which can get busy once the music kicks off later in the night.Overall the bar has plenty of space for everyone early in the night for an after work drinks place but can get busy later on, arrive early to miss any cover charge, cloak room available.I like it.",

    "text": "This my first cocktail bar find in London, unsurprisingly it's in the heart of Covent Garden where I spend WAY too much of my time :) having said that, it's more hidden than initially thought as its an American underground bar and diner. Now I haven't tried the food here, which has always looked WAY too overpriced for my liking, but no one can complain about happy hour until 7pm with two cocktails for about 5.50!! More of those in London please!I recommend the porn storm or hollywood hills if you have a sweet tooth as they hit the spot nicely! Overpriced out of happy hour, but catch it until 7.30 and you've. Got a nice after work spot in the heart of tourist town!",

    "text": "Having read the existing reviews, I felt like I knew what I was getting into here. And it did what it said on the tin. It's sort of a mix between a club and the Hard Rock Cafe, where you think you're too cool to be there but you have no desire to leave. I was there with a girlfriend and I would recommend it to any ladies who want a bit of an ego boost, because Man, these boys are aggressive. I've never experienced anything like it. I would not, however, recommend the Porn Storm fishbowl as a good idea. It put me on my ass pretty swiftly. If you're looking for something mildly ridiculous, aren't too keen to remember the details, and fancy a bit of casual flirting and bopping you're onto a winner with The Roadhouse.",

I was only really here for happy hour and then we went on got grub elsewhere but we did try their nachos which was quite nice. It wasn't really packed on a monday night but it still had quite alot of people who were mainly there for cocktails. It's pretty easy to find, it's right next to the london transport museum, and near bedford street.",

    "text": "Always a great night out at Roadhouse, particularly with cocktails on 2for1 or a bit cheaper during their happy hours (varying times throughout the week). They do some tasty little bar snacks as well as bigger food for the more hungry, which you can either eat at one of the restaurant type tables, or at one of the smaller tables with high stools around the stage and dance floor. They have fantastic music here, lots of local (and far away - last night when I went they had a band from Australia) bands playing live music. My favourite group that play here is The Tide, but whatever or whoever your favourite, they list them all on their website and so you can see when you want to go based on who is playing. Bartenders and security are nice and friendly, and if you go on the right night (last Sunday of every month I believe) you can see some flair competitions behind the bar, with bottles and glasses flying everywhere. My only criticism is that if you're not buying during Happy Hour the cocktails and other drinks can be a bit expensive, and cocktails are so easy to drink that you end up spending loads, but that's the aim of the game, isn't it?! Apart from that, a solid club, great d\u00e9cor inside, perfect for a good night out with a couple of friends or with a larger group.",

It's styled as an American diner, complete with motorbikes behind the bar. There's plenty of space but usually a good crowd on the dance floor, and it doesn't take too long to get served at the bar. The best part, however, is the live band - arrive on a Thursday before it gets too late and you're likely to be treated to an unknown but live rock band, smashing out old favourites. Not a bad place to fall into at 12am!",
