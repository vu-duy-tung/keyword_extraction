    "text": "What a shame.. Having been to their original site in Brixton many times and praising their authentic delicious pizza, we were disappointed with their offerings at their new Tottenham court road branch. Expanding their business has clearly ruined what I feel was an almost perfect combination of genuine Neapolitan pizzas with good ingredients in a grubby (in a good way!) corner of Brixton's market row. The Tottenham court road location is very formulaic, typical of your average Carluccio or Ask restaurant. The service was appalling. Not only were we seated at a table with the last customer's food on the table but the number of times we had to get the attention of the staff just to order our food and ask for the bill was ridiculous.With an open kitchen in the middle of seating area you would expect (or hope) that the staff would be aware of general food hygiene knowing full well that they are being observed by the seating customers. One waiter who was using a metal sponge to seemingly scrub off the burnt edges of each customer's pizza (why do that?!) accidentally dropped the sponge on the floor and promptly picked it up and placed back on the table ready to use again for the next pizza. Having eaten at Santa Maria's pizzeria in Ealing a few weeks before, the pizza of franco manca that I used to praise so much is no more. Ingredients are stingy and the base definitely different to how I remembered it in Brixton.",

    "text": "3.5 stars.First I have to preface this by saying I love Neapolitan pizza and have had it many times in pretty much everything restaurant worth trying. I have quite a high standard. Franco Manca's is good, but that's about it. Not great, not fantastic.It's a super popular place so Saturday around lunch time we were lucky to only wait about 10 minutes. Friday night they apparently had a one hour wait.The place is charming, open, and spacious. Nice rustic vibe. Huge pizza oven in the middle. All Italian workers, which is a great thing.We got the marinara (#1 - tomato sauce, garlic, oregano and I added basil for 50p) and the margherita (#2 - tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil but we subbed ricotta for mozzarella. The mozzarella isn't the best quality it seemed from looking around but the ricotta seemed rich and creamy. I appreciated no charge for swapping out the cheeses).The marinara was good, but lot very flavorful. When you get a pizza so plain, it's very important that the dough and tomato sauce are top notch. These were not. They were each ok. Nothing bad in particular, but not great flavored. Tomato sauce was weak and a bit acidic. The dough was bland dough. The texture would be benefited by undercooking it by a few seconds.The margherita with ricotta was better, but really because of the ricotta. The buffalo ricotta was great quality - rich and creamy with a delicate but powerful taste. Overall is recommend that one.I would be back because it's still good, the atmosphere is nice, friend service, very efficient (pizzas are made very fast even when crowded), and the portions are huge for the price. I'd recommend trying it, but don't expect amazing food. Definitely good overall though!",

    "text": "Among my friends there is always a debate on who has the best pizza: pilgrims or Franco Manca. Sincerely, right now I still prefer Franco Manca, but over 4 people I am the only one with this preference with 3 votes for pilgrims. Considering I'm far better than my friends, that makes our final decision even, 3 votes each. One day we will find the winner!Anyway, this is just another good pizza place, with a plus for their appetizers. We have a small number of pizzas (as it should be), and a small selection of appetizers (usually just salami, cheese, ham). Appetizers are just what they say to be, good, excellent ham and cheese, that's it. No special things, nothing extreme, just a good mozzarella with a good evo oil.The pizza is on the neapolitan style, nice, high and soft. Now, sometimes it could be a bit undercooked, true, and they don't offer buffalo, which is just plain stupid and crazy, but it's usually a very good pizza, high and soft, with a very nice ring and with good ingredients on top.I just have some issues with the desserts, which seems supermarket style (or anyway something coming from big production, not homemade) and with the beers, I can't understand why they decided to subscribe a plan with a reseller where they can't serve anything else!Ah good aperitivo if you like, a nice spritz! take a spritz, a couple of appetizers and a pizza to share and you made your evening!This is surely in the top 3 of London pizza, not at number one (I'm looking at you, stand at the hawker house) but for a pizza place, that's really good, I mean seriously good.",

    "text": "First of all the map here is WRONG. So wrong. Damn you, Yelp, damn you to hell. It's on Tottenham Court Road, just go there, do not look at the directions on here. Pretty sure I had heard of Franco Manca before tonight and at the very least bookmarked one of its other locations, but when a friend suggested here tonight some faint alarm bells went off in my head*. Quite frankly, when you have a much-loved original venue and you branch out to more, the quality deteriorates and yet the crowds keep coming.**In future, I might well stick to one location only places. Because I'm pretentious like that. As soon as we sat down, the Pizza Express, sorry I mean Franco Manca waiter was right over, to hassle us into ordering. Charmingly monosyllabic he was. We ordered some garlic bread, burrata and pizzas each. The garlic bread was startlingly lacklustre, basically it was like a rectangular pizza base with some sauce and no sign of garlic. Pass. I love burrata. LOVE. So I was prepared to forgive it any sins, but when our virgin-burrata-eating-companion declared it bland, I had to agree. Sure, it can be a bland cheese, but with the right seasonings, it's a fucking symphony! This burrata was more elevator music. Onto the pizzas. So the sourdough base gives these pizzas a delightfully moreish personality, but when you get almost done, you do feel a bit like dying. It's almost the opposite of crisp neapolitan pizza. Mine came with various cheeses and meat, it was the Gloucester, I think. Very nice indeed, but I oddly wouldn't return. I did get pleasantly drunk on the \u00a32.80 glasses of wine, so yeah, whoo! This place is cheap, that's why people go there, but when I saw the queue lining up outside, it felt sad, cheap is not the same as good. There are thousands of restaurants in this city and no need to queue for any of them. *On Tottenham Court Road, no less, can you think of anything good on TCR?**Ahem, looking at you, Burger and Lobster. And you, Meat Liquor!",

Don't mistake me, it's a very good pizza compared to non-italian standards but it's far from perfection. Basic ingredients are average quality - in particular tomato sauce and mozzarella. I don't understand why they do not offer a buffalo mozzarella option (a must have for a pizza restaurant aiming to great quality) but the \"Salsiccia e friarielli\" (wild broccoli and sausages) is probably the closest thing to a real Naples pizza. What really I don't like is the dough texture - it's chewy and it leaves a background taste of ground flour - it could really be improved!That said, If you're around and want a pizza, is still better than most place you can find around (but not worth a 40 min line, less then exceptional on weekends)",

Most of their ingredient are organic and fresh, all branded as no name or no logo. The pizzas are very thin and quite hard to cut through (using your hand to rip is actually much easier). Everything tasted as you would expect. But \u00a36 for a large sized personal pizza? YES PLEASE. I wouldnt wait more than 30 minutes but if the restaurant is not very busy, Im all over it.",

Just watch out for any modifications or add-ons - they will charge you for each and every one, and it adds up!Nice open kitchen where you can see the pizzas being made. The service could use a bit of work, but then again they are pretty new at this location.I personally prefer Pizza East for both ambiance as well as more variety on the menu, but I would say this is a solid choice for a satisfying meal that won't break the bank.",

    "text": "Franco Manca on Tottenham Court Road must be a very recent addition to the slew of restaurants in the area, since I only just noticed it a few weeks ago. The interior is inviting and both times that I have gone, we have been seated pleasantly and promptly. They serve pizza. There isn't much more to say there--you get a big blackboard with their specials written on them on the wall, and there's also their selection on the menu--you may also have the option of creating your own pizza, but additional ingredients do get pricey; to get your money's worth you may as well order from the menu. Both servers I had were efficient and pleasant--shoutout to the Italian one with the very short dark brown hair--she sells the menu well without being overbearing on the customers. The dough on the pizza is amazing. I saw some diners leave their crust, but who am I to leave such deliciousness on my plate? It is thin and crispy and chewy, the ingredients are artisanal and fresh, and you can see your pizzas being made right there in the center of the dining area. For around 6-9 pounds for a pizza, the price can't be beat for Central London.I can definitely see this spot becoming a regular haunt for me--I can't wait to utilize the takeaway option in the future.",

    "text": "I chose this place for a quick Monday night bite with a friend in town, having never tried Franco Manca before but well aware that it's considered one of the best pizzas in town. I arrived around 7 PM and there were about 5 parties in the queue ahead of me, but the staff quoted parties of 2 a wait time of 10 minutes, and a party of 4 a wait time of about 15 minutes. I thought that was impressive, because the restaurant isn't that big but the queue did indeed move fast! They don't seat tables until all members of the party are there and my friend was running late, so when he finally arrived, I was at the front of the queue and we were seated almost immediately.It didn't take long to order because the menu is fairly straightforward - you have a choice of 6 pizzas, with the option of a salad and some drinks. I got #4, which was with ham, mozzarella, ricotta and mushrooms. It has a note that says \"little tomato\" and the waitress checked if I was ok with it having little sauce, because I guess people complain about that normally. I was fine with it. We also got two bottles of lager, as they didn't have the pale ale in stock. I thought it was really good, tasting like honey and not at all like your typical lager.So our pizza arrived and it was your typical oversized pizza - I don't know how people ever justify that it is meant for one person. The problem is that the table is so small, that you wouldn't even have room to share food... At Pizza Pilgrims, we did so with no problem as it was a much larger space, but here you only have room for a plate in front of you! But soon after, one of our friends who studies nearby wanted to come join and say hi, and when she came, she just grabbed a chair from a neighboring party of 3 and we rearranged so that we could all fit at our table meant for 2.This really annoyed the staff, one of whom came over immediately and asked where we got the chair from, then said that it was not ok and that she couldn't sit there. It wasn't bothering anyone else, or a fire hazard, but he was really pissed off and didn't even offer us another table where she could join. And there wasn't anyone else in the queue, so it was not a ploy to try and clear tables faster. Basically then my friend had to wait at the door while we asked for our pizzas to be packed up and paid the bill. It was the most unfriendly service I have ever received and I didn't even get to enjoy my pizza!",

These freshly made pizzas are simple yet work amazingly well and cook in just a few minutes in their wood fired oven. The menu is small, yet everything you could want on pizzas - with the choice to add different toppings if you fancy it. I've sampled these types of pizzas through the likes of street vendors such as Honest Crust at Friday Food Fight - and was always impressed, but Manchester doesn't have a restaurant where you can go and sit in to eat such amazing pizzas. With 10 of these branches to choose from in London there's really no excuse not to pop into one! Franco's also makes and bottles their own organic lemonade - which was gorg! For someone who likes and eats A LOT of pizza - this place hits the spot. And there just so happens to be one in Balham right near my friends house. Perfect!",

The service was good and friendly. I could try the wine before choosing a bottle which was much appreciated. The wine list is short and the wine is cheap but not really good. I'd rather pay more for a better wine. The 4 of us shared pizzas. They're good, dough is fresh and so are the rest of the ingredients. However these are not the best pizzas Ive had.Bottom line is I was a bit disappointed with my experience at this place but I guess I had set my expectations too high.

    "text": "This is a pretty awesome place to grab a quick pizza for lunch. We came here around noon on a Friday, and it filled up quite quickly (but I've walked by it on other days of the week and it seemed less busy at similar times, so it's probably quite popular on a Friday). There isn't a massive selection: the pizza menu is quite small. They do allow you to add toppings if you so choose though, which does allow for a bit of customization.The price is pretty reasonable as well. You're looking at less than a tenner for a pizza, and if you don't go for any drinks or sides, you've got yourself a pretty cheap and filing lunch. I ordered the meat special (some proscutto with cheese and radicchio), and I was pleasantly surprised. The crust is slightly crisp, but mostly chewy with a hint of sourdough (so if you're not a fan of sourdough, this place wouldn't be for you).The service is super attentive as well. We got asked twice if our pizza was good (but I think it's because they were on the hunt for a pepper grinder to take to another table and the first time I didn't let them, because I actually wanted to put some on my pizza). They also did the really confusing non-British thing of removing my plate before everyone was finished. They're also really good at being ninja-water-bottle replacers as we were never without a bottle with sufficient water in it.They also provide some olive oil on the side. But not regular oil, there's a bottle of garlic oil and a bottle of chili oil. I found it very delicious to dip the pizza crust into when I was down to that end. The chili oil was especially nice (and what I was looking for because the chili I ordered on top of my pizza was a tad lacking in spice). So four stars for the food, but an extra star for the delicious oils and fantastic service. To be fair, they were probably trying to get us out quickly as there was a massive queue when we left, but I didn't really mind that much.",

Quality mozzarella and tomato passata. The sourdough base is a really strong feature and the most enjoyable part of the pizza. You leave feeling light and happy, not bogged down by carbs.Although not on the menu, the desserts are lovely! Chocolate cake was simple and a nice addition after a Margherita pizza.

I tend to go here for fun dinners with my fiancee -- I wouldn't recommend going for a business lunch simply for the potential noise level.Pros:- Great pizza- Fast service- Very efficient (it's the little things, water is served and replaced at your table with no action on your behalf, for example)- Extremely reasonable pricesCons:- If you go at a busy hour, it could well be very, very loud in the restaurant- If you go at a busy hour, you may be standing outside for a little bit in the queue (although this is understandable -- it means they almost always seem to be able to be at max capacity)",

HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Chorizo pizza. \u00a0Sooo good - on the menu it seemed plain to me at first, but you can add whatever other toppings you want. \u00a0Closest thing to pepperoni on the menu. \u00a0Also, the burratta appetizer was so delicious. \u00a0Like ridiculously delicious. \u00a0I want it now.In the end I was super full but enjoyed every...last...bite. \u00a0Now, can I find a place like you here in LA, Franco Manca? \u00a0That is the question. \u00a0#mmmm",

They consider this the best pizza outside of Italy.My confession is that I don't love Neapolitan-style pizza. DON'T TELL THEM. But I have actually been converted a little by Franca Manca (and Pizza Pilgrims), and given the really top ingredients, I might even come back for the pizza occasionally.I couldn't finish a whole pizza with the crusts, so I left about half my crusts, which were eagerly snatched up by our eating companions. Apparently the chili oil I doused on my plate was spicy for them, whereas I couldn't taste it much. So, different taste buds, yet positive experiences all around!",

    "text": "Bellissimo!Went there with friends yesterday as my B'day dinner, and it didn't disappoint. What a dinner to start the night with!We weren't really excepting a long queue on a Monday night. We reached the place around 8:30 and there were still three groups waiting ahead of us. We waited about 15 minutes and finally got in. We tried No. 2(margherita), 4(with hams and mushrooms), 6(with chorizo and tomato) and Meat Special(with lamb sausages). We had our own and tried a slice of each other's. Unanimously, our rankings is: 6# -- Meat Special -- 2# -- 4#. I loved my chorizo one, and the flavor is great. The only thing I can complain is that I wished there were more cheeeeese. The meat special one comes next. The lamb sausage on top tasted absolutely lovely, but again, we wished there were more of them...The margherita was cheesy enough, but we all felt 4# was a bit too light and weak in flavor. It might have tasted better if there was a bit of tomato? The dramatic bit is that a waitress sent what should have been our orders(two 4#) to a table next to us, and we arrived much earlier than them. She didn't realize the mistake until another waiter found out. The gentleman who was in charge of our table was really nice. When we asked for our bill, he offered us five limoncello as the digestvo in compensation for our waiting. What a beautiful mistake! We never mentioned anything about the birthday, but it seemed we still had our birthday special! :D I've been trying to learn some Italian for months, so I also experimented some italian conversations with him, and he was absolutely sweet to ignore all the lameness. Overall, we were all very happy with the food and the service. And I think I forgot to mention that the price is very reasonable and the quantity is more than enough!Buona serata!",

That would be more that enough to buy an entire pizza to share in the states, but is considered inexpensive here. Comfortable environment that is upbeat and busy, and my friend told me that there's typically a line out the door and impossible to get a seat inside. Luckily we were able to find a table inside on a Saturday night. Food:+mozzarella cheese ball with flatbread appetizer: this was the best food all night. The mozzarella is a large ball that has a delicious smoky taste that goes great with the arugula on the side. They only provide 4 tiny pieces of flatbread though. +chorizo pizza: I was happy that the pepperoni pieces were large and had some bite to them and not stingily cut and thin. The pizza shape is irregular because they hand toss the pizza and the crust is thick and airy. There's already a lot of oil, but it also tastes great with adding more spicy oil on the top. I only finished half. Great experience in a local joint. The pizza is average but comparably better than most of the foods I've had in London.",

My friend ending up scraping the extra tomato off as she doesn't like it and then when the bill arrived I noticed an extra charge, I wasn't going to grumble over 95p but I thought I'd just mention it to the waitress. On doing so she grabbed the receipt and said she'd take it off, she came back and quickly and impatiently processed our order and then sarcastically thanked us and stormed off. We were pretty surprised to say the least.",

It left a bad taste. She was very aggressive and angry as we asked if something was an extra charge. I've never been treated like that in a restaurant before!",

    "text": "What: One of London's best sourdough pizzas. That's what they're know for and that's what they do well. Don't bother with dessert, it's not really their forte.Tip: Yes, you'll want some garlic pesto with that. And probably a bit of olive oil too to dip the crust in.How much: The bill usually comes to around \u00a320 for two people. No, I don't know how they do it either.When it comes to date, most people think expensive, Michelin-type restaurants, where you have to dress up to get in. \u00a0I usually think small, rather busy restaurants that would let me sit there for the entire evening, sipping wine (or cocktails, I'm rather flexible you know!) and eating all sorts of delicious things straight from the plate. But that might very well be because I'm not really good at booking tables, or planning dates in advance for that matter...One of my favourite places to visit for un-planned dates (and general meals out) is Franco Manca. I go pretty much every single time we're near Warren Street. I went when my friends visited from France. Hell, I even went for brunch on Valentine's day! And also some time last week...The burrata (from the specials board, but it features onthere quite often!) was creamy and light, and the accompagning toasted sourdough toasts and salad were great too. From the small pizza menu, my absolute favourite is the n\u00b06 as the chorizo is excellent.cakeandwhisky.wordpress.\u2026",
