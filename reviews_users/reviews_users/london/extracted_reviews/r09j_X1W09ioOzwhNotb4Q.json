But the service, welcome and quality of food changed everything. Particular highlights were the juicy yet crunchy tabbouleh, the heavenly baba ghanouj and the de-lish apple and ginger juice. And all really cheap too: mezzes are around the \u00a34 mark, and drinks just shy of \u00a32.Needless to say, I can definitely seeing myself stopping here in the future to get my food fix before heading westwards on the train.",

The staff are as friendly as they come, and the restaurant has a casual atmosphere with lots of fun drawings on the walls. This was my first time eating Lebanese, so I tried one of the specials recommended by the waiter that was a lamb and spinach dish. It was delicious and very filling. Their house apple, ginger, and mint juice was so yummy and I find myself craving it months later! They also give you a tiny piece of baklava at the end of your meal, which was an unexpected treat. Next time I am in London, I will definitely make another stop here.",

We were tired, hungry and thankful they were open. The staff greeted us with big, cheerful smiles. The food was fresh and delicious. And they were kind. On our way out we grabbed a bottle of water but we didn't have any British pounds on us. We offered to pay by credit card but they just gave us the bottle. The next day we went back for lunch and offered to pay for the water and they kindly refused payment, saying it was their pleasure.",

I got confirmation and once I opened it.. it was the same usual crap.So .... sorry I cannot give them more than 3*. even this is only due to the complimentary baklava. I sure hope that mine is just a one-off.",

Our 2 minute wait for a table to become available, was barely noticed due to the friendly staff explaining specials and getting us menus. The menu is full of typical middle eastern fare to suit any taste. We chose to start with some deliciously smooth homemade hummus, and fresh flat bread. This was followed up by a whole roasted baby chicken and my friend a lamb shawarma.The place didn't quieten down the whole time we were there, with people coming to sit down as well as queue up for take away. This small place has an easy atmosphere about it; between the close knit tables glances and comments were shared about how good everything is. For us, it was the perfect extension to a few pints in the pub, and with it's close proximity to Paddington, it could serve as the ideal destination for something a bit different to munch on the last train home!",

We ordered the hummus with naan bread, grilled chicken with salad and couscous, mixed grill with sliced lamb, minced lamb, and chicken the first night and it was cooked perfectly. The next night we had chicken shawarma, which is also sooo good. We also had their special tea both nights. I highly recommend this place.

I was looking forward to the idea of Lebanese all day since it was suggested yesterday. And I must say that I was rather delighted! The food was so well prepared and all fresh \u00a0and fantastic. Walking in from the street I was bombarded with scents and smells that made my mouth instantly water. The very best baba ghanouj I have ever had! And their apple ginger mint drink was so delicious! My friend and I shared 4 mezze dishes and a lentil rice salad and it was all fantastic! There was nothing left and with the tip was 27 quid..that is an outstanding value for how well prepared the food was and that we got 5 dishes..Nice family, super friendly and the little dessert baklava were a little taste of sweet heaven!

I can't say that I've ever had \"Lebanese\" food before so when I was in the Paddington area but not quite ready to take my train back to Reading, I let Yelp do the searching and the suggesting. And now I have a favorite place to get a meal before getting a train!Clean and welcoming, I looked over the menu and went with a hummus starter and the Lamb Shawarma (with cous cous instead of rice). No beer of course, so I had a bottle of sparkling water instead.The food arrived almost immediately. The hummus presented nicely in a bowl with another bowl of cut up pita breads for scooping. A moment later, the lamb. A generous portion with a nice salad and a good pile of cous cous. Delicious and moist, I completely cleaned my plate. I would have picked it up and licked it if I didn't want to be thrown out. Since I was so appreciative, they gave me a free bit of baklava for the ride. (Not the usual triangle - it was rolled. Strange but good!)A fab deal for a decent price. I was stuffed and ready for the train back to Reading. I will absolutely return!It's just across the street from the station, so there aren't any excuses.",

I watched for a little bit as they put plates together. \u00a0They put one plate together that was supposed to be lamb shawarma (mine) but put chicken on it too. \u00a0It sat up there for a little bit and when the waitress saw, told them it was wrong. \u00a0So after a few minutes they took off the chicken, let it sit a little longer and then added some warm lamb on top of the lamb already there. \u00a0It was about 10 minutes time from the time it was first put up until they brought our meals. \u00a0By the time it got to me, the lab was really cold dry. \u00a0It was not enjoyable and had no flavor. \u00a0The rice was also very dry and flavorless. \u00a0We drank our water and never got a refill and the waitress never came back to ask how anything was so we couldn't even say that the food was cold. \u00a0I don't think I would ever return to Ya Hala if I were in the area and it would never be my first pick. \u00a0It was mediocre at best.",

You could say my expectations were nonexistent.I only tried some of their mezze during that particular visit but it was fresh and tasty. \u00a0Fast forward a few months later and I discovered that my flat was actually within their delivery zone on Deliveroo and subsequently my fondness for Ya Hala dinner nights blossomed. \u00a0Everything we've tried has been delicious but standouts are the crispy falafel balls, lamb kebabs, and grilled baby chicken. \u00a0The tuom and spicy sauce are the perfect condiments and if you request more they are super generous about it.Will definitely be back whenever I'm in town!",

You won't be sorry. Get there early if you want tabouli!Don't let the one surly waiter discourage you. Think 'soup nazi' and you'll be fine ...if you have a sense of humor. He even looks like the soup nazi. I'd put up with a sourpuss any day to eat this good food. I've eaten here four times; once in 2015 and three times this past May. The food quality has always been lively and fresh and delicious. They have another place in Brixton as well. Hands down, this is my favorite restaurant in London. It's equal in NYC is Hummus Kitchen (3 NYC locations). How lucky am I/are we to have both!)Enjoy!",

The rice and salad that accompanied it was fresh. I was really impressed with the price points. I felt you got a real value for your money.Service was adequate.

I love the chicken wings (but be warned, they take a little longer to prepare) and the sauce with the soujuk (sausages) is amazing to mop up with the bread.The shawarmas are my favourite, for kebabs I prefer Indian/Pakistani super spiced versions but they do have a decent selection of well cooked meat.Honestly, Id be happy with just the starters and bread though, all tied up with a pot of their amazing tea which has hints of mint and rose and cinnamon.Very reasonable prices. Friendly service and oh, they also have washrooms downstairs. Definitely look at the cartoons on the walls, they have all been drawn for the location itself.",

Following the suggestions of another Yelp person, I preserved the following:1) Appetizer: \u00a0Mouta belle - damn good; humus - ok, but not great. 2) Drink: Ginger, mint, apple juice. \u00a0It is very good. 3) : The menu says it's for 1, but you enough food for 2 ... and it's damn good as well. Mixed Mezze . \u00a0So much food that the 2nd order Lamb schwemma (spelling ?) had to be taken back to the hotel. \u00a0As with a few other Yelp listings!be leery of the directions. \u00a0They're off by a little bit.",

    "text": "I dropped off some luggage for the Heathrow Express and went to Ya Hala due to the great reviews online. \u00a0Turned out if anything the reviews understated how good Ya Hala is, probably the highlight of my trip.Started with the grilled halloumi cheese. \u00a0It was good, nice and well seasoned (led by salt), sizable portion.As everything looked good, I went with the mezze sampler. \u00a0Really loved the two kinds of meat (chicken and lamb shwarma), both were tender, marinated and tasty. \u00a0All the mezze were also good. \u00a0Loved the hummus, again good flavors. \u00a0Very nice eggplant and okra dishes. \u00a0Several other dishes (i think about six in total), all very good. \u00a0Wasn't crazy about the potato, a little too spicy.Overall, great meal and rather than going just because it is near Paddington, it is now a destination unto itself.",

The lamb was great and I loved the couscous and Pita:) The charcoal chicken was a little dry for my liking but the sauce they provided helped that minor issue. Definitely great for a late night snack and have excellent deserts!",

    "text": "This place is absolutely amazing. It's small and always busy but it's worth the wait to get seats. We went twice while visiting London. Waited one night for about 10 minutes. Second night we walked in at perfect timing for a table. They also do take away. The hummus is to die for. Not typical American but smoother, richer and more flavorful. The falafel is also perfectly seasoned and crispy. One night I tried the mixed schwarma and both the chicken and the lamb were tender and perfectly seasoned. The Lebanese couscous is impeccable. Their \"special tea\" is the only thing to get for grown ups and older children will also likely enjoy a small glass. Second night I had the \"weekday special\" they make lamb or chicken Lebanese style and only serve it on weekdays. Get it if you go M-F. Prices are so reasonable and the service is great. As a bonus,Alex, one of the staff loves Americans!",

    "text": "We \"discovered\" this restaurant by ourselves without the help of Yelp! We just WALKED in. \u00a0 We needed a table for four to celebrate my 47th wedding anniversary. \u00a0 Seeing only small tables for two and a large one with a reserved sign, \u00a0the waitress to our pleasant surprise simply removed it and seated us in the best table of the house. \u00a0That first welcoming impression was followed by both the familiar menu Mediterranean dishes and the new. \u00a0I loved their lentil soup and my fellow diners were \u00a0captivated by their lamb chops. \u00a0I was smitten by the soup and told the waitress how I felt. She claimed that they had the best Lebanese chef. I wanted to return again but had to try lentil soup at another restaurant for comparison. \u00a0My informal taste test only confirmed her claim.What brought us back for three dinners out of four were the two waitresses who were attentive and personal. \u00a0On the day after dining there, \u00a0when we were walking by, the waitress waved to us in friendly recognition.While they were busy, they were able to satisfy my curiosity about their food, their home country, and were able to share about our mutual immigrant experiences. \u00a0As we are now about to set sail on a 15 day cruise from South Hampton, via Iceland to New York which will be replete with many types of cuisine, I nonetheless am experiencing a sense of loss. When I return home to the San Francisco Bay Area which is a foodie haven, I will still longingly recall this dining memory on London Street.",
