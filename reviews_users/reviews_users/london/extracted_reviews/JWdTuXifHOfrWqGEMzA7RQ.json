I had the lobster lightly grilled so you got the advantage of the 'grill' taste but a more tender meat. The cocktails are also great - bit pricey but they are unusual so not your bog standard cosmos. My bf got a burger and it was also really tasty but I think for the price I'd go with lobster every time!",

    "text": "I'm going to try and keep this review shorter than my others, a challenge no doubt! \u00a0I don't want to admit to loving this place, but alas... I do. \u00a0My first few experiences with lobster in the UK weren't the best experiences, the price versus what you got was never there compared to what I was accustomed to in the land o' plenty... OK, the land of too much most of the time. \u00a0I digress. Quite a simple concept with this place... you can get a burger, a half lobster, or a lobster roll for \u00a320 with chips and a salad... aside from dessert, olives, and mixed nuts this is it and they're all the better for it. \u00a0I have to say though, I'm astonished in how many people get the burgers... the lobster is a great value, the burger... not so much. \u00a0I guess burgers are very in fashion now, but they have never looked that great to me here... they don't look bad, they just don't look like they're worth passing up good lobster for. \u00a0They do various mix and match specials, which may be the way to go if you really have to try both offerings. I personally had the lobster roll on my first visit, and quite liked it, but have gone with grilled lobster with a side of garlic butter every visit since... to me this is the only way to have lobster, although they have a steamed option as well for those that would prefer it. \u00a0I also really like the fries, they're the skinny type, perfect for dipping in your left over garlic butter. \u00a0The salad is a great side as well since it's actually a little salad with a bit of balsamic, croutons, and parmesan shavings included. \u00a0(I absolutely love the UK, and have lived here for eight years now, but three pieces of rocket on the side of my plate is not a salad... that's garnish my friends.) ;-) For the curious, if you want to order off of the board and ask for an idea of size they will often disappear for a short while suddenly reappearing with our live friends in tow... this mortifies me! \u00a0(I get that most people would go for this, and there is definitely an \"ahhh\" factor with people taking pictures, etc., but I prefer to believe that any type of live food comes from a magical place... perhaps a Star Trek replicator, that's magical enough for me.) \u00a0Back to the subject on hand... if you're dining with a pal and they also want lobster it's often a better value and a bit more fun to order one off of the board. \u00a0Example: Two smallish lobsters, adequate in size don't get me wrong, with fries and a salad will set two people back \u00a340... if you see something on the board in the \u00a345 - \u00a350 range of value then go for it... you get more for your money, it's still a good value, and it comes with unlimited fries and salad for both of you. \u00a0(Multiply this logic if there's more than two of you... I've seen some groups basically split what I would consider a sea monster among them which is infinitely more fun than ordering separately.) I suppose I should mention their drinks... they do nice cocktails, but they will set you back... this is London, so it's not a surprise, but it's hard to swallow two cocktails literally costing as much as your lobster meal. \u00a0(OK, it's never hard to actually swallow a cocktail, but you get my drift.) \u00a0That said, they do 3/4 pints of Asahi which are the perfect level of cold every time, I swear they must be served at the world's best temperature for this type of beer... sometimes I find myself here drawn by that alone, with the lobster being a bonus. As for the place itself, it's in Farringdon and \"feels\" as such... this isn't a bad thing, it's got that modern yet quirky feel to it which seems to work so well for the area... it's a decent size, but still expect to wait at least for a bit on any given night. My last note is for a dessert I had on my last visit, a chocolate ice cream sandwich on chocolate wafers which was flat out awesome. \u00a0I'm not sure if they make their own desserts, or have them made somewhere else (more likely), but this one was a winner for me. \u00a0It wasn't at all too sweet, and despite the way it sounds was quite light... this may not be a good thing for someone praying for death by chocolate, but it was enough for me to go from a \"did I really just order dessert, shoot me\" mentality to an \"I'm so glad I ordered dessert\" one instead. \u00a0I've had a few of their other desserts, which were always OK, but if this stays on board then it will be my go to dessert if there happens to be room. I'm torn on this one... I'm going for 5 stars, because that's what it is to me, but if you're going for the burgers then it may actually be a 3, which I suppose rounds to a 4... which would be fair if you're doing a mix. \u00a0Still, good lobster at a decent value in London is worth 5 stars for me... they should just change their name to \"Lobster & Lobster\" and be done with it. (Who knew I could ramble that much about a place that only has a choice of three mains?!? \u00a0I truly and sincerely \u00a0thought that this was going to be my shortest review.)",

I went for the Lobster Roll which is fresh, steamed lobster that is chunked up and put in a roll (as opposed to frozen mush that pretends to be lobster that I've seen at other places). When the plate arrived I thought I would still be hungry at the end, but the roll was more than filling. I think the bread is dipped in butter. It was delicious. A friend got the burger and it looked equally fabulous. Although for the same price, I'd go for the lobster.",

The lobster is grilled and apparently you can ask got it not to be. Grilling may be the reason the body was a bit over cooked and rather small.

But it's taken me a while to get myself to one of these establishments, as I am put off by no booking policies.We opted for the Farringdon branch, as we thought it would quieter than the Mayfair or Soho ones on a Saturday. We went for about 6ish, which is a little early for dinner but I get grumpy when I have to wait too long for my food. We were really lucky and got a table quickly but it was stuck on the end of kitchen bar near the till station so lots of noise and busy staff behind us. But hey who cares when there's a lobster served on a tray in front of you!The lobster option is probably the best value for money, although that said the lobster roll and burger are substantial. Extra sauce is essential and manners do not matter! There's a nice selection of drinks. Don't know what the desserts are like though.Good for when you need a lobster fix!",

Burger, lobster and lobster roll for 20 pounds each.Since we are visiting from the US, we wanted to try all three. Luckily, our friends were gracious enough to make sure we ordered one of each so we could try. Burger - huge, juicy, delicious! Yes we paid 20 pounds for it but still... coming from US where we eat burgers often, we just HAD to try it. Lobster - order it grilled or steamed. Its fresh, big, and you get the whole thing. Lobster roll - it is what it is, juicy lobster in a roll. Delish!Overall, the price of the food here compared with a lot of other restaurants in London is extremely reasonable!!!",

    "text": "The Farringdon location doesn't take reservations for small groups, but when we came here on a weeknight, there was no wait for seats at the \"bar\" high seats by the kitchen. The menu is pretty straightforward (and unwritten)- you can either have a lobster (steamed or grilled), a lobster roll (warm brioche filled with cold lobster salad), or a burger (supposedly very good). All are \u00a320. It is also possible to order larger lobsters with prices listed on a chalkboard on the wall. The staff was quite attentive; they came over quickly and we had multiple waitresses trying to serve us. I ordered a whiskey cocktail that was pretty average, then I got the lobster roll while my friend got the lobster, grilled. Both come with fries and a salad. I LOVED my lobster roll, especially dipped in the butter sauce that comes with it, even though it's something you would naturally have with just the lobster. Such a treat and definitely worth the indulgence every once in a while!",

On the other hand I've also been trying to eat less meat recently so the chance to have a whole lobster with fries and salad for \u00a320 seemed to make perfect sense - especially due to the fact that being a single diner, I could eat at their counter area and get down to business. It was good too! A fairly decent sized lobster (for a UK restaurant - you may get laughed out of town in a U.S coastal area...) - it hit the spot and was with me in 10 minutes, with a tasty non-alcoholic raspberry lemonade - yes people, I was having the time of my life!Overall a nice place to visit with a good atmosphere and friendly staff - I guess I should mention that hence the name you can also get a gourmet burger and sides for \u00a320 too giving you a fairly clear choice of 2 types of meals.",

I'd been to the Dean Street location previously, but I much prefer the Farringdon location - much less chaotic. At the chain's Soho location you are more likely to face a crowd, and there's something unsettling and off-putting about eating while the people around you are angling for your table - personally, it doesn't make for a particularly pleasant dining experience.The menu is simple - you have the choice of lobster (grilled or steamed), lobster roll, or burger - all with a side salad and chips for \u00a320. For those who can't be forced to choose, if you have a willing companion you can split both - each get a burger, and half a lobster for around \u00a330 which also comes with a dessert, as seen below.I went for the grilled whole lobster, which came with a buttery sauce, salad and fries. Deliciously succulent lobster, perfect fries and a lovely salad - it's so simple, but it's a recipe for success.All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable working or payday lunch, at excellent value. The atmosphere is pretty casual, so although the menu might seem impressive this is more a place to come with friends rather than a date. And leave your vegetarian friends at home - there's nothing for them here!",

The burger is overwhelming, sorry - NO other word for it! My colleague picked it up and I swear, I almost couldn't see his head anymore. Needless to say, I requested a bite. And. It. Was. Awesome. Burger heaven, for sure! But remember: serious food business so make sure you're hungry to devour this beast. And they receive bonus points for their Pinot Noir. Overall - great experience!! And..... Now this just here-say, and please use this info wisely.... I'm going to share this with you.... Burger & Lobster is popular in town. Let me rephrase: HIGHLY popular and it's quite difficult to get a reservation, especially if you feel like 'going on a whimsy'.... This Farringdon location is n\u00f3t that super-duper-busy yet. Great chances that you will be able to eat here, even when you call 30 minutes beforehand.",

Their lobsters are fresh from Nova Scotia (that's in Canada friends). As I've always wanted to go to Nova Scotia for a lobster roll, I think I can technically check one thing off my bucket list! Melted garlic butter comes on the side in a metal cup and I was generously pouring the butter over my bun as I ate which made the lobster even more awesome. At first the bun seems a little small but as you are halfway through the roll you begin to appreciate that it really is a very dense roll.The fries were done just right, with their toasty temperature an excellent contrast to the deliberate cool temperature of the lobster meat that is lightly mixed with Japanese mayo. With the side salad and fries the \u00a320 meal filled me up just right. Even hours later this I keep thinking about how good that lobster roll was and how I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "There's one restaurant that's been particularly trendy in London. The name is clear and concise: Burger & Lobster.There's no menu, only three dishes are served: Burger, lobster and lobster roll.For 20 pounds each, it doesn't take a genius to figure which is the most popular one.In a city like London where a depressing plate of salad can easily cost 10 pounds, a meal of lobster, salad and fries for 20 pounds is truly a steal. Thus it's not surprising that this place has become enormously popular, and has expanded to 4, 5 branches in London. I tried to go to the Soho branch once and the queue was 2.5 hours at 5pm. A little too ridiculous even for this crazy foodie. Today we chose the Farringdon branch. It had a 20 minute wait at 7:45, and there's a nice bar area to wait about. Not bad at all.The lobster was very fresh. You can get it steamed or grilled. The steamed version with a dash of lemon juice and a light cider was absolutely heavenly. Fries and salad were lovely as well. Will recommend!",

There really isn't much service in this place, the bill took forever to come! Whereas the food takes minutes to arrive, as its steamed and grilled and put on the plate.It is a tad mediocre, the lobster is ok in taste, nothing special, what really makes the whole meal is the lemon and garlic butter! Salad is meh, a few leaves put together sprinkled with some cheese. The fries are ok.The bill was \u00a354 in total including the service charge. i mean I have no issue in paying, at least its under \u00a330 but nowhere near \u00a320 as to what I paid last year.Don't think either myself or my friend will be going back!",

All \u00a320. Which, if you break it down...pricey for a burger or a lobster roll, great deal for a lobster. It's all inclusive of sides though, so in the grand scheme of things...it's about what you'd pay elsewhere for similar fare. Simplified. ---Vegetarian? Probably not. I would not suggest for you. As Emily C's ode to \"shelly friends\" alludes to...it's all carnivore and shellscavore up in here. At first I was a bit wary...as I've been trying to detox a bit, but when you break things down....a whole (fresh) lobster with a side salad is not too shabby in the health department. It does come with a BOAT of garlic butter, but even a bit of that isn't going to do too much harm.All in all I really enjoyed my first whole lobster, it was prepared perfectly, the salad (they gave me two since I opted out of chips!) was fresh and flavorful, very simple. Our server was quite jovial...When a restaurant chooses to do 3 things...you can bet they do those 3 things VERY well, and in the case of B&L, this is true. Very, very well. 4 stars, 2 claws and a bib up!",

Each costing \u00a320, just so's there's no confusion ya hear. \u00a0Obviously, this makes the burger a pretty goddam expensive one. \u00a0And unfortunately I can't vouch that it was worth it, as all of my party went for the lobster in one form or other - gotta get your money's worth! \u00a0 I have never actually eaten a lobster 'whole', so this was definitely entering a whole new territory for me. \u00a0Our waiter was a wholeheartedly pleasant chap who took lots of time to instruct us on the eating techniques of our poor little buddies. \u00a0(Tip for those who don't know - eat the meat inside the claws last as it stays hottest the longest!) \u00a0The lobster came with a gravy boat of melted garlic butter, a tin of fries, and a green salad. \u00a0 Overall it was truly delicious. \u00a0The one thing I would suggest to improve to a five star marking would be an improvement on the fries. \u00a0They were nice, don't get me wrong, but I guess I was expecting something a bit more special than the average straight cut no seasoning stuff we got. \u00a0But hey, lots of folks may be relieved about that. \u00a0Overall, apart from the plastic bibs which are obviously worth going to B&L alone for, other top points to note are the extensive drinks menu (superb cocktails), extremely amenable staff, and slick yet comfy decor.",

    "text": "So they've finally opened more than one B&L! Meaning I could try it sans queue!I've been to the one in Smithfields twice now (mainly to take people there on separate occasions). So it does what it says on the tin. My only gripe is that they automatically add on the service charge.... Other than that it was fine, good service (if not a little too attentive, this ain't the US!). The garlic sauce is gorgeous! Great deal for the lobster, although drinks & their service charge add on will certainly jack up the price! A nice treat every now and them for sure!",

    "text": "I'd seen Burger & Lobster's name a lot in reviews (all positive) and blogs so I thought I'd give it a whirl, seeing as I am always interested in a great burger. I was curious about the lobster roll though, not that I have ever had much lobster, but I'm always game for something new and I noticed it had gotten a lot of buzz. I had lobster once before in a curry that I really liked so I thought it might work out.The Farringdon location for lunch was pretty crowded but we still managed to find a table. The service was alright and the place was filled with people on lunch breaks.I went with someone and we ordered a burger and a lobster roll and shared so we could try both. Sadly, we both found out that we do not at all like lobster and the best I can say for it is that the brioche roll it was on was toasted to golden deliciousness and it was all I could stomach of the lobster roll. So warning for people who are not big on seafood and don't know if they like lobster, you really really might not like it no matter what other people think.We were hoping the burger would make up for the lobster roll, but unfortunately it was certainly not worth \u00a320 or any other amount of money. It was tasteless and much too big for any person with a regular-sized mouth to take a bite out of without half the burger falling apart. I don't mind large burgers if the meat actually has a flavour, but this just seemed lazy and thrown together with too much salad in it. Even the bread was nothing like as good as the crisp and yummy brioche roll. The french fries were very mediocre. I really couldn't eat much of this overpriced meal and I left hungry and searching for another restaurant.They should take the Burger out of the restaurant name because it's completely the wrong reason to go here. Unless you love lobster, I wouldn't go here.",

But they haven't thought about preserving our hearing !As with many places in London, regrettably, the music in the restaurant is way too loud to be honest, and people have to shout to have a conversation...Otherwise, in terms of food, the burger is probably the best I've had in years, so juicy and tender that I didn't realise until I had eaten half of it, that there was no mayo or ketchup yet in there !The fries were cooked perfectly, thin, crispy, and not greasy !I also had a taster of my friends' lobster, to complete the Surf n Turf experience (hehe), and I found it exquisite, with a very tasty meat sublimed by a garlicky sauce...Ouch, my taste buds are still amazed !",

    "text": "Very good food. The atmosphere was classy. The service was nice, and they didn't make us beg for more water (like other restaurants in Europe). Our family had one of each entree. The burger was great and juicy. The pickles were sweeter than I'm used to, so they were pretty good. The lobster was very tender. It is also relatively close (20 min walk) from London Tower.The main downside is that all entrees are \u00a320 each, and they greatly incentivise \"one dish per person.\" Prepare your wallets.",

    "text": "Been here with a work buddy - we both got the lobster roll. Since everything was 20 quid, I was a bit reserved on its value.Needless to say, when I dove right in the lobster roll, it was refresh, cool, and tasty full of creamy lobster (maybe a bit much on the creamy part). The chips that were served were nice and hot, thin and stickly, with just the right amount of seasoning/salt. Salad was also good, but then again, I am not a salad guy.Service was good - the wait staff made sure we were taken cared of, and that it was.My buddy and I left happy with good service and full bellies.Next time I come back, I am going to try the other two options...though it may be the lobster!The place was a bit loud, and if you care about your clothes not smelling like burgers, chips and lobster, then go elsewhere. More room and opportunity for me!",

Our waiter was super nice and he recommended the steamed lobster with chips which we went with. Even though the menu was so small he was more than happy to accommodate for my dietary requirements. He even arranged for a birthday surprise, so much fun! Would recommend this place to anyone.",
