The Frued Gyoza and the Potato thing (at least i think it was potato) were really good. The rice was good but the chicken was just perfection, It was crispy and the teriyaki sauce was so \u00a0good. Just writing this review im getting hungry. OOOH and the Jasmin Flower tea. I was amazed how the was. I never seen tea with a flower blooming inside the hot water. And it was like the BEST jasmin Tea I had. When I go back to London I am for sure going back there again.",

I always have a happy full tummy.We happened to be in the area when my ramen-loving friends wanted to go. With trepidation I took them, and they were pleased with their tonkotsu ramen. Pheww.I don't see much point to getting anything else off the menu as it is really overpriced for things out of a freezer pack. But dang, they do quench my thirst for a ramen during an evening out in Camden.",

Cause between me and you, I needed the help. I love Japanese, but I'm normally not so inclinedAnd Asa Kusa was closed, so something else we needed to find...Service was inattentive, waitstaff rude.Our server was nice, but don't know what was up with these other dudes.What could it possibly be, me? Is my voice too loud? Was I headsnapping, fingerpopping in polite company?No one else seemed to be the recipient of their foul moods.Ignored their sniffy attitudes, and tried to enjoy the food. And I would have done so, except. It was so bad, I could have wept. Into my miso, soft shell crab and broccoli and garlic main, It was covered in a white gravy, great it was not, no culinary Citizen Kane.I don't know what my friend had. But I didn't want any, the meal was less Thriller and more Michael Jackson Bad. If I'm being honest, I am not a fan of raw salmon. She kept giving me a side eye, so I know she was too polite to mention. Dear Yelper I would give Benny Ramen one star. But I'm keen not to be mean, so two will do by far. Would not return.Benny's that ex you know isn't worth your time, once a flame and twice a burn.",

    "text": "Food here is reasonably priced and at good portions, always a huge plus. I'm originally from NY and ever since moving to London I've been looking for good complex sushi (not like the wasabi style piece of boring sashimi on a plain bed of rice) at a good price and have struggled to find a good place. So coming across Bento Ramen serving some really interesting sushi was a pleasant find. My boyfriend has never had sushi so tasty. Please note that obviously when I say tasty, its not necessarily comparing with the best sushi places like Nobu etc where you pay and arm and an leg for FRESH sushi. Im talking about interesting combinations of salmon, tempura, roe, spicy mayo, etc. Tasty sushi that wont make you broke exists at Bento Ramen! Separately, we've also tried their ramen, I had the \"super spicy chicken tonkatsu\" which in my opinion is not really that spicy, but to a westerner's taste it can probably be considered super spicy. My boyfriend ahd the original pork tonkatsu and he thought his was ok but lacking some flavour in the broth. He ended up mixing some of my spicy broth to liven up his ramen. Overall I would still say the ramens are pretty good for the price you are paying. It satisfied my craving regardless of being an average bowl of ramen. This is obviously not a Michelin star restaurant so dont come in expecting it to be that way. Lets be honest, the vibe here is very casual and its not a place to be seen, nor does it try to be anything different. I would recommend this place as one of those places where its just a normal night out when you are hungry, in the area, dont want to spend that much money, and craving something savory. I enjoyed the food and would definitely re-visit when I'm in the neighborhood.",

Huge fan of their lunch specials...soup, steamed rice, gyoza, a delicious deep fried pumpkin fritter, and a main (think teriyaki chicken or a bowl of pho) all for less than 6 pounds. Quality is high. Note, the teriyaki chicken is deep fried and is more like a kapungi chicken than a traditional grilled Japanese teriyaki chicken. That said it was super tasty and I'll be back---assuming I go back to Camden town:)",

However it's fair to say the majority of my time was spent in the tiny ramen shops under the railway bridges, and the chain shops selling huge bowls of ramen at cheap prices. I had it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And it just doesn't seem to exist in England... Apart from maybe here.The set lunches are the best deals with a selection of ramen, rice dishes or hot pots that come with miso soup, a pumpkin korroke and 2 gyoza, for under \u00a37. Sushi sets are only around a pound more. The ramen are huge with rich, delicious broths, a really good selection of toppings and proper chewy, yellow, ramen noodles. It's not perfect, but it's very very close.I've been here twice and think I'm going to come a lot more. When I've tried the sushi and had an evening meal here, it might just become 5 stars.",

    "text": "We've been to Bento Ramen about six times over the past couple of months. This place is great! The ramen bowls are generous and a good value at \u00a36.50-\u00a38. The tonkotsu is not the best I've ever had--the pork broth isn't quite as rich as it should be--but it's still pretty OK. The slices of pork are really tender, and the ramen noodles themselves are always very fresh and firm. I've tried five different versions of the ramen, and I think my favourite is the seafood wonton with roasted pork. Nice combo of flavours in a chicken broth. The chili pork dumpling ramen was extremely spicy--and I can take a lot of spice, so consider that fair warning. There is also a starter/side dish called Marmite Squid, which we had to try, just on account of curiosity about what that could possibly be. It's battered fried squid tossed lightly with a sweetened marmite sauce. We were prepared to either love it or hate it, but it actually works really well, with the combination of salty and sweet. Pretty addictive, actually.They've recently started offering some sushi items from the Bento Sushi menu (the apparently sister restaurant on the next block). Since they opened we've noticed them getting progressively more busy, so word is getting out. The staff are really nice, and the manager, in particular, is very welcoming and friendly. The room is pleasantly decorated and we really enjoy coming here for lunch, especially on a chilly day. They offer take-away too, though I wouldn't think of ramen being an ideal take-away item.",

I do not think this should be mandatory. \u00a0If the waiter is guaranteed a gratuity would he or she have an incentive to try as hard to give good service? \u00a0I tend to tip better if the service was good, i.e. not just doing their job. \u00a0And I rather give it to the waiter concerned then go direct to the employer which I expect it does as it is included in the bill.",

    "text": "3.5Okay, so when you have \"ramen\" in your restaurant name, you better be serving up some damn good ramen. We didn't get to try the bento yet, but the ramen we had was the Tonkotsu ramen and the honey roasted pork with dumplings ramen. Also ordered the dim sum sampler. Tonkotsu broth was bland. It's a bit sad (and funny) that the menu claimed the broth was boiled for 8+ hours because upon tasting the broth as a die-hard ramen fan, it definitely was one of those instant packs you get at the Japanese supermarket. Bone Daddies and Shoryu Ramen in SoHo kicks Bento Ramen's butt.The broth for honey roasted pork with dumplings ramen was even more basic - chicken broth with a heap of thinly sliced spring onion. Again, lazy broth. However, the dumplings in the ramen essentially saved it. The shrimp and pork filling in the dumpling was flavoured brilliantly with sesame oil, white wine, salt and pepper. This makes for a truly juicy bite. The dim sum sampler was also a shining star of our meal. All the dumplings were done very well - each bite locked in the right amount of \"juice\" from the filling and it just had this pleasant after taste after each one. I could eat those all day.I definitely will come back for the dumplings and dim sum. Perhaps the bento and sushi will take this restaurant to a higher rating in my book. Stay tuned! Oh, and pass on the ramen.",

    "text": "What a lucky find in Camden! \u00a0Ok it wasn't my find at all- as I had a friend living in London recommending it to me, after lusting after some sushi all day. Overall we had to 2 hours to kill before our late evening train back up to Manchester, and with it only being a sone\u00b4s throw away from the station it was a perfect final stop of our day. The restaurant itself is spotlessly clean, full of members of the asian community and the menu small- for me the first things I check in asian restaurants. Bento Ramen claims to be slightly Japanese but the selection is rather on the Pan-Asian-Fusion side. Although praised for its Ramen, we decided to order various cold dishes after a super hot day out. Between us we order fried baby squid, the chef\u00b4s dumpling selection, baby calamari, sashimi salad, hot summer rolls, prawn skewers and rice as a side. All dishes arrived after just a short wait, all freshly prepared and more or less at the same time- perfect for sharing. The fried items, had different batters and were fried in fresh oils. No greasy stinky crust. The summer rolls ( salmon roll, topped with scallops and caviar) were excellent and we actually just ordered them after seeing the lovely picture of a fellow yelper. The service on the night was very attentive and friendly, which often is an issue at asian restaurants, and also the reason I\u00b4m not setting in RED CHILLI any time soon. All dishes were cleared straight away, with a smile and double checks if we liked everything. Yes I liked everything here and would definitely return. Overall we paid just about 55 pound including drinks ( beer/ water/ coke), wich I find really good value for money given the freshness of the dishes and the location.",

The pork chashu and egg were good too though the overall bowl isn't as good as specialist ramen places like Bone DaddiesI paired the ramen with spicy sakekawa roll - a maki roll containing salmon skin, sesame and spicy mayo.

It's 'Asian' food designed to appeal to the Camden crowd and they do it well. Oh, about the ramen... Noodles over-cooked, broth nothing special. 'Tokyo egg' was cooked properly but wasn't marinated. No scallions or nori either- just the silly neon pink rice cakes that are true to ramen tradition but horrible IMO.

The waving cats wave hello, and they stoically wave goodbye to me when I have a smile and a full tummy.Whether it be a brief visit at lunchtime or a more relaxed evening meal, I have always had a good meal here, and some of the time it has been truly excellent.Although not the best decorated nor the best vibe possessed in a restaurant in London, what it does give is reasonable, Japanese style food for a price that does not leave you wincing.They do some great set menus at lunchtime that can either be sushi, ramen or terriyaki based. All of these come with a side dumpling and the miso soup. Rather confusingly, even if you order a Ramen soup, they still give you an additional miso soup. Many times I've left here of a lunchtime sloshing down the street like a skin covered the bag of soup.Generally, when I come here during the evening, I go for the sushi that they offer. It is not groundbreaking in terms of the fish that they offer, nor the way that they present it. I am a big fan of the Sumo Platter. For \u00a332 you get 24 sushi rolls and 12 sashimi slices. And even though it is not revolutionary, what they do, they do well and further a fairly reasonable price.I have definitely paid twice that for dodgy London sushi and have felt ripped off in the past.The highlight of my last visit was my excellent waiter. He really did make a fuss of us and I must say it was the best service I have ever received here, and quite possibly one of the best servers I have encountered in London.All in all, I really do have great food here, serve the reasonable price. As long as they carry on doing this. I will keep on returning for ever and ever!",

The dumplings were pretty good (and a total bargain, 8 for \u00a38), and the ramen wasn't bad.- Noodles - not bad, but maybe not quite al dente enough - Egg - this was a total let down. It was hard boiled, so not soft/gooey, and not seasoned, so didn't taste of much.- Soup - The miso soup was good while I ate the noodles, but not amazing enough to keep drinking it once the noodles were finished. Marc's spicy tonkotsu soup was better, just not as good as shoryu or bone daddies.- The buta kakuni on top of my ramen made the whole thing better...it fell apart between my chopsticks and was yummy.I trust Jessie and Steve's opinions, so I guess I'll just have to come back and give this place another chance...",
