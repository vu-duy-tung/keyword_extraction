We got there about 15 minutes before they opened and there were already a line, it's easy to say we weren't the only ones who wanted to come here for lunch. We grabbed two seats at the counter which was awesome because we got a first hand view at the preparation. These guys know their stuff and are a well oiled machine in the kitchen, really cool to watch.My dining partner got the pappardelle with ragu which was wonderful. I got a pasta that I was warned was spicy (I think the one with Nduja) and it definitely was, it was intense but very good. \u00a0I would totally go to this place if you are in the area, we loved it.",

    "text": "If you want authentic, freshly made pasta, and want to feel like you've been transported into Italy for a little bit, then look no further. This place serves 6 appetizers, 10 types of pasta (mainly pappardelle and tagliatelle), and 2 desserts, so it's a fairly limited menu. They do have a decent amount of vegetarian options.This is located right by the London Bridge station, and close to Burrough Market, and you'll likely see a long queue outside the place around peak lunch and dinner hours. I came here around 2 pm on a Friday and didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes for a seat at the bar, but right after we were seated, the line grew to about 15-20 people. Be prepared to wait at least 15-30 minutes if you come (or more), and don't come with more than 2-3 people as you may be waiting forever for a table. Most the seating is at the bar, counter along the window, or small tables. Burrata (\u00a35) & Bread (\u00a32) - I didn't care for the burrata too much. It didn't seem to have too much flavor to me, and was creamy in the middle but there was too much of a hardened shell around the cheese. It was good with the olive oil and salt, but at times I felt like I was eating chunks of salt that wasn't well-distributed in the dish. I would stick to just the bread and olive oil next time.Pappardelle with 8-hour beef shin ragu (\u00a38.5) - The noodles are were al dente and delicious, and the meat was tender and had been slow-cooked in the tomato sauce. The size of the pasta dishes are on the smaller side, and they do put a lot of parmesan cheese on top of some of the pastas -- so if you're lactose intolerant or don't like cheese, just beware.The service was a little bit on the slow side - I don't know why there was a 15-20 min wait from when we got the burrata to when we got the pastas, when everyone around us ordered after us and got their food before us. It was a little annoying and I didn't find the waiters particularly friendly.All in all though, a solid pasta joint that is still relatively quick from start to finish (after waiting in line), and worth a visit if you are craving Italian food. Just be prepared to wait in line and know that they don't take reservations! I'd come back here again but not sure if I would wait more than 30-45 min in line.",

Though this place is small, they accommodate 15 people every 10-15 minutes or so, you don't really feel like you are squished next to the people your sitting near. The pasta is super fresh and really tasty. I got the beef ragu pasta (and I think my boyfriend did too) and it was great. We also tried the gnocchi to go along with it. Though it was good, I wasnt too crazy about the gnocchi. The staff here are super nice and attentive. Don't let the crowds of Borough Market or the queue to get in deter you from going here. Padella is a place I will definitely return to on my next trip to London.",

A great peppery tasty in the firm pasta. The portion was small, but so was the price! Just \u00a328 for 2 people including 2 glasses of wine. At first I did pick a dish but the waitress warned me it's very spicy, lucky she did as I'm not too good with spicy food! So I picked her recommended dish of Pici cacio e pepe (and I'm glad I did!). Go check it out - but be prepared to queue. I went at lunch time on Saturday and was seated immediately (lucky I guess!). Overall, 7/10.More reviews on my Instagram: mattzard",

    "text": "You've seen the queues, you've heard the hype. Is it worth it? Almost.The queue began 30 minutes before opening on Saturday morning. By the time they opened, there were 60plus in the queue!Once inside, we sat in the basement which is not dark and dingy as you might imagine, but a light, bright space with a high ceiling, minimalistic styling and very cool vibe.The menu is short and to the point. We were also told about their specials. We ordered burrata, their beef carpaccio special, bread and then 5 pasta dishes.The bread and burrata was excellent, as was the carpaccio but I don't know why it came swimming in oil!The pastas took quite a while to come but \u00a0in the end, they came together, which was unexpected! The crab was a little underwhelming for the price, but the pasta itself was excellent. Just needed alittle depth from the crab.The spinach ravioli was the best! Really flavourful, delicious but slightly smaller than the other dishes for some reason. The meat pappardelle was lovely, slow cooked meat and lots of flavour.The smoked eel was an interesting one for me. I don't like smoked fish and thought this would not be the dish for me. Also, the fish was in cubes rather than flake pieces. The flavour was excellent, real depth, slightly creamy and very interesting. The chicken liver dish was great, the sauce was yummy and, to my absolute delight, the liver is cooked pink, in other words, as it should be!The presentation is rustic, there's parmesan everywhere!! And you'll need to save some bread to mop up the pasta sauces! Overall, I liked it. Theres a couple of tweaks needed and of course, it's not like pasta in Italy but it's an interesting place with a great vibe, good service and apart from the crab, good pasta. I wouldn't queue, but I would wake up early to be in the first wave seated.",

Worth the wait in line, and the cozy seating (a little cramped for my taste, but worth it).

It is the best pasta I have ever had and in my top 3 favorite meals of all time (and I am not really a big fan of pasta dishes or Italian food - I wouldn't normally ever order pasta at a restaurant & tend to avoid Italian when going out). Arrived at 7 I think, waited for about 10 min to put our names on the list. The wait was 2 hours, but you don't have to stand in line there, so we went off and explored Southwark and had drinks at the nearby pubs to pass the time. They call you when they're ready, so we came back and they seated us (just 2 people) up at the bar downstairs where they make drinks and prepare some food, which was cool to watch as we ate.The prices are insanely good. Our meal for 2 with 2 appetizers, pasta for both of us, and 2 drinks each came out to like 60 GBP. For London, that's a steal. We shared the burratta (omg so good) and radicchio salad for appetizers, both of which were fantastically fresh. I had the Pici as my main dish (recommended by our server) and as I said - best pasta i have ever had. One of the best plates of food I have ever had. I want to move to London for this dish. My boyfriend had the Pappardelle, which seemed to be a fan favorite as every table had at least 1 plate of it. I was iffy on it. I think it was just overshadowed by how good mine was! I had 2 negronis because the first one was so good I had to have another ... and they're only 5 GBP. Service was incredibly friendly and had great recommendations. Everything came out quickly. Inside decor is beautiful and pleasantly dimly lit. Best place ever.",

    "text": "A scrumptious plate of pasta in Borough Market...I wouldn't say Padella is 'fast' food but for an easy and quick-er plate of really good pasta this place is perfect. With the exception of a handful of cafe tables outside, inside there is only counter space. It makes the most of the small space but also keeps the diners moving along. There is normally a queue but don't let that put you off as the turnover is fairly quick and the staff eager to accommodate diners. The small but tasty menu serves upmarket quality and authentic Italian pasta dishes at bargain prices. I had the Carbonara and it was exceptional. That along with a hearty glass of Nero d'Avola and some antipasto, I was neither rushed or pressured to leave, and left fully satisfied and happy in just over half an hour. Great for the work day lunches or a quick break from shopping at the market. Just all around a fabulous little place.",

Starters, almost forgot, we got beans ! So good and the Burrata of course. How can we not. For drinks two glasses of Italian wine. Cheap and good. Staff is Italian music is on point. Decor is classy yet casual. Would love to have more Seats or a faster turnover to make it a real good alternative to borough market though I am not sure I will do the line again for pastas...",

The server was friendly and encouraged us to order many dishes to try. \"I've ordered six dishes with just me and my friend,\" he says. We ordered 5 pastas between 3 people along with an appetizer and devoured everything. Food: -Burrata: fresh, delicious lightly salted burrata with a light drizzle of olive oil. Order some bread and spread the burrata to enjoy. -Pici cacio & pepe: thick, noodles cooked al dente in a simple oil and pepper sauce. So yummy, you can't stop eating it. \u00a0 -Tagliarini with garlic, chilli, anchovy, capers, tomato & pangrattato: mild spice level, great bite and the flavor combo ate delicious reminded me of a Szechuan style Nicole. It was quite tasty. -Pappardelle with 8 hour Dexter beef shin ragu: the ragu melts in your mouth and the pappardelle is cooked perfectly, lightly sauced , and with topped with salty parmesan. \u00a0 -Duck mezzaluna with sage butter: heavenly duck \"dumpling/ravioli\" little pockets in a buttery sauce with fried sage. \u00a0 \u00a0-Tagliarini with Clams, chilli & lemon: one of the best class pastas I have ever had, so delicate in flavor the star really is the pasta and the flavor adds the perfect harmony to the dish.",

The latter two were definitely stand-outs - don't let their simplicity fool you!!The beef shin ragu was cooked perfectly but its flavor was underwhelming for what it was. The tagliarini was quite good: very buttery and satisfying. The star of the dinner was the pici cacio & pepe, specifically its texture. It's thicker than you'd expect, and it goes perfectly with the light pepper flavor.I got food poisoning from the crab and so would not recommend it... My friend commented that it tasted off but I honestly wasn't sure so I kept eating it! Play it safe with that one.",

We ordered three pasta dishes for my fianc\u00e9 and I because they all looked so good we couldn't choose only two! They were all amazing. Got the lemon tart for dessert which was great too. Would highly recommend this restaurant but would suggest going early to get your name down or reserving a table because by the time we were seated around 8 they weren't even accepting walk ins for the waitlist anymore. We put our names down around 6 then walked around the area, got a drink at the shard and another smaller bar as well to pass the time until they called us. Overall, this place is very reasonably priced, delicious and authentic! Wish I lived in London I would definitely go back!!",

Service is great and everything came out really quickly. I had the peach spritz to drink and it was really refreshing. We started with the bread (baked there, as everything at Padella is homemade!!) and the salame which were both awesome. For pasta we got the gnocchi which was out of this world, fettuccini with tomatoes and garlic, and the Tagliarini. All FRESH pasta and if you don't come here you are missing out!!",

    "text": "Wow. Padella served us the best meal of our trip to London! After coming across them online we were excited to try this place when we were in town for vacation. On a Tuesday evening the wait was about an hour for two people (if you're a single person they can sometimes sneak you in quickly in extra counter spots). We started with bread and burrata both of which were excellent. The waiter asked us if we only wanted one burrata or one each - thinking it would be rediculous to get one each we just decided to share. One bite told us why the waiter asked - delicious! Next time we will each be getting our own. For the main course we got the goat cheese raviolis and the gnocchi. Both were SPECTACULAR. I have rarely had pasta this good. My only regret is that we didn't have more people with us so we could have ordered the whole menu. Highly recommend that you check this place out.",

Not out of the world pasta, but perfect for a good quick meal or intimate little dinner. Not a fan of the seating system though. I don't mind the wait after you put your name down. Just pop on over for a drink next door while your table is ready. The part that is not fun, is waiting after being texted your table is ready. And watching while people who come after you, be seated. Not so fun in the freezing cold. It's not pasta I dream about, but good enough for a visit over if you are in the area! Just mind the bit of wait.

Like many many more, they have my blessing - although I don't know if they need anyone's blessing. Tim Sadatan is a success story and the more I have his food, every time I go, I admire him and his food philosophy even more.There is something very sexy and special about fresh pasta and the long queues that form quickly in front of Padella is proof of this. \u00a0If you have time, it's worth the wait. \u00a0Not too many ingredients go into each dish, but as many have said before, it's the perfect simplicity of the dishes that's the charm. \u00a0On my most recent visit, I resisted the temptation to get the Parpadelle with Beef Shin ragu (easily one of the best pastas in London) and go for the vegetarian option of the Tagliarini with Chiarentana Olive Oil and Parmesan which is a rare thing for me as I simply love meat. After the first bite, I said to myself, yes this is one of those dishes that could convert you into being a vegetarian. \u00a0It was simple but solid and delightful. Just Wow. So yes, it goes without saying that I'm a very big fan of Tim Sadatan. \u00a0However, the queues although they do move considerably quickly and guests are normally thoughtful and nice enough to have the common sense to not take too long so that other people in the queue can also have the delicious pasta, the wait could take as long as an hour or more. \u00a0If you are in a rush, especially if you're travelling and you don't have time to queue for Padella, La Tua Pasta which serves fresh raviolis is not a bad alternative to fall back on. \u00a0In fact, their raviolis are super delicious and is a couple of minutes walk away from Padella. \u00a0Or, if you must sample Tim Sadatan's dishes and you want certainty with timing, why not make a reservation at Trullo? You can sample the pastas there and also taste other non-pasta goodies.",

Turns out he had underestimated how popular it would be- as it is on the other side of where I stay when in London it was a problem I would re-create twice before I finally got to make it in... They don't take reservations, but you can show up early and be added to the list. The food was amazing- for the cost, and the flavor, and the excellent staff once sat- I have no complaints. In the end, through coordination, we managed to get a table for five of us- and not one person had a complaint. That alone is deserving of high praise. But when you start comparing the people at the table and their taste in food (some who would eat no meat, some who would eat no vegetables, others avoid sugar or alcohol) it is amazing that everyone was so happy. I eat a lot of Italian meals. This place ranks as one of the best I have ever had and I look forward to when I will make it back again.",

He was very aggressive and yelled to get out because there's a waitlist. Ok fine, couldn't he just explain that in a normal tone instead of acting like a Neanderthal. Especially since there was no visible line formed by the entrance, instead it was started around the corner of the building to keep the sidewalk clear. The restaurant should care more about having their employees act civil. No need for such rudeness. Anyways they can keep their pasta, I have Il Corvo and Spinasse here in Seattle, both have fabulous pasta and great customer service.",

I came around 5:00pm and there was already a line. Luckily I got seated not too long after. My date and I got one burrata to start and four pastas to share. We were stuffed but figured we should try more items on the menu since we probably won't come back and wait in line for 2 hours for a table. The pastas were absolutely delicious. It's simple and full of flavour. Our favourite was the Pici. The texture, aroma and flavour were just excellent. You won't regret coming. Plus, pricing is very reasonable ranging from 4 to 12 pounds a dish.Tagliarini with Dorset crab, lemon and chilli 4/5Pici with majoram, lemon and golden garlic 5/5Pappardelle with beef chin ragu 3/5Tagliarini with olive oil and Parmesan 5/5",

Service is quick, and they have a ton of tables (including seating in the basement, which is way cooler).That said, we never felt rushed throughout our meal.We started out with sourdough bread, Wiltshire burrata, and seaweed salame. The burrata was wonderful, but the salame was the star of the show. In fact, once the guy at the table next to us saw our salame (no innuendo intended), we heard him ask the waiter what it was and also ordered the same thing (despite his girlfriend being a vegetarian). Yeah, it was *that* good.For my main, I went with the papardelle with 8 hour dexter beef shin ragu, which was amazing. My friend went with the fettuccine with artichokes. The plates aren't that big, but they're also not at all pricey either (from \u00a34 to \u00a310.50).So we actually decided to get another order of sourdough bread, and split the gnocchi with sage and nutmeg butter. The gnocchi was also great. They also pile on the shaved parmesan, which is always a plus.We washed it all down with some carafes of wine (on tap), which were actually the most expensive part of the meal, but well worth it.Loved Padella, and would definitely recommend it to everyone who loves pasta!",

We were concerned that we may have to sit at the bar, making it difficult to talk. It is fairly loud and hectic inside of the restaurant, but this is part of the atmosphere. We were instead seated at a booth and it was the perfect spot! We ordered salads which were large, burrata and bread which was incredible, and a few different pasta options. Couldn't not recommend this restaurant more! The food is very inexpensive, especially for the quality and freshness. The pasta is made fresh to order and you can definitely tell the difference. After our travels to Italy, this restaurant is definitely true Italian. Wish this restaurant was closer to our home as we would be here all the time! Only recommendation would be to get there as close to their opening as possible. You have to wait on the que just to put your name on the waitlist. They do close the que/waitlist once it is full.

Sat right in the heart of the action at the bar that is perfectly situated in the assembly line of the kitchen. \u00a0Even though there was a lot of hustle and bustle around me, I felt like I had the whole place to myself in some strange way. Seeing as it's as fast-casual as you can be for Italian but still dons the affluence of a white tablecloth Italian restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised at the prices (very fair, even before factoring in the quality of the ingredients and presentation).I started with the burrata and bread and a glass of wine and both were a beautiful start to the meal. I wanted to inhale every last crumb of the bread basket, but tried to maintain some kind of decorum since I still had my entree on the horizon. If there's not a line and you're not terribly hungry, I'd recommend popping in for just that little amuse bouche. I had a hard time deciding between the 4-5 main pasta dishes but push came to shove and I went with their Pici Cacio & Pepe, as that is what brought me to this particular establishment in the first place. While not a hefty dish, it was the ideal amount of pasta given that the sauce is super decadent. I savored each bite and extended the meal into a two hour tour (given that they close from 4-5pm everyday so I wasn't handicapping the seat for another eager diner). I thoroughly enjoy a lot of pepper in my cacio & Pepe dishes, but appreciated the subtly of theirs given that they wanted to showcase the flavor profile of the sauce without having to lean on the flakes for good measure.Service was delightful and if I'm not mistaken, most of the front of house was Italian, making the experience even more authentic feeling.(In using the restroom, I happened upon a downstairs dining area, so the place is bigger than it lets on from the exterior).",

And the next day I arrived 30 minutes before open and got a decent place in line. It was nice to sit at the bar and have a front row view of the kitchen. Lots of fresh artichokes being cut, fresh made pasta being prepped and plates being served up. It's action packed.Pear Spritz while I waited. Bubbly, fruity and an alcohol finish. Refreshing to sip on. \u00a0Ordered Papardelle in Dexter beef shin ragu. The menu indicates the ragu has been stewing for 8 hours, making the beef almost melt into the sauce. However, I was surprised and slightly disappointed with the sauce. I would have preferred a more savory umami quality to the ragu. Small beef shreds and thinner tomato sauce seem to appeal to a lighter palate. Generous pile of Parmesan grated on-top offers some cheese tang and richness. Fresh ground peppercorns add nuance. \u00a0 However, the pasta itself is the star. Perfectly cooked with al-dente texture. Smooth, dense and a pleasure to eat. No question that this is made by hand with love. If I'm in the area again I might return to try a different pasta dish.",

    "text": "Yum! I had seen Padella on Instagram and knew that I had to visit when I was in London for the summer. Listen to other reviewers -- I went on a Tuesday night at 5:30 and still had to wait in line for about a half an hour. I was not deterred by this as the pasta was delicious, but definitely get there early to be seated. They cut off the line at a certain point and trust me you don't want to miss out!The pasta is handmade and fresh. We ordered the crab special, the beef ragu, the burrata, and gnocchi. The beef ragu stood out the most to me. I would 100% order this again. \u00a0The crab special and gnocchi were good, but I wouldn't be in a hurry to go back for them. I also found the burrata to be delicious.While all the food was delicious, I don't think we needed three pastas and the burrata between 2 people. While at the price point it was definitely a bargain, we just didn't need that much food. I'd suggest either two pastas and the burrata or just three pastas without the burrata.Four stars because while the meal was delicious, I am not running to go back immediately.",

That line took an hour on a Friday evening. We then put our name down and they said it'll be another hour from then! We killed time across the street at a coffee shop and came back and it was SO SO worth it.First of all, AMAZINGLY priced for such phenomenal taste and great portions!!Burrata was 10/10! The cacio e Pepe was phenomenal - that's what I usually sample! My sister had ravioli which is what she always gets, and said it was the best she's had! For dessert, we didn't know what to expect from the almond and fig tart, but it was AMAZING. We were wishing we had ordered another to share between 3 people!We wanted to go back again the next day, but decided we should sample more places in London during the visit! We'll 100% be back the next time we're in the city, though!",

Don't be fooled, the line wraps behind the building so you can't see it from the front. \u00a0We were seated at ~12:35 after the restaurant opened at noon. The service was so friendly and accommodating, and every dish was perfection. They recommend three pastas between two people, but with the burrata appetizer (which was also not to miss) we would have been very happy with two total pasta dishes to share. Don't miss the bolognese and the salt and pepper pasta that everyone seems to get. They were our faves! \u00a0The surrounding Borough Market provides a great atmosphere for post or pre-meal perusing and sauntering.",

We stood in line for maybe 20-30 min to put our name down and was told we will get a table around 7:30-8, and this is on a weekday ladies and gentlemen! When we finally got seated we were excited to try their fresh pastas. Price is very reasonable for London standards. My boyfriend ordered the papperdelle with 8 hours beef ragu, absolutely delicious and I think I would have preferred that because it has a lot of meat in it. I ordered the pici which was delicious too and very different in flavours than any pasta I have had before. It was refreshing because of the lemony flavour but no meat.Overall great pastas and I will visit again if I am in London.",

The papardelle with bolognese sauce (about \u00a38) was particularly favored at our table, but for \u00a34, the gnocchi is an affordable main to supplement, and supply sufficient carbs to climb the hundreds of stairs at nearby St. Paul's. But as a critic, I did find flaws. Despite being very busy (by 12:30 the wait is already 49 minutes, so arrive at noon!), service was unnecessarily slow and inattentive (hard to get check, a bottle of water, attention, etc). Also the \"330ml\" drafts seemed nowhere near that size - I'd like the \"royal weights and measures\" referee to judge.",

    "text": "This was recommended to me by my AirBnB host, and the reviews here are great. We were told to come 15 minutes before opening to beat the line, but knowing me, I came 15 minutes AFTER opening, and jeez the line was already winding around the restaurant, with a few curves here and there. Judging by how long the line was, I estimated it to be about a 2 hour wait, so we decide to come back at around 3-5pm when people would be at work or something.Come 3:15pm, and lo and behold, no line at all. At that point we were already crazy full from sampling the amazing street food of London, but I knew I had to make room for the pasta. The restaurant is actually pretty big, as they have a basement level as well. We got the burrata to start, and for the pasta we got the cacio e Pepe, and the olive oil tagliarini. The burrata was great, but I was super full already. I wish it came with some tomatoes, bread, or even some balsamic, as eating it as just cheese was a little bit gross. I do maintain that it was excellent burrata, but I wish it had a little more to balance it out.The pasta was AMAZING. I think they have some of the best pasta outside of Italy (and I live in Brooklyn where there's mad Italians so we have some pretty decent pasta back home). The noodles here were a PERFECT AL DENTE. Each noddle was springy and had a great bite to it. What makes the dish however, is the sauce. THE SAUCE. AMAZING. They don't do none of that cream or cornstarch nonsense - this is some good oil-pasta water emulsion going on. The sauce coated each individual noodle perfectly. I literally licked the plate because the sauce was that good (no shame). Even my friend, who is never impressed with my food choices, loved his pasta.Overall, you HAVE TO COME HERE. It's well worth the wait, but I highly recommend coming here around 3pm for a mid day snack, after lunch snack, pre dinner snack, or just a snack. Who cares. One person can comfortably eat 1.5 pasta plates here, so order a few more! My only regret is that I wish I had more room in my stomach to try a few more of their pastas.AND ITS DIRT CHEAP HERE.",

The handmade fresh pasta is delicious and they have a rotating menu. Price wise, it was between 7-12 GBP per plate, which is pretty good by London standards. The atmosphere is loud, and everyone is in a hurry to serve customers. Service was quick, can't say it is amazing but it certainly feels like a well oiled machine so that it is quick to turnover tables. For me, I probably won't return unless I had a visitor that insists on going. Although the wait for me this time wasn't so bad, I think it is pretty typical to wait at least 2 hours for a table. The restaurant is a bit to busy and loud. Although the pasta is delicious, there is another pasta place (close by) that I'd like to think serve the same quality of handmade pasta with a rotating menu, at a similar price point, and all without the extreme wait in a little more intimate setting.",

Unfortunately, they didn't have the crab pasta which I wanted, so I had an alternative with brown prawns in it. It was a bit zesty for my taste, but still fresh and flavourful. All the other pasta dishes were phenomenal, and my favourite was the pici (spelling?) which my friend had. Service was really good and prompt, despite it being very busy. The staff made time to check up on us and chat with us as well, whilst we watched the World Cup on our screen. We were seated downstairs, where the space was decent. Casual and down to earth, and I loved the open kitchen and being able to see pasta being made.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were walking around London when we saw a huge line for Padella. This piqued our curiosity, so we decided to check it out for lunch the following day. We went for a late lunch, not too long before they closed and the place was still packed. Despite being the only ones in line, we still had a bit of a wait and were nearly turned away. However, we lucked out and were able to snag a spot at the bar. We ordered the beef shin rag\u00f9, as we read many rave reviews about it, and we also selected the fettuccine with tomatoes, garlic & basil. Both were absolutely wonderful and on par with the pasta we had all throughout Italy in the past. The best part was that it was pretty inexpensive for a meal in London. Don't let the line at Padella intimidate you. It is well worth the wait!",

    "text": "Absolutely worth the wait! I heard about this place from watching a YouTube clip about foods in borough market so I had to try it myself. There was a queue on a Friday afternoon, but I got a table with a friend within 30-45 min. The place is pretty small, but if you're lucky you can sit at the counter where you can watch the pasta dishes being cooked. There were about 5-6 different types of pasta dishes ranging from gnocchi to linguini with mussels. The pasta dishes ranged from \u00a34.50-10.50.My friend and I ordered 3 pasta dishes- gnocchi with basic cream sauce, linguini with baby mussels and this thick pasta in a beef ragout. The pasta dishes were all AMAZING! The sauce of the gnocchi wasn't overwhelming and the pasta was soft tender pillows. The linguini dish had a light sauce flavoured by the mussels and had no fishy after taste. The thick pasta with the beef ragout was absolutely amazing. The sauce was thick and rich from the meat stock. Overall this place delivered and met my expectations. The price was decent and the flavours were amazing!",

Although the wait was super long (we signed up for the waitlist around 5:30 and got seated around 7), it was definitely worth it. The pasta noodles were cooked to perfection and although not too flavorful or seasoned, the dishes were made just right. We ordered 4 different pasta dishes for the 3 of us, and we still wanted more!For the price and quality, it is definitely a must visit place in London.",

All of the food here is extremely good, quick and cheap. We were shocked by the prices, after having eaten out at a lot of other places in Europe.For antipasti, we ordered the Crostini, the Burrata and the sourdough bread with the oil (which is a must with the burrata because you don't get any bread with the burrata). The crostini was something else - the ricotta cheese was extremely flavorful and rich and the tomatoes added a nice touch. The bread wasn't too hard as well. The burrata and bread were also extremely good, although it doesn't have the same strong taste as the Crostini. Definitely make sure to mix some oil on each bite of bread you take. For the main course, I ordered the Pici dish and really enjoyed it. The sauce is a bit salty but has great texture and is just the right amount of creamy. The pasta is also very well cooked and has a soft texture and goes great with the sauce. I also ordered the Pear Spritz drink which was extremely refreshing. It has a little bitterness to it, but it is well carbonated and sweet. The slice of grapefruit at the end is also a nice touch. For dessert, we split the chocolate sorbet and it was heavenly. It is like rich dark chocolate ice cream that is not as bitter as you would expect. It was honestly too much food at that point, but still well worth it. Considering the price, this is easily one of the best pasta places I've been to.",

Our place was a 10 minute walk from here and since they didn't take reservations, I figured it might be easier to get in than other places I had wanted to try.There was a line of about 10 people when we got there but we were kind of jet lagged so we just stood in the line like zombies and didn't mind, and also, the line moved pretty quickly. We got three different kind of pastas. I got the short rib tagliatelle and the caccio e pepe. The salt and pepper bucatini was one of the best dishes I ever ate. Hands down. I was trying to figure out how many more times I could come back and order it. Such a great way to start our vacation in London. The staff was great and the space was small and cozy but not cramped. Half of the seating is around the actual kitchen making the pastas to order, which was where we sat every time we went there. They had two beers on tap and they had a great burrata that came with olive oil which was delicious. We also ordered their sourdough bread which really tasted great with the burrata. The food that they make is just amazing. I can't believe that we don't have any restaurants comparable in the US. Every single dish I had was delicious and I never ate one thing that was just meh. I gained about 10 pounds on my vacation and most of that was due to Padella.",

    "text": "So I have seen a lot of recent reviews about this place. It is obviously the new kid on the block to a certain degree, so all reviewers and bloggers are getting involved. As I am a regular in London bridge, I had passed this place a lot and never got the opportunity to go in as I was put off by the queues. So Lobos nearby took got cash. Finally we decided that we need to bite the bullet and see what all of the fuss is about. We settled in the queue on a Wednesday after a drink at the lovely Globe Tavern nearby. We queued for one hour and 10 minutes. At no point did anyone come out, work the queue, acknowledge us, write a name on a clip board, walk by with some tasters, nowt. You just stood in that queue having no inclination as to how long this would become your temporary home. I have worked in the service industry, so I disagree that this should be the norm. You could walk up, take names and party numbers. Even if you had no intention of closely monitoring the activity inside to see how soon a table would become free, its a psychological thing. It gives people the impression that there is light at the end of the tunnel. That simple interaction. I think I, like others, had bought into the current buzz that surrounds this place, so against my better nature, there I was, in a queue. When we were finally seated inside, we are guided to a basement. Outside you don't know there is additional space. We at at the bar in a cramped corner, but were delighted to start our food journey. The menu is small and simple. In the queue we could hear those who felt like Padella experts discuss the menu and the dishes, what dishes you MUST have, scrolling through various instagram, google and twitter images. We wanted to take a leap of faith and just grab what we fancied. The service was OK. It was rushed. Not rude, but certainly not warm. We ordered two glasses of prosecco from the bartender a mulled over our dinner options to his disdain. I just didn't immediately get it. This was his opportunity to say, hey, what don't you guys get that, partner it with this and have a hit of that. He worked there, he knew the menu, he could have helped. Instead, he leaned over the bar to us, arms on the surface, waiting for us to order so he could move on to slicing bread, making drinks and serving up desserts. We both went for the buratta as this seems to be my \"must have\". Maybe I should just start a buratta blog as I am intrigued by this dish and how many variation there are of it (stingy to plentiful - Padella was midway). For main we went for spaghetti with tomato sauce and also fettuccine with chilli (nduja). With a side of sourdough bread, we expected to be full up. I think our naivety on the menu showed as our choices were not the best. I am not sure we got the full effect of Padella. To be frank, the food was just okay. Whilst Lobos blew our mind with their Spanish tapas, Italian landed with a wet thud. I know there is a connection to this place to another joint which is apparently good in Islingon, but I like to judge things on their own, individual merits. \u00a0Following little interaction with the team, we paid up our bill and left feeling a little deflated. Our one hour plus wait had produced a 35 minute mediocre dining experience.",

    "text": "I came here with three friends last night, looking for a cheap dinner and a good catch up, and as we are all good friends, it wasn't awkward to queue for the 30 or so minutes that it takes to get a table. I was surprised by how good the location is - it is literally right by the tube station and Borough Market - and you can't miss the queue. Once inside, initially we were offered four seats by the window on the ground floor, but my friend who had been to the restaurant before insisted that we wait for one of the tables downstairs, where you can actually get a table and have proper conversation. Upstairs it is mostly bar seating, so more ideal for 2 people than for larger groups. Also, once downstairs, you don't feel the pressure of having the entire queue watch you through the window. The one thing I found very strange is that either they are not very good at efficiently filling tables, or they are purposely keeping tables empty downstairs so that they keep a long queue outside (much like a club). The entire bar downstairs was empty when we came in, and while we were dining there were at least 2 other tables that were vacated and left empty. On the other hand, service was excellent, so it is possible that they were just understaffed and didn't want to seat more people than they could properly serve, but then again that would be another problem they should solve.The menu is pleasantly simple with about 6 choices of antipasti and another 6 choices of pasta. My friend who had dined here previously said the antipasti was rather missable, so we went ahead and ordered 6 pastas. Service was really quick, and they were all brought to the table at the same time. There was a special with girolle mushrooms, and on top of that we got a tagliarini with raw courgette and prawns, the ricotta ravioli with sage butter, the pappardelle with beef shin ragu, the pici cacao e pepe, and the tagliatelle with nduja and parsley. Of those, my favourite was the one with girolle mushrooms and the beef shin ragu. The tagliatelle with nduja was far too spicy for my enjoyment. The other one that was a little underwhelming was the tagliarini with raw courgette and prawns - the prawns were no bigger than the size of your nail and the dish was light and lacked flavour. For dessert, we shared both the almond / rhubarb and chocolate tart, which were both delicious. We also enjoyed the merlot from Vini Stocco, which for the 500ml size basically made for four glasses, so we got two. It was decent, but I wouldn't be in a rush to have it again. After our meal, we lingered a while longer, and the staff was in no hurry to get us to leave, despite the sizeable queue still outside. I'm kind of convinced this is just a huge marketing ploy. I would recommend people go to Trullo, where you can have the exact same dishes in a nice setting without the queue.",

Would def give it another go if in the area, but hopefully a few more interesting choices on the menu.",

    "text": "Holy delicious pasta!!! Well worth the 40 minute wait.My friend and I split three dishes- tagliatelle with Dorset crab, ricotta ravioli and tagliatelle with nduja sausage. The crab pasta was citrusy and light, delicate but flavoursome. The sausage pasta had a delightful kick to it, lots of spice and tangy tomato sauce. But the real deal pasta was the ravioli....oh...my...goodness! Creamy with sage sauce and buttery and sinful and pasta as delicate as you like. We also split the chocolate tart which was rich and smooth with a perfect crust. A real triumph, and great value for the quality of food. Friendly staff and great atmosphere, a winner!",

    "text": "I pass by every week and there's a queue out the door (in fact, as I'm writing this a queue has formed. Prescient!) Anyway, since there was no queue today I figured why not try it out. I'm happy I did! The prices are reasonable, as are the portion sizes - well, for London. In the USA I would be outraged. I had a tagatelle with asparagus and it was great. Not just great, but quick too. The staff here is super friendly, and I could easily eat here every time I'm in the area if there's no queue. What is with this city and queuing out the door? Why must we queue for anything nice? Am I not people too?!?",

The lack of ability to make bookings is a shame, means you have to wait ages for a table if you dont want to eat super early.",
