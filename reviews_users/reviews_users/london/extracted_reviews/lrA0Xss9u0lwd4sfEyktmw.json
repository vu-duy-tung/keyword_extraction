    "text": "It's a long story how we ended up by St Paul's at 10:00 PM so I won't go into it but it worked out well. We were looking for a late night bite when most places were closed and we came across Cafe Rouge. We were greeted by the manager and seated in a cozy corner with a perfect view of St Paul's Cathedral, lit up by spotlights just across the block.I always love a damn good steak frites and upon the server's recommendation, we both ordered the Bavette steak, cooked rare as suggested. The steak had a nice flavor although it was a tad tough. I would have preferred it to be a little more tender but still not bad. We moved on to desert for the Crepe Chocolat Banane. It was a gooey-chocalate frenzy of bananas and chocolate over crepes. It was paired nicely with a cafe latte.The service here was one of the best features. We were checked on frequently by both the server and manager who made sure our meal was pleasant. It was near closing time but we didn't feel like we were being rushed by any means. Overall, Cafe Rouge was a nice finish to our evening on a night when our plans had been abruptly changed. I saw a few other Cafe Rouge's around London so I'd certainly be happy to return again.",

Ghastly, uninspired food with service to match ( note to the chain: you don't HAVE to be an insouciant waiter in a French restaurant). Real end of the pier experience.

There is the restaurant part of the place and the bar side of it. Though the restaurant tables were empty, me and my friends couldn't be seated (we only wanted some drinks) and had to wait long minutes until some other, generous customers finished their drinks and let us sit down at their table.

Directly across the street from St Paul's Cathedral, you have stunning views of the cathedral. And you can simultaneously laugh at all of the crazy tourist groups.Our meal was delivered QUICK QUICK QUICK and pretty decent. I have the chicken and roquefort salad (hold the roquefort, of course) while the g-ma enjoyed a cured meats platter (salami and prosciutto with pate, bread, and gherkins). Even though it was bustling during the lunch rush, it wasn't too loud or crazy in there, and the waitstaff managed to keep up.Another approval for the Rouge.",

The view of St. Paul's cathedral can't be beat!They offer a prix-fixe (is that spelled right?) menu for lunch, about \u00a310-$12. Had the pate and bread, followed by a nice pork sausage and the meltiest-in-my-mouth mashed potatoes, with au jus. I think I licked my plates clean. With an espresso, lunch came out to ~\u00a314. Awesome deal!Also on the lunch menu was Beef Bourgoinogne, which the French girl who ordered it at the next table said was absolutely divine.Service was prompt, friendly but not overbearing. Check out Black's outdoor goods store nearby; they sell cute Wellington-type boots for cheap (~\u00a325)!Makes me wish they had Cafe Rouge stateside!",

But it was still so good! \u00a0We came here for dinner and tried a few appetizers and the Confit de Canard, with tarte tatin for desserts. The duck was delicious, and the plum sauce was actually sweet and the perfect contrast for the savory duck. The tarte tatin just needed a little more ice cream, but it was done just right. I'd had a similar duck in plum sauce at a more expensive place in Zurich and I have to say this was much, much better. The only thing is, service took forever. I know we Americans like to eat and run instead of having a nice, relaxed, European dinner. the problem wasn't that we wanted to go at a different pace, it was that the waiters kept ignoring us no matter what we did to catch their attention - we'd make eye contact, smile, wave, and they would see us, but no one would come over to see what we wanted. The restaurant was clearly half empty, but for some reason nobody wanted to come help us out. When we mentioned it to one of the servers, he was very apologetic and took our order and made sure it came out promptly, but getting the check was a problem all over again. So, -1 star for all the stress.",

    "text": "Cafe Rouge is located in front of St Paul's ... very close to where i live. I was at home the whole of sunday evening and so went to this \"local\" french restaurant for dinner.I was pleasantly surprised by the interior of the restaurant. It was brightly lit, colourful, and the walls were decorated with pictures and posters ... of \u00a0the kind i associate with a cafe in Paris. This cheered me up a bit :)I ordered the 2 course fixed price menu (~\u00a312). As a starter i asked for the chicken liver parfait. I love this dish and i think i have ordered it in every meal where i have found it on the menu. Having the soft meat on bread with french butter ... sipping some delicious white wine on the side ... i can't get enough of it :)For the main course i ordered a small medium to well done steak. The steak as well as the chips was good. They served it with dilute garlic sauce which i thought was an unusual choice. But i think the server didn't take down my order correctly. The meat i got was more medium-rare than well done. But it was fine. I enjoyed the food.One reason why i am deducting one star is that Cafe Rouge is a stickler for time. They close at 2230 on sundays and they turn away customers even if they arrive only a minute after the time. Thats the reason why it took me so long to dine here ... i have left disappointed twice and i saw others being turned away as i ate this sunday. In my opinion they should be slightly more flexible in this regard.Cafe Rouge seems to be a pretty nice place to get cheap french food (\u00a315 for two courses and a glass of wine). I will almost certainly come back during slow weekends. But for special occasions there are many better places that i can recommend.",

Having said that, you get the usual middle-of-the-road Cafe Rouge food, which is handy when you fancy something quick but not junk-y, and the service is generally very pleasant.

I immediately indicated that it would not be acceptable and could they recook the order.

Our cappuccinos were served promptly and sprinkled with just the right amount of cocoa, a nice surprise. We both got the pineapple tarte as well and it was the perfect afternoon pick me up. A great place to stop in for a quick bite or just a coffee.",

The staff was lovely and very quick. \u00a0The prices are average for London, even on the cheaper side I would say. The afternoon tea was WONDERFUL! You may have tea or coffee and a sweet cake. \u00a0We sat by the window and enjoyed the view and people watching. It was one of the most relaxing parts of our trip.",

They have an afternoon tea set with coffee & a French cake for only \u00a34.5 Lovely restaurant, with open windows, overlooking St. Paul cathedral. Loved the decor! I totally enjoyed sitting at the window table, people watching & having my 'white coffee' & chocolate cake. For that price it's a steal! They were busy even at 4pm...service very good, very French !",

We had the Lobster bisque, the Plateau a partager ( board of charcuterie, olives, p\u00e2t\u00e9, soft goats' cheese, rocket and a selection of bread with d'Isigny butter) and the holy trinity dessert. Washed down, of course, with wine. Because of all the reasons. The lobster bisque was so dreamy. Like Colin Firth in The Bridget Jones diaries. Sweet, steamy, intense, rich, creamy as fuck, respectful and loves you for who you really are! I didn't think anything could top this, until I had a lusty love affair with the pate. I've never known pate like this, I was living in the dark 'till it came along and showed me what true pate tastes like. It had such complex, complete flavours, 5 dimensions all in one bite! His core, grounded, meaty flavour, the base that then sustains the sweetness, and then the lightness, and then the perfume! Oh, the perfume! And the texture! It was like cutting into cheesecake, creamy, airy, layered! Imagine this: a slice of baguette- crusty outside, soft inside, cut in a big, inviting chunk, drizzle that with melted butter with garlic and herbs, then top with the pate. I got dizzy at one point. For the dessert we had miniature tarte tatin, tarte au citron and fondant aux chocolats. Even though I wasn't blown away by this (not sure I even had the capacity at this point) it was all good. It was the perfect ending to a decadent meal.",

Whodathunkit...Good French cuisine at Olive Garden or Chilis prices! Our waitress Fran was delightful and her menu recommendations were perfect. Anyone used to the routine rudeness of Parisians or the attitude of a typical Manhattan French restaurant maitre'd would be very pleasantly surprised by the charm and warmth of the French hostess who seated us on both our visits. By the way, this is pretty typical of French restaurants in the UK. My wife and I joke that all the most friendly and customer-service oriented people in France get deported to Britain on the Eurostar train from Paris to London.",
