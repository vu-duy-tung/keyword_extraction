    "text": "I visit London often and find Wagamama to be one of the most relaiable and reasonable meals in thervice UK. Service is quick and always find something I like on their menu. I am not a big fan of curry, however I tried the chicaken katsu curry based on a recommendation \u00a0of a friend. I did like it because it is Asian curry and a very mild curry. The new pork rib appetizer is good, pork gyoza, and I like many of their noodle dishes. They even deliver to many areas of London. On one freezing night I was happy to order and get delivery. I like this new location at the Tower of London as most of the places around there are somewhat touristy. Free Green tea with your meal as well.",

Plenty of king prawns, tonnes of chili, nice sticky rice (not too tricky to pick up with chopsticks) and veg. Washed down with two large glasses of ginger beer. Icing on the cake, so to speak, was the white chocolate cheesecake with toffee chili sauce. Awesome.",

They have lost my business. The food was good but forget any service.This was the Wagama in Spitalfields. \u00a0One star for the food because the service was so bad and that spoils the enjoyment of the food.

It's tasty and inexpensive and the portions are huge, green tea is free, miso is warm, and so on. But what's exceptional about this particular location are the view (tourists and locals alike can enjoy looking out over the Tower and surrounding courtyard) and the incredibly friendly service. I don't think I had a more polite server during my entire trip to visit friends in London. The staff was attentive without making me feel watched or uncomfortable, food was brought out in a timely fashion but without coming too quickly for us to enjoy conversation, and even though we arrived a mere hour before close, we never felt rushed. I'm not usually the sort to really enjoy major chain restaurants but Wagamama appears to be one very quality exception to the rule.",

The pad Thai was so so and was the only thing worth eating. For an appetizer, we ordered pork dumplings/gyoza. When it says pork dumplings, it is literally ONLY pork, no vegetables at all to make the filling tasty. It melted in my mouth, and not in a good way.

Let's just say I am quite disappointed about this place. The curry was average and the yaki soba noodles were not good at all. The flavor was bland and I am not talking about the amount of salt they put in the dishes. Wagamama definitely does not have authentic dishes. Although, if there is a Wagamama nearby and I'm hungry, I would stop here to eat something if there is nothing else around. Wagamama is also overpriced.

After a mediocre Wagamana experience near the British Museum (blandest and grossest-colored \"curry\" I have ever experienced), I gave this place a second chance. Nope, it wasn't just that particular branch. At this branch I ordered the Ginger Chicken Udon. The first bite I took assaulted my palate with this really unappealing bitter taste. It was such an unattractive dish, so carelessly prepared, with just random bits of this and that, including RAW onions, random unidentifiable string-like scraps, and DARK meat. If you're gonna serve dark meat, you should really put that on the menu, because I don't know anyone who would willingly order it. The chicken just wasn't good. They do give you a lot of food, which is good for value, but not if that food isn't great.",

I consider myself a spice lover, but this was way out of my realm. Like I said, the flavor was great, so if not for the immense spice, it would be a five-star dish. It seems like instead of listing it as \"spicy,\" the menu should have classified it as \"very spicy.\" Everyone else in my six-person party enjoyed their food, so the spice in my dish is the only thing holding it back from a five-star review.",

There must be an asian person involved in creating the menus and recipes for the corporation. From what I could tell there is probably about one asian person per square mile in this area of London. And that person did not work at Wagamama.We don't do fish and chips very well here on Oahu. Wagamama doesn't do ramen justice.Seriously mediocre ramen. Little bit better chicken katsu. Better yakisoba.Better to avoid the ramen unless you just have to have a noodle fix.The place itself is nice with modern decor, cafeteria style seating, free green tea, high energy staff, clean and fresh food. I like the fact that you can order from a smart phone app or computer for take out. I'm giving them 3.5 stars for trying so hard to be modern and high tech. The food is actually good but the taste is way off from what were are accustomed to. It is definitely worth one visit to see if it suits you better than it did us.",

The restaurant is downstairs so don't worry if it feels like you are walking through a door to nowhere under the sign! We also tried the location by the Tower of London- apparently stories of treason and royal intrigue make me just as hungry as the mummies- this one is in a big modern building above the ticket office with big windows an nice view. Both have cafeteria seating which makes it really good for large groups. I was first introduced in '06 by my professors who take their study abroad kids here every trip, and they must be doing something right because the chain has spread all over the city!!",

They offer free green tea and the rest of their dishes are a pretty decent value. Great place to stop if you want to grab a quick bite.",

Both were nothing crazy outstanding, but they were delicious and definitely hit the spot. We also shared an appetizer of chicken wings seasoned in an \"Asian\" way.Service is seriously quick and the staff is really nice. Seating is arranged in long tables where you may end up sitting next to some strangers, but luckily we were there at a non-busy hour so we had lots of space to ourselves.",

The servers are very friendly and quick and the view of the tower and bridge is great.

I don't remember if it had other things. I tried their duck bibimbap which was actually pretty tasty, their pork buns which was pretty mediocre... and their duck wings which I liked, but had too many tiny shards of bones.

Two items that caught my attention that particular night was the Lollipop Prawns and the Grilled Duck Donburi. The Lollipop Prawns were so good I actually hesitated in sharing with my friends. The Grilled Duck Donburi was not a disappointment either. It came with shredded duck meat, mixed vegetables, topped with a sunny side up egg and a side of kimchi. Even though it's a donburi it was more like a bibimbap in my opinion. My friend ordered the ramen and was disappointed because the soup was not warm enough. \u00a0 The prices are reasonable considering the location. They're right next to Tower Bridge and the Tower of London. If you get seated next to the window you can get a beautiful view of both of those landmarks. The downfall of this particular Wagamama location is their service. The host was great but the waiters are very inattentive. It must've took around 15 minutes before the waiter came over to take our orders. Even after our orders it took him a long time to get our beverages. How long does it take to prepare green tea? The waiter also never cared to check up on us to ask if we were satisfied with our meals. Even when it was time for the bill it took awhile before we could wave him over to our table. Wagamama I definitely like your food but the lack of customer service usually leaves a \"bad taste\" in your customer's mouth.",

After a day at The Tower of London, we came across Wagamama. My cousin had mentioned that the food at this chain was good and we should check this place out, so off we went. The place was very crowded and loud. Servers were running about hectically. The service was lacking and was more at the caliber of uncaring fast food workers. However, the food here was good though it was more fusion than authentic. We all ordered \u00a0different variations of ramen noodles. \u00a0We all chose the chicken broth and I like that the broth here isn't overly salty nor too rich/thick. It was light but flavorful. One bizarre incident here was that our server brought over a portable credit card device to insert my credit card. After doing so, the screen asked if I wanted to leave a tip and if so how much. our server was hovering over me while holding the device for me to complete the transaction! Tacky but I felt compelled to leave a tip.",

It was very non-traditional, as one would expect at a fusion type restaurant. The food tasted fresh and was well prepared with a very nice serving size. The curry was like a masala mixed with pad thai over rice. They did have pad thai here but I wanted to try something different. I was satisfied with the food.

The only dude who smiled, was polite, and gave two craps about us was not even our real waiter. He was the guy who worked there but realized we were being ignored so came to offer help. His name, you ask? I don't know. But he told us he is expecting his first baby boy. He was genuine, kind, helpful, and your best representation. Our waitress was rude. Didn't care to bring me a straw for my water when I asked for it. Ignored my request for individual small plates so that the four of us could share appetizers, and never offered to refill our water NOT EVEN ONCE. I realize now (according to my brother in law) that no one really tips in the UK because people supposedly get paid better than waiters/waitresses in the USA but there is some common decent customer service. This is ridiculous. My pad Thai came out last, at least ten min after everyone else. Then the man who brought out the food was argumentative and said that they bring the food out when it's done one at a time and failed to acknowledge that maybe my plate had just been sitting there waiting to be brought to me but that no one noticed from their staff. The duck gyozawas OK. The lollipop shrimp was great. My pad Thai was awful. I had to ask for four extra limes to drown the awful flavor. It had a lot of veggies but really did not taste like any pad Thai I've ever had. One more time: Wagamama, take some time to learn these famous words from the amazing Amy Winehouse (RIP) \"you know, that I'm no good.\"",

It's a biggish chain. \u00a0Hadn't tried other locations but thought this location was solid enough. \u00a0Good hearty Asian fusion noodle bar.",

We've had better but in all the food was decently seasoned with fair sized portions. Service was okay. Not great but not terrible. We probably would eat here again.",

    "text": "Wagamama means to be \"selfish/spoiled\" in Japanese (usually referring to as a child). There's nothing to be spoiled about eating here, but I guess the name still fits because you'll find out the food is horrible and the restaurant can call you by its name. LOLIt was across from Tower of London, so I just settled here. I was not expecting much going in, but I just wanted to see the quality. Wagamama seems to be like the McDonald's of \"Japanese\" ramen in London... it's all over the place. I believe they're more Thai taste than Japanese. They are Chinese owned. I tried the Wagamama ramen, which contains all sorts of stuff: grilled chicken, barbecued pork, egg, onions, prawns, bamboo shoots, chikuwa, mussels, ginger, in chicken noodle soup... sounded good, but everything just tasted like right-out-of-package quality... ugh... definitely nowhere near authentic Japanese at all... \"You're being Wagamama!!\" \"No, I'm not!!\" Okay I'm talking to myself. The noodles were the worst as it was so dry. Even instant noodles from Japan taste better. No flavor at all. The karaage was the worst ever! How can they even call it that?? Tiny hard mess. I think the calamari was the only reasonable one out of the stuff ordered. So if you want to try a \"McDonald's Japanese ramen\" in London, check out this place, complain about the food, and they can call you \"Wagamama\".",

However our food came very quickly and was delicious! Our server was very friendly and asked if everything was okay during our meal. The vegan options are generous but I do wish there was more variety. I'm sure if I had asked to veganise other dishes that would have been fine though. The meals were generous as Wagamama meals generally are. I would definitely go to this one again. The staff member at the front was very friendly and smiled at us and said goodbye as we were leaving.",

If you are traveling alone, the setup does not make you feel awkward at all about dining as a party of one.The food is reliable, consistent. The prices are fair, the service is quick and friendly, and the location is extremely convenient to both the insurance district and Tower of London.",
