It doesn't disappoint as you will be offered meat until you can (m)eat no more, and as if that wasn't enough there is also a pretty diverse buffet to choose from. I long to go back to this meat temple again sometime, nowhere else comes close for pure celebration of meats.",

By 6.10 we were seated, an excellent Malbec (30 squid a bottle) decanted in front of us, and a plate edged with meat lasagna (delicious and worth sacrificing some stomach space for). By 6.15 we were tucking into various cuts of meat brought to us by men carrying laden skewers and armed with machetes that they deftly manipulate to slice a portion of meat and deliver it to your plate. We started with BBQ sausage, then on to freshly roasted chicken wings, followed by top round, and finally a sirloin that had merely seen the reflection of a flame and serves steaming and dripping with juices. Other dishes included various types of sausages, grilled lamb, and roast ham. We ate continuously for over an hour and even though we were stuffed I still tried to cram another piece into my mouth (to the consternation of my date who wasn't pleased with the food coma I was rapidly slipping into).The salad bar and hot dishes also included in the 23 squid price tag were delicious although I refused to indulge too much as the meat was the prize. However, next time I may just go for the salad bar which is cheaper at around 15 squids.",

I had visited the Westbourne Grove restaurant a few times when I felt nostalgic for Brazil.My eight year old fancied some meat so off we went.This branch is far more comfortable and spacious than Westbourn Grove, but still, I have to say that this is no more than a taste of the genuine Brazilian experience. For one thing, the quality of the meat is just not a patch. I am sure they use Brazilian beef, but the really good Rodizios in Brazil serve Argentine beef which is superior. The meat today was tougher than I had hoped. I also found the chicken hearts undercooked. It may be my taste, but I like them very well done and crispy.Also, you just don't get the choice of cuts you would get in Brazil.However the chicken wings, sausages and salad bar were very good.If you don't have deserts and booze, \u00a0it is quite reasonably well price.Still, good fun with friends for a night out, although you won't want to do anything strenuous afterwards.",

    "text": "So, a friend of mine was celebrating his birthday yesterday. A week or so beforehand, hearing rave reviews about the fun vibrant atmosphere at Rodizio Rico, he had phoned up and booked a table for 15 for his birthday celebrations. A few days later, mid-week, he phoned up again to check that the booking was OK. \"It's all fine, we'll call you on Friday to confirm\" he was told. Friday came and went -- he wasn't called back, but didn't really think much of it. And so, on the big day itself, he gave the restaurant a call just to double-check that everything was OK. Sadly, Rodizio Rico had no record of his booking, claimed to never have heard from him, and were generally dismissive of him. \"We're fully booked, and you have no booking here\" was the most help he could get from them. So, I hear great things about the restaurant, its meat and its atmosphere. But I cannot personally review this aspect of Rodizio Rico, as they managed to fail spectacularly far before we even managed to get through the door. By all accounts, this is supposedly a pretty fun place. So don't let this single incident put you off. Unless of course you have any intention of booking in advance, in which case you might be better off trying somewhere else. If I ever feel inclined to try and go there again, and if I actually succeed in doing so, I dare say I'll update this review based on what it's actually like once you get in. (BTW, the story had a happy ending - we went to Gallipoli Again, who sorted us out with a great table at pretty short notice.)",

Service is fast, the side dishes are yummy and the meat is AMAZING! Honestly, it's so amazing and it just keeps coming. Best thing is to come on an empty stomach, skip the sides and just enjoy all the meat! Glad to say the service hasn't deteriorated in the last few years. Great place for a family meal out.",

    "text": "I went with a friend who had visited in the past, and said it was one of the best things he had ever eaten. So of course, I had very high expectations! We arrived not long after they opened at 6pm and it was still very empty in there which was great. We were seated straightaway, which was fantastic, and served very quickly. I like the idea of the open side bar. You can have as much salad, rice, vegetables, etc as you like to go with your meat which is great, and you can pick it yourself. Having said that I do like that the meat comes around to your table too. I have never experienced it before and wondered what it would be like, and in fact, it's a great atmosphere. The meat on the whole was very nice, but there were some meats that I have tasted much better elsewhere, especially the ribs. A lot of the meat seems to be low quality cuts and I think that is why it tends to be more fatty. However, the way it is cooked is beautiful. Overall I'm not sure that by the waiters coming around to you that you get your \u00a325 worth of meat, because as you wait for each piece to be brought to you, you eat more sides as a result of being hungry. So I'm not sure I would rush back for this reason. Would rather buy an expensive steak!",

    "text": "Rodizio Rico is kind of like a meat lover's dream. The best thing about the Brazilian BBQ places is that you know you will never leave hungry. As my partner said, \"If you are ordering dessert, clearly you've done something wrong.\"There's a wide spread buffet to start off with. The buffet has a nice selection of salads, cheesy bread (get this), fried bananas (also get this), beans and a selection of other vegetarian goodies (also get the eggplant and mushrooms with the garlic sauce).But don't get too much, because when you get back is when the meat comes around. And there's a lot of it. I won't even try to get into the massive selection of meat they brought out. Unfortunately, the people with the meat skewers do kind of like to force a lot on you at the beginning, then they refuse to give it to you because you have too much. Well if you hadn't sliced off EIGHT SLICES of beef the last time you came around, we'd probably be okay to get some of that pork. The top meats (for me) were the chicken hearts (eat as many as possible), the chicken legs, the beef ribs and the beef neck. A lot of the other cuts of meat were chewy and not that great (even though they did come out nicely rare to medium). The service is fairly good too. Our waiter was very friendly and offered to get us some fries to go with the food as well. He was also Australian so wanted to talk to us about where we were from (although I was the only American there that night, so it wasn't as exciting as he thought it was going to be). It was a bit tricky sometimes to get the water pitcher filled up, and some of the guys with the skewers were a bit aggressive about not giving us any meat because they had cut us off too much already.So it's a nice place, but not the best. The meat isn't the best quality (but what do you expect for unlimited meat for \u00a325). I wouldn't say no to coming back, but it's definitely not at the top of my list. You can definitely eat your weight in meat, but be warned that you may be way too stuffed to sleep later in the evening.",

The traffic light never sees red - not on our shift.The variety coming off the grill is respectable with no grilled veggies and similar pollutants pissing on the meat parade. The big surprise was the grilled chicken hearts - never would I have expected it to be a favorite of the night even among the less adventurous.Rodizio, I salute you! (cue formation fly over)",

    "text": "Meh. Meh? Yes...meh.I'll start by saying that I'm not a big fan of beef, so I am basing my review solely on the chicken and pork offerings, as well as the salad bar. The salad bar was random and didn't offer as many fresh items as other churrascarias I have been to. Some of the offerings were downright odd: lasagna? Stir fried Chinese veggies? I...um...yeah, no thanks. The chicken sausages were what appeared to be just chunks of chicken shoved in casing. It sounds great in theory, but it resulted in a very dry, chewy sausage that lacked in fat and something to bind it all together.The pork ribs were tasty, but mine was raw near the bone. Raw pork is no bueno, so I didn't take that when it came back a second time. The chicken thigh was nice; moist, with a good grilled flavor. Pork roast never made it to my table, sadly, so I can't comment on that.I will say that my husband enjoyed the beef that came around frequently. I would say it was 2:1 in favor of beef being offered. So that might have increased my review if I had sampled those offerings. The beef looked amazing and the quality seemed good. The mojitos were very nice, fresh and crisp. The service was spotty and our server spoke almost no English, making requests for additional napkins and a jug of water a bit more of an ordeal than it should be.All in all, I probably wouldn't go back unless I was hosting dinner for the Samoan rugby team or something.",

    "text": "I kind of liked the concept of the restaurant, which takes me back to some backpacking memories in South America.The veg buffet is quite impressive in its quality and diversity. The cocktails are impressive as well, very tasty and different, yest not too sweet, creamy nor sour !I'll stop here with the \"pros\" list.Now the down part: the service is quite average, at least in my experience last night. Nobody came to great me when I came in, yet I had merely put my scarf down that a waitress came to me and told me to pick a cocktail from the (quite nice) list. Wow, calm down !One of the waitresses looked angry (not at us), the whole night, and sometimes said incomprehensible things (like, you get 2 buffet vouchers, when we were three, then took off).Even though the rest of the service was fine, most of the waiters didn't understand when we asked them a question beyond \"yes\" or \"no\", when they were bringing those huge skewers of meat.The meat now.... It's supposed to be the highlight of the restaurant (and truly, of any true churrasqueria). However, most of the pieces they brought us was over-cooked, under-seasoned and sometimes dry.Notable exceptions: some beef pieces, the chicken wings, and the chicken hearts !Also, they came at a very steady pace towards us, asked us if we wanted more meat. After saying \"Yes\" the first 4 times, we quickly got swamped by meat. Then we start refusing politely, but they didn't look too happy about it (c'mon, smiling isn't that hard !).All in all, an average night. It would have been absolutely fine if the buffet price (basically the only option) wasn't that high.",

At \u00a322.50 this place isn't cheap but when you can eat a farm yard worth of meat it works out well.The waiters come around with skewers of meat and then slice off a piece at your table. Over the course of the night, I had steak, beef, ham, ribs, sausage and lamb. The service is great despite being in the corner, the waiters kept coming but I lacked the capacity for chicken wings, beef with cheese and chicken hearts.I'll definitely make a return visit to Rodizio Rico once my body recovers from all that meat.",

There were beef, pork ribs, chicken wings, hearts, and chicken sausage - which was my least favorite item. \u00a0It was heavily salted / seasoned, and extremely garlicky, and this is coming from a garlic lover! \u00a0In case anyone was wondering, the chicken meat was not ground up, but are chunks of chicken stuffed into a sausage casing. \u00a0When the waiters arrived with the spit-roasted meats, I oooh'd and ahhh'd as they sliced the meat onto my plate, but the novelty quickly wore off. \u00a0Someone else commented that the meat was either cooked too rare or too well done. \u00a0I have to agree on that, as the waiter brought the meat back to the kitchen when he realized the meat was too rare.The salad bar wasn't great, and certainly not worth the \u00a318 if thats what you're going for. There were stuffed mushrooms, pasta and potato salads, olives, roasted veggies, ox stew, fries, rice, and beans. \u00a0Actually the highlight was these little mini cheese bread balls.. now those \u00a0were delicious!Service - the guys with the massive meat skewers came by frequently, which everyone was quite happy with, though the waitress kept asking if we were done and eager to clear up the table.Overall, not bad. \u00a0A fun place to try out, but I wasn't really into the all you can eat meat.The reason for my 1 star? \u00a0I'm writing this review as I'm clenching onto my toilet bowl for dear life. \u00a0Remember the scene in Bridesmaids where Lillian was staggering across the street and ends up sh*tting herself? \u00a0I almost didn't make it to my doorstep. \u00a0What should have been an 8 minute walk home, ended up being an 18 minute walk home. \u00a0I have no idea what made me sick but I'm def not going back!",

I must say this is one of the better brazilian places, but few problems would make me not give them a high 5. So breakdown:Service - generally it was good but for some reason they kept bringing the same meat 3-4 times in a row. A bit annoying - the point of such place is to have new things, after all its like 15 different types of meat...Salad bar - fantastic, lots of selection, only thing i would have liked to see is black beans instead of refried beans. I loved the fact you could grab their famous cheese balls there and not wait for server to bring them.Meat - most was very nice and key thing, not over marinated. Few pieces were a bit hard.Also one thing is this place can get quite crowded with not much room. Perhaps thats the reason they dont bring meat out that often, servers barely have room to walk.",

I went on a Friday night and it was bustling with many large boisterous groups. \u00a0As with most churrascarias there is an endless parade of all things meat (sirloin, skirt steak, pork, chicken wings, salt beef, etc). There are also well disguised skewers of chicken hearts so be sure to ask what meat it is first! \u00a0You get a nifty red and green card (red means = NO, I'm stuffed, Yes = More Meat! Please!). They make some well crafted caiprihinas with cacha\u00e7a...having a few will make the experience even more memorable.But why just 3 stars for Rodizio Rico? Well compared to other churrascarias I've been too, this one is a bit of a let down. The meat albeit plentiful was continually either too rare or too well done, and sometimes a bit chewy. You definitley get quantity over quality here. That said, there is good value to be had (just over 20 pounds/person for unlimited salad bar and meat) and I do like the concept. Last bit of advice...be sure to be careful when you go to the toilets (especially after drinking multiple caiprihinas) as there are plenty of waiters running around with skewers of beef and comically large swords and they don't always look where they are going.",
