I was hoping he would recommend a few highlights from the menu but he didn't even though we asked. Food was delicious and it was great value. It's a pretty big restaurant and was full on a Sat night at 8:30pm. Will come back for a stable meal.",

Don't be put off, this was very tasty.Dessert for me was a \"chocolate pot\". The pot was a little bigger than an egg-cup but what it lacked in size it made up for in taste - rich and bitter-sweet beneath a creamy white layer (should have ordered two!)Expresso coffees were even smaller - a one gulp cafeine hit that helped jolt the sense back to reality after a couple of bottles of beer.",

Next time I will ask for the bill when I order the coffee.The desert, quite a delicate tarte fine aux pommes, was served with a large spoon and fork as you would get at school diners for a big bowl of spotted dick and custard. \u00a0Tarte fine suggests a smaller spoon size not some lumpen thing so a teaspoon was used. \u00a0Time to improve their cutlery",

The restaurant is simple, yet chic. It spans over three main dining rooms and would be a great place for a private party or romantic evening out. The service was impeccable, as our server offered useful suggestions and our food was prepared in a timely manner! Ask for Paolo or Claudio.",

Only negative I can think of is that it seemed that the wait staff are a bit miffed if they don't think you are ordering enough food in their opinion (we ordered wine and beer then just ordered 1 appetizer to share because we knew we would be having dessert on top of each of our entrees which I think is more than enough) but as soon as they heard our meal choices and that we wanted dessert they did a complete 180 and treated us the rest of the time very friendly. \u00a0I get it, you want your tip (they add 12% in, which has been happening frequently lately at every resto and kind of annoying) but there's an art in not letting the customers know/feel it.",

They have different priced menus for lunch, pre theatre and A la Carte, but no matter what menu you choose from the food quality is great. The dishes are not complicated just simple French Bistro styled food prepared and cooked really well. The service is super quick and the waiters very efficient, maybe they could smile a bit more but they're RUNNING, this place is busy! Let's keep it that way; it's so much better than its competition. There are five Cote Restaurants now, I hope they can keep popping up in a few more places. I've been to their Covent Garden one a few times now and they just keep ticking those boxes, yum,yum,yum!",

It was much needed after post- Oxford Street christmas shopping!We arrived just before 7pm, and so we were in time for the pre-theatre menu. This was 2/3 courses for about \u00a312/\u00a314. We were seated immediately by a very friendly host. After perusing the menu for a few minutes, we ordered a bottle of red wine and from the set menu opted for a pizza-style starter each (it has a snazzy French name but I can't remember it!). For mains I opted for the steak and my mum had the seabass. Then for desert we both had the apple and almond tart with vanilla ice cream. And every last mouthful was delicious! I actually commented that from the set menu I could visit 3 times and have 3 completely different meals as everything sounded great. We finished with a couple of coffees, and the total bill was around \u00a345. A great price for the quality of food. The service was excellent, and the place filled up a lot while we were there. I would definitely re-visit and recommend.",

As the Royal opera is there, you will find lots of actors practicing by singing their soul out in public.If you are fortunate enough to get hold of \u00a0musical tickets, you will find lots of smart restaurants around Covent Garden offering pre theatre dinners. If you are unfortunate enough, most of those might be \u00a0fully booked already and it is a gamble to stumble into the right restaurant without a reservation.Cote Bistro was our lucky strike that night, not having any time to loose as the musical started in an hour. Their unique selling point is to cater for customers who want to enjoy a fantastic diner, which is quick, enjoyable and served by charming French waiters. Cote Bistro is a proud French restaurant. Therefore they offer French wine and French food only.The choices of the menu are simple but having had a look around me, I saw everyone going for the pre theatre menu option. A responsive waiter who made sure we enjoy ourselves understood our requests for mustard and pepper. That night we ordered the steak tartar as a starter for both of us, while as mains we ordered the moules \u00a0(excellent sauce) with fries and a chicken leg dish with a potato gratin and lots of vegetables - this was the safe options and delicious as well.",

We shared the Creme Caramel (their specialty) and the Tarte Fine aux Pommes.

With their pre fixe lunches and dinners, you are saving money, but they are not that consistent with their dishes. The best thing I have had here is a salad and a mushroom soup. Their English Breakfast is also very tasty, but iconic French dishes like coq au vin was bad, their mussels were ehh, and the food was somewhat warm. Besides their average food, I really appreciated their service. I have never come here when they have been really busy, but they were super accommodating. My friend ordered a steak the last time we went here and her medium steak was more like WELL DONE to the max and had burnt marks. Even though she ate almost all of it, when she told them how cooked it was, they gave her a new steak and side dishes and didn't charge us.

My hubbie had the tomato, shallot and basil salad which was quite good. The baguette that came with our appetizers was perfect in crumb and flavor, nice and chewy.For mains, I had the fish Pamentier in a dill cream sauce topped with a crisped crust of mashed potatoes, good with lots of fish. My hubbie had the wonderfully succulent sirloin steak with Roquefort butter, a bit of watercress and pommes frites.For dessert, my husband loved the Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e au Citron.

    "text": "We came in for dinner as the atmosphere looked nice and friendly. We had the fougasse for starters which was really good but the reason for the low rating is because of the food illness my wife got after dining here and the company's initial response. My wife had the grilled chicken and walnut salad which gave her an acute bout of food poisoning that sent us to the emergency room in the middle of the night. I called the restaurant the next day where they promised to give me a call back the same day and they never did. It wasn't until I called back again that a manager was kind enough to take my information and promised I will get a call back. Salads are one of those things that should be treated with extreme care and the fact that they couldn't get that right means this is a place I can never go back to.",

Walking around, looking for a place that won't scrounge money from us we find C\u00f4te. It seems ok, price looks average for central London and they are offering pre and post theatre menu!We walk inside and the girl at the door greets us and leads us to a tiny, dimly lit table near to the service stairs. My friend asks if we can change places? The girl rolls her eyes and sets us in a table at the very end, close to the toilets and where the smell is quite funny... But it is fine. We won't complain again. We don\u00b4t want her to kill us or worse, spit in our food!Our waitress arrives. Lovely girl this one, very polite and helpful. She takes our order and delivers drinks and starters in appropriate time. She does the same with our mains.I order the roast chicken with garlic sauce. It is ok, a bit undercooked for my taste, but it is probably my problem as I like my meat well cooked. My friend has the steak with frites and she seems to enjoy it. Portions are generous, so no complain about that.We pay. A bit overpriced for the food they serve. But, hey! It is a French restaurant! What am I expecting?We leave. The other girl is still at the door. Still not being nice to people.",

The linguine with seafood was a let down. \u00a0The prawns and squid were very tasty but the lack of sauce made this dish dry and well just boring. Positive points - Light bright large restaurant with contemporary decoration. \u00a0Wooden tables and chairs. We were in a group and a friend had the set lunch men at \u00a311.70 for 2 courses. \u00a0Her food was tastier and well just plain better than what we had on the a la carte menu. \u00a0I wish I had gone for it. The Kir Royal was only \u00a33.95 and was quaffable as was the Saumur Blanc, white wine. The corbieres was very drinkable and therefore this place definitely has a good wine list. My advice would be go for the set menu, I will next time on my return to see if this place can do any better? xoxo",

    "text": "Don't bother. Great staff, food is no good. Maybe it was because we showed up at 10:15pm (after watching the Lion King @ Lyceum Theatre...) we were just on the search for some tasty, delicious food. We chose Cote because it was the first place we came across that was open. The staff here is quite friendly, and you can tell that most of their customers join them post-theatre.Started off with Flatbread with caramelized onions and anchovies and the calamari. The Flatbread was good, nothing special. The calamari was a bit over-cooked (or maybe that's just the way they serve it). Next, as our mains, I wanted to go for something on the lighter side and ordered the goat cheese salad (with roast vegetables) and my friend got the beef bourguignon (cubes of beef/mushroom saut\u00e9ed with some sort of really really salty sauce with a side of dry mashed potatoes)... Both of us.... Utterly not impressed. (I've posted pictures)The goat cheese was great, but the vegetables were terrible... The carrots were way over cooked and the chunks of onions still had the ends on them (then again, maybe this is how they always serve it?) my salad was overly dressed with really limp/non-crunchy lettuce. My friend had got the beef bourguignon. The presentation of this plate (well, let's just say it looked much much better than it tasted). It was so salty!!! My friend literally had two bites and that was it. She sat there unsatisfied. She tried the mashed potatoes hoping to tame some of her hunger... And again, disappointment. I tried both, the bourguignon and the mashed potatoes - and I definitely don't blame her for not eating any of it! We decided to opt out of dessert because of our wonderful main experience Lol. The waitress brought around our bill and asked if something was wrong with the bourguignon (I guess she noticed it was untouched)... My friend said it was quite salty and she was no longer hungry. She went to the manager and he came over almost immediately insisting she try something else or we have dessert on the house. We decided against it, paid and left. We were satisfied when the manager did come over acknowledging we were not content. Great staff, but I would not recommend the food.",

    "text": "Walked in for a Friday lunch with no reservations and was able to get a table instantly. \u00a0Wasn't sure what I was expecting to spend price wise as it looked like a cute overpriced French bistro from the outside, but was complete opposite. Located a minutes walk away from Covent Garden, this location is ideal after a long day of shopping.There were two lunch menu offerings when I was there. Your two lunch menus were either 1) A choice of 5 mains with a drink (either soft drink, beer, a glass of red or white wine for under \u00a310 or 2) A 2 or 3 course menu, both for under \u00a315. You had a choice of 5 starters, 5 mains and 5 desserts which is absolutely brilliant for the price. I can't recall what I ordered for a starter but it was flatbread like with caramelized onions and melted cheese. I could have done without the started, but it was decent. There were many better options for starters such as the mint and pea soup with pine nuts, a pork appetizer, you weren't short of options. I went vegetarian and ordered a chick pea and squash cake which was delicious. It was meaty and hearty like a burger, but was still light and had this sweet but satisfying flavor about it. It was flavored with fresh herbs and wasn't heavily spiced, but had the most perfect taste. As I have a sweet tooth, I will always say that dessert is my favorite part of the meal. I just couldn't choose between the warm apple pie with shaved almonds, the chocolate cake or the Creme Caramel. I love the consistency of custard and sweet, so I went with the Creme Carmel and it comes highly recommended. Flan like consistency but silky smooth and sweet.Service was prompt, friendly and attentive. There was a mix of patrons enjoying a business lunch and just as many enjoying lunch on a day off. There were many more items that I'd love to try on the menu so I'd love to say I'd be back to work my way through the menu. I didn't even glance at the regular menu so I can't even imagine what options the dinner menu has to offer.",

All three dishes were perfect.The beef bourguignon was flavorful and tender without being burnt or overcooked (a common problem with this dish).The seafood in both the linguini and casserole were also cooked just right, without being over done.Everything was fresh and nicely, but not overly, seasoned and the cream sauces in the linguini and casserole were creamy without being lumpy or overly cheesy.We have already recommended Cote to friends who are traveling to London in a couple weeks.The next time we are in town, I'm certain we will make our way back to Cote.",
