Freshly prepared and very interesting we shared two mains, sushi and some sides which end up surprisingly filling considering it's all just veges. The sushi was super fresh, and the rice perfectly sticky. All of the other meals were easily shared and really interesting -- keep the menu with you as you won't believe what is in it all... clear sweet potato noodles anyone?! Shared an organic wine (yes, it isn't all holier-than-thou) which was really reasonable (13.50 bottle) and very crisp and zingy. Service is patchy, yet authentic. They obviously care about the quality of your meal and experience so helps excuse any misunderstandings all the way. 5 stars for vegans, 4 for carnivores!",

We had a number of sides including the seaweed, marinated tofu steak, fresh cabbage rolls and the miso. They were all delectable and none overpowering the other, which I believe is the art of japanese cuisine. Their tempura was fresh, hot and crispy..the rice that we ordered had a number of grains mixed in and I couldn't get enough of it. The service was reasonably good and the decor and the place are simple though well done. The price is a bit steep we ended up paying about 20-25 quid per person. We did not drink much, so I thought that was on the expensive side.All said and done, a small charming place if your looking for vegan/vegetarian Japanese grub!",

And very often, it's part of a party \u00a0so it's not being laid on to my taste. And my heart sinks whenever I hear I'm going for sushi. Simply put, the only place I've ever been where sushi for veggies worked was Nobu in the Milan Armani store (told you about the swanky joints!). That was spectacular. But now, in the far less salubrious hollow between Kings Cross and Exmouth Market, is this \u00a0vegan sushi.So, in short order a raw review (ahem):1. Staff and interior stunning \u00a0intimate, hushed, very Japanese, enjoyable.2. Menu \u00a0utterly confusing, loads of stuff, not brilliantly clear for most of us non-sushi/Japanese regulars (and, of course, why would most vegans or veggies be au fait with Japanese sushi menus).3. Ethos \u00a0excellent \u00a0healthy, homegrown-where possible.4. All importantly \u00a0flavour. Delicate. Do not go expecting mega tongue-bursting, mouth-smacking flavours. Delicate, refined dishes gently tease out complex notes of flavour. I guess that's a Japanese thing. But once I got used to it, it was a very enjoyable thing.So, in all, broadly excellent and well worth a veggie/vegan visit!",

    "text": "Itadaki Zen is a vegetarian Japanese restaurant between King's Cross and Angel. It is apparently the first of its kind in Europe. Outside of sushi and the recent rise of mostly pork-based ramen restaurants, the rich tradition of Japanese cuisine is hardly captured in this country. So it is nice to see this restaurant covering something different. The choice of chic Asian d\u00e9cor is very pleasant to eye. At 10 pounds, their bento lunch provides decent value for money. Miso soup is served in a small wooden bowl. Miso is light in taste but slices of green onions add extra kick. The main bento is served in a beautiful lacquer tray. Their rice is not the usual white rice. It's some sort of mixed grain rice and the stickier than usual texture makes it easier to manoeuvre it with my chopsticks. My favourite thing was the spring roll. Its filling was some sort of tofu and veggie mix. Crunch outside, and soft inside. Nice. Mini tofu steaks are browned on the outside to get that extra firm texture. The sauce is just soy sauce with sliced green onions and sesame sprinkled on top. It's very minimal \u00a0but tastes ok. Veggie tempuras are a little hard to eat, but once you get past the fact that you can't eat this thing without making a mess, it's worth the effort. The thin strips of veggies are coated with crunchy batter mix. The dip sauce for the tempuras is pretty basic soy sauce. It doesn't have the rich fish broth. I was ready to love this place for their commitment to the rarely-covered side of Japanese cuisine. But their execution can be a lot better with some minor improvements. It's a three with love from me.",

It was plain and simple, but also nostalgic and satisfactory. Some may say the food is just mediocre and not special. Some may complain that the atmosphere inside is not as elegant as other big-named Asian restaurants. But I think that is the value of this restaurant. It may not look as luxurious as other Asian restaurants. But it will give you the feeling that you are actually in a small restaurant in Japan. The taste was good and somewhat similar to noodles I had in Japan. Moreover, it was not that expensive. Then, this restaurant surely deserves a high mark.If you got tired of going to the same typical Asian restaurants, this place is where you should consider. As an East Asian, I felt like being home.",

Their menu hasn't changed that much since the last time we'd been here, which was maybe a year and half ago. We decided to splurge and get the tempura sushi set. Though everything is vegan, I love the wide array of tastes that is cooked up through marinades and different cooking techniques that they use. The black sesame pudding is to die for. It is so creamy and satisfying after a nice meal. I come back just for it!Admittedly, some of their items are more Korean than Japanese, but we don't mind. I love japchae, and they even have makkoli!",

    "text": "It is hard to find a good Vegan restaurant in London and is still the case after our visit to Itadaki Zen.It is a Japanese organic, Vegan restaurant and their web site states that their special rice, \"Kanseihan will be a valuable friend that will protect your health against the raging wars of the world\" and that their seasoning \"Kanseihan is the secret, all-powerful source of flavours ... carefully combine the essence of seaweeds, which represent the delicacies of the sea, with the essences of plants, which stand for the delicacies of the earth....\" \u00a0This all sounds philosophical & spiritual, and is meant to promote good health, so I was totally surprised by the saltiness of their Tendon (\u00a313). \u00a0Both Kakiage (deep-fried julienne of vegetables) and Kenseihan (see above) were very salty. \u00a0Too much salt not only is bad for your health, but also kills the natural sweetness/flavours of the ingredients. \u00a0Quite often Tempura/Kakiage is served with a Tempura dip, but I guess it is difficult to produce good one without Katsuo (dried bonito) stock.Miso Soup was very bland, lacked flavour and tasted odd; where was Miso?? \u00a0I think it was flavoured with little Miso and some soya sauce and konbu. \u00a0Vegan Miso Soup lacks the depth of Katsuo stock, so it is not fair to expect deep umami, but in order to compensate that, they do need to use good flavoursome Miso and vegetable stock.According to the menu, our set menu was supposed to come with Marinated Peanuts, but we were given Simmered Soya Beans with Hijiki instead. \u00a0Unfortunately our waitress failed to mention this.One of the side dishes was Green Beans with gooey dressing (mashed tofu & a bit of sesame?) which was pleasant, but again it needed something to enhance the flavour such as toasted sesame seeds. \u00a0Another one was Boiled Soya Bean Sprouts in Chilli & Garlic sauce; garlic killed the delicate sweetness of the sprouts. \u00a0It would have been much better dressed with soya sauce, sesame seeds, sugar, a bit of chilli and sesame seed oil.Kimpab set (\u00a313) came with 8 pieces of tiny rolled rice (not vinegary like sushi rice) with fresh vegetables in the middle. \u00a0Harumaki (Spring Rolls) were crunchy outside and mushy inside. \u00a0They were OK but not worth \u00a313.There was only one waitress and she was very polite but completely lacked knowledge of the food they served. \u00a0She kept going back to the kitchen to get the answers to our questions, but still failed to give us sufficient answers. \u00a0I ended up going to the kitchen and talked to the chef directly.On our visit on Wednesday evening, we were the only diners until one female diner came. \u00a0Judging from the prices and what they were offering on the menu, it wasn't a surprise. \u00a0Their cooking is OK and the ingredients were fresh, but the food lacked depth and was nothing special; most of the items on the menu weren't worth the price. \u00a0Miso Soup in particular was unpleasant. \u00a0Instead of changing the flavour for the Western palate like adding salt to rice, they should stick with the traditional Shojin Ryori (Japanese Vegan food) style and expand the menu away from the current one based heavily on rice/noodle.Miles Davis's \"Kind of Blue\" album (my favourite Jazz album) was playing on the background and we were the only diners most of the time, so the atmosphere was relaxed; if the place was busy, I doubt it if the waitress can cope. \u00a0If you are expecting a cleansing effect and philosophical enlightenment from eating there, you will be disappointed. \u00a0However, if you are curious, try their lunch menu at \u00a36.",

I think altogether we were there for almost 2 hours, and by the time we left there were still people sitting down that had been there when we arrived. I had to ask for the check twice. The second time I asked I didn't even realize that they had been closed for about 20 minutes. I flagged the waitress down, asked her for the check and then watched her stand behind the counter and gaze off into the distance for a while before making another round of the tables getting people drinks. I wasn't in a rush per se but we were in London for only a couple days, and wanted to go do things that night. I really didn't have 2 hours to blow on dinner. Cornering the market on chill is nice, but it's honestly kind of rude to ignore someone who clearly wants to gtfo after they've eaten.A word to the wise: reserve a table ahead of time. The restaurant is small and fills up quick. There's no mention of that on the website. And if they're content to let everyone camp out all night I wouldn't take your chances waiting for an open table.",

There was so much flavor and everything tasted fresh.  I went without a reservation, which probably wasn't a good idea. The place gets packed! The service was slow but I think they were doing the best they could. I would definitely go here again next time I'm in London.",

It's all these beautiful vegetables, served up in combos, some hot or cold, inspired by sushi as we know it here, but vegetarian. They taste incredible, hearty, some served warm, some cold, just delicious, meticulously arranged and served.Try the goji berry tea for a lightly sweetened tea of beautifully blended tastes, especially with the pumpkin cakes for dessert.",

Additionally, the price is not consistent with the quality or quantity of the dishes. You are paying above sushi prices, without the sushi. It's like you're on Candid Camera but there's no hidden cameras to expose that you're participating in a T.V. show prank, this is reality and it sucks. I gave it two stars because I do feel the obligation to give them a little cred for being vegan and the ambiance is chill. But in this era where your pockets are tight and you want some quality with your experience, I cannot say this place shines on my radar.",

I am a devout carnivore so I was suitably sceptical when I crossed the threshold, but I left intending to come back. The staff are very polite and the food is freshly prepared to order. The harumaki spring rolls are light and, unlike many other types served across this green and pleasant land, you can tell what ingredients are in them, which is always a good thing. The tempura was light and crispy and served with some soft and tasty rice. The sasou tea was good and tasted vaguely nostalgic for some reason I can't quite put my finger on.Overall a great new experience. I'll be back",

The kakiage tempura was my fave part while he enjoyed some veggie sushi. I think we were both impressed with the taste and variety of the food, hardly needing to add soy sauce to anything, even the tofu!It's not the most 'polished' place - the menu pages were out of order and they didn't have the first 2 drinks I asked for. But we liked the homely and mindful ethos of the place, the staff were sweet and the prices weren't bad for the quality of what you got. We left with smiles and full tummies :)",

Absolutely not. The food here is so fresh and full of flavour that meat would completely spoil the experience, as they bring out dish after dish of pickled vegetables or tempura. When you're not too busy trying to identify the piece of food you're eating, you'll be at awe in how they pack all that taste into such small dishes, and in a way that won't leave you feeling completely guilty about your diet! We opted for the set menu which was a whirlwind tour of their offerings, and left us feeling full and extremely satisfied! Even vegan dessert, a cheesecake no less, was creamy and full of goodness! All in all, a lovely little restaurant that serves some super healthy and honest cooking. The amount of care and precision in the food served is impeccable, and I would gladly come back again. My only qualm with the place is that they pack in the customers, so it can get quite cosy inside and can make romantic dates somewhat less romantic when someone has to climb over you to get out!",

The only reason I didn't give this review 5 stars is because the service, while friendly, was suuuuuuuuuuuuuuper slow.It's a small restaurant and vegan, but that doesn't stop this place from being really busy even on a Monday night. I'd suggest grabbing a reservation if you're interested.Now, onto the food. I can't remember everything we had but the highlights were the wine, miso soup, seaweed, spring rolls, and noodles. Both the fried noodles with veggies and the cold soba noodles with a spicy topping were excellent. The presentation is lovely and does take a while to come out, but it's certainly prepared quite meticulously.

However my fianc\u00e9e and I (neither of us are vegan or vegetarian) both felt in need of more vegetables after the rich-food of our Christmas holidays, so we gave it a try... They have lots of set menus, along with small al a carte dishes and larger donburi and noodle based things. The style is like traditional home cooking, rather than kaiseki-style vegan. As everyone has mentioned, the sushi is pretty cool. They didn't serve any of the vegan sushi that I expected (like inari-zushi or tomorokoshi) but their alternatives are innovative and tasty:* tempura-ed nori * fried tofu* spinach* seaweed - like the seasoned seaweed you get inside onigiri* carrot surrounded by nori* miso/seaweed - this was the highlight...it was really good.Pro-tip: They each have their own flavour, so you don't need to add soy sauce...However, I liked the tempura donburi even MORE than the sushi. It was Kakiage (so lots of shredded vegetables fried in a big lump.) This used to be my favourite canteen dish at my university dormitory in Japan...but this was an even tastier version! It was perfectly seasoned and served on REALLY good, grain-packed, slightly purple coloured rice. Delicious.Lastly, the sesame pudding and kabocha cakes were both loooovely. Less Good bits:* I have ordered take-away bento lunches with some colleagues at work, and found the portions were a bit small. I think this place is best for dinner rather than for bentos. * The music was terrible - it was like elevator jazz music.Tastecard saving: \u00a30 (They wouldn't let me use it as we didn't call in advance)",

And man I was proved wrong. The food was beyond my wildest expectations. It did not seem like a compromise in any way. It was actually good Japanese food. That it was also vegan, was an added bonus. We started with the sushi set. And were very happy with it. My partner got the bimbimbap set and I settled for something unpronounceable :-). We specifically avoided the tempura set because I wanted something more than just batter fried veggies. Everything was excellent. Of special mention were the sweet peanuts & sesame coated green beans in my set. And the hot sauce that came with the bibimbap.And for desert, we had the tofu cheesecake and sesame pudding, which rocked my world! It was so good, I could've easily downed a few more. And since everything was plant based, although you were full, you did not feel like you were in a food-induced coma. Excellent meal. Will surely go here again.",

The menu is confusing with lots of incredible-sounding and complicated items so in the end, to accommodate the coeliac, we went with the gluten-free noodles which were made from sweet potato and so uber-delicious that we ended up getting another portion! \u00a0I also loved the rice/lentil/grain dish which was a *lot* like an Indian item I know well and the miso soup was perfectly seasoned alongside.The spring rolls were ok but I adored the seaweed (pungent, tiny portion with an incredible umami kick) and the kimchi as sides. The decor is cool and relaxed, zen-vibing as you'd expect and we got the fab private room downstairs. Staff were super-friendly and I'd recommend this place wholeheartedly for a happy, healthy meal :D",

It isn't much expensive either, you can get a complete bento box for \u00a310 or so. To top it, they have some great variety of teas and wines. The service is prompt and fast. The food is delicious and has a feel of Buddhist cuisine to it (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bu\u2026). \u00a0The ambience has a nice simplistic feel to it. Also, being right around Kings Cross, the location is great as well.",

    "text": "My boyfriend too me here for a special anniversary meal. This is an exclusively vegan restaurant which is very exciting! We ordered from the selection of set meals! They brought us little tasty starter plates, followed by some sushi and then our main dishes. I had the tempura menu. The ingredients were very fresh and tasty! One of my favourite things was the sushi. It was simple but lovely! Throughout the meal there weren't any fancy ingredients used and not a great deal of seasoning, it was more a celebration of natural and fresh ingredients! We had a vegan cheesecake for dessert! It tasted great despite the texture being a little odd, but I was very impressed! No idea how they made it without cheese!? :p",

    "text": "Mar 2015: now I have had the pleasure of trying the desserts: (the small Zen cakes were reassuring soft with a nice rise to suggest they are freshly baked and including sultanas to add an intriguing element to an already pleasant cake), the sesame pudding was delightfully smooth, melt-in-your mouth goodness and the raspberry-topped tofu cheesecake is dangerously delicious such that I'm sure I could eat 3 or 4 slices if I didn't have a conscience!)P.S. The seaweed and kimchi was a bit too sharp in flavour for my liking but worth a try if you are ordinarily a fan of kimchi (which I am not anyway)Jan 2015 review (4/5): Simple yet beautifully executed, Itadaki Zen is a vegan Japanese nest of a restaurant within walking distance of King's Cross station. It gives birth to the concept that vegan and gluten-free food can still be crafted exquisitely with differences in texture, colour and taste. Testament to how authentically Japanese Itadaki Zen is, the staff are so Japanese that they can barely communicate in English and the menu has a few grammatical errors as if it has been translated roughly into English from the words of a Japanese chef. Yet everything from the choice of words on the menu and intricate recipes to the simple uniform of the staff and humble decor of the restaurant gives an aura of sincerity and a personal touch.\u00a0The menu consists of well designed combinations of dinner sets that mostly consist of various small portions of food that complement each other well. I had the Chapche set which included a dish of fried noodles made of sweet potato starch cooked with vegetables, Kikurage and Shitake mushrooms alongside 3 vegan tofu sushi rolls, 2 fried spring rolls and miso soup. A classic tell-tale sign of good vegetarian food is when a meat-eater such as myself can simply forget that meat even exists let alone that the food currently on the table does not contain any meat or by-product of meat. Such was the flavour, appeal and ingenuity of the food that I genuinely did not have cause to give any thought for it's lacking in meat. The fact that the food was healthier-than-average was just an added bonus. The variety of non-alcoholic beverages is just right; a satisfying range of soft drinks as well as delightful options for tea including the Siawase tea (containing Jujube and goji berries), which although at \u00a33 costs more than the other drinks does genuinely feel refreshing and favourable to digestion.Having said all the above, Itadaki Zen is still a little rough around the edges in that it could do with some refining of it's interior and I found the tofu sushi rolls to be a little lacking in flavour e.g. they could have done with a little pickle, wasabi or other fragrance or spice. What I mean by interior is that whilst the cracked walls, the hanging charms and overall atmosphere of the restaurant is indeed pleasant, the front needs a little work. It appears as though initially there could have been a waiting area by the front door but since the restaurant is so small they've squeezed another table that protrudes to just by the door such that the arrangement looks odd and we (who happened to be sitting at this table) were greeted by a gust of wind each time new customers came or old customers left. Frankly, I think if they changed the style of seating to sitting on the floor true to Japanese tradition, the restaurant would be even more extraordinary and be able to fit more people.To conclude, Itadaki Zen is a quaint, authentic gem of a Japanese haunt; understated and easy-to-stomach. A word of warning however for people with a big appetite for meat and a filling meal, this may not be your cup of tea so don't kid yourself otherwise ;)",

    "text": "May I remind some reviewers that \"sushi\" in fact, refers to the seasoned rice, so yes sushi IS vegan (until you add fish, egg, or meat). Sorry, one of my pet peeves.I lived in Japan as a vegan for 3 years, so I'm not as wowed by it as others seem to be. But it is tasty. There are some good flavors yes, and that sushi platter is nice, yes. I'm not sure why they have a couple Korean dishes on there (although their Jap Chae IS really good).I would recommend it if you are curious. You won't know until you try. There aren't any vegan Japanese places around, and they claim to specialize in shojin ryori, temple food. Yes, they might be a bit pricey, but 1- London, and 2- Have you ever made Japanese food like this? It is extremely fiddly and I believe all organic. The price suits it fine.PRO TIP: Make sure you get your spring roll fried, not steamed. I wasn't feeling fried-foody and the steamed roll is incredibly disgusting and chewy in a bad way.",

    "text": "My friend chose this place for dinner. I love vegan restaurants but have never been to a Japanese vegan one before. It has an authentic Japanese feel with decoration and Japanese speaking staff. My friend who also speaks Japanese knew the good stuff to order, and helped me pick out something (to clarify the menu was all in English I just didn't know what some of the dishes were). I ordered the 12 set of vegan sushi, which was tasty, but I still prefer raw fish for my sushi. The sushi had roasted peppers, mushrooms, avocado, pickled bean sprouts, carrots, tofu, spinach and okra as its toppings. Once again all delicious. My friend got a different dish, the name of which escapes me, but she loved it and I tried a bite of there tempura veggies and they were yummy. Wish the menu had more choices from smaller dishes since I wasn't super hungry, and could have done with half my sushi. A bit pricey but I guess thats the area and because it was a specialty restaurant.",
