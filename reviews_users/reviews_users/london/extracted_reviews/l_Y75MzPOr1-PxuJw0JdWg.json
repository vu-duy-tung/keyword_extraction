These include: morning glory cod, fish cakes, prawn phad Thai and green curry, prawn red panang curry. Only bummer is that they don't take american express.",

The restaurant was packed when we arrived, and we had to wait a bit, even though we had placed reservations. I cannot fully recall what we ordered, since we were a large group, but I remember the dishes were truly tasty and memorable. Our Thai friend had recommended the place, and she ordered most of the dishes. You'll find that many Thai and Chinese people frequent this place.. so if you wish to sink your teeth into genuine Thai food without leaving the country, Addies is the place to go. Prices and portions are very reasonable. We paid under \u00a320 per head the last time we were there, and this included drinks, starters, main courses and we were completely full by the time we rolled out of the restaurant.",

The restaurant was busy but did not feel crowded, the staff were efficient and I easily attracted their attention when needed. Not being a Thai regular, I appreciated the descriptions in the menu and was able to order what I wanted. The food was superb - what I imagine good Thai home cooking might taste like. I had prawns in spring rolls with a hot sauce as a starter, and a duck curry with plain rice as my main course. Both were as described on the menu. The curry in particular exceeded my expectations with a rich creamy sauce bursting onto my tongue with so many flavours - it was just a great experience. Sometimes all it takes to be great is not to get anything wrong. Addies ticked all the boxes on service, atmosphere, price and especially quality of food, so all round this restaurant is a great find that i will be taking friends back to.",

Oh, and they aren't afraid of spicing it up -- a lot. We had a pork starter that left our mouths burning, but in a good way. The duck main course recommended by our server was unexpected and delicious.

    "text": "Addie's Thai is an Urban Legend; and for good reason too. They've been here since 1987, and are still going strong; not surprising, as they've perfected the art of serving Oriental fast food that places the sole priority of satisfying the eater's tastebuds first, way before everything else. It's all about the flavour; there are no corners cut here when it comes to tending to the tongue. The flavours are over-the-top, massively indulgent, satiating, animated in appearance, glutinous, and gluttonous; a real treat, leaving the mouth awash with pure satisfaction, with lips curled up at the side in sheer delight. When it boils down to it, 'Oriental delivery/takeaways' are a treat really, aren't they? You don't eat this type of food to get healthy, do you? You eat it because it tastes good; it tastes different; it's the opposite of boring isn't it? 'Boring' is boiling a pot of pasta and adding some ground beef to it to turn it into a Spaghetti Bolognese; 'fun' is picking up the phone after a few drinks and having a bit of a bubbly chinwag with the restauranteur, then setting the stop-watch before frantically scurrying around the house like the Tasmanian devil, trying to find some cash (with a fictitious elongated 30-min Countdown theme-tune building up in your head), or for the more sadistic of you, gleefully laying in wait until the order has been relayed, then reveling in the tremendous joy of hearing that ever-so-slight woefully sounding sigh as you connivingly state to the person on the other end of the line I'd like to pay by card please.; the cheap thrill you get and the goosebumps that cover your forearms when the front doorbell goes, it's here!!!; the ceremonial '2001 A Space Odyssey'-styled 'opening of the front door' to greet the spaceman who smells of traffic (who's already reaching out to hand you a big plastic bag filled with your steaming goodyness); the expectation of it all; the pulling of the dishes out one by one from of the bag and trying to figure out what is what and who's is who's; the lid-popping; the sniffing; the obligatory I didn't order this!? comment regardless of the whether or not it was what you ordered; the tucking-in, the munching-with-no-manners, the burping, the small-talk, the guzzling of the fizzy drink right at the end; the playing of 'kitchen-basketbal' with the kitchen bin and the empty containers; and then finally, the last act, the waddling over to the sofa and slumping down in it like a Walrus auditioning for a part in the 'Royle Family'. There's a whole culture involved isn't there? It's an operatic act starting right from the second you pick up the phone. And with Addie's Thai, you are not just 'ordering a takeaway', you are buying a ticket or two for this Oriental opera, that will provide you with the classic takeaway/delivery experience, from start to finish.  As soon as the call is answered, you are greeted by the ever-chirpy, effusively attentive, heart-warmingly friendly host, a lady who's name I have forgotten, who, regardless of the weather, will cheer you up no-end, and by the second call, will know your first name and your favourite dishes off by heart. Slightly lascivious in nature, if you are male, do not be put off by what may seem like flirtatious behaviour; it all adds to the Addie's experience. This is the time to practice some sexual innuendo jokes, or any joke for that matter. The phone-calling here reminds me of communicating with male Air Stewards on British Airways flights; it's got that similar sort of tongue-in-cheek Carry-on style of tone to it. And when the food arrives, you will have no trouble whatsoever with their extremely efficient, polite, methodical delivery staff; have no fear, there won't be any Hey, how's it going geezer?! Did ya watch tha footy?! small-talk here, nor any off-putting 'huffs and puffs' from peeved-off drivers, as the Addie's delivery crew are like commandos, straight in, straight out, hi and bye is all you get (if that), and that's it. For the more frugal of you out there, rest assured, you will not encounter any 'Oxfam eyes' from the driver, as the passing-over of the food is complete, but I always tip anyway, so personal preference is key here. The food is gorgeous. I quickly became an Addie's addict circa 2006/2007, when I was living in an apartment block in South Kensington, and had the good fortune of coming across one of their menus they had left on the counter of the reception down in the lobby. The rest is history. I was ordering at least three times a week from them, and quickly became a regular Alas, I am no longer an addict now, as I went into re-hab (moved 'north of the park'), and as they don't deliver too far from their base-camp, their food is something I will not have the pleasure of experiencing any time soon.  FOOD: Phad Thai: 'Alice in Wonderland'-styled appearance of this staple Thai dish, with whopping chunks of all the ingredients crammed into the container, with the lid literally bursting",

    "text": "I learnt about Addie's from people who generally don't ever go to Earl's Court. Yes, it's got a reputation that has spread far and wide. I've only been here twice so far as I don't live in the area (the most recent visit being this week), but it's well worth a visit, and is a great stop on your way back in if you've decided to drive out somewhere outside of London.Anyway, let's get down to the restaurant itself. Addie's has got great decor but is rather small. Hence, if you're able to book, you should. Staff well, I think 90% of them are incredibly friendly, while there was one who seemed a bit surly and abrupt while taking our order, saying And then? in a rather sharp tone after every item we ordered. Still, the rest of the staff were friendly and smile-y so it wasn't enough to put us off.The food was absolutely divine. I'd gone for the pork neck in tamarind sauce as a side dish and it was delicious. The sauce was very spicy though and almost killed me. My friend's masamman curry was not bad, but he said he'd had better elsewhere. The pad thai, which every Thai restaurant has to serve, was good, and looked very pretty with an egg lattice over the top. Be sure to mix in the chicken floss and crushed peanuts on the side before eating though. My friend didn't and missed out on the crunchy, savoury extras.Our bill wasn't too bad. Came up to \u00a322 each including a drink and service for quite a fair bit of food.",

I was convinced to come here after a friend said this was the only Thai spot she would order from when the craving for Thai hit back in her uni days - so I had high hopes.I got the sea bass sweet chili and she got the satay chicken. The sea bass was okay, nothing exceptional. I had the same dish at another Thai restaurant in southwark and that was much better than this one (the fact that I remember it now is testament to that). The breading was a bit too thick for my tastes, the sauce too sweet, but the spiciness was right on target. It wasn't a bad meal, just didn't live up to the high expectations I had. I'd definitely come back and eat here again, as prices aren't bad and other peoples' dishes looked delicious - maybe I'll go for the recommended steamed fish next time.",

The food is authentic and well prepared, and service is both efficient and friendly. Although the only Thai eaterie in the area, it nevertheless provides very good value (around \u00a315-20 a head, including beverages). The interior is decorated in warm, pleasing tones, giving it a very cosy ambience. The only gripe I have is that their vegetarian selection is (in common with many Thai restaurants) rather limited, although fish enthusiasts will be spoiled for choice. It's worth trying to book ahead if you can, as they are always very busy, and packed at week-ends. ************************ Update: 17-04-2008 Another excellent meal, and two courses with three bottles of wine between 4 of us came to just under \u00a325 each, including service. They will now do tofu veggie versions of many of the main courses - just ask. Booking now seems essential even on a Monday.",

    "text": "Surprised that Addie's hasn't garnered a few more reviews! \u00a0I first discovered this place about 8 years ago through a Thai friend of my sister's and it's always come through for me. \u00a0I thought that the quality dropped off a tiny bit a couple of years ago, but the last time I went, it was as good as ever. \u00a0Also, they've redecorated the front of the restaurant - before, I frequently managed to walk right past the place and have to double back due to the total lack of visible signage (and the utterly forgetable pinky-beige paint at the front).The inside of the restaurant is low-lit and fairly quiet, so I guess it'd be a decent date location (not that I know about these things). \u00a0I also like that it smells like jasmine rice too which is really pleasant.I really like the curries here - the flavour balance is just right and the sauce is really moreish (I can't say that with all curries...) and they have a decent amount of chilli without being excessive (and I'm sure they'd happily oblige if you want more). \u00a0I also really like the salads here too, although they are HOT - it'll take 30 seconds for the birdseye to kick in, but you'll know when it does. \u00a0The raw prawn salad is particularly tasty - I know many people are sceptical about eating them, but they have such a unique, almost buttery texture which is lovely in combination with the crunchiness of the rest of the salad. \u00a0For the carnivores amongst you. the Weeping Tiger steak is tasty too - I love the marinade. \u00a0Lastly, for hot beverage lovers, you should try the lemongrass tea - it's really refreshing.Value-wise, it's excellent for the quality and presentation of the food. \u00a0The portions aren't as big as you'd get in some other places, but they're not piddling either. \u00a0Most starters are around \u00a34.50, curries are generally under \u00a37 (although they don't come with rice), and main dishes are in the range of \u00a37-\u00a310, so it's pretty reasonable.By far and away my favourite place to eat around Earl's Court - I admit I've neglected it a bit in recent years, but it's some of the best Thai I've had in London and I'd recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat.",

    "text": "Addie's is one of the ten or so Thai restaurants in London that cater mostly for the Thai community rather than for native Thai-food lovers. They have an authentic menu including Isaan street-food, and a downstairs area for karaoke parties. The decor is quite cool and modern with gorgeous little scale models of street-food stalls framed on the walls. The place is frequented heavily by London's Thai students - so much so that booking in advance at the weekend is essential. The whole restaurant is buzzing with cool young Thai kids who've spent their parent's money on Kings Road early that day. You can't move for boutique shopping bags.But on to the food and drink... the Thai food is great, but not London's best and the prices here feel a good 20 to 30% more than many equivalents. We had the Isaan sausage (gorgeous but I'd give it London's bronze), a fermented fish som tum (disappointing), fried cat fish in morning glory (wonderful), a spicy lemongrass and pork soup (very sharp) and grilled pork neck (very tasty but not stellar). With rice, sticky rice and a beer and Thai iced tea it came to about 45 pounds.Addie's is definitely worth a try, especially with a big group. Book early and plan to party.",

    "text": "Spectacular Thai food and added bonus - it cleared my sinuses! Great location just steps away from Earl's Court tube stop. We picked this restaurant because it was just around the corner from our flat and the reviews were stellar.Deceivingly large dining area because you walk into a shotgun style room lined with table-tops on one side. But wait there is a whole other dining area downstairs. Very hip, chic decor but not over the top. Awesome stenciled wall art of Bangkok street scenes. The room was predominantly filled with Asian clientele which signaled that we were in for a treat. Very friendly staff and loads of regulars flowing in/out with big hugs-n-kisses reception. Another clear message that this place will kick ass!We had Royal Addie's Platter to start. This is my new 'last meal' before they shoot me up with electricity. Mix of fish cakes, prawns, chicken satay, spring rolls and moneybags... deep-fried chicken/prawns in pastries. Lordy. Served with a trio of dipping sauces, this was so delicious I was worried the mains might pale in comparison. Perfect crunch on the fried items. Not refried, but prepared fresh to order despite the busy turnover. The fish cakes were sublime. They were flavorful and the perfect texture and left me wanting to place another order. For \u00a311.50, you can't go wrong. Honestly, get this and a main to split for 2 and you'll not leave hungry. I had the Salt with Chili Soft Shell Crab for \u00a312.95 and Man had the Chicken Masaman Curry for \u00a312.95 - not sure of that price. Damn Vince (Van Gogh). Masterpiece. If soft shell crab is cooked improperly, it tends to get chewy and dull-flavored. This crab dish ranked as good as those I've ordered in New England. Yummy. I am normally not a curry lover because coconut milk gets richer with each bite to the equivalent of overindulging on creme brulee. This was not too overpowering and the chicken was incredibly tender. I loved this dinner so much that upon our return home, we researched the most authentic Thai restaurant local to Columbus and found one. Yelp coming soon. Addie's is great all around! Great value. Great location. Great staff. I''ll be craving this place something awful.",

The place is relatively small, but the food didn't take too long to arrive so I can't imagine having to wait too long for a table. My friend and I both got the green curry and asked for it not be too spicy. WORD OF ADVICE: the lady next to us who said she always has spicy food could not even finish a quarter of her curry due to how spicy it was. When they say a dish is spicy, they really mean it! The curry was delicious, but I could have done without the appetizer platter. For how much you pay it isn't that much food and it wasn't particularly flavorful. The actual entree's were so much more flavorful and delicious.",

Few may contradict but many will likely agree with me that this is the best Thai restaurant in London.Starting with service, upon entry we were warmly welcomed with big smile by the hostess. Oh what a magic this sweet gesture does to guests especially from stoic inhabitants of London. Nextly, while seated to the dinner table, I noticed the calm and zen-like ambiance and decor they created here. It is a typical but good quality of any Thai establishments that Addie's incorporated at the restaurant which I think makes dinning experience enjoyable. As for the food, they have quite a huge selection. It can be overwhelming to those who are new to thai menu but personally I believe it is better to have more \u00a0choices than be limited. You can always ask for recommendations from your servers who are very attentive and accommodating. Luckily, we knew what we want and went for it. We had Pad thai, beef ginger stir fry, panang curry and fried rice. Each one of the dishes were perfection. All were tasteful and flavorful that it nicely stimulated our palate and filled tummy. To our surprise, the prices here are on the good value thus making us extra happy to find this cafe. We will definitely be back to explore more their menu.",

The price tag is rather low or moderate, compared to the average price at other Thai restaurants, but you get a decent portion.After several visits, I've already tried around 80% of what's on the menu, and I can say that the quality is very consistent. Therefore, instead of the predictable Green Curry, Pad Thai, I would suggest you go out of your way and try something you've never heard of or tried before.The desserts menu might be less interesting. My friends said that the banana in coconut milk was too sweet for them, but it was fine for me.Overall, highly recommended if you're looking for the authentic Thai food in London.",

The guy came by and told me I didn't have to eat fast, it's hot, don't burn yourself, which I thought was funny. I was just eating fast because I was hungry and the rad nah was super tasty. The ambiance is nice too, clean and modern yet cozy with warm lighting.",

I travel to Thailand quite a bit so I know what the food should really taste like. My husband and I ordered a few things and I have to say the food was delicious. I was slightly disappointed with the vegetable and tofu in my vegetarian curry but the sauce was lovely. The rice was really good and soft, which is super importAnt. Thai iced tea was just like the ones in Thailand which was nice thirst quench for me. The servers were super busy running around but super nice. The gentleman that took order spoke Thai and I believe most of the servers do which is a good sign! I would def come back!",

In the menu under rice dishes, I went for the \"Khao Pad Ka-Prao\" (8.00). I got this in the minced chicken option. What makes it \u00a0taste good is that it's mildly spicy, the added garlic, basil leaves and chopped chili gives its Thai flavor. I only wish the portions were bigger though, it does get addicting and you wanting to get a bit more. \"Morning Glory\" (6.95). Because this was so flavorful, its probably one the best stir fried veggie plate I've tasted in quite a long time. You can see the sauce as the base of the spinach and it tasted sweet and salty. If you're in need of a vegetarian meal I suggest this, it was delicious.\"Tamarind Duck\" (9.95). This tasted okay, the downside was that the meat tasted dry and the tamarind sauce was on the sour side. Other than that it's not too bad. The service we got that night was good, they were attentive and fast. The atmosphere was lively and it looked like a popular dinner hangout place. The environment here has a modern feel to it with its lighting and decorations. For locals and tourists alike if Thai is your thing, it impressed me and I hope it impresses you.",

A few couples were already sat waiting for a table..30 minutes was the estimated wait, to avoid the torrential rain we agreed.Luckily ten minutes later we were beckoned to a table. This wasn't the biggest place in \u00a0the world, it was like a run way to the kitchen.The first waiter was polite, and took our drinks order of coke and tsingao beer. We turned to the menus, which was cheap considering we were in kensington. Spicy prawn crackers, prawn & pork dumplings were ordered as a starter. For mains a spicy seafood ramanesque soup , and chicken fried rice were also chosen.Unfortunately the prawn crackers did not arrive with the dumplings, which were average..these were chased when the mains were brought out, which the chef knocked out quickly.My soup had a very flavoursome broth, spiced perfectly. However the flat \u00a0rice noodles were flavourless and I could count the pieces of seafood on one hand. My friends rice dish just looked bland.When I looked around , other dishes looked tastier..but what added the salt to the wound was the change in service. The waiter was so rude, especially after I paid the 3% service charge. Even the adjacent couple raised their eyebrows.Overall, mediocre food, with very inconsistent service. I personally don't understand it's high rating.",

Sort of lacking in fruits and vegetables, but that's a whole other thing. Basically, we were missing Asian food and noodles. Found this place on yelp near our hotel and I'm very glad I did. You know it's going to be good when you see all the local Asian population at the restaurant and when there's people waiting for a table. Good thing I read the reviews and called ahead to make a reservation!Anyways, went in for our reservation and ordered a Milky Way (Thai iced tea) and a chicken pad thai. Both were amazingggg and I tried some of my friend's pad see ew as well and that was good too. Ended up getting the sticky rice with banana and ice cream for dessert and that was also super good. If I lived around here and needed a go to Thai food place, this would be it. Pretty cheap for London standards I think at 7.50 for the noodle dishes, fast service, and great food.",

It's apparently known for having Thai high society living in London come through. The d\u00e9cor is not over the top glamorous, but it's not hole-in-the-wall either; it's comfortable, clean, and also a little cozy.They are apparently known for their Weeping Tiger dish, \u00a0which is sizzling sirloin served Thai style. We also got some chicken and prawn toast and an egg omelette, as well as both the egg fried rice and the sticky rice. I enjoyed everything; we got the chicken and prawn toast first, and it totally hit the spot. I've only had prawn toast prior to this... can't say I really tasted the chicken, but it was good nonetheless. The egg fried rice was good on its own, but the sticky rice was recommended to accompany the Weeping Tiger and it came in a cute straw container. The steak was not a large portion, but I liked the way it was prepared and the rich soy sauce went very well with rice. The egg was simple but delicious; this would be a good dish to try and make at home, but I have no idea how they get it so tasty!We were in and out of the restaurant within an hour, and I thought it was great for a quick and delicious meal. That's not necessarily something you expect when you have to book a restaurant, but it is indeed very popular. They seem to be part of a group of restaurants with locations in Twickenham, Chiswick, and Hammersmith. I would love to come back and try some more dishes on the menu - there were so many to choose from!",

Service was good and the bill was pretty cheap. They wanted us to have our whole party present before they seated us. The underground seating was a bit chilly.",

    "text": "I've had Thai food all over the world and this was absolutely delicious! On a Saturday night it was busy but not super crowded. They were able to seat me immediately for a late dinner for one. The service is pleasant and prompt. I enjoy being able to see the servers laugh and share moments with the crowd and that's exactly what happened. I ordered the chicken wings for my appetizer. Done expect to fill up on them considering you only get four but those four wings are spectacular. The garlic sauce is perfect, tangy and a little sweet. You taste the garlic but it's not overwhelming. My main dish I had the weeping tiger and a side order of eff fried rice. This dish is one of the best I've ever had. Steak was cooked perfectly and the sauce was even better! The egg fried rice wasn't oily or bogged down with soy sauce making it a wonderful compliment to the weeping tiger steak. I will most certainly return here and recommend it to others.",

    "text": "The food here is amazing - a full range of thai style dishes including some which are very spicy (really Thai style). The best dishes for me are the grilled pork and the stir fry chilli with morning glory, and the mango sticky rice for dessert, but everything I have tried has been very nice! I have been to alot of Thai restaurants in London but I think this is the best!",
