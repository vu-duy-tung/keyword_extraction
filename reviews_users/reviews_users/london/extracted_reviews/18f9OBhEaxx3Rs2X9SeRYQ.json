You can always add more dishes as you go if you're hungry, greedy or just in love with the food.If you want something different but great try the sundried spinach side dish.It's not a drawback for me, but it is a little small so not the place for a huge group.Lastly the owner and staff are wonderful.",

    "text": "Described by the owner, Sam, as 'one pot comfort food, like we make at home,' Meraz Cafe is exactly the type of place I'd go when I'm missing my grandma's cooking. Though it's located a stone's throw away from my flat (and indeed, so close that I saw my landlord there when I went in for a meeting), I'd never before seen or heard of this delightful haven of Bengali cookery. When there, I sampled the chana masala, puri, and a cabbage and veg curry. The chana and curry were spiced similarly (with ginger, garlic, and mustard seeds - very much like home!), with a tomato and oil based sauce of medium-thickness, and no cream (!). The cabbage curry had evenly julienned slivers of carrot and onion, which allowed for a very nice distribution of different flavours and textures. Me likey. The only thing that I would have changed was that there was quite a bit of oil in the dish that pooled at the top (I suppose it was an oil-based sauce...), although that's not too different from the food we eat at home, as well. The puri was light and fluffy, but also a bit oily (puri is generally like that, which is why it's not my favourite bready thing to eat, and I always prefer chapati or naan). Lastly, the prices at Meraz Cafe are extremely fair, and even I can afford it on my student budget -- at \u00a32-3.50 for a veggie curry dish, and anywhere from \u00a30.75-2 for a vessel/carb (whether puri, naan, or rice), I have a feeling I will be back here over, and over, and over again. I told Sam he'd have to kick me out for coming to eat here too much, and I plan on making good on that promise.",

    "text": "Just off Brick Lane, this little caf\u00e9 serves home cooked Indian food. The menu is awesome and has authentic options. The waiter (I think the owner) was super friendly and asked how we found out about his place - Yelp of course!!We ordered tandoori king prawns (you get 4 big meaty prawns on a sizzling skillet), and sides of chana massala and sag aloo both of which were amazing. We also had a portion of pakoras (5) and 2 poppadoms to start. Go for a mango lassi to drink...the sensation of the sweet mango and spice from the dishes is always so good!Overall the food was amazing and that was enough for two people. The only comment I'd make is that the food was really salty...we were dying of thirst for the rest of the night. It wouldn't stop me from going again though. I'd just make sure to order water with my lassi ;)",

If you are on a tour of London, you can use the toilets as well. I highly recommend, walk a bit more and go there if you can!",

We ended up here thanks to Yelp and as others have said it's a welcome reprieve away from the clamor of Brick Lane vendors.We started with Sami Lamb appetizer, chopped up lamb with onions that tasted very good. We then shared Chicken Achari, King Prawn biryani (came with veggie side), Saag paneer (think it said Sog Ponir on menu, not sure what correct spelling is) and garlic naan. Every dish was SO good and flavorful. We had a sudden epiphany that we have been going to too many mediocre Indian lunch buffets back home and that THIS is what real, good food of this cuisine (Indian, Bangladeshi) should taste like. Seriously good - best meal of our trip to London.Add to it a clean, bright, ambiance and nice waitstaff plus very reasonable prices - wish we lived In London so we could come all the time!",

Although everything was very good, we all agreed that our favorite dish was the chicken korma. I could have eaten that all day!

We were there in that odd hour between lunch and dinner and so were the only people in the place, and I'm fairly certain that the man who served us was also the chef/cook. Not being wildly hungry and not wanting to lug around leftovers, we ordered one chicken tikka masala along with a garlic naan and a pilau rice. It was the perfect amount of food for two people and we cleaned our plates. The masala was a little on the sweet side and could have been a little spicier, but overall it was a great meal. A bit on the pricy side - one curry, one naan, a side of rice and two waters cost us \u00a320, but since the food was tasty and the ambiance nice we didn't mind.",

Everything was great... Prawns were a good size and cooked to perfection. The sauce of the Masala was incredibly flavorful and probably the best I've ever had. I am not a big fan of Masalas in NY since it tends to be overly buttery and lacking, but the Masala here packed a very flavorful profile punch. \u00a0It had a nice hint of sweetness while not being overly spicy. You'll see all of the neighboring restaurants in this area displaying their gimmicky banners and having their Waiters harass you to solicit business, but not this place. \u00a0It seemed to have a solid reputation and was full of locals/regulars during Thursday afternoon lunchtime.Will definitely be back the next time I am in town!",

I finally stopped by for lunch with not too large of an appetite so I ordered the chicken curry with pilau rice. Seeing as I was the only person in the restaurant, the service was good as far as ordering my food goes. Upon placing my order, the first thing I noticed was seeing the pilau rice go straight into the microwave. My immediate thought was, alright, understandable as business is quite slow right now, but I could already sense it wouldn't be anything in the way of exquisite. Both dishes came out, and in comparison to several other surrounding curry houses the chicken curry dish was fairly small (approximately 6-7 pieces of chicken). Overall, the taste was very mediocre; nothing to write home about. I'd recommend spending your money elsewhere for a quality tasting dish.",

What I love about food in London is the portions are perfect (as opposed to Everything-is-bigger-in-texas portions). This restaurant is hard to find without word of mouth.

I've had homemade Indian food many times and this was even better. The dishes were rich in flavor, but not overwhelming or heavy. The rice and naan were perfect as well. The sauce they served with the biryani was also delicious. The host/server/owner was friendly and had a conversation with us asking where we were visiting from etc. We loved it so much, we went back the next day.

    "text": "It was hard to choose where to go on Brick Lane with all the many curry options and hosts beckoning and reviews blurring. I'm so glad we chose this place. A little off Brick Lane made it nice and quiet, not quite as in-your-face. And the food-the food! It was all really excellent. The curry and pakora were both really great. Tip: get something with their unique special red sauce on it. My wife got a lamb \"snack\" with it and it was superb. The server was also really great in a nice, distant joking kind of way. I'm not sure it's the headlining curry place on Brick Lane, but I'd be surprised if the food was any better elsewhere.",

    "text": "Service was friendly, ambiance was clean and modern, and they have wall chargers. But the chicken korma was way too sugary and the chickpeas were incredibly salty. The waiter offered papadum like it was free, whisked it away before we were done eating it leaving us with flakes of papadum in our hands, and then charged 3 pounds for it. My sister asked for tap water, I asked for bottled, and he brought us both bottled. Last, the portions are small. We will not be back.",
