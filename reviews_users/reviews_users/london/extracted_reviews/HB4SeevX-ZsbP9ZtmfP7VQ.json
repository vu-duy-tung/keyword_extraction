    "text": "Possibly the best pub in London! HONEST! As previous reviews have said, it was a faveourite haunt of the local bohemian population (including Bacon and Thomas), and it the french resistance did come here (De Gaulle was a regular!). These days, the same flock still go here, and it is nicer than some of the other pubs, as the soho-media-types are still a little scared of going here! You can also often find the likes of Ian Hislop and other writers from Private Eye lurking about for a post-work drink! Another point I have to mention is the drinks, they are great! A proper selection of decent wines, good beers (served in traditional french half-measures) and cider. For some reason people love the cider here. Whether cider is from breton or strongbow, its still battery acid, just slightly milder in taste! Go and buy the bottled belgan beer, Duvel instead (\u00a33.50). Its got 8.5% alcahol, and it tastes much better than icky cider! I love this pub, possibly because we used to sing carol songs to the regulars around xmass when I went to primary school just around the corner!",

Your place had fantastic photos and memorabilia adorning the wall. We had a great time, didn't we? I'm so sorry I left you when sexy little Sis text me to let me know she would have me.

But instead of the volume of people becoming a deterrent it actually adds to the ambiance and experience.The crowd of regulars is what makes up the majority of French House's patrons and after work you'll be hard pressed to find a set inside. Thankfully you can take your pint outside to their little standing room only patio. The patio is only wide enough for 2-3 people to stand side by side (read: Crunched together) but runs the entire length of the pub.Thankfully, the ledge is there to rest your beer and the hooks allow you to hand your belongings while you socialize. The pints of London Ale were great but the French Cider was what really stole the show here. Served in a 500ml (0.5L) bottle, the flavour was fantastic, a great item to share and deffinitely boozy enough to make it worth whatever price we paid!",

Since it was 4 of us \u00a0out for St Patrick's day we slowly managed to get seats one by one at a rate of one new seat per hour but we did manage to all be seated by the end.The service is quite quick and the staff is friendly until you make the one fatal error, which is answer your phone. Apparently they have a 'no phone calls policy and if you happen to miss the tiny chalkboard behind the bar close to the ceiling (They had to point it to me because it took me a while to see where it was) and you pick up your phone they will come up to you at your seat and ask you to hang up or get out of the pub.To be honest I think that's ridiculous as you are risking losing your seat just to be able to tell one of your other friends who's a bit late how to find you in the pub. It's not like I was there to spend the night talking on the phone and if it was up to me I would have left right there and then.The other thing that I thought was a bit annoying is that they do not do pints, so you can only buy your beer in half pint glasses. I went to the bar, asked for a pint, they said they don't do it and then I eventually had to ask for two half pints. I think it's a gimmick to sell the beer at a higher price because the price of the two halves combined is higher than the price of a normal pint in any other place but you don't realise it because you are paying less per individual drink.In any case, I did have a good night despite those issues, but that's because I was with good friends and definitely not because of the venue. I recommend looking for a different pub if you're in the area, as there's lots to chose from so you don't have to deal with that drama.",

We sat on the first floor (above ground level), where it was slightly quieter and lower key as well. House red was good. Service was just average -- we had to go order and bring our own glasses back to the table. The space can be quite tight, so not the best place if you have a lot of things with you!",

Right away, I was struck by the fact that the entire bar seemed to be engaged in a rather loud and jovial conversation with the two bartenders.I interrupted order a small glass of house red (\u00a33.50) and sat down. I was happy to see I wasn't alone in my bar book reading - another patron soon bellied up at the bar and pulled out her novel. Meanwhile, it seemed that everyone who arrived and left knew the bartenders by name. Nice to find such a locals favorite in such a touristy area.Funny enough, as I was literally reading other reviews regarding the friendliness of this place after checking in, I was soon asked by the next table what I was reading. \u00a0This turned into a good hour of friendly, silly conversation. Just what I needed.",

It feels out of time both because of the decor, the no phone policy, the patrons, the staff, the building, well the entire place is like from somewhere else. It is definetely bohemian, anarchists looking due to its patrons. There is no music in there, just small bars, one downstairs, one upstairs. I heard they serve food but never saw any. Only drinks, drinks and drinks all around. Pints of beers (only 4 on tap), were guiness, 1664, bitter and stella(not sure on this one), and funny thing, they come in small glasses. Half pint, priced at 2 pounds. You end up going at the bar every 2 minutes, or you buy 2 in a row, or...you slow your drinking habits. You choose. Very charming unique place in the heart of Soho that has also a lot of French related stories, which can always be pleasant to hear for a French. Nowadays it only bears the name, but as nothing French about it, only the flags.",

Nothing funnier than ordering a pint and thinking to yourself, \"Wow.. that's pretty affordable..\" and then have it served in a half-pint (aka child size cup)... a French thing?It's a traditional (closes at 11pm) and tiny place... gets pretty crowded by the bar (aka cozy and intimate) so it may test your patience. Lots of great beer.. the guinness was good, but not the real stuff :(Although it doesn't look like anything French, my buddy who took me says that apparently the place did at least house or serve as a meeting point for the French resistance in London, hence the name... All in all, it's a pretty cool and chill hangout spot... I didn't try the restaurant, but heard good things... so I'll have to save that for a followup review",

    "text": "Admittedly, my experience of French House was very different than the average one. On my French friend's birthday he decided to gather everyone here for a pint to start the night. However, he failed to realize it was Pride, and all of Dean Street was a complete zoo full of people. So, the pub itself was packed with people, and we stood outside to enjoy a few pints and a few shots and then everyone else carried on when I went home because I really like sleeping. However, I did take a walk through the pub, and ordered my drinks inside, so I can make a small commentary on my experience: aside from the name, I'm pretty sure it's not necessarily a french place; there's very little space inside, though I imagine that on a cold winter's night, it's a very charming place to tuck into; they serve mostly half-pints, though on special occasions like Pride, they go big for the masses.Great location, nice spin having a French focus, and a nice and quick enough barstaff. Pretty good, as these things go.",
