    "text": "Very delicious hand pulled noodles in London's theatre area. For the price and the amount of work it takes to make the noodles, it is a steal. Their specialty is the beef soup or beef stew with noodles. You definitely have to try what they're known for. Try that, or some of their stir-fried noodles with duck. It is awesome. If you're having trouble, ask one of the wait staff. They're more than happy to walk you through their menu.They have food in heating trays for take-away as well. I didn't try it as it didn't look all that appetizing.It is important to note that if you eat in, it is communal style. You're seated in on tables with benches and may have to share with other patrons.",

The sesame seed chicken is sweet and delicious. Definitely some authentic Chinese food and you know it's real when they ask you how you want your noodles because they make it right at the spot for you. I recommend getting the thick noodles instead of the regular!",

    "text": "The very definition of a hidden gem. OK, I may be a little bit of a food snob and had walked past this place multiple times on the basis that it's located in tourist central and secondly, they have trays of ready cooked takeaway Chinese food at the entrance to sell to passing touristsSo, it came as a surprise when London Yelpers who I respect raved about it. I triple checked that it was the same 'Noddle Bar' that I had walked past multiple timesHowever, they gave me the key to the secret kingdom here, which I'm going to share with you. The good stuff is in the back. So, you have to puff up your chest, look confident and stride past the trays of ready cooked food and either ask for a table in mandarin or point to the back in an assured manner. Then, they'll let you eat inYou'll have a menu thrust at you, which has a bewildering choice of dishes and on my first visit, an impatient waitress tapping her pad almost as soon as I had sat down. There are useful pictures on the walls and on the menu but perhaps, the biggest clue as to what to eat here is in the name of the restaurant - noodles!Another clue comes from seeing the chefs at the open plan kitchen, hand pulling and hand carving fresh noodles in front of your eyes. These can be served in soup, fried or cooked probably in any way you wish and served with different meats or vegetables. I've enjoyed both soup and fried noodles, both for very reasonable prices.The place is tiny and you'll have to share tables but to find fresh, authentic food in the heart of tourist central like this is a goldmine",

All of the soups are cheap and the service is QUICK. My only irritation is that they have picnic tables and try and cram as many people at these tables, which is uncomfortable when it's family style. If you're craving asian food, this is definitely the spot to go :)",

Yes, you have the noodle man showing incredible skills, yes, it's almost cheaper than a beer, yes service is super fast, but it was nothing breathtaking.They have a basement where you can seat, so do enter in the restaurant even if it seems full, they may have some seating inside (and either way, they will push out off the door somebody else!).We ordered two different kind of noodles (at the end, we wanted to be sure the noodle man was working!) with two different protein, sliced beef and duck, both dishes were tasty, but they completely missed the wow factor, the thing that makes you say \"WOW, I just found a hidden gem!\", just boring chinese street food. The taste was the same as the noodles you can find on the roads in Shanghai, I mean yes I do get this is authentic and so on and so forth, but the dish per-se it's damn boring! I ate too much of those things in my past, and now I want something delicious, not just ordinary!Do come here if you are on a budget as this is a very good place under 10 \u00a3, but it's not worth a travel here!",

ESPECIALLY SINCE LANZHOU IS SO GOOD AND ACROSS THE !#)*)&@ STREET :DStaff was really friendly (speaking Mandarin) and I was recommended the beef noodle soup for 6.5 GBP. F-ing delicious. Soup was spicy without the intent to bring you physical pain, noodles were fun to bite into and the beef was cut into slices instead of chunks, which made for less meat stuck between your molars ;)So happy I got to eat here this last trip and chat with some locals sharing my table.",

I visited the bar with a Taiwanese friend who has eaten her fair share of noodles and we both agreed that the noodle soups we ordered were absolutely delicious. I would go back in a wink to eat another bowl of that liquid delight, not to forget the freshly pulled noodles that were absolutely divine. For the price you pay, you really get great food value.But when I go back, I'll make sure I'll go alone. The simple reason being that the restaurant is rather anti-social. We were asked to move places three times, which is simply odd when you are eating. On top of that my friend and I had different eating paces. When my friend finished her dish she was asked to pay and leave right away, while I was clearly still in the process of eating. We refused. Not only was I stared at for the remainder of the dinner, my friend also perfectly understood the less than friendly comments that were made about us by the waiters in Mandarin. So when you go, go for the food. Don't go to socialize.",

I was in Paris a couple days ago before I tried this place and I was really craving a bowl of noodle soup right when I got to London! They have an extensive menu and the price is reasonable considering the conversion rate of pounds to USD. 7-8\u00a3 for a bowl of noodle is probably the most reasonably priced meal I had in London. There was a line when I went around 6pm on a Friday. But we got seated within 5-10 minutes. They are pretty efficient because you can order while you are in line so by the time you get seated, you only have to wait for another 5 minutes until you get your food.I got the noodle soup with roasted duck and vegetables. Their handmade noodles taste amazing! They have this hot chili sauce that you have to add to your noodle! It adds so much flavor and a kick to it. If I am ever back in London, I'll definitely come back and eat here.This place is in Leicester Square and there's always things happening around here at night so it's a good place to eat before you go out for the night!",

    "text": "Finally made my way to Lanzhou Noodle Bar for some fresh hand pulled noodle soup. It's what they well known for yet I can't help but feel sad when I see tourists or people unfamiliar with the cuisine going for a cheap container of their pre cooked buffet section. \u00a0Take the hint and order the freshly made hand pulled noodles instead.The place felt like I entered a nursery with their bright colour walls of yellow, red and green and laminated printout of the food. Staff were efficient and quick but without the friendliness, which is very typical of a Chinese restaurant. With that in mind and the small canteen style restaurant, condiments on the table, short plastic and wooden stools, it was very reminiscent of canteens in Hong Kong and China.House special vermicelli Oh my beautiful zingy garlicky vinegary salad of thinly sliced cucumbers, carrots, coriander, vermicelli and the novelty of frankfurters too. It was so refreshing, loved the crunchy texture and marinated perfectly. The frankfurters actually worked well adding some meaty sweetest to the dish, to balance out the sourness.Chicken sour spicy la-mian noodles. I didn't expect the broth to be so umami and flavoursome. It had depth and a nice balance sourness as well as a good punch of spice from the chilli without being numbing. The noodles was full of bounce and generous, made long so it provided a really satisfying bite. The wood ear fungus gave a crunch to it and this was contrasted with the softer tofu. The chicken was a bit dry but that was the only compliant I haveStewed beef Dao Xiao Mian (chopped noodles) in soup. The broth was delicious and complex, once again full of flavour and depth. Sadly the noodles weren't as satisfying for me being short and doughy. It felt I spent more time chewing on the noodles than the enjoying the broth with it. Next time I might have it with the La Mian as the beef was spot on being incredibly tender and fragrant, with strong notes of the sweet soy braising marinating sauce. Nice addition of pak choi for a refreshing green taste and crunch.Steamed pork and chive dumplings These were poorly made. The dough was too thick and chewy masking all the flavours of the meatball and the broth inside it. The meatball itself was nice and sweet, well marinated and juicy.Fish ball BBQ skewer and lamb BBQ skewer These were lovely and fragrant. It had a nice kick to it from the spice. The lamb was meaty and lean which was nice compared to all the fatty ones we've had. Fish balls were soft and bouncy with good umami flavours. It was great not to have a minimum order on them too like most places that sell skewers.Chive and egg pieThis was very moreish. I love the doughy thin pastry, pan fried for a little bit of crisp around the edges. It was a bit greasy too but that kept it moist. Inside was a delicious filling of peppery chives mixed with silky eggs.I left so satisfied with Lanzhou Noodle Bar. For just \u00a36.50 for each of the noodle soups it makes me question why a simple miso ramen can cost double that. It's cool how you can see the noodles made in the open preparation kitchen by the chef and the skilled involved. Menu is actually quite extensive covering mostly northern Chinese food so if you're hungry you can always add it along to your noodle as a side like what we did. Looks like I will be back soon.",

Lanzhou falls squarely in mainland/northern chinese cuisine. It's hand pulled noodles are freshly made and the sauce is super yum. There are all kinds of choices for everyone. I was excited to see that they served garlic and pepper marinated cucumbers, which is my favorite appetizer of all time. They don't serve water which is fine if you're getting a soup with noodles. The restaurant is cramped, yes, but it feels pretty authentic that way. The crampness reminded me of many of the street restaurants I have been to in Asia and honestly, whenever I am in Asia, I prefer street food over fancy restaurants because it tastes way better. Lanzhou is also one of the rare places that take card (yay!).",

The bowl is packed with so much MSG (flavour enhancers, you'll know it's jammed with the bad stuff after you go running to find a drink after dining here!), fatty cuts of meat (stewed beef is the recommendation and 80% of it is fat) and I counted one slither of bok choy (yes, one!). Most of the bowl is filled with broth that's way too oily to drink. The handcut noodles are impressive and lives up to the hype. If you're not a fan of MSG and really oily/fatty food, I'm afraid I couldn't recommend Lanzhou Noodle Bar. Service is inattentive and poor. The minute you put down your chopsticks, there's already a table standing next to you waiting for you to dash out ASAP. I understand that seat space is tiny and cramped, but it'd be nice not having to climb over bodies to exit the restaurant. You'd be better off paying an extra \u00a35 and grabbing a bowl of ramen nearby. Can I suggest Kanada-Ya? They have rad ramen and it's a consistent five stars from me.",

This noodle joint is a tiny hole in the wall, super casual with cramped seating, but it wasn't anything I didn't already expect. My boyfriend and I ordered the stir fried hot and sour beef la mian (hand pulled noodles), as well as the pork sparerib dao xiao mian (hand cut noodles) in soup. Food came quickly within ten minutes and was super fresh. The hand pulled noodles were definitely the preferred style between the two as they were more al dente and retained a light bounce. I normally really like dao xiao mian, but I found that since they were in soup, they ended up getting overly doughy/overdone quicker than I anticipated. The pork sparerib was crisp and well executed, and the hot and sour beef had a nice level of acidity and spice. Overall, a quick cheap eat that hits the spot. Just bear in mind that it's definitely a no frills type of establishment.",

I ordered the Mu-er cold dish as it's one of my favourite things to have in China. As I was digging into it, we saw not one, but 2 very long strands of hair. They were nice enough to make me a new one, but I was rather put off from the initial dish already and probably nothing could have actually made the situation better. In hindsight: Go for the noodles. Maybe try the lamb skewers. But stay away from the cold dishes.",

Then they tried to add on a charge to pay by card without warning in advance so had to trek off to go get cash and come back. There's no warning of this charge also when you're queuing for a table - which is when you're most easily able to pop off to get some cash.Yup, damn good noodles but somehow was left with a bitter taste in my mouth from the p**s poor service.",

    "text": "BEWARE! I've always trusted yelp and its users to guide me to the right restaurants, but this time I have been severely misled. I had high hopes for this place because of the great reviews I read, and being a noodle enthusiast I have to try all the (good) noodle places in London. The place was packed, and I ordered their \"signature\" soup, the beef la mien (not to be confused with the Japanese ramen), when the order came, the noodles were coagulated, and beef slices were tough and chewy, and the worst part was the soup, it was full of MSG, and full of sodium too. I asked for a glass of tap water to relieve the yucky taste my tongue and throat, and the answer I got from the rude waiter was: we don't sell tap water here. Although the noodles were \"cheap\" by Leicester Square standards (\u00a36.50), I found it to be a giant waste of my money because I couldn't bear to eat the rest of my soup/noodle.",

I was part of large group that wandered into this tiny gem just around the corner from Chinatown and thought \"oh crap, this isn't going to be good..\" that was after being led through the main dining room/restaurant, down tiny, steep stairs, and into a second, closet-like dining room in the basement. We all wondered what we were in for, but after a few rounds of tsingtao we were game for anything. Having filled my stomach with beer, I ordered the breaded sauteed mushrooms.. and OMFG, best mushrooms ever. Seriously. Even people at the table who HATE mushrooms were picking off my plate! Others had noodles (which were freshly pulled as other reviews have mentioned), some had soups.. all in all, everyone agreed that it was fantastic and that we were wrong to have thought we were in for a nice dose of salmonella (which no one had, lol). I definitely will be visiting the next time I'm in London (and will be spreading the word to others!)!",

That's what I've become, even when I'm seven sheets to the wind, I'm thinking about food. Noodle Bar is on Cranbourne St inbetween the twin hells of Leicester Square and Covent Garden and their USP are their Lanzhou-style hand pulled noodles aka la-mian. I stood transfixed watching the noodle maker convert a block of dough into la-mian to go into a bowl of soup with roast duck. Sadly, the roast duck was a bit tired and soup was full of MSG but frankly standards are lower when you're drunk and besides the noodles were a work of art. The other guys I was with couldn't wait for a bowl of noodles so they went for a selection from the buffet counter where lurid sweet and sour pork, beef in black bean sauce, and other take-away classics lurked. I must confess I went for a giant spring roll whose greasiness soaked up yet more of the booze. I need to go back here one day when I'm able to walk in a straight line. eatlovenoodles.blogspot.\u2026",

    "text": "When I discovered that there was a gem of a handmade noodle place by Covent Gardens, I was more than excited to try. This place is located right outside the Leicester Square tube stop. As soon as I walked inside, they greeted me in Mandarin and asked how many people I had with me.We sat down at a long wooden table next to a trio of Chinese college students working on a mound of amazing-looking noodles.We were given menus, and I (having done my Yelp homework) knew to go for the handmade noodles and not any of the typical Chinese fare. Also because I'm obsessed with handmade noodles.After asking the guy next to me what he was eating, I ordered the same: stir-fried knife-cut beef noodles. We also ordered the ji dan jiu cai he zi (egg and leek \"pancake\") to share. My plate came, gloriously heaped with noodles. I reached for the clay pot full of hot chili flakes in oil, dumped a copious amount on my noodles, and dug in.The cramped noodle bar, with its communal tables, fluorescent lighting, and cooks making noodles two feet away from where you're sitting reminded me a lot of noodle shops I went to while in Hangzhou, China.The food was no frills, authentic Chinese at its best. And even better? You can get a massive portion of noodles for under \u00a37.100% recommend if you're in London and looking for quick, cheap, tasty, authentic bite.",

It's a simple noodle shop where the front has the cooks making the noodles and in the back, there are some communal tables. Overall, the place could fit probably 10 people and you would be sharing tables. But I was seated right away when I entered.

With how overcooked it was, it might have been the previous day's leftovers. The knife-cut noodles were too inconsistent. Usually, knife-cut noodles are good because of the little inconsistencies in thickness, and therefore, texture, but these were too widely ranging. Most of the pieces were too thin, which made it like eating little bits of noodles the thickness of dumpling skins. The remaining pieces were extremely thick, which made for lots of QQ, but also just too doughy. I would normally always recommend the knife-cut noodles over pulled noodles, but I say go with the pulled noodles here.Stewed beef la mian (pulled noodles)Beef was very tender and tasted marinated, noodles were good. Broth was good. Stick with this one.Cash only.7.50GBP for soup with pulled noodles. 7.90GBP for soup with knife-cut noodles.

It was tasty, delicious, filling, well-priced, and reminded me of home. :)Seating is not so great--I sat at a long, slim table against a wall beside a friend and a stranger, but I still really enjoyed the meal.

But there was a table for 4 with only three people it. They grabbed a stool, sat it next to the table, and told us that was where we were going to sit. Cool! And kind of crazy--the other people at our table only spoke Chinese. But that was actually kind of nice because then my wife and I could talk and feel like it was our own private conversation still.We ordered some fried noodles ( I don't remember how to smell the name).

Now on to the noodles, they were aldente, you can feel the gluten break as you chew on the noodles, the broth/soup was seasoned just right (I dont do spicy but, heck if you need spice, they have the real spicy oil -'La yiou', sprinkle to your hearts delight!). \u00a0And much as it wouldn't be anything special in China or most parts of Asia, it was extremely special in London, where it hit the spot and all my weary muscles were soothed away.",

He spoke Mandarin to me, spoke Mandarin back to him. All fine and dandy.Disgusting fact: No wonder they were shut down by health authorities in 2014. They had a mice infestation. But just today while I waited for my takeaway outside the door, I saw the chef start cooking squid. He had a huge tub of it (like those washing tubs) and he dropped some on the floor. Yes you guessed it, he picked it up from the floor and threw it into the wok.Taste: Yes, their noodles are made fresh. Yes their broth is really good with lots of flavour. I ordered the beef brisket (most people on yelp seems to have done that) as it was recommended by the guy at the door and I though there was a lot of noodles, there was enough beef that I was happy. They only gave me 2 pieces of veg though and I really wanted more of that.Price: \u00a36.50 for beef brisket hand pulled noodles. Not bad for the price. I was confused why so many people think this is cheap though. This is pretty standard price for China Town lunch meals.",

They seated us with two other parties of two at a table in the very back, and within about 10 minutes of butt-to-chair we had our food. Service Note: The lady who took our order seemed very good-natured, if rather curt. But the noodles! I had the Roasted Duck Soup Noodle and it was excellent! The broth was super flavorful, obviously made from scratch, and had just enough of a white pepper kick to feel really authentic. Also, super super plus for me was that the broth wasn't too sweet. I can't always handle that note in Cantonese soups, but this broth was managed to pull it off beautifully. The one bad thing was that there were only about four pieces of duck topping, but I guess that's about as much as 6 pounds will get me.",

This place was actually recommended by my father, for he heard about it through its reputation.In actuality, I found it to be just mediocre. Granted I got takeaway, and I don't think that I got the full experience in that form. The broth that came with the noodles didn't resemble the exact flavor of the broth in Lanzhou, but that could probably be attributed to the differences in water. The noodles themselves were fine and the beef that I got with it was tasty as well. There were some elements missing, such as radishes, that I usually saw in Lanzhou noodles, so that was slightly disappointing. Next time, I'll make sure to dine in, so that I can get it in a bowl.

    "text": "So I came here based purely on the Yelp reviews - and I was not disappointed. Not being Asian, it's slightly daunting to enter a restaurant like this. For starters, the sign above the door is in Chinese (I presume!) and just says Noodle Bar in English. So we walked past it on the other side of the street to start with. Then to say that we stand out once inside is an understatement!That being said, with Yelp on our side, we were confident that we were in for some good eats. We avoided the offer of the buffet and opted for the hand pulled noodles instead. There were no seats upstairs so we went downstairs, and we moved around to our own table eventually. We both ordered fried noodles, one plate of char-siu pork and one sliced beef. In the end, we couldn't work out what was better. We also got a side of pork and chive fried dumplings (we went for everything fried - it was blue Monday after all). These were also really good - and you get a crazy large portion for \u00a35. In the end though, we couldn't finish any of the plates of food despite it all being delicious.A great \"hidden\" place that we would never have visited without Yelp, and now I feel like I had some proper Chinese food for once. Great stuff. So two massive plates of fried noodles, two cokes and a portion of dumplings came to just under \u00a322, a real bargain for the area.",

Go in, get a seat (if you can) and just order the noodles.

You can see the noodles being hand made, and the service is quick and food tasty.

Heaps of delighted tourists loading up plates with gooey orange meats at the all-you-can-eat isn't quite what I'm looking for.Glad I checked Yelp and popped into this little noodle shop (err, bar?). There is indeed a final station of hot counter food to ensnare you, but walk on by that and be astounded by the noodle soups they do at the benches in the back.I noticed all the other Chinese folks were getting the knife-cut noodles with slow cooked beef, so I knew I couldn't go wrong. Watched the chef slice and dice 'em up fresh, and after a few dollops of the chili sauce, the steaming bowl of noodles was perfect. Big chunks of meltingly soft beef with a hint of tendon, and the broth itself isn't just a faceslam of MSG.A meal on the heavier side, but great to warm you up! Definitely coming back, and the prices are reasonable (around \u00a36 for everything).",

And I'm shocked because Noodle Bar is a hole-in-the-wall on one of the most touristy, high-traffic areas in Leicester Square...which is the last place you'd expect cheap, authentic Chinese soup.As soon as you walk in, you're rushed to a communal table in the back. The air is filled with the clanging of pots and the slapping of dough against the counter as the noodles are made fresh. Within minutes, you are face-to-face with a piping hot bowl of deliciousness.I always get the La Mian noodle soup - either beef or bbq chicken. Add a little red chili sauce and vinegar = PERFECTION. The steamed pork dumplings also rival ones I've had in Chinatown SF. Whenever I'm in London, I come here at least once a week. I'm usually one of the few non-Asian peeps up in here, which is always a good sign that a place is truly authentic.I miss you Noodle Bar!",

    "text": "How do you rate a place that has such good food but such awful service? I just took the average here, but it really depends on which component you value more.I'd been wanting to try this place for a while and finally got the chance to today for lunch. When I got there it was already pretty busy but there were still a few seats left at the counter (and maybe downstairs?) so I got seated there right away. Within a minute, the menu was thrown in front of me (yes, THROWN). They have a fairly extensive list of options but clearly their specialty is noodles so I went for the vegetable noodle soup. After ordering with a very curt waitress, I asked another if I could get a glass of tap water. I'm not sure if there was some sort of miscommunication or what, but she brought back a fork...And then when I asked for tap water again in Chinese (thinking there was some sort of language barrier) she just stared for a bit then turned and walked away...Huh? I know I'm not a native Chinese speaker, but I'm not THAT bad. So after my noodles came I flagged down another waitress and asked for tap water, and guess what I got as a response? \"Sorry, no tap water only bottle.\" Wait, how is that possible? Maybe this is just me, but never before have I encountered a restaurant that didn't have tap water. At this point I was pretty whatever about my whole experience and just hoped that the noodles would be good - which they actually were. The noodles were fantastic and clearly homemade, and the soup base/vegetables were great too. Not salty at all and incredibly fresh! So overall, even though the food was good (and the value too - I paid 5 pounds flat for the vegetable noodle soup) I'm sad to say I will not be coming back. I value service a lot in a restaurant experience and this place was just ridiculous. Do NOT come here if you're looking for good service in addition to good food - this place doesn't provide both.",

Food quality, average - noodles were okay, soup base was too sweet. Tasted like instant noodles. Ambiance is average, but expected for a cheap eats place. Dining experience, average for a Chinatown. Upside, orders came quick. Downside, service was limited, didn't even serve water. We had to ask. The restaurant charged an auto 10% service charge and gave VERY minimal service. Would contemplate going back!",

We were a group of 4 and it was quite crammed at the table. We were seated in the basement which looked dingy but that was okay, we were here for the food not the ambiance. We each got a bowl of la-mien noodles which were quite good but broth was too salty. Service was what was expected for a cheap-eat Chinese restaurant. I ordered the sliced beef noodles and they brought out the wrong order but was still tasty (picture attached). Cleanliness is concerning which is why I'm rating it 3 stars; we asked for water and it was very obvious that our water came in styrofoam cups that have been washed with hot water and reused.",

It's a tiny restaurant that's run quite efficiently. We browsed through the menu during our 10 minute wait, and were seated quickly. Hungry and excited, I started to dig into my food only to be terribly disappointed. I ordered a chicken curry plate with steamed white rice; the chicken pieces had a strange texture so I started to take a closer look...RAW/UNDERCOOKED chicken... Are you kidding me? People can get really sick! I stopped eating immediately. Before leaving, I pointed out that the chicken was raw/undercooked and the employee rolled her eyes as she grabbed my plate to re-cook the dish (I'm assuming). But I told her it's fine and that we were on our way out. We paid for our meals, crossed our fingers hoping I don't fall ill and no one else does either.",

However, on a subsequent visit they have improved their score so I decided to give it a go. It was a Friday night and this place was bustling at 11pm, from the drunk/clubbing crowd. There was a line and it was a short 5 minute wait as they quickly turned around the tables.You'll be dining communal style (we're kinda used to it) and sharing a table with other people. This place is pretty fast and you can see them make the noodles in front of \u00a0you. I ordered the beef stew hand pulled noodles. It arrived in a matter of minutes and was sooooo good. Be sure to put plenty of that hot sauce in your soup for the best experience. I shared a table with two girls that barely ate their appetizers. They clearly ordered too much (3 appetizers and two soups). Don't do what they did... Total waste. Most of the people eating here are locals and I was the only tourist (or so I thought). It is near Leicester Square which has a bunch of tourists but not too many of them appreciate the fine art of hand pulled noodles. Soooooo good.",

A large portion with plenty of noodles. Spring onion and coriander added to the slices of char siu which had the right flavour, not quite as tender as I have had at some other places but still great. You can also enjoy watching the cook swinging loops of noodle dough back and forth between his outstretched arms to make hundreds of strands of doughy noodle goodness in the tiny open kitchen.Pretty extensive menu with many options (soup noodles are just one section on the menu). Great if you want to eat quickly and be prepared to squeeze up with fellow diners on cramped tables because it's always crowded but come here for the food.

It's definitely a steal since I have not had anything like this in years!!There are only 2 tables that seat 6 people each and then a bar area that seats 3 people. You will likely be forced with people that aren't in your party, but it's a great way to get to know people. I was seated at a table with a party of 3, party of 1, and party of 2.Even better is when it rains, they give you some napkins to help dry off and the service is super quick! I ordered, got my meal, ate, and was out in about 30 minutes. I would definitely recommend trying this place. For those who have never tried knife cut (dao xiao) noodles, I would heavily recommend it. It's well worth it!!",

We are huge beef noodle soup fans and If you want better BNS you have to go to Taipei or China, there's no place in America that can rival this one. Simply amazing, and If you can handle them make sure you get their mixed beef/intestine/tendon noodle soup, all their other BNS varieties are excellent. Their hand-pulled noodle is made per order (128 noodles per bowl, we counted), and the beef was cooked to perfection. We went to this place twice during our 7 days stay and didn't try much else because their beef noodle soup was soooooo good.",

The only reason this place didn't receive five stars is that the cucumbers were a huge let down. I love me some Chinese cucumbers, but I felt as if this place cut up some cucumbers and mixed it with a pinch of salt and dribbling of vinegar. For the price, they could have put in a bit more effort. However, with that being said, I would definitely come back, but forgo the cucumber next time.",

I came here with Yinnie one night after watching The Pride (which was fantastic BTW, courtesy of Yelp!). \u00a0I stuck with my usual stewed beef la mian soup noodles. \u00a0Broth was tasty, beef was still tender, with lots of cilantro, just how I like it! \u00a0Yinnie had the Fujian Peanut Sauce noodles with La Mian (\u00a36) - it was a dry dish with a peanut sauce overtop. \u00a0I'm not usually a huge fan of dry noodles, so I personally didn't think it was that appetizing to me. \u00a0We also shared an order of the garlic cucumbers soaked in Chinese dark vinegar, which was just OK. \u00a0I think they key to this is that the cucumbers need to be soaked a bit longer, and the seeds need to be removed - otherwise the vinegar gets watered down which is what happened here. Onto the 2nd night! We had 4 people with us and ordered the following items:Salt and Pepper Squid, \u00a37 - 8 large pieces of squid, nicely fried, better than any other Chinese resto I've hit up in London. Could have been a bit more spicy, but was easily remedied with their massive pot of chili oil!Stewed Beef Frried Dao Xiao Mian, \u00a37.50 - nicely done, thick chewy noodles fried with chunks of tender beef and sauce. Dan Dan La Mian in soup, \u00a36.50 - it was just OK, couldn't detect much peanuttiness in this dish. \u00a0I probably wouldn't order it again.Fried Pork and Chive Dumplings, \u00a35 - 8 pieces of pan fried dumplings, really good value and tasty! Make sure you dip it in the chinese dark vinegar with chili oil Mapo Tofu, \u00a36.50 (with rice, \u00a32) - spicy tofu dish with some veg in it, sauce wasn't too thick, could have been a bit spicier, but overall a decent dishBeef Tripe in Red Oil, \u00a36 - Just cooked beef tripe sliced thinly, with hot chili oil drizzled on top. \u00a0I've had this cold appetizer several times before, but its generally not my favorite. We all ordered a few drinks, and it came to \u00a314pp, and rolled away full! Again, decent place, would come back in a heartbeat to try other adventurous things on the menu. \u00a0Don't expect much on their service side.. they are pretty efficient in how things are done, our dishes rolled out very quickly, but have an eagle eye watching you, because once you're done, they will tell you to settle the bill up front since there's usually a table waiting.",

I've had a few of the noodles here, my favourite is probably the hot and sour soup with beef slices and knife cut noodles. It's warming, big and satisfying in every way, the price tag is also music to my ears. Sometimes I order sides of dumplings or tofu and although it's nothing to write home about, home being Hong Kong, in this case - it's good enough to compliment the noodles.I can see coming here in the summer being an infrequent occurrence, but I will endeavour to try as long as the price doesn't go up, this place has a firm place in my heart for it's authentic Chinese noodles - I always leave content.",

I need something asian and tasty so I decided to come here. I was not disappointed! I ordered the beef noodle soup with the thinner noodles. They have both types here, thicker knife cut noodles and the thin ones and they are both hand pulled. You can also order them with or without soup. I also decided to add a pickled egg to mine.To me, the broth really makes the soup and it was really flavorful without being salty. I also didn't taste any msg in the soup, it tasted homemade. The beef was also very tender and tasted amazing with some of the chili sauce provided at the table.I was traveling only for a couple days in London so I decided to pay the extra 15% to use my credit card versus paying with cash.

We came expecting fresh, traditional Chinese food. Upon entering were seated on the lower floor, a tiny cramped space with a few tables pushed so closely together that you bump elbows with other patrons around you. The walls are painted neon yellow, and there are no windows. Not one to be scared off by a diver interior, I was still hopeful, and happy to find plenty of vegan options on the menu. I got a Stir Fried Vegetable Noodle, which was disgusting. It tasted like cheap two day old Chow Mien. The noodles were overcooked and rubbery, tasting only of soy sauce, and the vegetables were soaked in oil. My boyfriend got a beef noodle dish that was equally inedible. We shared the Vinegar Cauliflower, which had good flavors but was nothing special. I have no idea how this place is so highly rated. Perhaps my standards are too high, having had great authentic food in China and the US. However, the lack of quality and flavor in our food here leaves me to strongly suggest dining elsewhere. I give two stars only because the food was dirt cheap-\u00a318 for three large portions (which we barely touched, but still). Avoid.",

They only have a few long tables that they pile everyone on so get comfy because you'll be squashed up next to complete strangers. Getting out of the restaurant is a nightmare as well since the place to pay at is right by the tiny entrance way where loads of people are coming in and out. Basically, this restaurant is as close as you'll get to actually being in China.~ Customer Service:They were really quick and efficient. The food came out at the speed of light. Not friendly, but they get you what you need.~ Food:Terrific. Can't say enough good things about it. I recommend you skip ordering the non-noodles though, to be honest. In addition to our noodles we got a plate of steamed pork dumplings and spicy wontons. Both of those dishes were OK, but my partner and I both came out of the experience wishing we just ordered another plate of those glorious noodles instead.TIP: Order 'Dao Xiao' noodles aka knife-shaved noodles. The texture is out of this world and the springy texture from the noodle being freshly made is a perfect 10/10. I've had knife-shaved noodles a million times before but never had it as fresh as this.---If you can get over the dingy atmosphere and the fact that you're eating right next to strangers communal-style, you'll reach food nirvana like I have. Trust me - this place ROCKS!",

Experiencing the moody, unpleasant British weather was inevitable, so when a torrentuous downpour suddenly began, we ducked underneath an awning to shelter from the rain. We spotted a growing line a few doors down that piqued our interest. Although the exterior of the restaurant makes it look like a takeaway place, think of it as the middle ground between takeaway and eating in. This place is a total dive: the atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired, the service is close to nonexistent, and the cramped elbow-to-elbow communal seating probably violates the fire code.But I'd be lying if I said the handmade noodles didn't make all of that worth it. Trust me, I'm from San Francisco, a world-renowned hub for authentic Chinese food.An employee stands outside next to the line to take orders so the kitchen can start working on them before you're even seated. That way, your food will practically be ready for you once a spot frees up for you inside.

The beef was very soft, and the tendon was chewy. I would've like some more spice or flavor in the soup. They also skimped on the vegetables and only gave me a little. The noodles were not authentic knife cut noodles, but they were still good. Lanzhou is an okay noodle place, good for when you're hungry and passing through the area.",

    "text": "As a study abroad student in London for the summer, I was craving noodles and found this place close to my school! Have been here twice and ordered different dishes; both were delicious and worth the buy. Service was good too; right when you walk in the door, they'll ask you how many people are in your party and seat you right away (given that space is available). I recommend trying the knife-cut noodles, which are hand-shaven when you order. You can watch them cut your noodles. The beef noodle soup was very good--the broth was not too heavy and there is a good amount of both veggies and beef in it. Well-priced, about 7-8 pounds for a pretty big serving! Will be back again for the remainder of my stay in London! *NOTE*: Cash only if your order is under 20 pounds. I believe you can pay with card if it is under 20 pounds, but there is an added fee, so bring cash!",

I didn't have the knife noodles but this place's soup was so unimpressive even if the knife noodles were good I wouldn't go back. Lanzhou is renowned for their noodles. This place uses the name to lure you in. The inside serves a mix of different Chinese foods. You're also allowed to customize your noodles. Hint that it isn't authentic!! If I had seen the menu first, I wouldn't have gone in.My husband and I shared a bowl of beef tendon hand pulled noodles. Soup lacked depth. The chili on the side was good and the saving grace. I ended up dumping two tablespoons into my bowl. I also had two lamb skewers. It was pretty good. I almost wanted to order more. All it was missing was the good ratio of fat. Their skewers were all meat. That's not a bad thing but it's definitely better with the pieces of fat in between. The lady taking our order was so distracted by the girl next to us who wanted to change her order last minute that she failed to put down our order of roast duck and bbq pork. We had to ask someone to follow up. The guy we asked was the same one I saw watching horse races on his phone... He then proceeded to tell me they don't have roast duck so I said \u70e7\u9e2d (roast duck in chinese) and he goes oh yes ok. That's when we found out she missed our order. So we order and wait... The bbq pork was so dry I \u00a0had to spit it out. My husband was super disappointed by the food coloring. It's supposed to be red but we were disturbed how it wasn't just the outside, the red had died random spots on the inside, likely from when they were slicing. If you normally have this, it's red on the outside only... no transference of dye people... The roast duck came drenched in a sauce... I'm pretty sure they were trying to serve the duck cantonese style because it was a \u70e7\u5473 (A style of roast/bbq meat)... It was not accurate!!! Both were too sweet. Especially the bbq pork. Friendly reminder Hong Kong, located in the south of china, was a British colony. These roast meats are very common in HK. Also, Lanzhou is not in the south... I was disappointed this place was true to no region...Everyone was pretty nice except the guy who helped us at the cashier. Didn't ring me up stared at me. So I thought the number on the register was what I owed (28.10 pounds). This fool rang me up (22.50) while I was grabbing my money. So when I gave him 30 he gave me \u00a05 back and waited for me to give him change or exact instead. Really?",

    "text": "This place definitely does not live up to the hype. Maybe it's because I've had a lot of good Chinese food back in the states and in China, but this really did not satisfy my craving for Chinese.There is very little seating here, so you basically have to share a table with a bunch of strangers. It feels very tight and crowded. Not very pleasant.The actual dishes are not well prepared and feel like they came out of a Panda Express. The stir fried meat is dry, but the bok Choy we got was nice, but you can't really mess up bokchoy. The only I can really consider worth trying here are their noodles, and that's only because they handpull them. The actual noodles are quite nice. They're bouncy and have a good texture, but the broths that complement them are waaay too rich. The first few bites are great, but I couldn't even finish my bowl because of how much fat was in it.And if it was hard to take in the food, imagine what it was like to get rid of it. Let's just say, I was in the bathroom for half an hour after this.Anyways, disregarding that, I would not come back to this place, there MUST be a better Chinese place out here in London. Please fellow yelpers direct me to it.",

Walk straight in and avoid the Westernized Chinese fare that's out for takeaway in front, and ask for a table (in Chinese if you can). They'll seat you wherever they've got room (friends and I got plastic stools handed to us at one of the outside tables once...) and when you're ready, order your noodles. The classic beef noodle soup is amazing, as is the thicker cut beef stir-fry noodles. Their vegetable dishes are done well, too. One note - they only sell bottled water or soft drinks. No complementary tap here, but hey, it's cheap enough that the bottle doesn't add much onto the bill.",

He wasn't particularly rude but he was zero on the helpful scale. After getting the meal we were on our own.Seating: we were taken downstairs, a tiny table by the stairs with a stool and a chair. Apart from being uncomfortable, if you sat there you'd have people brushing by you constantly. We said we'd wait, then they found found us a better table and gave the other one to the next sucker.Food: maybe we ordered the wrong thing. Of course we got the noodles, one of each type, but I got mine 'dry' not realizing that dry meant flavourless, and that it only comes in a wide noodle. My g/f got the other noodle, fried, wide; that one tasted OK but big lumps of pasty flour tasting noodle where it obviously wasn't 'pulled' correctly, or cooked long enough. Putting enough chili oil on both made them tolerable. Mine was with duck, a tiny portion of duck. My g/f got chicken, a ton of chicken. Both meals were huge, so if you are just going for quantity you probably won't be disappointed for the price.tap water: they don't do tap water! That's right, the only restaurant we've ever been to that wouldn't give us tap water, even though they served some other people some kind of drink in a polystyrene cup so it's not like they couldn't have managed it.Most people were getting the soup, so maybe that was the better thing to order, but it doesn't matter to us because we won't be back.",

    "text": "I went on vacation with the understanding that I would probably not have any Chinese food in the foreseeable future, but I still wanted to see how expats in London did Asian cuisine.As it turns out, London's Chinatown is a 3 block long corridor of shops and restaurants. That's about it. I tried following my nose towards a good option, but nothing really popped out as a great option.Thwarted, I walked towards Leicester Square station with my head hung low. However, as I crossed the street, a certain aroma hit me. Spicy. Meaty. Something was calling me towards this small, unassuming shop with a queue full of Chinamen. An auspicious turn of events to say the least.The weather wasn't the best, but I could see that I'd have to wait a while if I wanted a seat inside. But I had no problem sitting outside in the cold. I asked the waitress what the big deal was and she told me, \"Beef noodle soup. Very good.\" How could I say no?Fortunately, she was completely on point. Hand-pulled noodles made en masse all day is the star here. Like having al dente pasta with a hearty broth ( a broth which didn't have too much MSG if any).Needless to say, I came here literally every day I was in town. Not on purpose of course. It just happened to be around when I had a craving. And at their price point, Noodle Bar was easily the most value packed meal I had on my trip. I would say that I hesitated to write this review, but since they're already so busy, it doesn't really matter what I say, does it?",

The dining area is very, very small with few tables but they are insanely busy!! You will be seated shoulder to shoulder at communal picnic styles tables and bench seats with perfect strangers which most of us aren't accustomed to. It was uncomfortable for me at first until I embraced it as an experience I'll always remember. It's loud and it's hot in there too. The second time we enjoyed Noodle Bar food, we did take away and ate in our hotel room. The food is remarkable!

But actually it's probably one of the best places to get a decent bowl of noodles in all of London, not least because they pull and slice the noodles by hand. The menu is actually quite vast but I would skip the rice dishes and just pick a noodle dish. You can't go wrong with lanzhou beef in either la mian (hand pulled) or dao xiao (knife cut.) get it with a soup and you're golden. It's like being in China. The service is FAST because the chefs never stop. Literally almost the second you order, the food will arrive. Turnover is quick but there's no pressure to eat quickly. You'll probably want to dash though because the place is small and not very relaxing. \u00a38.5 is about reasonable for central London. My previous favourite (Bao Inn \u4eba\u6c11\u516c\u793e\uff09increased their price to \u00a311.5. Needless to say... We're no longer on speaking terms. Check it out if you're nearby. Better than most places in Chinatown.",

We were in the Covent Garden Area and were looking for somewhere close and saw Lanzhou Noodle Bar through Yelp. The reviews seem pretty mixed in that some people don't recommend because of the service, but our experience was wholly positive.We were seated very quickly downstairs which was nice for us because it seemed cooler than the upstairs area. We ordered two water bottles straight ahead and sat with the menus to decide for a little bit. My mom ended up getting the fried noodles (G1 on the menu Dao Xia Mian), and my dad and I ordered the mixed beef noodle soup (G21 with Dao Xiao Mian). I wouldn't recommend the G21 if you're not good with intestines and stuff, but if you like it then I highly recommend it! We also got the pork and chive dumplings which was so great !All the food was really delicious and super filling! Could've ordered less probably since we came for lunch, but did not regret ordering! Everything was also very cheap and it's 10% off if you pay with cash! A must try if you're in the area!! Go try!! (Side note: not sure how this compares to actual Chinese hand pulled noodles because my family is Korean, but the hand pulled noodles were delicious to us! )",

If the food was better, the ambiance wouldn't bother me as much. Usually, if it's a busy, crowded establishment, I would expect stellar food but this is not the case.Why is it so crowded? Not really sure why, maybe people like this type of atmosphere or they are satisfied with the mediocrity of the food?

One star off for service / experience - we shared a table with another couple and, when I asked about the super-thin noodles (you can ask for different thin-ness of noodles), the waitress told me that the regular was just fine (which, how did she know that? I'm into super thin noodles so I felt somewhat miffed...) Luckily the noodles did turn out to be good, hence the four stars, but I'm pretty sure I would've loved the super thin ones too. Skip the other food - we also had an eggplant appetizer and curry chicken and they were both meh. Just get noodles!",

I later ordered a chicken dan dan noodle, which was not as described at all. The dan dan noodle broth was watery and plain, when the authentic version of it should be thick, rich and peanut-y. I had to add a lot of hot sauce to make it more flavourful. The noodles were the biggest disappointment as they gave me soggy rice noodles, when I was under the impression that it should've been a thicker hand-pulled noodle. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing on the menu. Overall I was disappointed.",

Service was very friendly although a quite busy place with a small in-dining area, with extra space downstairs or out front if you must. There were several people in our group, so we ordered different types of the hand-made noodles which could come \"dry\", in a sauce or as a soup. The favorite overall was the Fujian special peanut mix sauce, just the right amount of peanut flavor without being overpowering. You can add extra spice at the table if you like. Wait time was okay, because we had the hand-pulled noodles, but they also have ready made items on a buffet if need something faster. We were just in-town overnight for a film festival screening of our work, but definitely would go here again if visiting this area of the city.",

    "text": "Cheap but authentic Chinese hand pulled or knife cut noodles. I doubt you'll find a more real experience anywhere else in London.First, everyone working here is Chinese from the little lady barking seating instructions at the entrance to the cooks eating their own wares while pumping out dishes in no time.I think it was the comedian Russell Peters who joked you get your food within seconds of ordering at a Chinese restaurant. Here, the joke plays it in real life as it is comical how quickly your orders go from kitchen to table. I had one arm out of he sleeve of my coat when our entire four person order was in front of us.We had the beef noodle soup (knife cut noodles) and the stir fry char siu noodles (knife cut). We also had their spicy Chinese cabbage (which was just kimchi lol) and the potato shears dish. Had a few egg rolls for good measure but they were only ok.Everything here is quick, cheap, and is legitimately Chinese comfort food. Our parents thought it lacked quality flavor though and the broth and ingredients are definitely on the cheaper side. But where else in all of London will you find good knife cut noodles for less than 7 pounds? They accept card and your whole party must be there to be seated. Cramped tiny space so be prepared to be elbow to elbow with your neighbor. Water is an additional charge.",

As a solo diner, I was seated at a crowded table next to seven other diners. The guy next to me seemed displeased at his lack of personal space but I've spent a fair amount of time eating at food stalls in Taipei so this was nothing to me. I ordered the spicy + sour beef noodle soup with the knife cut noodles - it came out within a few minutes! (Although a party of four next to me didn't seem to have the same luck as they seemed to be waiting for a bit).The actual food: great taste value for my broke American college student self struggling to adapt to the British pound (my dish was 7 pounds but I thought it was 7 dollars while I was ordering it - still it's good value compared to most other places). The soup was savory without being too salty. I very much appreciated the spicy sauce provided at the table. The noodles were thick and fresh. The beef wasn't the best but I'm also spoiled by my mom's cooking. Service was efficient and fast (all I can ask for...and all you should really expect at these prices). Anyway, I will definitely be stopping by here on my grocery trips in Chinatown.",

These are legit hand pulled noodles and we are so happy we found this place!When you walk by it on the street, most people wouldn't even take a second look as it has all the makings of really bad Chinese. From the window you can see a steam table with a bunch of dishes. You know, the classics like fried rice, chow mien, orange chicken, etc. Don't be fooled. Walk in and you will see that there is a man making hand pulled noodles right behind the steam table, and there are a few tables for eating. Sit down, get a menu and order one of the noodle dishes! Also, if you're looking for some type of ambience, you won't find it here. This is no frills, the long communal tables in the back (yes, you might be sharing a table with strangers) are just there so you can eat your food and then get out. We're all about the noodle soups and I love both types of noodles. If you like thicker noodles, get the \"dao xiao mian\" which is knife cut noodles. If you like them thinner, go with the \"la mian\" which is hand pulled - though you can get the la mian in different thicknesses as well (skinny to fat to flat). They're all good and always perfectly al dente. They have a bunch of different noodle soups but we usually get the stewed or sliced beef. They are both our favorite. If you like it spicy, add some of the hot chili sauce on the table, so good! The only misstep we've had (and why it is 4 instead of 5 stars) is the fish noodle soup. It was incredibly bland. The noodles were good but the broth had no flavor. In our opinion, the beef options are where they shine!If you want to try some of their other dishes, we've had their mapo tofu - definitely a no. It comes with peas and carrots and isn't the slightest bit spicy. Their dumplings actually didn't fare much better as the skin was way too thick. The one standout that we have had would be the pig ear with cucumber. Totally refreshing due to the immense amount of garlic (don't eat this if you're on your way to a date, dancing, um, really anything that involves close human contact) that they mix everything in along with some vinegar. While pig ear is definitely not for everyone, I actually really enjoy it and Lanzhou makes a very good version of this classic dish!Lastly, the best part is they are open SUPER late. If you're out in Soho for the night and want something to eat other than a kebab at 2am, this is your place. I don't know about you, but this is my perfect end-of-night meal. :)",

    "text": "I located this noodle bar on Yelp, and decided to give it a shot since the reviews were a mix of average to amazing. First, as we arrived to check out the menu through the glass window--since there is not an online version we took our time reviewing (I didn't want to go in straight away because it often takes my children a long time to decide what to eat). We were stared at without a greeting by a host person for a few minutes, which didn't bother me too much, but just felt odd. Upon entering we were asked how many (again even though this person had been staring at our family for nearly 5 minutes, he asked), and then promptly seated in the back on a picnic table (next to a sink full of dirty dishes). Although Yelpers had stated the restaurant takes card, I wanted to verify, and asked the host. He stated \"only \u00a320 more. Don't have, leave, get.\" Estimating that our family would easily surpass this guideline, we stayed seated. Not a big deal, but they serve both Pepsi and Coke products (\u00a31 for a can, 20p more for Coke? Strange, but okay). Now came time to order or so we thought. The waitress was friendly, but was really pushing with regards to the menu \"noodles are specially, you order noodles,\" she took our drink orders, and walked away. I totally get it, noodles are the thing here. She returned with the drinks a few minutes later. The majority of our party went for noodles. Of note, the one dish that was not noodles, was served with steamed rice (some good parts, many parts were hard and clumped). However this dish was Kong pao chicken, and the chicken/sauce made up for the lame rice. Back to the other dishes: noodles were amazing, we had a dry chicken dish and sour/spicy chicken noodle soup. No issues with these noodle dishes at all. We also had very good crispy spring rolls! Yet, back to the issues of service. Having never been there before, we were unsure of where to pay/how to pay. I got up and asked the host, and he only pointed me to the cash register, then screamed across the restaurant at the cashier. I never received or was even able to review my bill. I attempted to follow the addition on the register (everything seemed to line up until the last items), this is where a mysterious \u00a35.20 was added to the bill. I asked, and the cashier responded \"VAT, card charge.\" Card charge didn't make sense as I was never notified of this when I asked before, but not willing to argue, and ready to go, I said nothing further. Yet, I suspect this is the main reason many people can't give the restaurant better ratings: the interactions. I want to see my bill. It was a good meal, and I'm willing to pay for it, but if you cannot explain to me why I am paying x\u00a3 for my food, I don't want to return. Sadness.",

The server kept speaking to me in Mandarin even though I kept telling him I didn't speak Mandarin and didn't understand a word he was saying. I had to point to get my order in.

    "text": "The ultimate hole in the wall. From the outside this place looks dingy, to say the least. On top of that, it is located right by Leicester Square Station and so ordinarily I wouldn't even think about entering an establishment here; most of them are tailored to tourists. And in fact, the first look at Noodle Bar confirmed my worst nightmares: brightly-coloured sweet & sour chicken in the counter and other shiny dishes that many people think if as the epitome of Chinese cuisine. However, for a while now I had followed the reviews on this place and I was especially enticed when \"Asian-food experts\" such as Yee Gan, Rob H, Katie B and Rachel Z gave this place such good ratings. By coincidence I ran into Rachel Z an hour before our visit at Noodle Bar and she was so kind to write down (in Chinese characters) the things that we should order. And that made everything so easy!When we got to the place the waiter led us downstairs and all of the sudden we were transported away from touristy Leicester Square into what could easily be a noodle bar in Hong Kong or Shanghai; not the least to judge by the fact that we were the only white folks. Having said that, don't expect anything glamorous. People come here to eat and not to socialise. They go about their business and leave. And that's exactly how the waiting staff treated us and there's as well. No kind smile, no niceties or pleasantries exchanged - only boom bang here's your food. Luckily we had the written instructions from Rachel Z (see picture uploaded) and so at least the ordering was done in a breeze. What we got was the following: one order of very garlicky marinates cucumber as a starter (delicious) and each of us then had a variation of the noodle soup: 1) had-pulled noodles with cooked beef, 2) sliced noodles with cooked beef & 3) sliced noodles with stewed beef belly. Next time I will go for the hand-pulled noodles with the stewed beef belly. All in all it was a great treat. I loved the whole experience and the food was very good as well. Will definitely be back!PS: Go easy on the chili oil that's offered as a condiment on the side. It's quite potent!",

It was too easily accessible in New York City. For about 6-7 pounds, you get a huge portion of hand pulled noodles and a topping. if you want an extra topping, it was an extra pound. (no pun intended) It was quite chilly the day I was there so this bowl of noodles was excellent.** I asked if the door could be closed because it was cold, and the lady said \"no because we are cooking\" Well then... Anyways, back to my noodles. I doused it with 2 spoons of chili (my favorite) and it was delicious! I ordered the wonton noodles with an extra topping of vegetables. Perfect combination in my opinion. My friend had the char siu with beef. She didn't think it was good, the char siu wasn't tender and was lacking flavour and the beef tasted old as if it was not eaten for a while and left sitting. You get 3 stars for the great portion size, for satisfying my chinese food craving and for having a clean bathroom (well it was clean when I went).",

Just seeing a steady flow of satiated customers going in and out every time I went for my predictable Pret nearby, was satisfaction enough.For tourists it must be a such a tough case of pot luck when picking your Peking delights if you don't know where to go or what to order when you get there. Panic not and pick a winner. You don't have to settle for lousy, if you settle down in Lanzhou. You'll be served promptly and if you have to queue when you arrive, you can order whilst you wait outside. What indeed awaits inside are big fat flat noodles that slap and splash you in the chops with hot broth as you slurp from the wide rimmed bowl bringing comfort nourishment that is utterly reviving. Man alive, these noodles are good.It's always packed with students, young families and local office workers, loud old ladies on old lady dates cackling away around you. It's a vibrant place; it has the feel of a 'caff' like-cafe but with chopsticks. There is black vinegar in ketchup bottles. They even serve green tea in Styrofoam cups to add to that effect. I normally shy away from eateries in Chinatown who's preprepared foods lay out displayed in rows of bain maries; tedious steaming trays of sweet-and-sour chicken or irk inducing oily chow mein. That's totally fine if you like the Anglicised version of things, but behind the off-putting buffet in the window is the theatre of hand pulled noodles being stretched out, thwacked and spun with pure skill. So if you're stretched for time, either at lunch or pre-show; show up here, grab a bowl of something hot fresh and delicious and be on your way. They'll be glad to have you out quickly. Have you not seen the queue forming outside?",

The noodle itself has pretty good texture (chewy and just-right).The interior / decor is mediocre at best but the store is nice and warm in the winter next to a few boiling pots where the chefs are kneading dough which then turns into strands of noodles after twisting here and there (like magic) and cooking them next to you behind the clear half-height plastic wall. I'd skipped the unpopular / small plates on the menu because they are most likely left in the fridge for far too long and tasted bland.

I ordered so much and they were delicious! I had cumin lambs on a skewer, the freshness is insane and the flavor will take you on a day dream trip to western China! Their Lanzhou noodles, however was not my favorite, but it's not their fault because Lanzhou noodles are very salty in general and I never really liked them. Make sure to order from the pictures on their wall- not their menu because the items on the wall have no English but they are much more authentic and much better bang for your buck!",

I stopped by after class with a friend and shared a sliced beef la mian, spring rolls, and fried pork and chive dumplings. The noodles were delicious as everyone else have pointed out, though I feel they skimp on the toppings. Put some of the spicy sauce in it and elevate the soup to another level! My friend loved the spring rolls and I loved the dumplings. They reminded me of home, with a thicker, homemade skin holding a juicy pork and chive filling. The reason for the low rating is for their service. The servers never had a smile on our face and all faced the door instead of at the customers inside the restaurant, making it quite difficult to catch their attention for anything. There was also one server that was picking at his ear very intently for about 5 minutes which makes me question the cleanliness of this place haha. Definitely doing takeaway next time!",

    "text": "I just moved to London and was craving some good Chinese food. Initially I was really excited to have found this place but the customer service has always been awful. I thought I could just deal with it because the food is decent but yesterday was a new low.My flatmate and I both ordered the fried pork chop noodle soup. The only difference is that she wanted the thin noodles and I wanted the thicker noodles. We also ordered pig ears with cucumber and some fried dumplings. When they brought the noodles my flatmate's order was correct but mine was wrong. Instead of a noodle soup they gave me greasy fried noodles. I wasn't upset at all, I used to work as a waitress and I totally understand that mistakes can be made. I informed the waitress that it wasn't what I had ordered. She started yelling the name of the order at me and insisted it was what I ordered. She eventually took the plate of noodles and carried it around the restaurant looking for the waitress I had ordered with. In a bit the waitress who brought my noodles and the waitress who I ordered with came to speak to me together and insisted that I had ordered the fried noodles. I told them over and over again I had ordered the fried pork chop noodle soup, not fried noodles. I'd eaten at this restaurant at least 5 times at this point and I always order the same thing so I know I didn't order incorrectly. At this point they started to yell and roll their eyes at me. When they turned around and started going up the stairs the waitress I ordered with began to talk badly about me and scream profanities in Chinese as she walked up the stairs. I don't think she realized I speak Chinese because I have a perfect American accent. At this point my flatmate and I were kind of upset that she had rudely screamed about me in another language just 2 feet away from our table. I was debating whether or not to leave or go but I really didn't want to start any drama so I decided to wait and see if she would bring me the correct order. She came back really quickly (maybe 2 minutes tops) with a bowl of noodle soup. I was so relieved when I first saw it because I thought the drama would be over. When I looked down I was really confused because the broth was extremely dark and the noodles were brown as well. I realized that what the restaurant had done was pour hot water over the fried noodles to make it into \"noodle soup.\" It was really gross. I turned to her and asked her if they had just poured hot water over the fried noodles. She looked at me and said no that's just beef broth. Beef broth is not that dark. I pointed to my flatmate's bowl (which is the same exact order as mine) and I said that her broth was clear. I also said I had eaten here many times before and I know what the soup and noodles are supposed to look like. She continued to lie to me and insisted that they had used beef broth for my soup and that's why it was a darker color. At this point I realized arguing was futile. I told her my flatmate and I were going to leave but I would still pay for her soup and the appetizer we ordered (even though we had barely touched them.) When we got to the cashier he didn't charge us for my soup but he tried to charge us for the dumplings that we never received. I didn't even really care about the money, I was just upset with the consistent lies and scheming. I told him we had never received them and asked him to take it off the bill. He eventually did after arguing with us and the total for food we barely touched was 18\u00a3. I paid that and even tipped too.The food in this restaurant is decent but the service is not. The lack of honesty and integrity in the dining staff is very disturbing. They were willing to feed me anything just to save some money and to avoid correcting their mistake.",

I had char siu and my husband had the sliced beef. Mine had a lovely flavour but was a bit fatty. The beef though was really tender and tasty.Sure, there was probably too much noodle for the amount of meat/veg, but neither of us could finish it anyway! The noodles had a nice bite and flavour. I really liked the dumplings we had on the side.I was a bit put off by the hygiene rating, but with the location in central London next to a tube station, it's not a surprise, really, that they had a rodent problem. I assume it was all sorted since they were reopened, and I didn't notice anything disgusting, or get sick, so, a win!There's no phone reception at all if you sit in the basement.",

Particularly if you are out on a cold winters day and looking for something filling. There are good side dishes too if you are interested.

You're welcome to come and eat what you like and they will offer little guidance. You'll have to deal with it and enjoy the crap out of the food. Ps My spring roll looked boring and average but how the heck was it so great? Fresh out of the fryer...that's howPps make sure you try some of the spicy sauce with the fried garlicPpps when you think you're too full...drizzle some of the black vinegar (you'll think it's soy sauce but it's not) onto whatever you're eating. \u00a0That should cut the fat just enough and if you like vinegar like me, it just takes you to another world of flavors.",

Why is this place not in Chinatown? I assumed it was in chinatown but apparently not. Okay so the front of the restaurant are for those uneducated americans who like americanized chinese food or those that actually know its americanized chinese food and still like it. Then in the back is the authentic where the noodles are made. They were pretty good, good enough where i ate them twice while i was in london. It was cheap, cash only i think (if i remember correctly) ....but they can't compare to the price and noodles you can get in taiwan. But still pretty darn good. My one problem is i hate sharing tables, and here, you have to share tables -_- ugh, i know its traditional chinese style but no, just no lol. Oh, and the staff do speak english and mandarin. Overall, if your chinese, go for the taiwanese noodle, they are def worth getting. Not quite as cheap or as flavorful as in taiwan, but still pretty darn good. I def will be back.",

For starters, it would be quite easy to mistake this place for your average cheap Chinese takeout place, order some pre-prepared sesame chicken and be on your way. Do not let the giant piles of pre-made greasy late-night food, distract you. YOU ARE HERE FOR THE NOODLES. I would highly recommend the stewed beef noodle soup. Or, the stewed beef noodles in any way it is offered. They are so expert and perfectly prepared, my mouth is watering thinking about them. Be warned, this place is intense. It is perma-crowded and filled with locals and tourists alike. Be prepared to elbow your way in and push to be seated and allowed to stay in your seat. My friend was here a few weeks ago and didn't eat as quickly as her companions. They were asked to sit outside while waiting for my friend to finish. They, of course, refused and everything was fine, but this place is not for the meek.If you know what to order and aren't intimidated by the giant crowd and unfriendly waitstaff, this is the place for cheap and authentic DELICIOUS noodles.",
