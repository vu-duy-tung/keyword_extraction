He staff and head of staff are totally or of their depth. Antagonistic. Awkward. Bad service. Not acceptable. I won't do back. Our friends won't go back. There are so many other delicious good and decent staffed places down the road - any of these is a better choice.",

The main bar is a huge open area with a wrap around bar, with plenty of seats and tables around the room. Love the wood furnishing and dimly lit atmosphere!Drinks/food wise it's great - Blues Kitchen actually does a pretty damn good jerk chicken and would highly recommend it! It's a good value menu for both drinks and food, and despite this being a busy venue, it's at the top of my venues in Shoreditch!",

    "text": "This is a very deceiving place I found! The menus online, and the website itself, and even the decor of the building and venue, imply that you're going to get some good food... But really, you're not! Maybe I just didn't pick well on the menu, but even the things I shared with my friends weren't up to scratch. I had the Blackened Chicken & Ranch salad. I expect a salad for \u00a39.90 to have some dazzle, and some depth to it, but sadly, this salad did not. The weirdest thing about it was that I tasted no ranch in it at all. The delicious creamy and tangy flavour I was expecting to be there, was never there! I was very disappointed that the \"hard boiled eggs\" were in fact little bits of crumbled boiled eggs, when I was expecting to have some warmly sliced freshly hard boiled eggs, and also the crispy bacon was not freshly friend bacon, but small little tiny bits of cold dry bacon. The thing that still gets me is the \"buttermlik ranch dressing\" that simply did not exist! It tasted so heavily of dill that I didn't really understand what I'd been served.After confusingly telling the waitress that there was no boiled eggs, (which I thought at first), she apologetically took my plate away. Whilst I was waiting for my dinner, a waiter came over to me and asked which one of the table was disappointed with our meal, and he would offer them a drink on the house. This was nice, but I still don't think it made up for what had happened, and what would later happen! After I'd got my free beer (yay!), the waitress brought over my new plate. She said that there was boiled egg on it, but that it was the small crumbly bits of egg. She had got the chef to just add more of this to my plate... Very disappointing and not what I want from a \u00a39.90 salad!I did also order sweet potato fries that were \u00a34, and this portion size was pathetic! It was enough for a baby's breakfast.Don't recommend eating here at all, but the live band is fun, they start at 10pm :)",

    "text": "I think I've fallen in love!A wonderful, enchanting, authentic feeling venue, that is simply delightful and a great place to relax with friends and let all those stresses out.A friend suggested me try out rib Monday at the blues kitchen and I was blown away.We arrived to be greeted by a 30 minute wait, but opted instead to sit at the bar. With comfy bar stools, close proximity to the informative and friendly bar staff, who are happy to chat, I can't see why people would want to sit at tables if they were in a party of two. I think we found the best seats in her house.The decor is just stunning. I know this is a new venue, but they have period features, fantastic tile work, aged ceiling tiles, sturdy deluxe seating and tables and a fantastic acoustic resonance.I particularly liked the customised old gramophone lighting greeting you at the door, it reminded me of monarch in San Francisco, which has the most amazing converted trumpet light fixtures, and this as well as a number of other quite obvious American style features, was reminiscent of that great Californian city. Exactly what you're looking for in an American style bar!And the food! \u00a0\u00a310 for the best beef and pork ribs I've had in a long time. The beef melted off of the bone, quite literally and the pork was finger licking good.I had intended to try some sides, but seeing the portion sizes, opted just for the ribs, and even then I had to take half home. They even had the same boxes that you get for take-away over their. A cute, but probably coincidental touch.I might have to go back just to try their mac and cheese and see if it's up to scratch.Fantastic cocktails too, I would recommend the Hemingway daiquiri. The bartenders talked us through how it was made, as well as mother cocktails, and made a very good wine recommendation - although with only five reds to choose from, it's not that hard.At around 9pm a live jazz band also started in the back, although with the way the venue is set up with a central bar, it wasn't hard to hear throughout the venue.I'm already planning my trip back - although with a 30 minute wait on a Monday, I'm not sure I would come back on a weekend unless we'd booked.",

    "text": "Recently I have discovered that where I work and play are more often than not filled with hidden treasures. You get so wrapped up in the normal and regular, that you often pass great places, and not even know it.Blues Kitchen in Hoxton is one such place. I work in Shoreditch and live in Hoxton, so there is no shortage of places for me to go. In fact, there are key places which I frequent because i know and like them. A friend had mentioned Blues Kitchen before and I had no idea where it was. Then, one Tuesday evening we were wandering around and had originally chosen Barrio East as a location. Due to it being Christmas, there was an exclusive hire so our plans had to change. I googled the area and Blues Kitchen popped up. What first hits you about Blues Kitchen is its size. It is quite deceiving from the outside. As you go in and work your way around the central bar, you not only pass a lot of drinking space, there is also a stage and some kind of caravan type private room in the back. Then there is the restaurant on the right hand side, slightly raised so you can people spot in the bar.Let's start with the bar first. It is busy. A lot of men in fact. So, it could be good for seeking out Mr Right (or Wrong). I myself, was not in the market for such activity as hunger was clouding my desire to flirt. The lively and lovely hostesses at the front desk advised us that there would be a 45 minute wait as we didn't have a reservation. We headed to the bar for some drinks to wait and before we downed our first round, we were approached by menfolk. So yes, I can safely say you can pick up here.We were saved by the bell, when our hostess came to find us (they normally call your mobile, but we had such good banter at the door, how could they forget us :). We were seated at a booth and passed onto to an equally lovely waitress. Is it possible for so many cool folk to work in the same place? I don't know if we hit them on a good day, but from the door, to the bar, to the restaurant, it was all smiles (genuine not fake).They have a solid meaty menu and it was a task ordering from the selection as we wanted everything. For our starters Ky ordered what looked like buns packed full with crab meat. For my starter I had pimento padron, as I did not want to fill my belly too much. Andie had spicy chicken wings. For main I had tender smoked chicken legs and thighs (smoked for two hours) with a side of friends and slaw. Ky had buttermilk marinated crispy fried chicken with fries and sauce. Andie had a burger filled with a patty of ground beef brisket with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle. mayo and mustard. All the food was big on portion size, tasted like heaven on the tongue and definitely hit the spot. It's all grilled and bbq'd to perfection. It is impossible to fault our dining experience. Everything was on point from the welcome (even Security were nice), to drinks at the bar and then the awesome food. This will be added to, if not replacing some of my favourite options for drinks and dinner in the Hoxton area. Unfortunately either we did not stay late enough or there wasn't music on the night we visited but for future reference, they do have a live band. Hit up the website to see when they play. I recommend you book for the restaurant and if you have a celebration, reserve one of the booths or tables. This is a great place to party or watch others have fun.",

The venue looks like a lot more care has been put into the decor and it is very East London with tiles and exposed brick.There is a great selection of beers including bottles of Innis & Gunn and if they could expand the range to cover the rum aged version I'll become a regular! The food menu is fairly standard although they do sometimes run specials which are well worth keeping an eye out for. There's currently a burger that looks incredible.During the week there's various music themes going on. I was there on a Tuesday for what sounded like jazz but I'm definitely heading back on a Sunday to check out the gospel night. Should be great fun. Let me know if you want to join me!",

They made sure we were all looked after and our food was on point. I had the Beef Brisket and Pulled Pork Platter with Sweet potato fries.

Not a lot of bang for your buck but that was mainly down to what we ordered.Buffalo wings were tasty but not life changing.We ordered the seafood platter to share, which we were told was 'hearty'. I expected deep fried elements like Southern cooking but it was an impressive looking fruits de la mer platter. For the \u00a331 between two there just wasn't enough meat, but the sauces were SUPERB.Most importantly - ORDER THE OREO DOUGHNUTS. Holy cow this thing is made of dreams and you will cry at night wishing for more. Cocktails are on the expensive side but then so is all of London plus the beer is nearly \u00a35 a pop which is a bit of a killer. Just be wise with your order and all will be awesome.",

We only stopped for a quick drink so I cannot comment on the food though what passed under our noses as we waited looked delicious. Think American classics with a (very welcome) east London twist. Our drinks were both rum based cocktails and though the presentation would score a 10/10 the contents we all slightly off balance. Very limey/acidic. However this said the standard was there and perhaps we just caught a sour staff member. I will just have to go back to trail another few!",

Being a Friday night, it was of course rammed - come on, this is Shoreditch and this is London after all - but we had a reservation. However it was even a struggle to have a drink at the bar before our table was ready because it was so busy in there, and I mean busy as in people really pushing and shoving you to the point of rudeness.I'd ordered a Malbec and was quite shocked when they said that wasn't available, even though it was clearly stated in the menu, so I ordered a Rioja instead. For food I ordered the Mac and Cheese with bacon and it was really nice and a really big portion which I was unable to finish. We then shared a huge slice of Banofee Pie for dessert which was really nice. The atmosphere was very busy and lively and they play live music too which one of our waiters invited/recommended us to join but we had to leave. Prices were typical London I'd say and you won't be disappointed with what you get and it's in the heart of Shoreditch if you want to go to other bars before or after.",

Almost no flavour or any garnishes like bacon or leek. Not to be expected, I know. But it would have been a nice surprise.The milkshakes here are gigantic and worthy of constituting a meal in themselves. When it comes to the food however, my chicken burger and fries arrived cold, and despite it being a brioche bun it was awful and commited the key sin of burger breads. The bread was stale crumbly. No no no.In all, the staff were pleasant enough and the venue decor as well as presentation of dishes was spot on. However the key is ALWAYS the food. And despite getting everything else right, I am entirely disappointed and much more upon recollection than I was at the moment of time I was there.What was gutting is that Hache was just next door and looks really nice if the pictures from their site are to be believed. I won't be back here again but hopefully they fix the food for future customers.",

The booths were fitting with the theme of the restaurant, and it meant our table of 3 felt quite private. Staff were very attentive, maybe too attentive as as soon as I sat down I was asked if I wanted a drink - hadn't even picked up the menu! We also had several people come over and ask the same questions. But I think it was probably down to opening week nerves and wanting to be attentive. Not too much of a problem, as they were really friendly. Menu is very typical American bar food. All three of us had a Jerk Chicken Burger with fries and slaw, but two swapped the fries for sweet potato fries. All nice enough bar food, nothing stand out with it though. The deserts on the other hand! Their special sundae was really great! Salted caramel ice-cream with cookies, marshmallows, grapes and all sorts in there. It looks quite special too, but definitely enough to share! The drinks menu is good, lots to choose from. We all went for a gin based 'Wibble' with sloe gin, gin, Chambord and grapefruit. YUMMY! Would love to see what it's like for a night out and some drinks, definitely will venture there one weekend.",

I was really stoked to see spinach and artichoke dip on the menu--but they had put it in a blender and it was like soup. \u00a0The old fashioned my friend had was chock full of ice. \u00a0The brisket was too thick and the sauce was too sweet.And despite it being the Blues Kitchen it felt more like a big lindy hop fest.It is a massive space and the decor is trying so hard to be authentic it hurts. \u00a0I felt the restaurant was lost and so was I....Burger was good, but better to go to the burger experts.",

I came here at the beginning of my trip in Europe at the advice of the pocket travel book we had and I'm so glad we made the trek across the city to get here! When we walked it, we were shocked at how CROWDED the enormous room was, it seemed like everyone had the same idea we did. After squeezing our way to a spot at the bar, we were able to get our drink orders in and listen to the wonderful live band that was entertaining the crowd - birthday parties and friends galore!The bartenders were so friendly and made us feel right at home there - the highlight of our experience at the Blues Kitchen (other than the amazing jazz band of course).The only thing was there just wasn't anywhere for us to sit or stand when we got our drinks. Everywhere we stood we were asked by servers to move, or given dirty looks for getting in the bubbles of other people. Hello! We are trying to relax and enjoy the music too - not like we WANT to be in everyone's way either :(Overall a learning experience - next time if we want a spot at the bar or a table come earlier I suppose!",

We bought tickets for the Amy Winehouse tribute show that night, and arrived about an hour and a half early to get good seats, eat, have some drinks, and take in the atmosphere. The place was packed for the Brazil/Belgium game, but we managed to get good up-front seating in the stage area. The food was excellent, as were the cocktails, and bar service was very speedy. The problem came when staff came to prep the stage for the concert we came to see. We were informed less than 15 min before the show was to start that we needed to give up our table so they could create a \"dance floor\" space. We were told we could sit or stand in the back. Uh... what? We just spent upwards of 100 pounds on food and liquor (plus more for the tickets), PURPOSELY got there early to get good seats, and you are telling us this now? I'm sorry, but regardless of city regulations, that's just unacceptable. The manager was completely unapologetic about it. We got a refund on the concert tickets and left. I'd be more understanding if we hadn't traveled from the US on vacation, and essentially wasted one of our nights here.",

I had to make a trip after seeing their burger of the month on their Facebook page: a beef patty with caramelized onions, bacon, and b\u00e9chamel, all sandwiched between two friggin grilled cheese sandwiches!!! Holy Cheezus! How could I say no?The burger was a 5 out of 5, though not because of the grilled cheese bun. The quality came from the beef, bacon, and onion combo. Top ingredients all around. The grilled cheese was an afterthought. It felt a bit like a stuffed-crust pizza where the cheese was simply relocated to inside the bun instead of on the meat. It still worked its magic there, but really I'm excited for all of their burgers now since they'll all share that same amazing beef patty! And I'll dream of those onions for weeks...The service was fine, some bartenders friendlier than others. The place was super popular on a Sunday night and would've had to wait 2.5 hours until a table opened up (8:30), so had a drink at the bar and waited for a barstool to open up to order food. Great ambiance and a live gospel choir Sunday nights. Can't wait to try their Monday rib special.",

    "text": "Came here for brunch the other day with a few friends. We tried booking however bookatable said there were no tables available to book. I wasn't hopeful we would get in but had a few back ups. When we actually turned up at 11.30 it was empty and there were tonnes of tables available. I thought perhaps they don't take bookings for smaller groups but they definitely do - maybe it's a Sunday brunch thing? Might be advisable to call? The place itself is massive with a great central bar and lots of booths around it. There is also a stage in the corner and some further seating in a camper van!!! Dying to sit in that! Think there is also private areas for booking downstairs. Service was quiiiite slow especially because of how few people were there however nice and chilled for a Sunday and our waitress was really friendly. The brunch menu is awesome and very varied from pigs and biscuits, pancakes, chicken & waffles and English breakfast. I went for the American breakfast - bbq beans, toast, tomato, potato hash, egg, bacon and a side of pancakes and maple syrup. All for \u00a38.50 - there was so so much food. I ended up giving the bacon, egg and potato away and kept my fav bits. The bbq beans are delish and the fluffy pancakes and maple syrup were also good. All washed down with a coffee. My bf went for the pigs and biscuits which he thoroughly enjoyed (scones and pulled pork) and I tried a bit of and liked too! A friend went for the chicken and waffle. This was \u00a312.50 so more pricey than the rest of the other meals but it was massive!!! The waffle was okkkk but not my fav however the fried chicken was crisp on the outside and succulent on in the inside. Quite impressed however over all the dish was a little dry and got a bit samey. Half way through a guy started singing and playing the piano which really added to the atmosphere.Overall a great place, great food, reasonably priced with lovely staff. I'm looking forward to coming here for dinner!",

We get there 5 minutes early and they didn't have our table so we were pointed at a space at the bar to wait. Then we were told to move from there to another spot. And from that spot we were moved again, but promised that was the last move. Until the next one about 40 seconds later. The food was good, but service was slow. A Margarita took 25 minutes to arrive. A milkshake arrived what must be a record 35 minutes after being ordered. Despite their inability to bring us anything that we ordered in a reasonable amount of time, we were still kicked out bang on the 2 hour mark. No dessert. No after meal drinks. And not for want of trying, just because they couldn't deliver against the load of customers they had. I've gone from recommending this place to anyone who'll listen, to writing this review. Like I say, the food was good. If you're prepared to be treated like cattle in order to eat cattle, go for it. Otherwise go elsewhere.",

We stumbled upon this place while walking around shoreditch and what a great find! Great food, friendly, efficient service and a man playing the piano whole we are. The brunch menu has plenty of choices, all southern inspired - chicken and waffles, pig and biscuits, crab benedict.. Everything sounds great, after much deliberations, I went for the healthy breakfast, avocado, halloumi, poached egg - basically all my breakfast favourites together. Total no brainer and absolutely delicious! My friend opted for the pig and biscuits and couldn't stop raving about how good it was!Price wise, when the bill came they had made a few add ons, a charity donation and a service charge, but it still came in at the not too shabby price of 20 pounds for the two of us! Win win! I hear this place is good for a cocktail and for dancing to blues late into the night, so I'm keen to come back on a Friday night to dance the night away!",

    "text": "Oh. My. Goodness. This is some of the best barbecue I've had in years, and easily the best I've had in London.First, I recommend getting a reservation. Even on a Monday night, this place was busy and with a reservation there's a two hour 'limit' to most tables, without a reservation it's probably very difficult to get seated if you're more than a party of 2.The venue was somewhere between a small blues bar in the West Village mixed with an old-school cocktail lounge. The booths, though advertised for 6, can fit 8 if you're happy to get cozy.We started off with wings, which were fantastic! Meaty, perfectly cooked, and the sauce was perfect. I didn't even try the blue cheese dressing because the wings were so good. Not enough carrots on the side, but we survived without. We also had grilled peppers which were exactly as expected - if you like grilled peppers, these are grilled peppers. Tasty, but nothing exciting.For the main, our table had several orders of ribs, some brisket, slaw, and crisps. These ribs will bring me back to The Blues Kitchen many times I am sure. The meat fell off the bone with ease, and was absolutely delicious. There were several sauces at the table, I personally found the mustard barbecue sauce to be the best - a perfect companion to both the beef and pork ribs. I'm told the brisket was also good but I was too busy stuffing myself on ribs.The drink menu was great as well, I was pleasantly surprised to find Flying Dog beer which was a great companion to the meat meat meat meat meat. Several of my friends had mojitos, which were good but a bit overly sweet.All in all, there's no doubt that I'll be returning to The Blues Kitchen for my barbecue fix in London.",

Pick your own table, grab a drink and chat as long as you like. Cozy environment. Lovely music. There is a stage in the right hand side corner of the restaurant. Not sure when live music stars. The last time I was there I left too early to see any live performances. While sitting there sipping my drink I was served some hot spicy chicken wings with a distinct lemony flavor and a hint of heat. Left my lips burning. But good kind of burning. It almost felt like, the bourbon I was having, had just found its true love. I'll definitely go there again. Not too far away from where I work. Will keep you posted with updates.

    "text": "Thanks to the music and service, they maintain their 4 stars.Onto the food and drink...We booked dinner here to sample the Southern cuisine. Now, I'm not Southern but I do know my BBQ and I damn sure know mac 'n cheese USA style.So, the easy bits - the drinks were all on point and there is no fault in the bourbons and whiskey's in here. Drink up!We started with the artichoke dip w/nachos. Yeah, my U.S. peeps you heard: With Nachos, not the bloomed artichoke. Oh and the dip was actually pea soup. YES! Pea Soup. Must have had Houdini in the back or something. We sent it back.The alligator and burgers(chicken, veggie and The Elvis Presley) got top marks from my mates; I went for the chili mac 'n cheese as I had to, I just had to see if it was going to be done in a southern or even just the American style that they say it is. It is not! I have been to many a place in London to have mac 'n cheese and this is just another FAIL. Overcooked pasta, not even salt and pepper to season, never mind the cheese which was not ooey or gooey - it was a sauce. WTF?The chili was okay, just okay. There was no kick to it. The meat was cooked really well and not a trace of fat to be found - winner - but the flavour was no where near Tex-Mex, Mex or anything remotely south of the border. I had to add hot sauce, which also was not hot. What a shame :(The mac 'n cheese. Let me just say this. I am done trying to find mac 'n cheese in the UK. I will consign it all to trial and error - numerous trials and errors. A real flippin' shame :(The service here was excellent though. No people hovering inappropriately as you bite into your food. Always a smile and they also didn't seem rushed despite the fact that it was quite busy in there. I like that kind of control.Hmm, I wonder if I should give the brunch a try?",
