I traced the map in my head and nothing jumped out at me screaming, \"good coffee here!\" until I remembered Sunday. I had walked past the new restaurant a couple weeks prior and admired the typography on a hanging paper cup that was advertising its arrival in the neighborhood. When I went in, it was all smiles and easy banter that would have convinced me to stay and tuck into one of the beautiful breakfasts they were serving if I hadn't been pressed for time. As I waited for my iced Americano, I asked whether Sunday had free wi-fi, picturing myself \"working from home\" there while basking in an atmosphere much livelier than the one surrounding my small basement desk. And the answer was yes!I can't comment on the food because I didn't indulge in any, but it all looked divine - especially the lemon drizzle cake that took all of my willpower to resist. However, Sunday just received a stunning review in The Independent, so it seems everything tastes as good as it looks.",

Seating area is small inside but nobody really seems bothered as everyone is too busy enjoying the delicious food. The menu has great variation so there's something for everyone, and portions are generous. Have also been here twice for dinner, high quality food with superb taste and elegantly presented.

    "text": "If you ever visit Paris one thing that city does really well at the moment, food-wise, is the weekend brunch experience. It really does put London to shame, in my opinion at least. While sitting at Sunday's, on an actual Sunday I had that same feeling I get in Paris, so am i fan for the atmosphere and cuisine but the problem I have, as I do in Paris, is that this comes at an inflated cost. I am a little autistic, i work in maths, so when I go to an eatery I tend to tot up the numbers in my head for the relative cost of a meal v potential operating costs to work out the value for money. With Sundays the sums just don't add up. The restaurant is situated on Hemingford Road which, as quant as it is, isn't a central location and therefore shouldn't and won't have the same rental costs as restaurants in Hoxton or Upper St, Islington. So why, I ask myself, are the costs for breakfast as expensive, if not actually more pricey than in those locations? I guess its a lack of competition and an inflating of prices due to affluent catchment area with very little competition. If we look at the floor space p/m2 it isn't that huge of a restaurant either. Assessing the food and service, yes both were very good and I applaud the chef for his thoughtful menu. I like going to this brunch place, as its the only decent one within a ten minute walk of my girlfriends house but i hate the feeling I'm being hit in the pocket every time i show up. Maybe they pay their staff very well, maybe they use more sustainable produce than other places. I like it here a lot but its overpriced a lot too.",

    "text": "*No Reservations. Small and cute place for brunch/lunch/coffee/whatever you feel like that requires good food and coffee. I ordered the corn fritters and kiln smoked salmon. It was a good dish. Well put together. I liked how the corn fritters were not at all fried. They were light and went well with the salmon. However, they were a tad bit on the dry side. My friend didn't want his egg from his smoked chicken dish, so with the egg, it was a good portion. Without the egg, I would probably have still been hungry. So my advice is to order a side of eggs with this dish. We also ordered the Green chilli cornbread dish and this was so so. The beans salsa was pretty much just black beans and diced tomatoes. There was no flavor combustion that you usually get from salsa. I think they need to go back and experiment with the \"salsa\". But for a small local spot like this, the kitchen seems to put a lot of care into the food and I do notice that. Overall great place to have brunch or lunch. Staff is nice and place is cozy.",

This particular visit was tinged with seeing my friend off before emigration but what a way to go, we had a very nice blackbean, pork belly and chorizo stew with a topping of corn bread and a poached egg. A really beautiful meal of the level of the former Assiette Anglais on the nearby Liverpool Road.

    "text": "I live right around the corner from here and have had it recommended by many Islington locals, but it wasn't until I had a early weekend morning with no prior brunch reservations that we decided to give it a try (as they don't take reservations). I looked up the opening hours and figured that arriving around 10 AM was ok, but we arrived at 10:05 AM and unfortunately the entire restaurant was already full, as it is clear that people queue up before the doors open. The restaurant is pretty small and there are only about 25-30 seats inside, so I would not recommend coming with a group larger than 4 people.Luckily it was not raining so we sat at one of the tables outside and were able to order coffee while we waited for a table to free up. About 45 minutes later, the first round of brunchers were finishing up and we were seated at one of the tables close to the kitchen. I got the huevos rotos, which was chorizo, peppers, and some other veggies and scrambled egg and served on top of bread with avocado. Two of my friends got the corn fritters served with kiln smoked salmon, which is not your typical raw-ish slices of smoked salmon but rather a large piece that seems more cooked with a smoky flavor. The last one got the Welsh rarebit with smoked haddock, which was also a more cooked version of smoked fish.Overall the food was good and service was quick, but I do find the no reservations policy a bit annoying and I would have definitely been irritated if we waited any longer. There was a large queue of about 15 people by the time we left, and most order takeaway coffee to drink while they wait, as most don't even get the luxury of waiting at an outdoor table. The staff was pretty stressed about the situation and the close quarters are not exactly comfortable. But everyone seemed to be a local and it continues to be very popular, so do come early or be prepared for considerable time in the queue!",

I ordered the salmon salad and only word for it is perfection! Very tasty, big portion, healthy and nice heat from the chilli sauce on top. And the dish looked beautiful too.

    "text": "I seriously don't get the massive appeal of this place. Granted the food is lovely and the owner is lovely but there is just something about the place that I don't get. Perhaps it is its massive popularity. People seem to travel from far and wide at the weekends, and queue up outside for ages to get into a very small, cramped and noisy coffee shop. There is not even enough room to squeeze in between tables placed next to each other, and god love you if you are left to sit on the horrible stools at the window or the two seater table by the counter. The place is soooo cramped it is uncomfortable. And I hate eating somewhere that people are queuing up outside waiting to come in I just feel rushed. I have even seen the owner turn to an old man (who seemed to be a regular), that was in no rush to leave and ask him to move to a smaller table so she could get more people in. He did exactly what I would of done which was leave!!During the week it seems to be made up of a local business crowd sitting there for hours doing business on their mac books, or having business meetings. It does have a little more of a chilled vibe.On my last visit my sister wanted just a toasted sandwhich and even though it is something the do with rarebit, they couldn't alter the dish to just cheese on toast!! But were quiet willing for her to get pancakes without bacon, but still charge for it. As I said the quality of food is lovely, but the cramped, loud and rushed feel of the place makes this place very unappealing even though its right on my doorstep.",

We only had a five minute wait at noon, before we were seated at a small table near the counter where they display the cakes. Our server was very friendly and chatty. I was boring and ordered the avocado toast, which was surprisingly good with seasoning that set it apart from the hundreds of others available throughout Islington. My friend ordered a squid salad that she raved about for days. The menu rotates seasonally and is available on their Facebook page, but later in the day, some of the more popular dishes are often sold out.The coffees and cakes are a great way to prolong your brunch and avoid the rain. I highly recommend the toasted banana bread.",

The menu is small and the food takes a while to come out, probably 30 minutes, but thats because each dish is intricately crafted and freshly made. We ordered curried eggs with scallion pancakes and sweet potato pancakes.The flavor combinations were unexpected but they worked together perfectly. These people have brunch down to a science.

The pancake stack with honey comb butter was melt in your mouth delicious. Do yourself a favor and order the corn fritters on the side, they were da bomb. The avocado with them was incredibly fresh.

Got there at around 11.30am on a Saturday and there was already a line about 10 people long!!! Luckily it went by rather fast and the restaurant is actually bigger than it seems. They definitely need more waitstaff as the wait for getting served omce you're seated plus waiting for your food CAN be a long one. The iced tea is really refreshing and not too strong on the Earl Grey side, which I was really pleased about. It just tastes like a proper lemonade but with a kind of muted fruit taste...? Not sure if that makes sense, but you can taste the tea but it is not overpowering.I knew I wanted something with eggs but I was so very tempted by the french toast and pancakes... I could see them being served to others and they looked AMAZING. Ended up getting Huevos Rancheros with a side of corn fritters. SO FILLING. BIG MISTAKE. It was really tasty so it was worth it, WHATEVER IT'S BRUNCH. Only downside was the avocados were not too ripe so they were really hard and so not that tasty and the corn chips at the bottom on the bowl got super soggy super fast which was Sad. The corn fritters are sooo tasty as well!!! Also filling. They came with sour cream and some kind of a chutney or jam thing that I honestly didn't touch. Almost a 5 star rating but only because there was so much waiting involved and they left the chorizo in my eggs even though I asked for it to be removed. :( DEFINITELY COMING BACK FOR SWEETS THOUGH.",

We were told it would probably be 30-40 minutes... and I hadn't seen my friends for yeeears so we got ready for a good chat to pass the time. After an hour, we still had not been seated, but by then we'd invested so much time that we just kept waiting. The menu looks really good, and we could see other people's brunches so we just wanted to try EVERYTHING. Alas...in the end it took 2 hours before we got seats(!!!) I really did enjoy my corn fritters with salmon, and everything my friends and I ordered looked amazing, and tasted even better. So the food is really delicious.

It blew my mind in all the typically London-esque ways.Mindblown element 1: \"Heeey, let's grab some brunch on a THREE P.M. on a Sunday (does that even count as brunch anymore?!) and STILL wait for 45 minutes to get a seat in this cafe (which btw seems to be located in bumfrick nowhere as far as Angel goes - how does everyone know its secret?! Oh I gettit - that's why we have Yelp!). ** Cries bitter tears **Mindblown element 2, 45 mins later: \"Omnonomnomnom these are the best eggs ever what is happening in my mouth, I totally get it - this is why London is London.\"Honestly, I can't believe I'm saying it, but great effing food worth the wait. My eggs had the nicest pistachio relish ever which just went fabulously with the avocado and the very well flavoured salad. All the rich flavours and the egg yolks mixing and soaking into my fluffy bread = epicness of epic proportions.The service is really nice - we were quite intrigued with a couple of items on the menu and the gentleman serving us very helpfully walked us through everything. Water for the table is complimentary (which is useful, because for my taste, and that's the only bummer here, the drinks are a wee on a small side. I could use a proper big mug of chai / coffee with such a heavy brunch). The atmosphere is really chill and perfect for a Sunday - even with a full capacity, the place somehow manages to give off a relaxed and relatively intimate vibe. Unfortunately we tried it on a rainy day, but someday I'd like to sit in the little courtyard area behind - it looked cozy.So yes, do definitely come here for a big treat brunch, but get your small talk ready for some serious lazy wait - I sincerely hope that I made somebody's next Saturday's line another 5% longer with this review by convincing y'all to try this place.",

    "text": "This small hipster joint has been on my brunch list for a while. First impressions: slightly rustic vibe, damn that queue and I want to get my hands on everything on that menu. My brunch partner and I went the sweet route and got the pancakes, brioche French toast and toasted banana bread. I love that they also do half portions of both their pancakes and French toast which means you can try both these dishes without bursting the seams of your trousers. The banana bread was YUM, especially the delicious cinnamon butter it was served with. French toast, on the other hand, didn't quite blow my mind. The caramel sauce tended to dominate too much. Decent effort regardless. Service was alright, although smiles were in short supply. Be prepared for a long queue after 10am on the weekend and for cramped seating space (which just means constant food envy!) but for me, I am already planning a second visit.",

    "text": "Wow... So best brunch in London? I can't say I've tried them all, but you'd be struggling to find anything much better. If you're lucky enough to have the time, then stop by here on a weekday to avoid 30-60 minute weekend queues. The food here is outstanding. The first time I came it was for lunch because I was staying nearby and wanting something a bit healthier than a chippy or kebab shop. I waited 10 minutes or so and was seated by on the bar by the window. It's a tight space. But I was easily able to enjoy my scrambled eggs on toasted sourdough... I mean, this really sounds underwhelming, but it's some of the best scrambled eggs and toast I've had in ages! I decided to go for the kiln smoked salmon on the side, but considering I live in Scotland this wasn't out of the ordinary for brunch for me and wasn't quite worth the extra 3.50... But if you're not from somewhere it's readily available, then it was a tasty addition. On my second visit, the wife and I waited about 30 minutes and then were able to get a table outside. I got the courgette fritters... Wow! These were amazing. They were topped with Parmesan, on top of avocado and halloumi with a stunning poached egg in the middle on a base of yogurt. This is seriously one of the best brunches I've ever had. While we were sitting at our table you could hear multiple customers talking about their brunch plates and the items they ordered... This is a rare occasion at any restaurant... At least in a positive sense like this.",

But you can revel in the fact that you will be having a quality brunch feast once you're finally seated.The rotating menu, which is comprised of an even mix of always on the menu classics and seasonally inspired items, is up on their Facebook page. Don't study it too hard beforehand or your heart will get broken. Or get there early (i.e., when they open at 10am) to guarantee that they don't sell out of what you want.First time I'd seen my fave brunch entree of shrimp & grits on a London menu so I had to have it. I got the last order of the grilled tiger prawns, soft corn grits, chorizo, chili fried eggs entree, which made my day. Don't want to think about the distress and misery I caused the next person who attempted to order it. Food came out relatively quickly (15 min or so). Both my brunch date and I marveled at the colorful presentation of my plate (the placement of those tender and sweet corn kernels though!). The flavors melded well together - succulent sweet shrimp, spicy chorizo, creamy grits, fresh avocado slices.The wait staff were friendly and let us linger despite the steady stream of customers waiting on line. They were prompt in bringing us the check when we asked for it and asked several times if everything was satisfactory. The table next to ours ordered the berry pancakes, which looked ridiculously amazing and they kept oohing and aahing over them - that's what I'll be having the next time I'm here!",

Waited for about 15 minutes and had a table.Once inside, it took about 15 minutes for someone to take our order. Water with fresh mint was in the table. Ordered coffee first, and the cappuccino was wonderful! The food took a while, but it was worth it. Had the buttermilk pancakes, bacon, syrup and butter with a side of corn fritters for lunch. Huge portion size! The pancakes were moist and fluffy and all-around perfect. Perfectly cooked, high-quality bacon was latticed on top with a generous helping of maple syrup. The only downside was the fruit on the plate; while it added to the presentation, it had been soaked in some sort of sugary syrup BEFORE being placed on the plate. Sugar overload! If it were fresh, it would have added something really lovely to the taste.The atmosphere is cozy and warm. The place is quite small and elbow room is in short supply, but the flavors of the extensive menu make up for that. I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "This place is a little gem, tucked away in the side streets of Barnsbury.A 15 minute walk from Angel station set amongst the houses of Victorian suburbia. What makes this place so perfect is that it exists outside the hustle, bustle and commerciality of Islington's Upper Street (which is literally just around the corner).First things first. If you're coming at the weekend expect to queue. I've been here in the week and been seated outside immediately but this most recent visit was at the weekend and the wait was around one hour. Still, there are worse places to wait. The quaint and peaceful surroundings only help to add the experience.Once inside (or outside, there is a Garden to the rear) expect social seating. The place is tiny. Kitchen, cloakroom, stairs to garden, dining room almost all in one. I love it. Don't be put off, it's all part of the joy.The menu is extraordinary. The difficulty will be choosing only one dish to enjoy. On my most recent visit, I had the buttermilk chicken and waffles. Cooked to perfection, delicious and incredibly generous portions for the price (\u00a312). I have to say I was jealous of the my friend's choice of corn fritters, they simply looked amazing.Even with the queue constantly maintaining length and duration outside, there is such a laid back vibe here. Don't expect to be rushed, turned or hurried. Come, relax, enjoy a terrific meal with the friendliest staff you're likely to find anywhere.",

Obviously its not like there's a lack of these places around town, but it's harder to find places that do special food. something extra special compared to your ordinary scrambled eggs or eggs \u00a0Florentine/Benedict.... That's great definitely but can be done so easily. At the moment, my \"extraordinary\" brunch place is Lantana (check out my review!) but this new little place right by my old flats form 5 years ago on Caledonian Road is a gem! Stupid levels of queue all day on Saturday & Sunday. I even heard people are starting queueing during the week too... Mhm... not ideal AT ALL but definitely worth the wait, but I do recommend going as early as physically possible & patiently wait in the queue with your lovely coffee in hand. Went there with a couple of my girl friends so we were able to try quite a few different things ont he menu! Oh my god, what a menu! That's what i can exciting, that's what i cal interesting! I am salivating just thinking about it. Recommendation as follows : Courgette fritters! French toasts & the stacks of pancakes also blew my mind! The savory waffles looks amazing too. Not once did i see a plate and wasn't impressed. I need to go back and try everything.",
