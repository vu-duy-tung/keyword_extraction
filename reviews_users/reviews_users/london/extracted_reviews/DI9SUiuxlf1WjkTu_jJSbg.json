One great thing was that they brought out a jug of tap water and then refilled it when that one was empty - this small gesture bumps up the service a few notches for me. The atmosphere was casual, yet definitely luxe. Skillfully prepared cocktails too (even non-alcoholic ones). It was not an inexpensive night by any means - cocktails, starters, main and a bottle of wine will set you back \u00a360 a head. Save this for a special occasion.",

Instead, if you crave old fashioned cocktails using lesser known ingredients, this place will provide just that. The seated area at the bar is cosy and comfy and feels secluded although it's quite small, it only consists of 4 sofas. The bartenders are very knowledgeable and are happy to make up new cocktails if you tell them what types of spirits and mixers you like.",

    "text": "Hawksmoor - I'd heard so much about the steak and cocktails (all good) I'm surprised it took me this long to visit. My wonderful bestie took me here one night, when we decided to blow the food budget on a night out drinking, celebrating nothing in particular - sometimes you have to do that, right? \u00a0And if you're going to do it; do it in style - Hawksmoor is the place for that.We managed to get a table in the bar downstairs on a busy Saturday night - I felt pretty lucky, because as we were waiting no less than 4 groups came in from the torrential rain asking for a place at the bar - all were turned down *smug face* (I'm allowed to put that because these things never usually happen to me!)It seems they have some sort of policy against overfilling - which I am a BIG fan of - undoubtedly adds to the ambience. \u00a0There is a sort of upmarket American diner theme, with booths and shady lighting - I liked it - \u00a0and the bar is placed so that you can watch the super skilled bartenders create the wonderful cocktails for which Hawksmoor is so famed.Wait staff come to you and the service was impeccable - the right level of friendly and helpful without being overbearing or disingenuous. \u00a0The cocktails themselves (which change monthly I believe) were \u00a0beautiful - I bloody love a good cocktail and these were up there with the best. \u00a0Fruit was fresh (like practically just picked off the tree fresh), presentation was charming and taste was delightfully different. \u00a0There seemed to be a gin theme with the cocktails when I visited, which isn't usually my normal choice - but it's a sign of the quality how much I enjoy them despite my definite preference for vodka and rum. \u00a0Unfortunately the food budget didn't extend as far as food - Oh the irony - the bill for 2 people is on the pricier side \u00a0(but you get what you pay for) \u00a0- so we didn't sample the incredible looking burgers or chips (fries?) that were making their way past us destined for other tables - but I will be back. \u00a0Hawksmoor you have not seen the last of THIS discerning diner ...TBC",

    "text": "O . M . G . (***Think Janice from Friends***)This is everything I heard it was and more. I just got back after our anniversary dinner and this was definitely up there in my top 5 list. I can still feel the juices from the best ever cooked steak purge my alimentary system.Everything was perfect, starting with the online booking (don't miss the semi-animated beef cuts primer on the website). I was somewhat suprised when I first walked in, however, because I was expecting a fairly stiff crowd, quietly portioning their meat and employing cautious decorum while ingesting. Super contrary to my expectations, it almost seemed like your neighborhood pub, albeit a rather fashionably done up one.Our very friendly and informal waiter seemed to know a LOT! He explained the difference between a Porterhouse and Chateaubriand, made recommendations on how best to have it cooked and what it would go with. 5 stars for the service (and tuition)!Did someone recommend chips? Uh-huh! And what a recommendation that was. Get the chips and you won't be disappointed! They're triple cooked! You're gonna need these babies for the Porterhouse - so make sure you always have them by your side!We started with the grilled bone marrow and shallots, an order of the rock oysters and the belly ribs, each one better than the other. Once you eat these Tamworth belly ribs, you will find it hard to order them elsewhere. Now go ahead and order your meat. The daily inventory will be listed on a board and you will be able to see what is available, so make sure you get there somewhat earlier so you don't lose out on the best Porterhouse in London. (Check tip: At this point, you want to make sure that a fresh order of those triple cooked fries is sitting by your side). The Porterhouse is massive. We were two mid to large consumption capacity carnivores and we have to take ~30% of it to go.For pudding, both the sticky toffee pudding with clotted cream and the chocolate brownie are mentionable. Hard to even contain the drool pool while writing this review ...",

    "text": "Have eaten here a lot and it's AMAZING!!!!!! Get ready to spend a lot of money but it's worth it. The chateaubriand is INCREDIBLE, possibly the best steak I've ever had. But the other cuts I've had here have been amazing too. The triple cooked chips, heirloom tomato salad, and mashed potatoes are also delicious. Sometimes real cocktails can be hard to find in London (along with trash cans, mexican food, and anything open past 10pm), but Hawksmoor has a really talented bar staff, huge cocktail menus, and a vast array of exotic liquors- it's hard to choose! My big tip is that if you haven't been able to make a booking, it's often easy to walk-in and get a seat at the bar for dinner. It's fun to watch the talented bartenders and sometimes they give you tastes of weird drinks they're making.The downsides- staff, aside from bartenders, can be a little out of it. The door staff are rude to the point of discouraging. And the limited menu at the downstairs bar (wasabi burger, etc) is kind of bland. But ignore the bitchy hostesses and order the chateaubriand! your arteries will thank me!",

I heard on the grapevine that the food here was good but nothing prepared me for the experience I am about to share with you.On arrival the table was set and the waiter handed me a cocktail menu. At just gone 11:30am I took a long sip of the orange and red drink before me. It was sublime. Which was pleasing to the waiter whom had made the recommendation based on my long term relationship with gin. Lifting the martini glass again to my lips, the 'Johnny goes to London' was going down well, perhaps a little too well.Lunch, not being served until midday we pre-order our meal and at the clock strike of 12:12pm the dishes arrived. Words fail me to describe the absolute pleasure. Rare beef, doughy yet lightly toasted Yorkshire pudding, crisp roasties, tender cabbage and the butteriest carrots.Don't even deliberate this one - pleasure is waiting for you too.",

Great quality steak with great flavour, well executed sides, simple and unfussy. Ordered medium but was definitely much closer to rare. My friends got the same.Deserts were a high point too. Two deserts shared between three of us. We were quite full already but couldn't resist:Nutty brownie with salty caramel ice cream. Yum. I'm a fan of the salty+sweet combination and the brownie was just right, not too heavy and dense.Sticky toffee pudding was one of the best I've had, maybe the best.Inside, the atmosphere was quite lively on a Friday night, as could be expected.

    "text": "This has been on my hit list for a while. T'was Saturday when I discovered it was my mummy's birthday. Ah! Bad child! So in a panic I frantically had to think of fancy schmancy restaurants I can take her to. Since my younger brother is on a no salt, no fat, no fun diet he picked Hawksmoor from the choice I gave him. I was edging for Club Gascon, but his \"no fun\" diet said no. No to the delicious fatty French food. But I was not sad, for I had craving for bone marrow since I tried it in NYC at ... some restaurant I cannot remember the name of \u00a0O_o (will have to edit the name in when my cousin tell gets back to me on that).I should point out I had gone to my first Bikram class before going to the Hawksmoor so was frickin Marvin'. I had booked the table for 7.30pm, but got there at 8pm and they were completely fine with that. In saying that, the table was only for 2 hours, but we were there till 10.30pm. Good stuff. So decided on the whole lobster and bone marrow for the starter. The bone marrow was nice, but it wasn't as good as NYC's Blue Ribbon Restaurant Bone Marrow & Marmalade. The Garlic Butter Lobster was also nice, but on the small side. A reason I tend not to order seafood in the UK. Always so small and just not worth it. I'd rather go Billingsgate Market and make it myself (which I need to do soon). In saying that, it was of course delicious. As my brother is quite the muscle head he was contemplating the 800g Porterhouse for himself. I told him we can go for the 1.2kg Prime Rib and share. The waitress suggested the 800g for us to share. LOL. She does not know us. In the end we settled for the 1kg of Prime Rib cooked medium. I like my meat as bloody as can be, but since the cut is fatty it had to be medium. Still very tasty. \u00a0Not the best steak I've ever had, but it certainly ranks very high. We both took an order of the Roast Field Mushrooms and Roasted Sweet Potato. The mushrooms were too over powering and therefore I did not like it with the steak. The sweet potato was roasted well. I would warn you we did struggle with 1kg of steak. That is a lot of meat for two.My mum went with the Fillet with the Triple Cooked Chips and Stilton Hollandaise sauce. My mum, bless her wanted it well-done. URGH! WOMAN! I told her since I'm paying for this meal you cannot order a fillet steak and ask for it well-done. That's blasphemy! She got it medium rare. Of course I had a taste and OH MY! It was divine. Close to perfection. If I compare the fillet to the one from Gaucho, this definitely came top trumps. As for the chips, they were barely warm so I have nothing good to say about that.  The star of the show has to be the Stilton Hollandaise sauce! Now, I usually don't like sauces with my steak, but this sauce took the steak to a whole new dimension. It is making me salivate thinking about it. When that happens you know its true love. My brother who said his diet was strict tried the sauce and was in love. Ha. (Well he ended up tasting a lot of what is banned in his diet)We weren't drinking alcohol so mum went for the Fresh OJ, delightful for an OJ, just sweet, no tartness. Brother and I went for the Apple & Mint non-alcoholic Mojito, nice and refreshing. \u00a0While my mum nodded off in her seat from being so full, we asked the waitress if we could get a lil birthday dessert with a candle. They were so so nice about it. They brought out the brownie and salted caramel ice cream with a candle and sang happy birthday for her, everyone else in the area also joined along in singing happy birthday. I love that. That made it extra special. I went with a scoop of the salted caramel and a scoop of the cornflake ice cream. I highly recommend to get these flavours together. I loved Hawksmoor. I still want to go for the brunch. But that won't happen anytime soon as that meal made quite the dent on my card.",

    "text": "Oh, my, God. So, it's my birthday and we really wanted to try Hawksmoor. My partner says that it's really hard to choose a place for him to bring me because I'm a fussy foodie and I've tried just about everything in London. While that's somewhat true, we've been dying to try Hawksmoor for quite a while. Anyway, we waltz in for a 6:30 reservation at the Spitalfields branch. We're one of the first ones in the restaurant and all the prime / popular cuts are still up for grabs. How it works with the popular cuts is that you may choose something really large to share between you and your dinner date. They're anywhere from 650g of Chateaubriand to 1.3kgs of a T-bone -- the cuts are updated on a daily basis so they may have smaller cuts or larger ones depending on the day. We were a little adventurous, so we actually didn't want to go with just one cut, but went with two smaller cuts. a Rib-eye and a Fillet. Both medium-rare, with a side of stilton sauce. The wine selection here is also great, albeit a little pricey. The steaks were absolutely perfectly cooked, though the rib-eye had just a little more char which gave it an overall better flavour. The fillet was incredibly tender, tasted smooth as silk and was a little less pink in the centre. The mac and cheese came in it's own little cast iron pot. Now, I'm a huge fan of mac and cheese, and I do miss those cheap, plasticky blue boxed Kraft Mac and Cheese, but this one was definitely the best I've had on this side of the Atlantic. Whilst the meat was absolutely awesome, the sides were a little trop cher (too expensive) for what they were worth. However, the great food, company, wine and atmosphere is definitely worth the coming back for. 2 people, \u00a399 and the experience of a lifetime. 5*s!",

    "text": "A vegetarian reviewing a steakhouse?! What?! I understand if you want to skip this review as a result. But I've been here on more than a few occasions when the partner in crime craves bone marrow. He's obsessed. And the dogs are extremely happy that he's in love with the dish because they get bones (yes, we do awkwardly ask to bring back bones from this very high end steakhouse). Way off topic, let's get back on track. The triple cooked chips are amaze, but I love most of the sides. What I personally don't recommend is the vegetarian main - the roasted winter vegetables with mixed grains and cashel blue. I think it's icky. A lady next to me seemed to enjoy it one time I was there, so to each her own. Your best bet is to grab 1 or 2 meat eating friends and head over there to split a giant slab of meat. While I order the baked beetroot with hazelnuts and horseradish salad (it's so good), my BF pouts about the fact that he has no one who wants to share half a cow. Kidding! He's just as obsessed with the salad as I am. And to balance any perfectly vegetarian meal, their cocktails are fantastic. So go. Get some meat. Or salad. And get boozy.",

We came before 6 to take advantage of their express menu to save a few bucks and got the 3 course meal. I started with the potted mackerel which I personally found to be more salty than I would've liked. I then got ribeye as my main. When I was served the ribeye, I was a bit underwhelmed when it was only a piece of steak on a white plate - like \"wow is this it?\". The presentation could use a bit of work but the steak still tasted pretty good nonetheless - tender and well seasoned. For dessert, we got the apple & rhubarb crisp with vanilla ice cream (always get with ice cream) which was nice. Service was good, nothing too outstanding. Overall given the price and food we got, I would recommend this place to others.",

It was already getting crowded even dot on 12 at Spitalfields, the decor was nice like a homely pub restaurant with plenty of room and seating, we sat in the far main room on the smaller tables and the service was instantly fast where the waiter asked us for drinks almost immediately. For the food, well going there it certainly was an eating extravaganza for the taste buds, we went for the Sunday Brunch and being served within 20 minutes it was worth the wait, we had what seem like beef rump steak pieces which were quite large with Yorkshire pudding, very tasty roast potatoes and sweet carrots with oven roasted garlic and what seem like parsnip with green cabbage. The beef was nice, perfectly cooked as specified medium to rare but it felt cooked and was very moreish and almost took a while to finish. As for the drinks I had the London kernel black ale which was strong but had a smooth taste. We stayed there for a while and even though we turned down the dessert, it is one of the best Sunday brunches I have had!",

    "text": "My first Hawksmoor experience was a glorious one. From now on, this specific Hawksmoor will be my primary choice for a perfect steak.I went with a colleague on a Monday night 30 minutes prior to our reservation and had no issues being seated. We had the smoked salmon and fries as appetizer, and I ordered the sirloin. Instead of pairing the smoked salmon with the soda bread (which was very good by itself), we paired it with the fries - and it was a magical combination: the fat from the fries mixed very well with the salmon. The sirloin came perfectly prepared, with just the right amount of fat and lean meat. It was seasoned very well, not overpowering but complementary. Paired with some mustard greens, it really hit the spot.After a 5-star worthy dinner, we decided to go to the bar for some Manhattan's. Our bar tender Naomi was very helpful in creating the perfect Manhattan for our individual tastes - and was kind enough to let us try the base to see if we liked it. I went with Maker's in a 5:1 mix, and my colleague went with a sweeter raisin rye. I was facing away from the bar chatting with my colleague when I noticed he wasn't paying attention. I looked at what was distracting him, and I saw that he was focused on Naomi's preparation. She was taking great care and pride in creating the Manhattans, double or triple straining as she saw fit - and sprinkling orange peel oils \u00a0with a swift sweeping motion for garnish. As you probably guessed, they were probably the best Manhattan's I've ever had. After two each, we promised we would be back soon. And I will be.",

    "text": "LOVED Hawksmoor in Spitalfields! After hearing rave reviews from friends and colleagues about how fabulous the food is, and how it is \"so much better than Gaucho\" I decided I MUST get my @ss over to Hawksmoor. I decided to make a reservation for Sunday lunch so I can kill two birds with one stone as I was long over-due a Sex and the City style girlie catchup with a close and dear girlfriend. Booked online the day before, so far so good (I was anticipating a full house, and was ready to hit my Plan B, but my fears were unfounded).First things first: if you suffer from colour-blindness or myopia you might, just might, walk or drive past the restaurant, despite it being on the main road in full view. The facade is black, very understated, and not conspicuous at all (much to the frustration of my friend who sauntered past a couple of times!). This I like as I'm of the school of \"let the food speak for itself\", as opposed to the over-stylised eateries that serve inedible slop masquerading as \"food\". Coats are checked in at the door and I was swiftly escorted to my table. As I followed the maitre de (can't spell!), I could feel a warm fuzzy glow emanating through my body \"I really, really like this place!\". The decor is warm, cosy, and with just the right sprinkling of trendy. The staff are welcoming, smiley, and attentive without being over-bearing. Oh, I almost forgot to mention - the staff are also very good-looking. In fact, for a split second, I did find myself wondering: where did they find such good-looking people? Sorry I digress... Let's get onto the food!So my friend finally turns up and we promptly ordered the beef roast dinner and a side of macaroni cheese. The beef can be ordered medium or well done. We both ordered well done. The food arrives and my taste buds were literally doing summersaults in my mouth upon first sight of the roast! It looked awesome! And about as perfect as a roast dinner can be. The Yorkshire pudding was about the size of a human head, with just the right amount of roasties nestled within it. The beef was perfectly done, a whole slab of beef, cooked individually as opposed to shavings from joint. I did have moments of doubt, that I should have ordered the beef medium, but nope, it was delicious as it is. In summary, this is about as perfect a roast lunch can be. Only a couple of things which could make it even better: replace the green veg with another veg (I couldn't work out what it was!) as it was far too bitter, and provide a larger jug of gravy as it was far too small and got cold quickly. Other than that, the perfect sunday lunch! :)",

    "text": "I've been a fan of Hawksmoor ever since I sat down to the Beef Tasting Menu and they blew every preconception I had about what you can do with meat right out of the water. These guys know their steak and ribs, so it was with great anticipation I made my way over there to meet some Yelpers for a chill dinner at the Hawksmoor Spitalfields Bar. And since I've had burgers on the brain as of late, I was set on sampling the vaunted Hawksmoor Cheeseburger. The short version is that compared to the rest of London's burger offerings, the Hawksmoor burger is one of the best (narrowly behind Mother Flipper and Kimchi Cult). However, I think if I was going to Hawksmoor, I'd opt to splurge on the steak or if on a budget, the short rib French dip.Let's discuss the burger. There are three main components that need to be addressed: i) the bun, ii) the toppings, and iii) the patty itself. Bun - Hawksmoor uses a soft demi-brioche style which provides a soft fluffy bun capable of soaking up a ridiculous amount of juices and sauce. The bun has just a slight chewy skin from the browning process which adds a layer of texture to each bite as well. Toppings - Fairly typical toppings of cheese, pickle, tomato, and lettuce. The veggies are ultra fresh with that crisp crunchiness that you can both feel and hear when you bite in. The cheese was gooey and melty in all the right ways. Patty - As you would expect from a top-flight steak house, the meat is proper beef and cook medium rare to ensure the juices explode out of the patty. The burger is soft and marbled with the beef so tender it melts in your mouth which releasing its rich flavour.Overall, great patty, good mix of textures and tastes, and an excellent bun to hold it all in. That was one of the least messy burgers I've had that still tasted awesome. A few minor gripes with the meal however. First ,the burger is on the small side and while decent value at \u00a38.50, it's not quite enough to satisfy your hunger. Gripe #2 was due to the horrendous portion of chips. Now I'll give Hawksmoor the benefit of the doubt as usually the triple cooked chips are one of the highlights of the meal. These tasted more like a soggy bread and if it wasn't for my state of starvation I would have left them uneaten. The ketchup couldn't make up for the lack of crunch and flavour in these chips. Should have gone for the short rib nug nugs.Finally, to wash it down, a tobacco infused old fashioned seemed like just the ticket. It's a tasty drink but prone to over dilution if you don't get it down fast. And who chugs and old fashioned?Oh and decor wise, the new bar at the Spitalfields location is beautiful so extra points for that. In fact, that's knocking it up to 4 stars in my book.That's it. I think this sits #3 on my Burgers of London list (burger quality only counts towards this...otherwise minus points for the chips) but fair warning I'm still to try Lucky Chip, Patty & Bun, and Burger & Lobster so there are definitely some challengers for a top 3 spot in the wings.",

We spent something like $500 for a dinner for two.The Prime Rib was decadently fatty and properly rare as hell. They have a REALLY great method of selling their meat with a chalkboard showing cuts that are \"Available\" and they cross them off as they are sold. It's a brilliant way to make buying meat almost competitive. The appetizers could use a little more polish. We had the Marrow, some crab offering (which was sent back as the least desirable thing we were served all night), and I believe a pate of some sort that was viciously fatty and good. The service was smart and eager, particularly to serve up her knowledge of the cuts of meat. Unfortunately she could use some education on the characteristics of different cuts of beef. For instance she classified the Filet Mignon as \"Buttery and Beefy\" while it's known far and wide that it's a mildly flavored and lean cut that is tender. \"Delicately flavored and Tender\" would be a better classification. That is a VERY minor point that didn't detract from our experience in the slightest. It's just a note for the management who may read this. All in all, it was a pleasant and delicious meal that I would suggest to a friend.",

    "text": "The Hawksmoor Brunch burger - A studied take on my biggest guilty pleasure.How much?: \u00a320 all in with coffee and orange juice (and they had to roll me out)One of the joys of mobile phones (even without the extraneous addition of the now obligatory apps) is the ability to make and rearrange plans at late notice. Unfortunately that also means you can stand people up at late notice, which is how I found myself tucking into my Sausage & Egg HK Muffin as a solo diner. Thankfully I had the paper and a chipper Kiwi knowledgable enough about the football not to make me feel too alone.As many of you will know (and some may dare to outwardly agree with) there's nothing like a lipsmackingly greasy, salty and robustly overcooked sausage and egg mcmuffin from standardised fast-filth vendors MacDonalds when you need to recover from a hangover. There's something about that combination the morning after the night before that sends grown men (and yes, this is mainly a male thing) into eulogies, willing to trek miles to a shop (I refuse to call it a restaurant) that they'd never normally go near. Thankfully the guys behind legendary Liverpool St steakhouse Hawksmoor have gone and created an up-market version.I've been to Hawksmoor inumerable times but have only ever had eyes for their steak. While these are available at brunch, it was the sausage muffin I had my eye on. I'd got there early to grab a table, but the Saturday brunch crowd were conspicuous by their absence. A few early lunchers wander in as I read the paper in the dark wood surrounds, enjoying the early summer sun streaming through the slatted blinds. Clean, friendly, knowledgable and efficient. 5 years of service haven't dented the standards here, I hope it continues when the focus shifts towards their new site opening in Covent Garden soon.The muffin arrives looking promising. While the too runny white lets down the sun yellow yolk of the freerange eggs topping it overall it's a more than worthy classier homage to its high street inspiration. The pork, beef and mutton sausage is a strong, dense patty and full of good fatty flavour. The Ogleshield cheese is a worthy addition, softly yielding, not over-flavoured, soaking into the freshly baked muffin.Alongside it I'm foolish enough to have the short rib bubble and squeak. Foolish because this is a meal in itself. \u00a34 gets you a very generous portion of roughly mashed potato, buttery greens with a fresh bite swirled in with large, moorish shards of tooth sticking short back rib. Served in an iron skillet, the dish is topped with a thick meaty gravy. As I say, a step to far, but reader, I ate it all...A significant improvement on Automat's brunch burger and at \u00a38, half the price. It's a guilty pleasue like its namesake but one I'll certainly be back for.",

    "text": "\"Hawksmoor? I've been wanting to go there for ages!\" seems to be a common refrain amongst those as yet uninitiated in the ways of this none-too-minor celebrity venue on the London carnivores' circuit. Two of the most oft-cited reasons are the cocktails and the generously-proportioned, exquisitely-prepared, Ginger Pig-sourced steaks - both of which I've now sampled. I went along with a gang of 10 to an evening organised 'specially by Qype and the Hawksmoor crew, aimed squarely at showing us what they can offer, and unabashedly at getting some decent online reviews out of it, the wheels of which intention they oiled extremely well by watering us for free all evening. We were treated to a semi-private room off to the side from the main restaurant, a lowly-lit and richly-upholstered platform which managed to seem intimate while still seating a maximum 12 or so. Cocktails were the early order of service and the list was so extensive that I simply gave up and asked for \"something with Hendricks gin in it\", a slightly feeble cop-out that was nonetheless met with a smile and, in time, a really bloody good cocktail - perhaps predictably featuring mint and cucumber, but matched delightfully with the spirit, allowing a hint of bite, but still smooth as you like. (Well, smooth as I like, which is \"very smooth indeed\"). A bottle of Ram\u00f3n Bilbao 2007 Rioja was decanted in preparation for the meal and we made our selections from the menu whose categories took in \"Steaks\", \"Sides\", and \"The rest\", with the latter designation including the excellently opaque \"Vegetarian\". That's what you're getting, vegetarian, like it or lump it. Quite a variety of fish and seafood adorned the collection of starters but of course I'd have none of it, and headed straight for the Tamworth belly ribs, which turned out to be quite a smart move. Succulent, tender pork was served on the bone with a chili and honey-glazed sauce lending a gentle tang to offset what might otherwise have been seen as slightly under-crisped belly fat but which, in the combination presented, worked well, the rib meat and the browned sauce adding texture and the fat bringing yet further moisture and flavour to the party. The recent late flowering of sunny days meant that we were able to get hold of what must surely have been one of the last few jugs of Hawksmoor Summer Punch served this year, a concoction of strawberry and some mysterious sort of magic that seemed to be switching off sections of my brain at a rattling pace, prompting me to switch in turn to the Rioja after only a few glasses, for fear of doing something ridiculous without even knowing it. The wine was a Tempranillo and Garnacha blend, rich and quite bold but not too shouty, and it flowed happily all through the meal. For the main course two of my companions and I opted to share a 950-gramme porterhouse steak, which I went for largely because I'd never had one before - only to discover that it's very similar to a T-bone, just cut more from the rear end of the short loin and so comprising more tenderloin meat. Suits me. 950 grammes is a lot of steak, even if the bone apparently takes up 50-70 grammes, and split between 3 of us it was a decent 10oz steak each, served sliced and, at our host's suggestion, medium rare, which turned out in Hawksmoor terminology still to be a nice dark rich purply red inside a properly charred exterior. This was excellent steak. No sauce, no pretension, just a little crystal sea-salt which brought the meat's flavour even further out. A confident, rich flavour, the charring unable to overpower the long, full beefy tone. The Hawksmoor's association with the Ginger Pig is a fruitful one, and they know what they're doing with what they get. We ordered some side salads that strangely no-one seemed too fussed about, but the tomato was noteworthy, fresh and tasting slightly of sunlight like the best ones do. The chips were OK, not exactly lacklustre but could have been a bit crisper and a bit hotter; the potato gratin, on the other hand, was killer. Dessert was for me an obvious choice - a cheese platter consisting of cheddar, soft blue and some mild goat, washed down with a half-bottle of spicy Dixon's 10-year tawny port between 4 of us. This would realistically have been quite enough, but as I was surrounded by people who'd ordered the most amazing chocolate brownie glories which they weren't quite able to polish off, I had to dive in and help out. Obviously. So all round, this was a great evening at Hawksmoor: low-key but stylish surroundings, an array of superb meat, friendly and accommodating staff plying us with booze all the way through, and when I go back, I reckon I'll be piling in to the ribeye and the Chateaubriand. I notice that other reviews have made much of the apparently high drinks prices; while I can't really comment on them as I was fortunate enough not to have to pay them much attention, the food was by no means cheap, but it was fairly",

We almost felt like it was a inconvenience for us to be there. (no smiles, or no explanation of the steak menu at all. All she told us about the menu was that they had run out of the ribs) The restaurant was so noisy by a few drunks on our next table shouting at eachother that we could barely hear ourselves thinkWe found a hair in the wine, and the Rib-eye steak 400g which cost \u00a328 each probably had about a 100g worth of fat that i trimmed off it, and the mushroom sauce was luke warm. To be honest the best part of the meal was the side order of mushrooms. For the 2 fatty steaks, 1 glass of wine, 1 bottle of water, 1 small pot of chips, and a dish of mushrooms came to \u00a386.00 Rachele tried to charge us for an extra 2 cocktails on our bill we didn't order with the 1st bill TOTALLING \u00a3114They had the cheek to charge us \u00a39.63 service charge without asking us (the service was supposed to be 'optional')To finish it off, we were completely ignored at the reception area on the way out too.I'm amazed this place has so many good reviews.For me it was just a average overpriced steak, with poor service and the whole experience left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.Maybe we caught the Hawksmoor on a bad day, buti would never return here, or recommend to friends.",

    "text": "The ratings I'm giving shouldn't be taken to read that this restaurant is average. It's actually a very pleasurable experience, but you pay fine dining prices for it. The wine list is very good, but the prices are absurdly inflated, and there are very few wines under \u00a350 worth having. It's abusive, frankly, and if restaurants seriously believe that diners aren't aware of this, they are living in a vacuum. However, the meat is tremendous. I doubt there's a better steak in London. The cuts are all from the Ginger Pig, so the origin is flawless. I had a monster sirloin which was pure hedonism and carnivorous sensuality. Lots of noise, atmosphere and fun, and typical London service - i.e. nothing special. Good, but stupidly pricey. For this money I can feed exactly the same food and wine to four times the number of people, in my own home. 8 October 2009 update: Hawskmoor have kindly approached me about this review today via Twitter. It is very gratifying when establishments show they care about their reputation by engaging directly with their customers. They said that \"wine and steak in particular are good value\" with \"much lower mark-ups than most places.\" I will give the Hawksmoor another go as a result. Lots of people love it and that must be for a reason. I won't amend my original review, because it reflects the experience I had, but I will say this: a place that listens to feedback and takes it seriously deserves respect, and a second chance. I look forward to another steak!",

    "text": "I want to start this review with 'Hawksmoor is basically London's best steakhouse' and it is. My first venture to the Covent Garden branch was wonderful \u00a0darkly lit decadence filled with a muted roar of deep chatter, amazing steak and buttered carrots. The second venture to Hawksmoor was to the slightly more hall-like Guidhall (Bank). Both were for dinner, and both splenddid. But after brunch at Spitalfields I can away with a feeling of 'rather good'. I suspect the problem was that I expected more from the dinners they're famed for. True, the East London brand set up is more mellow. The brunches, served in the windowless bar downstairs \u00a0perfect for a hangover \u00a0are American styled. And it's impossible not to order a cocktail (Marmalade \u00a0amazing). We had Hot Dogs, a Burger, and got excited over the sides, with chicken wings, fries (perhaps worth going for these alone, honestly) and spare-rib nuggets (deep-fat fried spare rib meat). 50% of the food I loved and would give 5 stars to, the other half I'd give a lower grade, and that's what let it down \u00a0just a few touches. First class presentation, I didn't leave feeling that I'd had the best hot dog of my life. Actually, I found myself picking around the slightly odd caremalised onions to where the sausage was. Once I had, it was very tasty but the extra bits of beautiful presentation weren't that tasty (e.g. cute mustard and ketchup but no warning to say 'No Thanks!'). It was lovely, wonderful, but a little ordinary for what I expect from Hawksmoor. I'd have left a little unhappier had it not been during the soft launch. Opt for Seven Dials for dinner instead.",

Our waiter provided terrible service, and fortunately for him, I didn't catch his name. He was unfamiliar with his menu - we often had to point items out after he'd tell us he didn't know what we were asking for - and he was incredibly slow with delivery. Our appetizer, oysters, arrived 45 minutes later with one oyster fork for the 5 of us to share. My beer that I ordered before my meal arrived during my final bites. It took him about 30 minutes to come back to our table post-ordering to tell us that one of the items was out. Definitely an unnecessary delay. He never checked in or asked us how things were going. We had to be completely proactive with him. When we left, we told the hostess that we had had some problems with service, and made a joke that perhaps he was hungover and needed a coffee. Rather than be professional, she joked that they were all moving slowly today. Ridiculous. Amazing food is no excuse for horrendous service. It was an embarrassing showing, and I won't be back.",

    "text": "For photos see Greedy Diva @ greedydiva.blogspot.com/\u2026 \u00a0\"We almost didn't put that on the menu - we thought \"who'd have steak and half a lobster for breakfast?\"\" Will, co-owner of Hawksmoor, and I looked over in unison at TPG, a man up to his elbows in rib eye and lobster meat. There's always one in every crowd. Hawksmoor is a steak house in East London famed for serving up great quality British beef, grilled on charcoal to blissful perfection. All meat is sourced from the Ginger Pig, and steaks are, patriotically, from Longhorn cattle, reared in Yorkshire and aged for around 35 days. On Saturday, we were there to test out the first trial run of Hawksmoor's new breakfast menu. Thus, the need for TPG to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the hefty surf 'n turf option. The weekend brunch menu revolves around quality meat products and bears the usual array of Hawksmoor's staples - the steaks, the infamous burger - and some fabulous new additions such as my Sausage and Egg HK Muffin (\u00a38) or (for \u00a330) the full English for two - comprising a bone-in bacon chop, sausages (pork, beef and mutton), short rib bubble 'n squeak, grilled bone marrow, trotter baked beans, Bury black pudding, roast tomatoes, grilled mushrooms and endless thick slices of dripping toast... all with an onion and bone marrow gravy. The HK muffin had wooed me from afar, practically wolf whistling from across the room on someone else's plate. It tasted as good as it looked. Two runny fried eggs are piled into a lovely thick grilled muffin bun with a spicy flat sausage made from pork, beef and mutton, all topped with Ogleshield cheese. The only slightest critique I can offer is that the sausage was slightly too \"spiced up\" for me. I added Ginger Pig bacon, which is the closest thing I've had to the best of Australia's mouthwatering bacon in this country. TPG's steak was so sublime it made us seriously weak at the knees. Perfection. He had it medium, as recommended by our helpful waitress for the rib eye cut, to really get the fatty marbling melting through the meat. If you're a steak and eggs man, this one's for you. TPG saddled it up decadently with a half lobster (add 12 quid), which was slightly overcooked and rubbery. Still, nothing could detract from our adoration of the rest of his plate. We teamed up our selections with some of HK's renowed fabulous drinks. I was feeling fiesty so opted for the Bloody Mary #10 - made with a refreshing cucumber hit and the bite of horseradish. Loved it! TPG, predictably, could not go past the cornflake milk milkshake. That's right folks - the cornflakes are soaked in milk overnight, drained (there are no \"bits\" in it) and then the milk is used to make the ice cream for what is undoubtedly THE BEST FLAVOURED MILKSHAKE in the entire universe. It's even knocked Shake Shack's salted caramel from the top of the perch. This seems to be some variation on similar shakes offered at my beloved Momofuku Bakery in New York - an ingenious addition to the breakfast menu. We eventually retired, content and bellies full, to the bar to watch the masterful hands of Shaky Pete at work. Pete is not only super friendly, but a cocktail guru. He whipped me up a refreshing ginger brew in no time - ginger, lemon, beer and other secret ingredients giving it a sassy sorbet texture. It's like the best shandy you've ever imagined. Highly recommended. TPG obviously felt he needed to show his sophisticated side after the milk shake, and chose a superb armagnac. Layers of chocolate, toffee and other delights wafted up to the nose and romanced the palate. Gorgeous. We are hunting down a bottle for home (if only TPG had not washed since he wrote the name on his hand). Pricing on the new day time menu seems fair. It's not a dirt cheap breakfast, but you're getting top quality ingredients, perfectly executed at a very reasonable price. It's good value. Even better was the pricing on Saturday since we were trialling the menu at a 50% discount to allow any kinks to be ironed out before the official launch this week on 13th March (although I've quoted the full prices here). The worst thing about the new weekend brunch menu is the complete inability to decide what to have - what can't you live without? Other new lunch options include the roast beef (roasted on charcoal and finished in the oven to achieve that \"roasted on a spit flavour\") with dripping roast potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, carrots, greens and bone marrow & onion gravy. My stomach just rumbled while typing. And, of course, there's the Hawksmoor burger. We had devoured one recently (Valentines Day doesn't get more romantic than this) and it certainly lives up to its reputation. Gloopy, loosely packed meat from Longhorn cattle (a range of cuts) is enriched by globs of fatty bone marrow in the mix. A simple salad, pickles, mustard mayo and simple brioche bun are, idyllicly, the only distractions from the main game. On this",

It's London Pride mixed with Ginger Beer and sorts. It's so damn addictive and tasty. The other thing you should be trying while sipping on this is some chips, some ox cheek nuggets (with some incredible kimchi sauce to dip)as well as some chicken wings.The main event will always be the thing voted top 10 small eats in London. The French Shortrib ox cheek bun. With a gravy boat to dip into. This is my guilty pleasure. This is my top sinful eat in London.

All I can say is that this is the type of meal that stays in your mind days after you had it. I can still taste the pink beef, massive Yorkie's, fluffy but crispy roast potatoes... I still drool thinking about it and all this for \u00a320. I did have other bits and pieces (My staples being the Bone Marrow and Scallops- make sure YOU order these every time too!!), but the roast itself is only \u00a320 and as I said in the beginning, worth every single penny!You will have to wait a bit for the Sunday Roast (15-20min approx), but that is due to the dish being made fresh for you (and I guess to rest the meat).Service was swift and unobtrusive (Paula, thank you). Ambience is lively, but I won't say loud.Overall, make the effort to go and eat there- The food is the star attraction and your taste buds will thank you for it.",

Isn't that, like, the french dip's thing?Anyway, had great service all night and when an order got missed it was fixed very quickly and with sincere apologies. My only issue was the grease hanging in the air and the stuffiness. Put a kitchen in a basement without any windows/circulation and you get a very gross environment. I left feeling like a had a film on me :/ But I would definitely recommend a post-work drink and dinner here if you want a good piece of grilled meat without the big cost",

The starters average around \u00a312 each, the house bottle of wine is \u00a325, the fillet steak is \u00a334 for 200grams. However, the food is all wonderful.I enjoyed every course and every side and the steak was cooked absolutely perfectly. There is a good ambiance in the restaurant and the service was attentive and friendly. The staff knew the menu very well and, although of course they were mostly upselling, a lot of their suggestions were helpful.In short everything was delicious.

The wine list was quite extensive and we opted for a Merlot which was quite sharp but went well with the food. As the restaurant filled up I ordered the rib eye medium rare and was told that it had a bit of fat, but had a lot of flavour. The other half ordered the fillet blue. We also got sides of creamed spinach, buttered greens, and mac n cheese.My steak was ok. It was very sinewy and I found it quite hard to cut at times. Next time I will order the fillet as my other half had a gorgeous piece of meat which melted in your mouth. The creamed spinach was amazing, and the buttered greens were nice. The mac n cheese was not the best I've had.. but it was a good try. I almost opted out of a dessert, but the BF insisted we have one because he knows how much I LOVE ice cream. We got a scoop of the popcorn and a scoop of the cornflake. And wow! just wow. Forget the steaks I'm coming for the ice cream next time.",

When you click on the Hawksmoor, you can actually find a poutine review whereas a random selection of other restaurant hits bring such poor results.Enough about my Yelp complaints. The Hawksmoor has several restaurants in the area and many menus. I was having trouble finding poutine proof until a FB inquiry proved fruitful. The Spitalfield location has two kitchens so be sure to go downstairs for the poutine.The bar menu has a small selection of Food, Sides (poutine and more), Puddings, and Cocktails. I ordered the oxtail poutine and the Hong Kong Phooey Reloaded. I'm a sucker for peer pressure. Why else would I have a cocktail that blends 7 different spirits and tastes like vitamin water. Evil deceptive creature. My friend ordered the triple cooked chips, Marmalade Cocktail, and the chili cheese dog.Everyone was happy. The oxtail poutine was delicious. I was hoping for cheese curds, but at least there was some cheese. The focus clearly was on the savory and spicy oxtail soaking the chips with its delicious juices. In the end, I was using triple cooked chips to clean the iron dish spotless. And the chilli cheese dog delighted my friend. She especially enjoyed the cheese on this hearty dish. i definitely recommend this place.",

    "text": "Honestly, one of the best steaks I've had anywhere... pricey, but perfectly done (consistently) and those chips... oh, those triple cooked chips!I've been to a few of their other locations, but this is the one with the most character, in my opinion, and I believe it is the original one... it has a rustic yet fancy feel, but not too imposing compared to similar establishments. To me the best way to enjoy this place is to come with a friend, or a few friends, and get a big ole honkin' steak to share if you're in the same mind as to prep, cut, etc. Last time I went was with about four other people and we split one large steak, by weight off of the board, ordered a smaller one of a different cut, \u00a0and a few sides... absolutely divine. The service is attentive and friendly, fitting for the atmosphere, and it has a fun bar with interesting cocktails (The Shaky Pete's Ginger Brew is a must try, the rumours are true) for those dining upstairs.The only thing I would say is that if you're not a steak person then obviously this may not be the place for you... they have other options, but steak is what they're rightfully known for so if you're a steak lover feeling like a splurge give it a go!Make sure you check out the downstairs bar if you're in the mood for something different and more relaxed, it has a few overlapping things on the menu such as the Shaky Pete's and those triple cooked chips... oh, those chips (have I mentioned the chips?), but the downstairs has a completely different feel and menu. Unfortunately you cannot cross order from the menus, so if you want a gorgeous steak then upstairs is the only option, etc., but definitely check out the reviews for the downstairs bar... if the upstairs doesn't float your boat then the downstairs may be just the ticket. Unless something had changed drastically you really need to book here, but it's worth it.",

That said, if you're in the mood for roast beef, or have never been here, go here. Then go enjoy a hipster beer somewhere in shoreditch.Dress code - well I feel like you should make some effort.

Don't make the mistake of going to the right hand door if you only want the bar; I suffered the tongue of a snooty man when I did!It's a real casual affair downstairs but the decor, atmosphere and staff are spot on. I've only been in a group of two or three and when it's not so busy they allow you to sit where you want. They have 3 huge booths that sit around 10 people which I choose to avoid as I'd rather not be that inconsiderate group talking up too much space!The bar menu is naturally shorter than the main restaurant with a focus on finger foods. For starters I had the ox cheek nuggets; fried nuggets that are oozing with cheese and ox cheek meat. They're so tasty and are accompanied by a tomato based dip that has a tiny edge of spice to it. The pork ribs are immense with soft meat that falls away from the bone with complete ease, you get a good amount for a starter and the marinade they're covered in is the right side of sweet.For main, the cheeseburger is a great choice especially when having it pink as it just tastes amazing. Soft enough to fall apart in your mouth but firm enough to be eaten cleanly without it disintegrating in your hands after a few bites (pet hate with some burgers and their buns).The bar itself has a great selection of drinks on hand; the food menu features a selection of classics and their occasional special cocktails but should you not see something on there, the team usually seem happy enough to knock up a cocktail for you.To top it all off, the staff are a lovely bunch of friendly people with a sense of humour to boot; they make their job seem so effortless and always have a smile on their face.

    "text": "I'm fond of beef - it's no secret. The juicier and more tender, the better. And when I'm paying premium rates, size -does- matter.Thanks to Haley F for organising Steak Night 2.0, I had an excuse to stuff my face with some superlative slabs of meat at the Hawksmoor. Similar to their exceptional Sunday roast, the bovine remains they have on offer are executed superbly. As are the cocktails on their drinks menu.Admittedly, the experience here would have been dramatically improved had our server not been quite as much of a dominatrix. Though she wasn't sporting fishnet stockings, high-heel boots, or wielding a riding crop, her demeanour was pretty much what I'd expect from a woman who brooks no backtalk and knows what's good for you, even if you don't necessarily agree.My recommendation is to go heavy on the sides. You can't go wrong. The thrice-cooked chips are salted to perfection and crisped to an ideal consistency, the creamed spinach is satisfyingly decadent, and the cheesy mac comes in a cast-iron skillet with plenty of crunchy bits for all.All told, for a drink or two, a filling portion of rib-eye, and a sampling of sides, the per head cost ran about \u00a360. Not affordable by any means, but quite commensurate to both quality and value. The Hawksmoor is certainly worthy of a return visit - hopefully with a server that's somewhat less domineering and when there isn't a drunktastic birthday party going on at the table just next to us!",

    "text": "I've been looking forward to visiting Hawksmoor for a very long time and this is not any old Hawksmoor this is the original in Spitalfields. A pleasant concierge greeted us and quickly showed us to our, un-reserved, seats. It was a quiet Bank Holiday Monday so assume to book in advance to be guaranteed a seat.The restaurant was fairly busy with a mixture of customers. Seemingly a good date venue, for men looking to splash some cash but equally welcoming of larger groups and families.The decor, to be honest looked a little dated. Not worn but dated. An old fashioned vibe, which I like, but an un-natural, tried, environment (Soho House do it better).The menu was simple and, obviously, meat-centric (which is no bad thing). We opted to stick to the menu rather than go for the specials on the board, which is something I now regret. I started with the Hawksmoor smoked Salmon. At \u00a315 it was nothing to blow my mind. A small portion of fish with some soda bread and salad. Main coarse was the filet steak, 300g. I chose mine rare, which is how I always prefer my steak cooked but, again, in this instance something I now regret. A tasty enough cut of meat, overly salted and with an almost mushy texture. My expectation, of the best steak in London, was sadly not met on this occasion. The meal with wine was \u00a372pp. For me the experience and food didn't live up to the billing and certainly not to the price. I'd go again, for sure but this time with the specials board on the agenda. This is definitely the type of place where to have a good time you need to go all in (\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3).",

    "text": "I have finally giving a five star and it has been a long time coming. Firstly I could of have giving this review the first time I came here a few years ago but I deliberately held out until I have giving this place another visit which would lead me to a more balance review. \u00a0So let's talk about the service. It was truly great as it was not only my wife's birthday but also our anniversary (yes I the same day!) meaning it was a big day for us. It started with the phone call to book a table for two and the moment I have them my name they said, \"hey your already on our system, can we confirm your address and number is...\" This made a good impression straight away as not only they kept my personal details but they also knew why we came the first time and they said they will prepare a nice dessert which ended up being on the house. \u00a0The location is one of those places you don't even have to try, you will just miss it as it is a dark black building with only the resturant name above the door and if you do glimpse in you would be excuse for thinking it is a pub or posh pub with a couple of tables. Now the food was a top standard throughout even when they brought my medium rare sirloin steak rare, there was no fuss or issues they just took it away and cooked it again exactly how I liked. Even when the wife thought the cream spinach was not great once again they said don't worry about it, it is off the bill. The waiter was absolutely fantastic to the point of sitting down and going through our options with us and spending that quality time to help create that environment that we enjoyed. As mentioned earlier on, the dessert for both of us was on the house and it was a real nice touch that they decorated the plates to signify our double celebration and to be honest the plate decor was all I was expecting as they said on the phone when I was booking they would do that, so we were both nicely surprised. I love coming here, you don't feel rushed or pressured. It is a very relaxed chilled out atmosphere and I know we will surely be back here!",

    "text": "It's been a while since I've made it here even though I used to work close by. \u00a0Reputed to have the best steak in London I've always wanted to try Hawksmoor and what better one than the original. On a busy night, service was pretty good, fast and friendly despite the number of tables each waiter had to cover. \u00a0It's a nice restaurant where everything seems to work which creates a nice overall steak restaurant vibe. \u00a0We decided to dive straight into mains with loads of sides: A 1kg Porterhouse, 1 Lobster, bone marrow, chips, jersey royals, macaroni cheese, creamed spinach, mushrooms, and bearnaise sauce. The lobster had a nice garlic butter sauce and was a pretty good size for a native. \u00a0The bone marrow was a pretty generous portion too although dry and salty (some pieces had no marrow). \u00a0As we delved into more of the food it was apparent the chefs like their salt here. \u00a0The steak was especially salty - borderline of being inedible. \u00a0The sides were good though, in fact all the sides were good.But more than just being salty the fillet side of the Porterhouse was horrible: mushy and it had an old after-taste to it. \u00a0They did quickly rectify this and we were brought another Porterhouse in 5 minutes which was much better, not easy to do during a busy service. \u00a0Though still over salted the meat texture was correct as were the natural meat flavours that struggled to break through the heavy seasoning. We were kindly offered free desserts, but we were stuffed so a bottle of red was on the house. \u00a0It was unfortunate our first steak was bad, but they did give us another one without argument and I can understand that it's not totally possible to taste each steak that goes out. But even ignoring that first steak, the over seasoning is a bit of an issue. \u00a0Was it the best steak I've had in a London restaurant? \u00a0That award still goes to Maze Grill, maybe Maze got lucky that time and I just happened to get an amazing piece of meat that was packed full of fresh meaty flavour and perfectly cooked. They say you should never meet your heroes, you'll only be disappointed. \u00a0Maybe the hype killed it for me, but it has a reputation for a reason. \u00a0Unfortunately Hawksmoor was only good at best, with many steaks being at least equal to the one I had at their original restaurant.",

The waiter could surely tell, but was completely professional and did his job while letting us have fun.I shared one of the larger cuts and found it to be cooked to perfection, with just the right balance between tenderness and doneness. \u00a0The bernaise sauce on the side put it over the top; it's amazing how quickly 450g (ok, some of it was bone...) can disappear in such a short span.Would recommend out for a special treat or just a really good steak!",

MmMmMmmmm!The decor is nice, quite dark and intimate, and what seems to be standard steak restaurant fair at the moment.So three stars then? Well, the place is a posh restaurant masquerading as a chilled place to dine and you can feel it! The staff try to be casual in their brushed cotton checked shirts while waving wine lists worthy of Mayfair restaurants under your nose. It's probably the close proximity to the city but great steak does not have to come with wine at \u00a360+ a bottle and there is a very limited number of wines served by the glass. There are a small number of more economic wines but it works out better to hit the cocktails! I can highly recommend the old fashion with rye! Also, a point worth a mention, we checked out they sell their steaks before we went but for those that haven't or don't regularly eat in this type of restaurant you order by weight and the steaks are priced by the 100g so with the larger or sharing ones sold by how availability of each cut by weight so you don't know how much it will necessarily cost unless you do your mental arithmetic first. Not a crazy problem but just worth noting if you don't have unlimited funds!Overall our experience was pleasant and the food good but I won't be rushing back!",

It's a limited time item and quite the experience! So glad I acquiesced.The burger is buttermilk fried turkey, a sausage patty, smoked bacon, sprout tops, spiced cranberry ketchup, and a slice of Ogleshield cheese. The taste you really get out of it is a bit of the sausage, some turkey and cheese, and the cranberry ketchup. Dipping it in the side of turkey gravy just makes that much better.As for puddings, the Salted Caramel Rolos and Peanut Butter Shortbread were definitely worth the guilt. Don't pass them up!

    "text": "When my friend was visiting from the states and wanted to meet for lunch on Sunday, my first thought was a Sunday Roast. I make a pretty mean roast myself so it's hard for me to want to go out and get it. But where have I had the best Sunday Roast in London? Hawksmoor. Given he's a huge fan of musicals, I decided to not go to the Hawksmoor that I usually go to (Air Street) and instead try out the one in Spitalfields so he can see a different area of London.Unfortunately, we were a bit late in meeting him, but he managed to find it, and they had already seated him. We sat talking for a bit, and finally decided on some delicious Portuguese wine and a round of roasts for the three of us. (HIs was more well done, ours was pink).The roast was delicious as always. Moist and succulent meat with a whole head of roasted garlic and some roasted shallot. Amazing Yorkies and potatoes with some greens and carrots. Add in a delicious horseradish sauce and some bone marrow gravy, and life is golden. My partner and I also opted for the side of roast bone marrow because bone marrow.We also got a few sides including the triple cooked chips (the ones I make at home are better) and the mushrooms (yum). We also had dessert. I got the Crunchy bar which was amazing. Mostly decadent chocolate with a bit of salted caramel and honeycomb. My partner got the rolos because they are also amazing. My friend got the sticky toffee pudding. After trying to explain to him for a couple of minutes what clotted cream was like, we finally settled on telling him it's got the consistency of softened butter but is slightly sweeter. But he definitely enjoyed it, even though it did end up becoming sticky toffee pudding soup (he wanted it all mixed well).However, the service at this one is definitely more laid back and casual, and it was kind of annoying. We were often left alone, and having to ask for more water when we could. I think Air Street is still my preference, but it's always nice to get a bit of a change.",

For example, under sides, they didn't have asparagus, which Hawksmoor Seven Dials has. \u00a02) The restaurant was less spacious but on the flip side, it was more cozy and hipster. \u00a0Probably the better choice if you're looking for a more intimate meal.My love for Hawksmoor continues!",

I had English Strawberry Meringue and Peanut Butter Shortbread with Salted Caramel Ice Cream. Both tasted sweet and delicious yet distinct, and are definitely hard to find anywhere else.

I called all around: the Holly Bush, the Dock Kitchen, the Garrison, the Wells and all were fully booked or only had reservations after 3:00. I wanted to kick myself for not doing better pre-planning!And then I came upon it in an article in the Guardian. Best UK Sunday Lunch 2010: Hawksmoor, London. I rang them up and viola! A table for two at 12:30 secured!At first blush I liked the place with its warm, rustic feel and a friendly staff, some of whom, like us, were still waking up. Mum let me do the ordering and I called for one roast rump with all the trimmings (I mean, what's Sunday lunch without a Yorkshire pud?) I also got us the short rib bubble and squeak and the creamed spinach. In a dish certainly more appropriate for two came slabs of roast beef, a Yorkshire pudding bigger than most people's faces, carrots, potatoes and some greens. Add horseradish and you have a flawless meal! Never before have I been more pleased with a Sunday roast.The creamed spinach and bubble and squeak were also nice but next time I'll concentrate on the beef and all its trimmings (and there's always dessert...)To cap off our pre-Christmas celebration we shared a sticky toffee pudding with clotted cream. It was as decadent as you might imagine. I'm already planning my next Sunday excursion to Hawksmoor. Who's coming with?!",

We visited the Spitalfields branch during our August trip and it has a quiet kind of swagger.The cocktail list is super in-depth, with lots of commentary. I had some kind of gin drink and my boyfriend a whiskey drink; both were good, though at a high cost.To start, we had bone marrow with caramelized onions (8 pounds), which was a great pairing and a huge portion for the price. Definitely get this if you're a bone marrow fan.We split a nice-sized chateaubriand (13 pounds per 100g, portions starting around 300g) with peppercorn sauce on the side. So good... perfectly cooked to medium rare. Great juicy texture and meaty flavor, with a mild sear. The side of mushrooms was probably good for our health, but skippable.Overall, this is reliable luxury food at reasonable prices. Service was fine; there were many bathrooms. It wasn't overly busy on a Monday but I would recommend booking ahead for the weekend.",

It's quite casual for a quality steak house and there was a lively vibe that made you feel welcomed.But let's not kid ourselves, the food is excellent! Juicy, perfectly cooked porterhouse steak for two and all the sides were amazing. Super cheesy mac and cheese went well with the decadent bone marrow. The chips were on par as was the well seasoned Caesar salad. The sauces were equally delicious: Stilton hollandaise and peppercorn gravy. Service was on point, orders taken on time and brought out quickly. The drink menu suits the establishment. They really know their meats here but also offer a nice selection of seafood including lobster. (Next time!) The dessert menu nearly tempted us but after a big, delicious meal we couldn't have fit another bite!",

I was expecting some sort of heavy doughy dumpling kind of thing but it turned out to be light and flaky! Add unique potted meat under an airtight butter seal and delicious gravy and Yorkshire pudding turned out to be truly delicious!However, while the food was excellent, the service was truly the difference maker.We arrived early and sat at the bar on the main floor for a while. Johnny the bearded bartender from Spain, provided excellent service and drinks. He was friendly and enthusiastic and his delicious libations truly got us going in the right direction for a wonderful evening. The drink with strawberry infused gin was definitely outstanding. My wife actually enjoyed a gin-based drink and she's never been a fan of the gin until now, perhaps only at Hawksmoor in London!For history buffs who have perhaps read this far, I decided to learn more about the origin of the Hawksmoor name. As you might expect in London, a rich history awaited discovery!In 1711, parliament passed a law to build fifty new churches in London and Westminister. I believe the idea was to encourage the population to get more involved with organized religion. While only twelve churches were ultimately built, Hawksmoor designed six of them and contributed to the design of two others! The six churches designed by Hawksmoor were St Alfege's, St George's, Christ Church, St George in the East, St Mary Woolnoth and St Anne's Limehouse. Perhaps we'll visit them all on our next trip!",

The fillet's were brought to the perfect temperature and sliced just right. The Peppercorn and hollandaise sauces for the steak and broccoli were magical. The mash potatoes were rich and filled with flavor. As an American, I instantly tasted the difference in quality of meat compared to what is grown and raised in the states. My eyes are now opened to the full flavor of hormone-free grass-fed steak. Hopefully the U.S / U.K trade talks won't force Britain down the path of cheap tasteless beef. Thank you Hawksmoor Spitalfields for the great meal!",

To drink we had a bottle of Pinot Noir from my home state of Oregon. The wine was light and delicious, perfecgt with the steak we had. In total we sent around 400 quid. Worth it and will be back.",

Both were flavourful on the outside (nice and charred) but both steaks were TOUGH and mine super gristly and fatty. I had half of the 400g still in the plate at the end, just a pile of fat. And my partner's - good fillet should melt in the mouth and be super soft, but it was chewy and flavourless on the inside.This place is VERY expensive and I would expect the steak to be top notch - but it wasn't for me. \u00a0Sides are delish and wine list extensive, but I won't go back, as there are too many better places than this. Went on a Friday night and yes it was very busy, but the service was terribly slow. We waited far too long for our mains, like 40 plus minutes. When you go to a high end place, it shouldn't matter how busy it is - you should expect the same level of service as if it were a Wednesday. I'd say try a place where you get better value for money. I really don't see how they warrant the price for the quality that you get - won't be going back unfortunately.",

I mainly wanted a great piece of meat, some amazing wine, and an environment where I could melt away a bit and decompress. Fortunately I was seated in a corner table where I could have fun people watching while being able to sip away on my glass of wine.I will certainly recommend the garlic scallops, filet (with Stilton spread... when in England, right?), and sticky toffee pudding for dessert. Wine list had some good choices by the glass, but certainly better off to bring some friends so you can sample from their larger selection.If I find myself back in the area, I'd certainly plan to come back!",

    "text": "What a decadent, and marvellous way to start the week - a Monday visit to Hawksmoor, a gin-rich aperitif, some red wine, about 400g of protein and fat, an Apple Brandy as digestif, and two quick Lagavulins as nightcaps in the Commercial Tavern opposite the road ... there's nothing like looking forward to the weekend on a ... Tuesday.Meat lovers, go. Chances are you are a bloke - the waitress told us that Valentine's Day was such a nice change, with its equal guy/gal ratio, because usually it's 90% guys ... which we could ascertain after a quick glance around the (almost full) dining room.Exposed brickwork, lots of cocktail shaking behind the bar, and the ultimate carnivorous gadget - a blackboard which simply lists the pieces of meat awaiting eager diners in the kitchen ... just a list of \"800g, 800g, 850g, ...\" and so on up to a terrific 1.5kg. That's a lot of red meat. Whenever a piece is ordered, the waiter or waitress will go to the blackboard and cross off your order.The menu encourages sharing (yes, dear reader, we know you're a really exceptionally hungry specimen, incredibly so, but just hold it right there - 800g is too much, even for you, showoff). It's a form of British tapas, if you like - sharing a cow.How was the meat? The meat was terrific (we had prime rib something). How was the red wine? Fairly pricey wine list; we were in the lower third of the menu with a 37.50 bottle ... but it was a fine tipple. Some triple-cooked chips, for atmosphere.Service was attentive and cheery. One dinner companion couldn't make up his mind on the aperitif, and so he just asked the waitress to ask the bartender to choose a drink for him - anything. Turned out as a nice whisky sour. So you see, the whisky theme was consistent.Well well - feeling slightly off-peakish today, but it was worth it. Go to Hawksmoor - especially if you're a girl. You can make a visible impact.",

    "text": "Wow. Just... wow. I'm a little bit in love with The Hawksmoor now. And damn them, after serving me the yummiest steak ever, nowhere in London is really going to stand up. This really is the best steak I've ever had in London. One of the best ever. I like it here. It's utterly understated, but the staff are great. Fab barmen, who don't look at me weirdly when I explain my stupid berry allergy (but did politely check that they weren't going to accidentally kill me, which was nice). The winter punch for two was fab, all full of rhubarb gin and yum. But drinking from the same glass is fine at the bar, not so much over dinner. But they're forgiven. Because we supped up quickly, and got to ordering. Three rib-eyes, a medly of sides later and we were very happy campers. I was so happy with my steak. But I'll be honest, I'm teetering between four and five stars. Because my steak wasn't medium rare. It was more rare. My friend's was more medium than the medium rare he'd also requested. We were happy, but it wasn't what we asked for. This is just a little niggle, but if I'm paying \u00a325 for a steak, I want it cooked as I asked. But, everything else was amazing. Eye watering horseradish. I'm not a huge fan of ketchup so wasn't bothered by it. But I think ketchup should taste of ketchup, rather than a bloody Mary. Heinz would do just fine. We had no room for dessert, which says just how enormous our steaks were. But I did polish of another glass of Rioja whilst my friends drank their coffee. That was very tasty. Steak and sides for three, with wine and cocktails was \u00a3166 with service. A little more than I was planning on spending (and not something I'm going to do every week), but it was so worth the trip. Even the little niggles don't stop me from giving this place five stars. We had a wonderful evening and I left with a bit of a steak high. Yay.",

A deliciously acidic martini helped cut through a morning-after hangover and though a bottomless Bloody Mary is about the worst thing I could think of (loathe tomato juice), all the other diners raved about it. Full menu is available as well during breakfast serving hours which means the burger, only previously offered Mon-Fri, can be savoured at the weekend too. We'll be going back for that. Make sure you do ask if there is something you fancy that's off the menu as they're really accommodating. Reading other reviews here about the prices, I remembered that we got a discount (on the food) as it was the first weekend but the prices were comparable to say Roast's 2-for-1 breakfasts before 9:00 on Saturdays, but the food was better.

    "text": "I have some catching up to do. For ten years, I was vegetarian so would never even consider a steak house. Now, steak houses aren't just a treat, they're catching up on lost time. And, while my level of comparison is possibly limited, the steak itself is going to have to go a long way to beat the one served at Hawksmoor. Cooked medium-rare it was tender and full of flavour. Make no mistake, this is good quality steak. You can't question this at all. Delicious, if a little strange that my friend's medium-rare steak was a little more bloody. Still, bloody delicious though, and all washed down by a delicious rioja But I've hovered between giving this three and four for a few different small niggling reasons. Firstly, it is a lot to spend on a meal (a bill for three came to over \u00a3160 - EDIT: I accidentally said it came to \u00a3200. My memory must have been hazy because of the wine). Second, it's a very nice restaurant but it doesn't quite feel like the special event that a \u00a3200 for 3 meal you'd expect. And then there's the difference in cooking between two medium-rare steaks. Forgivable in a standard restaurant, but one that's surprising from a steak specialist. But, dammit, it's hard to give this three stars when the steak is just so delicious and the wine so nice. If it turns out I can get just as tasty steak for less elsewhere, I reserve my right to amend this review. Somehow, I'm not sure that I will.",

    "text": "I walked straight past when heading to meet my fellow steak lover. Hawksmoor has that Shoreditch vibe about it, extending as far as having no signage whatsoever on the street that I could see. The interior is dark and trendy, and a perfectly comfortable place to spend a couple of hours, but not quite as up market as you might associate with some of the prices on the menu. Once inside we got down to business. Passing on starters, we went straight into finding out if this really is one of the best places in the city to fulfill an urge for steak. I ordered the fillet steak, rare, and triple cooked chips. London is always a difficult place to know how to order steak, in some places a rare steak will come just about warm down the middle, whilst in others (Gaucho for example) it will come close to blue, with a sliver of cold meat down the middle. Hawksmoor is the latter, as my steak appeared to merely have been told where the grill was, but not really introduced. The steak arrived sat alone in the middle of the plate fat and plump - the menu said 300g but I definitely got lucky here as it appeared far bigger - with the chips served in a china cup to the side. The flavour of the steak was fantastic, left with little more than salt and pepper to get in the way of the chargrilled beefy goodness. However the big niggle I found was just how much a sauce on the side was missed. As much as I like the simple idea of letting the taste speak for itself, it could really have benefited from a nice peppercorn sauce mixing with the blood and juices seeping out that you can dip your chips in. Even one served in a pot on the side if they don't want to ruin the aesthetic of the steak taking pride of place on an empty plate. The chips were also a bit disappointing for their price (\u00a34.00), they were certainly good, but no better than any decent gastropub can muster these days. For dessert a Sticky Toffee Pudding kept my fellow diner happy, and my citrus sorbet with gin was a delicious and refreshing palate cleanser after the meal. Two steaks, two chips, two puddings and a couple of bottles of sparkling water came to around \u00a390. Very good, would definitely consider it as an alternative to Gaucho next time I'm in the mood for a pricey steak, but the sides could do with some attention.",

    "text": "If you want a fine steak in Central London, then the word on the street is that this is one of the places to try out. And it certainly should be on the list, although perhaps not the sole entrant. If you can summarise Gaucho as good steaks served in uber-glam locations, then the Hawksmoor could also be characterised as good steaks and cocktails served in a humble, almost quiet location. You can almost see Brown/Blair having made their deals here, if this was in Islington. The restaurant was surprisingly busy for a Monday night, which meant service was a little wanting, but that's understandable. Not everyone can get served like that, but it does get annoying. The main problem is the price. The most cost-efficient big steak is 600g of bone-in sirloin - which comes in at \u00a326. It's fantastically gorgeous meat cooked just right, but you're definitely paying for it. The steak I chose was succulent, delicious, and just the right side of raw. Likewise, the starter of Tamworth belly ribs was equally succulent, tender to the taste and delicious. With the exception of the macaroni'n'cheese, the fixings weren't quite as up to scratch, but eminently edible and good enough. Just not great. I wish I could report on the puddings, but I don't remember a thing about the puddings. I think salt/seasoning and alcohol overload had hit by that point. The cocktail menu was wide and varied, and I wish I'd had more time to sample some of them. All in all, a place to prepare for - don't drop in on a whim. Research your meats and cocktails, starve yourself - it's a marathon, not a sprint. And it's gorgeous delicious food. But if you want to impress a date, perhaps Gaucho's would be a better 'experience'.",

I could never persuade my friends to go, due to spendiness, nor my family since it doesn't seem posh enough for a proper blow-out. Anyway, to introduce this, my expectations were sky high. So was it the transcendental steak experience I was expecting? Yes, and as usual, no. To cut to the chase, the meat is flawless. Faultless. Best of breed. The sides are also perfect in their own little way. Best macaroni cheese I've had in London. Great chips. Good crisp to fluff ratio. Nice wine. Pricy cocktails. The big, big problem with Hawksmoor is it costs about 25% more than I think it should. You're looking at \u00a370-80 for three courses plus booze, and it's just not special enough for that kind of money. The things that keep it out of that bracket are the state of the dining room, the staff, the speed of service and the weird City / Shoreditch location. I think these guys could have nailed Gaucho to the wall, but it's just too expensive for me and mine, despite being the committed carnivores we are. Go. If someone else is picking up the tab.",

With cocktails and wine on offer from the outset, the red velvet wallpaper was soon a distant memory. The restaurant was apparently short-staffed and running completely full, an unusual occurrence which was what accounted for the significant delays. The cocktails are not what made this place such a draw on a Monday evening and that draw is related to the images drawn in pencil on paper on the walls to the ladies \u00a0it was the MEAT. Yes, it was another Qype meat-up and this time it was at the wonderful Hawksmoor restaurant which serves what has to be the finest selection of MEAT I have seen for awhile. Trusting in the chef, I ordered a prime rib steak thing of some sort of flamed level which was bliss. I'm not sure what I was eating there for awhile because I had entered a sort of meaty heaven. Each bite was a lovely melt-in-the-mouth sensation which required all your attention. My fellow Qypers were briefly forgotten in the silent bliss that followed our service. While the meat itself was great, special mention has to go to the dessert which I am not entirely sure how I managed to eat after the generous meat and healthy salmon starter. The hot fudge brownie ice cream thing with the extra hot chocolate sauce was worth the visit alone had I not eaten MEAT. Trust the chef and order a nice cut of meat. Let the chef cook it to the meat's best temperature and you will have a blissed-out evening but be warned \u00a0STARVE YOURSELF so that you can enjoy both a starter AND pudding or you'll regret it ;-)",

    "text": "The Hawksmoor is widely touted as the best place to have a steak. Naturally a venue which has garnered such praise from the meat-eating sphere is just asking for a visit from the dedicated Qype meat eaters, and so we duly set off there for a Qype Meat Up (qype.co.uk/groups/883-Qy\u2026) . And oh my, it delivered on its promise. We took our time working up to the meat with an array of cocktails, punch and starters. The cocktail menu is exhaustive and individual - I ordered a couple of ones called Hawksmoor - both very well mixed, refreshing and generous with the old alcohol. While I didn't order my own starter I managed to badger one of the boys into 'donating' a bit of pork belly. Yes, good. Out of nowhere we were then produced with a bowl of Hawksmoor summer punch - a delicious fruity and awfully dangerous concoction - one of those that tasted just like the best juice ever while drugging you slowly. And so, before long an amazing 400g rib eye steak was produced before me (and a few others - though you'll have to read on below for details of what the non-ribeye lot chowed through). I'm a rib eye girl through and through and I've not tasted anything like this before - perfectly chargrilled meat with a beautiful vein of fat running through it. This thing of beauty set me back \u00a322, and though this is over a week's food budget for me just now, oh my, it was worth it. We had a whole bunch of sides alongside the meat. My abiding memory is that they were not all that special, and though the mac n cheese is worth a mention. This may be tactical to keep the focus on the meat - it works. In the post-meat and red wine haze we ordered a variety of desserts - I have to say, again, nothing overly special. I'm not sure if this is because the memory of the steak was so close to us, or if we were a little worse for wear, but I have the feeling that they just weren't that special. Very lovely of course. Probably not worth the prices. However, as it's been pointed out below, there's next to no point mentioning the prices here. You don't come here for a cheap meal - you come here for a glorious feast. Go to the Hawksmoor and you make that choice! To accompany the meal we had a few (!) bottles of delicious Rioja between us (though I am the first to admit I know less than nothing about wine and had to be told how to check and taste it - someone else do this for me please) - and very good it was too. In summary then, it's all about the meat. I had such a fantastic time with a proper meal with all the trimmings and ceremony, hanging out with some awesome Qypers, however, will sit tight in the knowledge that I can return for just a rib eye and a glass of red wine and leave as one of the happiest girls alive. Everything else is just distraction.",

I had heard lots of good things about the Hawksmoor and was really looking forward to eating there - after having been a vegan of sorts lately, I could hardly wait to have my steak. We were given a table in a semi-private room. Maybe this was done in consideration of the other guests; we had wine on the house and perhaps they were not sure how rowdy we would become during the course of the evening ;) The evening started off with our complementary cocktails. I ordered a whiskey sour, which was a tad too sweet and there wasn't much whiskey in it (which happend to be a good thing - I was starving and a strong drink on an empty stomach would have floored me). My starter was the pig belly ribs, which were nicely seasoned. I was then served the rib eye steak, medium rare, and was treated to a great piece of meat that was perfectly done. It is obvious that the meat is carefully sourced as the quality is faultless. The side dishes were fine except for the gem salad; the dressing was not my cup of tea at all but maybe it was just me. The potato gratin, on the other hand, was to die for. The chocolate fudge sunday was very good as well and contained good-quality ice cream but it was a bit too much after all the other food so I was unable to finish it (much to the delight of a fellow Qyper). We were served a great red, which was lovely and went very well with the food. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable and when the food was served the plates were allocated to the correct diners without the serving staff having to ask around, which is quite good given that we were a table of 9.I would come back again for the great steaks but the prices keep this place from being an everyday treat.",

I mean, come on, you can't blame me for that! Oh, what big sirloin steak they've got there at Hawksmoor Bar! It was literally the biggest steak I've ever had in one go, 600 gr yes! Wooohoooo! I actually didn't want to share it with my fellow Qyper who sat next to me but I had to be polite so I offered him some because I could sense that he was still hungry even after having his rib eye. Needless to say, he loved his part of my sirloin steak but had the courtesy to say no when I offered him some more. All my life, I consider myself as a true carnivore because I must always (and I mean always) have some sort of meat in my food, apart from sweet dessert i.e. cakes etc. So, when I heard that there is a meat feast for some lucky Qypers at Hawksmoor Bar, I desperately signed on and just prayed to God that I would be on the list so that I could have a piece of those delicious steaks. My prayer was answered by MissRachelle, hahaha! She put me on the list and I was definitely in for a real treat.. Yes, my steak was big and big and big and meaty and yummy. Before my big steak, I had fresh oyster which were delicious. I wish I had ordered the scallops too because they looked super fine. Then, right after my biggy sirloin steak, I felt like I was in heaven when I delighted my senses with the best chocolate fudge pudding I have ever tasted in my life! My goodness, it was. (I'm actually speechless here, guys) That was it, a wonderful night with the best ending concluded. Well, maybe the best ending would be if Richard Gere suddenly showed up out of nowhere and offered me to go to South of France with him, but hey, you cannot have everything that you want, right? Hehehe In short, if you think you love meat and a true carnivore, seek no more! There's Hawksmoor Bar for you out there. Yes, you might have to pay a bit more, but it will be worth it. Or if you are simply curious about the heavenly experience I was talking about (see above reference), then you definitely need to go to Hawksmoor Bar and order the Chocolate Fudge Pudding! Remember it by heart, or better yet, write it down so that you won't forget :) And as for the cocktail, well, I don't drink alcohol and I just had coke with ice but based on the looks on my fellow Qypers' faces, I could tell that they were really happy. Ecstatic, if I may say so, and I believed the cocktails (and the meat of course) had something to do with it. One of them even had some sort of an almost orgasmic look on his face, but I won't tell you who that was, hahaha! Anyway, once again, if you love your meat, then you need to check out Hawksmoor Bar. Trust me!",

    "text": "Meat. Meeeeeat. The Hawksmoor is an average-sized restaurant, subdued and classy. They have a unique and varied cocktail menu (they didn't all work brilliantly for me, but it was fun trying - though at \u00a38 per cocktail you mightn't want to try too many). Great service, too, they really took care of us. Though I was part of a group here for a special Qype event. Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. You come to the Hawksmoor for meat. And it delivers that. Meat. Especially beef. There were chicken and pork and fish dishes, I think. There's a generically-labeled \"vegetarian\" dish for a tenner. There were starters, too, and I managed to slide some quite tasty oysters down my neck. But really, you come here for beef. There are four standard steaks you can get: a 300g fillet for \u00a330, a 600g bone-in sirloin for \u00a326.50, a 400g rib-eye for \u00a322 or a 400g rump steak for \u00a319.50. They also have various sizes (they'll have to tell you on the night) of prime rib, porterhouse (each at \u00a36 per 100g) and chateaubriand (at \u00a312 per 100g). And oh, sweet god, are they ever good. I shared a medium-rare sliced porterhouse with two other people. It was undoubtedly some of the best beef I've ever had: juicy, perfectly cooked, intensely flavoured, and softly textured. Charred on the outside, scarlet red in the middle, it looked as good as it tasted. Yes, it's on the pricey side. But it is soooo worth it for the occasional celebration of how a bit of roasted cowflesh can be a transcendental experience. Meeeat.",

    "text": "May the second meeting of the UYE Steak Club come to order!We decided to order large pieces of meat and share them among ourselves, because this place is glorious and you can buy meat by the weight. One group got the chateaubrianed and the other got the Bone-In Prime Rib. The waitress recommended the amount we should order per person and offered to bring it to the table cut for us ready for sharing, great service!It can get a little hectic with a large group of friends (we were 8) and deciding your meat options here. But if you have a group of people who love meat and aren't picky and have an awesome waitress like we did, then you'll be fine. Highlights of the meal for me: Bone-In Prime Rib: the meat of course, duh. Even the fatty edges were amazing. not a piece was abandoned. Greasy high five to Eamon B for shamelessly gnawing the meat off the bone. That's how it's friggin done!Georgia Mint Julip: served in traditional metal cup and a shite ton of ice. delicious and smooth and just the thing I needed to contrast the heavy meaty awesomeness in front of me. Check out their list!Triple Cooked Chips: okay so you don't go to the steak house to order the sides but seriously get these people. The triple \"cooking\" makes a huge difference. salty and crispy but soft middle. yum to the tenth degree.Sticky Toffee Pudding: there are no words. just order it for yourself and see.Con: Im a mac and cheese lova. and it was not good here but like I said, You don't go to the steak house for the sides. Stick with the spinach and chips if you need a little something something wif your meat.",

I found this in my guide book, it only suggested to have a drink there....so I did and it changed the way I will look at cocktails FOREVER. \u00a0Ended up having another, and then a bunch of \"tastes\" of things (huge long story that eventually ends at Gerry's Liquors, never mind- you had to be there.) Easily the best cocktails on the island or anywhere. Bartenders were super friendly and entertaining- who knew cocktail concocting was so deliriously entertaining. Yes, there were flames and juicings and spritses but why you are still reading this and not picking out your outfit to wear to go see for yourself, I'll never know.

    "text": "Quite easily the best roast dinner I've ever had. And I've had a few.I'd been to the Seven Dials restaurant for a fantastic steak previously, so knew we were on to a winner from the beginning, but I didn't appreciate just how good it would be. And it was great value too.\u00a317.50 for rump steak with all the trimmings. The meat had a beautiful charcoal taste and was pink and juicy. Not quite melt-in-your-mouth soft, like their other steaks, but very very good. The duck-fat roasties greeted with full-mouth murmurs of appreciation and the carrots considered to be 'fantastic' by someone who claimed to not actually like carrots.Started the day with a jug of Pimms to celebrate the long weekend and this was topped up by a really rather lovely, but yet their cheapest, Pinot Noir.A friend of ours bucked the trend and tackled the 650g ribeye steak by himself. I've never seen anyone quite so happy as he when it was put on the table. It was a beautiful piece of meat. Not cheap, mind. \u00a0What is good value is that you can get all the roast-dinner trimmings for \u00a35 (roasties, Yorkshire pud, carrots, shallots, cabbage, gravy etc) so a smaller steak with the trimmings is actually a great option on a Sunday. (sides are about \u00a34 each normally).Will be back for their Brunch next - the HKmuffin and the breakfast for two are particularly appealing!",

    "text": "Steak Club 2.0 brought 8 of us down to The Hawksmoor on a wednesday night last week, where we gnawed (litterally in the case of Eamon who picked up the bone from his bone in cut) on massive quantities of succulent MEAT. (yes that totally deserved all caps).Tisha and i shared the Bone Marrow starter, which was ok. needed more salt and the caramelized shallots were a little over powering. the MEAT itself was freaking amazing. hit all the right buttons in so many ways. the sides were alright.. the mac n cheese needed a little something but the chips were good. the bernaise sauce (which i generally consider to be a gift from the gods) was a let down. the taragon was a bit few and far between, for my liking. i normally am not a huge BBQ sauce fan, but whatever it was in the bottles that were on the table was freaking out of this world. smoked ketchup? something mouth watering, thats for sure. and then the desserts. we got the chocolate sunday, which was what it was: good. and then the sticky-toffy-pudding-omg (to be said in all on breath). hello, lover. i want to enjoy you everynight, waist line be damned. not too sweet, but just perfect.and the drinks!! yum. very drinkable. as in 'oh look its gone.' our service was good, but it felt like ou waitress was at the end of a very long day. i know we were a large-ish group, but we were very easy going. and i know upselling is the name of the game with waiting tables, but i felt like we were pushed into getting a bit more then we needed. example: i figured that 850 grams of Chateaubriand would have been enough to feed three people, who were also getting loads of sides, a starter and was planning on getting dessert. but she insisted that we would need more. granted we ate almost everything, but we didnt need to. then with the cooking temps, her attitude bugged me. i know that a rib eye is best served medium, but if yorue ok with having a little fat and tendons around medium rare is ok. and if she had just said something like that i would have been fine. but she very kurt response of 'no we dont do that,' just didnt do it for me. last word:MEAT \u00a0= amazing.drinks = awesomeside and service = hit and miss.i'll give it 4 stars, but im almost tempted to give it 3.",

    "text": "Hawksmoor is the best recommendation that i have got from Yelp till date. I love steak and am always on the look out for new good steak houses. After reading about it, I had to try this one since its so close to where i live and work ... and i completely agree with the great reviews this place has been getting.I went alone for my first visit. Besides the standard fare of rumps and fillets, Hawksmoor had special bone-in prime rib, porterhouse and chateaubriand that were priced per unit mass of the meat. I enquired about the size of the available portion and i was told that they started from 650 gm. Too much for one non-American man ... even if he is a glutton like me. I will have to come again with a bigger group, i thought, before i dug into the fillet.The next time when i came with 3 other voracious meat-eaters like me, we ordered a 850gm porterhouse (along with a fillet). The meat was lovely ... clearly the best steak i have ever had. The meat was soft, and perfectly cooked. The staff is very knowledgeable and gave us, on demand, a lot of information about each of the cuts and the best way to eat them (even the wall decorations had such trivia). We ordered a variety of side dishes and sauces. Again ... Hawksmoor makes the best chips i have ever had. Add on the bearnaise or the hollandaise sauce ... and you have every ingredient necessary for a perfect meal.Wait. Did i say every ingredient ? I must be mistaken ... for i haven't even mentioned the drinks yet. Like any good steak restaurant, it has a decent selection of accompanying wines. But it also excels in making great cocktails (at a not too outrageous price of ~\u00a38 per drink). I tried the Hawksmoor fizz, which they claim is their tribute to the famous Ramos gin fizz. Frankly, i wouldn't be able to tell the difference. The drink i was most attracted to was the Zombie (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zo\u2026) ... primarily because there was a restriction of atmost one per person. I took up the challenge. In terms of alcohol content, it surely was equivalent to at least 5-6 normal cocktails (the picture i am posting might reveal how big the drink really was). I spent the whole afternoon after drinking that sloshed, and with a splitting headache.The food is expensive ... a typical meal will set you back by about \u00a350 per person. But even then, its extremely popular and its almost impossible to get an evening reservation at short notice. Its a great place to go to for a special occasion.",

    "text": "The location of the best birthday dinner I've ever had, and trust me, that's saying something.I've been here before, and had some of the tastiest steak in existence. When my 25th came around, I realised that all I wanted to do was drink amazing red wine, eat good meat and be with my friends. So that's exactly what I did.I booked a table for 15 online about a month ago, and got a nice email confirmation in return. Though they asked me for card details to reserve the space (not unusual for such a large group), I didn't get an email in the week leading up to Friday. However, a phone without battery on my part and the opening of a new place for them (in Seven Dials, Covent Garden) resulted in a voicemail, another call and a chat with the truly lovely restaurant manager. She said that we could arrive from 6pm and have the table for the whole night.I was late (oops), but my friends were gathered at the bar happily sucking down on cocktails and gin served by the super-capable barmen. Then to the table, situated at the back, with curtains you can pull to separate yourself from the main restaurant if you so wish. A decent time spent looking at the menu resulted in us choosing various steaks. I went for the 400g fillet, whereas other friends shared the porterhouse and some went for sirloin. I think we tried pretty much every cut they had. Sides come as extra, and range from triple-cut chips to garlic mushrooms (almost, *almost* as good as the steak itself), sweet potato, spinach and greens plus more.We spent the evening eating (well, drooling over the amazing meat), chatting with our waiter and drinking fab Cotes du Rhone.It's not cheap here (\u00a360 a head for one course, an insane amount of wine and paying for me between them), but god, the meat is just stunning. I'll keep going back and back and back. Our waiter was on top form - though did pour red wine over my shoes at one stage \u00a0but leapt for soda and then told me to send them the bill - and got a 10% tip for it.Wonderful evening, finished by my boy getting the entire place to sing happy birthday to me (first time ever and made me blush). Just *go*. You'll love it if you appreciate good steak and great service.",

    "text": "Yet another review from the Qype Meat Up...! So let's start with the good points. As everyone else here has mentioned the steak is transcendentally good. I think my share of the Porterhouse was \u00a319, and many of the other steaks seemed to be around the \u00a320 price mark. Given that you'd pay \u00a310-15 for a rubbish steak in a gastro-pub, the Hawksmoor steaks are brilliant value and perfection in a beef-based format. So what about everything else? Well, I wasn't impressed. The service was almost painfully slow, and it took well over an hour in between ordering our meal and receiving our main course. The banter was good enough that I didn't feel time passing too slowly, but we then waited another hour to get our desserts. It got to the point where a couple of people around the table were beginning to wonder whether they'd make the last train home! The starters, side dishes and puddings were pretty average, and probably a bit over-priced given how ordinary they were. The cocktail range was impressive, but the actual drinks were again quite ordinary, with the alcohol often overwhelming the other flavours. I've certainly had better cocktails, and for the price Hawksmoor are charging they should be of a higher standard. I also thought the wine list was fairly expensive, although as mentioned in other reviews, we weren't paying for drinks ourselves! I'm not sure if I'd go to Hawksmoor again, but if I did I'd get a massive steak and not much else.",

I started with the scallops, served on the shell, and they were beautifully presented and just delicious. I had the fillet with mashed potato and creamed spinach. The steak was juicy and tasty, the mash potato came in a little ramekin with gravy on top and was simply divine. The creamed spinach was as good as I have ever had. The wine list was excellent, and the only thing that let the meal down was the service. I'm being mean, probably, but the guy messed around with the glasses of water, even changing them to a smaller size when he hadn't been asked to do so. He served the ice separately, and generally fussed about. Weird. Having said that, it didn't detract from a fantastic repast which I really enjoyed and I'm going back for more.",

    "text": "To all those who think \"this is the best steak ever. Period.\" are either first time steak eaters, or delusional. First off, Hawksmoor does not compare to NYC steakhouses--which are amazing ; and secondly, they certainly don't compare to the best steak house in London--which is JW at Grosvenor House. The prices are expensive, just like JW, but the quality, service and taste at Hawksmoor fall short of JW. Now it ain't all bad--the positives include great ambiance, great cocktail list and decent side dishes (although JW mash kicks Hawksmoor's mash to the curb). The cons? Well, for the same money you can go across town to JW and get better steaks, service and dessert. (Kind of a no brainier!) The worse thing I ate during my dining experience was the smoked salmon starter; it was very fishy, not sliced thin enough and the accompliments were anything but complimentary to the fish. The best thing I ate was the roasted mushroom side dish. My steak, the filet mignon, was good enough to finish--but nothing special; certainly nothing to warrant a return trip back. Bottom line: if you are looking for a real steakhouse and amazing steaks, go to JW and leave Hawksmoor to the amateurs!",

    "text": "Those bastards at Hawksmoor - they've ruined me.Could I be talking about my wallet? Perhaps - Hawksmoor is not cheap. In truth, their margins are actually reasonable, given that all of their meat is sourced from the Ginger Pig - some of the best meat you'll ever try, but you sure as hell pay for it.Do I mean my waistline? Once again, maybe - we invariably end up over-indulging here, and I think I do my daily allowance of calories in beef alone.But no, what I really mean is that Hawksmoor has utterly ruined my ability to simply enjoy a steak anywhere else. Every steak-eating experience is now simply an exercise in commenting on how \"It's alright, but it's no Hawksmoor\". This is coming from a guy who knows his beef inside out - if cows were humans then I should be in the Hague for genocide. Even when the BSE scare occurred, I simply declared \"fantastic, all the more for me, and at better prices!\" and proceeded to make as much of a dent in the European beef mountain as I could.OK, so we've established that, yes, the beef is amazing. The prices are high (but fair). The portions are vast, though you can eat somewhat lightly if you are careful.The ambience, especially since the redesign, is great - they've kept the exposed brickwork and dark wood environs, but there's a lot more space now, and a lick of paint has got it looking even fresher. Service is still top notch, be it No\u00e9l the bar manager who is a legend in his own time (always ready with a grin and some expertly devised cocktail), Tim the general manager who is always completely on top of everything and ensures the smooth running of the restaurant, or the handful of very competent wait-staff.The wine list is exceedingly well-priced with some absolute corkers on there - the wine buyers really know their stuff. Likewise, the cocktail list is a great collection of renditions of classics, plus some innovative (but not over-done) new creations courtesy of the expert bar team here.Special kudos needs to go to their sides too - sublime mac and cheese, some of the best fries in London and arguably one of the finest bearnaise sauces I've ever had the privilege of trying. If you've, miraculously, got any space left after the main course, desserts are equally delightful - the sundaes are a can't miss, but I'd advise sharing between 2 or 3 unless you have a super-human appetite.Of particular note is their (once monthly?) fixed price wine evenings they do, when the vineyard owners/wine producers pop over from various exotic locales to talk about the wines being served in vast quantities in conjunction with shedloads of beef and good lobster. All of this they usually do for \u00a350-75 for effectively an all-you-can-eat/drink night, which given the usual prices and the sheer quantity available, is one of the best deals in London in my opinion.They've also just started doing weekend brunch and Sunday lunch. I haven't tried this yet, but will definitely be giving it a go within the next month or two. All in all it's an absolute must-try. I think I've taken 50+ people here over the years that it's been open, and I think only 2 have failed to be completely bowled over, and that was only because one doesn't really eat steak, and the other got a mixed-up steak with the guy next to him who had ordered well-done.",

    "text": "OK, the meat was good. But what blew me away was the CORNFLAKE ICE-CREAM MILSHAKE. Oh my God, I though nothing could top last year's chocolate peanut butter malt milkshake in Ohio, but This Was Incredible. TRY IT. Right, back to the meat. We were there on a Sunday so it seemed rude not to go for the rump roast, although we were somewhat confused by the blackboard price as it seemed to suggest you had to pay separately for the meat and the trimmings. Our server quickly reassured us that this wasn't the case, which was a relief as I was not prepared to pay over \u00a325 for a roast dinner! The meat was excellent, as were the trimmings, though the promised bone marrow appeared to be lacking. A decent portion, but no so big that you're unable to move afterwards. The roast, a tasty (and reasonably-priced) glass of prosecco, and a cornflake ice-cream milkshake later, and I was fully set for a day of intense Boris Biking. Thanks, Hawksmoor!",

    "text": "Tender? no. Tasty? YES! \u00a0That's how I sum up my steak experience here. \u00a0At first we warned our hosts that taking beef-raised Americano's to a steak place in London was bordering \"stupid\" but they insisted....and I'm delighted they did. \u00a0The combination of great food, unique atmosphere and killer cocktails warmed the ice off my, well, cockles (wherever those are)...and aren't those a type of mollusc? \u00a0but I digress.Hawksmoor was great fun and ideal for dates and business dinners alike. \u00a0Try a conversation on the merits of beef fed vs corn fed beef for starters. \u00a0It'll be a lively one!",

    "text": "Their steaks are quite good, their sides are simple and very well executed and their wine list is small and up to the point. The service is also very good. What else do you want from a steakhouse?We tried a porterhouse and a rib-eye and they were both really good.But don't expect anything close to a good American Steakhouse. This place is good for London but wouldn't survive in New York.There are a few things though that I did not like:1. The place is quite noisy.2. The steak could have been served in a big plate rather than being squeezed in a small one.3. If you are into corn fed beef you may get disappointed. At the end though it is a matter of taste/choice. The meat served here is excellent quality as well.",
