The communal tables is another strength, they feed into the friendly atmosphere and don't feel overcrowded. The service is quick and not having to book in advance - turning up at the door and wait for a few minutes is the common practice, the restaurant doesn't take advance bookings - is very convenient.",

There are three of these Busaba babies - which i suppose makes it a chain - but there's no homogeneity here, just plenty of darn fine delicious Thai scrumptiousness, as you can read from all the previous reviews. Unique to this Russell Square branch is the great little room downstairs, which, if you can summon up 12 friends, whether for birthday times or just for the hell of it, you can hire out and take advantage of the set menu. At \u00a315 a head we had more food than we could possibly have consumed, even though the majority of the party was made up by super hungry lads. Food-wise, I am totally in love with the Thai calamari with ginger and peppercorn and the Prawn pomelo with peanut served on betal leaf - Thailand in a bite. The only thing to drink is Singha!",

Even as part of a couple I liked sitting at a communal table for the people watching potential. Service is quite good. The staff are very responsive and the food came quite quickly. The one thing that lets this place down is the food. It's not amazing and not even authentic. My partner had the Pad See Ew which came with thin noodles (like the two-minute version) rather than the broad noodles. I had the butternut squash and chicken stir-fry and the pumpkin was undercooked (and very chewy). Because of the quick service and its location I put this restaurant into the places to go before a movie or the theatre category.",

The food is so delicious, you must try the prawn pomelo, little leaves filled with a rice and prawn mixture with some mix of herbs and spices that tastes just amazing. The communal tables are a little annoying if you get stuck next to a very loud person or someone having a coughing fit, not pleasant, but otherwise the low lighting levels and amazing fragrances are enough to forgive this minor irritation. You almost feel like you are in an Ang Lee movie when you go there in the autumn and there are leaves falling outside the slatted wooded windows, incense burning and orchid floating by the big golden buddha. Great combo of lovely food and great ambience.",

I didn't hate it -- at least it wasn't the bright orange concoction you get at most Thai restaurants. it also had all the right condiments, from the crushed peanuts to the raw beansprouts. The spring rolls were something awful -- looks like they had just bought them at Sainsbury's. But the service!! Awful!! I was so harassed and looking for some comfort food and a late lunch -- the waitresses seemed more interested in making me hide my bottle of juice from plain view than taking my order. Literally! They kept coming over to tell me off about it (who tells off their customers?? a polite request will do), and when i would reply that I'd be happy to do it if they could please take my order, they would just walk away and then someone else would come to tell me off about the juice bottle, but not give a damn about taking my order. I had to wait quite. a. while. HONESTLY. Serve your customers first before asking them to do something to preserve your look. Also, I noticed that the girls across from me waited the length of time for me to be seated, served, and half done with my food before their waitress got around to giving them the bill they had asked for. Such patience - I would have left a long time ago. They also kept a poor man by the door for a very long time before they approached him to greet-and-seat. I won't be returning. I'll take my local orange-pad-thai place, because at least the service is worth it.",

Most mains hover around the \u00a310 mark.I've always been a little amazed by Busaba Eathai. Ten years after do no wrong restaurateur Alan Yau first opened the first branch on Soho's Wardour Street, the crowds still line up outside the reservation free communal tabled Thai eateries. We arrived at 7pm on a Friday night and waited 20 minutes outside before being given a menu. There were a few people who had sorted the system and nipped in to 'meet friends', there were also a couple who seemed to be treated as VIPs and managed to queue jump somehow. It's not a system I'm a big fan of personally, though the fact there was a queue throughout means that it must work for some people. We ordered finally 45 minutes after arriving. It would normally have been way too long for me to wait.We went for three mains and a side to share. The Green Curry beef was ok but the large amounts of a vaguely tasteless vegetable along with the beef felt more like filler than anything else. A grilled ribeye was thin, though well cooked and tender, and went well with the sour tamarind sauce it was served with. We both felt let down by the alleged 'crabmeat' rice, which other than a couple of rather incongruous mushy tomatoes and a lonely looking spring onion was nothing more than a bowl of plain rice. I'd have been badly let down if I'd ordered that as a main course on its own. The Thai calamari was excellent however. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Despite the shared tables it didn't feel too intrusive or loud. That being said, we were on a table with a large group and did feel like we were intruding on their party. Other comment would be that on the large communal tables the central sauces felt far too far away so that you were intrusively leaning over people to get to them.The menu seemed a little smaller than I remember. There didn't seem to be much by the way of starters, though I get that they may not be culturally appropriate. Having checked with their website I see that there aren't any desserts and while fresh fruit couldn't appropriately be served year round, there are a number of Thai desserts that would have rounded it off nicely. It was a good meal, but not worth the 45 minute wait.",

The Busaba restaurants on Wardour Street and by Bond Street are really good too, but this one just edges it for me. I've missed my pre-paid train to Manchester from Euston on a couple of occasions trying to squeeze in a quick portion of prawns on the way from the office! They're that good.",

Just make sure you don't order anything too spicey, it may blow you away slightly!The pad thai is my favourite main dish, it is around \u00a36/7 pounds but totally worth it. Go for the prawn one, or if you are a veggie the tofu one is totally good aswell. For starters have some fo the squid dishes, they are always good. And you won't get food poisoning, trust me.The decor is very chic, but I like it. The crowd in there can generally ascribe to this look too, but ignore any pretentious folk and concentrate on the food. You can eat very well for under a tenner.

They have a deposit policy throughout November and December of \u00a310 a head. A \u00a3200 deposit is ridiculous - when the menu only costs \u00a319 per head! Even my tenuous maths can see that's just stupid. The manager is the only person who will confirm the booking, and he has yet to do that, despite me calling several times to speak to him. They would have made over \u00a3500 that night from one booking. Instead, I'm spending my birthday at a restaurant that cares about its customers. That booking took five minutes over the phone. I like Busaba. I do. But their booking policy and customer service has totally put me off and I've taken two stars off them as a result. * This is my favourite Thai place in London. I've been to the Wardour Street branch but this one is much much better. It's less known so there's no queues and you usually feel like you get some privacy. The calamari is fantastic. I'd happily just munch on that. But the beef and chilli is brilliant too. I always order roti instead of rice and even that's too much much food. But the food is soooo fresh and yummy and I get very happy at the thought of coming here. I've taken friends here and they've all been Wagamama fans. They're surprised at how much nicer it is in here. It doesn't feel like fast food, it feels like a proper restuarant. It'll set you back about \u00a310-12 for a great dinner depending on how hungry you are. The juices are worth every penny - especially the lemonade with ginger Brilliant.",

The food is fairly alright as well, but not brilliant. The dishes we ordered were of a good quality but tasted quiet plain, which was fine for a quick lunch, but not in any way special. Somehow, this place lacks the traditional opulence and brilliance of authentic Thai food, characteristic of restaurants like Mango Tree. If you are in the area, it's a decent choice for a quick meal, if there is space (it often gets very busy during lunch time), especially in light of the limited number of restaurants in Bloomsbury area, but don't expect anything extraordinary.",

Sides (pad thai, jasmine rice, papaya salad, noodles etc) were plentiful and there wasn't one thing that didn't get an 'mmmmm' all round. There was loads of food for our group, though it's worth making it clear HOW vegetarian people in your party are - a lot of the non-meat dishes contained fish sauce.

We shared an assortment of starters and each of us enjoyed a different main. The waiting staff were lovely and the food was very quick to arrive. The decor of the place was also gorgeous - dimly lit and intimate. That being said, the majority of the tables are structured so that your party can be seated on a large square table with another party, so for those looking for a romantic one-on-one setting, I'd recommend requesting a table to suit this beforehand.Not the cheapest place in the city, but not the most expensive either - well worth the money!",

Now, I'm no vegetarian but if you are, Busaba Eathai has plenty of options for you. I ordered the smoked chicken noodle dish, which was delicious - especially once I added a touch of sirracha sauce! It was simple but flavorful, with Chinese broccoli and bits of egg. The prices and portion sizes are right (I'm not a fan of places that serve up massive portions, and this was perfect for me); it cost me about 10 GBP for my smoked chicken dish and a drink. I didn't try it, but the pad thai jay (a vegan/vegetarian version of pad thai) looked delicious. Speaking of drinks, a friend and I both ordered the lemongrass and ginger drink which we expected - for some reason - to be a freshly pressed beverage. It came in a bottle, and my friend expressed her surprise to the waiter. He immediately offered to exchange it for something else. We declined, but he made sure we knew the offer was genuine. It was very good service. While we were waiting for our food and drinks to arrive, the staff kept making sure our water glasses were filled without us ever having to ask, which was also a nice touch.It's not the best Thai I've ever had, but it's convenient and very tasty. I'm definitely planning a return!",

I arrived alone at about 5:50pm (just before dinner rush) and ordered the Lemongrass tea and Jungle curry. I'm used to eating spicy curry and it brought spice; unfortunately, it didn't bring much else. The curry was really soupy, without much flavour, and I almost choked on a stem. The chicken was okay, but nothing special (+1 star).The restaurant's ambiance was lovely and welcoming, with low lights, group-style tables, and lots of wood (+1 star).The service was atrocious. It got busier as more folks came in for dinner, but that meant I had to wait 25min for them to take my empty plate (luckily I brought a book). People on either side of me came, ate, and left, but they completed neglected to notice I was finished and ready to leave. I tried to flag one of the three servers zippping by, but to no avail. I then put my coat on and stood up to walk to the register to pay and only then did they notice and went to print the bill. Had their \u00a0service been prompt and courteous I most likely would have ordered dessert.There are so many other excellent Thai places in London that I do not think I will be returning to this one.",

To start/share you've got to try the Thai calamari- comes out looking like quilted 'curls' but it is delicious- as it the Chinese brocoli (lots of garlic and mushrooms thrown in, almost tastes as if it's been steamed with broth yum yum).I went for the lemongrass chicken and glass noodles in coconut soup. The chicken is quite pungent in flavour so mixes well with the delicate broth. We also ordered the chili cod (great with coconut rice) and one of the spicy beef curries (sorry I'm not plagiarising the menu very well here, the 'given' names for the dishes are a little more appetising and exotic sounding than my bastardising descriptions).Even the juices are exquisite- grapefruit mojito is memorable and even the simple lycee juice and coconut water (having had more than my fair share of coconut at this point...) is superb, if it is as simple as it sounds I might have to try this one at home.Will just quickly mention the decor is very lustrous, high ceiling and seductive all-timber interior decorated with figurative gold shrines on the mezzanine platform (this is nice- don't think chintz). Friendly staff and communal dining on square tables. It fills up quickly... here comes my commercial voice: 'arrive early to avoid disappointment'. Will be back soon for more...",

I've been in and out in less than 25 minutes before on a rushed lunch or stayed for an hour and a half for dinner - although its very ethos leans towards people getting in and out fast. Don't be too afraid of the queues - they tend to go down very quickly. And the staff are efficient, and usually always the same (I hate places with a high staff turnover...)I review on Yelp because I want to share my favourite places first - not the ones that piss me off - so you can avoid being pissed off at Busaba by doing the following:- Going for lunch or in the evening eating a little earlier than dinner time (5-6pm and you can pretty much walk in), or a little later. - Going alone at peak times (you'll always getting pulled to the front of the queue where the twosomes have to linger a while longer) - By going to the STORE STREET branch at peak times. The Wardour one at peak time is raucous! and the queue can get ridiculous! - And my final tip - if you are on a budget get the Green Curry Fried Rice. Its a one plate meal, and quite big so you dont have to order a separate curry and rice. I also order tea, because you get this cute little biscuit with it which serves as my dessert (I WAS a student back then...)I often feel like a smug Londoner when I see the queue at Wardour and walk 10 mins round the corner to Store Street where its often possible to waltz in...",

Really. \u00a0In spite of the customer service horror stories, I was totally caught off guard by the amiability of the wait staff--but perhaps this was an off day? On to the food. For starters, the Chinese broccoli with garlic and shiitake was just alright....cold and woefully underseasoned. The pad thai with prawns, dried shrimp and tofu was, by far, my fav. \u00a0There was a lightness to it as well; it felt 'healthy.' The rice noodles are different, but a welcome change from the thicker ones. After eating for the UK and continental Europe, I didn't feel like there was a lump of gloopity glop in my stomach...which seems to be a trend with heavy Thai meals. I would go back for the pad thai. With a group.",

The service was fast and it didn't take long to wait for food to arrive. The 2 choices of tea were: lemongrass tea or coconut and mango tea. The tea was actually quite nice but also different. I ordered chicken rice, have to say the sauce was so addictive and spice in the rice was properly done! The only downside was chicken pieces were not on the 'tender' end.

Both times I've had the spring rolls for starters and the chili beef with egg for the main. Obviously as it's marketed as a thali it all comes out at once.The spring rolls are pretty bad. Both times. This time they came sitting in a half inch of sweet chili sauce, which didn't make them any better. But the other two options from this list didn't appeal to me (chicken wings or chicken satay). I very much like the chili beef, which is mince and rice and similar to something I make at home, but better than mine. They put a fried egg on top, but it's cooked within an inch of its life (and clearly in a huge amount of oil). It's tasty, but there's no runny yolk or anything. So while it seems like it'd be a dry dish, there's enough juice? oil? from the mince to keep things tasty. This meal will set you back \u00a310, which is pretty decent. It's a small portion, though, and a lot of the seating is at uncomfortable communal tables.",

    "text": "Busaba is always our default place to go on date night. I love the seating there, because it feels homey and family style. I always order the Chicken Satai and the peanut sauce is always on point. When it come to mains, I love the Pad kewito (or Phat Si-Io). Basaba gives big portion sizes so I never leave here feeling hungry.Service here is also great. We always get seated relatively quickly and our food is served to us quickly too. Also a major plus that they are always coming around to refill water, which I really appreciate from any restaurant. Favorite Thai food in London!!",

    "text": "Wow! This was probably the best Thai food I've ever eaten (I've never been to Thailand). \u00a0The Thai Calamari starter was absolutely phenomenal - very tasty and tender. \u00a0The Sen chan pad thai was probably the best pad thai I've ever had. \u00a0Even the tea was great! \u00a0Service was fast and efficient. \u00a0I suppose the only negative is the communal tables, but we got seated at a private table off to the side. \u00a0There's also a private room in the basement for meetings or functions. \u00a0Highly recommended!!",

    "text": "Had a great time. I went when it wasn't busy so I was seated immediately and the food came out quickly. The food was great as always and the mandatory thai calamari lived up to expectations. The staff were really great and attentive, which is something that cannot be said for every restaurant. I used their app to pay. It was a little confusing as there are two service charges so you have to tip with that in mind. Overall it was great and I'll definitely be going back. Enjoy",

    "text": "So during my lunch break from class, one of my classmates suggested eating Thai so we came here. Walking in all the tables are \"communal\" tables or \"group\" seating meaning if you're a group of 2 you'll be seated with a bunch of strangers...that's fine. So we get seated quickly. But, I was slightly annoyed the girl next to me was taking up the WHOLE seat...oh well. Anyway we looked the menu and the server came to take drink order. I asked for ice water while my friend, she asked for hot water. After looking at the menu for a bit, we decided on what we wanted to order, but we couldn't get anyone to take our order. We flagged down a server and she said to wait for another server to come. When we got our drinks, a server gave us both ice waters but we quickly corrected him and he went off to fix our order. After we finally ordered our meals, I ordered the Tom yam talay (the mixed seafood lemongrass noodle soup) while my friend ordered the chicken curry. Our food came quickly but I was very disappointed with my food...the noodles didn't go well with the soup plus a majority of the seafood were tiny ugly looking clams. My friend seemed to enjoy her chicken curry though. All in all the food was only ok. The flavor of the soup was good...but the stuff inside the soup was NOT so good. RESULT: will I go back? Maybe...to give it one more chance...but probably not. I'll try someplace else instead.",

    "text": "I've been here twice, and I'm not going to lie, I played it safe and ordered the same thing both times: Pad Thai Jay (basically the vegetarian version of Pad Thai). As a general Pad Thai lover, it is super delicious. Everyone I've gone with tends to love their food, and the atmosphere is perfect for a small or larger group, as you sit around large tables and share with other people but have enough space to not feel crowded. The service is very good, and the wine menu has an excellent selection. This is the place to go for Thai if you're on Tottenham Court Road!",

    "text": "I loved this place years ago.several years elapseI STILL love this place.Do you like spicy? \u00a0Good. \u00a0I do, too. \u00a0You might want to start with two of my lip-warming favourites: calamari with black pepper and chilis, and a green papaya salad. \u00a0The latter might need some more detail: ribbons of green papaya combined with chilis and dried shrimp and cherry tomatoes (and, I'm guessing: fish sauce) for a marinated masterpiece. \u00a0Yep, I just called a cold salad a masterpiece. \u00a0It's just THAT good.Although I've snagged bites of crab-sauteed fried rice, broth-based soups and green curries (all good), I always go for a saut\u00e9ed noodle options. \u00a0This time round it featured tofu, shrimp and crab meat...extra-spicy. \u00a0Bad thai? \u00a0Nah, this is Pad thai.Special shout-outs go to the drink options too: muddled herbs, fresh juices, coconut water, teas...there are a wealth of options for the parched. \u00a0Communal eating at tables positioned around the restaurant, but none of the personal attention or amazing service is lost through this seating arrangement: both servers and manager popped by to ensure we were enjoying our meals, to the point where (with each one bearing a glass of water) we had 8 glasses on the table. \u00a0Hydrated Thai restaurant? \u00a0Thaidrated!Yelp note: the d\u00e9cor here is nice, but almost *too* over-designed (Gerbera daisies and tea lights floating in the entrances, incense burning in carved holders) that I find the signs indicating an entrance hard to find as it's made to artistically mimic the lines and curves of Thai script. \u00a0Combined with the flat wood doors, it can be a challenge finding the entrance / bathroom doors (helpful note: it's a bright orange font that runs north/south along the door).",

I was especially impressed by the Guava Collins - it was a very refreshing drink (pretty small size for how much it was, but maybe it's decent for London standards). The green papaya salad (Som Tum) was delicious and I also enjoyed the green curry! There was a seafood salad (not sure what the name was since I didn't see the menu) that had scallops and was pretty spicy, which I liked!",
