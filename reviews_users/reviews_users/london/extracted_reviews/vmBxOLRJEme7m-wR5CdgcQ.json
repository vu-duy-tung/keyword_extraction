I've wanted to try it for a long time but the queues were a big no-no.I assume you know where they stand price-wise, in the middle class of all the burger joints.I've tried their SmokeShack burger with chips and a Peanutbutter shake. Washed it all down with a beer.It was a pleasurable experience, the queues were short and the food was good. My burger was well cooked, albeit a bit on the small side. The chips were nice and crunchy and the shake out of this world. However, the total came to \u00a320 and for a place without table service I found it slightly high. I'll probably return - the shakes are brilliant and they make such a good match with the burgers but I won't rush into it.",

If you are in a group grab a table and wait for your food buzzer to tell you food is ready. The is a choice of three seating areas. I ended up sitting outside under the patio heaters trying to fend off one of the brave pigeons. The frozen custard is a thick mixed soft serve ice cream and it was really tasty. The burger was also very nice. I presume most people would want the double though. Don't order the single and get shocked its small. It means small! I'll be going back for more frozen custard!!",

    "text": "I visited four times and I am writing with the bias of absolutely loving Shake Shack in NYC and Philly (as an American). However, I am still feeling disappointed. The food is worth the return, but Shake Shack UK has a LOT to work out in terms of service. Not in terms of friendliness--the people working seem open and friendly and willingness. It is the organization part of service that is lacking. I am cancelling out my opening week visit, as that was chaos. (interestingly, though, with the troops called in from around the world to help, the service was a little more efficient). My other three visits have been uneven. There seems to be some fundamental miscommunication happening between the four feet between the front register and the line cooks working hard in the back. Food comes out unevenly, with people ordering and receiving right away, and the next in line waiting 15-20 minutes for their order, enough time for a companion to have finished their meal. Parts of orders are consistently forgotten or wrong. All three times I ordered concretes, they came out 20 minutes after ordering (which was nice when I ordered it with the meal, but not so great when I ordered it separately after finishing). The staff there seems to be having a nice time and are helpful in finding seats, bringing orders to table, etc., but I wish Shake Shack would focus more on the behind-the-scenes staffing issues. I am getting a bit embarrassed to bring my friends to show them a great American burger, and then consistently have crappy service. It almost feels like Shake Shack UK needs to go behind the counter of a McDonald's (PERISH THE THOUGHT) to learn about efficiencies in orders.The Smoke Stacks, Cheese fries, concretes and Brooklyn Ale will keep me coming back. But as a solo diner sneaking away for a few hours (cause it will take that long) of alone time. Sadface.",

Just heaven. I tried a bit of my friend smokeshack and it was a solid burger but it's not wow worthy! We also ordered two portions of crinkle cut chips which were lovely if a little on the small portion size and we're small asian girls, but we eat like elephants yeah? It's the world's paradoxes! Topped it off with a shake because I wasn't really feeling concrete just yet! Black and white shake is amazing! I really want one now actually.I find the seating quite haphazard, as in, it's not a service restaurant so I don't know why there are SO many servers. It's a bit too much happening. I mean, you supposed to order then pick an area you want to sit and then bring your buzzer to the table where they have two seaters who look for seats for you, that's their job I assume. And about 3 people are standing at the food collection point to give you ONE tray. They were lovely especially when there was a ketchup queue, and they would go around serving ketchup and mayo but overkill much?PPS: I'm writing this review on some shack glasses I asked very nicely for at the PR launch like way back.",

It's one of the worst hamburgers I have ever had , both times ! \u00a0First time in Dubai the bun was soggy second time I visited in London the bun or burger had a strange chemical taste. Even the fries/chips with cheese is awful but better then the hamburger. The cheese on the fries consists of some sort of cheap movie theatre type cheese. The theatre cheese is even better then this cheese. It lacks flavour and is all around artificial. Honestly I have no clue why people rate this place so highly... McDonalds has a better burger by far ! It's over priced for horrible food. If you want a burger in London go to Meat Liquor, GBK, Bryon ... There are plenty of superior choices.",

    "text": "I think this place had so much hype going for it that when I actually visited, it was a bit disappointing.We were in a pretty large group and arrived around 6pm. The line went pretty quickly with only a 5 min wait to submit my order. They were all out of the Shackmeister Ale so I opted for a London Brewery Ale, single shack burger, and then I split fries and big blend with friends. We found a large table very quickly in the courtyard and waited for our buzzers to ring. One by one we were called up, but a number of us had parts missing from our order and one of the orders was wrong. It was utter chaos at the pass and any of us that had booze had to have our trays carried to the table by a Shake Shack server. The burger was... ok. The brioche bun was nice and light and the sauce was nice, but overall the burger felt a bit oily and bland. The fries were great, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. II would go back for the fries and the milkshake (tried a friend's), but not really anything else. The concrete BigBlend ended up being a cup of ice cream rather than a milkshake (as I had originally thought) which was again, disappointing.With the issues getting our food and the underwhelming burger, I would not be too pushed to stop by again until I have exhausted all other burger places in London... and that is going to take quite some time...",

    "text": "Such a great decadent lunch if you are in Covent garden. I have been to Shake Shack a few times and it is always a sure thing. If you are going to go, make sure that you are hungry, not at the \"hangry\" stage yet as the queue is always insane and you will be waiting. It took about 25 mins to order the other day and then another 20 or so to get my food. Not exactly fast food, but so worth the wait. I had the cheese fries and the shackburger. I really wanted a custard shake, but dont think my arteries would have managed, next time! Good tip is that if you are with someone else, send them in line for a table while you wait for your food, otherwise you face ANOTHER queue whilst you have a tray of food. Or if you are like me, get takeaway, find a curb, people watch and enjoy your instant shake shack gratification.",

The chips here are quite special too, uniquely crinkled cut and crispy, can't get on board with their cheese sauce though. And finally, the only place with milkshakes better than Byron. Why? Because they have malt and because they have a special flavor every week. Yummy in my tummy.",

    "text": "Finally! It's here!After sampling a Shake in the states about 4 years ago I have yearned to repeat the experience and I got to do that on a invite only taster night.We basically sampled the whole menu in bits and pieces and boy are you guys in for a treat.Some may argue that London doesn't need another a burger joint, I beg to differ, in my eyes MeatMarkert was the only decent fast food burger, but with the arrival of Shake Shake, this changes. \u00a0Yes I would still head to all the other great burger places in London, Shake Shack is built for speed, grab a burger on the run, a higher class of McDonald's or Burger King if you will.The burgers are good, real good, don't expect the burgers to be cooked medium rare all the time, it's a fast food joint, mine had a slight tinge of pink but it didn't really matter, the flavour was awesome, angus beef at it's very best. \u00a0All three burger's are great in their own right, my personal fav was the Shake Stack, which is a deep fried portobello mushroom filled with melted cheese stacked on top of a decelious Aberdeen Angus patty with all the usual trimmings and when that big ball of deep fried goodness popped my mouth I got a rush of \u00a0mushroom and cheesy goodness, really married up with the beef patty, the crinkle cut fries were also very good, good seasoning, crispy on the outside and smooth on the inside, also get the added cheese sauce, really good, \u00a0pure comfort food. \u00a0The drinks, you can get pretty much anything, wine, beer, soft drinks and of course milkshakes, now I didn't to sample the milkshakes here but all the food bloggers and fellow foodies around me were raving about them, I on the other hand hit the booze, a ShackMeister Ale, brewed especially for Shake Shack by Brooklyn Brewery, A perfect wing man for any burger, very similar to the Brooklyn Lager with a subtle difference, very refreshing.The layout is good, sit outside in the sun, inside the restaurant or out side in the court yard, you order your food, you get a little vibrating machine (steady on girls) and you get out the way, the machine then buzzes to tell you your food is ready, you collect your food, easy as that, and should keep the ques down, and the staff are super friendly, real Amercian customer service.Any fast food fanatic should really try this, you will never be the same again, top quality food on the run. Now go get some and get me a burger whilst your at it.PS they even cater for your dog's, seriously, go check the menu ;)",

    "text": "Opting to go for the ShackMeister Sausage with crinkle cut fries, \"tangy mayo\" and a water (funnily enough I thought I'd pass on the shake) the only thing that really stood out for me was the quality of the Cumberland pork sausage that lay beneath a bed of cheese sauce and crispy Ale-marinated shallots. The sausage itself was flavoursome and tasty in a lovely soft bun which made an all together pleasant meal while the fries are not anything to brag about. I paid an extra \u00a31 for the tangy mayo which wasn't great and just tasted like burger sauce. I nabbed a taste of my partner's chocolate shake. Again, nothing special here which is pretty ironic given the name of this eatery. So sadly I'd have to agree with some of the previous reviews in that Shake Shack is not a far cry from your standard Mcdonald's type meal. This place is OK for what it is, if not slightly overpriced... Otherwise the customer service was really good- the staff were really helpful and cheerful.",

    "text": "A real disappointment. I was keen to try Shake Shack having already tried its fellow American invader, Five Guys to compare the two. I waited until 3pm for lunch in order to avoid the queues but it still took 20 minutes to place my order. The queue is a clever marketing trick to make people think that the burgers must be great but in reality it is due to them choosing a poor location where only a dozen people can be inside at one time. There is also no indoor seating which considering London's typical climate is a bit of a faux pas, in fact there is not much seating at all. One thing they did better than Five Guys was to have the buzzers that told you when your order was ready.I ordered the Shack Burger without cheese, crinkle cut fries and a coke which came to exactly \u00a310. The burger itself was of good quality but was nothing special. The bun seemed to be soaked in fat and was exceptionally greasy. The fries were the best part of the meal, probably the best crinkle cut chips I have tasted which saves this review from being 1 star.If they open another location I might try Shake Shack again but I wont be back to the Covent Garden incarnation.",

I have to say I was very excited when I found out that they served dog treats but even more ecstatic when I was told my pooch could trot on in and dine on some munchies there! So many times when i'm out and about and in need of a good ol' binge my dog has restricted me from dining in the finest of finest fast food chains. I suppose I have her to thank for my low fat diet. The crinkle cut chips are to die for! Not over saturated with hydrogenated oil and have just the right amount of crisp. You can tell they are quite healthy, if chips were ever healthy! Well hey, it is a vegetable....1 of your 5 a day. Overall great service.

    "text": "I was really disappointed with Shake Shack. I don't get the hype around it.This is London, we have so many brilliant places to get a burger. Patty & Bun immediately comes to mind but off the top of my head; Tommi's Burger Joint, Honest Burgers, Meat Liquor. Hell even Byron and GBK are better than Shake Shack. At least at all of those places you can sit down and take your time. Conversely you could, technically speaking, argue that Shack Shake is fast food so it's targeting a different customer, one who needs their food quickly and doesn't have the luxury of time. However, you'd have to kick yourself in the shin after discovering the queues at this place basically reach to the moon.The burger wasn't bad. It was small but extremely juicy. \u00a0The fries were alright, although I feel like this crinkle cut thing must just be a bad marketing gimmick, a desperate gesture to set them apart from market rivals. They weren't very crispy and the portion was pretty little. I wouldn't mind paying for a larger size but there didn't seem to be the option.Let's begin at the fact that this is not a dining experience, it's a fast food experience so these high prices are not particularly justifiable. There will be a massive queue because Londoners want to see what the hype is, Americans miss Shake Shack in the park and tourists are lost and hungry. Then let's talk about the small portions, the fact that some of the seating is outside which in the winter makes for a pretty toe tingling experience, especially when you're sipping on a cold drink and did I mention this is basically just like a McDonalds except you don't get to sit inside because the seats are going to be full.The malted chocolate milkshake was excellent though and I really can't fault them on that as it's not even something rival Five Guys can offer and it's something that is missing from a few well respected burger places in London, so hats off to SS for getting it right. Unfortunately I don't feel it makes up for the other shortcomings and wouldn't come back here unless I had nowhere else to go. Five Guys is just around the corner and Honest Burger not that much further away in Soho as well as probably at least one Byron and GBK in between. I don't see a reason to come to SS although they do sell a little bag of dog treats which I grabbed because I'm a sucker. My dog seemed to enjoy it, should I add an extra star for that?",

    "text": "So this last week seems to have turned into an unofficial and unplanned mission to find the best burger in London. Now I've always had burgers on the brain and last weeks visit to Tommi's set the bar pretty damn high, but whilst walking through Covent Garden last night, a lightbulb moment occurred when I thought \"I really must try this shake shack that everyone's talking about at the moment\"From what I hear were chaotic scenes of incredible bovine demand upon opening, last night's queues were tame in comparison although on a wind and rain swept Tuesday evening, I still had to wait at least 10 minutes just to get in the door. Once in it was rapid and easy to order, with a further 5 minute wait afterwards to collect my order. My choices were the double shake burger, regular fries (the cheese sauce just looked a little bit too funky for my liking) and a pint of the exclusively brewed for Shake Shack beer from Brooklyn brewery. Some quick points about what I thought: 1. The burger was freaking amazing - literally one of the best I've ever had. As good as In'n'Out in the States? I don't know but it sure would be fun to do a blind taste test sometime soon!2. The chips were really not to my liking at all, maybe the cheese sauce I avoided disguises them but they reminded me of the sort of McCains crinkle cut french fries my mum used to buy a sack of for \u00a31. Dry and tasteless, this was like putting a clapped out old banger next to a Ferrari.3. Brooklyn beer FTW - everything they do I love so much. This beer was a little less malty than their normal brew so went perfectly well with the burger and fries. If you like good beer don't miss out. They also seemed to do a good range of other craft beers and was nice to see Thornbridge's Jaipur making an appearance in their bottle fridge. So a fairly successful visit in the end, my only other comment is that for the most basic burger, basic fries and a pint, I found \u00a314.50 pretty steep. Maybe we're now in an era of post-fast food where places like Meat Liquor have beaten down the door and people are willing to pay more. Judging by the popularity of this branch, they're not going to have any shortage of people handing over their hard earned cash any time soon and I'll likely be one of them!",

My order was taken quickly, but the wait after was quite. But this not why I giving three stars. Maybe I was unlucky that day, I found the meat really really salty :(Sad it ruined the experience and I had better souvenir of it in my memories.. The bun is really nice, I like the brioche style. Except this, I still recommend Shake Shack for their tasty meat.Price are correct, and staff really friendly.A great moment still, which can be improved...",

Fries with fake cheese sauce, tiny hot dog! And a beer, was around \u00a314..burger was flat and just had no life or filling to it!No no no. I won't be drawn into this game.

    "text": "I came here and thought, holy smoly this Shack Stack (a Cheeseburger and a Shroom Burger together) is amazing!!! The cheese literally melts in your mouth, the mushroom is huge and super moist and juicy when you bite into it, and the burger is enough to feed you and a kid sized version of you!I made the mistake of also ordering cheesy fries and milkshake. The cheesy fries got very sickly after having a few bites, there is just too much cheese to process. The portion is as American sized as you can get. The fries are nothing worth dying for, in fact one time I came here for the burger and ordered the cajun fries from Five Guys instead. I think you could buy those McCains oven chips and it would be the same as these.Milkshake is also uninspiring. One time I ordered the Black and White (hope I got the name right) which apparently should be a mix of chocolate and vanilla but when it came it just looked and tasted like vanilla, so I was quite confused.Still, this is a burger joint, and their burger is amazing. 4* for you sir. A last note about waiting times, it does take a while which is not nice in the chilly British weather, but the burger is oh so worth it.",

    "text": "Overhyped, overpriced and over-it. Apologies in advance for the long one...I've looked forward to trying Shake Shack for weeks and as a result fell completely for the hype. Having been past Covent Garden a few times in the past few weeks, once thing has become a regular feature of the centre square. A queue at Shake Shack. So it should be good right? Wrong.The queue wasn't too bad on Tuesday evening a few weeks after opening. It only took 20 minutes or so to get to the till, and sadly things from there on went downhill. Whilst the staff are certainly pleasant enough, the management is dire. As a non-beef eater I expected ShakeShack to be willing to cater to this by replacing the Beef hotdog in their signature Shack-cago Dog meal to a pork one. I mean if McDonald's can have a completely modular menu, why can't Shake Shack be accommodating I thought. But no, it's impossible. Know this. Switching out a beef sausage for a pork one is impossible. Laughably, I was told that I could order a plain sausage in bread and add all the ingredients of the Shack-cago Dog as; get this \"Extras\" in separate containers, at at likely cost of double whatever the Shack-cago Dog costs, and I'd have to construct this myself. Such PR is just priceless and embarassing. So I decided to spare their blushes and order a Shackmeister Sausage. From the puzzled look on the managers face it appears I asked a question that had never been asked before. I can't imagine anyone has asked if their meat is Halal. I certaintly wouldn't bother. Just assume NO is the word.You're given a buzzer after ordering and service is slowww. No joke, the food here is easier to make than McDonald's, however the kitchen is inefficiently run. A sausage in bread covered in squeezy tube cheese and fried onions should not take 15 minutes or so. To make things worse, a friends meal was given to him without his shake with the promise his shake would follow. 10 minutes later, no shake. He went to get it. 10 minutes after getting up to find it, he arrived with his shake. Teething problems as a new restaurant? HOW, when they don't even customise orders in the slightest??!! A robot could make this food...Onto the food. The only things worth coming here for were the fries which were the right side of crispy and the peanut butter shake. Avoid the hot-dogs. A student cooking at 3am could produce more exciting fare. It's essentially hot-dog bread with a cumberland sausage in it topped with cheese and crispy onions if you so wish. Disappointing to the max. The shake was tasty, but far too small for the price. To be fair I heard better things about the burgers, so stick to beef if you can. Oh btw, the pork is from a rare breed of pig. Yay, that makes it alright!So essentially Byron and GBK which aren't even close to my favourite places have nothing to fear. Sure Shake Shack will get consistent football based on it's prime location but after the hype dies down, they're sure to struggle to fill those many many tables they have. No value for money, cheap overpriced rubbish non-beef options, no toppings for hotdogs, tiny portions...just save your time and money...",

Problem was that once we were done ordering we were ushered out and to a pick up window. We got takeaway as it looked like it would be difficult to get a seat and had to stand by the window in order to wait for the food which took a LONG time. And it looked like it was sitting there for a while before we actually got it, the custard was part melted and the burger could have been hotter, being more warm than anything else and a little soggy.The burger itself was alright apart from aforementioned sogginess, and the custard had a good flavour but was more soup than anything else by the time we got to it. All in all, I can't say I'd be back. At least at Five Guys you can see what's going on, and as soon as things are ready they're in a bag and ready to go!",

There were about a million people working, but all the staff members I encountered were on their A game. Everyone was nice and friendly which made my friends and I feel right at home.As for the food, I ordered a Shack Stack - a combination of their Shake burger + Shroom burger. The burger was cooked perfectly, just needed a bit of ketchup to make the taste pop. I also got a Concrete Strawberry and Banana Graham Cracker Custardy goodness (That's not the name, but maybe it should be!). Overall a delicious meal and an enjoyable time. Shake Shack at Covent Garden is huge and I think they are going to do very well at this location. It's open and airy and is right in the center of it all. Good burgers, amazing shakes, friendly staff... sounds like a winning combination to me.",

Both times the service has been horrendous and really slow, especially as I say on the second visit when we had to wait for 45 minutes. Not too impressive for a 'fast food' joint.

While the London location has both indoor and outdoor seating, both feel very cramped as Covent Garden is quite crowded. Also, the line to order is somewhat confusing as a walkway splits the line so many people accidentally cut in front of other people (at least when I was there in October).Now, on to the food. AMAZING FOOD! I actually completely forgot London had it's own Shake Shack, but boy was I happy when I came across it! I had the mushroom burger at the NYC location so I decided to go with a double cheeseburger and a side of cheese fries. Really delicious food. I'm still torn on the race between In-n-Out and Shake Shack, but it definitely blows any other fast food burger shop out of the water. I personally enjoyed the mushroom burger more, so next time I happen upon another Shake Shack that's what I'll be getting. Until then, I can only dream of when I'll be able to enjoy another Shake Shack burger!",

Hope they bring them to all their other stores. Location is great, in Covet Garden, surrounded by many other pretty shops. It's pricey as hell (6,5\u20ac for a tiny burger is just madness) but the quality is much better than all the other mainstream fast foods. Still far from top quality burgers, it places itself in between of gourmet burgers and mainstream fast food. Adding the fresh fries and slightly less greasy meat it could get 4 stars though.",

    "text": "A few months ago, this would have been a 5 star review. I love their buns. LOVE THEM. Potato rolls are so properly American. As much as I enjoy the burgers and the sauce, I get full quickly and have, many times, prioritised the bread over the meat. It's that good.I'm also a huge fan of their fries and cheese sauce. Basically, put cheese sauce on anything and I'm a pretty happy girl. They're messy and gooey and every time I think I should order the cheese sauce on the side but I never do, and enjoy every messy bite.I also think that the value is pretty good. I go with my husband and he often gets a double burger, I get a single, we share fries, and we share a drink - and it's more than we can eat for under \u00a325. For central London, this is pretty decent. I see lots of tables where everyone had their own fries and really, no one finishes them. As a proper American from the midwest, I can't deny that I'm a hot dog fanatic. Shake Shack do all-beef hot dogs, which is definitely my favourite. I happily ordered one today (with cheese sauce, natch. Whenever cheese is an option, I take it). And I excitedly took my first bite of lovely bun and tasty cheese and then - oh. Wait. This hot dog isn't actually all that great. And it's kind of small. My change of heart is all the fault of Five Guys. I must admit, they do better hot dogs. There, I said it. \u00a0I spent the entire dinner not eating much hot dog and coveting my husband's burger. (He relented, and I had a bit at the end). My advice is stick with the burgers, have some cheese sauce on anything you can, and save room for the frozen custard - it's so smooth and delicious.",

I had heard myths and fables about Shake Shack and its marvelousness, but now... now I know!I went solo, and I pigged out. \u00a0Got a single smoke shack (bacon burger with chilies, shack sauce and cheese), the cheese fries, and a single concrete jungle (marshmallow fluff, peanut butter and bananas in vanilla custard, oh holy jeez I am swine). \u00a0The burger, although well done, was clearly fresh and juicy and delicious. \u00a0The fries are crinkle cut, which usually is not great, but these were just so crispy I ate them all. \u00a0And don't get me started about the frozen custard. \u00a0Sheesh.The staff is super friendly and helpful and there are a lot of them! \u00a0Had a friendly girl keep me company while I was waiting for my food and then she kindly offered to go get my food from the window for me so as to not lose my table (although there is a plethora of seating). \u00a0They hand out menus and freebies in the queue. \u00a0I scored a bar of chocolate, myself, but there were also samples of the custard of the day floating around.Is it a trendy \"gourmet\" burger? \u00a0No. \u00a0But for what it is, it's spectacular.",

Don't be fooled, the queue is around the back where you'll zig-zag through the ropes like its the passport control at Heathrow. For such a long queue it moved pretty quickly (20 mins).Once ordered, you'll be armed with your receipt and a buzzer while you mission about for a table. You'll find tables with no chairs. Spare chairs with no tables. With all the waiters around, you'd expect someone to usher you to a table. Unfortunately they treat their own seating area like a free-for-all at a food court in a dodgy mall. So disappointing.Enough of the ordering grip...I'm there for the food!!!The ShackBurger is a no frills cheese burger with ShackSauce. Add some bacon and sweet chilli peppers and you have yourself a SmokeShack. Add the deep fried breaded portobello mushroom from a 'ShroomBurger and you've gone for the ultimate Shack Stack burger. See what the clever fellas have done here.Whichever you order, they're cooked to a perfect medium without the greasiness, retaining enough meat juices to keep it moist to the last bite. Yes, its just how I remembered it in NYC. That's why I'm there, aren't I? Try it!",

The London Shake Shack use Angus beef, and although this is a little different the the NY/ US local beef the burgers are mighty fine.Long queues are managed well with an extensive menu to keep you company whilst you salivate your way to the order queue, unless you are Alan Y and know the entire menu by heart... Then the seat hawking game begins and if you're lucky you may be able to score a table in the market hall...especially if you unintentionally push in (just trying to be more authentically American you know). The hot dogs are also great made with cumberland sausages (they certainly don't have this across the big pond).On a return venture I had to tear my temptation away from another B&W shake and opted for the peanut butter and this was no disappointment. Crinkly-cut fries are quite the same as I remember from the fair Madison Square Park days.",

I know its a new place in a very popular tourist location, but the queue at the front of the shack is at least 30-40 minutes before you have even ordered. Then around another 30 minutes until the food arrives, but thats not too bad since they give you a flashing pager device which is always entertaining and fun to bully your friends who get their order last. However if you then have to wait another 30 minutes because your milkshake didn't arrive and have to chase down service it just loses a lot of its appeal. I think if they rethink the ordering a little it would have gotten more stars, but since places like GBK and Byron actually have better milkshakes in my opinion (oreo milkshake all the way, also twice the size and cheaper). and with much much faster service I will be going there instead.",

Not that Im complaining mind you, but my weightloss goals are.4th July week saw not one but two (like, totally) burger and shake places open. Mrs K last night compared these two to McDonalds in terms of size and global market share, to which I gave her an incredulous look, so she retracted that remark, but apparently Shake Shack is pretty big over the US.I got there late (no surprises there), and got told that I'd been ordered for. Why? Because Shake Shack isnt a 'sit-down-and-have-your-order-taken' place, it's a queue-up-and-order-and then-find-a-seat kinda place, which to me, adds some credence to what Mrs K said about this being like McDonalds.The food however is a lot better than McD's which is why it gets 4 dreamy stars. I had a mushroom burger which was, and I quote, 'well f*cking nice', cheesy crinkled fries which were really good, a very creamy milkshake and also some frozen custard thing with chocolate chunks in. Later, I had indigestion and a mild heart attack.Go here!",

Nonetheless, the shack burger was an experience that set the bar for so many other disappointments....and don't even get me started on the frozen custard.(I mean really - frozen god. damn. custard. What's not to love?!)Happy to report that London's Shake Shack is just as good as the American ones, and honestly, the queue was even quicker than my NYC experience.It's amazing.

    "text": "LIke everyone, I loved shake shack in NYC and was very excited to hear it was crossing the pond. My boyfriend & I came a couple of weeks after opening, around 6 on a Friday night. We queued for maybe 15 minutes to get into the little ordering hut (surely the whole design could have been better thought out?!) - it was fairly manic in there but service was friendly and as quick as it could have been.You get a buzzer, go find a seat, and then wait for it to off, at which point you go and collect your food from the hut. I personally don't have a problem doing this, but I think when you're paying as much as you do for your food, you should probably get it brought to you.So, the burger itself tastes like a glamorous big mac...it was tasty, I think it has translated well from its transatlantic big brother, but there are better burgers in London so it hasn't ousted any of its competition. The crinkly fries were cold. I wasn't impressed by them at all and thought they were a waste of calories. My boyfriend liked his cheese fries, but you could smother anything in plastic cheese and he would love it (he's still crying that the US has cheez whizz and we don't...)Also, I ordered a large glass of wine and was given a small!!!! I was pretty annoyed by this, but couldn't be bothered looking like a big wino so didn't complain about it. I should have in hindsight. Overall, burgers are okay, but I wouldn't rush back. The only reason I might is that its quite central, and has outdoor seating, so I can go and bring my puppy with me - which is suddenly a big deciding factor on where we eat and socialise...well, at least until I can wean him off being so dependant on me!",

    "text": "Like many other Yelpers, I first visited ShakeShack in New York a few years ago. For a long time, it remained my favourite fast food burger, surpassed only by In-N-Out in California. Understandably, I was very excited to hear about them launching in the UK, but concerned about whether the quality would match up to the original in NYC.Thankfully, those concerns were unwarranted. I've made two trips to London's ShakeShack since it opened. My thoughts as follows:ShackBurger - just as good as the one I had a few years ago. The meat is very juicy (but not greasy) and the cheese melts perfectly. Make sure you get a double, and hold it in the paper wrapper - the bun will absorb lots of the juices that would otherwise escape. I've heard of people ordering triples and quadruples, and I'll probably be attempting this on my next visit.SmokeShack - a bit like the ShackBurger, but with added spice and bacon. A good choice if you like your burger a bit of fire in your burger!Fries - all of the fries are crinkle cut, light and not too greasy. A perfect compliment to the burgers.Concretes - frozen custard / ice cream desserts. These are amazing and well worth getting. Quite filling though - so probably worth sharing if you're getting a double burger and fries as well!On the drinks side, I can recommend the iced tea, or the Fifty/Fifty (mix of lemonade and iced tea) if you want something sweeter. Both are great on a hot day!I've also been pleasantly surprised by the length of the queue - so far I've had to wait 20 minutes at most (on a Friday evening and Saturday lunch time). I expected it to be far longer - but they've been able to keep it moving quickly.As a burger fan, ShakeShack is a welcome addition to the London burger scene - it's fast food (don't expect the full \"gourmet\" sit down restaurant experience here) and perfectly fills the gap between traditional fast food options and the more upmarket burger joints that have popped up in the past few years. I just hope I don't get too addicted..",

    "text": "YUM! I LOVE Shake Shack! However, I DISLIKE the giant line up of people I have to endure to get my food. The burgers are just about worth waiting in the giant line up. The staff are very efficient at keeping the line moving, so you don't feel like you're waiting forever and a day to get your food. Standard wait time, about 20 minutes before you're eating. If you want a table, in the summer at least, you need a partner to save the table while you order and collect the food. You feel like once you get in to order, you're at the end of your waiting game. But those dreams are quickly shattered when you're handed a buzzer and told to wait on the inside of the market (you can't see these people when you start lining up). They don't let you sit down at a table until you've ordered or if your partner is about to order. The food is really good, a bit pricey though, it was about \u00a325 for two people to dine. The burger is not very thick, as it is American fast food. That's where my problem with the price comes in. Unlike Byron's thick burgers, these are not very thick. I do love their burgers though. So delicious! I also love having iced tea and lemonade as an option. On every review, I have to mention I am North American for different reasons, and because of this fact, I miss proper iced tea everyday that I live in the United Kingdom. In the land of tea, I can't understand why proper iced tea is not available here (Lipton doesn't count). So, when I went to Shake Shack and saw I could get both (even a mix of both!), I was overjoyed and binged on proper iced tea and lemonade. I always leave a very satisfied customer. :)This review is making me crave Shake Shack now. That should be sufficient enough for you to go try it at least once in your lifetime.",

And yes, I want my beef with hormones and extra cruelty, please.Shake Shack's (and Five Guys') arrival heralds a new phase in the US-UK love affair in food and pop culture - all good things, to be sure. Customer service is A+ American but could be perceived as a tad excessive by locals.

So I had been really looking forward to their opening in Convent Garden last year.And they didn't disappoint. The same great, tasteful burgers as we had in NYC. The meat is so juicy and I don't want to know how much butter goes into those things, but God, I love them. I normally am no fan at all for cheese of my fries, but last time I tried it for the first time and loved it as well. No fan of shakes so can't commend on it.The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is the wait. I know Londoners almost enjoy it, but you really need to ask yourself how much of your time is worth a burger. I would seriously advice to go but try off-peak hours (though not sure how much better the wait is then).",

    "text": "The wait, the fries and the greasy, all put together for a decent, but unfulfilling experience. There are some plus points, i.e. that the SmokeShack really is a nice burger for the money, especially at \u00a36.50 for a nice bacon covered burger. However, the bun was very greasy and by the end, the burger was disintegrating and leaving grease marks on my hands despite the wax paper bag it came in. Now, I'm all for a nice greasy burger and getting my hands dirty, but when you provide a waxed bag and it still leaks through, I'm not entirely sure how to take it.Anyway, the fries are pretty darn good. They're simple, yet stand up to the damp London weather (especially if you sit outside). They still remain crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. There seems to be a coating of corn flour or something on the outside to keep them crispy I suppose. However, amongst the burger places that have begun popping up everywhere in London, I'd say the fries still don't hold a candle to those at Honest Burger. All in all a good meal, but there's very little inside seating, so be prepared to shiver a little, get a bit greasy and eat cold fries. Otherwise, if stuck in the CG area, hungry for a decent burger and not enough time to travel towards Soho, I'd say Shake Shack would be my go to place.",

And she was impressed. The food was exactly like NYC's... the bun was buttery golden, the burger juicy and fresh. I don't know what their magic ingredient is but everything tasted perfect together. We also got the ice-cream shake and cheesy fries, so we were really feeling it afterwards. But so worth the food coma... this is one of my favorite burger joints and if it wasn't for the fact that I used to go so many times in NYC, I would go back in a heartbeat.",

The cheese on it was good and I enjoyed that the pattie, tomatoes and lettuce tasted fresh. The chips are quiet delicious as well, but nothing spectacular. The shake was a bit of a disappointment. The cup was about 4/5 full and if I'm going to pay \u00a35 for a shake, I expect it to be a full shake.I'm only giving shake shack three stars because it was good but nothing spectacular.

    "text": "This ShackBurger and I have been having an affair for years. I first met this New York institution a few years ago in Madison Square Park. After waiting in a super long line, we had our first date in the park and I knew I'd found a burger I would always love, no matter where in the world I was. When I heard that the ShackBurger was coming to London, I felt we would pick up where we left off. I have now been to Shake Shack quite a few times here in London and the ShackBurger is as reliably delicious and juicy as it has always been. I am a bit picky about how I like my burgers; I prefer medium rare to bring out that meaty flavour and I don't want it covered up by too many other competing sauce flavours. For me, the ShackBurger does that well, although it is a bit soft in texture, the taste is always great. The fries here are fine, and hit the spot with the burger. I have never had a problem with long lines here though and have always been lucky to not have to wait too long. I also like their system of giving you a pager to let you know when your order is ready. I like the fun vibe at Shake Shack and the cheerful staff. I was lucky enough to be at the launch as well, and it was an epic afternoon that held a lot of promise on which it has definitely delivered.I also really enjoy the concretes here, which are a thick ice creamy guilty pleasure. I have tried a few of the chocolatey persuasion and have enjoyed all the flavours without being able to pick a favourite yet. There are so many flavours that sound good that I feel I must plan a few more trips to try some more. My burger doesn't mind the competition, no matter what else comes and goes, the ShackBurger knows it will always have a place in my heart.",

Burgers with perfectly melted cheese and creamy sauce, served on Martin's potato rolls, are a straight-up taste of home. Exactly what the doctor ordered when I'm feeling a bit homesick for my country of birth. It's true, the food at Shake Shack is on the money and it's EXACTLY like eating at a location in the states...but that's sort of my problem with this place. It is too pricy for what it is--basic burger and fries (sorry, chips) fare--no matter how perfect the crinkle fries are with their creamy cheese sauce. There are far too many places in Covent Garden (let alone London) to get a stellar/unique burger for a lesser/comparable price (Meat Market, right across the road)That being said, I will surely return here with my tail between my legs, the next time I am feeling homesick and hungry and am in the neighborhood...i will just curse my bank statement afterwards.",

Trust me, it'll be worth it\"The girl in front of us: (turns around) \"YES, seriously, I've been to this chain in New York, and it is worth the wait!\"The couple behind us in the line (heard the previous comment): \"It is really good, we tried it in New York too!\" (... then they all started chatting about New York)Now, that is a lot of hype for a burger from a chain I have never heard of, but that the rest of the queue seems to be loopy for! It became a little surreal after our 40 minute wait! Once I got to the front of the line, the server wanted to high five me! All the staff seem very enthusiastic and happy (I wonder if they will keep up this level of enthusiasm after the first day!?) Food:- I loved the Shack Stack! It has a huge juicy burger and a breaded mushroom. The bread was lovely (more bread-y than fall-apart brioche-y) They leave the roll attached at the back, so you don't end up covered in burger juice- nice. To be honest, I prefer burgers a little more on the rare side...but it was really tasty. \u00a0- I'm not sure why they call the ice-cream-like custard a \"concrete\" but whatever it is called, it was yummy and had huuuge chunks of cookies/chocolate. All in all, I'm a fan. I'll probably come back, although I might have to wait a while for the hype to die down, as I'm really not keen on long lines.",

The portabello mushroom is coated and deep fried to a lovely crisp and cheese oozes out when you bite into it.Go during weekdays for less of a line, and the staff is very friendly and courteous.

It's also housed within the beautiful Covent Garden market with some classy seating. This is a winner for me. Not my fav burger in London.

Both had cheese burgers and chips! Then at the airport on the way home got the worst macdonalds only to realise as we went round to our gate there was a shake shack... Duh!

I tried the coffee milkshake, which was amazing, as well as the Smoke Shack burger with British style bacon (not as fatty), chopped cherry pepper and special sauce. There was a bit of a mix-up with our order, so we had to flag someone down after we saw pretty much EVERY surrounding table who had ordered after us get their food before we did. They apologized and gave us some extra fries, which was nice of them! I didn't have high hopes for the crinkle-cut fries, but they were actually really good.

    "text": "Well, i'm glad i experienced that. Twice. I heard of Shake Shack for so long that when i heard of it i waited for my baby brother to come visit and we ran there. You'll notice a lot of reviews mention the big affluence at SS but i always went off hours and didn't experience it. Might be a tip for you if you don't like to queue.I opted for the double cheese burger both times and the cheesy fries. The burger is pretty and tasty, the meat is good but the most amazing thing are these fries. They're to die for, really. I'm not too much of a fries person but i'd eat the Shake Shack's anytime. The cheese sauce that goes with it is spread on the fries which makes them go soft so i advise you ask them to give it to you separately as a dip to not lose the crunchiness. I also tried to homemade lemonade and found it to my taste. They propose two sitting area, one in the Apple Market gallery which kind of counts as outdoors and an indoors area which is very small so you're unlikely to find a spot. They give you a kind of remote that goes flashing and buzzing when your food is ready. If you intend to eat on site you have time to go find a seat and wait there rather than just stand over the counter and awkwardly wait on the way of people walking through the gallery.Finally, they have toilets ! Which i thought was too good to be true. But a staircase in the indoor sitting area will lead you to it.",

A couple that was with us who also ordered ice creams & after the more than 15 minute wait were told it would be two minutes. I complained to the on-duty supervisor & asked for a refund. When I got it & was leaving, I heard a loud crash sound & saw that an employee had dropped a large milkshake which spilled all over the floor. KARMA!!!",

Yes, it costs more but of course it's worth it!The food is excellent. There's not much more to say. It does take a little while, but they make it to order. I highly recommend cheese fries, they're so addictive! Most of the seating is outside, but under a roof so it doesn't get too cold in the winter. There are a few seats inside, but the inside feels very cramped and I would rather eat outside with my coat in the winter then sit inside.",

    "text": "My thoughts on Shake Shack are: it transports me back to life in New York, and I'm willing to pay more than I otherwise would for that teleportation. It is cheaper than a return LHR - LGA \u00a0flight.Final answer.It's expensive for what it is given the plethora of burger options in the capital these days - I understand these complaints! But I also think:- the Shack bun is great;- I also have a bizarre nostalgia for crinkle cut fries even though they're not my favourite by taste alone;- the white and green Shack print - complete with burgers and fries and wine and mini ice cream cones - brings a smile to my face;- the concretes (blended frozen custard with \"stuff\"; think, fancy McFlurry) can come with pre-selected add-ins (flavourful jams, chunks of St. John's baked goods) or you can design your own. I love a small cup of custard (it's rich enough to stop at small) with a side of peanut butter sauce. Salty (ish) sauce over a sweet creamy cup of custard? YEP.In sum: I get the grumbles, UK, but Shake Shack? I'm glad you're here.Yelp note: every week there's a 'special custard' of the week. Custard calendar can be found online! Plan accordingly!",

The number of flavours available and the creamy goodness that is their shakes just add up to make the perfect shake. Their burgers are also good, just small, especially for the price you have to pay for them. I have had the ShackBurger, SmokeShake, and 'Shroom Burger, all of which were delicious. The cheesy fries are also amazing, and we keep coming back for them since my boyfriend is absolutely obsessed with them. The crinkle-cut fries themselves are the perfect combination of crispiness and potatoes. Oh, and their seasonal mango lemonade is so good! It's hard to find good, fresh lemonade made with lemons in London (mostly just that \"cloudy\" fizzy lemonade). Overall, this Shake Shack is a good reminder of New York/East Coast, and is very delicious. Just wish it were cheaper.",

However, being used to In N Out here in California, I really wasn't impressed with the food after hearing all the hype about New York's Shake Shack. My husband had the ShackMeister, a cheeseburger made with crispy ale-marinated shallots, and the cheese fries. I had the Chick'n Shack, made with crispy chicken breast with lettuce, pickles and buttermilk herb mayo. We also ordered the ShackMeister ale, which was a nice surprise since In N Out does not serve alcohol. Maybe I had hyped it up too much, but I didn't love the food at all. My bun was gooey and not fresh like In N Out, and the fries were meh, as was the cheese sauce. Nothing had that fresh taste like In N Out. I really wanted to like this place but it was the blandest meal during our trip to London. Maybe my expectations were too high. I'm sorry... :/",

We even got to overhear a little walking tour! So is definitely suggest sitting outside of weather permits. We ate pretty early, and by 12pm it was getting pretty busy and a queue was forming. I went for the shackmeister which included shack sauce and ale marinated shallots with crinkle fries and a lemonade. It was dynamite! I tried the cheese fries but I wasn't a fan. The burger was really tasty and fresh, the chips were awesome and I'd definitely go back!",

My daughter had the plain cheeseburger \u00a0and couldn't finish it. I had the pickled double burger with fries and it was really good. Limited seating, so find a seat first and send one of the group to order. They give you a pager so you know when your order is ready. Just to be up front, it's pricey, but its central London.",

I think part of my problem was that for the past 24 hours, I had been told multiple times, by multiple people that it was \"the best!\"... so when it was just kinda good, it felt a little disappointing.Don't get me wrong, it's a good burger, but the best, it is not. I took down the burger with beef, cheese and the fried portobello mushroom. The burger was nice, and the cheese was plenty but the mushroom didn't do it for me. I usually adore portobello mushroom, and though it was an interesting edition, it didn't seem to fit with the cheddar/beef combo. It wasn't anything particularly special.However, they have root beer floats, so they must be awesome and I will likely try them again. I think i'd stick to a classic cheese/bacon combo next time around.The one HUGE tip of the hat? These folks know how to work through a crowd efficiently! High fives all around to the service team.",

The first thing you notice about this place is that it is packed! When we arrived the queue was out the door but did seem to be going down quite quickly, we checked out the menu while queueing up and waited our turn to be served. After a five minute wait we were at the front and ready to place our order, I went for the smoke shack which was a smoked bacon burger with some fries. Both the burger and fries were excellent, fresh bread, crispy fries and great tasting patty, The only thing that let this place down for me was the small inside eating area. We needed to sit outside as it was so busy....after a day working outdoors a warm place to eat would have been pretty amazing. Overall this was a great burger experience but given how crazy busy this place is I think they need some outdoor heaters or a larger indoor space for people to eat. If you are looking for a takeaway burger fix this would be a perfect option!",

    "text": "I loved Shake Shack having tried it in the U.S., but I've gotta say, the U.K. branch just isn't doing it for me! The seating situation is awful, with three separate areas belonging to Shake Shack dotted around Covent Garden that are not immediately obvious or easy to identify. There have staff sort of managing these areas. I say sort of as they aren't exactly there to greet/seat you, they just seem to floating around, clearing trays form tables, telling the odd group of people where to sit. The way this restaurant works is you queue up, you order and pay, and are given a little remote buzzer that you take with you. When your order is ready, your buzzer will flash and you need to return to the collection point to collect your food, and bring it to your table (if you have been lucky enough to secure one!)Last time I was here all of the tables were full with people with people who hadn't even ordered yet and were still trying to figure out the whole process. As this area is full of tourists, most people are not automatically familiar with how the Shake Shack system works here, or where to go/what to do. It's really not an intuitive system and means that there is a lot of confusion about how to order/where you can sit/what to do. The food here is pretty good, but again not to the same standard as their American branches. \u00a0It's also about twice the price!",

Also stood at the wrong side of the place, but luckily there was a friendly guy there overlooking the seating area and explained how it worked.The entrance was on the outside of the building and there was a big queu which was not very nice as it was freezing (the reason why I was stood inside looking for the entrance). But I heard so many good things about it that I decided to wait.After a long wait I managed to put in my order: cheeseburger, cheese fries and lemonade. Because it was so cold my food already lost it's warmth by the time I sat down and it looked like someone drove over it in a big car. However, it tasted delicious. So I would advise you to go there in summer, when not in a rush, and just close your eyes when you start eating",

I was soo excited when one opened up in London. I wish there was one closer to me, like Five Guys which is expanding well in the U.K. I noticed that Shake Shack have opened another location in Leicester Sq -- why soo close?!? I love their burgers, especially the buns, however there expensive here considering their size. But I love their cheese fries and normally just pop in for the fries alone. I used to love their chocolate shakes but have recently gone off them, as my last few haven't been as thick and older ones, maybe they changed the recipe or something. Still love the place though. Lastly sometimes the location can be really busy, other times it's quiet.",

I'm informed that Shake Shack comes from across the Atlantic pond and what a brilliant trip it has made.I opted for the Shake Stack with extra bacon (no burger is complete without bacon in my eyes). The Shake Stack is a normal cheese burger topped with a 'shroom burger and it works brilliantly! The burger was medium rare - as a burger should be - and the 'shroom just made it have that additional juiciness which isn't easy to find at your standard burger joint. Also they do crinkled chips, yeah, crinklessss! Reminded me of when I was a kid and made me very happy! Another great meal in the Covent Garden area! Note: not a huge eating are so you could be outside but it's so worth it!",

    "text": "Between Shake Shack and Five Guys, Shake Shack was actually the first to arrive across the pond from America. \u00a0Unlike traditional fast food burgers which rely on cheap frozen supplies from its headquarters, Shake Shack only serves freshly cooked meat. \u00a0There is no freezer on the premises which ensures they only serves fresh meat and ingredients. \u00a0This concept is actually common among Shake Shack, Five Guys and In-N-Out Burger. \u00a0I have tried Shake Shack and Five Guys in London and I have to say that burgers in Five Guys do perform slightly better than Shake Shack. \u00a0Although I do not see much difference in the meat quality as both of them are equally as fresh, I think that the meat in Five Guys are seasoned slightly better compared to Shake Shack. \u00a0However, Shake Shack's bun is lighter and softer. \u00a0I was lucky enough to have Shake Shack in New York and again when compared to the original burgers from the East Coast, the Americans do them better. \u00a0That is why the queue there is never ending whereas the one in London is almost non-existence. \u00a0When I was in the states, I have also tried their famous milkshakes. \u00a0I love the peanut butter milkshakes when I was in New York. \u00a0Initially, when the Covent Garden branch opened, their peanut butter milkshakes were really good. \u00a0However, over the years, the quality has gone downhill. \u00a0They were either less peanut butter or they were too thick that it was hard to suck it from the straw. \u00a0Shake Shack is also extremely slow in expanding. \u00a0To date when I checked, there are only 4 Shake Shack around the country and mainly centered in London and 1 in Wales. \u00a0Five Guys have 50 branches across the country. \u00a0Perhaps their burger is not as good as their rivals and they are still trying to perfect them but surely it should no take that long. \u00a0They were the first to step into this country and now their rivals have surpassed them in expanding their business. \u00a0 \u00a0 They need to revisit their milkshakes and burger. \u00a0Whatever they are doing here, clearly the Americans who came here to train there did not train them well enough. \u00a0There is such a mass difference in taste. \u00a0They need to get back to how good the burger and shakes were initially when they started out in the states. \u00a0Probably that is why they were never able to expand as quick as Five Guys. \u00a0Do it now before you lose more customers!",

    "text": "Shake Shack is legit. It's burgers are above Five Guys, and possibly above the beloved In & Out. I realize that I just upset the majority of you, but the burger here is solid. The beef is perfectly cooked and seasoned. The bun is toasted and does its job of holding everything together. No excess sauces get in the way of this burger. I ordered the burger with fried onions in their ale sauce. Sounds a bit strange, but I liked the toppings over the plain burger that my buddy ordered. The fries are not quite at Five Guys level. They were cooked crunchy and crisp with the right amount of seasoning, but didn't have the meatiness of the perfect Five Guys fry. Overall, this place would be a go to place if there were one in SJ. When you get the opportunity to frequent one of their locations go for it! You've heard about them so go try it for yourself and see if it holds up to your favorite burger.",

    "text": "I'm not really sure why we ended up here on one of our first days in London from the US, but I haven't actually had Shake Shack before stateside either, so I guess this worked out. We got the SmokeShack burgers, which were like bacon cheeseburgers. The cool thing was that it came with English bacon which was a nice touch. The burgers were not as big as I thought they would be - they actually came out looking a little squished. However, they still tasted pretty good - the cheese was melted on very nicely and there was the right amount of sauce. We also got their fries, which were actually really good. I'm usually hesitant when I see crinkle cut fries as it reminds me of grade school cafeterias or freezer package fries, but these were actually very crispy and had a good amount of salt. They also had a blood orange lemonade, which was pretty sour but had a hint of blood orange flavor to it.There is a seating area in the middle of Covent Garden for Shake Shack customers. The workers did a good job of getting people seated, and cleaning up after people were done eating in order to gently nudge them along so that other people can sit down. We still waited in a queue for about 10 min, but we were seated before our food was ready, and a worker took our pager and went to pick up the food for us once we were seated - pretty nice service.",

When shake shack opened up in london, the nostalgic part of me wanted to give it a visit, but the long lines in covent garden was daunting. Finally there came a day on a wet october afternoon at around 3pm when the line was palatable, hopefully like their burger that i remembered.My bf opted for the smokeshack and their shack beer, but their shackbeer was out and he had to go for the meantime. I got their regular cheeseburger with salted apple frozen custard. It was around 8 quid for a burger and the burgers are tiny. Although delicious, I walked away feeling really unsatisfied. Also their pickles are not the same as the ones in NYC - way too sharp. The frozen custard was pretty much flavourless.Definitely not my go-to place for burgers in London. Wouldn't come back unless i become a gazillionaire.",

    "text": "I first saw Shake Shack on an instagram feed. I was drawn to her immediately. There was something about her demeanor that made her so irresistible. She was seductive, and she knew it. Maybe it's the way she dresses. A sliver of her buns shows through the burger wrapping, and I could almost felt how fluffy it is with my eyes. Her tomatoes has a healthy blush, giving her a pretty face too. And oh lord, the meat. The sauce glistens on her skin, and several drops slowly trickles down. She blankets her goodies with a slice of melting cheese, revealing just enough to induce me even further. Though I was only looking through photos, I noticed that I was salivating with my tongue slightly out, ready to taste her for myself. I finally agreed to meet her at Covent Garden in London. Under one of the most serene locations, I would be able to enjoy Shake Shack while admiring the architecture around us. It did not bother me that Shake Shack has been around a few times. I've seen her pictures of passion with @instafoodforreal, @bestburgers_london, and @therealJackinTheBox, and if anything, it just made me want her more. I was more bothered about how my main squeeze would feel, but I convinced myself that In-N-Out would not mind me indulging in a side chick from time to time.Shake shack and I found a seat under the roofs of the garden. First thing that I noticed was that she was high maintenance. Taking her out with her entourage of a Milkshake and a side of Cheese Fries costed close to 15 pounds. And that's only for one slice of patty. I would have had to shell out if I wanted her to show both slices. Oh, but Shake Shack was delicious. Her proportions are perfect. She was not voluptuous, nor does she try to be. She was a casual sexy, but with a touch of class. She kept it at a perfect medium rare, and made sure that you didn't forget her buns complemented the whole experience. As a kicker, she would invite the milkshake to help you wash down the whole experience. Even when I was finished, I was left wanting more.But the reality was that Shake Shack was expensive. At a cost of 15 pounds, it was unrealistic for me to commit to a relationship. I packed my bags and headed home to my true love. Though I have my share of burger escapades, In N Out will always be my true love.",

Fast forward exactly (to the week) two years and I'm transported to Covent Garden in central London. Again not fully compus mentis but this time determined to get the burger I have coveted for several years.After being let-down by the Five Guys invasion of Glasgow (I went there three times on my US visit) in terms of both quality and especially price, perhaps as I have nothing to compare against Shake Shack UK was already at an advantage. However, from when I took my first bite of the Double Smoke Shack I knew I was in burger heaven. The bun held the greasy mess of cheese, prime beef patty and perfectly cooked bacon impeccably. There wasn't a great amount of sauce on the burger but the nearby ketchup and mustard dispenser (plus tabasco) let me sauce it right up. I didn't come across one piece of gristle which was very welcome.Even the crinkly fries which I thought didn't looked great (you can buy the same brand in Costco for around \u00a33 for 2.5kg... the profit margin on these must be incredible) were actually super crispy and well smothered in tasty tasty cheese sauce.You do pay for the pleasure however, my bill was almost \u00a315 just for one burger and one portion of fries. Will I be back? Most definitely.",

I was surprised to learn this New York establishment opened locations in England..before the West Coast. No bother, though. We were excited to have a bite of our favorite East Coast burgers.Despite the masses of people, the location seemed a bit inconspicuous and it was hard to tell were the queues started and ended from the way it is set up. Nearly all Shake Shacks I've been to (stateside at least) always have crowds; this one is no different. That of course is to be expected for a place as busy as Covent Garden. It's so busy, though, that there is even a separate queue for the designated seating areas. Go with someone, so one of you can stand in the food queue and the other can wait for a proper seat inside. Otherwise, you may be stuck on the outer edges having to fight off pigeons scavenging the adjacent leftover trays as we did! Once the food was finally ready and we dug in, I realized that this was not the same food I'd salivated over before. My burger patty was slightly dry, definitely not the level of juicy goodness familiar to many Shack Stack lovers. I didn't think I would have to give any Shake Shack less than four stars (since my first visit in Vegas), but a few things could have been improved. 3.5 on the food and experience.",

I ordered the Shroom burger which is THE BOMB, its: crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato, ShackSauce. And of course I had to add cheese fries and top it up with a beer. My sister ordered the Smoke Shack: Cheeseburger topped with all-natural applewood smoked bacon, chopped cherry pepper, ShackSauce. We don't recommend this one; it was a so so burger. The staff here is very helpful and they carried our order from the counter to our table outside when we handed in our beeper thing. I would definitely recommend this place for burger lovers.",

    "text": "Since Shake Shack arrived in London, I read very mixed reviews. In the first weeks, there were always enormous queues, so I never dared to try it. Located right in the centre of Covent Garden, you can get there easily, but you should be prepared to wait at least a few minutes. The interior looks okay, but it feels a bit like a fast food chain, everything looks a bit cheap. I did not like, that I have to wait for my food and then pick it up myself at the counter \u00a0there are so many staff running around, why can they not bring me my food? I guess this is part of the concept, but I found it a bit weird and annoying. I ordered the SmokeShack\u2122 burger and it was a decent burger. Nothing really special, but there was also nothing wrong with it. Actually, given its size, it is perhaps more a decent slider than a burger. The size also has a good side, because it makes the burger easy to eat, avoiding a big fatty mess. I also went for the crinkle cut cheese fries and they were probably the highlight of my dinner. Nice crispy fries with cheddar cheese on top \u00a0I added some small bags of pepper to make it even more enjoyable. I find it a little bit difficult to rate this place. While my burger was a solid piece of food and the crinkle cut cheese fries were a little bit special, it did not feel like a place I like to visit more often. Let alone a trademarked burger name on the menu, that is not even a registered trademark yet (get it, this is Europe, your strange sign does not mean too much over here, and your burger name is probably also protected without it). At the end, I found this place overhyped and overpriced for what it is. Maybe I was expecting too much \u00a0if I had the choice between Shake Shack and some of the other burger joints in central London, I think I would prefer one of other options. Not so much for the food, but mostly for the atmosphere. That said, I definitely have to go back to check out the desserts and shakes",

I got the ShackBurger with amazing shack sauce with really great crinkle cut fries and a Big Blend Concrete. I was full so I'm needlessly complaining that the burger was perhaps a little small. However my stomach seems to be pretty tiny compared to other people, so maybe portions could be slightly larger. The concrete was great, although isn't this just (delicious) ice cream? I love the fact they have dog biscuits. If they're anywhere near as good as the human food our canine brethren will be in for a treat.",

My only gripe was that didnt give salad etc in my burger, which i thought would come as standard but it seems youve gotta ask for it!On pricing, a little more expenise for what it is. All the burgers cost around 8.75 then you gotta add fries on top so pretty costly. Id recommend the cheesy chips and a single classic burger to keep costs to under \u00a310",

    "text": "Shake Shack were running a lottery yesterday. If you got buzzer 137, you won warm ice cream, cold fries and burgers with an interesting layer of grease after about 20 minutes.Buzzers fail - that's a fact of life I guess, but what followed is how they earned this review.Clearly they have a lot of people paying \u00a325 quid for food and then wandering off because at no point did they think to send a staff member (of which they have dozens lurking to make sure you vacate your seat as soon as possible after taking your last bite) round their seating areas to call for the buzzer number or the name clearly printed on the receipt. What's the point of taking the name if you're not going to use it when your tech fails ? The meal in its various stages of warming, melting and oozing went back and we tried again. A little while later the duty supervisor handed me a tray, gave me a big smile and told me that she hoped I enjoyed my meal. I would have, if it had all been there. So we tried again. But this time she left me standing in the crowd being jostled by every other visitor to Covent Garden on the hottest day of 2013 holding my tray while I watched the ice cream melt. Again.The fries were brilliant in the end, but the shakes were rushed so they were more solid ice cream than anything else and the burgers have a long way to go before they get to Five Guys quality.But hey, if you get buzzer 137, you won't have to worry about the quality of the food because you won't get near it unless you don your Indiana Jones hat and go exploring.Authors note - there was at least 1 other faulty buzzer while we were there. I don't know what they won though.",

Luckily, it goes rather quickly, even at the busy times despite the daunting length - a far cry to the Shake Shack location at Madison Square Garden, which took forever to move. Thank (whatever god you believe in) its closed!And just like the NYC's locations, the burgers were tasty and good, and a bit sloppy too. Regardless, the ground beef tastes the same, the toppings too, and chips were about the same as well - wow, its almost like McDonald's, as in consistency.Treats are also available here if you have wolfie along with you.I've ordered takeaway, and was provided a good container to haul the food - did me fine when going home with it, though the other transport patron probably didn't appreciate it, I'm sure, hee hee.Will come back for more!",

Dave A. went with me and he loved it for this exact reason, his Australian food request is always a Bacon Deluxe burger from Hungry Jacks, which no one has quite figured out to put into a care package just yet.The biggest disappointment for me was the sauce. If you name a sauce after your brand I want it to really stand out, but I didn't even really notice it was there...Other than the burger I got a peanut butter shake and we split a serve of the fries. I probably wouldn't recommend the peanut butter flavour, but the shake itself was awesome. So thick I could barely get it up the straw, my kind of shake. The serving of fries is pretty small so if you're hungry, go for one each.",

    "text": "I'd love to know what the big deal is about Shake Shack. I get the feeling it's a nostalgia thing for the Yelpers from America. Perhaps it feels like a little slice of home in their new home.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my burger, but I was not wowed by it.Let's start with the location. They're right in the middle of Covent Garden Market. There's outdoor seating within the market building and an indoors area (which I totally missed until I was already seated outside because it's not in the same room as the counters. Tables seemed to be mostly created for groups of four, but despite no real queues, we struggled to find a table because all tables were taken by couples. In the middle of Winter I'm disappointed that they have no heaters in the outdoor area. It was really cold and by the end of eating my burger my fingers were purple.The ordering/serving system doesn't really make sense to me. You order and pay at the counter. The staff who served me was really nice. It was a nice surprise to be asked how I was. I'm used to just asking for my order. After ordering you are handed a buzzer/bleeper with your receipt and head to find a table. When the buzzer goes off you go back to the serving hatch by the counter to collect your food. Why so complicated?I guess the important thing is the food. I'd be warned about the small burgers so order the Shack Stack - a beef patty, breaded portobello mushroom, lettuce, tomato. It was really nice, the mushroom really made the burger. My friends stuck with more classic cheese burgers and both seemed a bit disappointed by not only how small it was, but how thin it was too. The chips were awesome. Really crispy. I'd go back just for them to be honest. Perhaps the problem with Shake Shack is the price. It's got the set up of a McDonalds, but with the prices of Byron and the other premium joints. For this reason I'd rather go to one of the MeatLiquer or Byron restaurants next time, unless I return for the chips and to try the custard.",

I've had many long conversations with college friends while eating Shake Shack in the park and people-watching. Bit harder to do that here, but one thing that I really appreciate about London Shake Shack is that, unlike some American imports (looking at you Chipotle), it tastes EXACTLY the same as back home. Objectively, this isn't the best burger in London by any means. But it is, and always will be, comfort food. It bugs me though that the \"cost\" is the same until you see the \u00a3 and not the $ :(",

    "text": "After opening five months ago, I finally rolled up into Shake Shack to give them a try. I'm always curious, and being from the west coast in the US, this was my first opportunity to give them a try. But I'm not going to queue for ages for a burger. Not going to happen. Sorry. Luckily in December the queue is down to a minimum. There were things I really liked about Shake Shack. First the fries are pretty awesome. Super crispy fries. The cheese sauce is like you'd expect it to be for an American franchise: oozy, warm and orange. They even have unsweetened ice tea. It's like being back home.There were things that were nice, but not amazing. The concrete was nice. I think mine had about four fillings. It was nice, with the best part probably being the biscuits and the peanut butter. But it wasn't any better than some of the Gelato and Ice Cream places around London.And finally there were bad things. The burger. It was kind of boring to be honest. I went with the Shake Stack (because I love mushrooms on my burger) and opted to add bacon and the chopped pepper from the Smoke Stack. I figured this was likely to be my only trip here and I might as well go for it. Nothing was really great for me. I mean it was an adequate burger, but I don't want adequate burgers. I want something awesome. Especially when my total was over \u00a320. Yup. For a fast food burger, fries, drink and a dessert, it was over \u00a320. There is no way I can justify spending that much money on fast food ever again. Especially when it wasn't amazing. Oh and the outdoor seating. There were heat lamps, but they weren't doing anything. And it's December and cold. Not cool Shake Shack.There are better fast food burgers quite close by, and if you could mix those with the fries from Shake Shack, I think I'd be in heaven. At least for fast food. Although again, most of the food trucks around London do a better job with burgers. I really can't imagine ever going back here.",

BUT I think this trend is a little conveeeniant for those (dare I say it!) lazzyy chefs and restaurants out there. Maybe I'm being cynical. Either way, although the meat for the burger was clearly good meat, it was greasy and didn't leave me feeling fantastic.

    "text": "So much hype!Boy was I disappointed with this place. People have been raving about this place for quite some time, so I figured that I owed myself a trip here to see what it is all about.Opting to come here a little later on in the evening, to therefore escape the unfeasibly large queues, I only had to wait for around 20 min to place my order. What a luxury!After placing my order, I milled around the pickup window and waited for my food and drink. After another really long wait (bearing in mind that it was a very atypically quiet time for Shake Shack) I was presented with my order.Firstly, the claims of the holy grail of milkshakes was unfounded. My friend's shakes that I tried and also my own that I ordered were all nice enough but in no way did they justify the astronomical price tag. The fries were merely average (they tasted like \u00a0something you get in the frozen section of the grocery store) and the burger was indeed pretty good, but far from the best I have ever tasted.I suppose that many of these things are very subjective. However, I went to this place with a very open mind and was really hoping and I daresay excited at the prospect of something new and compelling to experience in London. In short I have had better burgers many times in my life, I have most definitely had better fries and/or chips and most importantly (if you are going to name your business after them) I have had way better milkshakes in my time. And all of these have been far cheaper than the prices Shake Shack charge. Some of my American friends have told me that they pretty much took the dollar price and changed it to a \u00a3. If this is true, the review would be far more positive in line with value for money, and indeed why am I being prejudiced against that I am paying 50% more for my food just because I am British?",

So it's a 2 star review for the stress, remove it and it would get a 4 star review. \u00a0For now, I would say go to Meat Market, Five Guys or Byron instead. \u00a0Any of them would give a better all in lunch experience regardless of the burger differences and all of them sell good burgers.",

The house lager is really nice and has a more ale taste, perfect. Here's what stops me from saying I outright love it:- The location. - The price.- The competition.Covent Garden is just too busy and too touristy to allow you to really enjoy eating the food here. The seating is almost always full so you tend to end up sat on odd tables that have been pushed aside by larger groups of people. It's a bit like eating in a packed McDonalds at lunch time in terms of atmosphere.This brings me on to the price! Two burgers, two drinks and a portion of fries will set you back around \u00a330!!! That's just insane, even for London prices.Looking at the receipt for \u00a330 you start to think you could have gone to one of many competing US imported burgers chains (for example Five Guys which are opening up everyone in London atm), enjoyed a very similar quality product for a fraction of the price in a much nicer atmosphere.",

    "text": "'Love shack, babyeeee' When this shack's a-rockin, don't come a-knockin. Basically don't interrupt me when I'm eating. Heading to an event last night in Covent Garden, there was really only one thing on my mind... 'how quickly can I shake these guys off and get my Shack on'. I was a Shack virgin, you see. No one likes a Shack virgin. When we arrived, we were pretty lucky that there was no queuing. I popped right up and ordered a shack burger and cheese fries. I strong-armed Alex into buying us a frozen custard with the flavour of the month caramel and chocolate. The server didn't have the best English so it was a bit of a struggle to order. I love the fact that the bouncers do a little Shake Shack song when they hand over the food. For my first bite, I was excited and it was so so worth it. A gorgeous burger, my only complaint, too small. A double for sure next time, more meat in my mouth! Or maybe the Shake Shack Stack, I had a taste and that was gooood. The fries were a bit lacklustre, I could have done with more cheese and more cheese. Maybe some more cheese. But I dig that they have ketchup, mayo and mustard, I love a range of condiments. And the frozen custard, well I was about ready to ask it to marry me. Not icecream, not frozen yoghurt, but some beautiful new marriage of flavours. Better than In n Out and Five Guys. Soz, fellas.",

    "text": "So underwhelmed. Shake Shack in NYC is a must for me every time I'm there. There are many reasons for that. Unfortunately, most of those reasons do not apply for their new London branch.Two stars go completely for the Peanut Butter shake. Pure awesomeness and delicious in every way. This is where the likeness to their staple NYC branches stop.It cost \u00a316 for a double burger, fries and shake. Wow, that hurt. My burger came really under-cooked. When I showed the manager, he instantly snapped back at me saying, 'We cook them for 30 seconds on each side, that's how it's supposed to be.' No sir, burgers should not ever be prepared where they are still raw...unless you're at a raw food place. Also, not really a great introduction when you challenge the customer and tell them they are wrong.The hype is just not deserved. I didn't mind waiting in line, I did it for the Five Guys launch as well. The difference is that the experience and food at Shake Shack just wasn't there. That and the price are likely to keep me steered towards going to Five Guys instead.",

    "text": "I first hit Shake Shack on their opening day but I've held off writing a review until I could revisit for a more typical experience. Opening day was awesome with almost as many staff as customers (and since the seating area was full and there was a line - there were just a ton of staff). Everyone was smiling and welcoming, a number of the staff (both local Londoners and experienced NYC staff brought in as trainers) stopped by for a chat, and even Danny Meyer was making the rounds to talk to as many people as possible. What struck me is that some of the staff I talked to at the opening remembered me when I came back three weeks later - bonus points on customer service!My two favourites are the SmokeShack (a smokey bacon double cheeseburger) and the Shake Stack (a cheeseburger with a deep fried portabello mushroom). The SmokeShack is garnished with cherry peppers and is a pretty solid burger. Two patties covered in cheese and topped with bacon is everything you could hope for in a fast food burger and the spiciness of the cherry peppers gives you a nice warming feel. This isn't an amazing burger - I won't be waxing lyrical on the blend of meats or the softness of the bun - but it's exactly what you want. I'd say think of a middle ground between McD's and Lucky Chip.The Shack Stack is actually my favourite with the meaty portabello mushroom being even beefier than the patty and giving a great breadth of flavours. The one thing it was missing was that bit of heat the SmokeShack can boast. So an easily solution - get them to add it on, something the staff are happy to do. Next, take a look at the custards and concretes. I know some friends love the strawberry shortbread custard (and it is pretty good), but the concretes are the key to my heart. While one has been kept from the US menu, the rest are new designs using local bakeries - in particular St. John's. The Big Blend and the Sticky Toffee concrete are excellent which creamy ice cream, brown sugar biscuit bits, and rich chunks of decadent chocolate brownies all mixed in. You can opt for singles or doubles and I'd strongly suggest the double for two reasons: 1) people are going to want a taste and 2) the single is just not enough to satisfy the craving.Shake Shack sells a range of wine and beer including their own bespoke Shackmeister Ale. However, I've always opted for a concrete so I really couldn't comment - I do want to try that ale so maybe I'll push for it next time.",

    "text": "Went at 1345 on a Friday. Wait was around 40 mins but I decidedly arrived at the tail end of their lunch peak because the queue only got shorter after me. Arriving before 1230 or after 1430 is probably safe if you don't want to rough it out.I thought it was fairly close to the NY one but just a tiny bit inferior. Then again, I may just be romanticising the nyc one - the grass being always greener and all that.Burger:Patty was as it should be. Flavourful, tender, no complaints. It is of course somewhat small but that's kind of shake shack's thing.Fries:Fries are as average as they are in the states. I only ever get the cheese fries if I get fries, and I only get fries if I'm craving them. Not worth going out of your way for.Drinks:Wanted a root beer float but apparently they were out of rootbeer. Bit annoying. Had a peanut butter milkshake instead. It was too thick for my liking. That's not necesarrily a bad thing, merely a preference. So thick milkshakes basically.Overall:I actually love love love shake shack. I loved it in the states,and I love it here. If you haven't been, ignore the haters and give it a go. For any burger love this is simply one of those that you have to try yourself regardless. I have no doubt I'll be patronising them frequently.Notes:Annoyingly expensive - I was hoping they'd price similar to nyc but they seem to have taken the same prices and just slapped a pound sign in front making everything around 1.5* more expensive. They also seem to have a weird amount of staff. Obviously creating employment is great so it's all well and good but just weird that they have like 20 people milling about doing nothing.",

    "text": "In a nutshell: a lot of swing but not that great a punch. Apparently Shake Shack is one of the most successful, popular and applauded burger chains in the US which explains all the hype about its arrival to London. After all, this is the country that also gave us McDonalds and Burger King and I sure as hell think those are brilliant ideas in their own right. (There might be some sarcasm in the above sentence, but I will leave that open to interpretation)Here's the thing: you can't really call yourself a \"fast food\" chain and then take 40 minutes to serve your clients. I mean, there's nothing wrong with taking 40 minutes to serve your clients if you are cooking something on the spot. Like a duck. That just got captured. Bistro-style dish in Marsala jus.But then you should drop the \"fast\" from the \"fast food\" concept and just go with \"food\" when you are positioning your brand. \"Food\" on its own sounds weird though... I suggest \"Good Food\" in lack of a better idea.Oh and it also doesn't help that a meal (with a milkshake included) costs 3 times more than your normal \"fast food\" meal. You see... time and price go hand in hand when it comes to FF (I am just gonna type FF for Fast Food cause the expression is getting on my nerves...)Still with me? Here's where it gets even trickier: the burger was actually nice. Well cooked, flavorful, good amount of salad... But it was small!!! Heaps small for the price! And they brought my milkshake in the wrong flavor (vanilla instead of strawberry) - it's alright, I can forgive the confusion. What I can't forgive is that the milkshake was thick to the point that I doubt it was blended for more than 2 seconds. [Insert sad face here]. Even for FF standards, this is disappointing. The crinkled fries are absolutely great. Loved them. It's like they perfectly cut them to bite size bits. For that and because the burger had a nice flavor to it I am giving it a 3 rather than dropping it straight to the lower league.One thing is for sure: on any given Sunday and for this price range I would definitely recommend Byron instead. The gap between the two is just too big to compare.",

The downside - the price is a little steep - they have converted the USD pricing to GBP - ie making it about 1.5 times more expensive than in the US, but I would not go back until I really need the urge for a burger as I have been once too many times I think :) Happy eating :)",

Since then there's been a slow decline in the quality of the food here, now it's a fancier version of McDonalds.

    "text": "Having recently reviewed the \"small group of blokes\" burger offering around the corner thought it only fair that I do the same for Shake Shack.First thing to note is despite the very central location in Covent Garden this place doesn't scream out \"HERE WE ARE!\" I'm wondering if that was a stipulation on taking the lease or if that's a Shake Shack thing but have to say for an American burger chain its refreshing.Just outside the main door a Shack employee handed me a menu despite there being a huge one plastered all over the back wall..... go figure!First thing to note was the complete lack of a plain burger option it was all variations on a cheese burgers or \"burger off\" so to speak. I guess you could have ordered your burger without cheese but I doubt they'd have adjusted the price accordingly.... odd really.While in line waiting to order it was impossible not to notice the huge number of employees behind the counter. A quick count came to over 20. I doubt the actual figure was under 25!! What the hell is this a Government led employment scheme??? Decided to go for a single patty cheese burger at \u00a34.75 as the double for \u00a37.75 was like \u00a37.75.... are you serious????? As usual I had the \"mayonnaise\" left out as as I've previously said I hate slop. Ended up getting the mandatory do you want fries?, do you want a drink? etc etc which was No, No and No! Got handed a cool beepy, buzzy thingy to alert me as to when my order was ready. Again as with the competition around the corner you couldn't describe this as fast food despite the number of employees the wait was in the minutes rather than the sub-minute you'd expect at McD's. I'll give Shake Shack its due its one of the visually prettiest burgers I've seen for quite some time (see my uploaded photo) unfortunately I was also taken by its rather demure size considering its just 5 pence short of 5 quid!The bread? in the bun comes from the 'Wonder Bread' school of bakery rather than anything a baker would recognise as bread. My kingdom, my kingdom for a burger on a real bread bun! Picking the burger up I noticed that the bun was hinged and not 2 separate pieces i.e. a top and bottom which led to the observation that the filling only covered the front 2/3rds of the burger. Think your average supermarket sandwich thats super stuffed with filling on the side you can see but on purchase you see that the bit you can't is filling free. One of my pet hates with any food is widely varying temperatures. Yet again a supposedly premium American burger chain is selling its burgers with hot meat and fridge cold tomato, lettuce etc. If McD's can get this right when selling a burger at a 3rd the price it fails me my Shake Shack and others can't.Overall the actual items in the burger (temperature excepted) were quite good. The tomato was ripe and the pickles nicely sharp and crunchy but as mentioned above I'd have preferred them to have covered the entire burger.The Shake Shack literature says that burgers are cooked medium unless asked otherwise. I didn't say anything but wonder if I got medium? (see my attached photo) The beef is 100% Aberdeen Angus but didn't specifically note the meat being anything special if anything it had quite a mushy if I was being nice or \"pre-chewed\" if I wasn't texture. The bottom of the burger was completely sodden and my fingers felt quite fatty after finishing the burger.Overall given the choice I'd choose Shake Shake over its rival around the corner but thats not to say that Its a great burger.",

    "text": "After going to Shake Shack in NY 6 months ago I had been craving a great burger since moving to London.. to my delight I head the news of Shake Shack opening in Covent Garden and just had to go! Being the third day open I expected a huge queue, but due to the efficient staff I was at the front of the line within minutes and not long after holding the perfectly sculpted 'shroom' burger & equally delicious toffee flavored 'concrete' shake. Both were amazing which is slightly sad because now it's going to take a lot of will power to not go here everyday for this breathtaking experience!",

    "text": "Shake Shack or Five Guys? How do you pick your favorite child?In a nutshell, this location is about as perfect as can be. There are employees everywhere to keep the whole process from order to departure running smooth. The line system is well set up, and while I didn't like the snippy cashier who refused to let us order medium rare (easy at SS in the states) it's all-in-all a breeze.If you've never been, it doesn't get much better than a ShackBurger, fries and a Fair Shake. The latter being the greatest coffee shake on the planet. Hell, the greatest shake PERIOD. The fries at this location were also bringing their A-game; I've had a variety of fry conditions at other shacks, from burnt to soggy, but these were crispy and delicious.But what's with everyone putting so much damn mayo on their burgers? There's a pile of mayo dipping cups in the seating area, and practically every table had crazed hooligans ladling it on by the knife-full with each bite.The Shack sauce is all you need, friends.",

    "text": "I came here with my husband who was craving a burger. He thought it was decent, but, I don't know. What you got for the price was absolutely ridiculous. Now onto the review from a non-meat eater's perspective. I am a pescetarian who hates, ABHORS mushrooms, and I know of several others (including vegetarians) who feel the same. The only vegetarian option Shake Shack offers is the shroom burger, though, apparently because (according to a Buzzfeed article) that was the only thing they could come up that people would actually crave. It's a bit of a shame because I have had several delicious veggie burgers (mainly from USA) and think that people do crave other vegetarian ingredients!So I just had their chips. They're yummy, but they taste like they're good quality chips you can find in the frozen food aisle, not freshly, hand-cut and deep fried like proper fries/chips!Two stars for the OK chips and my husband's word that the burger was ok.",

    "text": "Was it worth the 40 minute wait on the 4th day after opening? YES. So much yes.The staff (every one of them!) are so friendly and wonderful, but not in that obnoxious way. You really don't feel like you're eating fast food with the great customer service in the way they take your order and wipe down your table if you are eating in.I got the blackberry buttermilk custard (that day's special!) and the shack stack. BEST DECISION EVER. Definitely try the custard! It's thick, creamy, but not overwhelmingly heavy. Shack stack was also spectacular.One small thumbs down is the fact that they messed up my burger and got me a regular shack burger. I went up to the counter to get my correct order and they did apologize, but it took a long time for them to put the mushroom inside, and while I waited, the custard just sat on the counter getting slightly melted.I'm from the States, but only the East Coast has them. Now I wish the West Coast did too...London, I'll be back soon, and I will get Shake Shack again!",

I was shooing away a footless winged beast my entire meal. I couldn't relax and as much as I wanted to enjoy my meal, all I could think about is when I could get outta that coup.Without the pigeons, would return but until an aggressive birth control/death policy is in place, you won't find me at Shake Shack London.",

    "text": "Ah, yet another high profile New York import. It isn't as good as the original (obviously) but it really ain't half bad!Popped by a little past opening time (11am) on a Saturday being the over-eager azns we are and poof, no queue! Fair enough, I'm like a whole month late on this but still, on Saturday at a massive tourist hot spot, *AMAZING*. Service was quick, friendly, and we went off to sit on their surprisingly nice ikea garden chairs (of the T\u00c4RN\u00d6 variety).My favourite shroom burger is still a winner! The first time I had it (at Union Square) I didn't even realise it was vegetarian - that's how good it is! And it pretty much tastes the same here (massive thumbs up). 'Melted cheese' is hardly an accurate description. This cheese is warm and gooey and stretches as you try to pull the burger away from your mouth but the best bit (!!!!) is how good it tastes. Seriously. I don't know what they season it with but it makes the burger. That and the mushroom's crispy outside are perfection. Their super skinny crinkle cut fries are also ace (perfect soft to crispy bits ratio, come onnnnn!) and their milkshakes are pretty good (if you can finish them. Burgers are small-ish, on the other hand).So yes, we like Shake Shack in the UK because it's pretty darn good and reliable but... someone always screws up somewhere. Here it's their buns! (Which is really unfortunate because it's meant to be their 'thing').In the states they're soft, fluffy, almost sweet and a little brioche-like (nomzzzz). These just miss the mark ever-so-slightly, which is cool except that when you eat the bun on its own, you notice that the outside has a weird 'skin' that's a little dry and sticks to your teeth. I swear it's something in London's nasty hard water.On the bright side, you probably won't be having the bun on its own anyway so despite my bun gripes, they're pretty decent above-average-chain-place-type burgers.",

I don't usually welcome tomato in my burgers but thoroughly enjoyed the slice in my double Shack burger. The cheese had to be the best thing (besides the bun) about the burger. Not too sure which kind it was but it complimented the beef patties perfectly!The Milkshake was on point - I stuck to my usual and went for the Peanut Butter kind (although thinking back I wish I would have been more adventurous and gone for something slightly different).I will definitely put this on my regular spot list, I just have to try out Five Guys first.Get down there already...!",

    "text": "While the appearance may resemble that of a McDonalds cheeseburger the taste of the burger was far superior with a really well seasoned patty cooked to perfection and smothered in cheese. I chose to have raw onions in mine as well, yum! Like Bleeker Street, ShakeShack also have their own special sauce which I opted not to have as I'm really not a fan of anything more than cheese on my burger. The crinkle cut chips were also really good which is always a surprise to me as I'm not a fan of chips in general.My friend and I chose to share a large fresh lemonade instead of one of the signature shakes which we both agreed was totally amazing. The rest of the prices seemed to be on par with other burger joints in London and this was definitely the best I've tasted recently.",

The service was good for the large amount of people waiting for the food and the food was good. Not great or spectacular, just good. The burger was nice but a little salty; the fries were great, and the shake was pretty good!
