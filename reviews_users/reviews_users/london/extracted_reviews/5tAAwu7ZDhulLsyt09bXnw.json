    "text": "Looking for fabulous, inexpensive food in Kensington? Head here for some of the tastiest British food I've had in a while! Kedgeree, Cauliflower Cheese, mashed potato, pies, homemade soups, it's all their on the menu. \u00a35 for starters and \u00a37 for mains. They even have a specials board and a cute waiter... perfect! The place itself is super cute, cosy nooks and crannies to snuggle in, plates, jugs, saddles nailed to the wall. And not in a comical, tacky way. This actually looks like the inside of a pub dining room close to the village my parents live in. The staff if a little snarky about the fact we wanted to try almost all the sides and only one main between us were very helpful and our food came out super quick.This really is one of the best dining options in the area, really it should be 5 stars but I think I'm just going to have to try it again to make sure!",

The menu is full of traditional English home cooking of the sort that most will remember from childhood, but it is overpriced by about 30% and ours seemed to have been prepared without much care and attention. My potted prawns were 'nice' enough, but accompanied by what looked and tasted like Hovis bread and my main course was tough and uninspiring. I reckon most high street supermarket premium ready meals would make a tastier meal. When I went it was full of Americans, and I guess really that's what it is for - tourists looking for the olde world. If you want good food - avoid.",

Good scotch and whiskey selection (again, good on a cold and rainy day) and the other couples dining in the restaurant that evening were very friendly and helpful in giving us other great places to visit while in town.Definitely will be stopping there again on our next visit in the fall!",

    "text": "Hmm. I've been here twice now and I feel a bit confused on the best way to review this place.First, above all else, this place is pure atmosphere. I think it's one of the dishiest rustic environments, while remaining just classy enough to make it a perfect date spot, or an intimate night out with close friends.Of course, food matters just as much in these locations, and that's where the confusion sets in. I've had great food here, and now I've had boring food here. Partridge night: This was my first time having partridge, and although difficult to eat, it was quite enjoyable here. I opted for the red cabbage and bacon/peas as a side. The accompanying gravy and hollandaise were lovely, and obviously made with care. Everything was moderately spiced, but quite enjoyable overall. The onion tart was extremely pricey for the size (9 pounds!!!) but was simple perfection. Overall, it was simple food done really well and I left quite pleased with Maggie Jones's.Bream night: Dining again, I tried the sea bream while my friend had the fillet. It was at this point my alarm was raised. Both the sea bream (18.50 I think) and the fillet (26.50) were acceptable..but very lackluster for the price. The fillet was especially forgettable and small; this is outrageous for the pricetag. I believe it was the most expensive item on the menu and it was easily the most disappointing. My sea bream was solid, but left too untouched to be standout. It was a nice cut of fish..that's it! The next problem was that both of these dishes did not come with any sides...so at this point we've spent over 40 pounds for a small fish, a mediocre steak...and nothing else. Very hard to internalize. Fortunately I ordered the cauliflower cheese, which was nice but yet again lacking finesse in the long run. We then tried dessert. I had the bread pudding, which was a bit boring but definitely edible..I feel that was the point so I wasn't too concerned. My dining mate said the creme brulee was fantastic, though topped with a bit too much sugar for his liking.It's interesting to note that my first trip here was when they were busy, and the second trip while they just opened. Odd.I think that you should go here for more traditional food: pies and tarts, rumps and roasts. \u00a0The atmosphere suggests that it's a classic British restaurant, so go with that feeling. For all the timeless recipes, they have odd items like crab and avocado which simply do not fit in. I wish this place cut about 10 items off of it and focused on what they are good at.I must reiterate that MJ's is one of the most romantic places I have been. Service is nice and you will feel at home instantly.",

I emailed the contact and they were extremely accommodating and helpful in getting us a seat. Even when I changed the time at the last minute (via email no less), they were extremely friendly about it and when we arrived, they had noted the change and had us seated immediately.What makes this place special beyond the excellent food was the DECOR and AMBIANCE: about the most charming restaurant that I have ever eaten in. My wife and i had a nice romantic booth with candles and the privacy we needed to have a fantastic dinner with conversation we don't normally get to enjoy with our 2 year old at the table :)The food was great as well, not the best we had while in London, but definitely high quality and delicious. Would definitely go back and recommend this place to travelers looking for a friendly and warm dining experience.",

    "text": "Wake up Maggie I think I got something to say to you: I like you, I really like you. I know your last name isn't May, but I don't care, you're lovely and you warmed my heart.When I had some friends visiting from out of town that wanted to meet for dinner, I suggested we should go for traditional British fare. When in Britain, right? In my quest for an amazing British meal, Maggie Jones's popped up. To be honest, it wasn't my first choice (I was going for something a bit more fine dining), but my friends seemed into it, so here we came.I'm so glad we did. The decor is fantastic. There's an eclectic mix of things hanging from the walls. It's a bit retro, but yet cool and modern and they aren't trying too hard so they don't come off as being too hipster. Weirdly, for a British restaurant the music playing was only 50's and 60's American. There are special boards everywhere with the specials and vegetables of the day, so you don't have to worry about remembering anything. They sat us downstairs as it was a hot day and apparently cooler down there which it was, but mostly due to the A/C blowing directly on our table (which I was fine with, the candles on the other hand, weren't as they kept burning down incredibly fast, but the servers were incredibly good about changing them out). They start you out with a bit of bread (their brown bread is heavenly) and some crudites with a bit of dressing. Yum.Food-wise everything we had was great. I started with the Stilton mousse and the other half got the pate. The mousse was spot on with a big blue cheese punch in the face served with perfectly toasted bread and a bit of salad. Yum. The bite of pate I had was also really well done. I ordered the steak and kidney pie for the main (but I almost went with the liver) and the other half got the venison special. I also ordered some chips (when in Britain, right?), red cabbage and cauliflower cheese as sides for the table to share. The pie was fan-freaking-tastic. It had a rich sauce and the taste of kidneys just came through the sauce amazingly. The crust was wonderfully cooked and delicious. (Unfortunately it was just a top crust pie, I could only imagine it as a full on pie!) The sides were all really well done, with the cauliflower cheese being a favorite. Lots of baked cheese on top and crunchy, tasty cauliflower. There's also a good wine list, and we had three different bottles, all of which were really nice bottles. You can also opt for the house wine where they measure how much you drink by the end of the night.For dessert, the other half and I split the bread pudding and the apple crumble. One of our friends ordered the Cambridge burnt cream. The bread pudding was thick and soft and spongy as a good bread pudding should be. It was a tad cold in the middle, but it didn't deter me from eating it. (A bit of warning for raisin haters, the bread pudding does indeed have raisins.) The crumble was well done, but not amazing. I did have a bite of the burnt cream and it was by far the winner. The cream is so flavorful and the burnt sugary topping was perfect.Oh Maggie, you brought me so much joy. I will recommend you to anyone who wants to go get British food, as you are one of the best.",

Very romantic but boisterous in equal amounts which is a great mix. The food served here is what I imagine rich Victorians to feed on. I travel a lot and I've never seen PARTRIDGE on the menu. Expected alot of venison, boar along with traditional home made meat pies. They have a few veggie options too.Service is slow like molasses but I can only imagine how small the kitchen is in this old building, so I am willing to let it slide. Make sure to make an evening of it. Not a quick bite on the way to something else.",

    "text": "I can happily say with confidence that I have found my new favorite restaurant in London. On many previous trips/layovers in London I had peered through the dark outside widows and saw what appeared to be a very cozy atmosphere where diners were dining by beautiful warm candlelight. So, one of my good friends and renowned \"foodie\" and I decided to try Maggie Jones's. From the moment we entered the restaurant where we were promptly and warmly greeted by Patrice and Christine, I knew we were in for a treat! If you are like me, and love authentically rustic d\u00e9cor with dark stained hardwoods and candles glowing on every table, you too will fall in love with this amazing gem of a restaurant. The lovely jazz music from the 30s to the 50s adds to this unbelievable establishment's ambiance just as the hanging baskets with dried flowers do. Now, let's talk FOOD! The menu is simple, elegant and wholesome, yet, unique with interesting specials displayed on a movable chalk board that the servers bring to each booth or table. I have had the pleasure of being served by Oliver twice now and he is both personable and professional. The timing of the food delivery and presentation was spot on! I thoroughly enjoyed one of the freshly prepared salads as a starter and then, \"as the Brits say\", tucked in to a perfectly seasoned and deliciously cooked rump steak of lamb. The side dish of their baked cauliflower & cheese served in a mini iron skillet was delectable! If you choose to dine on the lower level, you can watch the amazing Portuguese chefs, Grace and Martin create their magic on a plate that I'm told they've been doing here for nearly 40 years. After an amazing dinner, we were given a full tour of the 3 level rustic wonderland known as Maggie Jones's along with some fun history about the former \"home\" now restaurant. The prices are neither inexpensive nor overpriced especially in London near Kensington! But I find the value more than fair for what I will call my favorite dining experience in 8 years of laying over in London on a weekly basis. Yes, I'm an international flight attendant who has had the good fortune of experiencing some amazing meals, especially in Paris and many other cities in Europe and South America. I have to say, Maggie Jones's is now at the top of my list!",

We almost gave up on it as we could not find it at first but I am so glad that we did. We were the first ones there for the evening. The staff were warm and welcoming and the waiter..the skinny french guy(I think French) was so funny and sweet. They let us sit upstairs. The food was delicious. I am still sad to this day that I did not order the roast chicken like our son. I am still craving it 2 months later. My fish pie was delicious. I loved the decor. I showed the pictures to my sister and her kids and the funniest comment I got was that it looked like Shrek and Fiona should be dining there....please do not take that as an insult. I thought it was cute. The most amusing thing for us was that they seated 2 older couples at the table next to us. Low and behold we heard them talking about Bart and other San Francisco transport. What are the odds the only two table occupied upstairs would have people from San Francisco. The food fresh and made from scratch and the decor adorable. I found that the food in Britain smells like I remember food smelling when I was a kid. It has no preservatives and it just smelt delicious. The only thing is that I can never remember the name. We have a supermarket close by called Mollie Stones and I always end up calling this place Mollie Jones. I could not yelp it yesterday because I had to wait until the guys got home so that I could ask them the name of the restaurant...pretty worrying at 45..LOL",

Wrapped up dinner with Apple crumble with cream and a coffee. Coffee came with a gallon of milk on the side (I asked for cream or milk) and the huge mug made us laugh hysterically. Service was sweet but took a bit of time to get our food. We sat in a corner booth and for a while it felt way to dark, like medieval times, trying to read the wine menu by candle light (literally). For a moment we thought about asking for a second or third candle or even travel back to modern times and use a light. I guess they really did a good job with the ambience and decorations. The place was great. Yes, all good things are expensive so be prepared for that.",

Interesting, upscale, cozy, vaguely romantic and instantly you're quite interested in sitting down and ordering because you know it's going to be a most pleasant experience. They've captured something special here and they're proud to share it with you. The food is wonderful and inspired. I had stuffed pork with apple (crunchy fat back, tender and salty sweet) and crisp fresh French green beans. One table mate had the guinea fowl (difficult to ensure moist succulence) and the other had Chicken with Tarragon sauce. We had dessert (shouldn't have but well worth the extra minutes in the gym). Apple crumbles with cream and lemon Sorbet. I fly to London 3-4 times a month and while there are many wonderful restaurants none are worth going back to regularly. Maggie Jones just became my Go-To Must-Go place. I regret telling about it but from the number of people there on a Sunday night--I'm not the only fan. I could eat here every time I visit and most certainly will.",

Upon entering the dimly lit restaurant, we were greeted by the cheery staff who were all dressed in fun costumes. The place was decorated with streamers and the tables sprinkled with confetti and party poppers. Service throughout the night was exceptional. Every waiter ensured that we enjoyed our experience. As for the food, it was a New Years Eve set menu for \u00a340/person. For starters, I had the \"Maggie's Tart,\" which comprised of soft warm eggs and spinach. The tart was cooked to perfection! For the main, I had the \"Chicken & Artichoke Pie.\" Again, the chefs knocked it out of the park. The top crust had just the right amount of crisp. The pie was packed with chicken too. The main came with saut\u00e9ed spinach and purple cabbage, both of which complimented the pie well. To end the night, I had the bread pudding. Despite how full I was, this pudding had to the best I have ever tasted. The pudding itself was not overly sweet. The bread had a crispy outer edge, soft, spongy center, and raisins \u00a0for added punch of flavor.Staff, food, and atmosphere all taken into account... a definite 5 out of 5. I would love to explore the rest of their menu whenever I return to London in the future!",

Tall wooden booths and tables are lay out though this narrow floor plan. It's dark and intimate, and I love it! The service is polite and prompt. The Louie dressing with my Shrimp Cocktail with arugula is delicious. The Rump of Lamb with garlic & Rosemary taste juicy, seasoned, pan seared and cooked to the right temperature. My wife's Pork shoulder is succulent as well! The meats are served by it self, so ordering a side of potatoes chips and saut\u00e9ed spinach are the perfect accompaniments!

    "text": "I'm not sure how this place has so many stars. Maybe they changed wait staff and chef. Where to begin...The atmosphere was cute they put candlesticks in champagne bottles. However, that was about the only thing we liked about this place. To start we ordered steak, quiche, and soup. We told them to bring things out as they were ready. 45 minutes went by and we hadn't seen any food. At an hour we said something and a nice man who was not our waitress looked very confused and went and checked on our food. Apparently the waitress (very rude and unprofessional) told them to bring our food out all together. Why I don't know because we said several times we were hungry and to bring things out as ready. \u00a0After an hour and twenty minutes our food came out and the waitress said \"sorry there were a lot of big parties downstairs.\" Just to be clear there were none when we arrived and only one table of six when we left. Also not a very professional way to handle the situation. The food itself was quite bland. Really nothing good to say about it. After that long we were expecting great food, and it wasn't good. As we were paying, the table next to us (that had the same waitress) complained because apparently she got one person's order completely wrong. She once again was missing, not to deal with the problems she caused. The same poor waiter had to fix her mess. As we left we saw her do nothing in the corner while the other waiter got yelled at because of her mistakes! I couldn't believe it. She didn't care at all and didn't apologize to their table. What really set me off (I don't think I've ever given a one star review and rarely a two star..) is that I got severe food poisoning from this place. Did I mention it started on my 11 hour flight back to the states. Do not go here!!!!",

    "text": "All I can say is WOW!! My friend and I were in London and looking for a great place to eat on a Saturday night. We were extremely lucky to find Maggie Jones! When we walked in we quickly realized this was a place where reservations should have been made. But the staff was amazingly accommodating and we were able to get a beautiful booth. The restaurant is dark and has an eclectic feel of the English countryside. The food was superb! I had the lamb and the moment I tasted it I felt as if it may have the best thing I've ever eaten! I didn't want it to end! Let's just say our meal didn't feel like a meal but rather an event of wonderful flavors, coupled with incredible service! I am so sad that I live in LA and will not have a chance to eat here again until next spring. You can bet the moment the plane touches the ground, you know where I'll be headed!!",

Simple food done right. I will say that my lamb was a little over cooked, but it was still amazing. They offered to bring me out mint jelly without me asking too. My very picky boyfriend and travel companions loved it all. They best part was when they caught be putting some salt on the pot de creme-- they looked at me like I was crazy! We had a lot of laughs as I assured them it was amazing, and I'm sure they tried it later lol.",

    "text": "Sadly, I was quite disappointed again, for such a lovely and cosy place. This being my third time, only because my friend who organised the annual get together chose this place, and I was willing to give it another try.I have yet to understand the rave reviews regarding the food though, but it may be it is because we always go for the Sunday Set Menu and not a la carte, which is difficult to get on a Sunday it seems, more of that later.So the first time, had a great impression of the place because of the impressive decor. \u00a0We were seated upstairs, and I loved the cosiness, but the food was so, so, no refinement in cooking or presentation, standard fare really.The second time, our party was seated downstairs, and as I could not stay for long and would not have time for the full Sunday set lunch, asked to order just a main course from their a la carte menu. \u00a0What a palaver, it seems this is not available on Sundays. Finally, after much to-ing and fro-ing, and exasperation on the part of the harassed waiters, I was able to just order a fish dish that they will prepare for me, but the fish they offered was not available, so had the alternative, which tasted very bland.So third time lucky? \u00a0Well let see, our group was seated downstairs, and we had all pre-ordered except two people, who were then given the Sunday Set Menu on a blackboard. \u00a0I had the roast pork, which was very dry, and then realised that there should have been gravy to accompany it, and when I looked for the gravy boat, it was at the other end of the table, and was empty. \u00a0I managed to attract a waitress' attention as she passed me to serve another table, and I had not expected her to neglect the other table to serve me, but her attitude was a bit rude, when I tried to get her attention. \u00a0Finally, after waiting for her to come back, and she did not, I asked another waiter who happened to pass by with his hands full, and I mentioned if he could help me, and he looked at his full hands and I immediately, expressed, obviously, when he was ready. In no way was I expecting him to drop everything!I was surprised that they only supplied one gravy boat for seven Sunday roasts, on a large table. To make matters worst, whilst I tried to explain to the busy, stressed out waiter, the other waitress took the gravy boat and filled it up and left it at the other end of the table to me, so it was out of reach, and the people at the other end, thought \"great more gravy\", obviously not enough before, and proceeded to hand it around at their end, amidst protests from me! \u00a0I was slightly miffed that the waitress did not return the gravy boat to me since I specifically asked for it, it would have been much better customer service to do so.My companion had lamb, and he said that was very chewy. The roast beef and sea bream were probably the better bet, although one person was not happy that the beef was well done, when they requested otherwise. \u00a0Again the service was lacking. \u00a0The person who had the sea bream, after finishing his meal, spied a dish of baby potatoes at the far end of the table, untouched, and thought that was probably for his dish, and he would have liked some, if he saw it. \u00a0Again, why put it at the other end of the table to the person who should have it. At any other restaurant, the waiter would announce the arrival of the sides, or put it with or near the person who had ordered that meal. I know they are busy but the waiter/waitress looked stressed and harassed, and not at all welcoming, and if that is their mood, then that rubs off on the overall restaurant atmosphere, creating an unrelaxed place. I had expected a better level of service and better quality food in South West London. Luckily, the company we had was great, and I hope the organiser will choose somewhere else next time for our get together.",

But here goes...The good:The decor and ambience is great -- complete with candlelight, eclectic furniture, mismatched plates and cutlery. Very welcoming with loads of character.The staff is friendly and attentive and totally professional.My starter, onion soup, was excellent. Seriously good. But the problem is that it raised my expectations very high. The main course:The roast chicken was presented beautifully with perfectly rendered skin and a fantastic deep color. Unfortunately it was on the dry side and the seasoning was uneven. My friend ordered the steak and kidney pie. Again, the presentation was beautiful -- very traditional with a deep colored crust. Unfortunately the steak had burnt during searing and when it was deglazed that burnt taste spread throughout the entire filling. The sides: chip were over-fried and the gravy was over-seasoned. The cauliflower cheese however was very nice. For dessert we ordered the apple crumble which was very traditional and lovely. Unfortunately the custard had a flowery under taste that I couldn't quite place and took away from the dish. Even so, I think this place is wonderful. Everything tasted homemade and even though it was a little hit or miss, the heart of this place is unmistakable.",

(If downstairs, maybe ask for a table away from the front window). \u00a0We had found it through the Rick Steves guide and are glad we followed his advice.My husband and I had a delicious lunch which, with the quality of food, seemed a great value and bargain. Duck Liver Pate was delicious, as was our main, the stuffed roast pork. LARGE PORTIONS great for sharing.An absolute charming, romantic gem. Maggie Jones deserves 6 stars!",

I felt like I was a grandmother's house with baskets of dried flowers lining the ceiling, wax-dripped wine bottles posing as candlestick on each table, and jazzy old-school music. The food was solid (my husband and I both got salads which were good, but not the best. fresh nonetheless) and the kind service and cool neighborhood buzz about it means it will definitely get a repeat visit from us.",

Most of the seating is in little booths, and you can get crammed in sometimes, but it's worth it. Lots of dried flowers and old bits of furniture and equipment dotted around. Wine is served in large carafes and you only pay for what you drink, which can be dangerous as it is always on the table. Love this restaurant, going to go and book it now, it's the perfect time of year.",

    "text": "I must have walked past this restaurant hundreds of times, but this afternoon was the first time I had dined at this lovely restaurant. Located just off Kensington Church Street (High Street Kensington end), one of our colleagues recommended this to me and my other female colleague, Emma. As Emma is leaving for a new job in a couple of weeks, we thought we'd enjoy going out for lunch before she goes. It's really quaint inside, we were warmly greeted and although the place was reasonably busy, we managed to get a table. We looked at the lunch special menu, and we ordered steak and kidney pie (which came with free sides of peas & carrots). The plates that the food were served on were really cute (country style), and most importantly the pie and vegetables (which counted towards my 5 a day ;-)) was delicious. Obviously no meal is complete without a dessert and the waiters brought a blackboard to show us what was on offer, Emma had bread & butter pudding and I had apple crumble and cream \u00a0let's just say, it didn't take long before we finished! The lunch menu was reasonable in cost, our meals together with a drink (and service charge) came to about \u00a320 each. All in all, both Emma and I thought the food and service was soo good, we're making this one of our favourites. Good hearty English food in the heart of Kensington. Just BEAUTE :-)",

    "text": "This place is a rare treat. I only get there once every few years (it can be a bit pricey), but when I do it's fab. What an amazing English restaurant (yes, it's English grub). But they specialise in Game. So if you want the best Duck, Venison, Pheasant or Wild Boar, this is the place. But even roat chicken is brilliant. Not to mention all the veg, salads, yorkies, etc. It's very quirky, with farm related stuff everywhere, old bicycles, wagon wheels, spades (you name it) stuffed into every nook and cranny (of which there are loads). The tables are scrubbed pine and the chairs are quirky too (even a few church pews) - but still comfy). It's very dimly lit, but it adds to the atmosphere. Waiter are very friendly and just the right side of cheeky. the salad dressing is the best I have ever tasted. I have begged them to give me the recipe for years but they wont. LOL! It's al good and you can't get a bad meal here. Save it for spesh and save up a bit first and have a great time. But be careful as the servings are big (even at lunch time). Best dessert: Burnt Treacle Creme Brulee. Yummy. Oh, BTW, they serve a great house wine and they charge you by the inch. I kid you not, they bring a ruler and measure how much you have drunk at the end. Fun! A really really different, intimate and superb restaurant.",

    "text": "Maggie Jones' is a wonderful place. Staffed by some of the nicest waiters in the universe, this restaurant is a like a ramshackle farmhouse over three floors. Rough hewn wood and rickety furniture is accompanied by all manner of rural oddities hanging from the walls and ceiling. It's an exceptional date venue with the tables for two being discrete little booths and the majority of the lighting being candles. The food is excellent and entirely English. The sauteed oyster mushrooms, rocket and parmesan salad is my favourite starter though the selection of soup, globe artichoke, corn on the cob provide good competition. For mains, it is mostly roasts and grilled fish but all delicious in my experience. It's definitely worth checking out the specials board as there is always something worth considering. The wine list is mostly french though there is an Argentinian Malbec on the menu that I can't go past. All up it's one of my favourite local restaurants for an intimate date or a larger dinner.",
