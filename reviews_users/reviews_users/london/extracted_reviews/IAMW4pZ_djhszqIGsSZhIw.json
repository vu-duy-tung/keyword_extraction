    "text": "An outstanding high tea - that I would easily recommend to any friend looking to celebrate a special occasion (or to take a Mum / Mum-in law out for a weekend treat). The service was something of a crescendo, in that it kept getting better and better with each course: a lovely mango and berry mousse to start us off, followed by a stilton and onion tart, a variety of outstanding finger sandwiches (egg salad = my favourite), three small cakes (chocolate, red velvet, and white chocolate), and then... petit-fours, tea cakes, and scones! The clotted cream and strawberry jam both stand out as highlights.The selection of tea and attentiveness of the staff were both unparalleled amongst other afternoon teas I have been too. And I thought that the venue, in the middle of the beautiful, light-filled Heinz Beck restaurant of hotel, was top-notch. Any complaints? I thought that the waiter could have been a bit more engaging on a discussion of what tea to choose. He immediately forwarded the Lanesborough blend after my asking him for a black tea to recommend. It was delicious, but I would have enjoyed drilling a bit deeper into tea terroir. For those craving a traditional, opulent tea experience, I think that this one is hard to beat.",

There's a wide range of teas to choose from, as well as small bites to indulge in. It's a little more on the fancy side so don't come in wearing a tanktop and shorts. We had a pretty late seating time (4:30PM) but come earlier and allot for a few hours so you can leisurely sit here and enjoy it.",

    "text": "Best Afternoon Tea in the whole country? That was the verdict of the sages at the UK tea council and until I see better, I'm not going to disagree. This is top class, the veritable pinnacle of pinky-finger dining.Tea is taken in the glasshouse central atrium of the stunning luxury hotel. Light pours in onto your white clothed-tables and comfortable bepillowed chairs. A relaxing piano plays out of sight and sleek waiters and waitresses effortlessly glide between tables somehow without raising a single decibel.The usual canapes, petit fours, scones and finger sandwiches are presented to the highest class, and with a few interesting twists too that are politely described when each selection is brought. Walnut bread slices filled with coronation chicken? Yes please. It's sublime picturesque snacking well-worthy of it's 30 quid price tag.What else? Oh yeah... the tea of course doofus! You're not going to forget that. Why? Because the Lanesborough pulled out their secret weapon last year to win the hotel afternoon tea battles by a country mile - and the weapon of choice was a tea sommelier. It sounds a bit-over-the-top, but why shouldn't tea be chosen and paired up carefully by an expert? After all, there is far more variation in how different green teas taste than different white wines. The attention to different blends and different classes is excellent and will make choosing your tea more difficult than an A-Level. But that's ok, because they let you change your mind when your pot needs refilling.Sigh... I want to go again today. Relax under the chandeliers, sip tea, eat scones and sandwiches and feel pampered by the world-class waiters. I'll just look at the photos instead and drool all over my laptop.",

You can't really go wrong with that can you?!As I've mentioned previously, I do love an Afternoon Tea and I can indeed praise The Lanesborough, particularly for the utterly impeccable service we received and so much tea refilling that I was fit to burst. The food, champagne and tea was all superb and the surroundings - in the beautiful Glasshouse were delightful - and helped along by the quite pretty waiters too. Come on, it does help! I also liked the fact that there were lots of other groups of nice, happy people all enjoying treats there in some shape or form, whether it was birthdays, anniversaries or hen do's. I think I still but prefer The Ritz but The Lanesborough comes in a very close second. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Teawith my cousin.It was so disappointing experience or I just had too high expectation?The service earned 1 star- the guys over there looked so can't be ass (excuse my language but this was how these servants looked like) to serve generally. I found only one guy working hard serving with quality. A jar of milk was not filled immediately thus I waited around 15 min for that - yes it means I did not have tea for 15 min. A guy made a mistake on serving tea as my cousin asked Assam tea and he served English breakfast tea, which I recognized by looking and smelling at it. Eh, these are two different tea? Oh boy... There was not leaf in inside of the pot so I could not blew by myself. How these guys know how I would like to have tea? They didn't even ask me about it? One guy was so rude as he did not finish the sentence and while he was talking he was also walking away. He needs to be well trained as this is very basic thing on communication, not only because he works for Lanesborough.The silver looked shabby as it was all scratchy. The tea did not taste great at all which did not earn a star at all, of course because it was not how I wanted it. So disappointing experience - I don't think I'm gonna come back. If I have to have tea around this area, I will go back Four Season without thinking twice.However one of the highlight of this afternoon tea is lemon clotted cream, which was unusual and it wasn't something you can have in other venues. I liked the selection of musical Pianist made.Piano and lemon clotted cream earned 2 stars.",

    "text": "Did not have the afternoon tea, but spent one night in the hotel. It was the highlight of our trip to Europe! We were guests at Downton Abby for the night....or maybe Buckingham Palace. It really is that special! Your butler even offers to unpack for you. Every wish you could possibly have is made available. We asked for sparkling water and in two minutes our butler arrived with two large bottles of sparkling water on a silver tray with a starched linen doily and two cut crystal glasses! Out room was the original. We were upgraded to a suite consisting of a magnificent wood paneled entry way, three stairs up to an old english library with books lining the walls and flowered heavy curtains, and then three steps down to our bedroom with a canopy over the bed. The bathroom still had the magnificent marble inlays and even a bidet and yet had a lovely separate shower. Bath products were plentiful and were displayed in crystal decanters. We even found an old fashioned long shoe horn with a back scratcher hand at the other end. Turn down service left two bottles of water again on a silver tray and a small poem by Sir Walter Scott wishing us sweet dreams! At check in there is no hint of a computer. Just a leather blotter on an old English desk. The receptionist disappears for a moment and then reappears with your room key(real keys!) and shows you personally up to your room. This is a true five star hotel. The staff in coat tails and top hats are lovely and warm and helpful. We were even given business cards with our name imprinted on them. The location is wonderful. It is quiet, but easy walking distance to Knightsbridge and Harrods one way, and Buckingham Palace the other way. What better location is there?We have found our dream hotel and will always return to the Lanesborough!Note: this is a grown up hotel. If you're \u00a0looking for hip and modern stay at the W! This is NOT the W!!!",

    "text": "I never had tea parties with my stuffed animals growing up, but if someone had told me there would be scones and clotted cream involved, goodness knows things would've been different.Apsleys is located in the Lanesborough and the atmosphere is appropriately fine and classic. \u00a0The dress code is definitely on the formal side - collars, prim shoes, pinkies up, and stop shaking that foot. \u00a0I don't generally prefer this sort of ambience with my food, but this was afternoon tea in the heart of London. \u00a0Prettiness and manners were a part of the package.My mother and I opted for the Lanesborough Tea, the most economical option at \u00a333.00 per person. \u00a0For my tea I opted for the Rose of the Orient, a light and floral green tea blend. \u00a0She chose the house signature Lanesborough Afternoon Blend, a good black tea meant to be sipped without milk. \u00a0Both were lovely, and came in charming silver teapots. \u00a0I adore teapots.The actual \"tea\" portion of the afternoon tea, however, was entirely secondary to the food. \u00a0Soon after we sat down we were presented with little glasses of chestnut mousse with apricot compote and chocolate mousse on top. \u00a0Then came the quiches of goat cheese and leek and the three-tiered tower of goodies. \u00a0The large bottom tier held several mini sandwiches - smoked salmon on brioche; roast beef, stilton cheese, onion chutney, and rocket salad on granola bread; tomato bread with cucumber and cream cheese; Cornish hen chicken curry with raisin on plain white; and finally, tuna. \u00a0The top two tiers offered toasted teacakes and pastries - tea bread marbled with chocolate, plum cheesecake, lemon cake, Coca-Cola chocolate cake, apricot cream and fresh raspberries on macaron, and passionfruit pound cake with coconut jelly. \u00a0Each bite was delectable and the presentation delightful. \u00a0The quiche, the roast beef sandwich, and the Coca-Cola cake were especially memorable.When the tower of food was done, we moved onto the best part of the tea - marvelous, buttery scones with pots of lemon curd, home-made strawberry jam, and clotted \u00a0Devonshire cream. \u00a0I had two types, one white and one brown with raisins, and they were both out of this world. \u00a0I'd always thought of scones as hard, dry, and unappetizing, but these were moist yet crumbly little biscuits loaded with butter and deep bracing flavor. \u00a0They were good alone but even better with dabs of cream, curd, and preserves. \u00a0I wanted to eat them forever.Which brings me to my one big complaint about Apsleys. \u00a0Correct me if I'm wrong, but I was under the impression that our scones and sandwiches and everything would be replenished throughout the tea. \u00a0I didn't expect immediate reinforcements every time a tray emptied, but I was surprised and a bit dismayed that our server didn't at least check in with us on occasion to see if we wanted anything more. \u00a0(To be fair, he asked early on if we needed more sandwiches - once.) \u00a0I saw other tables served with brand new scones when their plates emptied, but we had our two each and got no love thereafter. \u00a0In fact, our waiter disappeared for the entire second half of our tea. \u00a0When I finally thought we were being checked in on, it turned out he was only trying to clear us out before seating started for dinner.Now how fat American of me is it that I ignore the poised tea-pouring and the straight backs and slicked hair to complain that I wanted more scones? \u00a0Very fat American, yes, that's correct. \u00a0That said, \u00a333.00 should buy better service at a place like Apsleys.That said again, the overall experience was excellent and I would love to go back. \u00a0In the meantime I will try every scone recipe on the internet in the hopes of duplicating the Lanesborough version in my State-side kitchen.",

I had to wade through billowy clouds of bubbles to turn off the tap. \u00a0Oops. \u00a0I do not think my butler was amused but he smiled through my apologies and squeegeed the never ending bubbles with aplomb. \u00a0As I ate breakfast one morning, I commented to my butler that the granola was one of the best things I had ever eaten. \u00a0When I returned from a meetiing, a five pound bag of granola awaited me in my room with a note from my butler telling me to \"enjoy\". \u00a0I carried that bag of granola throughout Europe. . .cursing it daily but unwilling to part with it.It may have changed but they used to make custom stationery - \"In Residence - Lainie L.\" \u00a0 OMG! \u00a0I thought this was absolutely the cats pajamas! \u00a0I still have my stationery. \u00a0A totally different time in my life. .. a totally different life. \u00a0I will never forget it. \u00a0I sometimes long to return but am not sure it will live up to my memories. \u00a0I'd sure like to find out.",

    "text": "I came here with my parents for tea. \u00a0They were visiting, so I'd done a lot of research on the best teas in London before deciding where to take them; the Lanesborough was awarded several \"best tea room\" awards - and I can see why.The Lanesborough Hotel is perched right on the end of Hyde Park Corner. \u00a0As we entered the hotel, the doormen were really warm, and directed us to the tea room, which is toward the back of the hotel - past the lounge area and reception. \u00a0We still had a bit of a wait when we got there, even though we'd made reservations, but the hostess was really nice about this and the wait lasted no more than 10 minutes before we were seated.The tea room is *beautiful*... nicer than Berkeley or Claridges... it's like an atrium with ultra-high ceilings... just being in this gorgeous room, you feel that this is indeed a *grand* tea place. \u00a0Tons of people were there, but you didn't *feel* like tons of people were there... the tables were set far enough apart that you weren't in anybody's space. \u00a0The ambiance was lovely - fantastic flower arrangements, someone playing a harp...  \u00a0 Amazingly, despite the splendid surroundings, the feel of the place was very unpretentious... the staff seemed to understand that teas are a special occasion, and you felt encouraged to relax and enjoy. \u00a0Once we ordered, our tea and tea service was brought out promptly. \u00a0Your typical array of little sandwiches (chicken curry, cucumber), scones with preserves, and of course, cakes; everything was incredible. \u00a0And if you wanted anymore of anything, you were instructed to let the staff know... they would happily indulge requests.I've been to other tea rooms, but this is a real treasure... so much more than hot water and sandwiches. \u00a0The setting and service was 5-star. \u00a0I'd go back in a heartbeat.",

    "text": "Now known as Apsleys, this was once a quite charming locale for taking afternoon tea. The refurbishment is still luxurious and comfortable, but a much more sterile affair in the airy conservatory. Crystal chandeliers, subtle colours, cushy chairs and sofas, soft piano in the background to relax as one is served finger sandwiches, tea cakes, fresh scones, clotted cream and jams. An option is to take champagne or Kir Royale, and the experience is finished off by juicy strawberries and cream. Certainly a pleasant experience, but I'm holding off on the five star review for the moment. I miss the old The Lanesborough and wasn't truly knocked out.",

    "text": "this review is for \u00a0the afternoon tea and not for the hotel itself as we did not stay here. since we were in england, we felt we had to experience high tea. there is quite a variety out there and we decided on this one b/c there was still availability online the week of and it got the UK tea council award. plus its located in a fancy, classy hotel - thought we couldnt go wrong. we went with the \u00a338 option (doesnt include champagne). my friend chose the christmas black tea and i had the lanesborough afternoon tea. the christmas tea was very good. nothing needed to be added to it and it was still delightful. however mine was not so good. perhaps im not used to the strong black tea flavor but i added milk and sugar and it was just slightlyyyyy better. try another if that's not your 'cup of tea'the food consisted of a plate of mini sandwiches, cakes, and pastries. the sandwich with the salmon, the pastry with the macaroons, \u00a0and the cake with the guava was my personal favorites. however it doesn't seem like everyone was served the same thing. perhaps it depends on when you come in. it also came with an additional couple plates of another plates that were just mediocre. the ending 'shot' of wine was very interesting. very sweet and it was hot!! having said that in addition to the price of the tea, vat is 17.5%and service fee of 12.5% is added to your bill... so now your bill just became $$$$! like the amount for dinner! it was an experience and it was at an expensive hotel, so i expected to pay a steep price. was it worth it? mmm not really. i think there could probably be better...",

    "text": "LOL One of the few times my wife demanded she accompany me on a business trip. \u00a0I loved the Cigar Garden, service and room all top notch and here is the rest of the story.Best Afternoon Tea in the whole country? That was the verdict of the sages at the UK tea council and until I see better, I'm not going to disagree. This is top class, the veritable pinnacle of pinky-finger dining.Tea is taken in the glasshouse central atrium of the stunning luxury hotel. Light pours in onto your white clothed-tables and comfortable bepillowed chairs. A relaxing piano plays out of sight and sleek waiters and waitresses effortlessly glide between tables somehow without raising a single decibel.The usual canapes, petit fours, scones and finger sandwiches are presented to the highest class, and with a few interesting twists too that are politely described when each selection is brought. Walnut bread slices filled with coronation chicken? Yes please. It's sublime picturesque snacking well-worthy of it's 30 quid price tag.What else? Oh yeah... the tea of course doofus! You're not going to forget that. Why? Because the Lanesborough pulled out their secret weapon last year to win the hotel afternoon tea battles by a country mile - and the weapon of choice was a tea sommelier. It sounds a bit-over-the-top, but why shouldn't tea be chosen and paired up carefully by an expert? After all, there is far more variation in how different green teas taste than different white wines. The attention to different blends and different classes is excellent and will make choosing your tea more difficult than an A-Level. But that's ok, because they let you change your mind when your pot needs refilling.Sigh... I want to go again today. Relax under the chandeliers, sip tea, eat scones and sandwiches and feel pampered by the world-class waiters. I'll just look at the photos instead and drool all over my laptop.",

The waitstaff is warm and friendly and flutter about in a dance, to pour tea (the only place where I don't feel cheesy raising my pinky and saying \"just a spot of tea!\") and, for hours, bring the most sumptuous and gorgeous desserts to the table. Here, the tea is like wine, something to be lingered over... With menu or sommelier descriptions to match. Do you want tea with chocolate notes? Or something fruity and aromatic? How about earthy and robust? Hold the sugar... Let the surprising complexity wash over your tongue.The ornate tea room is like a fairy tale befitting of Marie Antoinette (before she, you know, lost her head) -- with soft and intricate live piano music to complete the illusion. There are silky pillows, rich fabrics, sumptuous flowers and sparkling chandeliers. You will leave feeling as full as an aristocrat, even though the finger sandwiches are delicious and lite and it's hard to believe that little bon bons could fill one up so efficiently.Frankly, I ate the best Madeleine I've ever had in my entire life. Like, what have I been eating this entire time?! Crap, apparently.",

We were offered suggestions when we asked and also additional servings if desired. We never felt rushed and just felt we were being treated like royalty. Managers and servers checked on us but were never intrusive.The coat room attendant was also extremely cordial.This was my friend's first visit to London and she really wanted to have afternoon tea.

It really was!I booked us in for 4pm on a Saturday afternoon and we opted for the Belgravia Tea which comes with a glass of champagne. Sat in the beautiful, bright Apsleys restaurant with glass roof and comfy sofas we enjoyed the decadent surroundings and cute waiters.Bowls of strawberries and cream, finger sandwiches, cakes, petit fours, fresh toasted teacakes with butter and warm fresh scones with clotted cream, lemon curd and jam. And of course, a glass of champagne and plenty of tea! The tea menu is extensive and once you've chosen they will bring it to you in a beautiful silver tea pot and top you up until you have tea coming out of your ears!Flawless service, fabulous surroundings and great company, we had a really wonderful afternoon.A great option to spoil someone you love. A real treat!",

    "text": "I'm not personally an aficionado of \"High Tea,\" but my lovely wife claims to be, so I surprised her with a visit to The Lanesborough during our brief stay in London. All the little finger sandwiches and scones and sweets made me feel like a little boy forced to play house/tea time with my sister but it was all worth it... instead of pretending to eat a toy plastic cake, i was biting into deliciousness of all varieties... smoked salmon and bbq chicken sandwiches, buttered scones, housemade jams, mousse cakes, macarons...Best of all, as a man of decent heft and of healthy appetite, the trays kept coming, whether savory or sweet. Most, if not all, higher end establishments of \"High Tea,\" like the Lanesboruogh of The Ritz, provide endless amouts of tea and treats. They don't actually advertise themselves as \"ALL YOU CAN EAT\" but that is essentially what High Tea provides... I had to point this out because its not written anywhere and the servers don't tell you either. You just ask for more of whatever you like and they bring it. It may not be so at all places so the best way to find out is to ask. If you happen to be in London, and have the inclination to try High Tea, The Lanesborough is a must go.",

With the piano next to us playing I Dreamed a Dream (brings tears to my tender eyes every time), the experience was relaxing and perfect for a lazy Saturday afternoon.",

    "text": "We enjoyed our very first proper high tea at this beautiful tea room inside the Lanesborough Hotel. I must say, come with an open mind for the experience, not for food when it comes to tea time. The food was not extraordinary but we had a great time nonetheless. We ordered the champagne with tea service. First came strawberries and plain cream which we sprinkled with brown sugar. After champagne, our choice of the suggested Lanesborough house blend tea was served, which was medium bodied, smooth and fragrant. We enjoyed warm mushroom tarts in addition to traditional English finger sandwiches such as cucumber cream cheese and smoked salmon with dill. The petit desert cakes were not overly sweet and we were surprisingly full at the end despite how small the portions were. We also enjoyed biscuits with my husband's much anticipated Devonshire clotted cream (he made a point to try all things English while we were there and this didn't disappoint). Presentation was lovely with real silver serveware and beautiful china. The service was attentive but not overbearing which left plenty of time for uninterrupted conversation and discreet people watching. Not knowing what to expect, we did brush up on English table and tea etiquette beforehand and made a point to dress up which I recommend because it's for tea in London after all, why not! Not to mention if one showed up in a Hanes t-shirt and jeans here, which the annoyingly pompous young bloke at the next table chose to do, one would stick out like a sore thumb at this sort of occasion. Pack that bow tie and the little black dress, high tea will be more fun when you're looking dapper!",
