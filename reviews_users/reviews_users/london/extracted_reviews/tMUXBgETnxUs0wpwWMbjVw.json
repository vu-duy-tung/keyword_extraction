    "text": "I might be slightly biased since I've been to two amazing Yelp events here, but this place is good. I finally got the chance to dine here sans-yelp last week and it was just as nice as I remembered.For my main, I had the pork belly. Yes, this is a steak restaurant, but I wasn't in the mood for steak so I went for something different. I usually like the sound of pork belly but then get slightly disappointed when I get it because there's more fat than meat. But not so at Grill on the Market. There was the perfect balance of meat and fat (more like 70/30). The dish is definitely Asian inspired, served with a side of bak choy and a sweet and sour-ish type of sauce with pineapples, so it's on the sweet side, but I really enjoyed it. My friends all had steaks - rib eye and sirloin - and there were no complaints at the table.As starters, we shared the calamari and the lobster mac n cheese. I had the mac n cheese at a yelp event, but in this instance there was less lobster than I remembered. It was nice and creamy and yum, but for 20 quid, would expect a bit more lobster meat or at least lobster flavour. Lastly, the cocktails... really nice and refreshing! They have a summer cocktail menu all sounding light and refreshing. The strawberry and mint martini is a MUST!And one more thing to note... the live music from a pianist/singer is really good! Perfect entertainment to accompany a nice meal.",

    "text": "So, a friend booked this through a 50% off deal, which included most of the food options, including the monthly special steak offer. \u00a0So, of course we got that. \u00a0I acutally specifically asked if it was really better beef, as it was about 1/3 more expensive (which was actually only \u00a35 on the deal). \u00a0I was assured that 'you can tell the difference'. \u00a0The sirloin was good, better than decent, but in no way exceptional, and not quite as rare as I like it. \u00a0Rare steak is hard to get these days, so they mostly get a pass for that. \u00a0Given the generally average character of their premium offer, I would worry about the quality of the menu's regular steak, but as I said I'm a steak snob.I think the biggest issue here is that if you're a steak-o-file, this probably won't cut it. \u00a0And if you're not, you're not going to want to pay these prices for steak anyway.The service later in the evening on a Saturday was not great -- friendly, but we started at 845, and by the time we were leaving we practically had to do a fan dance to get the bill, despite sitting right by the entry to the restaurant and having 4 servers drying things and chatting about 8 feet from our table. \u00a0I did, however, appreciate that they subed broccoli for the unwanted potatoes without even blinking.Conclusion: For 50% off on food, this place was a good deal. \u00a0Had I been paying full price, I would have been angry.",

Calamari to start was relatively good, though.Cote de Bouef was again passable, but nothing special. Banoffee Mess was a little sickly to finish, but I think that's what one expects from one...The main downside to eating here when we did was the atomosphere; the bar area had some live music going on, which was a pair of tuneless incompetents plucking at guitars and massacring songs from a wide range of artists. Never would I have thought it possible to massacre She's Electric, but somehow they managed it. Far, far too loud as well as entirely lacking in musical talent; they provided amusing conversataional fodder as we attempted to work out what was for the axe next, but the sheer volume made anything else tricky.With the toptable 30% off voucher it becomes better value; avoid it if you don't have that, and if you do check if there's going to be live music before booking.",

    "text": "Disappointing would be the one word to sum up the Smithfield Bar and Grill. It's got many good reviews online, so we were expecting something on par with Gaucho or any similar calibre steakhouse. Instead we got equivalent of a cheap pub meal with a longer wait. 1) We arrived 30 minutes early and had a drink at the bar. Service was very slow as there were only two staff, both busy making cocktails. When our reservation time arrived, we were told they were running late (despite being told they have a 2 hour limit upon making the reservation). We returned to the bar for a 25 minute wait. 2) We were finally seated at a half prepared table (missing chairs, napkins and cutlery not arranged) and informed they had sold out of Kobe burgers, beef burgers, ostrich, lamb, haddock and fish cakes) 3) For one starter, we were told they'd run out of baked bread and would substitute a baguette to be served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The bread was accompanied by a woefully inadequate thimble worth of oil/vinegar. We queried this and were told they had a set measure - but then saw other diners being served significantly larger amounts. 4) We were told they had run out of crushed potatoes to accompany our steaks, so opted for a jacket potato and \"hand cut chips\". The potato was as expected (served with butter), but there was no way the chips were hand cut, as they varied greatly in size, with a lot looking like the dregs from a packet. 5) One steak, requested as well-done was served burned on the outside but medium-rare on the inside. It was sent back, with a replacement offered, but the delay in being served meant we were unable to wait. As a goodwill gesture there was no charge for the steak, as well as the accompanying sauces and sides. The other steak was ok, but nothing of the quality expected from a \"proper\" steakhouse. 6) The Irish coffee served as dessert was nice, and served in a wine glass, which I haven't seen before. 7) They charge the usual 12.5% service charge, but the waiter serving us wrote a massive \"Thank you\" at the bottom of the bill, suggesting they wanted an additional tip. I don't mind tipping on top of a service charge for good service, but definitely not for something that's barely average. If you want a good steak and service, don't bother with The Smithfield Bar and Grill.",

This was a highly trained team. In addition to being good at their jobs individually they seemed to have quite a little vibe going amongst themselves. The menu is a robust one ranging from wagyu kobe beef steaks to fajitas, burgers and great seafood. Quality of the food was great and their wine list well chosen too. Desserts can often be disappointing - but not here.

I love the glamorous interior, the staff were very friendly, the banquette comfortable and the cocktails tasty. I was here for a girly dinner with 5 friends and we enjoyed ourselves immensely. The one thing that spoilt it slightly was that we had only just received our desserts when the waitress (very politely, mind) informed us our two hour slot was up and that if we wanted to linger any longer we'd have to move to the bar. We weren't informed of the 2hr slot when booking, and we would probably have happily spent a fortune more on drinks if we had been allowed to stay at the table a bit longer.

    "text": "London is filled with restaurants of all cuisines - you can find everything from thai and indian through to ethiopian or moroccan - but sometimes you just can't beat a bit of British.British cooking to me means one thing. Meat. I love big, comforting plates of honest food - whether that comes in the form of beef, pork, lamb or chicken. I'm a meat & veg girl through and through so when I was recently invited down to The Grill on the Market, near Smithfields market \u00a0- one look at the menu and I knew I'd love it.  Grill on the Market is a restaurant from the Blackhouse group. They've got restaurants across the country in Chester, Glasgow, Leeds and Manchester and the site at Smithfeilds market is its only London outpost. Blackhouse are all about no-nonsense, honest and simple cooking and that's exactly what they serve up.We wanted to make sure we tried as much of the menu as possible so we ordered the Blackhouse Sharing Plate (\u00a315.75) which allows you to try four starter dishes for a very reasonable price.Honey glazed chicken skewers, salt and pepper calamari, BBQ ribs and baked sweet potato wedges. All served withthree dips - BBQ, Aioli and a mint & coriander creme fraiche. The ribs had that perfect fall-off-the-bone, melt-in-the-mouth texture and the calamari - oh the calamari....Squid has a tendency to be cooked to the point of tasting like rubber in lots of places but GoTM got it just right. Perfectly cooked in a light batter which sung when dunked in the garlic-y mayonnaise. I also spied Scottish mussels on the menu and couldn't resist ordering a bowl to share (I'm greedy, remember people). There's a choice of two sauces so we went with the cream and white wine option (\u00a37.75) which was gorgeous - if a touch under seasoned, but a good squeeze from the lemon provided on our sharing platter totally took it up a gear.Make sure you order some bread as the sauce is just dying to be mopped up once you've eaten the mussels. I even drained the whole bowl with a spoon once the bread was gone...For main courses we both went for rib-eyes. Rib-eye steak is by far my favourite cut - it's covered in fatty marbling which creates a rich, beefy flavour. This cut of steak is best medium-rare as it allows the fat to melt slightly and all the flavour to be absorbed - when cooked right, it tastes incredible.All the steaks at Grill on the Market are served with a choice of baked potato, home-cut chips or mash. We both very predictably went for steak and home-cut chips - because diets are not designed for date-night.Tom kept it fancy by adding a skewer of garlic king prawns (\u00a35) to go with his steak and I chose a B\u00e9arnaise sauce (\u00a32.25), which tasted so good I could have drank it straight from the jug. (I didn't but you know I totally would've)Side orders of roasted field mushrooms (\u00a33.25), green vegetables (\u00a33.75) and onion rings (\u00a33) set off our meal perfectly.By this point we'd eaten a lot of food. But I couldn't leave without pudding. and things definitely kicked up a gear when it came to desserts.Sticky Toffee Pudding and Pavlova are my favourite desserts (not counting Banoffee Pie of course) and here they both were on the menu. It took very little persuasion to get Tom to share both with me...along with a bottle of Picpoul (\u00a326).If you go, I urge you to order the sticky toffee....served piping hot with cold vanilla ice cream it's gooey, sticky, warm and absolutely delicious. I almost wrestled Tom out the way so I could get a bite. \u00a0The raspberry pavlova (\u00a36.75) also did not disappoint. A GIANT meringue stuffed with fresh cream, raspberries, cherries and fruit couli. Wow. Just wow. I would definitely recommend heading to Grill on the Market if you're looking for somewhere lively and affordable to have dinner - it would also be great for drinks after work if you're in the area. We were there on a Friday night and they had live music in the form of a pianist playing all my favourite 80s motown songs - the perfect setting for a brilliant evening.Big thank you to Kamil for arranging our dinner for us and to our waitor Joe for looking after us brilliantly on the night!",

Our server was young and eager to upsell the steak offerings and share the specials which we indulged in - namely, the 1kg Porterhouse, Scottish sirloin, Australian fillet and English fillet. Add starters all around, 3 bottles of malbec and sides to balance out the protein, and we anticipated a hefty bill. At 40% off with the pitch of their membership for future savings, this meal was reasonably good value. At full price, I would have flinched even as our company was picking up the tab. My Aussie burger was left half eaten (I am pregnant and did not want to risk any of the medium rare preparations) as I had asked them to go medium and they went well done. The virgin cocktail menu was also a disappointment - overly sweet and syrupy, but my compatriots ate heartily and drank every last drop. In general, good place if you get the discount for a variety of meats with musical accompaniment, however not decidedly worthwhile at full ticket value.",

    "text": "The Grill on the Market was just around the corner from our hotel in London and we made use of the 50% offer with my Blackhouse group card. It looked very quiet when we first walked in, but this is was just the bar.The restaurant is at the back and up a few steps, I loved the look of the place, it was intimate and had a great buzz to the place. Sadly we had just missed the 241 happy hour on the cocktails. I had the Mussels which were cooked in a curry sauce which tasted amazing and had the Steak Fajitas for the main which was great too! Overall a fantastic meal served by a great waiter. \u00a0I look forward to returning to this great restaurant again!",

    "text": "I've only been into the bar here but I'm already sold on the place. I'm scolding myself for always walking towards Liverpool Street or staying around Bank for after-work drinks, when this place is just a ten minute walk from my office and you can get two-for-one cocktails from 5 to 7pm. Tasty, not-too-sweet, not-too-weak cocktails from an extensive menu as well. Which makes for two very happy hours indeed!There's room to grab a seat even on a Friday with a mix of low sofas and high bar chairs, and the decor is welcoming albeit not particularly distinctive or memorable. The music forces you to speak a notch or two louder than usual, but still well shy of being at shouting levels. The only slightly odd thing is the front-of-house for the restaurant section hidden at the back stands behind a desk in the middle of the bar area which usually causes confusion when people enter expecting to find a restaurant; I'll have to come back to try the food methinks.Overall it's a very solid four star drinks stop, but the barman last week earned them a fifth last week in my book - I paid for two cocktails for \u00a38 with a \u00a320 note and he forgot to bring me change. He was very apologetic once I reminded him, and as my friend and I got up to leave later he offered us both a jagermeister shot to say sorry for his mistake. This was surprisingly ok tasting (being freezing cold and not marred by red bull) and promptly sent us both into girly giggles just in time for the posh dinner we were headed to! Now I realise this makes me sound like an alcoholic pushover... but hey, I appreciated the gesture and it was a nice way to show that any customer's lasting opinion of their bar is important to them. Well I was convinced anyway!",

    "text": "What a STEAK! I went here on Saturday night with my Blackhouse membership card, which does 50% off on certain days. They have a 2 for 1 cocktail special, but you have to go up to the bar. It's a bit silly really but not too much of a hassle. We had the sharing platter which was your standard fried appetizers, but very tasty. We both got the fillet but opted for the higher quality type which was offered on special. The meat was tender and incredibly well cooked. It melted right in my mouth. The chips were crispy and hot. I had the chimichurri sauce which was freshly made and had a lot of flavor. I devoured the steak in a matter of minutes, it was just SO good. And the insane discount just made it all taste that much better. The location of the restaurant is discrete and in a quiet area, as the market is shut at night so it is fairly isolated. However, it isn't too difficult to find, and the ambience inside is lovely and spacious. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a great steak and fries.",

So imagine my delight when fab Yelper Yinnie Chung gave me a birthday treat to 50% off this superb steakhouse right by work. Yes please!! Everything about this evening was perfect; the cocktails served by the chatty waiter were such value for money at \u00a37 and with a happy hour (I recommend the Mint & Violet Crush, especially if you're a fan of Parma Violets - they're not for everyone but I love 'em!). The food was beautifully done, my sirloin was beautifully rare with a really rich bearnaise sauce and to top it off part way through we heard some really chilled music. It took me about 15 minutes to realise that it wasn't recorded but a guy at a piano in the cocktail bar singing in perfect pitch! SO GOOD we even left our waiter a little piece of cake that Yinnie made me - she was so obviously flirting!Without the discount, be prepared to pay for the quality here, I wouldn't be able to afford this normally. A very special treat indeed!",

The fillet part was decent at best while the sirloin part was served pink, but still tasted fairly chewy, which show the quality of the cut is not quite up there with the very best. I took up the advantage of the 50% off winter offer, for me it wasn't really worth it if I had to pay the full price, there are simply many better steak joints out there in London at the similar price tag.",

And relatively expensive for the quality of the food you get. Again, please note I didn't eat their steak - that seems to be what they are good for.The atmosphere tries to be cosy, but I found it too dark and cold.And yes, I am a pain when it comes to service. But if there is something that grinds my nerves about as much as bad service? It's over service that is aimed at making you spend always more. More bread? Here, pay for it? Water? Oh, let me get you some Evian.So yes, my experience at this venue was pretty average, and not out of this world. Not the kind of place I would go back to on my own accord.

Not a problem at all. Highly recommend the mint and violet crush and the raspberry and cucumber cooler! We also tried the pornstar, and zombie (has absinthe in! eek!). The Mandarin Daiquiri tasted a bit like a weaker old fashioned. +Great Staff: it was attentive, and lovely!

We were looking around a bit for the guy to take us to our table?+the other bits on the sharing platter, didn't really work.

The sirloin was a standard size, with a side (mashed potatoes, baked potatoes or chips). No complaints on the food, it was delicious! Followed by a delicious trifle served in a mason jar. Pretty cool :) If you can go on the 50% off deal, it's totally worth it! Even better if you go during happy hour! I loved my Cosmo and Long Island Iced Tea, but I had to season my Bloody Mary with a lot of salt and pepper to get it to a good standard (it was a disappointment in a glass).I definitely recommend this place as a great restaurant to check out in London. I know I'll be dining here any chance I get from now on. Can't wait until I am reunited with this juicy, sizzling, scrumptious steak! :)",

Nice fishtank too :)When everyone eventually arrived, we ordered a plentiful supply of dead animal dishes including the Wagyu steak which was 'wooh!!'.I dont thnk there was much veggie choice which, before everyone chastises me that this is a grill restaurant, shouldnt mean that member(s) of your party should suffer, so maybe another couple of options would be good.The other thing I would say is that everyone who got steaks found them a tad underdone, my medium-rare was rare, my friend's medium was medium-rare etc.Service was good, good beers, will check the wine list when I come next time (my bday in a few weeks!).",

Great dinner and atmosphere and a special treat if you sign up to their club (do it now!). We came here on a Saturday night at 6pm so we could take advantage on the happy hour (goes until 7pm). I ordered the corn-fed chicken breast & beetroot risotto which was an excellent combination and finished off with a sticky toffee pudding. Both amazing and worth every last calorie. Through out the night the about three different staff members came over to help us and generally just to chat, they were great! Even the manager came over and was genuinely making an effort to greet all of his customers. We also ordered a number of different flavoured cocktails recommended to us by the bar tenders and each was unique and delicious in their own individual ways, they also didn't hold back on the spirits which can often happen during happy hour! Will definitely be returning ASAP as a special place to take friends I want to impress.",
