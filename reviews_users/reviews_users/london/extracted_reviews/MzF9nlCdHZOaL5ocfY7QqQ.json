YOu can sit on the street admiring the passers by here like you can in Italy and nor should you try to because the prices are far too high. Coffees are over 3 quid and if you want anything sweet youre much better off going to Maison Bertaux down the road.

It was packed with a big night crowd smiling and chatting and trying to order something from the Italian staff joking with them. A great atmosphere!

I am convinced that 5 lattes shouldn't cost \u00a325! It felt like pocket rape. Another friend of mine also said they felt ripped off by the place. Like all tourist attractions, they love ramping up the prices and I feel Bar Italia is doing that. It is a shame, given that the place is full of legend and the coffee is beautiful. If they stop playing with prices I will happily go there more often. But at present I only go there when it's the early hours and I am desperate for a latte.",

Famously a late-night haunt for people out in the west end who want a late bite to eat or a caffeine kick to keep them going even later, Bar Italia has seen it all and decided the best policy is to do what's been doing for years and years: serve good coffee, cakes and light bites at (fairly) reasonable prices. Tourists, local drunks, regulars, foreign students and londoners all flock here in droves to soak up the history or sit outside and people watch (probably the funnest place in london for this 21st century sport). To add to the atmosphere the staff are usually charmingly rude and speak in over-the-top italian-cockney accents. This is about as traditional as london gets so enjoy it whilst you can.",

It felt like my resident bar/coffee shop even if it was just my first time to go. True to the establishment name itself, Italy was spelled all over the place, The flags, the logos, heck even the famous celebs, are all about Italia and are naturally found all over the place. There's a huge LCD screen mounted for the TV aficionados, which I guess comes pretty handy during the must-not-miss huge sporting events. I ordered myself their special Italy hot chocolate, one of the best I've tried in the world and their specialty, tuna-tomato-cheese sandwich, which came in 4 small sandwiches.

This Soho standby is the perfect place (and the only place) to end a late night out or to run off to at 3am when you can't sleep and just want to leave the house. A bit on the pricey side and probably not the best latte in town, but as one of the few places actually open after midnight in London it's probably the best latte you'll get in the small hours. And thanks to the smoking ban, staying indoors is a bit more tolerable without the cloud of cigarette smoke hanging around your head. Be prepared for massive crowds at just about any time of day. That being said, its the sot of place you have to go at least once to form your own love/hate opinion of.",

    "text": "I'm going against the grain as this place has never had a review lower that 4 stars, so my two stars may be quite a slur. I feel quite justified though in giving Bar Italia a low mark and interestingly, people largely seem to visit here in the daytime, my experience comes from a nocturnal visit.We (the 6 people I went with) arrived there at around 11pm-ish and it was already busy and soon enough it got busier still, a lot of people for a relatively small place. It was at this point which one of our group left for the reason that Bar Italia was \"shit\"!The \"shit\" conclusion was reached for the reason that not only was it too crowded (that's not why I disliked the place) but there wasn't a comprehensive choice for drinks - \u00a0they have no beer taps, only bottled lager and spirits which isn't good for a late night club/bar and these cost more than a pint despite getting less liquid wonderment than in a pint.Also, the place was ridiculously warm (ridiculously warm! I wasn't the only one who felt the need to pop outside at intervals for 5 minutes a time to cool down) and with not much room to move within the establishment this did make the inside a humid place. Then there was the crap music (my personal view) and the bouncers who felt the need to assert themselves with meaningful stares and just a busy attitude. They should've relished the opportunity to take it easy as their wasn't a sign of trouble but the Men in Black needed to remind you that it was them in charge and there would be NO MISBEHAVING FOO! Unnecessarily cautious.It's \u00a35 to enter and that isn't the most expensive entry fee in the area but when there are so many other late night bars/clubs in the vicinity I don't think I'll be going back.Ciao, Ian",

Excellent, real Italian espresso, need I say more. Though I will say, the most expensive cup of coffee in the city.",

It is open until the early morning hours, and just the right place to stop by for a filling sandwich, creamy Italian dessert or simply a drink, especially after a night out on the town! The place is always bustling with all sorts of interesting clientele who pop in, just like everyone else who does, to enjoy the thriving atmosphere this joint has to offer. I like to sit on the seats just outside right by Frith street, to simply enjoy a spot of people watching, as you just never get bored!Sat under the outside heaters provided, I like sipping on their hot \u00a0chocolate, which is thick and creamy, as you would expect a good Italian hot chocolate to taste. They also have my favourite liqueur, Limoncello, which I occasionally enjoy having, and also packs a strong punch, but really does warm you up. Bar Italia has been around for sometime now, since 1949, and is still a constantly thriving, popular place to go to.",

I'm fairly certain that it should have been less than \u00a36 in most independent coffee shops, but I guess that's the price you pay for partaking of coffee in one of Soho's most established institutions. Cost aside, Bar Italia's a great place for people-watching and, more importantly, watching football games, especially if Italy happen to be playing. It's open 24 hours and is one of those places you can adjourn to after a long night out without being harassed. I've never been here for an alcoholic drink, but those coming here late at night should note the 'Bar' in 'Bar Italia' means a European bar, as opposed to an English bar, so no alcohol is served after 11 pm.",

Still to complain about the price would be to miss the point somewhat. It is one of the few places in London that always seems to be open. Often you find yourself there unintentionally after a night out sitting on a table or the curb amongst other people in a similar state of disrepair trying to engage in some debate or another. Also, last year I went and shook hands with Tim Westwood.Unsurprisingly, it also acts as something of a centre for the Italian community and is good fun whenever there's an Italian sporting event on.",

This place didn't disappoint. The coffee is great and there are several small televisions that play either: some euro-sport or (on good days) really bad euro-music video shows.The staff is great. Funny, but doing their own thing. You are there for their show. But no worries because they do make you feel right at home. If there's a seat outside, sit down.

    "text": "I wanted to love this place. I love, love, love Italy's bars, where you roll in, stand at the counter, order your espresso, pay your .80 Euro, brave minor burns on your hands from the ripping hot cup that has been sitting atop the espresso machine and minor burns in your throat from the boiling caffeinated bitterness that is legit Italian \"caffe.\" Perhaps you exchange pleasantries with the barista. The entire process takes five minutes max - ideally around two minutes and afterward, you feel alive again. This occurs all day, every day from Alto Adige to Sicily - Italy may be a hot mess of regional political and cultural divisions, but damn it, the coffee ritual unites the place! But I digress.We staggered in around 11:30 pm after way too much delicious Sichuan food at Barshu a few doors down. On the surface, this could be a bar in Italy - old-man-but-now-trendy tipples like Fernet Branca behind the counter, big espresso machine. But not really. We rolled up to the counter. A server intercepted us and made us look at a menu (why?). She promptly went away, even though we were set to order. When I asked for espresso, she gave me the \"Really?\" look, as though I should be ordering some mug full of milky BS like the other patrons. At 11:30 pm. Yes, I really wanted an espresso, and the message was eventually received. When the coffee finally came, after about five minutes, which is a reasonable wait time in a normal British cafe but would be considered an eternity at a bar in Italy - it tasted pretty good. Not de-fanged and insufficiently bitter like espresso at chains like Costa or Caffe Nero. But the cup was cold and the entire experience left me feeling cold to Bar Italia, especially since a single espresso costs \u00a32.60 and process took 15 minutes. That feels inherently un-Italian to me.Perhaps one needs to come here at 4 AM to understand the praises that Bar Italia's acolytes sing so loudly. Maybe I'll give it a try again sometime when out in Soho or in a fit insomnia/strange desire for a night bus adventure - yes, \u00a32.60 is un-Italian for a coffee, but not the end of the world if it turns out to be a bad investment. Maybe the \"element\" in the wee hours does serve to justify this place's cult following. But my first visit left a bad taste.",

    "text": "I simply love Bar Italia. It's one if these London institutions that one simply has to try out. In short: it's an Italian coffee bar that's open 24 hours. It's not necessarily cozy in there with plush sofas and plenty of seating \u00e0 la Starbucks. No, there's a counter with a giant espresso machine, a shelf displaying all kinds of snacks (think Portuguese custards, pannini sandwiches etc) and behind the counter there's a small army of Italian baristas (the non-hipster and genuine kind) who will serve you up your espresso drink in mere seconds. (This is also not a place where you should ask for complicated coffee concoctions \u00e0 la Starbucks - keep it simple and real.)Given that this is not a place to linger, I typically come here for a quick espresso before heading on to a next destination - whether it be the National Gallery, a musical or a bar nearby. In the summer though, you might be lucky and snatch one of the prime seats outside. That's actually quite fun, as you can watch and comment on the diverse Soho crowd parading by...",

    "text": "Everywhere I turned, I kept hearing that the best coffee in all of London was here. Perhaps, and this can happen, there was just too much hype. To make matters worse, it was a very rainy moment in the day and I was fairly soaked, but I tried to keep my head and spirits held high (... I used to work at Disney World, what can I say?).The charming gent over the counter was all smiles and attentive, and I instantly felt better, rain be damned. I ordered an Americano and an espresso (for my bf). He loved his, so I let my cool a bit and took a sip. Weirdly, just then, the hair on chest stood on end ... even in a downpour. It was strong, is my basic point here. Not bad, just reeeeeeeeeeeally effing strong, okay? So, if you like strong coffee, you're in luck. The place is also open 24 hours, so I'm all for that schedule. We went back the next evening for a post-pub piece of cake (chocolate), and it was great and filling - and again, with only mediocre service, which I can let slide as they must deal with a lot of slurring drunks at that hour. Additionally, they seem to love Rocky Marciano here (my third cousin, no kidding), based on the decorations, so I can't be that hard on them. Or can I?",

All the staff are Italian and all the food they serve is traditional Italian. They do hot food as well as cakes and sweet treats. They make proper good Italian coffees, the espressos are so good. The cannoli are delicious, even the staff devour them! There are seats outside to watch the world go by but the best thing to do is grab a seat at the long espresso bar inside and watch the interactions of the staff and step back in time and imagine you are in Naples. The coffee and cakes are expensive but totally worth it.",
