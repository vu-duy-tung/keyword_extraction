    "text": "Cracking! Dotori sits inconspicuously in between a Sri Lankan accountancy firm and Nigerian take away just outside Finsbury Park station. It's popularity has increased exponentially as the hipster contingent of Dalston & Hackney drifts towards better transport connections and cheaper rent...The \u00a323 set meal for two is great value and excellent quality. The starter salad has a special miso dressing (which you may be tempted to drink), the prawn tempura is expertly battered, the sushi is always fresh and delicious. For a main you can choose either a bento box or a bibimbap, both are generous and fun to eat.The staff are extremely friendly if a tiny bit organised, so it's advisable to get an earlier table in advance as this restaurant is chock a block every evening. I would highly recommend the green tea ice cream if you fancy dessert!",

A nice surprise miso soup which I wasn't expecting turned up at the table. I liked the price and portions that we got. Staff were friendly.",

It was missing minari (water dropwort) and ssukgat (edible chrysanthemum), both of which are staple ingredients in basic maeuntang, not to mention the substitution of enoki mushrooms with white mushrooms. Struggles.No complimentary banchan, which again, is standard for Korean restaurants in London, but you can hardly call any Korean meal authentic if it's not accompanied by some kimchi, at the very least (although I should mention that there was a little appetizer salad and I was given a couple orange slices with the check).Spice level was turned way down.I would have liked cold boricha (Korean barley tea) rather than green tea, but they didn't have it. :(All in all, this starving student left comfortably full, and my craving for Korean food was sufficiently quenched, although I'm still dreaming about my mom's home-cooked meals. Also, I have an inherent bias against places that serve both Korean and Japanese cuisine.",

For dinner we had the house roll, sashimi, and eel teriyaki.: -The house roll was good and decidedly non-fishy (it contained marinated beef and asparagus). -The sashimi was the usual fare. Salmon, tuna, and other types of fish served on daikon. Really nice and fresh, but would have been happier if they gave me enough wasabi to make my sinuses cry.-The eel teriyaki was a BEAST (but still a sweet and tender beast). A huge slab of grilled eel (think warm unagi) on a bed of bean sprouts. All very good and reasonably priced (if I recall correctly, everything listed above is under a tenner). Dotori also have an extensive menu of Korean dishes (really this place is more Korean than Japanese). Will have to check these out next time. Finally, they serve two beers here: Hite (Korean) and Asahi (Japanese).If you're looking for an anti-Yo-Sushi, this is it.",

    "text": "We had to go to the Finsbury Park area to run a couple of errands (involving suit fittings and buying cheese). We got off the train, and I was ready to find some food. So I turned to Yelp and realized that I hadn't had Korean food since moving from the Bay Area! I hadn't gone often, so I'm a bit of a Korean virgin, but I remembered liking what I had, so I thought why not?It's quite small, and it was incredibly busy for 2:30 in the afternoon on a Saturday. But we get a place to sit, and we order the Korean set menu for two (about \u00a313 a person) and green tea ice tea. The tea was really good. It was incredibly green looking, which creeped me out at first, but the taste was amazing. The set meal included five Korean small dishes (cucumber kim chee, seaweed, bean sprouts, some greens, and something else I didn't recognize) to start and all were very tasty. I would have preferred my kim chee to be a bit spicier, but the flavors were nice. Next they brought us some fried chicken in a sweet and spicy sauce and seafood pancakes. The chicken was a bit tough, but the flavor was amazing. The pancakes were probably my favorite part of the whole meal. Full of flavor and a great texture. Last, we had some bulgogi. Delicious!The service is a bit slow, but I think it was partly due to the place being packed. Anyway, if I'm ever back in the Finsbury Park area and want Korean, I'll be back! (Maybe we'll try some of the Japanese this time.)",

    "text": "I love this place! Have been coming here for Korean food since 2009. Have always lived walking distance and take all of our friends here for a guaranteed great meal. It's a family business and the consistency is incredible. I've lost count of how many times I've eaten here but it's always great. I've had both my birthday and my husband's birthday here with tables for 18 and despite being a tiny restaurant, they are always friendly and accommodating. They also serve Japanese food which is delicious but I think they excel in the Korean side of things. Highlights include the dumplings the rice sticks, the kimchi pancake, the mapo fried tofu, the fried tofu bento box, the deep fried and stir fried korean squid, the beef bulgoggi and the black sesame ice cream. They are super busy so it's rare that you'd ever get a table without booking but sometimes if it's just two of you they have room at the bar downstairs. They rarely pick up the phone which is annoying but keep trying because it's totally worth it! One of my favourite restaurants in London.",

    "text": "Recommended as a good option for dinner while in town. Stopped by to add our name to the waiting list as we were told it would be an hour wait (actually 90 minutes). Waited at a pub across the street as suggested. \u00a0We checked back a number of times and felt others were called in before us. \u00a0We finally got in at 9:30pm and escorted to the bottom section of the restaurant, small but happy to be sitting down. \u00a0Vibe was quiet but not bad, just not the same as upstairs.Our wait staff advised us that it would be 20-30 minutes add'l for any Sushi or Sashimi, which is what this restaurant is known for as well as Korean? \u00a0? ?OK, so we wait since we're highly invested now, we finally get very simple items: edamame (lacking rock salt), a roll, a few sashimi and soft shell crab. \u00a0The food was simply \"just\" OK but not worth 115 minutes of my life.All of the sudden @10:15 on Friday night, the wait staff drops the ticket on our table. We are not finished, called her over and asked why we have the bill. She says it's time to close & the Sushi chef turns off the works light. \u00a0We call the manager (who has a very uncaring attitude) and ask what's going on AS we just sat down? \u00a0He says that it was last call and we said we were not made aware of this. He reluctantly said OK & another staff member with even more attitude literally says nothing and drops the food on the table with no thank you, no enjoy your entree or did she bring any sauces.I try to avoid negative postings like this but I'm unsure how to improve this. The facts are the facts!!!The staff needs some classes in \"customer care\". \u00a0These guys clearly have more business then they know what to do with. \u00a0I will take my hard earned money to one of many other similar restaurants in the area,",

This is literally the cheapest place to have Korean and Japanese food, but the quality is absolutely amazing! Come as a group and order the set menu to share (which you can make moderations to) and add some of your favorite dishes. The bill came to \u00a365 for 5 people with drinks included. My personal recommendations include:- udon noodles (freshly made, not packet stuff)- bimibap (in a super hot bowl that makes the rice crispy)- tempura (the batter is just perfection)You should always book, but if you can't get through, then walk in might also an option for 2 people during non-peak hours.",

Every so often we'll try and get in for our standard order of Dubu Kimchi, Kkanpunggi and a Beef Donburi. Sometimes I'll go for sushi with some Unagi or a Dragon Roll. I can't fault this place at all really. It's really cramped, really REALLY hard to get them on the phone and it's really worth the effort. I just wish they had a place twice the size. They've expanded into the basement now which is great but they're still full every night. More power to them. Dotori is a really nice spot to have in Finsbury Park.",

The tofu was particularly good - sticky, sweet and spicy. As I went around the box trying bits of everything, I finally came to the last piece and bit into it, only to realise that it seemed a lot like meat. I looked more closely and then was sure of it - I'd been served deep fried chicken with my vegetarian bento box.I called a waiter over and asked what it was, and I could see the horror on his face as he started to explain that it was chicken. I told him I'm a vegetarian and had ordered a vegetarian meal. He left without saying anything and then another waiter came over to apologise. She brought me the beans that were supposed to have been in the box and my partner ate the chicken. Luckily, I'm not too squeamish so I was still able to eat the rest and found it delicious, but I was still completely horrified and just can't believe that they were careless enough to make a mistake like that. I would have given them one star were it not for the fact that the food was actually good, just completely careless and inappropriate service.",

I was told to wait and then had to wait a short while before seeing someone else, however, it was clear that everybody was rushed off of their feet. I was told that it would be a 30 minute wait for food but as I was only going to a place 5 minutes away I booked and came back later. Food was ready almost to the minute!As for what we ordered - we got a couple of donburi bowls which were more than enough food, neither of us finished. Even after being packaged up and transported for a few minutes, it arrived still fresh and tasty. The pork katsu was a good piece of meet and the beef Gyudon was also very tasty.Worth the long wait!",

After trying 4 times to get into Dotori (they seemed to be closed for forever during Christmas) we finally got in the front door only to find they were booked out for the whole night.Desperate to get a taste of this place we ordered a portion of japchae, ddeokbokki, bulgogi bibimbap, beef stew and a salmon teriyaki bento box to take away. While the ddeokbokki was ON POINT the rest was so disappointingly average. The bulgogi was rock hard, the japchae lacking the normal ompf, and the salmon was just ok.I will say that everything is fantastic value for money though especially the bento box (only \u00a312!) which also came with a box of prawn and veggie tempura - which I imagine would have tasted amazing at the restaurant but was kind of soggy after our 10 minute drive - and a plate of California rolls - which were actually pretty delicious. Maybe it would have been a different story if we had gotten a table but sadly this was not the taste of Korea we were hoping for.",

    "text": "Dotori has been a restaurant discussed excitedly within my circle of friends for ages. It was this mysterious Japanese restaurant with favourable reviews, \"somewhere in Finsbury Park\". Finally we decided to make a reservation (a must do!) and had a fantastic meal on a Saturday night. We arrived at 6:45pm and the place was over half full, with lots of Reserved signs dotted on the tables.We had vegetable gyoza and edamame to start, followed by sashimi, various sushi, some Korean BBQ and a tempura udon. The menu has equal options for both Japanese and Korean cuisines so there is definitely something for everyone. I've been to many great sushi places, coming from Vancouver, a place so many Japanese restaurants that I've lost count so I have a good feeling when a restaurant is \"legit\" and Dotori certainly is!The tempura was crisp and light, the udon soup tasted exactly as it should. The service was attentive and quick. The sushi was fresh, and fairly good value for the price. There are certainly more places in central London who charge more and you get less. They do takeaway so if you live nearby, it's a good way to skip the queue. By the time we finished, there was a queue by the door but I'm not sure if they were walk-ins.",

When we first arrived, the small little restaurant was packed, and they kindly let me know it'd be about a 20 minute wait so we decided to go grab a drink elsewhere and come back. With Korean and Japanese on the menu, I went with ordering a Shrimp Tempura Crunch roll, Bulgogi Bibimbap, Dakbulgogi, and Jap Chae. The crunch roll was very good, and the great thing was that it tasted very fresh, which is always a plus. The Jap Chae was okay, not exactly sure what was off about it but it needed a little something. The bibimbap was very tasty, however, Bibimbap in Soho beats them on this one in my opinion. The Dakbulgogi was delicious. Succulent chicken drenched in spicy sauce, I love it. We also ended the dinner on a good note by getting some green tea ice cream.Overall, a lovely place with very good food. A bit out of my way, but if I'm ever craving some Korean, Dotori is a nice spot to go to.",

    "text": "Super quick service with incredibly accommodating staff seeing I hadn't booked in advance and was trying to grab a quick bite before a gig. They fitted me in and were happy for me to have the table for a good hour. Not needed as the food was in the table in less than 10minutes of me ordering! Excellent presentation, pretty tasty, very hearty and all for under \u00a38! (50p card charge if your bill is under \u00a310). Now to dash to the gig!",

    "text": "Last night I ate at Dotori for the second time.It's a little place just around the corner from Finsbury Park tube station. It doesn't look much from the outside - I'd walked past it many times and never intended to visit until recommendations from friends and Timeout started popping up.You can't phone and book - the number online goes to a full mailbox and no one picks up, ever!They are great at trying to squeeze you in, though you may feel like you're dining with the people on the table next to you.The food is very tasty, although I haven't eaten Korean anywhere else so I don't haveva comparison.Both times I've had the raw beef and egg Bibimbap. They bring it in a sizzling bowl and stir it in in front if you so the beef and egg cooks into the rice and vegetables at your table.The spicy pork belly from the Korean BBQ section delicious and the portion size enough for 3 people to easily share.We tried the Chinese cabbage kimchi which I personally wasn't a fab of - there are much tastier things on the menu to eat.We opted for plum wine to accompany our meal.You can order Korean or Japanese. The sushi menu looks quite extensive and the bento boxes yummy, though I've stuck to just Korean food both times I've eaten there.Oh, based on my first visit I'd really recommend the meat dumplings.Dinner for two, with wine cost just under \u00a340.The staff are helpful and friendly, but busy squeezing through a packed place with a non stop flow of diners seeking tables, even on a Tuesday night.I will defiantly continue to eat here!",
