Trying to be a clicky, destination bar in Bethnal Green is a difficult proposition.If you want to be chic, d\u00e9cor is important. BBB is stunning on the eye and has a warm, romantic feel. Every room is stunning in its own right. Whether you are just dining or drinking or using the gallery room or cocktail lounge, you feel bathed in luxury. \u00a0This has to be backed up with sustenance and I think this is where BBB is lacking.The service can be hit and miss and the staff don't seem to genuinely care. I asked for a Spiced Pear Daiquiri from the bartender and it was rather bland. Cocktail bartenders have to love making cocktails. I didn't see that love. The interaction from the staff just wasn't there. I get the feeling that they think the stunning surroundings are enough. Sadly for them it is not.",

Also, we didn't eat in the restaurant upstairs, this is purely based on our bar experience.So here we go: - the bar manager was the most hopeless I've ever come across. She was rude, disorganised, inexperienced and barely able to carry a tray of drinks. - they borked our private table reservation and weren't apologetic about it - the waiter asked us to 'move our sh*t' (our bags and coats) after we'd only been there 5 minutes. We'd not decided whether to hang about long enough to bother with the weirdly Chanel branded, and undoubtedly extortionate, cloakroom. - 4 cobras were 20 quid. - the guys mixing drinks were very impressive. The cocktails looked lovely. - it was chock-full of suity types. The shoreditch haircut crew clearly can't afford to drink here anymore. - avoid.",

It's clearly inspired by the excessive, baroque and kitch style of its neighbour Les 3 Garcons (or even Loungelover which is just behind it) but still this big open space has been developed very creatively. Big 60's pendant lights, black and gold wallpapers and carpets, yellowish lighting, marble central bar, rough wood panels, used leather sofas, classic French chairs all black, a lot of gold and shinny materials to contrast with the dark floor, ceiling and outdoor paint. So go there for a drink around the bar but really dont bother to stop for food as the menu is not only disappointing but also very thin and expensive. We had the brunch menu which listed 8-10 courses with nothing very enticing, including a \u00a316 burger The service is ok, friendly but not very pro. So enjoy the aperitif, before or after Loungelover.",

The food was pretty good, my entire table got the sea bass or the tortellini from the set menu. My favourite was a delicious Eton Mess (though I guess it would be hard to get that wrong, really).

    "text": "The name may be a little odd and some of the surrounding area less than salubrious but once inside this old Victorian warehouse it's like being transported to another realm. It was a bit like stepping into the wardrobe in the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and seeing Narnia spread out in front of you. The decor is luxurious, opulent, decadent and grand. I had worried that I would find it a little pretentious but even having booked a sought after booth and then turning up half an hour late we were greeted with a smile and politely shown to our table. We poured over the menu whilst chatting for quite a while but weren't rushed at any point. Having dinner with a couple of girlfriends meant we bypassed the starter and opted for a cocktail instead. Porn Star Martini's all round which at \u00a39.50 each isn't cheap but it was possibly the nicest one I'd ever had. They have a lovely selection of wines, most of which are way out of my price range but we settled on a rose to satisfy the none red/none white drinkers. For the seriously flash they offer the Cristal Brut, Louis Roederer 1985, a snip at \u00a32300. If you prefer a younger model they have the 2002 at only \u00a3400! Just reading the food menu is a mouth watering experience and even drew silence on our table for at least a minute or so whilst we pondered on delights such as Chateaubriand, Piri Piri Lime & Chilli Chicken and Pan Fried Fillet of Sea Bass. Being sensible we all opted for a different salad, but this was by no means the healthy option, for example I had the Crispy Duck and Watermelon salad. This wasn't a bowl of leaves with the odd morsel of crispy duck...oh no. This was chunky pieces of melon with a huge pile of crispy duck on top with not a lettuce leaf in site. Although my friends had food envy over my dish the dishes they chose were similarly light on the rabbit food effect. Having chosen wisely we even had room for dessert. Eaton Mess wins out every time and their take on it was delightful. Throughout dining the service was pleasant, polite and attentive. Having finished our meals we left our table whilst waiting for the bill but took longer than expected to return. On doing so we had been replaced by new diners, even though our bill was sat, unpaid, on the table. We spotted the waiter and he seated us at the bar whilst we settled the bill but we pointed out that there had been some wine left and we had intended to finish it (it cost us enough after all!). As the table had been cleared away he was very apologetic and we were all given a complementary glass of champagne. Considering we were quite thoughtless in having all left the table at the same time I thought this was an incredibly nice gesture on their part. Beach Blanket Babylon is housed over three floors. I believe there is a gallery on the first floor but I didn't venture that far. We ended our night in the basement which is home to a bar. I found this a little disappointing as the opulence of the restaurant hadn't been continued through to the basement. It felt more like a bar in a ski resort. The 'CHANEL' sign over the cloakroom had a whiff of cheese about it and I half expected to find Gluhwein being sold behind the bar, it made the name of the place appear even odder after this. If I visit Beach Blanket Babylon again it will be on the strength of the food and service but I'll probably nip over the road to Loungelover for after dinner drinks. Apparently Madonna held her birthday party here and I bet that wasn't at all cheesy.",

It pulls an eclectic and interesting crowd (even by Shoreditch standards)... read fantastic people watching. The first drop in was after dinner on a weeknight at Les Trois Garcon next door. BBB was crowded, but not packed and the service was efficient. The interior is open (warehouse feel) and trendy-chic. Drink quality was fine; had a standard Sapphire and Tonic tough to screw up. There was a group of club kids milling about who were artistically and provocatively dressed (and some in various states of undress)... kind of like what I imagine Warhol's entourage looked like back in the day. The scene made a striking backdrop for drinks and was far more edgy than the BBB crowd in Notting Hill.Second visit was a complete disappointment. Stopped in on a Saturday night and there was a criminal lack of bar staff. We tried both the upstairs and downstairs' bars and were not in the mood to join the ranks of other punters bitterly waiting for even eye contact with overwhelmed bartenders. I hope this was a one-off and that some of their staff had the flu. Otherwise the management needs to get a clue. They could have been making considerably more money by keeping up with the masses' unfulfilled demand for booze. We chose to leave and wander to another bar that was staffed appropriately. This experience is why I couldn't give it more than three stars. If I stop in again and have such a poor experience, I'll be revising my rating down to two stars.",

However, I was there for a business trip and during dinner, my purse was stolen. \u00a0I had placed my purse right next to my chair and was not close to anybody else or any other table. \u00a0I had thought to place my purse between my feet under the table but at the least minute decided not to because I was being paranoid. \u00a0This looked like a higher end restaurant with a clientele who didn't seem into or interested in purse snatching.

I was later told by a bartender at a nearbye bar that theft is a big issue in this area. \u00a0Beach Blanket Babylon is not the only place in Shoreditch which has this issue. \u00a0On one hand, that's life and I would shrug it off as a lesson learned.

    "text": "My first ever one star review, I have been saving it for an exceptionally terrible experience. I once discussed this with someone and I explained that for me somewhere would need to be a number of things wrong with a place and also bad service that was clearly not limited to only one staff member for it to merit my one star review. And in this respect beach blanket Babylon sure delivered. Some of the lovely yelpers I was with have already reviewed the place and outlined the poor service from the outset, the unappetising and unsatisfying food which was overpriced - I have never had whitebait before and this may have put me off trying it again but it was the mash that was most upsetting! For me there is usually good mash or great mash, I have never come across the bad type before! I am still amazed at how it was possible to make such a simple dish so badly, it was watery! The portions were extremely stingy also (although somehow we still left food I think and we were all sharing- and hungry-I think that says something right there). The drinks for me were the only non terrible part of the experience (other than the exceptional company but that has no bearing on the review!) but they were only ok not great and overpriced. The service however surpassed my expectations of what is needed for a one star review. Not only was every staff member we came across equally as unhelpful as the next, they also came across as disdainful towards us from the moment we arrived (was it my Christmas jumper do you think?) and very, very slow considering that they were not full and that they wanted us to leave as soon as we sat down. I do understand that more and more places are offering time limited places and am happy to be made aware of this, but not this many times! They would come over just to tell us that we needed to leave but when we used that opportunity to order something they would disappear. I was even wearing a watch and can remember things like my own name and so I feel that being told this many times that we only had 2 hours at the table is unnecessary. It didn't help that 3 separate staff members were all coming over to tell us just this (and rarely with anything that we had ordered in their hands). The cherry on the cake of this experience was the fact that when we saw the 15% service charge on the bill some of us felt that not paying it may be an opportunity to let them know that the service had been substandard, the staff member taking payment didn't seem to understand the optional element of this and so it became awkward and I don't remember if everyone did but I ended up paying mine to make it easier. I know I could have probably stood my ground but not only did it become awkward I also reasoned that it was a small price to pay to be able to leave. I am glad that we came here, I now know that I never want to come again. I now appreciate the great places that we went before and afterwards that much more. And I realised that it is possible for me- the type of person who is always looking for the positives to actually have a true one star review worthy experience.",

My colleagues ordered drinks upon being seated and it took 45 minutes before anyone received a single drop. \u00a0Let me say that a little louder for the kids in the back.FORTY-FIVE MINUTES FOR A COCKTAIL TO ARRIVE AT THE TABLE.I was blown away. \u00a0Dumbfounded. \u00a0Shocked. \u00a0Puzzled. \u00a0Bemused, betrayed, bewildered. \u00a0All of the above. \u00a0My food was ok, but a 30-40 minute interval between each course left me wanting more. \u00a0I specifically ordered my salmon cooked rare and received cat food. Overall, I just had this immense feeling of \"meh\". \u00a0Had I been the one paying for it, I would have been angry. Additionally, they separated our group of 20 into two tables and luckily my table wasn't the one that didn't get any food for another hour after receiving cocktails. \u00a0:/Then, around 11pm, the lights dimmed and they turned on these awful club-esque strobe lights and started playing really bad pop music. \u00a0And then I left.Because there's so many cool places to check out in this area, I won't be back. \u00a0But I would like to leave on one positive note: \u00a0the decor (strobe lights not included) is pretty damn cute.",

Not sure what the interior designers were smoking when they put together this concept but it worked for me. Wot i can say is, you will love it or hate it.What you may not realise whilst here is that there is a Restaurant, Bar, Mezzanine, 2 Cocktail bars & a Gallery where the East End Film Festival has made an appearance. All this contained within three floors including a basement with the obligatory DJ slotspot and a VIP area. Quelle surprise!! Rumour has it their New Years bash is something else so if you haven't made plans yet then maybe ....but ...as with any place of this genre how you feel about it ultimately depends on the service you will receive and I have had two visits which were vividly contrasting as a result of how busy it was and where we chose to park up. Go early in the evening on a weekday if you want to get the best experience. \u00a0They get a big thumbs up for the Allan Gage inspired cocktails but a massive thumbs down for the food, it is bleh at best!",

    "text": "Oh man, I was excited to review Beach Blanket Babylon because I had a good time, but there's nothing as sweet as getting that \"first\" badge with it!So as I mentioned, I had a really good time here. Even counting falling up the stairs and being completely unable to find a cab home (that second bit was the result of stubbornness, while the first was just a matter of stupidity). Drinks are strong (and priced high as a result), the music is great, and they have plenty of bar space. The only complaint I have is that it can take forever to flag down a server to get a drink.The upstairs was where friends and I enjoyed the vaulted ceilings and cool decorations. The downstairs area seemed fun too, though I wasn't down there long. Lots of dancing, a few more dark corners to tuck into. It's a really trendy option on the East Side, with plenty of spaces for big groups. I'd definitely go back, and it's on the shortlist for my birthday party, so that's definitely a compliment to them.",

And the music was fun and oldschool - great for a lowkey, dance-filled night out! The food, however, was so so. We were a fairly large party as we were out to celebrate a friend's birthday so we had to do the set menu. Everything sounded delicious, but something didn't quite come together in the kitchen. As my starter, I had the baked goat cheese cake with a walnut and basil dressing and it was fairly dry. For my main, I had the miso marinated seabass and it was absolutely delicious - only wish it came with more bok choy. And last but not least, the pannacotta for desert - a bit too thick for my liking and the berry topper a bit too tart for my liking, but a decent desert.",

High notes include the cocktails, as mentioned, and a well judged, well balanced menu, and friendly staff from the door staff on in. Slight bum notes include occasionally slow service \u00a0beware if you're in a big group ordering lots of different drinks before your meal ( they'll likely arrive after your food), and a tendency to somewhat overcook red meat. A grilled goats cheese starter, and twice cooked belly pork were very good \u00a0coffee was a somewhat bitter ( but you really won't be here for that anyway). Starters around 6-8 pounds, mains 16-25.******************************As an addendum, we had a rather disappointing staff Christmas party here \u00a0the goats cheese tart starter was vile ( think off Wensleydale on a stale digestive), portions were tiny, and the service was haphazard and confused. For example, if a table orders champagne ( I know, times are tough), is it too difficult to understand that it should arrive before other wine ?",

    "text": "A tricky one. The ground floor (which is all I saw of the place) is very opulent and clearly quite a lot of money has been spent fitting this place out. The cocktails all looked lovely and the bar food is pretty nice. However, it is pricey, service is slow and they add a very naughty 12.5% to your bill as an 'optional gratuity' but if you don't spot it before you've handed over your card it's too late to opt out. My friends ordered a bottle of wine and a couple of bar snacks at the bar and they paid a hefty \u00a35 gratuity for the bar man to hand over the bottle and a couple of glasses. A waitress took \u00a310 from me for a glass of house wine (about \u00a36) and never returned with my change. When questioned she told me someone within my group (but on a completely seperate bill) had underpaid and so I'd compensated for it which seemed a bit shady. Perhaps an unfair judgement as I visited on a Tuesday night but the place was very quiet and lacked any real atmosphere. Maybe on a Thursday / Friday / Saturday it's a bit more lively. But I'd dread to think what the service is like if it's packed as they barely seem able to cope when the place is practically empty. I wouldn't refuse to return but definitely not my first choice for a future night out.",

Scallops for starters were cooked and seasoned to perfection, a healthy sized portion of a 'side' salad was a refreshing surprise and duck with mash for the main was scrumptious. And it was hard to pick a dish from the menu, which has an ample supply of delicious choices without being too cluttered.The food menu deserves a few extra words. If you want a reasonably priced dish you can find it. A burger with fries for about \u00a312.95 (a la the Ivy don't you know) or linguine, cannelloni or risotto are all reasonably priced and sound delicious. For mains, you also have two choices of sea bass, seared for one or grilled if you are two and willing to share. There are a few meaty dishes for two to share on the menu which I would love to go for if I head back with someone with the appetite for it. \u00a0Some special starters too like the scallops or a plate of mussels. My regret is I can't head back soon for more, and that I skipped dessert which was also very tempting, in particular the apple and rhubarb crumble served with custard, eton mess is also on the menu and always a winner (all \u00a37.50). \u00a0No comments on the wine menu though as it was a mineral water evening. The staff were friendly, pleasant *and* attentive. That was lovely. \u00a0The \u00a0soft furnishings are, despite appearing pretentious, conducive to allowing you to make what you want of your evening, be it a long chilled out session, a loud one or a quick bite (the food arrived quickly - double bonus). \u00a0No rushing in or being rushed out on the evening I was here.There were a few corporate suits but that is inevitable in this neighbourhood on a Wednesday evening, and alas still no celeb spotting despite claims to the contrary (but really, who cares).I'd dine here again if I was in the neighbourhood.Enjoy.x",

I order a lychee chili cocktail which was very pleasant. We then waited another hour for our starter. I ordered sardines and hated them. They were so boney, which is partly my fault because I should really have ordered the pear salad, I thought I would just try something different. When the main came they served our steaks to the wrong people. As I tucked in I realised my medium rare steak was actually well done. I proceeded to eat it anyway as I couldn't be bothered to wait again. However, my friend was really not happy with his steak being medium rare. The waitress was called over and her response was 'can't you swap all the plates around'!!!! My friend said he wanted a new one but I swapped and ate his. He waited another half an hour for his food. We were offered some free shots as a compromise but by this stage I felt it was a case of too little too late. Their mac and cheese was dry as a bone, it was like they'd run out of cheese. The rest of the food was just average, nothing to write home about, and certainly nothing to justify the extortionate amount of money we paid (\u00a368 each!!!). We also spotted some rat traps by the toilets on the way to the toilet. I also hate having someone in the toilet to sell my aftershave and hand me a towel. I find it really irritating. The only positives were the great music they played and the environment is lovely. and trendy. Overall a terrible experience. Don't go.",

Complete with haughty waiters who seem vexed by your presence even when you are the only people in the whole place and over-done girls with hair extensions and heels almost as tall as the ceilings. It's somewhere between a cocktail bar and a night club but not really working either angle. The cocktails are weak and expensive for the area....around 12 a pop Wine was also pricey. I wouldn't really have food here...apparently they do a brunch.

When we got to the restaurant, we were told they had to switch to usual menu. Really? We make a reservation a month early and you can't even prepare enough portions? Anyway...yThe food was ok, the Pornstar martini really tasty, but... that is it. BBB is presented as something decadent but is trying too hard. And our waitress, not very pleased with costumers, the other stuff friendly and helping though.",

    "text": "I visited Beach Blanket Babylon for dinner. Ordered a regular burger but unfortunatly didn't meet my expectations. The bread was white bread like the one from supermarkets, no sauce at all; just a slice of tomato, a slice of cheese (not even melted) and a slice of meat (no juicy at all) - the most dry burger I have ever eaten. Chips were just chips. Not suggested at all for food. Service on the other hand was excellent. Interiors are quite nice - dark place with huge comfy sofas. The music is quite loud and the place all the time noisy.",

The waiter who served us was really nice but we came in without a reservation and unfortunately they had to push some other people out for us to get seated, which shouldn't happen in my opinion. The food took a very long time to arrive, around an hour of waiting. I ended up getting the Mac and cheese, hoping it would be something special since I had to pay 10\u00a3 for it. It wasn't. The people I went with was really pleased with the beef rump, so maybe that's a better option. The music was also really strange for a place that serves food. Way too loud and made it seem more like a club.",

    "text": "Brunch is not really a \"thing\" here. So, whenever I see it advertised on a blackboard outside a restaurant...I get a little excited. Plus, no one else really goes to \"brunch\" so it's not ever really too crowded (unless you are trying to go have an American brunch at Breakfast Club, where it is really crowded...some things just go together!) -- which always satisfies me as I detest waiting, and love coffee immediately. We popped into BBB for B on a Sunday morning before lolling about Shoreditch. It's a big space, and surely has quite a vibrant night scene...but during the day they flip the lights on and grab a juicer and we've got some brunch going on. And it's a pretty suitable one, at that. A lot of elbow room at a banquette probably usually reserved for small girls in small skirts and overpriced bottle service...but hey hey, I'm getting jiggy with an Americano and some eggs over here. Ah, the eggs. I had them with smoked salmon on english muffins. It was exactly as described, no more...no less. Two english muffins, side by side on a plate, scrambled eggs carefully perched and then piled with a few pieces of smoked salmon. It was tasty -- though not inventive, but surely did the trick. A garnish or something to set it apart might do wonders. Perhaps butter? I'm not sure, needs a little sumpin'. My dining partner had the Full English breakfast and commented that he \"could definitely come back and have it again, especially if hungover\" because the place didn't annoy him. Because it was silent and pretty empty...but again, it's a club trying to do some breakfast so it makes sense. His fare was standard but both served quickly. Our service was great. Got off to a slow start, as I saw many men scurrying around...but around us. Not to us. So we waited awhile for coffee, but then it was well made and so I was happy again. Steamed milk with an Americano, always a winner. So for under 30 quid we were caffeinated, fed, not annoyed with any ques and had some friendly service. Would I hurry back? Probably not, but it'll remain on my roster as a good place to bring my husband when I want to go out for breakfast and not deal with a bad attitude. Just give him a Full English and he's a new man!",

    "text": "This is probably one of the worst places in London. We came in with a six pm reservation on a Saturday night. The guy at the desk took off for awhile. Not sure why. But we were shown our seats.Where we were told that we only had the table for two hours. We were like, it won't be a problem, thanks. We ordered drinks. I asked for the least sweet cocktail on the menu. The waiter then proceeds to point out every cocktail that has sugar as an added ingredient. Moron.So we weren't dressed like we were some sort of TOWIE rejects with matching hair, orange skin and clothes. And that means we're horrible people who deserve bad service at a place like this. The food was also mediocre at best. We only ordered snacks, but we had some oily fried whitebait, some pretty boring chips and truffle mash. It was probably the worst mash I ever had. It was like someone just mashed potatoes with a little bit of truffle oil. No cream. No butter. And they were grainy. Who thinks grainy mash should leave the kitchen?Then to top it all off, we were reminded we only had an hour left of our table. At this point I wanted to tell the waiter to F-off. But instead we just decided to leave. And then had a 15% service charge added to the bill. Yep they add 15% here. For some of the worst service in London.Oh, and apparently they feel the need to feel posh by putting an attendant in the bathroom that I'm supposed to pay to get my paper hand towel? When the guy is just sitting in there reading a book? I don't think so. On top of it all, it seemed like the guy in toilet was the only black employee they had. Hooray for racism!",

    "text": "This place is actually vile. It's as if Shoreditch recognized that all these Essex people were pouring onto its streets on a Saturday night and they had no place to house them for dinner. POOF! Beach Blanket Babylon was cloned out of a place in west London and plonked down here. Why do I say cloned? Because it is such a try hard 'fancy' place \u00a0which is completely out of sync with its surroundings. It's straight out of an episode of TOWIE. \u00a0Imagine high ceilings with gilt and oversized mirrors everywhere. 'Glamorous' soft furnishings and people in the toilets to hand you paper towels and expect a quid in return. We were sat next to a table of identically overly made up blondes in all the same dresses and hair. It was laughably absurd. The whole place is. So so trying to be west London in east London down to the pornstar martinis on the menu. The reason I say trying to be fancy is because it just isn't, the drinks are bad and if you wanted to throw \u00a3100 down somewhere in this part of town, there are places with real bartenders making amazing cocktails. The menu is exactly what someone sat down and dreamed up as 'fancy' but got it all wrong. A tumblr of prawns for \u00a313, which turned out to only have 3 prawns. Shoestring fries which they told us actually were just chips. Chateaubriand and lobster for \u00a395. For the love of god, who would come here for a steak?We ordered a bunch of sides and they were just dire. Overcooked chips, undercooked truffle mash and whitebait which I am still tasting in my mouth. Bleagh! They give you bread with that, which is why I've given them one star. The cocktail menu was fine, very uninspired but not too overpriced at \u00a39.50 a pop. I had a mango and gin slim, but was basically just mango. Andrew had what he called the worst old fashioned of his life. The worst part of this whole place is the rude, entitled service staff. Our waiter was incredibly rude and kept reminding us we only had the place for two hours, that we were already late, not enough of our party was there and then came by later to tell us we had an hour left. \u00a0The waitresses serving the table were also extremely rude, slamming down plates and dragging them away from us. All this and they automatically charge 15% service.Do not go here.",

Luckily this time when I arrived it was during happy hour which was a pleasant surprise. The bartender explained what the deal was and we decided on 2 cocktails and a snack from the bar menu for the princely sum of \u00a315. The tempura jumbo prawns were good and there were 5 good sized prawns in the portion although the accompanying sauces were a little bit uninspiring. The 2 cocktails we got were pretty much a hit and an almost. We both went for a rum option and they packed a punch . The Walk in Shoreditch is the one I would recommend. The only reason we didn't work our way through the menu was because we had a dinner reservation we had to get to otherwise my memory of the drinks may have been a little bit more hazy!The service was absolutely fantastic with our bartender chatty and knowledgeable even though she was a little bit rushed. The whole establishment is maybe a little pretentious however nothing that hindered my night either time. Overall I'd say it was well worth a trip during happy hour however maybe best avoided outside of those times.",

I will never fully recover my eyesight and will need more operations in the future.This place deserves no stars because they was grossly negligent and completely incompetent for reasons we can only assume to protect their own license: they did not report the injury to the police, let the perpetrator and witness go, asked my friend that night to sign a waiver of responsibility, and claimed that I perpetrated an 'attack' that led to 'my own injury.' Thank you for ruining my sight and for dismissing all responsibility. I will now never find justice because of you. You are terrible, terrible people.(And finally to the girl who did this to me, thank you so much for running away. Good luck to your moraless life and I hope everyday karma will hit you back)",

Probably our worst life-experience.You can read the review below this one (Joy L.) for the details, but basically my girlfriend got glassed in her eye here in December. Besides the fact that no CCTV was available on the basement floor (with such a crowded dark place, I might understand why this would be quite useless), it was the complete lack of professionalism, competence and help you would expect from a place like this. The bouncers and manager did not question anybody, did not take any details from the people who saw the person who did this (although in all the panic we requested that from them), did not call the police, did not file this case ... They even just put us in the cold stairway while awaiting the ambulance without any aid.My girlfriend's sight and eye is damaged for the rest of her life and although they could not have prevented that, they were completely inadequate to handle this situation in any professional and helpful way. Because of them, we'll never know who did this and can never ask for any compensation.",
