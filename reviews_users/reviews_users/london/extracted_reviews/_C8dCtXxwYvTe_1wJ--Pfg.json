Just off Curtain Road in a courtyard this bar be located. In decent weather this doubles the capacity of the bar, or rather shifts it as most people like to enjoy the ambience outside. Although the pubs are very different, the courtyard hidden away from an otherwise bustling area of London reminded me of the courtyard outside The George (qype.co.uk/place/58056-T\u2026) in the London Bridge area. But to be worth such a high rating, it needs more than just a nice area outside surely? What about the British Winter. OKthrow in possibly the best Juke box selection I have ever seen (admittedly a lot of stuff from my era so perhaps not for everyone), some comfortable sofas inside to recline upon, a drinks selection that is off the beaten track and a wallet friendly food menu (having eaten therethey are not going to win any Michelin starsits just basic pub grub, but that's what you want and you shouldn't expect more at such a reasonable price). They also have live music here (what?...there's more?) in the otherwise chilled downstairs bar, whereas the upstairs bar is more restauranty (hey, if cupboardy is a word!) in it's feel. I expect to be back here on a fairly regular basis.",

Not sure if it was related, so I went ahead and gave it another shot yesterday.I met a friend on his lunch break from work. It was a sunny day, so the outside tables were busy. We ordered and were told there was a 20min wait. We figured that was ok. 45-50min later there was no food. My friend left money for his lemonade, canceled his burger, and had to go back to work. I got my burger 5 min later. The food is fine, but there's nothing special about it that I cant get elsewhere. So two experiences have let me down a bit. I'm pretty easy going, so I'll still probably go back at some point -- but for drinks only.",

It was originally a private club attached to the recording studios next door (still there and on the same website), tucked down a little cobbled entrance off Curtain Road. (There was much excitement at work when Oasis were spotted hanging out here, and presumably using the recording studios at the time.) And since it opened to the general public, it's proved very popular and you'll often find a pair of bouncers on the door in the evenings. Split over two levels, there's a DJ booth and dance floor downstairs, and a bar and tables upstairs. It's usually open until 2am, so you can dance away until the wee hours. In the daytime, it makes a good retreat from the hubbub of Shoreditch and there are tables outside for when the sun shines!",

Until then, it's the perfect place to hang out. It's a huge open kinda warehouse space. Two floors, but the top floor seems nicer in the day, it's lighter and airy. They have comfy battered old sofas and I could have sat there all day. The staff are kind and they made me a yummy hot chocolate. For a POUND! Really! It was in a tiny cup but it was yummy and quite rich so I wouldn't have wanted to drink anymore. And it was a pound! This made us sneak a peak at the rest of the menu. You can buy a veggie brekkie in here for less than three quid. Blimey. I don't know if they have free wi-fi in here, I should have asked. The whole of Shoreditch is going free wi-fi anyway soon which will be nice. This is the perfect creative place to work. I'm looking forward to popping down here with my laptop and books and for once, I might actually get some work done. They have bands on in the evening and djs and cool things. They've got art on the walls and a great selection of indy music mags. It's fun here. I intend to pop back and see what it's like after dark too.",

My original review gave this place 4 stars (you can read below) but now it's just become one of those places with a more strict doorman policy \u00a0just for a bar. Have been going to this place for years and now, doormen won't let 4 guys in together (even though we explained we were gay). I guess it has become yet another Shoreditch bar that has become a victim of being found. So we went to The Griffin and had a blast. This was my original review: As a bar this is a great place (have never eaten here). Great courtyard area for a drink and the music inside is indie/rock. If in the Shoreditch area and you want a place away from the tourists, it's a great place. No hen/stag parties welcome which is a good thing in my opinion. Mainly indie rock people and a good jukebox and/or djs if there is a party happening. Very laidback!",

The bar is so tiny, separated in two levels with a Juke Box, comfy sofa's, great burgers and a relaxed vibe. Strong Rooms gives off the vibe of chilling in your living room, it's very chilled and very cool. You can wear anything from converse to twelve inch heels, you don't have to pay to get in and you can spend you're whole night there sitting and chatting. Music is not a main feature in Strong Rooms, although once one has consumed enough alcohol I'm sure one may dance. The last time I went to Strong Rooms me and my friend arrived at seven in the evening, I ordered myself a Mozzarella, Tomato and Pesto burger mmm \u00a0it was absolutely delicious and only cost me six pounds, we chilled for a while, then my other friends came down and then at about eleven o clock my partner turned up and we literally mucked about and drank until two o clock, which is closing time.

I chose both times to escape upstairs and hang around the bar. They have friendly hipster bartenders and what looks like a tasty food menu. The courtyard outside is the perfect place in Shoreditch to hang out, it's huge and right on Curtain Road.

Returned here a few weeks ago for an Arrested Development marathon in the basement loungey area, and since we stayed there for a total of 10 hours, I figured I now knew it well enough to merit a review.The good:-Good selection of European beers \u00a0(Belgian, German, Czech - you name it!) , both on tap and in bottles-Friendly, helpful, lovely staff (especially when we were having ridiculous technical difficulties setting up the projector and they did everything they could to {successfully!} help us)-Spacious indoor area on two levels, with two bars when the place is in full swing. Plus, the outdoor picnic table seating area is really great, and has heat lamps near each so they can be in use all year round-The menu is inventive and changes weekly, because food here is done with fresh and local ingredients...usually.The bad:-The kitchen exploded (?...) on the day we went, so no food from there. Luckily, there was an outdoor BBQ going on that day which was at least edible-The downstairs area is a weird little grotto that turns into a dance floor at nighttime. It has concrete walls, sticky floors, and rather suspect leather couches with numerous unknown substances seeped into their surfaces. It is hence probably best left as a dance floor, and not a site for a movie marathon. The ugly:-The toilets. Hold it if you can. If you can't, you're better off finding a grassy patch in the picnic area to relieve yourself (I take no responsibility if you are apprehended for lewd and lascivious acts)",

I cannot rave enough about the food quality for the price we pay...Other things that make the place so great of course are -great music-as for the bar, great choices of drinks. I drink cider and they have great choices compared to most bars.-Staff is lovely and big couches make the place oh-so-cosy.-There's a great courtyard (heated in winter)Conclusion: Go, you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "At one time an ever so slightly hedonistic bar where you were just as likely to see Emma Bunton and Will Young slumming it with the original Shoreditch crowd as you were to see Liam Gallagher propped up at the bar, the Strongroom bar has in recent years been refurbished and stripped of much of its idiosyncrasy and in turn, for me at least, some of its original appeal.Seeing the once legendary Strongroom bar redecorated, stripped of its original Jamie Reed - of Sex Pistols fame - motifs and largely of its character is a sad and disappointing sight on par with seeing Johnny Rotten appearing on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. It shouldn't have happened but it has. Regardless, this is an interesting Shoreditch venue steeped in - recent - history, with friendly staff, a beautiful paved outdoor area with seating which is lush during the Summer, and a recording studio upstairs which lends the Strongroom a certain cultish appeal.",

You certainly get served with far more civility than so many of the generic Old Street offerings. Cocktails here are unusual but not particularly inspired (French Martini has a tendency to have the consistency of soup), but this is still a secluded spot which definitely harks back to the days when Shoreditch was slightly more underground in a non-pretentious way. Good outside heated patio space and open until 8pm Sunday, probably the right time for me to be getting on my merry way, after an afternoon of drinking games! In summary, it's dependable and neighbourhood-y lacking the attitude of its brethren ilk.",

Entry is via the courtyard - very useful for you smokers and probably great fun once summer decides to show up. Sizewise though, I was a bit surprised that somewhere with a courtyard this big was quite so dinky and intimate inside. The upstair room (probably the larger of the two) has its own bar and the times I've been there, staff have been friendly, quick to serve and usually playing some decent 90s Indie. There's not a lot else to tell about the place, which is why I can only give it a 3. Casual and attitude-free though.",

Tucked away off a large courtyard (which itself looks like a lovely place to hang out in the warmer weather) you enter the bar onto a staircase.On the upper level is the main bar and a mix of modern but slightly rustic-y wooden tables (you know the big chunky type) and chairs and the odd comfy leather sofa. The overall feel is a bit stylish but not overly themed.... plus they have quite a tasty looking food menu with a reasonable selection for an informal after work nibble (didn't partake this time unfortunately). Heading downstairs is a lounge-y bar area \u00a0with a veritable selection of the aforementioned sofas (the small bar there looks like it isn't open unless they're really busy). It feels a bit quiter than the more frenetic upstairs and quite a nice place to hang out for drinks and a chat. The music they played was a pretty good mix from classic and contemporary indie to Bob Dylan. It started getting busier later on and by the time I left around about half 9 the music was getting a bit too loud to talk over, but it's Friday night - so almost dancing time anyway!!A nice bar if you find yourself looking for somewhere cool and comfy, with non-generic music...",

Nothing that I dread more than a bunch of people feeling pissed at the venue and silently cursing me for poor planning - OK, I make my friends sound rather unreasonable here, but consider it a bit of an organizer's nightmare :)It was with some trepidation that I suggested this spot for a casual catch-up over after-work drinks on a Friday night. I did like the mention in the reviews of the place about an adjacent recording studio, a loungey downstairs, a more active upstairs, a large courtyard and most of all, an unpretentious atmosphere. I hoped unpretentious wouldn't translate into grungy; after all, some of the folks I was planning the evening out for are the Mayfair clubbing sorts...We reached the place to find a wee queue outside the entrance but the staff at the door was v polite and fair about the one-in-one-out rule and all of us made our way in within a few mins. It was late autumn, nearly the start of winter, but we chose to hang out in the courtyard under the cosy heaters - there was a large number of people scattered under various heaters but at no point did it seem stuffy. The drinks were generously potent and the music was really good. Most importantly, the crowd at the venue had this casual chic style which was so easy to get used to. We had originally planned to grab a few drinks and then make our way to a nightclub but we ended up having so much fun that we just stayed at the same place; we moved indoors and upstairs eventually, staked out one of the corners and ordered loads more drinks, people-watched in amusement and enjoyed the music. By the time we wrapped up around quarter to 2, all of us concluded that it had been a good night - aka, I recommend this spot!",

We also each ordered the Belgian lambic. We sat upstairs. We got there about 8pm. You're supposed to order food at the bar but it was slammed so our experience was enhanced incredibly by the blonde, lovely Romanian waitress who got our orders at the table. My husband asked for a cut to not be very fatty and the cook obliged, which was a good experience for him. I also got my salad without dressing. For the price it's an excellent value. My husband said his meal wasn't the best taste he ever had but was satisfying. Ditto with my salad- nicely roasted butternut squash chunks but not the best I've ever had. But my my meal was huge! There's are no official takeaway boxes (boo on you Strongroom!) but our lovely waitress somehow scrounged a plastic container for me and kitchen roll. So nice! The entertainment offered seems to be pretty cool; I would definitely come back for that.",

When we got to the bar, the staff were good enough to point out it was \u00a34 for half a pint rather than just serve a pint straight up, but she made no effort to conceal her dirty look for my drink choice (kraken and dandelion and burdock is a lovely summer drink thank you!) before not filling the measure shot very close to the top...We sat outside in the sun, it was busy, with people sat on the floor to ensure they weren't in the shade, but there was a rather large backlog of glasses for the amount of people, which people were regularly knocking over. We only stayed for one drink, leisurely for around 45 minutes, and four+ glasses were smashed in that time, which was only just being swept up as we left. We hoped the people sat on the floor were sober enough to notice if there was glass in their buttcheeks! Nicely stocked bar, and nice enough setting, but really needs better cleaning and tidying!",

    "text": "If I could give negative 5 stars I would. I called to make a reservation 3 days before and called the day of to confirm. We got there and they told us they had no idea we were coming but my name was on the table for a reservation. They attempted to fit a party of 14 on two couches (we told them we were eating dinner) We told them we were ordering dinner and they just ignored us to the point where I had to take the whole groups order and bring it to the bar! I literally was working while I was there out to dinner with my interns. Next, the manager didn't even know the menu and gave two meals to the wrong table. E swore infront us and then brought their food when everyone else was done eating. No apology or offer to take it off the bill. The woman bartender must be the reason why they are still in business because everything else is so chaotic and unorganized. The food was meh and the service was horrendous. We came in for a 7:45 reservation and didn't get food until 9pm. Want a refill on a drink? Well sorry it wasn't offered. I was humiliated that I brought a group of people to this place. No sure how they are still in business or how that man manages the bar when he doesn't have any knowledge of his products or customer service skills. As a company that is here every summer, we are sure to never come back. PS- on top of all that, the manager charged us for things we didn't even order!",

    "text": "Strongrooms is a great place for drinks with a nice outdoor area with it's own bar. There is food, pizzas, wraps, sandwiches, the usual fare. Nothing special, but decent enough for lunch.The atmosphere is nice and relaxed without being overtly trendy or pretentious. In Shoreditch that is something you need.I think there is limited parking at the site itself, perhaps utilised by the recording studio nearby, which commonly leads to people nearly getting run over, as drinking whilst a car is pulling through is not a helpful thing. But I guess helps keep you alert.",
