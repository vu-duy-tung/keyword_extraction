They offer a good selection of drinks, some decent food that's above average compared to typical pub fare, and a nice atmosphere in which to enjoy a quiet drink. There's an upstairs area too that features a cosy library with a wonderful fireplace, just what the doctor ordered for a cold winter night.Drawbacks? Well it's fairly pricey but standard for London, and err, the men's toilets are tricky to get to down some steep steps especially after you've had a few drinks!",

By the time I was done with my beer, I was offered a pint of ESB from an old Chap named Nick who had raced in the Daytona races back in the 70's. He was really cheeky and interesting so I joined him and some new friends on the patio outside and later inside upstairs in the library. I had a big Indian dinner and didn't eat here but was amazed at the meat pie's being delivered to near by tables. Later in the night, I really wanted to have some chips and curry aka french fries but the kitchen had closed. Instead my new friends from Sweden and I had crisps aka potato chips and discussed politics, racism in America and other interesting topics. All that was missing was a pipe to smoke like Sherlock Holmes. Ha!Perfect first night in London.",

The was a party of 5 sitting next to us and another couple across the room and a single person sitting on the couch. Everyone enjoying their food and company. A couple of minutes go by and no service. Ok no big deal. I went downstairs to see if we order from the bar and was told that someone will be with me shortly. She asked if I'm upstairs and I said yes. Minutes past, nothing. Went to go check again. Same thing happen. I noticed a\"light switch\" next to my table and saw a bell icon on it. So I thought that we might have to ring the bell. I pressed it, some one finally looked their head in the room and for a split second then disappeared after glancing at the large table. Pressed it again. Same thing. The server took a quick glance at the large table and disappeared. Not even looking at us or anyone else for that matter. I don't know but after that we left. It was when we were heading out some one acknowledged us that we were there.... I had enjoyed my time in London until that time",

We weren't acknowledged or greeted so we walked over to the dining area and waited for a small table to be cleared. We tried to wave the server down several times, but she ignored us and avoided eye contact--turns out (I guess) we were supposed to order drinks and food at the bar...at least that is what we ended up doing. That aside: we both ordered fish and chips and what we thought would be \"starters\" or appetizers. It all came at once. I had been looking forward to the light flakey crust another Yelp user had written about. Instead, our fillets were dark brown with a hardened crust and inside the fish had been well shrunken (due to over cooking) and was very chewy. Regarding appetizers: I enjoyed the scotch egg (my first), but the bowl of mini sausages were nearly tasteless if not for the sauce. On the plus side, it was everything we had hoped to find in terms of the style and atmosphere you hope to find in a British Pub. On a calmer night this may have been a different story, and the harried waitstaff may have been more attentive; however, the poor food quality isn't as easy to forgive. If this review was based on food alone, I would have given it one star.",

    "text": "The Victoria was an unexpected delight. Going in, I knew I was going to a Pub with good food and that I could rely on (thanks, Yelp!), and I hoped I would be able to hear and have a good conversation with our group of 4 without yelling (because you just never know). We made a reservation, which they are nice enough to take via their website, and were seated upstairs in the \"Library Room\". The Library Room is everything I love about London: a random, lovely experience in an unexpected place with good food. With a wood burning fire place and bookcase walls, the library room has only 4 tables (giving it an intimate feeling), but the high ceilings make it still feel spacious. Set apart from the main part of the Pub, it was quiet enough for nice conversation and felt like the kind of place you could loiter and socialize over pints or a bottle(s) of wine for ages. (If you want to be the best date-planner ever, book the comfy seat in front of the fire place in the Library Room. The drinks are affordable at the Victoria, and your date will never suspect it because the ambience is so good)The food was above average (top notch for a Pub), though it's definitely not the part I found most memorable. However, (fun fact), when you put black currant in Guinness it makes for a magical, less bitter, thing. You should try it, it's strange and amazing.I really enjoyed the Victoria, and would definitely recommend it (especially for the kind of casual, but intimate dinner we had).",

The only downside I can think of is that the gents' toilet is down in the basement, which can only be accessed by means of the steepest, narrowest staircase I have ever seen. It has to be negotiated sideways - particularly after two or three of the Fullers beers on offer in the bar. But it would be churlish to deduct a star from this wonderful oasis simply for that reason. Outstanding place that everyone should visit.",

    "text": "A very pleasant pub near Paddington! Thanks to the yelpers on the resounding \"yes\" for this place, it panned out exactly as planned...much appreciated. A cousin of ours had a 6 hour layover at Heathrow, so we all decided to take the opportunity to meet for a late Sunday lunch. Needing something very near Paddington Station for ease, The Victoria seemed undoubtedly the best choice. Right-o, it was indeed. We perched at a comfortable table for a few hours, enjoying a leisurely Sunday with locals and travelers alike. The bar was dotted with folks, as were most of the tables...overflow surely could've taken over the upstairs, which was quite delightful as well (especially for a private party!). The fish 'n chips (my choice) were satisfying and the boys both indulged in pork belly roasts, plates both cleaned if that is any indication. Very nicely done! As is mentioned in many a review...the beer selection is minimal, but passable. Pints for all, and to all a good night. Service was as expected. Not particularly warm, but efficient none the less. Would surely come back if I needed a solid pub in Paddington again...perhaps next time to the upstairs library.",

We were told that the food would be a 30 minute wait, but we ended up waiting a good 1 hour and 30 minutes. The waitresses/workers never apologized for the long wait and we were never served the waters we ordered, just the beer. When the food came, I was disappointed to see that there were no actual crisps (the waitress told me after I complained that they were \"cheese crisps\", which I did not see). She also told me that I misunderstood what the menu said but it clearly said \"crisps\" and not \"cheese crisps\". Also the chicken was dry/slightly burnt and the salad was drenched with sweet vinaigrette, not garlic mayo at all. I'm giving 2 stars because I appreciate the history behind the place and my friend liked his beer, but based on the service and my chicken dish, I would not come back again.",

    "text": "My family and I went to Victoria on our first Sunday night in London. I had researched it in advance as an authentic pub for Sunday roast, the traditional Sunday pub dinner. As with most pubs you order food and drinks at the bar and they bring them to the table. It has a very authentic feel with mostly locals. The bartender was very attentive and didn't make us feel uncomfortable as Yanks. We started by sitting outside and had our appetizers before the sky opened and it poured. We had to move inside to the upstairs room. \u00a0We sampled three beers (London Pride, Oliver's Island and ESB) and had the smoked trout (7 pounds) and chicken satay (5 pounds) apps. The smoked trout had raisins and a fruit puree which I thought was too sweet. Something with a little acid would have been better. The family all had fish and chips (13 pounds) while I had the Sunday roast (16.50 pounds). Unfortunately my roast beef was very tough, a real disappointment. My family all liked their fish and chips though. Total with drinks was 93.75 pounds. About $150 at current exchange.",

    "text": "My wife and I had heard about London's legendary Sunday roasts so we were excited to experience it for ourselves. Seeing this establishment recommended in PaddingtonNow magazine, as well as its many rave reviews on Yelp and Google, we decided to give The Victoria a chance to shine.Everything leading up to the meal itself went swimmingly: we visited them on Saturday to reserve a table and the server offered to have the kitchen set aside the roast beef and lamb for us. Sunday evening came and sadly the experience devolved into a massive disappointment the moment we took our seats. My wife's roast beef was overcooked to a leather-like texture. The potatoes, supposedly roasted in duck fat, featured thick, dry crusts that we could barely cut into with our dinner knives. My lamb was tender but the Yorkshire pudding was burnt to a blackened top. The fact that it even made it onto my plate showed either a blatant lack of attention, an indfference for quality, for both. Hilariously, when I pointed this out to a server, he nonchalantly offered \"Well, would you like me to get you another one?\" (Oh no, I'm obviously content eating this miniature bowler hat, thank you very much.) He also observed that we had not received our standard gravy on the side, which truth be told was sorely needed to rehydrate the tough sod on our plates.Despite our advance reservation and notice, my guess is that the kitchen just set aside some lunchtime roast leftovers, tossed them in the oven when we arrived, then set and forgot them on broil for too long. The food was lazy, insincere, and boring, which would be acceptable at McDonald's but not here at \u00a317 a head. And if it's any indication, we watched the table next to us order steak and sausages - they ended up sending their food back three times before giving up and leaving.But what about the service? In a nutshell, aloof and less than adequate. Our server walked by our table no less than four times without checking if we needed anything when we were clearly waiting for the bill. She almost overcharged us by mucking up the math. And just as we were ready to take our leave we witnessed another server spilling red wine all over an adjacent table of five. The comedy of errors was finally complete.Honestly, I understand. This is a historic location with a colorful list of noteworthy patrons. The decor is charming, the atmosphere cozy, and it's probably a perfectly decent watering hole. But word to the wise: stick to their drinks. As it stands, this pub's namesake Queen Victoria would be thoroughly embarrassed by the kitchen and staff.",

    "text": "A good night outThis is really a classic pub like you would imagine. Location is on a more quiet corner, but near Hyde Park / Victoria Gate.We chose this place based on good feedback online and the fact that it's dog friendly (even inside). We came here on a saturday and naturally the place was full, inside and outside. But about only 20mins or so we were able to catch a table inside.It is a lovely pub. Lots of wood, a bit dark....nice interiour. Exactly the way we like it. The menu was interesting, having some of the old classics, but also some innovative choices. We ordered Scotch Eggs (Black pudding version), Calamari Rings and a Chorizo Burger....and some pints.Service was fine, quite busy of course. The Calamari Rings were good, crispy. Scotch Eggs were really good, nice twist with the Black Pudding outside. A bit too well done inside - but that's a hard thing to get completely right. The Burger was - let's say - interesting. Making it out of or with Chorizo sausages is a great idea. The flavour was really good I gotta say. But sadly it was a pretty dry burger. Some fat, some meat juice was missing. But at 10\u00a3 including a pint a steal!All in all a good dinner in a really wonderful pub. Not the very best ever, but a good choice.",

    "text": "I made reservations weeks in advance to securely obtain a spot at this place, with no knowledge of the popularity of the place. We had a reservation for 19:15, which I already accounted for delays as we plan to eat at this place after landing at London Heathrow. However, customs took longer than usual and we ended up 40 minutes late. However, they were nice about it and still saved a spot for us, even though in the email it says that they will nullify the reservation if you are 15 minutes late unless you call. I called but no one picked up, so I emailed them, but regardless, I guess they got the memo.Note to Americans or others who are not used to the structure of a traditional English restaurant: I learned it on the spot but it was a bit difficult. There is a lower level seating that is crowded with lots of people waiting outside to get in. I sort of waited a few minutes and tried to locate a person to let them know I have a reservation, but I see no one except the bartender. That lower level seating is a bar and for those with no reservations. The upper level seating is the \"restaurant,\" and a server asked us if we had reservations and I said yes, so she showed me to our table. I noticed that there is a chalkboard that said that the restaurant is fully booked, which means we unexpectedly stumbled upon a popular establishment in London!The ambience is amazing, but I guess it's because it's different from the typical minimalistic ambience in the US. This has a more classic, old-school ambience which gives a more welcoming home-like feeling. There were even books that had actual texts just behind where we sat! This is the first introduction to official British food and I really had a great first impression. We got the octopus appetizer and it was so soft and chewy. It is definitely very fresh and complements well with the oil and potatoes. I sampled my brother's fish and chips and I got the sausage with mashed potatoes. Both dishes were great and not overly salted. Service was a bit slow, but I guess because most European countries do not mandate tips, I sort of expected it. However, they had a button/switch where you can press to request service, which was a plus, despite the fact that I had to press 2 times to have a server come to us.",

In the mood for authentic English food I browsed yelp, then checked the menu, the price location and everything about this just seemed right.The restaurant, although reasonably priced had a nice formal and beings with stiff white cotton napkins starched stiffer than the British upper lip greeted us. The waitress was extremely friendly and helpful, although the service was slow and the restaurant could do with a little extra help but she was pleasant and courteous running around to serve all her customers. I ordered the meat pies which looked small but was incredibly filling and decadently delicious. Everything was simply perfect. Just a word of caution to fellow yelpers, the restaurant does get busy and they do not have adequate staff so please be a little patient. It is worth it. A tip, they have two mills on the table which in North America be mainly used for getting freshly crushed pepper. However, in this case, one contained salt crystals while the other contained pepper. I mistook the first salt Mill to be the Pepper Mill and accidentally over seasoned my food. If the owner or manager is reading this review, kindly label your salt and pepper mills appropriately. All in all a great experience and on my list if I visit London again",

I ordered the Banger and Mash which was just delicious! The sausage had a great flavor and the mashed potatoes were light and fluffy. My brother had the fish and chips which was delicious as well. The fish tasted fresh and the flavor was just spot on. Both plates had great sized portions as well. For beer choice I had the Frontier and my brother had the Guinness.

We were battling some jet lag and wanted to find a pub near the train station for a quick bite and drink to refuel. The exterior is cute and the interior is everything you would imagine an authentic pub to be. Beautiful details all throughout the building with a great view from their second floor. We ordered a few small plates and they were fresh and delicious. Highly recommend if you are in the area!",

    "text": "Travelling in London for a few days and decided to stop by for lunch.Ordered everything that looked good on Yelp review pictures, and everything was good indeed.Starters: Honey mustard mini pork sausage, calamari. Both were neatly made and presented. Calamari was thin, but in a very good way, that you're not eating a large ring of squid which can often be greasy.Main: Wild mushroom and egg on brioche, steak (not on regular menu). I ordered the steak medium but it came out more of a medium well, but it was the only part of the meal that I did not enjoy. All the complementaries for the steak: sauce, tomato, mushroom, and chips were good. Only had one bite of the mushroom on toast, it was also pretty good.Dessert: Sticky toffee pudding w/ caramel ice cream. This was amazing and to die for. Very spongy pudding; every spoon was just satisfying.Overall: 4.5/5I wanted to round it down b/c of the steak but giving a 4/5 would actually bring down the ratings of this place, and that would be a shame. Definitely recommend giving this place a visit; one of the best meals that I've had in England.",

Once I made it through passport control, catching a train to Paddington and accomplishing the former was easy.I took a nice 10m stroll down to the Victoria, a cozy 19th century pub and neighbourhood institution. Walking in about a half hour after opening, the place had just a few others sitting down for lunchtime brews.That plate of fish and chips came with a massive plank of beer battered cod, a pile of thick chips, a small dish of mushy peas, and a bit of tartar sauce. The fish was straight from the fryer hot, with the moist, flaky cod surrounded by perfectly crispy (and just greasy enough) batter. The chips were good, though nothing out of the ordinary, but definitely improved by a few splashes of malt vinegar. Washed down with a London Pride, this was a proper way to start a trip in the UK",

The flavors just don't mix. Te fish flavor of the dressing with the game flavor of the rabbit and the mild tones of venison just clashed. On top if this, the rabbit was not adequately deboned. Lastly, the fish and chips were some of the more bland fish and chips that we have had in London. Definitely not the item to order here.

The main ground floor bar (originally divided into Public and Saloon Bars, but now one bar) is an amazing example of a High Victorian interior, with acres of polished wood, two impressive fireplaces and mirrors decorated with an intricate fleur-de-lys pattern. A clock on the wall is dated 1864, although the area was built in the period 1830-40. Upstairs are two rooms (both available for hire): the Library is like a room in a private house, with wood panelling, a large decorative fireplace and classical Georgian detailing - broken pediments, scallop-shell recesses, and is cosy and intimate. The Theatre Bar is an extraordinary room, with a painted ceiling, heavy drapes over the curtains and white wood and gilt detailing. Much of it apparently came from the old Gaiety Theatre on the Strand. It is owned by Fuller's, and serves their real ales as well as highly regarded food (though I've not eaten here). I tried a pint of Fuller's IPA - not always easy to get - which was malty for an IPA, and at 4.8% pretty strong, too. The men's toilets are down a steep and windy staircase, with narrow steps, so be careful how many pints you have before descending",

    "text": "This is my London SPOT. I've stayed twice at a b&b just down the street and I love going to the Victoria. It was the first pub in London I'd been to and continues to be one of my favorites. My friends and I sometimes talk about how we wish we could take the Victoria and plop it down in Manhattan. The decor is everything you hope a London pub to be- cozy, historical, and lots of little corners you can just disappear to. The food is good and I'm a big fan of Fuller's so the beer selection is great.They seem to get a good amount of both tourists (due to the fact that it's close to Paddington Station and there are tons of b&bs in the area) and locals. I've had conservations with people who live in the neighborhood and fellow visitors like myself from all over the world. People are definitely chatty here, which is cool. The bartenders are always really friendly too. I've noticed it definitely does get busy even on random days of the week like Mondays or Tuesdays but if you can get in and get a seat, it's well worth it.",

The bartender was very friendly and recommended the elderflower water which I have never heard of, but tasted like a lychee flavored soda-refreshing. Another woman took our order and was very patient with explaining some of the dishes as we weren't familiar with British food.We ended up ordering the Irish Stew and Sausages w/mash. I did not like the Irish Stew-it was basically boiled bland cubes of meat with tendons all over it and potatoes. Personally, not my taste. However, the sausages were juicy and very flavorful. As a dessert we tried the Sticky Toffee Pudding which was my absolute favorite...warm and moist cake topped with a gooey toffee sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yumm! \u00a0Throughout our meal, the bartenders and waitresses checked up on us to see if we needed anything. A bit loud but a great hangout place for groups and they have a large selection of beers on tap. Nice cozy fireplaces on the first floor and there's an upstairs 'library room' for private groups.",

    "text": "(2009) First trip to London...we asked the hotel concierge where they suggest going for a pint and some good food. He of course suggested things close to the hotel, or in the hotel...places the hotel suggests. We interrupted him, apologized and said, \"What we meant is...when you get off of work tonight, where would YOU go for a good beer and a good meal?\" He directed us here. It was maybe a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel, and it was worth every minute. One of the things I love about London, is when we walked into the place, one of the servers said \"just find a spot anywhere and we'll find you\" - and they meant it. They keep track of the sections they work in with such detail - they know who comes and goes and they're on top of things. We found a spot at the bar and loved the ambiance, loved the beer, LOVED the food (I had fish & chips, of course. Boyfriend had steak & guinness pie)...they had a pub quiz going on that night - and even though we knew no one, many people asked us if we wanted to be on their team, since it was just the two of us. It was great in there...when we return to London, we'll definitely return to The Victoria!",

Great interior, while nobody can say how old really, certainly looks like most of it has been around for a very, very long time.The artwork of the mirrors behind the bar feels original, as do many other details. It is said, but no one can prove it, that people like Charles Dickens and Winston Churchill used to be regulars in their times. Beers are mostly variety of Fullers, but also of the inernational variety. I was drawn to a pint of Leffe which was great. I found the people at the bar extremely friendly while I was probably the only visitor not living around the corner. What hurts the wandering eye a bit are the aircondition boxes mounted to the ceiling, but then it is not a museum but a place where people go to enjoy a pint or two.",

If you're already familiar with pub culture, and just looking for a drink, conversation and some great food, the Victoria is equally welcoming. The Victoria is small but cozy, with a terrific kitchen. Sunday night, as at many pubs, is roast night, and the meals are incredibly savory. I had the single best best turkey dinner of my life at the Victoria, with a small cube of stuffing that was so flavorful that my initial disappointment at only getting a small cube vanished immediately. The roast potatoes and green beans were equally delicious. The staff is friendly, as are the patrons; I've never failed to engage or be engaged in conversation when sitting at the bar. I'm told there's a second room upstairs, but I love the bar so much, I've never even taken a look!This is one of a handful of places that makes me long to visit \u00a0London.",

    "text": "Based on Yelp reviews and a desire to have some good pub grub, we stopped by The Victorian twice over two days. \u00a0The first time, it was so crowded that there was no room for our party of 5, but I had gone upstairs and spotted a 5 top table seating two women who were about ready to leave. \u00a0When I asked the one of the wait staff about possibly waiting for that table, when he went up, he said there were no tables. \u00a0It turns out that in the minutes between my spotting the tables and the waiter ascending the narrow spiral staircase upstairs, someone had run up and was squatting on the table. \u00a0So we left and had Indian food at another restaurant closer to Paddington Station that night. \u00a0The second night, which was midweek and earlier in the evening, the situation was different. \u00a0While there was still no seating downstairs, there was a 5 top in the library, which appeared to be occupied by two women with 2 small girls who were playing on the couch. \u00a0They appeared to be done eating, so I had our group head up the narrow spiral staircase to take their places at the other 2 toppers until the women and girls left. \u00a0Once they headed down the stairs, we moved in on the dirty table covered with glasses of partially consumed juices and then wondered what to do next. \u00a0It took a while to spot buttons next to the table tops labeled \"Press for Service\", so we did. \u00a0These are momentary toggle switches so we weren't sure if they were working, but after a second press, and carefully listening for footsteps up the narrow spiral staircase, one of the waitresses came up. \u00a0We helped her clear the tables while she explained that we had to go downstairs to the bar and place our orders there. \u00a0The food would then be delivered when it was done. \u00a0She was obviously overly busy but did a good job once we got her up the stairs. As Americans, this seemed odd, but perhaps this is the British way, so when in Britain...We assembled our order and I headed downstairs with two of our party with the other 3 holding down the table. \u00a0I placed the order at the bar and we had to carry our own drinks, water pitcher and glasses up that narrow spiral staircase. However, by then, we had the library all to ourselves, and it was a very intimate setting for a quiet family dinner, where we could chat about what we each had found most interesting during our day at the British Museum. \u00a0When the food arrived, which took about 10-15 minutes, it was hot, well prepared, well presented and delicious. \u00a0We had ordered a meat pie, couple of burgers, lamb shank and chicken entree. \u00a0All were served with fresh veggies on the side or hand cut chips (fries). \u00a0They also had a good selection of beers and ales to choose from both on tap and in bottles. \u00a0In summary if you are a party of 2, and don't mind sitting at the bar downstairs, this place is the cat's meow for a British Pub experience, but for a larger group, this will take some strategy and planning to get a table, and don't expect much service if you end up going upstairs. While these upstairs rooms have a ton of charm and character, the staff have to negotiate an incredibly narrow and tight spiral staircase, which is one way traffic, and if you encounter someone halfway, someone's gonna have to back track either to the top or bottom landing. I would give the atmosphere, drinks and food 4 stars, but service 3 stars- which is as high as you will ever get in a true British pub.",

    "text": "Outstanding fish and chips, cool pub environment. Full disclosure: I am not a fish and chips expert but I know good food when I get it. This place has a good pub atmosphere and a small but quality beer selection. The fish was large in size, so much so that we split an order. Not greasy and very crispy with light batter. Chips were also crisp and not greasy. \u00a0Would gladly dine here again had lunch here with my wife and 2 kids(ages13,10) but could see if we dined here later at night, might not be all that good for kids but lunch and early dinner \u00a0no worries",

Maybe because it was Christmas time and a lovely evening - but the pub was so magical. It was so quaint and warm. Just the perfect spot. They staff was pretty friendly - nothing over the top, but just enough.We had some great beers on tap and of course some sticky toffee pudding. Wow. It was good. I'm obsessed with it and have to have it everywhere I go, and this was a good one.I've been to a lot pubs in my life, and this one, was wonderful.",

It has delicious food and a wonderful atmosphere. The staff was extremely friendly and the menu also had a lot of vegetarian options which was nice for the vegetarian in our party. Try the sticky toffee pudding. It's incredible.",

We sat outside, but there are lots of sweet rooms inside, especially upstairs. \u00a0The service is friendly, if not necessarily prompt, and the food is delicious. \u00a0We tried everything from salad to sausage to pie to a sandwich. \u00a0I will definitely be heading back very soon!",

The food -fish and chips and baked ricotta appetizer was ok (too greasy for my or my husbands liking)- but the sticky toffee pudding was moist and super yummy...the vanilla bean ice cream with it balanced out the richness and sweetness of the toffee. This place was packed at 6 with many locals and tourists. Cool place to hang if you're in the area.",
