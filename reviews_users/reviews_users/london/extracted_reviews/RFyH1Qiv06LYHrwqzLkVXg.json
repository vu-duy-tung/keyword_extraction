I was told that there is 30 min wait. I said ok. But the guy at the front desk was least interested in taking down my name so that he can put me on the queue. Then I asked him about downstairs area. That's when he told me that there is no wait downstirs. So I went downstairs. There my family and I were seated immediately. But no one showed up to take the order. Or wasn't even offered water until I asked 4 times. I was getting flustered so I asked the manager to see if he can help provide better experience. But still no one offered to fill up water or came to check if I need seconds. Lastly no one showed up to collect the credit card for bill payment.But they were quick to charge 12% tip/service charge.How does this place get so much raving reviews. \u00a0Or Does the quality of service depends on skin color?",

Seated next to me, were a bunch of Indian tweens who had designer handbags worth thousands, and other families with a lot of money. So you know this place had to have good Indian food. We got a variety of dishes, the starters I was not too impressed about. I would not get the chaats or the lollipop chicken, the chaats were too organized, and the lollipop chicken was just meh. Chaat salad is messy and crushed up, the way it's meant to be eaten, whereas here it's organized into a neat little bite. Fortunately, the main dishes were much better. The Pulusi chicken was really flavorful and packed a good punch, it tasted great over rice. The ground duck dish was really different, but also tasty. I've never had duck in an Indian dish before, but I had to get something I have never seen at home, and glad I did. The ground duck didn't really taste like duck, but nevertheless the spices and and the meat were delicious over rice. I wish Roti Chai was in DC, I would definitely go there again if I was in London.",

The first time I was with a friend visiting from the US, and the waitstaff gamely allowed her to order, for herself, an entire 500 ml carafe of wine--hey, we don't use metric in America, so sue us! I had a very tasty, but not too strong, ginger mojito. We split an order of samosas that were exemplary of the form--definitely get them! She had Hakka chicken Manchurian and I had the lamb curry with potatoes and roti. I enjoyed her Manchurian more than I enjoyed the lamb, but I think maybe I'm just not a huge fan of lamb. It was definitely tasty, but the roti to gravy proportions were off and I would have appreciated more bread to sop everything up.The second time, I ate downstairs with visiting family. You MUST get the shrimp curry if they have it. It is incredible. We also split the chicken 65, the seekh kebab, a fish curry, and the butter chicken, which were all very good. That was more than enough for a family of four, and I would recommend a family-style setup if you have enough people, so you can try everything. My mother and I also split a pretty epic bread pudding, and my brother loved his malai kulfi.Roti Chai is very close to the Marble Arch tube station, but it can be hard to find for new visitors or foreign tourists. It's on a sidestreet that's pretty out of the way across from the Thistle hotel. Just keep looking and you will find it!",

There are, as the other reviewers note, two restaurants: a formal dining room downstairs and a more bustling street food place upstairs. We reserved downstairs, but when we saw the upstairs we opted to eat there instead. Food was delicious. Everything was fresh and hot. We had samosas to start. I've had some bad samosas in my life (rancid oil, greasy, heavy)--these were terrific: hot, tasty, fresh and, for samosas, light. We had a special chicken and lamb curry for our mains. Both fabulous. They came with rice and bread, which was nice, since some Indian restaurants tend to upsell the sides. Service was good and the crowd enthusiastic.A very nice, informal experience. I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "There are two levels -- the Street Kitchen and Dining Room (downstairs) -- and each has a completely different menu so be sure to peruse them before deciding where you want to dine (by the way, they offer more than what the menus online indicate). \u00a0We decided on the more casual Street Kitchen.There is a featured cocktail of the month, which was a Lychee Teapot Martini when we went in July. \u00a0We didn't order it, opting instead for:* MAHA MOJITO - Made with ginger, mint and a rum blend, it was fine, but nothing of note. * KOVALAM BEACH - This one was a non-alcoholic cocktail made with ginger ale, lychee, guava and coconut. \u00a0It was pretty good, but the best one was... * COCONUT AND GUAVA BELLINI SHARBAT - Amazing! \u00a0Subtle, sweet and very refreshing. \u00a0We definitely had another. \u00a0It was easily the best drink we had during our entire trip to London!There is also a seasonal special featured on the menu. \u00a0When we went they were showcasing the MANCHURIAN, a classic dish which they describe \"was created by Nelson Wang in Mumbai in 1975 and involves a traditional Indian sauce made with ginger, garlic and chilis but finished with dark soy sauce rather than garam masala to create a unique flavour.\" \u00a0We ordered the CHICKEN MANCHURIAN. \u00a0It came with a bowl of steamed rice. \u00a0Very akin to adobo dishes I've had. \u00a0Good, but not the best thing we had. \u00a0The portions are on the small side on the street level, but are still shareable. \u00a0We also ordered:* RAILWAY LAMB CURRY - Lamb and potatoes served with two chapatis. \u00a0Our server offered to substitute rice for the chapatis. \u00a0I declined but eventually ordered a side of rice anyhow to soak up some curry. \u00a0Yummy. \u00a0I preferred this one to the Manchurian.* SAMOSAS - We chose the spicy pea and potato samosas. \u00a0You get two of them, plus chickpeas and dipping sauces. \u00a0A tad on the dry side but generally still a good choice.yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026* TARKA DHAL - Yellow lentils. \u00a0Delicious. \u00a0Must have rice or something to eat this with.* CHICKEN LOLLIPOPS - This was our favorite dish! \u00a0You get five of these Moreish Keralan spiced chicken wings and a dipping sauce. \u00a0So good! \u00a0We almost (almost) ordered another, but as it was we had already over-ordered and this place is not cheap.yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026* Side of ROTI - Good by itself and topped with dhal, curry, etc.yelp.com/user_local_phot\u2026",

The food itself is quite good - we had the chicken and lamb curries as mains which were quite tasty. For starters we had pani puri and papdi chat - these were a bit disappointing. Didn't have the zing that chaat is supposed to have. All in all - decent Indian food that isn't too greasy and isn't too expensive.",

I have not had to make a reservation when going for lunch but am unsure about dinner. There is ample room upstairs and a huge downstairs area which they probably open up for overflow.This is a child friendly spot with high chairs and pram parking. Now for the food... It's AMAZING! Everything I've ordered has been delicious. My husband and I went here when I was pregnant and ordered the hot wings to try and induce labour. While it didn't work, the hotness level was intense! We both have high tolerance for spice so this was prefect for us!",

The main floor is indian street food (recommended), while the basement is a bit more formal (although I have never eaten there). My suggestion is to try out a few items family style from the vibrant and diverse menu. Everything is worth trying (bun kebab, chicken lollipops, papri chaat, railway lamb and chicken pulusu) are all unique and tasty. If you like to try a fancy drink, I suggest trying their special martini. I forget the name but its pinkish, served cold in a kettle and very obvious when you look at the menu.",

Our server Veronika was not only attentive, but she was also a great guide towards what to order and was incredibly kind. For dinner we had the Hakka Chili Paneer (very spicy and flavorful,) vegetable samosas (more so mild but good,) chicken samosa chaat (WOW! So decadent and yummy,) the pulusu chicken (decadent,) and last but certainly not least the duck porridge. The duck porridge was by far the favorite item and despite being full I nearly devoured the whole bowl. The duck meat is minced and is absolutely fantastic. I am not usually a duck eater, but this porridge has won me over! Definitely give it a try. For dessert we finished off our wondrous meal with a mango kulfi and a pistachio kulfi, which was the perfect end to a fantastic meal.",

The pani had the correct amount of tang, sweetness and hotness to it.The masala chai, however was a disappointment. it felt more like someone had boiled some hot water in a hurry with a tea bag and a drop of milk in it. I mean, an establishment called roti chai serves a deplorable chai and that's a bit ironic.Nevertheless, 3 stars for a good pani puri, quick seating and decent customer service.",

We ate in the dining room and ordered a couple of dishes such as palak paneer, naan, tarka dal, chilli paneer and an eggplant main whose name I cannot remember. The food was quite good ...not your typical Indian fare with layers of oil. Now the bad part - The service was shoddy ...we waited and waited for our starters and mains. The server was polite but seems like it is not managed very well. A big '0' for the value for money part :( :( The portions were shockingly small ! Now I am not a big eater ...but if I don't feel at least half full ..it is a sign that the quantity sucked. Not sure if the portions are this tiny because they are bending over backwards to remain on Oxford St ! Please avoid this place if you want a bang for your buck. An average meal for two will burn a hole in your pocket and leave you hungry for more (literally!). Such a disappointing meal :( and such a high cost 50 GBP for it !",

The spices are so tasty but not overwhelming, that you can still taste the freshness of the meat and vegetable. I am now waiting for my desert and I am sure that they will be as good. Thumbs up.

    "text": "This place really has some incredible food. And the small plates versus main allows you to trial and share some really fabulous dishes. The most popular one we saw was the warm paneer salad on every table. It was really quite spicy and warm lettuce could throw you off, but definitely worth consuming. I could have eaten one whole one by myself, but then I wouldn't have been able to taste anything else due to the spice level. Our table also ordered the railroad lamb curry stew, which was quite good and the \"burrito\" like wrap for it did not quite hold in all the stew. Would possibly recommend ordering a side of rice to eat with this. And the chicken burger, but I don't remember its name off the top of my head. This was more than enough food for 2 people for lunch, though everything was so good it wouldn't hurt to order more just to try everything on the menu. Or bring a big group here so you can split everything.",

My husband and I shared the Schezwan chilli paneer. Seriously, hold me down. Bada**. I then had the palak paneer and tarka daal, accompanied by the roti and naan plate. Wow, the paneer melted in my mouth, the palak was of the gods, and the daal was unique, and tasted like the most epic buttery daal goodness I've ever had. Broke my taste buds. Rico. Rico. Rico.The service was excellent. The waiter and manager were both very present, without being overbearing. Def going back!Update:2 days later we went back to try the Indian street food (upstairs). Def underwhelming. They were slammed, and maybe that affected preparation/service. I wouldn't go back for the street food, but would for sure go back to the dining room food.",

This place is full with both Indian business men and Indian families, so expect a noisy crowd but also great food.I feel lucky to love Indian food and even more lucky to have found this place. I have not yet tried the second floor dining restaurant but I do love the ground floor street food restaurant. It's a light, clean and open, modern interior with some Indian street signs. The chai is tasty and has real spices, the chilli paneer is nicely spicy (really great but actually quite spicy) and comes with a lot of vegetables (a bit more paneer would have been great), the pani puri is a fun chaat dish and often not advisable to have in India because of the water used but here it's just great.The Andra Pradesh chicken curry is a great spicy juicy curry and made me almost overeat myself, just like I use to do in India ;-)The food is very affordable as well, great value!",

    "text": "My first night in London, we decided to stay near the action which luckily happens to be a quick ride from the flat where I'm staying. My bro suggested we have some Indian so we went into Roti Chai.The upstairs of RC has an unassuming dining hall style space with a tapas inspired indian menu. Traditional diners can head downstairs for full waiter and menu service. We did and ordered:Bengali fish and crab cakes - 9/10 I couldn't differentiate between the two but both were of great consistency, dressed with wonderful colourful sauce and crunchy coated warmness. Near best fish/crab cakes ever had (two establishments in Chicago and Tanzania still hold those titles).Schezwan chilli paneer- 8/10 This was the other appetizer star of the night. A familiar dish but served on skewers for a change, this proved to be an excellent vegetarian option, and perfect for a mild palate.Saagwala gosht- 9/10Now as far as the mains were concerned, this is one for the books. I never order gosht but will have to remember it moving forward. Succulent goat meat in a green bath of herbs and yoghurt- almost the perfect 10 in my humble opinion. Could have been spicier though.Butter chicken- 7.5/10This was my main dish and met (but did not exceed) my expectations. Cooked beautifully, it paled in comparison to the other mains shared but no leftovers so don't be shy to order it up.Awadhi lamb rack- 8.5/10This was the best dish as far as presentation goes, and the lamb itself was tender and very flavourful, but its portion was a bit on the small side and it did not accompany the rice and naan as well as the curry and stew.Garlic naan- 6/10- garlicky but could use some salt &butter. Bit flat. Rice- 8/10- your standard saffron rice, more dry than sticky. Wine- 10/10This fabulous meal was enjoyed with a bottle of Pinot Grigio that I've also noted for future reference. Lastly for dessert we tried the chocolate mousse- 8/10. It was enjoyable. Small yet rich enough to be shared, it came with a cream sauce and was a great way to end the night, savour-wise. Wished I'd had a coffee with it for an ideal palate cleanser duo.Overall: 4.5 but rounded up for atmosphere + service points. See pics.I RECOMMEND- Exploring the menu! Nothing displeased us. EXTRA TIP-Slightly on the pricey side. We were in a celebratory (read: indulgent) mood but our bill was on the high end especially for the travelling diner (damn you ole GBP!) Stay upstairs in the street kitchen if you respect your budget ;)",

    "text": "A Indian New Yorker has Indian food in London. The YELP community very rarely leads me astray, and although they were a little bit below the mark, Roti Chai was still a decent food option. To note, I am sure there are plenty other fantastic Indian spots in this city, that this wouldn't be my first pick going forward. But if you are in the neighborhood and want quick food and service this would probably be your best bet. Let's break it down shall we?3 friends go to Roti Chai and share some Indian dishes Tapas style, and here's what we thought!STREET SECTION:1. Aloo Papri Chaat (4.8GBP) - The papri (circular fried bread base was crispy, but not fresh), the aloo (potato) was well made, and the toppings were tasty, but not fresh again. It was decent, and edible, but not exciting or by any means the best papri chaat I've had. Decently priced for the portion. Rating = 3/52. Chicken Lollipops (5.5GBP) - Good texture, taste, although could have used more flavor, spice, and seasoning. But still delicious, and one of the better dishes we had, good price for the portion. Rating = 4/53. Agni 'Fire' Wings (5.9GBP) - Well made, although I thought the chicken could have been cook a tad more. The accompanying sauces were good, and the wings were indeed spicy. I will have to say, they were not \"Indian spicy\" but still created some heat and were well \"sauced.\" Again, good portion for the price. Rating = 4/54. Hakka Chilli Paneer (5.5GBP) - My favorite dish, as the quality of each paneer was perfection. Perfectly seasoned and flavored. The paneer was also cooked to perfection and tasted more fresh than 1, 2 and 3 (above). My one qualm with this dish was there was very little paneer, and vegetables took up most of the dish which isn't what you are paying for. Quality = 4/5, Quantity = 3/5, Rating = 3.5/5.ROAD & RAIL:1. Gobi Manchurian (7.2GBP) - This dish was all that was wrong. The gobi Manchurian was slightly stale, the sauce ruined the gobi, and gobi itself tasted like it was undercooked, the cauliflower (gobi) was still a bit hard and the dish just 100% made me wish I could have my 7GBP back, this dish really ruined the meal for me. Rating = 0/5. Sorry for the awful rating, but do not order this dish. 2. Railway Lamb Curry (8.5GBP) - The Lamb was decently cooked, but could have been softer. Whenever I've had lamb curry, it has melted in my mouth, so this was a bit of a disappointment. It was not really spicy, but there was a bit of flavor, could have been cooked longer, and with more flavor. Overall probably would not order it again, but it was decent. Rating = 3/5.SWEET:1. Pistachio Kulfi (2.9GBP) - Although I love Kulfi, and it was good, it tasted like it was a \"packaged kulfi\" and they just unwrapped it an put it in a glass for me to eat. Still delicious, but still not the kind of fresh made Kulfi I was expecting. Rating 4/5. WiFi was good at the restaurant, and the service was solid (sometimes a bit spotty as no one really checked up on our table). Rating 4/5.Final thoughts: Don't go out of your way to eat here. Decent Indian food for a cheap meal.",

Being in SF definitely has its perks and standards. So when I stumbled upon this place with Timeout, I was excited. I knew I was going to enjoy my time here even though the pub next door was packed with people on the sidewalk beer in hand having a good time. We sat in the street level part of the restaurant which served \"street food\"We ordered a fish curry, lamb curry, and chicken curry. Each curry came with it's own starch; rice or bread. The portions are perfect there but being from America we were used to eating a little bit more so I ordered a side of Roti. I was surprised that 3 pieces cut in half came in a basket and even more surprised when they were different kinds! Ambiance was wonderful there was a lot to look at and take in.",

I've seen them at Yelp events and tried a couple dishes from them which were consistently good, so when I was in the area I jumped on the opportunity to go.It was a Friday night so it was packed but since it was only 2 of us we got a seat in around 10 minutes. The ground floor is more of a tapas/street food style restaurant and the downstairs is more classic Indian fare. From what it sounds like the street food is much busier, and for good reason.We decided to get a bunch of plates and bread to share, and everything we ate was delicious. I'd particularly recommend the bhel puri (one of my favourites) and the aloo gobi with roti. All the dishes were of a nice size especially for the price, about on par with a reasonably priced Spanish tapas restaurant, maybe a bit less even. We also had their special Pimms which had rose lemonade in it and was really tasty.Also of note, they have a nice amount of vegetarian options, so go crazy, veggies!",

Step in Yelp Nearby and after a short search (this place is hidden!) I was sure this place was gonna be good based on the street menu and the wonderfully inviting warmly lit close quarters street dining experience on the ground floor. There are two menus here, and it appeared at least to me that most people were here for the street menu. You have amazing starters, from potato chips with yoghurt and pomegranates, chicken lollipops with cool mint yoghurt sauce and even better mains like Railway Lamb and Pulusu Chicken you'll leave here extremely stuffed, full and happy. It's not often I leave Indian restaurants happy with the quality of each and every dish, or the quality of the cooking or meat choices, but everything here was A quality. The dishes are all perfect for sharing, but the Pulusu chicken which I ordered was amazingly soft and tender and very good quality.In all, there were 3 of us, we ordered 3 drinks, starters, mains and desserts. The final bill came to \u00a321 per head incl. tax. Quality food, atmosphere, great staff (apart them forgetting my request for water 3 times and delivering this to other tables nearby). This is my fave indian restaurant in London and hopefully it can remain on the down-low for some time before you'll need a reservation to eat here.There is a dining menu too downstairs which I may try some time too, but that didn't seem as popular.",

I was pretty sure the website photos were different. Oh dear I think... this is not the type of place we were dressed for or what we were really expecting. Fortunately we were swiftly led downstairs to the much more upmarket dining room - Cue the Giant sigh of relief.. Had a great meal here. We tried a number of dishes, the Bengali Crab Fishcakes, a Paneer starter, Butter Chicken, Kozikode Prawns, Palak Paneer, and some lovely Orange and Cumin Tandoori Roti. Overall the food was very good, a little on the spicy side, but lovely all the same. Our Saffronic Gin and Tonics were also excellent. As it was my wife's birthday I was happy to see staff remembered my request for a candle lit cake at the end of our meal (I had mentioned this when I booked through Open table). This was the Cardamom and Chocolate Tart, very nice, but added to the bill all the same..Super meal... no complaints..",

We had a tandoori chicken starter, Zoroastrian butternut chicken dish and also a chicken tikka with rice and garlic naan - all of which were incredible. Service was decent, a bit slow but the staff was very pleasant so we didn't mind. I might try to convince my husband to return again before we head back to the states.",

It was interesting in terms of flavors but if spice is a key ingredient then a must is a side of the chopped chilies. This was provided for heat to taste. I am a sucker for spice with a burn but the subtle flavors were inherent in the cooking style. I dined in the restaurant vs the street food that was offered as a tapas type food fare upstairs. Very enjoyable and I recommend asking the knowledgeable staff for a tour of the offerings. Go for it!",

It's located behind Selfridges making it easy to access and very convenient.Roti Chai has two floors; the ground floor is called \"The Indian Kitchen\" where you get all the yummy Indian street food, set in a very colourful quirky yet incredibly retro Indian d\u00e9cor and downstairs is more of a sophisticated \"Dinning Room\" with dim lights with beautiful table arrangements.check out out the full review on our pagefacebook.com/permalink.p\u2026",

Today was indeed that day!The restaurant is divided into street food upstairs and more traditional downstairs. Both were busy and either choice was a 10 minute wait. We opted to go down stairs where we were politely greeted and directed to a comfortable waiting area.Annoyingly a couple who came in after us were seated first, but upon realising their mistake we were quickly seated in a place set for 4 (we were a couple) in a bit of a hurry we immediately made our order and pleasingly it turned up quickly.The food was ok, portions were just right. My partner always has the same thing in Indian restaurants, butter chicken. Comparatively, it was very good!! I went for a chicken dhansak, this tipped my scale at \"average\" the accompanying bread were all \"average\" also. To summarise, \u00a0the place is welcoming with friendly staff. The food is good but as there price point is at the higher end of what you would want to pay for the cuisine I would want a bit more. If like me you've passed it and thought you should try it..... Give it a go. (Unless your heading towards covent garden, then go to dishoom.... The place this is aspiring to be like)",

Almost every table around me ordered them as well.I had the lamb curry with rice instead. Perfectly spiced and there is nice heat to it! Portion size may be a bit small if you're hungry and didn't order an appetizer. The dessert, almond & saffron phirni, was great ending to the meal. Lightly sweetened, great for not-a-sweet-tooth person. The only reason for 4* is the 12.5% mandatory service charge, no matter the party size. They have plenty of staff walking around and very pleasant to talk to but I am not a fan of mandatory service charges.",

Went here as a group of 3, and at around 8:15 pm; they had a 5 minute wait for the Street Kitchen. They also have a fine dining area, which we weren't really interested in.We ordered some Chilli Paneer for the table, which came after our entrees -- but it was good in a way. The Chilli Paneer's spice level is nuclear. I usually enjoy spicy food, but even I couldn't handle their spice level towards the end.For main course, I tried their Macher Jhol. It was absolutely delicious! I wasn't too impressed with the portion size. At \u00a38.50, I expected a bit more.. but whatever portion was served was absolutely yumm!Definitely recommend this if you are into spicy and delicious food!",

    "text": "Roti Chai is separated into a ground floor street kitchen, serving modern Indian street food specifically made for sharing and a dining room downstairs, serving a more formal a la carte menu. As we fined in on ground floor we can only give our review on the Street Kitchen.So the ground floor was an informal dining scene resembling much like a upmarket canteen with upscaled retro Indian food labels as posters. It had a nice buzzing atmosphere with a good amount of sunlight coming in giving the place a warm vibe accentuated by the warm glow lighting. The other diners in the restaurant were mostly South Asian which must say a lot about the authenticity of flavours. Plenty of staff although nearly always occupied which meant it was hard to get their attention at times. However food was delivered quickly and service was friendly and welcoming.Aloo papri chaatA sensational dish using a wide combination of textures and flavours making each bite as exciting as the first bite. Wheat crisp bases gave it that crunchy texture and held onto it throughout and this was contrasted by the fluffy potatoes and chickpeas soaking up the flavours. Pomegranates gave it a burst of sweetness against the silky plain yogurt whilst basil added a nice refreshing aromas against the lovely hot and tangy chutney and mild sweet spices DhoklaI was very surprised how moist and airy this steamed chickpea cake was. They must have been finely grounded to produce such a spongy smooth texture. It was subtly sweet with a nice light drizzle of tangy chutney on top to lift its flavour Pani puri This dish was quite forgettable and didn't offer much to the palate. The semolina shells were very nice and delicately crisp but with only a bit of potato and only one chickpea in there, you could barely taste it. The tamarind water was too overpowering, even with just a little bit it masked all flavours with its strong sour notes Bun kebabI did really enjoy how fragrant and aromatic the lamb patty was with the addition of spices and herbs in there giving it a good punch of flavour. However the bun was way too thick and dense to allow the flavours to project through, either that or the patty was too thin. A lovely side of tangy chutney to help it along with flavour but still a wasted patty Bombay bhel puri A dish that always gets me coming back to this restaurant. A fantastic mixture of crunchy wheat crisp, puffed rice, spicy red onions mixed in with little cubes of fluffy potatoes, chickpeas and more. It created such a moreish bite with the variation of textures and all in a refreshing tangy tamarind spice.Idli SambarThe most important thing about this dish is getting the steamed rice cakes right and achieving that sponginess to soak up the curry and they got it spot on. They were so light and fluffy that were a joy to eat it with the lovely mild vegetable curry that had its own lovely complex savoury flavours. Quite a thin consistency which made it easier to absorb by the rice cakes. Aloo gobiA side of cauliflower and potatoes. This dish was fantastic and all very well spiced in a thick curry paste making it the most spiciest dish we ordered. It also had depth and complexity in its flavours. The potatoes were incredibly fluffy and with skin on giving it that nice contrast in texture. Cauliflowers were cooked till soft so blended in well with the onions that helps added a nice sweetness to the dish Almond and saffron phirniResembling somewhere in between of semolina and panna cotta with its slight graininess and jelly like texture and milkiness. It was incredible and I love the saffron in there giving it that lovely sweet spiced aroma to it. Almonds finished it nicely by offering it a nice nutty crunch.I do love Roti Chai Street Kitchen. It's a no reservation place unless you come in a large group. But food is served so quickly that people leave in no time so you don't tend to have to wait long. Dishes have room for improvement but the combinations of flavours and textures in some of the dishes just blows me away and keeps me from coming back. They're all so visually stunning too. Prices are very reasonable and it's great that they come in small sizes so you can order a few or lots to share. Great for birthday celebrations too and for those who are worried about spice levels, most of the dishes we ordered were very mild apart from the Aloo Gobi.",

I have had Indian food in other countries as well. Here in London, I don't think anything could be better than Roti Chai. I had prawns in a delicious tangy and sweet sauce and my wife had a lamb dish. The lamb was tender and fell off the bone. We also ordered the Nan with a hint of orange zest. I love Nan in any form and this did not disappoint. We also order drinks an dessert. I had a \u00a0 \u00a0Caipirinha that was muddled with Mango and lime, perfect.

(Garlic naan wasn't available, maybe just in the dining room? Another reviewer noted it was very good)It was very good; I felt I couldn't really taste lamb however. It didn't appear that the basement dining room was open, there wasn't anyone down there when I used the toilet (lavatories) after eating. Net-net I would go back. The fact that it was packed with all the choices around (Selfridges & Marks and Spencer food courts, for example) attest to its popularity.",

The samosas were lukewarm under their cup of cold yoghurt but still crunchy (and tasty, I really liked them). The lollipops were pretty boring to me but the husband loved them.I ordered a prosecco cocktail that came out instantly, which would explain why it was flat and warm. I sent that shit back because come on. Really? The samosas had also come out right after I ordered them, so I guess they just make a bunch of food and drinks at once and then send it out when it's ordered? Lame.My husband ordered the railway lamb curry, which was teeny tiny for the \u00a39 price tag. Kept having to flag down the servers, even though it wasn't too busy (we were heading off to a show so had to leave at a specific time).Bummed out as I had been wanting to try this place out since they attended a yelp event and served a fantastic (hot) chaat.",

Both of these dishes were spicey hot and we were thankful for the beer and water. \u00a0Our entrees were on the milder side, but they were packed full of flavor. I got Malaba Mooli Prawns and my husband got Malai Methi Paneer. We also got some garlic butter roti. The shrimp was cooked to perfection. I have no idea what was in that sauce, but I literally could have licked the bowl. The Paneer was vegetarian. It was made with cheese chunks. Again, you could lick the bowl. The Roti bread was perfect for licking the bowl and looking polite. This was by far my favorite meal of the trip. You know I will be back to this restaurant.",

Bhelpuri had too much tamarind and was sour. The Dhokla was not very fluffy. The manchurian was again a bit on the sour side and lacking sweetness. The lemon juice or nimbu pani tasted more of soda water and ice rather than any lemon flavour. Service was also slow despite it not being a busy night. The only good thing that I liked was the burger. Will not be trying the street food area again. The dining area for which i have reviewed before was a much better experience for me.",

    "text": "Ah !! Another brilliant opening. I heard of Roti Chai from a column by Richard Vines on Bloomberg and I promptly visited at the next available opportunity. How could I not try out a street food joint as good as \"Dishoom\". Yes, it is generally as good. Although \"Dishoom\" serves many more dishes, its soul is Western Indian. Roti Chai on the other hand is pan-Indian. You can try the dhokla from the west and the fish curry from the east. The chaat from the north and the idli from the south. They have a much better variety to offer. The portion of the restaurant that's on the ground floor is meant primarily for snacks, though there are a few dishes that would work for a decent dinner as well. It's open all week and does not take reservations. The area in the basement has a more conventional dinner menu, but it's operational only from Tuesday to Saturday. One can reserve a table at this section of the restaurant. If you are visiting upstairs, I would strongly recommend the \"Hakka chilli paneer\". It's not for the faint hearted. It's very spicy and will test even the most hardened of green chilli enthusiasts (if there are any). The fish curry with mustard was gratifying. Its a tragedy that in a city with so many Bangladeshi immigrants, one cannot find decent Bengali food. This fish curry is a small step towards rectifying that. The dal, the chickpeas and the pulao are good too, but I didn't enjoy the samosa too much. The railway lamb curry is a must have. It's cooked using tender pieces of mutton along with potatoes. The fact that potatoes form an integral part of many curries in India is something that Indian restaurants in Britain have conveniently forgotten. This dish is a timely reminder. It comes with 2 soft, well made chapatis ... very authentic. The chicken chettinad that you can get downstairs is very tasty. I would also order the bread basket which gives you 3 different breads for the price of less than two. The service is excellent. Roti Chai is open till 9 PM on Sundays and the official \"last order\" is at 8:30 PM. I had reached at 8:45. In most places in London that would mean an automatic refusal to serve ... but not here. Strangely (for Europe), doing business and customer satisfaction is high on their list of priorities. Roti Chai is not very expensive. Most people can fill themselves for \u00a325 or less. I have many many reasons to come back to this place (I had my first \"frooti\" in years here) and I shall also get all my friends.",

After reading the glowing reviews on Yelp, the Street Kitchen seemed like a great choice.Service: Front of the house seemed accommodating. The waitstaff, however, was either too persistent in their attempts to take our order or, when we needed them, not attentive enough. There also seemed to be a lack of coordination, as three different people tried to take our drink order. Despite this, we had to ask about four times for some water before any was brought to us (at least ten minutes wait time).Food: From the Yelp reviews, I had high expectations. Sadly, no noteworthy dishes (aside from the chocolate cardamom tart) were to be had. I was also disappointed with the price. I don't mind paying for food, street food or otherwise, if the food justifies said price. But I honestly enjoyed the Indian pre-made meals I have purchased from Waitrose and Tesco more than the food here.",

My husband started chatting up the gentleman sitting next to us (to ask him what he ordered, as everything looked divine), and it turned out it was the owner! The owner was warm, gracious, and funny. He was eating there with an old friend; and they ended up speaking with us for the entire dinner and suggesting various food items. We ordered lamb kebab starters, paneer cheese in a green sauce, butter chicken, roti, garlic naan, a butternut squash starter, and more. Everything was outstanding! We also tried their signature cocktails (a cucumber vodka drink, and a chai spiced bellini). Both were so different from the norm, and were really nice twists to complement the food.The owner very graciously sent over an after-dinner tea with vodka (which i never would have ordered, but was delicious!), as well as homemade pistachio popsicle sticks, which were full of flavor, but not so heavy.We will definitely eat here when we return, and you should, too!",

There are kurkure( strictly Indian commercially available to most of the parts) and Parle-G biscuits( the oldest biscuit in the Indian biscuit history for me) stacked nicely next to the entrance. That's when I fell in love with it's ambience. We sat on the street room. The truck sign on the walls are just one of a kind. We were nicely welcomed and seated quickly in about 15 mins, as promised. We sat next to the kitchen, it smelt heavenly. We ordered about 4 dishes which included 2 appetizers, but they weren't enough. So we ordered one more. We tried papri-chat, it was nice and fresh. The next we had was Parsi chicken which was nothing but ordinary. We ordered two other chicken dishes i.e chicken manchurian and andhra curry chicken, both were very bland and dull. So, I would give it no more than 3 stars",

The chicken burger was really good, interesting flavours and didn't really taste like anything I've had before. The railways lamb curry (which I've seen several people recommend) was not my favourite. By no means was it bad, it just wasn't that amazing in my opinion. Mind you, I was extremely hungover and Indian food may not have been the best call to help cure the hangover. Also a little dissapointed in the lack of naan but this might just be the street kitchen and the dining room does normally serve it. Service charge is included in the meal and I left there spending under 20$.",

The biggest problem was that the server brought the entire meal all at once (from the guava juice down to the curry), and by the time we finished appetizers the main was cold. \u00a0I asked why they did it, and the server said she did it because we didn't tell her not to. \u00a0 Unusual, to say the least.",

I don't really know how to describe paneer in a pleasing way but whatever it's amazing and you should try it. I also really loved the Macher jhol- excellent flavour and just enough spice.

It was like Indian mozzarella sticks in the very best way possible. Not diminishing any of the quality, just want to give a little context. My butter chicken was scrape your bowl clean good.

The hostess told us that we could have a table at the street kitchen in about half an hour and offered us to wait at the bar and so we did.Had a bellini while waiting and my boyfriend had a mango caipirinha and both was excellent. When our table was ready the hostess came and took our drinks and accompanied us to the table. It's recommended to pick 1-2 sidedishes and 1 maindish, but since we we're kindda full from our afternoon tea earlier this day we decided to choose 1 sidedish and 1 main each.Had the chicken lollipops which I highly recommend for sidedish and also the chicken samosas - really tasty. Both had the pulusu chicken for main course and I loved it... My boyfriend found it a bit to spicy though. It was served with rice. We ordered mango fizz and orange blush to drink and both was yummy.

The agni fire wings, were mind blowingly spicy in a good way. But be warned - this is only for chilli addicts. You can't handle the spice otherwise.The manchurian chicken was a let down, especially as it was served with a very thin sauce and plain rice (Its a very Indian Chinese dish, served almost dry and with fried rice) the taste was good, but it was a disappointment purely because of its name. They should call it sweet and sour chicken or something.Brother enjoyed his bun kebab.However, the only thing that really stood out for me was the hot chocolate with its lovely cinnamon notes.Service was efficient and friendly. I might return to check out the chaat items, but for a meal, I'd rather go elsewhere.",

Not the \u00a310 that a small bowl of rice and 2 rotis cost here. I have no problem with paying a lot for good food, but those prices were getting dangerously close to extortion.Then again, the place was packed so maybe i'm just too much of a Tayyabbs fanboy to appreciate food from \u00a0the sub-continent anywhere else!",

I would recommend to try the street food first cos it's cheaper and got more varieties than the dinning one. I ended up paying less than 20 quids (included a service charge).

The food is rather bland for Indian food, and the whole street food shtick has been become rather tired and trite. This must be the universe's way of saying \"beta, don't waste your shillings on such mediocre khaana when you can eat your ammi's cooking and buy her a gift with the money instead\": point taken universe! The cocktails are actually fantastic here, and the few my brother and I tried were delicious, and reasonably priced...the food on the other hand was uninspired. The agni \"fire\" wings were fatty and chewy and as far them being \"dangerously hot and spicy\" per our waitress...mah, me thinks not. The English concept of \"spicy\" is laughable and the general lack of \"mirch\" left most dishes lacking in any sort of real flavor. I'd stop in for drinks and maybe a samosa...beyond that, just go to Dishoom!",

The environment was lively and busy, but not too distracting, service was prompt, and food was amaaaaazing. We loved all our dishes -- So much flavor, spice, and depth! My husband and I tried an assortment of small dishes including the Hakka Chili Paneer salad, which was honestly, my favorite dish. It came with deep fried tofu cubes, green pepper slivers, tomatoes, and fresh chili, all tossed in a savory dressing over lettuce. The chili was fierce, which gave the warm salad a fun kick. Highly recommend going with a group and ordering all the things. Great small plates that make it easy to share, taste, and order more!",

Upstairs is a more casual dining spot (street style might be a stretch though) that attracts yuppies and busy city-folk. Their ambience feels less like a curry house and more a modern, clean place with sophisticated crowds and their menu is short and crisp, a far cry from the menu booklets at most Indian places. Some of their dishes on their menu are distinctive to this restaurant and must not be missed. The Hakka Chilli Paneer, as every review seems to mention, is a must-order for its distinctive kick that settles in well after the first few bites. Would also highly recommend the Idli Sambar (for those with a milder palate) and the Railway Lamb Curry (for a spicier mix). Beware that portion sizes are on the smaller end and this is not the cheapest of Indian food spots.Full disclosure: I might be a tad biased in my opinions because the founder is an alum of my business school :) But the degree is bias is not so much that you need discount the views too much ;)",

So, what is the moral of the story? Don't bring the Singaporean to a yuppie Indian restaurant, because while it was all very tasty, there was too much anise / cardamom in the vegetarian samosas, the wheat flour chapati that was served with the lamb curry was too chewy and the Manchurian chicken completely out of place. Other than that, the lamb curry was tender, and the aloo gobi delightful. Bit pricey, but this is south Marylebone, so I can understand the reasons behind it... Atmosphere's great and the decor of the dining room downstairs was gorgeous. Definitely worth a try, but stick to what they're good, i.e. Indian. :)",

Ever wonder about just how much hotter that 1 chilli vs the 2 chilli dish is? Just ask the waiter and he/she will be more than happy to guide you in the right direction of what you are looking for, and in some cases what you were not looking for but were happy to stumble across.I'd write about what I ate, but I can't remember the names but do remember dipping into a couple of different things that I ordered/ was recommended and also helping myself to a chunk of every plate my eating mate had, whether he wanted me to or not, and I loved all of them. I'd just sit there, ask the waiter what they recommend and just go with that, proved to be a winning strategy for my visit.",

The street food option felt more like a tapas-style place to have drinks and small dishes. We chose the downstairs option because we felt like something more substantial.We got the gilafi seekh kebab for a starter. It was juicy and had a slight sharpness of chilli which I really enjoyed. \u00a0For our mains, we shared butter chicken and malabar prawns. \u00a0We got the roti of the month to help soak up the curries. \u00a0As for drinks, I polished off two beers while my wife had a ginger beer. \u00a0While the curries were good, they were not amazing.The total cost was a bit over \u00a360. \u00a0I liked the meal, but it was too expensive for my liking. \u00a0It could be driven by the location of the restaurant in Marylebone and the expectation for dinner prices in the area. \u00a0I am used to spending less and feeling more satisfied (and full) after a night at an Indian restaurant.",

I dined at both the upstairs (street-style) and downstairs (restaurant) two days in a row. That's saying something...I guess I'll just list what I enjoyed from both since my group tried a whole ton of stuff.Street Kitchen (upstairs)--Hakka Chilli Paneer - Mmmm... fantastic and comes with a lot of veggies.Parsi Chicken Farcha - Pieces of breaded chicken with a wonderful dipping sauce.Manchurian Chicken - Get this!!Hot Wings - Damn I forget the exact name, but I know it started with an 'A', anyways, you need to try them, because they're spicy and amazing!**Tried the Chicken Lollipops & thought they were whatever... nothing special there.Dining Room (downstairs)--Szechuan Chilli Paneer - on skewers and are delicious!Prawn Curry - Forget the name, but this was my favorite menu item! The sauce is to die for!Chicken 65 - Very similar to the Parsi Chicken Farcha upstairsPork Ribs - not bad, a little dry for my taste because I like ribs saucy.Pork Belly - I'm not a huge fan but my friends really liked it.**Gilafi Seekh Kebab - if you like lamb, you might like this. I do not.Roti Chai has really good food and service isn't half bad either. Get the Chai Tea! I couldn't get enough of it. Unfortunately, it only comes by the glass. If you can, try both the upstairs and the downstairs, you can't go wrong either way!",

And am completely and totally underwhelmed.When I got there, I had no idea there was an option of upstairs vs downstairs dining, and that the menus would be different depending on where you were seated. It was only after placing my order for banana chips and lamb curry did I find out about the dining room, where it seems there is a more extensive menu - and perhaps more satisfying dishes because I, personally, did not enjoy my dinner.It was ok, and nothing more. Neither of the dishes I ordered were anything to write home about, and the service - while attentive - lacked personability (as if my waiter was only there in body, going through the motions). I may give this place another chance, based solely on the rave reviews it's getting for its dining room menu... but Im certainly in no rush to go back anytime soon.",

I didnt know any restaurants in the area, I was loaded with shopping bags and I needed food. Now. So I checked Yelp for restaurants in that area and Roti Chai popped up amongst some others. The rating looked really good so I took a quick look at the reviews. Turns out, one of my friends just ate here a couple of weeks ago and left fabulous 5 stars for the place. Done deal, thats where Im going, I thought.And it was a great decision. Staff was really friendly, the food came fast and steaming hot and made my belly a happy camper! I went for the Hakka chilli paneer (pretty hot!) and another dish, but I cant think of the name. Both choices were great and just what I was craving. I would definitely recommend this place. Upstairs is the \"street dining area\" (more for a quick meal and cheaper prices) downstairs you have a different menu and more of a restaurant feeling. Go check it out!",

I had to order the roti (bread) afterwards to dampen the spice but in a great way!

    "text": "I've been to Roti Chai twice. Once for dinner downstairs with a friend and again this week upstairs for a big group dinner. I can now attest to Roti Chai's excellent food and recommend them for large parties too.When I booked our table we were given the option of four menus, two for upstairs (street kitchen) and two for downstairs (dining room). I liked the casual feel of the street kitchen upstairs and preferred the menu there too.Our party of ten started with the Hakka chilli paneer, tandoori chicken pao and the aloo papri chaat. Normally not a fan of paneer, this version was spicy (thanks to the fresh chillies), wonderful and nothing like any paneer I've sampled. I think I had thirds. The tandoori chicken pao might seem like some fusion creation but small bun sandwiches like these are served all over India (particularly in Mumbai where they're a ubiquitous street food). Whilst I thoroughly enjoyed them all, my favourite of the starters was the aloo papri chaat - a flavor explosion brought to you by chickpeas, yoghurt and chutney and something hard to find in my neck of the woods. Overall, I liked the starters slightly better than the mains during our dinner.The standout among the entrees for me was the rustic Punjabi chicken curry. The new-to-the-menu duck leg was also a standout (especially its accompanying sauce). For dessert almost all of us had the mango kulfi. (I mean, who doesn't love ice cream on a stick?) Service was uneven at best (seems most of the staffers were on their first or second shifts) but that didn't but a damper on our meal at all. We got everything we ordered and it arrived in a mostly timely manner.I'd definitely go back to Roti Chai with a big group.",

    "text": "I went a little weak at the knees over a Roti Chai lamb bun at the Feast food fair earlier this year, so I was pretty excited to try out the actual restaurant. In case you were wondering, the name means the equivalent of Bread & Tea - but fear not, there's a lot more interesting stuff on the menu!Step 1 - Find it: It's tucked away on a quiet street behind Bond Street tube, which reminded me I should never walk down Oxford St and ought to do more exploring around it. The ground level street kitchen of colourful Indian signs and posters is kept for walk-ins (or bookings of at least 6), so we'd booked a table for 4 in the more formal downstairs Dining Room to be on the safe side. When we arrived though there was plenty of room in the brightly buzzing Street Kitchen, and as we were after a more casual meal they were happy for us to move up (I got the feeling this happens a lot).Step 2 - Drink: Not to be overlooked - it's an Indian restaurant that actually serves more beers than just Tiger/Cobra! Though I was having a girly girl moment and chose the most flowery thing on the menu with my friend - a rose and lychee martini for two, that arrived in a teapot with 2 baby glass tumblers. I found it a bit weak and there was a lot of ice in the pot, though the novelty cuteness factor carried it. The cartons of Frooti mango juice were also nice to see (just don't think about the mark-up). They do an ok job of the masala chai too, so end with that to aid digestion!Step 3 - Eat: We went for the lots-of-smaller-dishes-to-share option, which is clearly the way to go here. Staples like the bhel puri and papri chaat are done well, and definitely try something in a bun (both meat and veg options got a thumbs up). Meanwhile the hakka chilli paneer was my tastebuds' fave, though the paneer-to-veg-ratio needs tweaking as I got a bowlful of spring onions back after making the mistake of offering it to others first. We ended up ordering a second round of our favourites, though it takes a while to flag down a server so do this as soon as you're running low. Overall have to say I wasn't wowed as there's a few things that could easily be better, but it was all flavoured well and quite authentic.Step 4 - Repeat as required :)",

    "text": "I don't often go to Indian restaurants in London. Maybe it's because I prefer my mother's cooking. Or maybe it's because I'm almost always invariably disappointed. But not this time. After reading the reviews, decided to book this place for a friend's going away dinner.First of all, the place looks amazing (see the pics that I posted). The ground floor has the street food menu, and has a really nice feel to it. I wouldn't say authentic, because emulating the streets of Kolkata is neigh impossible. However there is an attention to detail that makes you feel like you're travelling to another place, another destination. I didn't eat off the street food menu however, and headed straight downstairs to the main restaurant, which is tastefully decorated and a bit posher than the ground floor restaurant.I was immediately surprised to see that they had Sam Adams Boston lager on the menu.... a first for me in anIndian restaurant. For once, I ordered that instead of the standard issue King Fisher beer.For starters, we had the Gilafi seekh kebab, the Bengali crab and fish cake, the Chicken 65 (a variant on Indian indo-chinese food), and okra. It was all very good, although the favourites were clearly the fish cake and the chicken 65. The chicken was super crispy and perfectly cooked, and the hot sauce that it is served with is addictive! One thing that I immediately noticed was that they are not afraid to turn on the heat. The food here is definitely spicy! For the mains, we ordered the Saagwala gosht (lamb curry with spinach), the awadhi lamb rack, the pork belly, and for me, what was essentially the star of the evening, the Kerala duck roast. Let's talk about that duck for a second. I was very worried when I ordered it, because the menu speaks of a duck confit served with a Kerala tangy/spicy sauce. Now I know my duck confit. I make this stuff about once a month for my friends. I'm super picky about how crispy the skin should be, and how easily the meat must fall of the bone when served. Let me just say that they cooked that duck leg perfectly. And the garnish of carrots, the sauce was absolutely divine. Now this is a diwali special, and I don't know how long this dish will stay on the menu, but if you get the chance, do yourself a favour and order it.The sides and garnishes were good, but not over the top amazing. We had the veg kulcha, and the roti, which was good, but hardened pretty quickly and was a bit too dry. The tarka dahl was good, and it was refreshing to see this served. It was spicy and had a decent amount of garlic in it!We skipped dessert and ordered the Masala chai which was excellent. Not too sweet, and perfect balance of cardamom and sweetened condensed milk!All in all, it came down to about 30\u00a3 per person. Won't break the bank, but don't expect a brick lane tab. This is Marylebone.I have to agree with the other reviews about the service. It needs more attention to detail, follow up and diligence. But hey, at least it's not rude,just a bit lazy. The food makes up for this, which is why him giving them 4 stars.I will definitely make plans to go back. Roti chai, together with Trishna (in the same vicinity), have fast become my favourite Indian restaurants in this city.",

Upstairs you can try some typical Indian street food and some traditional mains with a creative touch. I was delighted to find one of my favourite street snacks: pani puri, that's something you don't get in restaurants. It's some spheric, hollow crackers which you fill with a deliciously seasoned \"water\" and then eat in one gulp.The other stuff I tried was very good too, even if the mains were a bit \"rushed\" perhaps, but after all this is a quick eatery not a 3 star restaurant.I like the interior design, sleek yet cosy, with all those colourful Indian billboards.",

If you're looking for butter chicken, this isn't the place to go! However if you're looking for a wide variety of Indian foods from across the continent then roti chai is a great place to check out. Their roti selection is pretty good - some naan, chipatis, and a couple of very good bean stuffed roti that I couldn't identify. The only paneer dish they had was ridiculously spicy in a good way - if you want spicy food it's definitely the dish to try. The trio of chutneys is also good, and their cucumber yogurt tastes cool without being too overwhelmingly yogurt-y. Main complaint is probably the organization. We went on a pretty busy night, and they just seemed like they were crazy understaffed. After the waiter took out order, three other waiters came and tried to take our order again. Additionally, people kept bringing things to our table that we hadn't ordered. We were also charged for still water when we ordered tap, and it took them 15 minutes to get us another order of roti. Service is quite slow if you consider that everything is premade. The staff just seemed like quite a mess, but they were gracious and quick when it came to correcting mistakes. Worth coming to!

    "text": "We (Americans from Colorado) visited Roti Chai (Downstairs Dining Room) during a family trip to London (including three kids and grandparents). Monday night offered a fixed menu with 2-course (\u00a319) and 3-course (\u00a322) options. For a starter, the Malai Chicken Tikka was excellent. This is my favorite Indian dish, and they knocked it out of the park. We all agreed that we would have preferred this as our main course. There were four adults, so we shared our courses family style.Roti Chai has two distinct dining areas, each with its own menu. The \"Street Kitchen\" is on the ground floor (sometimes referred to as \"upstairs\") and offers items such as Chicken Lollipops and Samosas, which were not available in the Downstairs Dining Room. I actually like concept, as it provides yet another reason to come back.Also, we chose this restaurant, in part because some reviews indicated this was a good place for kids. This might be true for the Street Kitchen. However, if you have kids and are eating Downstairs: It might be worth instructing the server to bring out all of your courses at once. There was some confusion about when we were finished with our first course, and this needlessly added at least half an hour to our dining time (which can be tenuous with a five year old).Overall, the Best Indian Food that we have ever had. The Chicken Tikka was amazing (try to get it as your main course).",

The food was good but the menu was small. My Indian dish was a chicken curry. There was too much ginger in it and it made for a spicy but not so tasty combination. \u00a0Overall it was good and i would probably go back.",

I had a rice dish that was a bit unexpected, \u00a0Felt a bit like a fish out of water with the cuisine but we did the best we could. I would definitely try this again for a better pov. Service could use some work. I sat around for a total of about 40 min waiting for service to bring menus, to order drinks, to order and a long time for the check.",

Everything else was top notch too - you'll probably want to order a number of small dishes and eat family style. After all, sharing is caring. Certainly a good place for lunch, as it was busy but not too crazy. Probably worth booking ahead though.",
