I know it is London and they need to make use of every space possible but there is almost no room to move around. The other issue is if you sit downstairs like we did they you get the lovely smell of toilette cleaner and trash coming in to the lower dinning area. As for the food my husband and I agreed almost immediately that we have had WAY better Chinese food at a food court in the mall for a fraction of the price. Overall I strongly recommend you avoid this place. If your looking for really good Chinese food in China town I am sure there are plenty of other options, one that we did really like was WONKEY - Great value, great food, friendly staff.",

    "text": "Part of the famous Four Seasons family of restaurants, this branch is less crowded than its sister located on Leicester Square but the food is no less delicious. I have to confess that I haven't tried that many dishes here, but, honestly, if you're at this place, you're here for one thing and one thing only: the roast duck.I've found roast duck in London a whole different ball game compared to the Far East. For some reason, the ducks here are much fatter, so there's more meat to be had, and, a lot more fat attached to the oh-so-tasty skin. I tend to scrape the fat off as there's only so much my arteries can take, but I will admit that it adds a lot of flavour, life-shortening though it may be!The other barbecued meats are good too; I like the roasted pork while my friend prefers the crispy pork. And the gravy? To die for.Oh, and if you like spicy food, ask for a bowl of chilli oil. It's much nicer than the bog standard chilli sauce option. It's not vegetarian as it's served with dried shrimp (which is why it's so tasty) so, if that's a consideration, please bear it in mind!In terms of atmosphere, Four Seasons is no better or worse than any of the other Chinese establishments nearby, although it may have been a little cleaner than the rest.The service here was decent. Our waiter wasn't rude, he spoke English and he was pretty quiet. As I said, decent.",

    "text": "I was unsure what to expect from the Chinese food here in London, but I must say I was pleased with my lunch at Four Seasons in Chinatown. First off, this area of London is much nicer and maintained than most Chinatowns I have been to in the US, which is several. It does not however ruin any of the traditional market-type feel I personally look for in a great Chinatown experience.Now to the restaurant, there is something comforting about fresh roasted duck and pig hanging in the front window. The entry way is a bit crammed, which I can see being a bit troublesome at busier times. We went here on a Sunday afternoon around 12:30 hoping for dim sum, but it turned out it was not being served. Not sure if this is normal or not, but it was definitely disappointing. Seating-wise it was slightly confined, so be prepared to sit directly next to people you don't know (basically at the same table). Aside from the close quarters the restaurant did not seem overly crowded.For starters I ordered a bowl of Fish Maw soup, which is my absolute favourite. The flavor was great, no complaints whatsoever, but in my opinion it could have either been a bit thicker or had more meat. I was a bit surprised when they only brought out an individual bowl as the menu listed it at \u00a36, and I assumed that would be for the group. I guess that is just London for you though...We also ordered 1/2 a crispy duck for the three of us to share, which could have been more food for the price. It was served shredded with a stack of warm rice wraps and fresh veggies. In all honesty I thought this tasted excellent and the delivery was great. I liked how they gave us the bones too in case we wanted to shred a bit more off (which we did). The sauce was a bit sweet for my taste, but I tend to prefer more salty/savory sauces with meat.All in all, I will definitely be coming back here to explore more of their menu. I will just have to do more research on when dim sum is served/not served next time before coming.",

At Uli's suggestion, we came for the duck, and plenty of fowl was had. The whole steamed fish will run you a pretty penny at twenty quid, but was quite fresh, thought not flavourful. The garlic saut\u00e9ed greens (in our case, Chinese broccoli) were crunchy and tender, a rare and appreciated combination of textures. If you're into salt and pepper pork, their version's not bad.However, as forewarned, the service here was acceptable at best, condescending and irritable at worst. I'm reasonably certain if we were made to feel any more unwelcome, we'd have walked out. It was a razor thin edge. Every single request we made was met with an attitude of disgruntlement, as though it was an extreme burden to bring a clean replacement plate or a takeaway box for leftovers.That's fine. I'm happy to go spend that \u00a360 somewhere else in future.----I'm trying to decide if the three-star review for Four Seasons was as a result of an experiential upgrade due to a rare opportunity to enjoy a rare meal with the ever-lovely Michele D. A teetering four-star sampling of food with solidly two-star service amounts to all-around mediocrity.",

Apparently, Starbucks have a way of calculating when one branch is too busy and you need to open another branch even if it is literally round the corner from the other branch.The original Four Seasons in Queensway is a legend, drawing large crowds for its roast duck. The next branch opened on the main drag of Chinatown on Gerrard Street with the word 'Queensway' in brackets on its shop sign to remind everyone of its more illustrious older sibling.However, not more than 47 steps (yes, I counted them!) from the Gerrard Street branch, you'll find yet another branch of Four Seasons.The roast duck is good but I find the accompanying soya suace a bit sweet. They do offer the duck off the bone, which is a service not found much in Chinatown. My current personal favourite for roast duck though is Tai Ka Lok on Gerrard Street.",

Since it was all so nice and juicy, the rice got flavoured by the meats and it tasted just amazing!Granted, the service is typically Chinese: they want to you to order asap, eat and leave asap so that they can serve the next waiting customers. In other words, don't come here if you want to hang out with your friends and discuss philosophy!

    "text": "NOT peking duck. We asked for a peking duck and instead of saying \"sorry we dont have peking duck\" they gave us a roast duck served peking duck style (pancakes, onions, cucumber, hoison sauce and duck skin). Im pretty sure they still call it peking duck.The duck came out room temperature and the skin was soggy and oily. That sounds worse than it was. If I had been expecting a roast duck except for the not hot part it was pretty good. Even though the skin wasnt crispy it was not rubbery and it was easy to eat. The meat itself was good, but shredded. That is probably because it wasnt a peking duck and that was how they got the meat off the skin.We also had the crisp pork belly which came out chilled, I guess that was the intent. It was pretty good we just werent expecting a cold dish.Afterwards we asked them saying we didnt think it was a peking duck, they said the aromatic duck skin was deep fried so that might be a better choice if you want crisp.Cons:Not peking ducksoggy skinlayer of fat still attached to the skin (with peking duck it disappears)roast duck oilycrisp pork belly was coldPros:Tasted goodnot rubbery so easy to eatmeat tasted good.pork belly was good \u00a0(would have been better hot).All of this was affordable for two adults, 2 children with leftovers @ 56 pounds. The \"peking\" duck alone was 35 pounds",

    "text": "One of many decent places to eat in London's surprisingly small Chinatown. I love how ethnic Chinese businesses exude a certain frenetic efficiency while foregoing mainstream courtesies and this place does not disappoint in that regard. Claustrophobics beware: They sit you wherever there is space. On the crowded lunchtime I visited, when I walked in they hurriedly motioned for me to get in and go downstairs (who knew there was a downstairs?) where there is a small room jam packed with tables and people eating elbow to elbow. They sat me at my own small table that was between 2 others with about 3 inches of space between them so I was essentially eating a communal table with 4 other people. This is a little socially uncomfortable since you are so close to the strangers that you can't help but make eye contact at inopportune moments. This makes for an interesting lunch because you can see what they are eating, watch them pick their teeth, listen to them burp, and wonder how in the hell you are going to safely get out of the place when you are finished without a crowbar. The food was good, not great. To be fair, they seem to be known for their hanging roasted BBQ meats but I ordered some dumplings and a bowl of braised beef noodle soup. It was tasty but I've had better and the portions were a little small for the prices in my opinion. But, it hit the spot, was comforting, made me feel like I was sitting right in the middle of the motherland all for \u00a312.90 which was pricey just for the food but reasonable for the forced people-watching entertainment factor that was included. I would probably go back to try something else off the menu but there are so many other places nearby that also deserve my future attention.",

This is just off of the main strip of Chinatown, at one end towards the W hotel.The meats are what I go here for, the crispy belly pork, barbecued Char Siu and juicy Roast Duck. The Four Seasons group has a reputation for their staple meats and it is deserved.I go to this branch for takeout as it's closer to work (albeit not by much) and it is generally less busy than the Gerrard Street branch. You're getting the same meats and rice and in that respect it makes no difference. Some dishes I think are better in the other branch when eating in though.In the evening, this branch is a little quieter than the Gerrard Street branch and won't have the staff hassling you to return the table for the next group of people. As much as I compare it to the other branch, it's not different enough to warrant the queues of people waiting for a table at the other location. I would suggest that instead of waiting 40 mins plus, head here instead.",

    "text": "I'd like to rate Four Seasons somewhere between a 3 and 4. I went to their Gerrard Street branch for the first time at a friend's suggestion that they had the best roast duck in Chinatown after my mother insisted I bring a whole duck home for dinner (Chinese parents are weird.) It's fairly clear that Four Seasons know their duck. It wasn't covered it in an entire bag of five spice and they seemed to understood the importance of choosing a duck that isn't covered in half an inch of fat. The accompanying sauce was a delicate balance of sweet and savoury. It was based on this first takeaway experience that I returned a short time later to their Wardour Street branch for a dinner with my mum. The plan had been to order one dish of 3 meats (pork belly, duck and chicken) and supplement it with a stir fried green vegetable but in the end we ordered the meats with a tofu dish instead. The meats were delicious and I was glad to see that they were laid on top of a bed of Chinese leaf so there's no need to feel guilty if you don't order veggies. :P the pork belly was crunchy, duck was excellent and the chicken came with an accompaniment of ginger and coriander dipping sauce, Hainan style. All of it tasted great. Even the rice was fragrant and of a higher standard to what I've become used to in Chinatown. The tofu dish wasn't as pleasant as the rest of our meal.I can't recall the name of it but it was a deep fried tofu with a seafood meatball filling, stirfried in a sauce with a few pak choi. It wasn't awful but the sauce was heavy on MSG and cornflour which gave it a gooey texture and unpleasant aftertaste. Not bad but not the best thing to have when the other half of our meal consisted entirely of meat. It was a hot day so something lighter would have been a better idea. Our choice of dish isn't \u00a0the restaurant's fault of course but I still wouldn't order it again. Altogether for 2 people (rice, tea, a meat dish and a vegetable dish) the meal came to \u00a329 including service charge. Of course we got a duck to go after we were done because apparently that's what Chinese mothers need to do. (So weird...) Not bad for the area but for a real bargain order rice & meat individual meal, which comes to about \u00a318 for two + drinks.",

She came back to our table every other minute and take away everything that she \"think\" we don't need. If you want to eat something good and be joyful go somewhere else!!!",

I politely ask for a table for 3 and they say \"okay you all go outside\" in a rude voice while shoving his finger at my face to go outside. Fine we waited outside. 10 minutes later 3 groups came into the restaurant and they automatically got seats (I'm sure they didn't have reservations). I ask the guy about our table. His reply was \"(unintelligible voice) wait\". The food tastes okay compared to the other restaurants in chinatown. They serve very sloppily. Barbecued mixed meat is drowned with sauce. I recommend you try elsewhere in chinatown.",

Spicy here means SPICY.The atmosphere and decor are actually quite poor, and there was a draft from a window that couldn't be closed on the second floor. But if your interest is the food, then you'll not be disappointed.The crispy roast squid and Shredded chicken fried noodles are extremely morish!",

The seasoning and texture of its BBQ pork and roast duck are simply outstanding as far as the London standard goes. A typical meal at Four Seasons would cost less than 20 pounds per person to make this one of the best place for comforting but quality Cantonese food in China Town.",
