(only ordered 3 so was still hungry)By the way--don't know what the previous poster was talking about--this place is on street level so I'm not sure how she climbed down the stairs to get to the bar. \u00a0Just sayin.",

He proceeds to squeeze an entire tube of toothpaste in his mouth, burns his clothes and then cowers crying in the shower. This is how I feel after eating at Lupita. We had the tinga chicken tacos and the carnitas burrito and both were terrible. Of the five sauces that we tried, only one tasted like it had not been poured straight out of a can. The spicy chipotle mayo was insipid and disgusting. To add insult to injury, they charge extra for a side of this slop. The whole place looked like it needed a good cleaning, especially the bathrooms which reminded me of the free toilet you might find at a public park.",

First of all - the service here is not the greatest. Almost impossible to get the attention of the many servers in the restaurant, or remembering to bring your 2nd order of drinks. The manager (some big Mexican guy??) seems on top of his game, but it's a shame about his staff.Anyways, heres the breakdown:Guacomole - actually not bad at all, lots of fresh ingredients and tasted similair to the ones Ive had in Cali.Tortilla chips - not fresh, tasted the kind you buy from the bag. Hard to find a place that actually mkes fresh chips from flour tortillas.Tacos carnitas- lots of flavor, probaby the best thing on the menuQuesedilla with beef? - uses cheddar cheese or something which makes the dish taste a bit sickeningCoffee/espresso margaritas - delicious, basically like a frothy espresso martini YUMConclusion - it's decent and i probably would have given a another star if it wasn't so pricey.",

The friendly bartender downstairs pours great margaritas, and even knows how to make a \"bandera\" a special drink named after the Mexican flag.For the food, the next time I go, I will have to work on my ordering. One of the best starters was a spicy mix of onions and peppers. The tacos (which were the main event we were waiting for) were very respectable but didn't manage to match what we had in Mexico or our favorite taquerias in San Francisco and nearby areas. Sure beats making my own!Gluten-free notes: The corn tortillas are corn-only, but they are prepared in a kitchen that uses wheat flour.",

    "text": "I liked Lupita! We stumbled across it walking up to the Strand from Embankment station and thought -- yeah, why not! It was 5:30 and already almost full, so in we went and sat right down, luckily because 20 minutes later the tables were all full.We got guacamole and I confess I was a teeny bit disappointed in it, though ours was full of avocado and all the other veg, I too felt I'd like to see it mixed at our table so we could call which ingredients we wanted more or less of. But there was lots of it. We had to buy chips, which one should not have to do in a Mexican restaurant, but at least the three salsas were home made and delicious and each different in flavour and heat.I agree that they need to make their own chips, or at least, don't give people the tiny crushed ones from the bottom of the bag because who can use a crumb to pick up some sauce or guac? At least sort them, because if we have to pay for each bowl of chips, each bowl of chips should be perfect!And since chips are one of the most ubiquitous parts of a Mexican meal, they need to be freshly made on site. Really, folks, how hard is it to deep-fry your own corn tortillas? I ALWAYS do that when I'm cooking Mexican at home, because that alone makes people think the meal is amazing. It's so easy and makes such a huge difference, all restaurants that purport to have authentic Mexican food should be frying their own chips, not pouring them out of a bag.That quibble aside (but it's not a small one, Lupita, you really need to change this!!) the food was quite good. However the refried beans came buried under more chips, which we had already ordered another basket of for finishing our Guacamole. Couldn't the waiter have warned us that the refritos were going to come under an avalanche of chips so we could have not wasted an entire basket of them? And I couldn't even dig out the beans. Please don't serve them under chips, keep the two things separate so we can decide how many chips to eat with the beans. I mean, maybe I wanted to eat them with a fork or add them to my vulcan tacos with mushrooms (best part of the meal, BTW). But that was impossible to do. The tacos carnitas (slow-cooked barbecued pork) were terrific, but we had to order our ten year old two plates of them, the portions are so tiny that they are barely even tapas-sized. The torilla soup was the best thing ever!So kind of an up and down experience. We had no problems with the waiter except that even though he looked like a blond surfer (He was, we asked) he had a thick Mexico City accent that made communication a bit challenging. But I like to use my Spanish so that worked out okay.We loved the soft drinks, the Hibiscus Flower and the passionfruit ones were great!The salsas are excellent and varied and the authentic pickled hot peppers were too. We liked it and will go back but there are areas that still need improvement. I hope Lupita deals with them because I'd like to see it become the terrific Mexican restaurant it shows glimmers of being able to be!We had leftovers and my final negative is that when we asked for some way to takeaway our food, they said they don't do takeaway and had nothing for us to put it in. SO I cleaned out the paper coffee cup I had with me when we came in and stuffed it full of pickles, guacamole and chips and beans and took it home that way. But if we pay for the food and can't eat it all at the time, we should be able to take it home, Lupita. Our waiter said they are going to get some containers but just didn't have them yet, so perhaps this area will improve.",

If your only thought about Mexican food is either nachos and guacamole this place may either delight or disappoint. Mexican food and veganism are not exactly kissing buddies, but they made a real effort to accommodate my restricted palette, and had a number of delicious items (the cactus was actually really tasty - much better than the last place I had it). If you are open to carne and other delights, then you should really enjoy yourself. Unlike others I found the service excellent, and found the explanations of the dishes and attentiveness of the waiters first rate. The tequila and Mexican beer selection is also stand-out.

    "text": "Oh Lupita, I had such high hopes for us, I thought we could really be something to each other. But you let me down, like all the rest. Wahaca, you can breathe easy, Lupita will not be coming to steal your undeserved London taqueria food crown any time soon. I was really excited to give this place a try, the menu looks authentic and full of weird and exciting things. Cactus, truffle quesdillas and guacamole that they make at your table. Sadly the food was so mediocre. The cactus was canned, understandably enough. But the guac \u00a0was just a big bowl of onion and tomato with some avocado cubes. Not prepared at our table, though I did see them do it for others. Are some tables more special than others? Let's call it an onion dip because it was in no way guacamole and for \u00a37, I want some damn avocado mashed with effort!After our first round of food, which was so disappointing, we ordered some nachos. After all, who does nachos badly? Lupita. The service was woeful and my companions told me to leave less than the added 12.5% but I am way too non-confrontation for that. They brought the wrong drinks, never explained why we didn't get our guac made for us, forgot my sour cream and just disappeared for ages. On the brightside I love the modern feel of the place and you can sit at the bar if you are by yourself. Maybe you should because the tables are tiny. I know it's new, but it would really need to try harder to survive now that these new 'authentic Mexican' places are popping up everywhere. I'm bumping it to a three because in my heart it's a two star but it's so new you need to give it a chance yourself.",

The flavors of good Mexico City food are all there. Tacos were zesty, authentic and fresh. \u00a0My fellow diners also had quesadillas and boasted its ability to reach comfort food status. \u00a0I'm looking forward to trying one of their pulled-pork specials next time. \u00a0Menu also offers seafood.Portions are not huge but you will also not walk away hungry for a reasonable price.Atmosphere felt a bit impersonal, like that of a chain. \u00a0(Caveat: I went over the lunch hour so the restaurant was filled with business patrons.) \u00a0Service was pleasantly cherry. The service call buttons at each table are genius. \u00a0Adds to the chain feel but this allowed the wait staff to be available without being intrusive. \u00a0 The most hard core of critics may note that the guacamole could use a little more zing and some ingredients could be a little more authentic. \u00a0I personally wouldn't have minded a spicier salsa, but overall, my meal was delicious and I'll happily take anyone who has given up on Mexican food in London.",

It also happens to be in a street with such high footfall that it would be impossible for it to fail no matter how bad it was.But in my book that's no excuse for serving mediocre food and I attentive service.While I appreciate that the guacamole is made fresh in front of you, there's no point in having it because its the most tasteless, bland guacamole I've ever had. Even the stuff you can get in jars in the supermarket tastes better.It's a shame really because I was hoping Lupita would be so much better than it was.It's pricey too. If you want pricey street food, make the short walk to Wahaca where you'll at least get decent food and service for your money...The one saving grace is the Agua de Jamaica is really good here, and they use all the authentic names for the dishes and such.",

    "text": "Being from Los Angeles, I have pretty high standards for Mexican food...and London has disappointed me before in this category. So much so, that I originally wrote off my coworker's recommendation of Lupita.Despite my original snobbery, I stumbled upon Lupita one night soon after making the big move to London. The timing couldn't have been better because I was at the peak of homesickness for LA. The food immediately transported me back. The tortas, tacos, and burritos are just like you'd find in those small taco shops tucked all over Los Angeles that are packed with locals. The salsa is spicy and the meat is very well flavored (I prefer the al pastor). Although the food was a portal back to my local taco shop, Lupita is going for the restaurant feel. Tableside guacamole preparation is a good example of how they are far from fast food. The prices are also quite a bit higher than one would expect to pay at a taco shop...even without converting \u00a3 to $. The price (\u00a315-20/person) can be justified because they get many of their ingredients straight from Mexico.In any case, it is the best Mexican food that I've had after my time so far in London. The service is also stellar. Ken, the owner, is from San Francisco and takes a lot of pride in sharing Lupita's food with customers. \u00a0He gave me some samples and even recommended other restaurants in the area that I need to visit. I'll definitely be going back whenever I need a taste of home.",

Friends and I also celebrated TT#8 at the new Lupita near Brick Lane, and both times, I was undeniably pleased with every aspect of my experience.The food is absolutely amazing, and the cochinita pibil perfectly captures exactly what slow-cooked pork is supposed to be--taking the time to make such a vital component of the Mexican taco menu properly is definitely a highlight.There are lots of options for drinks, and I was pleased to try a new one at the new Lupita opening: the ingredients are a bit fuzzy in my memory (I blame the drink), but I remember it had brown sugar, and perfectly complimented a delicious cheese and chorizo fundito. Their pico de gallo is spicy and fresh, as is the guacamole.The prices at Lupita are standard for London, and it's not unusual to spend \u00a320 without realizing it. However, the service is attentive, and the manager who served my friends and I during our first visit remembered us at our second, despite the new location. It's nice, in a city so big, to be well fed and well cared for in such a way.",

Lupita is on the street I work on, and since I am a massive margarita fan, my boyfriend and I decided to try this out after work one night. The guy who was looking after us was probably the owner, as he seemed really invested in the restaurant, taking his time to explain the menu and how much we should order. His customer service skills were excellent, and he was a credit to the restaurant. We ordered nachos, one taco, one quesadilla and one speciality fish dish to share. all were really really good - most especially the mushroom quesadilla and the classic nachos.My margarita was fantastic! I often think the UK finds it difficult to replicate the margaritas that can be found in America, especially in the south, but they really did a good job on mine. The only negative that I would have about this experience is that when we ordered, the guy told us that it was fiesta hour, and that the cocktails had money off. I asked if this included the margarita and he confirmed that it did. When we received the bill, the margarita was normal priced. We were in a hurry, and because the food and the service had both been very good, we didn't correct this, however, if I were to go to Lupita again and the same thing were to happen, I'd definitely knock off a star and be slightly hesitant to return. I will be giving it a second try, and hope that my second visit will be just as memorable...and will include a fiesta hour margarita at the fiesta hour prices :)",

I also ordered one taco-chorizo con papas. Paid 1 pound extra for cheese. It was small and weird. Tasty. But small. The best part of the meal was the Vatos Locos cocktail I had to go with.

As well, you'll hear a lot of Spanish spoken among the staff in the restaurant.The bad news is that the Spanish is spoken by Spaniards not Mexicans and the food follows suit. Where to begin?- Canned jalapenos- Table salt rimmed margaritas- Cheap chips woefully lacking in flavour, that break too easily and are definitely not freshly fried- Similarly bad tortillas (probably produced in the same factory)Advice (so as to end this review on a high note): Do get the al pastor tacos and look past the tortila and the strange British tasting pork and you'll enjoy wonderfully spiced, authentic al pastor flavours.",

Long gone are the days of \"nug nugs\" and \"CHICKEN IN A BOX\".Last night I was drunk. I was in central London and being rained on. I was hungry and on the hunt for something that would fill my belly and stop the queezy feeling that was coming on and threatening my journey home. Larissa D guided me into Lupita for take out and we ordered something. I say that because to be honest I just remember them looking like tacos and being tasty.The terrified gent that took our order was obviously grateful that we were only ordering take out. He did not want this drunk chicks in his establishment. He's not KFC okay!?So a somewhat filling take out snack was \u00a317, bit of a rip off really but tasty and filling and Mexican enough for me to be satisfied.",

    "text": "- one of the most popular, authentic Mexican restaurant in London (between Leicester Square and Embankment)- opened its doors in Villiers Street in 2010 (by El Farolito)- the word Lupita comes from a Spanish title of the Virgin Mary - Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe - meaning \"Our Lady of Guadalupe\"- nice location with open kitchen- very friendly and quick service- they offer a wide range of dishes from tacos, tostadas, quesadillas and enchiladas to salads, soups and totopos (traditional homemade tortilla chips) as well as some of Mexico's hard-to-find beers including Pacifico, Modelo Especial and Negra Modelo and also a variety of Mexican, South American and Spanish wines- we tried the \"Ensalada de Nopalitos\" which is cactus mixed with tomatoes, onions, coriander, lime and Ranchero cheese (4.95 GBP) as well as the \"Ensalada Maya\" which is mixed leaves topped with grilled chicken breast, crispy tortillas, Ranchero cheese, cactus, tomatoes, avocado, pickled red onion and coriander dressing (8.95 GBP)- as a main dish we had \"Gringa\", a combination of pastor marinated rotisserie pork, bacon and cheese, topped with fresh pineapple, coriander and onions (11.95 GBP)- dishes were really yummy; especially the cactus in the salad was a new experience for me!Conclusion: I liked that place with its open kitchen, friendly staff and good food!",

    "text": "Oh Lupita, I had high hopes for you, but alas, you failed me. On my never-ending quest to get Mexican in London, we tried out Lupita. It smelled good coming in and the menu looked great.We ordered the premium margaritas. Which were better than most places, but the balance of flavor was a bit off. They were a tad too sweet, which is strange given the ingredients. It didn't stop us from finishing the pitcher though.For starters we got guacamole and what I thought was going to be nachos, but was just beans, meat, guacamole and a bit of cheese on top of chips. Unfortunately, neither of them was really outstanding. The guacamole was bland. Which is impressive because I make it at home and I can't understand how it can turn out so bland. In fact, my guacamole was ridiculously better than the stuff made here. The nacho-like dish was alright, but also a bit bland. Salt. The key to Mexican is salt. Beans need salt. Avocados need salt. Unfortunately, the lack of salt in the dishes was severely obvious.For mains I had lengua (beef tongue) tacos. The tongue was really chewy. The menu claimed it would be slow cooked, but I don't really think it was. Nava ordered beans with chorizo as a side, and again bland. I ordered the side of chiles because I thought it might spice things up a bit. The waitress warned me they were really really really really really really really hot. And they were. The chiles were the best thing there. Adding them to my tacos (and basically everything else on the table) really made everything better. Which is disappointing because they should be able to get the spice levels right.When the waitress asked me what I thought of the chiles (and by this time I was loving them and my face was read and tears were slowly dripping out of my eyes), I flat out told her that they were amazing, but I had to add them to my food to make it better because everything seemed a bit bland otherwise. She agreed. That's not a good sign. When the waitress tells you that everything would be spicier if it were in Mexico, but they cut back because of the British palate, you know there's a problem.It just didn't do it for me unfortunately, and won't be coming back here any time soon.",

But all I remember was the smallest tacos I ever seen in my life (which were not much bigger than my palm), the taste was ok, but the tacos were soaked with liquid (from the union and tomato?). The tortilla chips were a bit hard for me, my friend kept adding salt to the fresh avocado dip to make a better flavour. I don't know... The drink was good though.

I tried a few things that others' had ordered (a habit I have picked up from Mrs K) and they weren't that much better. At the risk of sounding like more of a (s)nob than I undoubtedly already do, having been to Mexico and lived in SoCal, I was expecting the food to be a lot better.I must say though that the Guac they gave us with the tortilla chips at the start was amazing!",

She was thrilled to find out there was one here being that there is also one in San Francisco, her home town. We had to wait a few minutes which was not a problem so we asked if we could order a pitcher of margarita. They were fine with it and put it in for us. Obviously, they forget being we waited nearly 20 minutes for it.It took about that much time as well to get the waiter, Javier's attention to place our order. Three of us ordered the enchilada verde which he messed up and gave my friend, the birthday girl, the wrong meal. It took a good 20 minutes to get the bill. We would call a waiter over and rudely tell us that \"they could not help us\". \u00a0Finally Javier comes over and still has the wrong meal on the cheque. He goes ahead and fixes it. Then comes back 10-15 minutes later with the other cheque.Another waiter was so friendly and came over and helped us being Javier was nowhere to be found. \u00a0We pay what we had to pay and got ready to leave. Javier runs over accusing us of not paying the bill. We told him we did and left. \u00a0Javier followed us outside down the street yelling at us telling us we did not pay when we did. We just walked off and he told us to \"F*** off\". Now really, is that how a waiter should behave? Never going back. Ever. As long as Javier is working there.Oh yes, and Javier asked us if we were going to pay the service charge. Pathetic.",

I'd have never had guessed her first suggestion would have been a Mexican restaurant.But she raved about it, saying they flew the avocados straight over from Mexico and there was mention of deep fried cheese. Basically, I was sold pretty quickly. Also, it's always nice to go somewhere with a semi-expert. This teeny tiny bar was jam packed on the Thursday we went in. But the staff were happy and friendly enough and said we could have a drink from the bar and a menu while we waited. We were quickly sat at the bar, where you can see everything being made by the chefs. Not the best place to sit when you're a tad peckish, but a great view otherwise. We shared some fried cheese and guacamole and I ate a delicious Tuna Taco. I must admit, I came away a tad hungry and a little more skint than I'd hoped (the Corona's were a little on the expensive side) but everything else from the food to the view to the waitress were top notch.Would love to go again.",

The food was good; the cheese crisp (Chicharron de Queso y Guacamole) we started with was sooo good: super cheesy and crispy! I had the Campechano tacos, and they were tasty; the mix of meats went together well. The normal salsa they give you isn't particularly spicy, so if you love spicy food, have them bring out the habenero salsa. It's spicy enough to bring a tear (or three) to your eye, but it actually adds a good flavor, too. My margarita was tasty, and our service was fast and friendly. We'd definitely eat there again next time we visit London.",

I used to graze on a few small dishes but now the offering seems limited compared to before with things being biased towards the \"old favourites\". Saying that, the burrito I had was tasty, had a good amount of marinaded beef in it and left my hunger satisfied.

We walk closer to see that it was a Mexican restaurant and completely packed even at that time of the night. I immediately check the yelp reviews and realize that I have come in the right place (more than 70 reviews and mostly 4 and 5 stars? You can't go wrong).A friendly, pretty Latina escorts us to a table near the window and hands us the menu (the quirkiest one I have seen). The menu was absolutely confusing because everything on it sounded delicious. I stuck with tacos and ordered a beef and cheese taco with guacamole (It was the best guacamole and tacos I have ever tasted). We also ordered for a Brazillian Spiced cocktail and I have to say that I have never tasted something like that before (It had tequila and some Brazilian liquor) because it was spicy, salty and sweet all at the same time! The music and the ambiance is an absolute winner, it immediately gets you in the fun and loud Mexican mood! I am not going to complain about the price and portion because the food and service was totally worth the amount we paid (It is not ridiculously expensive but definitely not as cheap as Bar Burrito). Verdict: If you want to try the best Mexican of your life then definitely try this place!",

He must have been right, because everyone in our group wiped our plates clean!Our meal started with a guacamole demo performed by a genial member of the staff. In my opinion, there are few things in the world better than fresh guac! Then we all ordered a round of cocktails. I ordered the ludwika paleta. I don't know what that means, but it must translate into yummy and refreshing strawberry cocktail.For the main course, I ordered a tuna tostada and tortilla chips served with half of an avocado stuffed with shrimp. I must have been eating with my eyes, because I couldn't finish both dishes! They were both delicious, though. My only complaint is that our waiter was a bit slow.While I am definitely a fan of Lupita, the prices are not budget-friendly. If I'm going to blow money fast for Mexican food, I might go to Wahaca instead because it has a bigger menu.",

When we brought this to Antonio's attention he fetched a dustpan and brush. Whether he intended to brain the mouse and then sweep it up or catch the critter and release it elsewhere we did not find out as it did a runner. Later either the same rodent or its cousin appeared and tried climbing up the face of the kitchen area. No action was taken, save a few worried faces from the staff. The food was OK ,however a 12.5% service charge seems a bit steep when they failed completely to deal with the mouse problem , which apparently is endemic \"due to it being an old building, near the River\". Let's hope the food preparation areas get a good clean each morning after the rodent revelries of the night before! It has to be Wahaca from now on.",

My dad and I stopped in here because it was open late and looked like a good spot. Unfortunately, the food was pretty mediocre and the portion sizes are very small (but in their defense, our waitress warned us about that and made sure we were still okay with eating there). I got a vegetable burrito and I liked that there was more than just the normal beans rice lettuce tomato etc. - it had grilled veggies that were still hot. I'm not sure exactly what kinds but it's much better than a normal vegetarian burrito. My dad got steak tacos and said they were so so. Basically, if you are really craving Mexican food, this place would give you that fix but it's not somewhere I would rush back to next time I'm in London.",

From outside Lupita seemed fairly busy, and most importantly, warm. We walked in and were immediately greeted by a hostess that sat us right away. She could probably sense the exhaustion and hunger we conveyed and asked what we wanted. Without any thought, I said I'd have a Margarita, on the rocks, and my sister wanted one as well. As sipped our yummy Margaritas we perused the menu. Everything looked great. We decided to start with guacamole. It isn't a Mexican meal unless you have some guacamole. The guacamole was good, and a perfect start to our meal. I then ordered a chicken tinga quesadilla. The quesadilla was exactly what I needed. It filled and warmed me up. My sister got chicken tinga torta and enjoyed it as well.I was actually really impressed with Lupita once I was done with my meal. I knew London had good food, but I didn't know if they'd be able to make good Mexican food. I really liked my experience and meal, and would definitely visit again given the chance.",

California is lucky enough to share a border with Mexico and share some amazing restaurant. One of my longest quests has been finding good Mexican food in London that can hold up to the dishes back home. Last night I tried Lupita for the first time and overall I really enjoyed the experience. The food came out very quickly and the portions look very small. However I was surprised at how filling everything was. Every dish had its own flavour and nothing was bland. I wish there was sour cream instead of creme fraiche but c'est la vie.I had the sopa de tortilla which was very delicious and a very generous portion. I also had a refried bean and avocado quesadilla. The quesadilla was packed full of delicious cheese and avocado and the refried beans were really nice. They had a great texture and weren't too watery or dried up. My sister had the cactus and avocado salad and carnitas tacos. She enjoyed both dishes very much. We also shared some homemade tortilla chips with guacamole and salsa. The guacamole was very nice and the pico de gallo was fresh and flavourful. All washed down with some yummy cocktails. The service was pleasant and the decor is nice (although look out for the glass screen by the toilets it's easy to miss and walk into).",

    "text": "It's interesting...Mexican food is \"all the craze\" right now in London. Who would've known? It's that California influence (and I'm proud that my ancestor's cuisine is appreciated in so many parts of the world). Having said that, the ingredients here are just not the same. The tortillas are rubbery and too thick...they are missing an ingredient and I'm not sure what it is. Their totopos (tortilla chips) are sometimes made with flour tortillas. Wha?!!! No...no...NO.Anyhow, having been to a few places searching for the Mexican spot where I will get my fix over the next 2-3 years while living in London, Lupita makes the list.Good things: Salsas served with the tacos are authentic and good. Tacos are a B-. Haven't tried the burritos. The tortilla soup is yummy. Good wine list. Cheap. The bad and the ugly: Very limited menu. Regular drinks (like a diet coke) are ridiculously overcharged (2.45 GBP for a diet coke -- for those not familiar with the current currency exchange rate, that's $3.19 for a small bottle of diet coke, no refills. Crazy town.). Tortillas used for the tacos are stiff. Rice is not authentic at all.",

Definitely more Mex than Tex Lupita has an air of authenticity serving up fresh, colourful and very tasty Mexican street food. The menu isn't huge but there are plenty of options for vegetarians. You can check the menu out online and also find the location of their other London branches, Shoreditch and Kensington I think. Our waiter was excellent and orders were relayed to the kitchen via ipad. Keeping with the electronic theme, each table had a device with a button which called the waiter and another button to request the bill. What a revelation! No hanging around once you've finished and want to get on with seeing London. Hurrah! Very convenient location even for those on the south side of the river as its alongside the pedestrian bridge. I'll be back!PS On Mondays to Fridays there's a lunch special. Watch out for Yelp check-in offers!",

After all even Chipotle which I thought would be a godsend of comfort isn't quite the same here. My tastebuds were feeling ever so bored without spicy foods to tantalise them. Thankfully a friend recommended Lupita. The restaurant features an open kitchen so you can watch the chefs at work. I sat around on a bar stool and noticed that homemade salsa had been placed at each seat. I had an order of the guacamole with chips and the tinga de pollo tacos. The guacamole portion felt rather small for the price but was full of flavour and all the right amounts of lime, onion and tomato. I personally prefer my corn chips as light as a feather so these ones were a bit dense and hard for me but nonetheless still tasty. The chips were a homemade and a good sized portion. As for the tacos? Pretty perfect! The meat was tender with quite a bit of heat paired with smokey chipotle sauce and a creamy avocado wedge. I also ordered a horchata which is a sweetened cinnamon rice milk. Thankfully they made it traditionally without dairy as many restaurants tend to cheat. It was a tad too sweet and I wished it was a little more cinnamon-y but I still enjoyed it. Will definitely be coming back here to satisfy my Mexican cravings.",

In London! \u00a0Sounds great! If only we knew....We were seated promptly, but then the staff seemed to forget we were there. We pressed the service disc on the table... no response. One more time, then someone came. \u00a0We placed our order.Some time passed (maybe 25 minutes), and we're getting hungry. We asked the server where our food was, and were told it'd be here shortly. \u00a0The place wasn't very busy.More time passed (at least another 10). \u00a0We asked again. \u00a0Again, \"It'll be here shortly.\"Finally after a few more minutes, my wife decided we were done waiting and walked out with our son. I gathered the backpack and followed, which prompted a very quick response from the staff. They asked where we were going. I responded that we were tired of waiting, and that it should take around 40 minutes after ordering to get our food. I'm from California and go to a lot of Mexican restaurants, so I know whereof I speak. He told me our order was almost done. I told him that I'd heard that already a couple times and that this type of service was horrible. Quite a few other customers heard me. \u00a0After that, I headed out after my family.The only upside of going to Lupita's? \u00a0Since we didn't eat there, we did discover a nice little chain place nearby called Itsu. If it hadn't been for the horrible experience at Lupita's, we might never have found them. \u00a0Itsu was fantastic.",

Notwithstanding the fact that Mestizo in Hampstead Rd has been around for years, there's nothing authentic about this place. The food is a pale imitation of real Mexican fare - flavours are bland, portions are small, and it's expensive. To top it off, the service was truly awful - after sitting there for 15 mins, we had to ask several staff before anyone took our order. Then, half of our order was forgotten about, and the other half they got wrong. After another 20 minutes of waiting, we asked for the bill and left, still hungry.",

    "text": "Lupita is a small restaurant just steps away from embankment and charing cross stations, the deco has a modern mexican feeling to it without loosing the simplicity of a real mexican taqueria. I arrived there with my girlfriend and just seconds after sitting down a very overwhelming and overconfident waitress literally pulled a chair and sat next to us she started an awkward conversation while waiting for our order. We ordered a few dishes; the ceviche tostada was lonely in the plate compared to the 2 portions that other mexican restaurants like wahaca serve, the fish was tasteless and not marinated enough so it was still a bit raw. After that I had a new dish on the menu, tacos de birria; typically the feeling is a tender lamb marinated in a chilli sauce but it almost seemed like it was just a chunk of flavour less meet straight from the oven, after that we had some arrachera tacos, our mistake while ordering this dish was that we ask them with cheese and the whole taco was flooded by it, the flavour of the cheese took over and it was not as enjoyable, one important remark is that the taco portions are 2 per serving compared to the 3 portions or even 4 in other similar restaurants. Finally the best part of the food was the quesadilla lupita; very good and tasty with a rich filling of exotic flor the calabaza and mushrooms and the frijoles refritos side with chorizo, the chorizo was simply amazing you really have to dig in away from the overloaded tortilla chips to get some but the taste is absolutely superb. Drinks were very well done, the agua de jamaica (hibiscus) is one of the tastiest I've ever had in london and the michelada I always go for was well done. Overall it was a good experience.",

The rice was decent. The tacos... two to a plate for a slightly high price (for tacos). Only one pseudo-tortilla for each taco, which is super soft (uncooked) so it breaks easily. I had both the chicken and nopales tacos. The chicken was really dry. I'm not sure how to describe the nopales. They were a bit on the soggy side. The only thing I really liked was the salsa verde. It made the tacos taste more like tacos. If you're looking for a decent \"Mexican\" meal, I guess this would suffice. The only authentic taco place I've had here in London was from this taco stand called Tacos Jalisco in Camden Town 2 years ago. I've been looking for him but sadly, I don't think he's around anymore. As a Mexican-American from Southern California, I'm a bit disappointed that London is deprived of authentic Mexican food.",

We had a great night and felt very comfortable. The food was amazing with very interesting flavours, and different to what we were used to. I especially enjoyed the margaritas! Therefore I was really surprised to come across some of these comments. To aherring16: WOW - has Wahaca spent its whole marketing budget for the year already that it has had to resort to this? If you are not someone that works for Wahaca, then what has Lupita done to you to make you this vindictive and bitter? Out of curiosity I went to your profile and see that you have only reviewed twice - once for Lupita saying it was the worse place, and the SAME DAY reviewing and glorifying Wahaca. PEOPLE - Wake up and smell the G-wahaca-mole... Do you have any idea of the damage these kind of reviews can do to a business, especially when it is ALL RUBBISH? Are you trying to help close a business? To state that it is MICROWAVED TEX MEX is slanderous for starters. How can can you say this, when the food is cooked in the central kitchen in full view of everyone. Lupita is owned and run by Mexicans whilst Wahaca was started by an american lady who went to Mexico once, liked the food and then won Masterchef (all credit to her) If you had such a bad experience at Lupita, did you inform the manager on duty of your dissatisfaction and give them a chance to rectify the situation for you? Normally, people complain, get a free drink and get on with it.On the occasions I have eaten at Wahaca, sure, the food was ok, but it felt like any other chain restaurant. Given the choice, for me Lupita would win every time, especially on authenticity.For anyone reading these reviews, I would recommend trying Lupita for yourself and making your own opinion.",

    "text": "Finding myself in need of a bite and in the Villiers Street area I figured I might as well go check out Lupita: any opportunity to check out a potential new source of burritos has got to be a good thing, right? In summary, \"Okay\". What these guys served up under the description \"burrito\" was not anything approaching my understanding of what a burrito is. A toasted wrap, perhaps. Seemingly a small example, but with London being a hotbed of burrito availibility right now, this is a crucial thing to get right. I asked for no tomato, and the waiter to his credit tried to make it all better by offering me a 15% discount after he forgot to tell the cooks not to add tomato. In hindsight there was so little tomato on the thing anyway it made little or no difference. And come to it, the wrap was reasonably tasty. But a burrito it were not. The corn chips to start were very nice, and not Doritos out-of-the-bag like I thought they might be. And again, to their credit, to make amends for screwing up my order the waiter gave me a free raspberry sambuca shot. Which was weird. As was the music, which seemed to be less about trying to create any sense of enjoyable ambience for the customer, and more about listening to stuff that the kitchen staff wanted to listen to as they worked. It seems wrong to mark Lupita down so much when the waiter was obviously so penitent about slightly mismanaging my order, however to distinguish yourself in the centre of London you've got to be Good. And this wasn't Good. Not Bad, but definitely not Good.",

Whenever I go I always ask for the carnitas tacos (slow cooked pork traditionally prepped with a sprinkling of cheese and a dolop of salsa) they are the best!!! And the waiters are really friendly and I suspect native to the food they are serving so they know anything you may want to no about the food! And so I think lupita well deserves the 5 stars I have given it!!! Make sure to give it a go, it's worth it!!!",

    "text": "I understand why others like Lupita -- if you haven't been fortunate enough to stumble upon other authentic Mexican restaurants in London (both of them), then Lupita can appear like a beacon in the mist. Pros: Service is friendly, and the atmosphere is fun/bustling. Better food than Wahaca in nearby Covent Garden (albeit we're talking about two different types of Mexican cuisine). Cons: The tacos are not as flavourful as Boho Mexica; for example, the carnitas were bland at Lupita compared to the melt-in-your-mouth conchinitas, served appropriately with a sprinkling of pickled onions to add an extra zing. Price-wise Boho Mexica now looks much more reasonable next to Lupita. For other dishes, Mestizo is multiple tiers above what Lupita offers. The tray of dips offers a watery and tasteless avocado option that pales next to the potential of guacomole derivatives. And where's the horchata???",

All of the food was delicious - I had the steak quesadillas on the waiter's suggestion and they were amazing! For dessert - you have to have the churros with the cajeta and not the chocolate dip. Most delicious churros I had ever had! The atmosphere was very fun and all of the staff were so nice. Plus - they serve until pretty late!",

Last time I went with a vegetarian friend and we had the vegetarian platter for two which, at \u00a318.50, is quite expensive but gives you an extraordinary amount of very nice food. The margaritas are also very very good. The only real downside to Lupita is that the atmosphere isn't great \u00a0it's crammed full of tables and is quite noisy. The downstairs is a bit quieter but still not great. Given the food, though, I don't care!",
