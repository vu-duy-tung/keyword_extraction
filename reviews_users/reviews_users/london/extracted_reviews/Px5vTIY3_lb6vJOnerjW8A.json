Originally a 1950's cafe, the place was the pulsing heart of the swinging 60's hippie music and culture scene, with the club downstairs hosting Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and Jimmy Hendrix to name but a few. They have an informative and interesting history section on their website that you should check out, it'll make your trip there even more special. The club is available to rent out, and still hosts live music. The crowd is very laid back, arty, hippie and generally very attractive. The food menu is sensational with burgers and steaks a plenty, but the place is most famed for its wine list. I cannot claim to know anything about wine other than i enjoy drinking it, but i am assured that their cellar is the stuff of dreams. Check their website for full details. They also have poetry evenings, and the whole place just feels magical. Since moving East i haven't been visiting here as much as i would like, and just writing about it makes me nostalgic - i know where I'm off to tonight!",

    "text": "A bit hidden and a few more tube stops than anticipated but definitely noteworthy. Walking through this little pub is like taking a magical journey through Narnia's closet. The first room you enter has a plethora of old antique instruments hanging from the ceiling, which screams history. Keep walking straight through and you will uncover a tiny little garden in the back. It's ridiculously cute and compact but romantic, if that is what you desire. Come back inside though and there is another seating area, on the other side of the bar..that is a tad bit more secluded than the first. Hold on to your hats because Thursdays are hats day, apparently. One of the regular happy hour go-ers advised my friend and I that when you wear a hat, you get half-off your drinks. Not sure if that's true or not but they did come in with more than enough hats to share! With the history and compactness of this cafe, it's no wonder they have adapted a family like atmosphere. One where the servers as well as the customers are seemingly extremely close and comfortable with each other. The food isn't bad - a little overpriced for yogurt & fruits but not bad nonetheless. As for the drinks, you need to come back for happy hour. That being said, go with the Mojito. Can you say, yummy? Apparently, this place is popping when it comes to nightlife. I personally haven't had the opportunity to experience the artistic goodness but I will soon enough. FYI - they host private parties..fit enough for the Prince. Literally. I've been told that the Prince rented out the entire cafe last year. Pretty cool, huh?",

There's a brilliant eclectic, quirky charm to the place and a bustling yet relaxed atmosphere. Table service was mostly attentive but there was quite a long wait for our orders. Price-wise, generally it's pretty expensive. \u00a313 for a plate of buttery (slightly too oily) gnocchi with a sprinkling of parmesan is a bit much. A Martini is a whopping \u00a310however, a huge jug of mulled wine (easily 8 glasses) is only \u00a318 so that made up for it. The waiter even swapped the last third of it for fresh, warm stuff when he noticed it was going cold. The food definitely lets the place down. There wasn't much that appealed on the menu and not much choice anyway. They only do about 5 desserts, too of which are basic ice creams, one is a sorbet and the one most of our table wanted was Churros, which they'd run out of. So I almost gave it a 3*, but the interior design effort and effortless shabby chic of the place saved it. Would still go back there, especially to try out the music venue downstairs.",

Coffee is bitter, service is pleasant when you can get it, but food really does leave a lot to be desired. Who serves a muffin with salmon and poached egg without offering hollandaise?? Or bacon, even when requested super crispy was still a grey-ish white and pink, chewy and too salty. Forget eating, save it for a late afternoon drink, or one of the music events and you may just enjoy this interesting venue.",

Awful. Basil Fawlty awful without the laughs. Why is this? I am not too sure, but has to be from the top down. Sultry, moody, overworked, inefficient. So why go back? Well it has a charm that is inspite of its failings. It has a shabby chic that stems from its bohemian philosopher past. Or as its website says 'The last 50s coffee house in Earls Court with a proud history as a low temperature centre of courtesy, peace and artistic energy.' The menu is predictable but works just about. The food is unambitious burgers and generous 'heart attack' breakfasts. The seating dense and generally benches and stools. Take a paper or a good book. Stop the clock. Relax and dont expect any pleasantries. Go prepared and you will just about enjoy a uniquely boho moulin rouge candles in empty wine bottles type of evening.",

My favourite time to go is breakfast (or brunch, though that's a lot busier): I think those meals provide the most value for money, and is when the bustling, cluttered, multi-roomed bohemian vibe works best. I'd agree that the service isn't super-fast and efficient here, but I've not found it as bad as some of the other reviewers. I wouldn't go here if I was in a rush, though. A liesurely breakfast reading the papers or a couple of drinks in the evening is the best use of the place, in my book. They have live music downstairs in the evenings, typically of the folk/coffeehouse variety (some stars of the '60s played here back in the day, I'm told). The toilets downstairs are in an interesting layout. Check out the deli next door (qype.co.uk/place/120482-\u2026) which sells many of the dishes and ingredients they use here in the caf\u00e9, plus lots more.",

It has a kind of slightly messy and casual look (in a good way) and can get busy with people squished into the seats and stools. I suppose that is part of the charm of a venue where you can meet a few unfussy friends for a coffee and maybe a bite to eat over a long chat. I disagree with others about service. Its just relaxed, not bad. There's also the live music area downstairs which has a similar long tradition. I'd say this place is more about soul than external appearances. Chill and Enjoy.",

Staff are moody and it tends to take a while to get served. I usually come here for the music, which used to be generally always excellent.

The restaurant is classy but inevitably pricey - the punters and artists who frequent the downstairs venue will rarely be found upstairs eating before the gig! However, it is worth it if you feel like pushing the boat out. The venue itself is spacious but feels intimate with the stage being located in the corner. The audience is knowledgable and gives all of the artists a chance and there is a compere on hand to keep things ticking over. As the gigs finish and the late bar continues, the room tends to fill with the trendy teens of chelsea, but the atmosphere just manages to stay on the right side of pretentious! This is a good place to know if you fancy music out west, as earls court is pretty starved of artistic outlets...",

It's almost impossible to convey the immense character of this place. It's a moody cafe come live music venue laden with quirky features and a lived in, labrinthal feel. Maybe that's why it attracts a creative sometimes eccentric seeming clientele. Even the serving staff seem to have been shipped in from another planet. They are no pre-programmed automatons. Instead here are individuals who you can easily imagine penning a few chapters of a book, or a few bars of an opera between capuccino orders.The modern British food is reasonable and varied and the place can be busy and loud in the evenings. My tip is to visit the Troubadour solo, mid-week. Take a book, have a 3-hour coffeeand a enjoy a slice of offbeat London life.",

    "text": "Whatever the time of day and whether you have thousands in the bank or only a few pounds, it is well worth spending a spare hour or two in The Troubadour. The Troubadour is a bar/coffee house/restaurant on Old Brompton Road, a few minutes walk from Earl's Court tube station. It is open from 9am to midnight every day. The place is decorated with a huge variety of objects ranging from stringed instruments and adverts to photos of Shackleton's 1914 expedition. Underneath the main cafe area is the Troubadour Club, a popular live music venue but I have to say I've never made the effort to enjoy what's on offer there. However, I have eaten breakfast, lunch and dinner in the cafe (not all in one day I hasten to add!) and enjoyed drinks there a number of times with friends. Although the food is not outstanding, there is a wide selection to choose from and it is good value for money. The drinks are pretty good too - it is worth noting that having been here a number of times over the years with friends and family, no one I've been with has ever complained! If you're lucky enough to have one or two friends who aren't too self conscious and easily embarrassed, you can get a free dessert on Tuesday if you wear a hat of some description. I didn't think they were serious about it but we came wearing hats one Tuesday and were treated to a delicious free dessert so it's worth a try. To be honest, my favourite thing about this place is the atmosphere. Unlike so many places in London you can come as you are, sit drinking cappucinos and reading a book and no one will push you around or try to hurry you out. It is a great place to relax and enjoy reading a novel or catching up with good friends. Check it out troubadour.co.uk",

I have been to the troubadour over the years many times. And it has been pretty consistent. Good food, good wine, great music.

My friend ordered those while I ordered my go to, Eggs Royale. Now, I'm a poached egg snob. It's one of my favourite foods and I do judge places harshly if my yolk is not completely runny. In short, my friends was highly impressed with her dish and my eggs were perfect. The staff were friendly and the inside was decorated in old-time cast iron tools and skillets, which amused this old Kentucky girl. It also made me want to buy one as I need a cast iron skillet. But that's another story. I'm definitely going back to sit in the garden out back, which looked lush and shaded on a nice day.",

Of course when I told my mother about it she replied \"You know Jimi Hendrix and Bob Dylan played there, right?\"We walked in and waited maybe 15 minutes to be seated in the little cafe upstairs. My boyfriend and I shared the coq au vin, which I believe was a special that night. It was absolutely delicious! One of the best meals I had in London. After dinner we wondered downstairs, bringing our drinks with us, and paid a \u00a35 cover to get in. The room was dark and crowded but not overly so, with everyone focused on the small stage in the corner. The atmosphere was perfect, very lively and inviting. We had a few drinks and watched a couple of really great bands preform (The Huxleys in particular).I really loved this place and I highly recommend coming here should you find yourself in Earls Court!",

I just came here for a glass or two of wine. Their merlot is very light for a red wine and goes down smoothly. The atmosphere is very English home turned into a pub who wants to be a cool wine cellar. The maze to the toilets was bizarre and I'm sure more difficult once you've had a few. Next door you can buy their wines to take home.I'd definitely hang out here more often if I could.",

By day, this place serves up delicious meals (upstairs) and highly rated coffee while patrons lounge in mix-matched chairs alongside antique tables. Like an English home, there are many rooms, random mini-stairs, and much more space than you would originally imagine. By night, the upstairs bar serves all sorts of drinks (their mojito isn't bad, but when there with friends we would tend towards the champagne) and dinner is served to those who are hungry.But the real fun is downstairs. A cave-like basement (no windows, very little light, concrete floors) houses a low level stage that plays host to various local, up and coming music acts. There are a few booths for sitting, a bar (necessary), a dance floor area, and a little room in the middle that houses a dude with an ipod (a DJ? perhaps...) who fills the room with sound when the bands are finished. One of my favorite nights in London was spent here, when my friends and I took over the DJing role, plugging in my iphone, and played Neon Moon while teaching the assorted English doctors, poets and grad students how to dance- country style. We drank bottles of champers (not sure who paid the bill that night- probably a new friend), gallivanted around the dance floor like the rednecks the English blokes thought us to be, and left flush with memories and giggling. Tumbling into a cab, we began planning our feast at the flat (cheesy omelets, toast with Marmite, lots of water) and our next trip to the Troubadour- our favorite place to go on a random night when we need some fun without the usual drama/lines/expense of the London club scene or the high street bar intensity. I can't wait to go back :)",

We sat in the back courtyard, which was actually what gives this place 4 stars. I was about to try the Huevos Rancheros, but looking at others have it, it certainly wasn't presented very well. I mean, I've been DYING to have a great Huevos, since I've not really had them outside the US, but I don't think I was ready to try this mad looking concoction. Anyway, all in all, seemingly a great place to have a drink, food and coffee in the area,but I wouldn't travel across London to Earls Court for it. 4*s because of the ambience, 3 for the food.",

The food is also variable: my advice is to stick to their breakfasts, omelettes and burgers - which are both cheaper and better than trying more fancy Italian-inspired dishes. Their wine is expensive for what you get, too. In effect, you are much better off treating it as a coffee house for breakfast or lunch than as a restaurant for dinner. So why go at all? Well, there's no denying that it has atmosphere - if you are ever going to meet Left-Bank style intellectuals, it'll be here. On some nights, you could almost imagine Piaf walking through the door. When so many other venues are just tacky or lifeless chains, it really does deserve the term 'institution'. Just be prepared for slow service, and don't go if you are claustrophobic",

Firstly I've been here many times for Sunday breakfast - absolutely lovely. I recommend the omelettes and the fisherman's breakfast. Obviously a tad expensive but considering the area and the service, it's worth it. There is a lovely outside garden too.For dinner, I ordered the fish and chips - good quality pub food I would say! It's always crowded so service can be a bit slow at times. This is also one of the few pubs I'm comfortable ordering wine. Wine is pretty good and I believe it's probably cos of the associate wine shop next door.I've also been for a gig here (in the basement). I would say this was my only bad experience - really tiny space and way too many drunks. I was surprised to later find out that some of the drunks were part of the band performing (some Texan family band!) Considering many indie bands were discovered here, I may give it another chance.",

Only if I'm not in a rush or am just enjoying a drink.

    "text": "A friend suggested live music for Friday night entertainment and we ended up heading to The Troubadour. Our plan was simple: chat over a glass of wine and then head downstairs for some live music. However a few things didn't go as smoothly as we hoped:1. Finding a table. I walked in and was told that there's no table available currently. The waitress didn't tell me if I should wait inside or outside or don't even bother to wait, so I ended up standing awkwardly at one end of this crowded cafe waiting for someone else to rescue me. Luckily a table opened up shortly and I claimed it with lightning speed. 2. Slow service. We just wanted to get a glass of wine, but it took 15 minutes to get a menu. The large glass of red wine is indeed very large (I'm pretty sure I was more than tipsy when I finished it). I forgot what kind of wine we got because my French friend was in charge, and he told me it wasn't good. So I took his word for it. 3. The bands. I think we just went on a very unfortunate evening and the bands were not good. First there was a very cheesy English pop band that performed some nice song but the vocalist wasn't that good at singing. Then a French band came to perform dancy/clubby music (in English), and that was horrendous. The vocalist kept trying to get everyone to dance or clap their hands, and mumbled something like \"it's all about clubbing~\"... SO AWKWARD. We sat through 2 songs out of politeness and then fled... 4. The live music ticket was cash only.I would probably give this place a 2nd chance but I'd check the genre of the bands before coming (and bring cash!).",

You can pretty much find something in the Troubadour for any occasion at any time in the day... Breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks, club and live music!! Lots to choose from and a good experience at many of these times will bring you back for more. There is an excellent menu available all hours of the day, some good vegetarian options too and they always welcome mixing and matching. Whilst the upstairs restaurant does get busy on a weekend (and they do recommend booking) the staff, who are very welcoming and friendly, if a little scatty at times, will do their utmost to accommodate you, even if it is in the wine bar next door. The atmosphere is always warm and welcoming and the decor is full of music memorabilia, local area history and artefacts! Do not be afraid of getting cosy if it is busy but the hubbub will def add to your experience. If you are up for a night of live music and or music (?!) the downstairs club is worth a visit and you may well be lucky enough to catch a guitar legend on a rare occasion. The booze runs and the music plays and your evening will be enjoyed by all! Price wise, food is good for the price but not cheap. \u00a310-\u00a313 for a main but your plate will be piled high and well worth it. Drinks again vary in price depending what you want but I genuinely have a really nice time wherever I am in the building and I would recommend it to anyone.Xyz",

    "text": "So...if you gave this place a 3, I could get it.When my friends told me about a place for live music, I was interested. We grabbed a drink upstairs, no food, and it was definitely a bit quirky decoration wise. Beers were a little above average price but the vodka drinks were a good deal (though service hiked it up).The live music comes with a charge of \u00a310 per person. Not a terrible deal for live music BUT we heard one song and then they were done. Our entire group definitely felt a bit cheated...The place was packed for that one song (and presumably for the entire set). And gee it's hot down there.. There is a \u00a310 credit card minimum also. Unlike in the US where they keep a tab open for you (I just moved from there), the bartender told me to pay then for two beers, only take one beer, and come back later for the second beer. Slightly interesting.My friend was approached by a man who looked 70 years old and asked her for blow (seriously). But then we also met some guys more our age who were quite friendly.I'll be back. But next time I'll go earlier than 10:15 to ensure I get my \u00a310 worth of music. Maybe I'll even find out how to reserve a table downstairs!",
