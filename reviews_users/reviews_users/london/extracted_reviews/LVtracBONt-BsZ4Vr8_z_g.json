We checked the reviews on Yelp and decided to test this place : we were not disapointed at all. The food is really excellent (special mention to the poached duck egg on brioche) and comes quickly and the staff is really kind. You sit at the bar around the kitchen but it is not to noisy and it's cool to see all your food being cooked under your eyes. Contrary to some reviews, we went there at 8:30 p.m. and we didn't wait at all (I guess it was not a busy day). The place and the atmosphere are very nice and pleasant. We would definitely recommand this place and we'll certainly be back during our next stay to London.",

We had the salmon tartare, veal tongue, lamb kidney and lamb sweetbreads. If you've never had any kind of this stuff because it's just too weird - but are curious - the veal tongue would be a good starter. My girlfriend is the offal fan, I'm just along for the ride. I would dissuade those not used to organ meat from trying the lamb kidney, but the veal tongue is really good, even if you don't like that kind of thing. The only complaint I had was the street beggars while sitting outside. But I suppose you can't do much there. This will be a must visit for us.",

Look for the blackboard specials and order out of your comfort zone for the best experience. A warning, it gets crowded and its small. Waits can be upwards of an hour but it's totally worth it. Have a drink and talk to the people waiting next to you. I've met some awesome people just waiting to eat. Everyone talks to everyone, it's that kind of place.There are two locations. The Soho location is the original and the better of the two, but you can't go wrong with either.Enjoy!",

    "text": "This continuing from the review below because I ordered nearly the whole menu again...Crab bunOne who loves a moist burger like me will just fall in love this bun. It was incredible, a bit messy but worth scooping every last drop with your finger afterwards. The bun was so soft and airy it moulded into the shape of your fingers, topped with poppy seeds for that sweet peppery edge. Filled inside was a thick generous filling of crab in its rich sticky buttery bisque packed full of flavour and seasoning just right.Classic tortilla I did asked for the chorizo but they misheard and delivered the classic instead. As incredible as the texture was with its moist firm outside eggy layer breaking into a thick yolky filling of soften onions and potatoes, it somewhat lacked depth and flavour. It did call for a stronger ingredient in there to add some excitement to it and I believe chorizo would have been a fine pairing. I was impress by the skill to create such a delicate dish but mixed in with all the more flavoursome dishes I had beforehand I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be.Roast milk fed lamb Wasn't very happy with the cut we were given as the meat along the side of the rib was much more compact and dense making it more more dry and stringy as I had hope. However much to my preference was the crispy skin that had been grilled so nicely it in the josper grill that it had crisp in its fat making it incredibly moreish. The little thin layers of meat in between each bone was much more rewarding too being moist and tender but of course that itself is not worth the \u00a318.80 we paid for a little bit of skin and meatArroz con lecheSomething so simple like sweet chilled cinnamon in whole milk with rice was incredibly gratifying. Being quite thin and milky it was very light to enjoy, almost like a sweet soup and warming to the soul with the nutty spicy cinnamon.Cuajada This was another simple dish but also one that left me in awe. Similar to the texture of panna cotta but more natural being made of milk curd instead of gelatine and cream. It was incredibly creamy, subtle in flavour and gentle sweetened leaving room for the delicious thick chewy honeycomb to do the job. Being grainy, sticky and intense in its rich earthy sweetness, one little blob was enough to sweeten the whole dessert. Topped nicely with crunchy hazelnuts for that perfect contrast and nutty finish.There were a few dishes that really shone out in both quality and creativity in the kitchen however I didn't quite expect to enjoy it as less as I thought I would. I'm not sure if it was my taste preference or an off day. Don't get me wrong, the quality of the ingredients and cooking skills was definitely on par but I felt some dishes lacked depth or the combination of ingredients didn't quite match, overpowering some of the more delicate flavours. Their deep fried dishes are definitely their speciality though. Still I plan to visit another branch and see what the rest have to offer and what everyone is raving about",

The menu was carefully crafted to include everyone's Spanish favourites and is compelmented by an extensive \"specials\" board which are well worth a look. Is it expensive? Yes. But it's the best Spanish food you'll find in London and the food at Barrafina is well worth paying for.",

I was one of the first people in when they opened and grabbed a stool. It's only counter seating which a lot of the food prepared in front of you. The staff was very kind and informative. I ordered the Mediterranean prawns which were grilled while and excellent. The grilled leeks were good and in a vinegar sauce. The arroz negro was great. A large portion with a lot of squid. It had a large dollop of aioli which it didn't need. It was a tad too oily but very good. I recommend if you need a change of pace from British cuisine.",

It was pleasant enough, I had to wait half an hour to be seated but i was prepared for that! The staff were accommodating and squeezed me in round the kitchen bar area (no actual tables so you can watch the food being made). They had a large selection of tapas on the menu - not a great wine list however. Half of the specials board had sold out which was a shame, and it wasn't too late...only 9pm once I'd sat down. The food itself was delicious and very well presented, but I think my main complaint is that I left \u00a340+ lighter, feeling like I could sill eat!",

Everything was very tasty and unique. Then crispy duck, followed by a chicken and beef main dishes, and baby bok Choi. The paired desserts were equally fantastic. Glad our friends recommended that we try this place, it was great. Nice atmosphere downstairs, excellent service. We never felt rushed. Dropped a princely sum, but I'm sure we could have gotten a fantastic meal ordering a la carte. We just wanted the full experience. Enjoy!",

He recommended some dishes to us and we tried something from almost every category on the menu. The food is tapas style, so each dish is served when ready. Everything had tons of flavor, with my favorites being the tomato salad and the prawn and manchego tortilla. Honestly just order randomly off the menu and you can't go wrong. Our servor said the arroz negro was his absolute fav but we didn't like it as much. It's very seafood-y and messy to eat. Will turn your entire mouth black. The inside was crowded so we ate outside on the patio/terrace. Some dishes are pricier than others, like the ham, and overall it's on the pricier side but the quality of the food is there.",

The room is clean and lit well with white walls abound. I loved the fact that all the diners get to sit so close to the action. You can see all the cooks working at their various stations which is always a sight to see. While I am no expert when it comes to tapas, I found most of their dishes quite monotonous. We ordered quite a variety of dishes and found that they all had very similar flavors and textures. No dish really stood out except the soft shell crab with its play on an Asian classic that included soy and green onion. The \"tortilla\" was pushed hard to me by our server as one of their best dishes but I found it to be quite bland with its mushy potatoe filling and soft exterior. Other dishes we got included pork belly which lacked the melt-in-your-mouth texture we are used to and a fried tuna dish which tasted mostly like oil. The chicken croquetas were well executed and are worth getting.",

As we walked into the restaurant, there was a line with at least 5 parties ahead of us and we were told that there is no guarantee for a spot as people were not leaving. We prayed so hard as we waited and we were so very lucky to get a spot around 9:30pm. As all 4 of us sat down on the bar, we ordered so many dishes as if there was no tomorrow. The restaurant was closing and the last order was around 9:45pm. We ordered as many dishes as we could and every one of them were so tasty with wine. We were still eating while the staff was cleaning the stoves and ovens. Staff was all very friendly and attentive and they allowed us to order a dessert to finish off the dinner. We left the restaurant at around 11pm with an extremely happy and satisfactory stomach. It was so gooooooood!!",

With three top rated locations in London, Barrafina is an institution that prides itself on utilizing only the highest quality seasonal ingredients every day. The interior at this location in Covent Garden is elegant without being pretentious, with all seating situated in an L-shaped bar. The open kitchen allows you to watch the chefs work, and admire the displays of fresh vegetables and seafood that they work with. Great selection of Spanish wines, sherries, and Cavas. There are several vegan options on the menu, but be sure to ask your server about vegan specials, as they change daily. We started with wine and appetizers. I love that you can order as you go here, and try a variety of smaller plates. I got the Pan Con Tomate and the Padron peppers, both of which were expertly prepared traditional Spanish tapas. My favorite dish was one from the daily specials board-a Grilled Cabbage with Romesco sauce, made vegan without cheese. Roasted Marcona almonds, red peppers, tomato, and hazelnuts are blended to create a rich, earthy base for the tender cabbage. Do not skip dessert! We shared the Orange Sorbet, which was the best version of this dessert I have ever eaten. Served in a hollowed out orange, the freshly squeezed flavors were striking, packed with zest, and the perfect level of sweetness. The staff here are all lovely and very accommodating. I look forward to returning the next time I am in London.",

However, we ordered some small plates and drinks prior to seating.- Prices were very reasonable and the dishes were unique.- Favorite were the Black Squid Ink Rice, Uni Special and Cured Meats. Highly recommend all 3.- Seating is open kitchen bar seating. Definitely a cool experience and something needed more of in the US.- All of the dishes were good so I would recommend going out of your normal comfort zone here if you see something you like!- We ordered 10 tapas for 2 of us totaling approx $100 USD. I would recommend 3 per person. Overall, this would be the #1 restaurant I would come back to in London. Even though it's not traditional London cuisine, the execution by the chefs is phenomenal.",

    "text": "This Spanish restaurant is a MUST visit whenever I'm in London (given I have time to queue). And now that I've moved here for a one year Master's program, I've somehow moved into a place just a minutes walk from their Drury Lane branch. Coincidence much?My must order every time is the Chorizo Tortilla (\u00a39) with egg, chorizo, and potato slices. It's absolutely divine! Just seeing how the egg yolk seeps out as soon as you cut into it will put a smile to your face.As for the rest, I like their croquettes, jersey royals scrambled egg with iberico, pork belly, and their mussels/clams.The one disappointing dish would be their calamari which is fried perfectly but missing a dipping sauce.--voodie rating: 8.5/10--Per head \u00a330+",
