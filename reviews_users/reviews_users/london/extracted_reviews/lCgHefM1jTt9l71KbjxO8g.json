But they were sitting on one side of a table, and we were seated on the other, so it was really incredibly awkward. They have a few fried cheese, vegetarian options, but I just had chips and mushy peas, and my mom had the classic fish and chips. \u00a0She said it was good, light and crispy and good quality fish. We also ordered dessert- the toffee pudding... and it was really disappointing. Definitely not fresh, pretty dry and sad. Service was fine, if super inattentive (Insert diatribe: service stereotypes about English waiters being inattentive, aloof and sometimes rude are unfair- I find this to be true about LONDON service only. \u00a0Having a chance to travel outside of London a bit, I found service everywhere else to be very friendly and of high quality. Crappy service isn't excusable as a cultural idiosyncrasy, in my opinion.)Overall, it was fine, but I don't think it was worth the high prices. \u00a0The super central location is probably more the reason for the expense than the quality, as it seems like there are some other, very well reviewed, classic places that are a bit more affordable.",

    "text": "I was lucky enough to visit Jolly ol' London during Christmas week of 2011. I took in the sights, and felt my London bid would be incomplete If I didn't try fish and chips. Not knowing jack about London went on Yelp to rely on some good references. I first went to North Sea Seafood Restaurant which was closer to my hotel, but It was closed both days I attempted to go there - which I was kinda pissed. Enter Yelp again and found Rock and Sole Plaice to be my go-to. When I rolled up the table seating outside was jammed, but there was no line to go inside. I walked in and was immediately seated to the only empty table. MENUI peeked at the menu and they had different fish to fry up. I just decided to go traditionally with cod. EATING OPINION10 minutes after ordering my plate comes out heaping with chips and a huge piece of cod. The batter is crispy. Could not taste any beer in the batter. The cod itself when you cut into it is about 1 inch thick. Its soft and fluffy, not rubbery. The chips are crispy, but looked familiar to what we call in the USA - steak fries. There was no skin on the fries so I think these were just a bag of frozen steak fries flash fried. The best part was the tartar sauce on the table. Open the metal lid to reveal this white saucy goodness with seemingly fresh dill. The dill is not strong, but very evident. This tartar sauce really enhances the fish. \u00a0Washed it all down with a can of Coke. And yes, the Coke formula in the UK tastes different than the USA. In the end I struggled, but did manage to finish the entire plate cause it was alot of food....but also alot of grease. PRICE/OBSERVATIONSWhile the dish was plentiful it did cost 13.50 pounds for the plate. In comparison, the next day had another random fish and chips run which cost 7.50 for fish and chips. While R&S is very expensive, the serving portion is only slightly larger. I ate at O'Neills Irish Pub with real Irish food. O'Neills is not a fish and chips place, but a pub, so advantage R&S naturally. The fish execution was better at R&S.OVERALLIn all, the dish of fish and chips is a traditional English staple. To me the attraction to most is the simplicity of it. To me, the drawback is the simplicity of it. I like to compare it to chicken tenders or chicken cutlets. While good, I've never eaten a chicken cutlet (batter fried chicken breast strips), or in this case batter fried cod that knocked my socks off. Just good, but not absolute can't miss. Still with that, if I ever came back, I'd try the other fish selections at R&S. I'd recommend R&S for people to try fish and chips, but at 13.50 pounds.",

However, there are some pretty awesome murals of undersea creatures to keep you company.At first glance, the prices kind of knocked us back, especially with the overall feel of the place screaming middle of the road; but our waiter, sensing our trepidation, did a very good job of instilling confidence in us. \u00a0When our plates came, it was a giant fillet of absolutely delectable perfectly cooked Cod, crispy and tasty but not oily batter, and large wedge handcut chips that oozed buttery potato on every bite, slopped in homemade ketchup and tartar. \u00a0We changed our minds about the value--worth it--, but our waiter was not done trying to make sure we left satisfied, and threw in some sponge cake desserts that complimented the meal perfectly. \u00a0Can't say this is standard operating procedure, but rest assured we rolled out of there proclaiming this little chippie the Central London Master.",

The trusty Yelp app recommended Rock & Sole and after shopping in Covent Garden off we went.The location is convenient, and the menu easy. We arrived just before peak lunch and were able to find a cozy spot to sit. The small space of no more than a dozen seats was quickly flooded with take-away patrons and those that were dining in squeezed into every seat, including the extra at our table. For if the space had been larger, I would not have been treated to learning the customer sitting next to me was having a falling out with her flatmate. Entertainment +1 The biggest dissapointment was what seems to be a pattern. When asking for Haddock, we were informed only Cod was available fresh. We asked again for the Haddock , willing to wait, and were fairly pushed into choosing the Cod as it was \"just fried\". We opted to go with the Cod save for waiting an indeterminate amount of time. Unfortunately we waited 15 minutes anyway for that fresh cod. Thankfully the portions are large and filling and as good as I remember it.",

The haddock was good, and the batter was just nice -- neither too thick nor too thin. It could have been a little softer though. The chips were lightly salted and came in varying sizes; they were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside -- great!* Freshness/Cleanliness: B+. The haddock tasted fresh, but it could have been previously frozen. No complaints otherwise.[SERVICE]* Friendliness: B+.* Time to Order: A. Considering that I visited duing lunch time (1pm) and they were out of large haddock when I placed my order, I only had to wait two or three minutes before my order was ready. Quite speedy![VALUE]* Portion Size: A. Huge portions; coupled with chips, a large fish would be too much for one person. Better for sharing.* Prices: C. The outstanding reputation of this store might have inflated its prices somewhat, but they are still too high, even when the good quality of the fish and chips is taken into consideration. A large order of fish and chips cost \u00a311, while dine-in costs \u00a314. To make matters worse, no mayonnaise or tartar sauce is provided for takeout orders -- how can one eat fish and chips without that?{Scoring Guide: A - Outstanding; B - Average; C - Below Average; D - Terrible}",

I get the cod and it is delicious and perfectly fried. However, the chips are just okay and sometimes you get a few stale ones. Make sure you ask for salt, vinegar, and tartar sauce (& sometimes they charge you for tartar sauce). It is a little over-priced but the portions are very large so you won't be hungry after a meal here. There are better places to eat in London but if you are looking for traditional fish & chips or a quick and simple meal, this is the place to come!",

    "text": "Full disclosure: I'm a tourist from the United States.Dinner was a disappointment, given what I'd read from other reviewers.The chips were average at best. The fish was pretty decent, juicy inside and crispy outside, but nothing to write home about. On quality of the food alone, I'd give them 3/5 stars.But what brings them down to 2/5 stars is the value. A large, single fillet of cod, a couple handfuls of chips, and a beer was 22 pounds. It wouldn't have been worth 22 dollars, let alone the exchange rate. Yesterday I stumbled across a different Fish & Chips restaurant near the river and paid about 15-18 pounds (can't remember exactly because the price was reasonable enough so as to be forgettable) for the same amount of fish and chips and beer, and yet it came with a side of peas, to boot.All in all, not the best way I've spent my money this trip. It probably didn't help that the waitress shorted me a pound when she brought me the change for my tab.",

    "text": "I ordered the Cod & Chips with salt and vinegar to go. I highly recommend getting the vinegar on your portion. If vinegar has an absolute purpose, then it may be being generously applied to Rock & Sole Plaice's Cod & Chips. The Cod crust was perfectly crisp. The fish itself was fresh which you can tell by the taste and the gray skin (If wrong, I've absolutely failed to learn anything as a native Islander). From now on, the fish and chips here are the standard to which I compare all other future fish and chips to.As you can tell, I was absolutely impressed by the food; however, the price was another story. A regular portion to take-away was 10, and to sit in cost over 50% more, so I decided to take-away and find a cozy spot in Covent Garden to munch in. The food may have been worthy of five stars, but the price to dine-in and the accommodations restrain Rock & Sole.To summarize, great takeaway spot. If you want a proper Fish & Chips experience in which you sit down at a cozy, low-arching pub and grab a pint of a cask ale, then I recommend the Windsor Castle in Notting Hill.",

We both ordered the the regular cod. The fish was fine, but greasy and the chips were hot, but very hard (had to pick through them to find edible pieces). Seemed to be old chips that had been sitting under a heating lamp for too long. In any case, very disappointing.

    "text": "Every tourist visiting London wants to try Fish and Chips, the most famous-- but not national--dish of the U.K. Unfortunately many of these tourists will end up settling for a substandard frozen then refried, saltless, tasteless rendition of this dish, at the chain of Taylor Walker pubs dotted throughout the tourist-heavy areas of London. This was the mistake I made in my first day here, and came away unsurprised, believing the myth of British food being mediocre to be true.Then I discovered The Rock and Plaice. Tucked away in the popular Covent Garden area, Rock and Plaice is easily accessible by train. The outdoor seating area is prime, if you're lucky enough to have the notorious London weather cooperating. Inside, the restraunt has a homey vibe; an open kitchen greets you with the warm smell of frying fish and chips (fries for my fellow Americans). The basement has additional seating and a somehow well-placed Jamaican vibe. Now to the food. I ordered the standard fried cod and chips. Fried layer on the fish was excellent, as if it had been hand breaded and dongle fried. The tartar was essential for giving the fish extra flavor and the chips were crisped to perfection. I feel the British have a predilection for sugar over salt, and I felt both items could have used a bit more sodium chloride, but none the less if you're from out of town and proper fish and chips, this plaice is rock solid.",

This corner shop reminds me of Guy Fieri and his show DDD...the fish was big and the chips were plenty. I liked what I saw on the menu - a variety of fish, not just the ol' boring cod. I ordered halibut. The batter was crispy and light, and the fish was nice and meaty. Their homemade tartar sauce was tasty, I used all of it and wanted more. Sure you're not going to get excellent service from this place, but that was okay with me because I didn't expect much. It was a wonderful fish & chip experience I had in London.",

It is very pretty for a fish and chip shop, the outside covered in a mural (you can get a free postcard of it too!) and hanging baskets of climbing plants. Coloured lights hang outside it over picnic tables, and it's nice to sit outside because there isn't too much traffic in Endell Street, especially in the evenings. The beautiful smell of vinegar over chips lures you inside. The food is very traditional - battered fish (and please don't eat cod, it is nearly extinct!), pickled onions, sausages, and big, fat, perfectly cooked chips in paper. I lived round the corner as a child and I used to stare at the bright white hair and eyebrows of the men of the family who run it while I waited on tiptoe for my chips. Oh, and they have nice wooden chip forks.",

The service used to be fab, they communicated if there was going to be a wait and the food was always awesome... What Happened? We visited here last night and after a truly crappy service didn't even end up eating. So what happened ? We we were on our way to see the Editors in Brixton. We thought the perfect way to prepare ourselves for lots of Brixton lager was to fill our bellies with delicious fish or sausage and batter and chips ( I don't eat fish...). so we rocked up ..decided to eat in and waited ... and waited ..we were then served , one rock and chips and 2 sausage in batter and chips with extra beans ..mmmmmmmmmm yums! \u00a0The place was in a certain degree of chaos which should have been a warning sign. so anyways .. we waited ...... and waited ... the queue of take away was been served immediately ...they were getting there food straight away and wandering off to enjoy .... we were left ... the take away purchasers kept coming and walking away with their hands full. By this time it was getting late .. we were close to missing the editors if we had to wait much longer. I politely asked the waitress ( not a smile in sight) how much longer it might be as we had already let them know when we sat down that we needed to be somewhere and were assured that it would be a quick service. She responded with 'its coming now' ..so we waited ...and waited a bit longer ....still the take aways being handed out .... other people in the cafe being served ..not us ... so I asked again ...only to hear her declare to the kitchen people that table 1 was complaining .. i wasn't even complaining .. just asking as she had told me it was coming now 10 minutes ago .... so a place of cod and chips was put in front of me ...hmmm i'm sorry ,i think this is not for us .. we ordered one rock and chips and 2 sausage and chips .. so the guy huffed and took it away ..coming back to let us know that the Rock was taking a bit longer as was fresh ... he said he could bring the sausage over anyway ..lovely we thought ..starving by this point and rather late! ....So he reappeared with one sausage in batter and chips with a bit of very greasy battered fish dumped on the top ...' you can have the fish for free as you have been waiting so long he declared' .... Im sorry but as someone who doesn't like fish, someone who was hungry and fed up with the way that we had been treated so far ..that did it. 'im sorry' i replied, 'but I dont eat fish' he went ahead and removed the fish from my plate with his fingers ...touching my chips in process ..leaving a lovely pool of grease on the plate and put it back in the cabinate ... that did it .. we needed to remove ourselves from the situation so left.Now there are a couple of things to say ... if this was a chippy that was selling fish and chips for \u00a05 quid, i probably would have let it go ... but these guys charge 10 to eat in ... in my book that is an expensive fish and chips and expect some sort of service, even if its just to be notified when i order that Rock takes longer to cook .. not to be told when I sit down that they would be able to do our order quickly.\\I will never go back here. Neither will the people I was with. Really disappointed as they used to be so good and I was so looking forward to some scrummy sausage in batter and chips ....",

In fact, 'Meh' implies a certain level of indifference in my book and I feel almost more strongly that the fish and chips here were Bleeeaaarrrgh. That's a very scientific bit of terminology by the way. Why? First off, the fish and chips were \u00a310 at minimum with table seating, twice as much as takeaway. That seems wholly overpriced for what is essentially a huge plate of greasy breaded randomness. I wasn't really that hungry so I got the fish cake for \u00a34.50 and it resembled a dry deep-fried hockey puck. Chips were soft and kind of mealy rather than crispy and flavorful. The outside seating is nice but the inside just doesn't seem that clean. Now I fully admit that I didn't try the fish and maybe it's so orgasmic that it overrides all the other negatives. But there is so much better food in general and in the vicinity, that you can get for half the price. And in terms of my fish and chips experience, even a posh place like Canteen has fish and chips for about the same price if not cheaper and they do a really good crunchy breadcrumb shell rather than an oily battered crust. I realize this may be fish-and-chips blasphemy, but it seems like an overpriced tourist trap without the chops (chips?) to back it up.",

Rock and Sole Plaice, on Endell Street is one of the best places for Fish and Chips. Their fish is fresh and tasty, and their chips are generous in size and portion. On a friday afternoon, the queue will spill out onto the street. I would advise getting a take away though. There are three seating areas: on the ground floor, in the basement, and on the street. On the street is fine if it's a lovely day, and you don't mind the fumes from the Endell Street car traffic (which seems to be getting busier by the day), but the only place I wouldn't recommend is sitting downstairs. It's very close to the hygiene facilities and occasionally the smell can be overpowering to the point of distraction. If fish isn't the way you roll, they also serve chicken, battered sausage and a variety of other chippie-related foods. It's all a bit heart-stoppingly cholesterol driven, but you really REALLY should treat yourself. This is a chippie at it's best, and is always hit, never miss, and they've managed to keep the quality up.",

Even though most people like to sit outside during the summer months, I only recently found out they have a much larger dining room downstairs, perfect for when it's drizzling outside. At the end of the day, it is just a fish and chip store, though what it does, it does really well.",

It's a bit more down to earth (and therefore cheaper) that the restaurants actually around Covent Garden piazza and is a brilliant example of British cuisine at its best! I used to work round the corner from here and it was all too easy to drop in after a bad day at the office for something yummy to cheer myself up. The delicious smells draw you in as you walk past and it's hard to resist. I like it best in summer when you can sit outside under the fairy lights in the evening and enjoy your fish and chips in the open air. However, there's a dining room downstairs (that I only discovered was there after I'd been to The Rock & Sole Plaice half-a-dozen times) which means you can eat comfortably in the winter or if it's raining. You do come away with your clothes smelling of frying though, so don't wear anything that'll need dry cleaning! Really fresh fish in crispy batter with golden chips - nothing can beat it - and this is just the place to come and find it.",

It took a while for our food to come out, but at least it was good. The chips were tasty as well. I wouldn't recommend dining outside though, those damn pigeons were all over the place- we were outside at first, but one of the birds pooped on a friend's menu, so we took it indoors. The prices were decent, the beer was cold and the staff was competent. I would definitely recommend Rock & Sole for an authentic fish and chips experience if you're ever in the neighborhood- and there's great shopping in the area as well.",

The fish here is cooked superbly, with a large range of varieties of fish always being sold, along with other chip-shop food.

The GF finally made it to the UK and wanted to try a \u00a0proper fish and chips. Being that we were in Covet Gardens this place shined as the place to go for fish and chips in the area. I mean this place has been around for over a 100 years so it must be good right?!? That's what I thought... Having a recently found fancy for haddock I ordered a large haddock and chips and beef and onion pie for us to share.The fish and chips was served at room temperature like it had been sitting out for a while or they gave us someones take away order... You could tell because the meat was already dry and the chips were soggy and clammy. I wanted to send the order back but the waitress was nowhere to be found and by the time I would've got a hold of her it would've been worse. After breaking into the fish I noticed the skin was left on. I don't know if this is a sign of laziness or how it is traditionally served since the other 2 places ( The Pheasant and Kerbisher & Malt) that I have fish and chips earlier in the trip had the skin removed. The obviously takes away from being able to enjoy a complete through and through crunch of the fish because you have to cut and slide the fish off the skin. I know it seems trivial but it really does kill the texture of the dish. As I mentioned previously the chips were rubbish. They were cold, clammy and barely edible. I don't know if the staff thought they could pile crap on our plate because we were tourists or they were lazy and served us leftovers. The beef and onion pie was very underwhelming and like the fish and ships was served at room temp and not piping hot. The fries that accompanied the pie suffered the same problem that the other dish did. Cold and clammy chips... What a fail....  If this is how they do business how have they managed to stay in business for so long? Needless to say I would not recommend this to be your place to blow your load on fish and chips on your London trip. Like most people, these 2 dishes were on my must eat list while in London and like everyone else on holiday we must make the most out of where we eat. So getting a bust of a joint like this place ruins your holiday experience.  Tourist tip:Take the underground to Hammersmith and go to Kerbisher & Malt. The locals say its a posh joint but costs just as much as a tourist trap like this place. You wont be disappointed. I like to end on a positive note so here it is: They gave us a free postcard for our travels.",

    "text": "I am really shocked by this place and honestly maybe the five star reviews is because I never really liked Fish & Chips, or I've only had terrible Fish & Chips, either way this place was mind-blowingly good. I had this spot on my radar for London frankly because it was probably one of the most reviewed places. I was definitely skeptical, as I mentioned above, as I am not the biggest fried foods fan, and I was afraid that it was going to be way too touristy or just kind of a sell out. I also do remember fish and chips from freezers long ago as well as ... places here in the US claiming to have \"fish & chips.\" We got in line to order, and actually it wasn't too busy, and we got to sit inside on this slightly overcast day. The service was pleasant, and the food came quickly. MY GOODNESS. Was it fresh. Wow! I have never had such a deliciously tender and flavorful fried fish. It was juicy, moist, everything I didn't think fish could be, especially when cooked. The batter was not heavy, greasy or in anyway intrusive to the flavor. It actually added a nice texture to the fish. Plus, the chunk that we received was huge, it was like half of the plate! I was really surprised, shocked, both pleasantly, by this place and I have to say that it really has been the best Fish & Chips I have **ever** had and I would not hesitate to recommend it or to go back again.

So we trekked to Rock and Sole Plaice (play on words w. some delicious white fish). They have outdoor seating which must be nice when it's not raining (wait, when does it NOT rain?!), they have indoor seating at street level and apparently they have more seating downstairs which you go outside to go down (we did not see this part so have no idea what it looks like).If you're doing takeout you'll pay less. If you're staying, you'll pay more and no this apparently does not include tip (did not know this. so sorry...we're not cheap bast*ds...really!).Service is so-so and im giving it 4 stars for the fish. \u00a0Really awesome fish. \u00a0Lightly battered, fried crisp and the fish itself is moist, fresh and DELICIOUS. \u00a0The chips were eh. We're not fan of fat fries...But they were fresh potato and you could taste it.Where we sat we were surrounded by musical and theatre flyers and behind those is white tile quite reminiscent of a bath...Otherwise we were quite happy sitting down even if it was a little cramped.Great suggestion by one of our friends, it was worth wandering the streets starving just to find it :)",

    "text": "What's more convenient fun than spending time with Yelp friends exploring their city on holiday? The answer is spending time with visiting Yelp friends exploring your own city!My good Yelp friend Lorrie M contacted me a few months ago when she was planning a trip to London and we arranged to hang out when she was in town. It's always fascinating to see your own city through the eyes of someone from outside, who may perhaps have different insights from your own jaded local's viewpoint.In amongst Lorrie's challenging 3 day schedule to see virtually all the big sights and many Yelp recommended local experiences was to have good ol' British fish and chipsRock & Sole Plaice is in fact about 15 steps from one of my regular gelato haunts, Scoop in Covent Garden but I've never been aware that this was here and therefore never considered eating here for lunch. Branded a tourist haunt by locals and therefore probably avoided for that reason, I was intrigued to find that this restaurant actually has a long history going back to 1871, being the 3rd chippy ever in London, long before mass tourism became popularWe managed to snag a table to ourselves indoors though I can see that you might have to share tables at busy times. Prices reflect its prime Covent Garden location though I think portions are generous - our normal sized fillets of fish were plenty for usOur deep fried cod and rock were covered in a wonderfully crispy batter, which broke open to reveal moist, flaky fish. They have definitely got the fish frying down to a tee after 141 years! Who cares if this is a tourist haunt if they can cook this quintessential British dish like this?The chips were traditional chippy chips - broad with crusty edges and floury insides and best eaten warm while they're still crisp. The only disappointment was the mushy peas which tasted unpleasantly chalky for some reason and could have done with some sweetnessThanks for Lorrie M for introducing me to a delight in my own city and so close to Scoop, where we popped into for some dessert!",

The first thing that I noticed was that prices are pretty high, so I opted for the sausage and chips, while my friends decided to split a plate of the fish and chips. To be fair, they more than got their money's worth!The food was great, served hot and served quickly. We tucked in outside opposite a group of Londoners (frequented by the locals, always a good sign!), and generally found ourselves at the end of the night fat and happy, with our purses a few pounds lighter (get it?). Notably, the restaurant was packed (though that is understandable given that it was a Friday night), and seating was a bit hard to find. You'll have to be prepared to share a table or bench if you choose to sit outside, but it's nice to socialize with new folks, right?!I'd love to go back and try the fish and chips myself, though I had a few bites from my friends' plate. I admire the wide selection of fish available, and was pleased to finally understand the meaning of 'rock and sole plaice'. Given that it was the only exposure I had to fish and chips, I can't speak as to the comparative quality of R&SP compared with others around (and even if I had, I wouldn't consider myself qualified--any deep fried food seems to break even in my mind and to my tastebuds). I would wager though, that it's a damn good place, given that I'd go back again and I'm not even the biggest fan of seafood. I'd say in sum then, that if you only have one place to grab your fish and chips in London, the Rock and Sole Plaice is as good a choice as any.",

So I dream of eating at Rock and Sole Plaice.This place has been here as long as I can remember, the fish is always great, the food comes out piping hot and the chips are exactly how I love them to be. I walk into this place and the warm, stuffy smell of fish and chips rocks my soul! Don't be fooled. The gravy and chicken nuggets are amazing too if you don't fancy fish.The last time we were there, the cook wasn't happy with how our fish was cooked and gave it to us for free! (We're not gourmet chefs but it tasted great to us!) Either way, this kind of service tops off the whole experience..I'll be back as soon as I can!",

    "text": "So the prices do seem intense(ly high) for what you might want to dish out for your fish. Certainly the prime-touristique location dictates a bit of this, but I will say you won't be complaining about the quality of the great British staple Rock & Sole serves you up.As ironic as \"battered to perfection\" sounds - the fish is deliciously fried to a crispy golden exterior whist remaining light and falkey inside. And the SIZE of the chips- my gosh I didn't know we harvested potatoes this enormous to create such gigantic starchy chunks (genetically modified farming considered). So really unless you're on the brink of starvation I'd say sharing a large portion between 2, or 2 between 3 and so on will get you a better \"moneys worth\" making this not such an extortionate gastronomic splurge.Sit down on the pleasant picnic benches outside and you won't believe you're parallel to one of London's busiest shopping stretches. Or, what better than a steaming hot bundle of vinegary greased up carbs on the go to keep your fingers (and stomach of course) warm wandering around bustling Covent Garden.",

I was very glad to stumble on this place through a yelp search. 4stars. Conviently located in the trendy covent garden. Done! \u00a0Unfortunately, the trip was a major miss. I had the \u00a315 regular cod dine in option and a british beer. The cod was very stale, oily, and tasteless. The chips were even worse. Cold and dense with oil. I am very sure you can do much better elsewhere. I noticed one reviewer speculated that ownership has changed. Perhaps that's it. At any rate, I would seek other options.Two stars mainly for the location and fairly friendly staff.",

The fish was extremely bland. If you can drench the fish in tartar sauce and ketchup, you will be able to tolerate it. The chips were probably cooked last week. \u00a0And not to mention how EXPENSIVE it was. It was \u00a315 (GBP) which is $22.86 in American Dollars ($). That was for the regular size and did not include a drink that was an additional \u00a32-4. This meal wasn't worth more than $8 (\u00a35) TOTAL. If you wanted the same meal and decided to eat somewhere else, it was literally \u00a35 cheaper (that's $8 freaking dollars!!). I was expecting this food to taste like HEAVEN in my mouth. Wrong! The service left much to be desired. Overall...not worth a visit unless you just happen to be walking by, all of the stores/restaurants near are closed and you just HAVE to eat here and spend all of that money! Never again!",

A hole in the wall joint with a few tables outside, a few on the first floor by the kitchen, and then more seating in the dungeon like, underground water themed room - so you can easily conjure up images of where the meal you are enjoying came from. Especially awesome is the mural of sharks eating each other. Same species cannibalism with dinner? Yes. Please. But really, once I got over the fact that they actually batter and fry the fish up with the skin still on it. I ate that shit up like I was in an eating contest. The fries were french, the fish was fried, and the tartar sauce was the perfect combination of dill and sauce. It was exactly like you would picture the loss of your London fish and chips virginity - it's a weird location, but after said and done, you have no regrets. Cheers!",

It was not very busy, so they could have been more attentive. Staff only asked if I wanted vinegar on the fish.Thinking we had lemon and tartar sauce, we walked away. About two blocks later, my friend and I check our boxes to find that we weren't given any of the usual accompaniments to fish and chips. She walked back to get them.The fish was fried well and still moist, but it lacked seasoning. So disappointing. Most of the chips were soggy and they also needed some more salt. Sure we were take-away customers paying less, but I think the staff should ensure that we enjoy our food as well.",

But because we have no place to go eat and it was raining so we had to eat in the little place. There were only 5 tables inside the place (they do have outdoor seating, I would totally sit outside and people watch if it wasn't raining).Water is not free; so you might as well order a beer or soda.I ordered the Cod (regular) for \u00a315. when the dish came out, oh my the Cod was HUGE! i can't imagine how big it would have been if it was a large order. The Fish was meaty & flaky and the batter was not heavy. The chips were alright, then again you're talking to someone who prefers skinny / thin fries.

Liked the batter, liked the chips, liked the sauce, was not super impressed by the cod. It's a little bit too fishy for my taste, and a little less flaky than ideal.

As a northern girl I know a good fish and chip shop when I see one. The only place I have found so far in London is the amazing Rock and Sole Plaice of Covent Garden.Yes the prices are London a little OTT and that's what I've come to expect in this city but at this little gem I will grin and bare the cost as the fish and chips here are out of this world! Everything from the interior of the chippy, to the service, to the gorgeous fish and proper chips is fantastic. I love that it's stayed traditional and you don't get the thin, French fries style chips as in most of London's take-away places. They have a huge range of different fish to select from and my mouth is watering now just thinking about them! I love this chip shop-it's the best I've ever been to (in London anyway!)",

It a couple of streets away from the main Covent Garden / Neal Street drag and so feels a lot more relaxed. The restaurant itself is positioned on the corner of a crossroads with outside seating and two floors of seating inside. The fish bar is on the ground floor by the entrance (though if you're eating in there is waiter service). It's best to go when it is sunny and sit outside, though failing that the downstairs has a general undersea theme which is charming in that slightly rubbish way. I've grown up in the south, not by the sea, which somewhat disqualifies me from judging these things, but I've never been particularly impressed by the food at this place. Everything is as it should be in terms of format and appearance, unfortunately the food is pretty London chip shop generic. This would be fine but the prices and general feel of the place promise something better. A pleasant enough place, convenient located if you're a tourist interested in trying fish and chips, though unfortunately the actual food is fairly average.",

You can have some beer, food, and fresh air, sun set.. hah haa, well it is still in Covent Garden!Also at this area it is hard to find any place that authentic as it is all so touristic. This place is hidden to a more quiet street, well at least away from the shops. The only downside is the restaurant itself. I would not call it charming. With a little decoration they could do major improves and I don't understand how come they don't seem to care? Until that happens I will just keep sitting outside.",

She literally had to bring out 2 other people before we were understood. \u00a0Though they acknowledged that they did not speak English well, they knew enough to tell us to leave before we were finished eating!",

With a 4 star rating it didn't seem like a gamble and I wasn't disappointed.I ordered the Sole and it was by far the best Fish & Chips I have ever had. The piece of fish was huge (I ordered the regular, I can't imagine how big the large would have been) and tasted wonderful. They didn't go over board with the batter, which is always a good thing, and the chips were thick-cut and tasty.I'd recommend this place (or plaice) in a heartbeat, especially to visitors looking for their first fish & chip experience. The only problem is they probably won't enjoy fish & chips anywhere else after they've eaten here.",

However, hunger took hold and in I went. I went for the recommended Cod, just a regular, and some mushy peas to make it at least a little bit healthy. The fish is very tender and moist, the fries are ok, nothing special, and the peas are mushy peas. They do add some nice color to the dish and \u00a0a bit of flavor when eating everything together.My bill with a bottle of water came to \u00a317.50, but 1) the company is paying 2) I didn't have to eat again that day 3) It was a vacation day 4) You're in Covent Garden.I'd come back. One let down is that there doesn't seem to be a single \"real\" Brit to be found, but what can you do? If you want Fish & Chips made by an authentic Brit these days, you have to travel outside London.",

I beg to argue. \u00a0Literally I can only give it a passable rating... for the price (\u00a310 for reg fish and chips) I was expecting something more as I've had some pretty amazing fish and chips for around that price (and in London albeit outside Central London).I was under-impressed with the wait staff as well as the fish, asked me to take a seat once I got the front of line and said I'd eat in and then proceeded to take orders from the 10 people who were in line after me before coming to to my table to take my order (couldn't I have just ordered in line)? Dropped of my f&c when it was ready and dropped was really the appropriate word there and forgot my drink until halfway through my meal. \u00a0I know this is a small mom and pop style place so I wasn't expecting great service, but I've had better at smaller f&c places so wasn't even up to par with them.Fish was just okay: batter was far from anything special, fish didn't taste particularly moist or fresh and the chips were soggy. \u00a0I'm not trying to be a Debbie Downer here, clearly many of you love this place so maybe it was just an off day, but there are just too many f&c places to explore in this town for me to ever venture here again unless I hear of some massive change in what they currently offer.I think it's suppose to be a very old fish&chips place (although doesn't look any older than it's 1980's decor) so I guess maybe that's the biggest appeal here?",

Ambiance - there are outdoor and indoor seatings. Depending on the season, one or the other may be more preferred. We went there during the summer, so we had outdoor seatings. The ambiance is quite nice. A good place for a date. Dress code here is casual. I rather have my own table though. We were arranged to sit with strangers. I guess they wanted to maximize their seatings, but the tables weren't full at the hour we were there. A little awkward. 4.

    "text": "I very much enjoyed the fish and chips here. It's not cheap but the service was quick and friendly and the food was good. We shared one plate of fish and chips because the portions are huge. Their fish is apparently locally sourced and sustainable, so you can feel a little better about eating here. It's worth nothing that if you choose to eat in the restaurant versus takeaway, you'll pay more for your meal. I for one welcome the chance to sit down after a long day of sightseeing and it's worth the extra money, but if you are on a budget please beware. You can choose the type of fish that you want, from cod to haddock to sole. The menu is obviously fish-heavy but they do have chicken nuggets for kids. Speaking of kids, if you have any in tow they will want to check out the menu (and inevitably laugh at the \"spotted dick\" on offer). I like that there's outdoor dining year round (we were wearing our winter coats and munching on crispy fried fish and chips al fresco). Throw in a couple of good beers and you've got yourself a nice evening in London.",

And if you're in London, you have to eat fish and chips, right? The whole restaurant has a maritime decor, with walls featuring large photos of boats and the sea - a really great backdrop for photos! I ordered a London Pride and the plaice and chips. First of all, the portions are huge!! Better to split a starter and a main between two people. I really loved the fish but the fries were awful. But I don't think it's specific to this location, because British \"chips\" just seem to be very big and not crisp. I think it's just a cultural preference, because I live in Belgium, home of the best fries!Would definitely recommend this location to anyone visiting London wanting authentic British food!",

It might be a little too hefty for fish and chips, but as a tourist, I don't really mind paying a little extra.A friend of mine brought me here, they have good outdoor dining and some decent seats downstairs. I arrived here at 11am and by 12 noon it was packed! I suggest arriving a little early.Now food, food, I really don't expect much from English food, a lot of Asians (like me) say it's really boring since it's all fried food, potatoes and pies. For me this was actually outstanding because despite the lack of \"seasoning\" you'd get from Asia, British people are very particular with the method of cooking and the simple quality of its ingredients--very European. Rock and sole has choices for different kinds of fish for their fish and chips. We tried halibut and cod, and both were amazing. They serve it with the usual tartar sauce but they also have malt vinegar and salt on the table. I urge you to experiment and use the malt vinegar and salt and all the condiments on the table, it'll make your experience here worthwhile.",

Tourist Tips:1. \u00a0There is a sit down price (10 pounds for the small) and a take away price (7 pounds for the small).2. \u00a0If you see that the place is packed, don't be discouraged there is additional seating downstairs3. \u00a0The place does accept credit cards but requires a minimum charge of 5 pounds.4. \u00a0If you order a coke, they will bring a glass with no ice.",

The fish was deliciously flaky with a yummy, crispy batter.

    "text": "London has everything. Well, almost, minus a lot of familiar American labels. However, the benefits of going to a country which speaks English (I'll go into British-speak and its differences a little later), are that it's relatively easy to get around, even if you are a chronic directionally-challenged tourist, and the convenience of already being assimilated into a Westernized country. There are a billion cultural differences, and I will attempt to give a glimpse into what I see via words.Today marks the three weeks that I have been here, but I believe that I have hit both the local and the touristy scenes. Because of my internship, I have \"assimilated\" into being a Brit, somewhat. My supervisor is from Liverpool, and most likely the funniest girl I have met in my life. She is so full of life (increased by her heavy accent), and ready to embark on the world. The other young interns have given me fantastic advice about where to find great nightlife, and mostly, a rounded perspective on Brit vs California life. Hence, many conversations over door-to-door campaigning (in other words, freezing our asses off and walking up and down three blocks), pizza, exploring food on Sheen Lane, and moving offices.ANYWAY, to start off, FOOD. All sorts of restaurants and small eateries in the last few weeks, I can FEEL the dire need to hit the gym soon, before my Asian-girl metabolism cannot handle it anymore.Apparently, tonight I went to one of the best fish and chips restaurants in London, Rock and Sole Pliace, located in Covent Gardens off of Endell Street. This hole in the wall restaurant did have delicious fish and chips (but I still think nothing could compare to Old Street Kebab). Lucky for MD and me, we shared a large cod and chips (11GBP), and they gave us two fairly large fish (yay!). It filled us up right quick, and I'm ALWAYS down for anything fried! There was tartar sauce and ketchup in pots to your own liking on the table, with vinegar too, which was probably the most amazing thing ever because I absolutely love tartar sauce (as awful as it is for you!). The fish was crispy and succulent in exactly the right place, but not too greasy. Fries were chewy, and steak-cut. Not my most FAVORITE chips, and just lukewarm though.The interior design of the restaurant was quirky-- upstairs was a typical take-out area with a few seating areas, but walking down, you sort of descend into an underwater aquarium.Malt vinegar came in a box, LOVED that when I found it.",

But, it doesn't have many seats.I try to eat healthy, so i try don't to have to many fried things But, if your going to have a fish and chips this is a good go to place.",

    "text": "After hearing that Rock & Sole Plaice was one of the oldest and best fish & chips places in London, a group of us decided to head over to Covent Garden and lose our British fish & chips virginity together.The place was pretty busy for a Sunday night, but we were lucky enough to be seated within 20 minutes, despite the place being absurdly cramped. My friend and I shared a cod with chips. It was pretty amazing -- the fish was huge and perfectly cooked, the batter wasn't overly greasy or tasteless, and I actually liked the chips, though not everyone in my group did. The tartar sauce and malt vinegar were amazing. They went perfectly with the fish. The fish and chips alone were \u00a310, so it was a pretty pricey meal, but if you're not starving, definitely share with someone else -- the portions were huge.",

    "text": "The 'Rock & Sole Plaice' is supposedly London's oldest surviving Fish & Chip shop after being established in 1871. The painted sign in the window reads established 1874; on the menu it says 1871. Est. 1949 says the contradictory receipt. In fact, owner Hassan Ziyaeddin moved to London in 1960, and we could find nothing to substantiate his claim to be Londons oldest surviving fish and chip restaurant. The fish & chip shop is located on a corner, it's fairly small and fairly cramped. I guess there must be about six to nine tables on the ground floor. Opposite the tables you will find the counter where customers can collect and take away. There's the option to dine upstairs in amongst the hustle and bustle of the takeaway service or to venture downstairs to the other calmer restaurant area. Classic cod and chips is the star of the menu but more adventurous options include tuna and Dover sole. I don't eat fish and coming from a port would never trust London fish but I am told it is good. The chips are fine Chunky chips and it's all cooked in peanut oil, which makes it a marginally healthier option than usual. It has had some bad reviews elsewhere (and good ones) so maybe a veggie is not the right person to review it.",

If you don't have a big appetite this place is not worth the money though, at \u00a310 per portion that better be a damn posh bit of fish. A while ago this place had some fantastic chinese lanterns outside which made it a really romantic place to eat but I haven't seen them up in a while. What is good about this place though is the fact that even though it's not the original owners (this is the oldest fish and chip shop in London you know?! - jellied eels anyone) the current owners use all the old passed down traditional recipes. Mushy peas are as good as mine, the fish cakes are beautiful (NB only order one they are HUGE) and the tartar sauce is homemade. Mmmmm.... I know what I want for tea now!",

NOTE there are many more tables than meets the eye when you walk in, and don't be distracted by all the people getting takeaway meals - they have table service and a full bar.Mrs G ordered plaice and chips whereas I had rock fish. We both loved our meals and the service was great. For my American friends - try rock fish when you see it over here in the UK. Delicious and last night was no exception - their oil is very fresh and the fish too! Yummy!! Rock fish is any small shark that they catch off the coast of the UK. Hence - none of the annoying small bones in all other fish. It has a flaky but slightly meaty consistency, white and a wonderful delicate flavor - in my case souses in malt vinegar the way we Brits love it.Yes we will be back soon!!",

A regular for \u00a314.50 is plenty for one person which is a good thing considering the price tag but I was so disappointed with the chips being soggy. I also thought the Beef and Onion Pie (\u00a37.50) was just decent and forgettable. Maybe they can do better with dessert? We ordered Banana Fritters (\u00a34) to share and when asked if we wanted it with ice cream, we couldn't say no. I thought she meant \"a la mode\" but instead, we were given a whole bowl of grocery-bought ice cream with 4 mini scoops on the side. The annoying part? We got the bill and was charged extra (\u00a35) for it. Ugh. I hate servers who up-sell. What's worse, she even added an automatic 10% service fee. Wow. And no free Wi-Fi in this tourist trap.",

I asked for table service (as you do in the U.K.,) and was immediately guided to a table. Food: I asked for the large haddock meal with chips, and was told they were out, but had the regular size, which I went with. I was curious how big a large fish was going to be :-) The plate that arrived was more than enough for one. The fish was fresh and cooked perfectly, with a crunchy and crisp batter. It's deep fried, so expect a little grease, which was minimal considering. Chips were not as crispy as the fish, but decent. Tartar sauce comes on the side in a little plastic container. It was delicious, but the portion could be bigger considering the size of fish. There are mayo and tomato sauce packets provided on the table. Service: Efficient, and they turn tables quickly. The fish was served within a few minutes, and the drink showed up a few moments later. Cost: Bit on the high side, but it's central London. A regular haddock and Fanta Orange ran me \u00a319.50. Table service does cost about \u00a32 more than take out. Overall: Fresh and well cooked fish. Lots of seating, even for the solo traveler. Restrooms for customers only.",

The fries were crispy but wasn't the best fries i had. The pickles and pickled onions were a nice touch with the fish and chips. The tarter sauce paired nicely with the fish.

Example: regular cod/chips to take away? 8.50. Same thing at one of their tables? 14.50. \u00a0Is there anything about the service or table itself that is worth 6 pounds?? No. On service: I asked for a beer. Did not come. When my food came, I asked for it again, and they waited until I was almost finished with my meal before bringing it out. On the table: it's really just a normal table.

A bit expensive, but the portions are massive and come with chips. Importantly, the batter is pretty tasty. And it's one of the few chippies that has a sit-in area you actually don't mind sitting in all that much.Tourists and locals alike could do much worse.It's certainly one of the better fish 'n' chip shops I've been to in London.(For the record, I'd choose Rock & Sole Plaice a million times over the Golden Hind. yelp.co.uk/biz/the-golde\u2026)",

While we all ordered the same fish, some was colder than other, and less crispy. \u00a02.) The Chips were not that great. \u00a0Mine were cold while my fish was hot. \u00a0But my wifes were hot with her fish colder.3.) Malt Vinegar was weak. 4.)

I've loved fish and chips even before moving to the UK and these were truly a notch above most and worth slogging through Covent Garden for. Great fish and equally important... great chips! Good potato flavor and ratio of potato to friedness. Fish is really nice and tender. I didn't find any tiny hidden fish bones. It drives me crazy when I find those because it makes me paranoid I'll choke and die which turns dinner into something kind of stressful... We were too stuffed to finish the mushy peas, but they were quite good. Not too crazy green in color and tasted just like fresh peas.The restaurant is really small. A step above hole in the wall (which I mean in the American English sense of \"a kind of dingy, but authentic\" place not an ATM!). They're really efficient about the whole thing though.",

They told us that the larger fish wasn't ready yet so it would be about 10 mins. \u00a0We decided to wait and placed our order, so they asked if we could wait outside since it was pretty busy and crowded. \u00a0There was a constant line of people coming in to order and take away since all of the tables (kind of cafeteria-style, first come, first serve) were full. \u00a0You can watch them make the food because of the large window into the open kitchen. \u00a0I wish I hadn't. \u00a0I watched the same guy who was handling cash, go over and pick up the fish for an order, with his bare fingers and put it on a plate for a customer. \u00a0No one was wearing any gloves. \u00a0So think about this: the same guy who scratches his butt is using the same hands and skin to pick your food up. \u00a0That food will go into your mouth. \u00a0I guess I am just used to there being health restrictions and certain ways you handle food. \u00a0Anyways, 30 mins later, after reminding them about our order twice, and watching about 20 different people walk in and out with their order, they still hadn't given me my food. \u00a0Again, went into remind them and after another 10 mins, I went back to my flat. \u00a0Food: not even worth it. \u00a0The fish was mediocre at best with a crappy batter. \u00a0The chips were even worse. \u00a0Not crisp at all. \u00a0If you like american onion rings, don't order the ones here. \u00a0They're dried out and the batter is gross. \u00a0Overall: \u00a0horrible food, even more horrible service, terrible hygiene, which makes it a I would rather eat McDonalds than this place.",

    "text": "After my trip down the Thames to Richmond I came back to London by train and worked up quite the appetite at the Seven Dials Club drinking a few pints with friends. I confessed to my friend Steve that I have yet to have a great fish and chips meal in London. Steve suggested that we have a nice meal of Fish and Chips at the Rock and Sole Plaice located in Covent Garden which is within walking distance of the Seven Dials; what a great suggestion! Rock and Sole Plaice is a small restaurant offering indoor seating as well as sidewalk seating. The sidewalk seating which is where we ate has tables of 6 so if you are a small party be prepared to have others seated at your table but no worries, I noticed that when strangers were seated together they enjoyed each others conversation and who knows, sharing your meal with a stranger or two could enhance your meal!?We started with an appetizer or \"starter\" as they say of Hummus and warm pita bread. The Hummus was nice and creamy with a generous pour of olive oil, the pita was very soft and fresh and was the perfect bread to accompany the hummus. My entree was a large serving of Cod that was battered and deep fried and served with home cut fries or \"Chips\" as they say over here. I have to say that the fish was very fresh and the batter was crunchy and I loved every bit of the meal. The chips were nice and thick, cooked perfectly and with a couple sprinkles of malted vinegar tasted great. We finished the meal with a bottle of house white wine which I think was a nice Pinot GrigioI'd definitely return to the Rock and Sole Plaice.",

I like the idea of giving people decent tables, serving beer etc with the fish and chips. However it just was not that good. I do not eat fish and chips that much in London. My mrs is not bothered and I \u00a0save myself for when I return to my homeland of South Yorkshire (where I know a few lovely places). However I have had better fish and chips in London and for much cheaper. There's a chippy in Earsfield (Wandsworth Town end of Garrat Lane) that was close to where I lived, that is much better. There was no cod ready and the haddock was ok. Chips not bad and mushy pies pretty nice. I quite enjoyed it, but object to having to pay 20 quid for it all. I am sure they will keep pulling the wool over the eyes of American's, Italians, Spaniards and Asian's (that is those that do not know good fish and chips) but if you are English then do not bother. Just simply go to your local chippy. That or try a restaurant.",

The batter was not overly thick or greasy, probably some of the best fried fish I've had. Tartar sauce was also good with fresh dill in it. The chips were just average at best. They were thick but some tasted a little raw and some were overly cooked. If rating on just the fish alone I would give it 5 stars, but taking in price and the ok chips, I can only give 3.",

If that alone doesn't make you a believer, get the fried cod, rock, or haddock and chips (thick cut steak-fry style deliciousness), douse it with some lemon and malt vinegar, and let these fried pieces of heaven melt in your mouth for the best chippy experience in the world! They even serve it to-go in a neat newspaper cone to take for the road for a little stroll to nearby Covent Gardens or Leicester Square.

On the first occasion, when I went with my Mum we both ordered the regular cod and chips and we could've easily shared one portion between us! The mushy peas were okay but what was amazing was the tartare sauce, it was simply beautiful! We also shared a bottle of Merlot which was delicious too and a snip at only \u00a314.When I returned two days later, I had cod roe which was amazing too. Unfortunately this time my friend and I chanced a glass of the house red as we were in a rush, and it was horrid - like cheap vinegar! In a great Covent Garden location and now a bit of a tourist trap, but still attracting locals and self-respecting Londoners alike, it's worth a visit - just make sure you go armed with an appetite!

Especially a place that serves British staple food like fish and chips.Shopkeeper: Oh, you don't want to eat English food. It's not very good. You should go try Indian or Chinese. They're very good and you can find any restaurant here that serves good Chinese and Indian.Me: -_____-\"So what happened to my 2006 British food adventure? Had some terrible pizza, whatever sandwiches and salads.. Oh, I did take up her suggestion and tried some Chinese. She was right, the Chinese was not bad here.After much discouragement back in 2006, I decided this time around I'd just go with my gut and find some good ol' English food. Rock & Sole Plaice was the first stop of my British food tour redux. It was conveniently located in the hip, Covent Garden, within the proximity of my hostel, and with a name like that, I had to give it a try!My fiance and I had to wait a bit since this place was extremely crowded, even during the late hours. The establishment claims that they were the very first to serve, or was it invent fish and chips? Anyway, once we finally got seated out in their patio, we ordered their popular dish, cod and chips. The plate came piping hot with 2 generous sized cod fish (I'd say each piece was a half of the cod fish) and wedges of potatoes. The cod was lightly battered, crispy golden brown, and not greasy. Very delish! All-in-all, a great recovery from my last trip. I definitely recommend Rock & Sole Plaice for some good ol' fashion British fish and chips.Food: British classicAmbiance: al fresco in Rainy London",

    "text": "Thank heavens for mushy peas! Our party of 5 heard nothing, but rave reviews about this spot, which made us very eager to check it out. When we arrived the restaurant was extremely crowded! We thought that was a good sign. We made our way in and told the staff behind the counter that there were 5 of us. She quickly directed us to come to her. She led us through the kitchen and down the stairs. To an overly cramped lower level. The tables were pushed so tightly together we could not even access the three chairs against the wall. In order for each of us to have a seat we needed those chairs. We separated our table, two of us squeezed in and then pushed the table back together. We were left with our menus and began to determine our choice of fish. It wasn't a very large menu, so we were shocked when it took forever for anyone to check back with us or even take our drink order. When the server appeared we felt we better get it all in at once. An order of calamari, one order of mushy peas, 5 Efes Pilsener, 3 Cod and 2 Halibut. Our food arrived and we dug right in. Unfortunately, either our taste buds are off or we did not receive the same glorious fish and chips everyone else raves about. It was nothing special. The chips were soggy and cold, not a good combination. We had finished picking at the tasteless meal and were ready to go. We hadn't seen our server since he delivered our meal. After waiting for what seemed like an eternity we decide to head upstairs and hunt our check down ourselves. People are pouring in and out. All 5 of us are standing there trying to pay our check. It was so ridiculous. Seriously? Do you want our money or not? Well, you got it this time, but I can assure you there won't be a next.",

Our cod was fresh and fried perfectly golden and crispy on the outside, moist and flaky on the inside and not too heavy and greasy at all accompanied by lemon and tartar sauce and accompanied chips were tasty as well. \u00a0I wanted to try their famed mushy peas but was too full, next time!Joanna's mission to eat some good fish and chips accomplished!",

I had the regular sized-cod with mushy peas and curry sauce. The fish was moist and a good sized portion, like others have said, the tartar sauce really is the best part -- I just wish they served it in gallon-sized portions rather than the tiny little plastic cups they used (I briefly considered licking the dish but opted not to). The chips were solid wedges, hot and crispy. The curry sauce had a nice, slightly sweet/smoky flavor to it that was nice as well. \u00a0My only qualm, as others have mentioned, was the rather high cost -- an average sized plat of fish and chips (nothing added) was 18+ pounds. Like the good tourist I am, I took the price in stride and decided to complain on yelp several days later.",

And the food is not good. I ate there this evening, sitting at a barely vacated place, which was quickly cleaned with a cloth that left the table looking like a house in a monsoon. The food arrived immediately, and the paper napkin wrapped knife and fork squelched down on the dripping surface. Lifting the cutlery out of the moisture, I took out a paper towel to swab the table down, and one of the waiters tried to throw the towel away before I'd swabbed the deck properly.I've eaten there before, after a few drinks and my dim memory suggested it was OK, but unless you are pissed, rich and have had your tastebuds surgically removed, I suggest you avoid it.",

Very popular with locals and tourists. Averagely priced. Quickly served. Traditional fish n chips at it's best. Serves all the extra sauces, curry sauce is a must.",
