Left feeling full and strangely healthy since their ingredients and preparation was not the usual greasy diner food. \u00a0A lovely little brunch spot!",

    "text": "I was so so excited to see that Friends of Ours had come to our neighborhood! My first visit to the cafe was in a rush on the way to an appt, but I couldn't resist stopping in and seeing what I could grab as takeaway - The team whipped up the smashed avocado with chilli chutney and smoked bacon and after one bite I knew this would be a brand new love affair. \u00a0My second visit didn't go as great - my partner and I popped over for Saturday brunch around 12:30PM - the cafe was buzzing and I promised myself I would try something else from the menu and went for the sweet potato and courgette rosti. \u00a0Though a different and nice taste, it couldn't compete with the avocado order (which my partner ordered and said was a under overripe). \u00a0The service seemed to be quite new to it so we had a wait quite a while to get our orders and the check - but still a very friendly crew. \u00a0We watched a couple next to us receive the wrong dish which the team was very apologetic for and offered some homemade chocolates on the house (not typical in London!). \u00a0Coffee-wise: I wasn't a massive fan of my latte - which again seemed to be churned out rather quickly and not given some of the attention of the millions of coffee houses in Shoreditch. As i'm still enamoured with my first taste of the homemade chili chutney I won't write off Friends of Ours just yet. I also had a chance to interact with the team a bit and am excited for the concept and have quite a few different menu items to still try. I'm sure once they get more in the swing of their increasing neighborhood popularity this will be an even bigger hit!",

This space has an open ambience with a great fit-out to match. Ordered scrambled eggs on toast with mushroom and avocado, all exceptional. On a second visit, Man recognised me, addressed me by name, shook my hand and had recalled my order from several days earlier. Best customer service I've experienced across many recent cafe visits in Sydney, LA, NYC and London. 'Friends of ours' feels an appropriate name at this point.Just to top it off, coffee is fantastic and nice to see Bonsoy being used, unlike some of the questionable substitutes I've had recently at a similar price point.Highly recommended!",

In fact, I've been back three weeks in a row, and dragged friends along to it too.Popped away back on Pitfield St (which should be renamed Brunch Row), it's a neat little cafe with light decor and plenty of small tables. You can sit outside too. And, best of all, it understands that brunch on a weekend should really be served all day long, as the ability to get out of bed before 11am is severely limited. They serve amazing (Ozone) coffee - their flat white is perfect - along with more unusual drinks like matcha lattes. They also do beautiful smoothies - which you can have with almond milk to make dairy free - and juices. Carrot, ginger & orange juice has cured my cold for good. As for the food - it's stunning. Avocado on toast has been remixed with sweet chili chutney, and served with a soft poached egg. It's their best selling dish and you have to try it. The salmon (fresh in as a special on that day) benedict was juicy and thick on an English muffin with spinach and dill hollandaise. The breakfast skillet comes piping hot, with eggs studded with chorizo and beans. And brioche french toast with ginger cream was thick and sweet. I'm salivating just thinking of it.To top it all off, the service is wonderful - the owners serve you personally and are great for a friendly chat and take such obvious pride in their place.May Friends of Ours be the massive success it deserves to be.",

I will return to try some of the dishes I saw being served because they were visually stunning and inventive. Yum.",

In the heart of a great neighborhood (keep your eyes peeled for Banksy and Shepard Fairey within a block of each other. Shoreditch is definitely street art paradise). Back to the place - you can make reservations on their website, but in our experience it wasn't necessary. My wife and I went here twice with only three days in London.",

It's a tiny little place, so don't bring your whole crew. But what they may lack in size they totally make up for with fantastic people, a gorgeous interior, delicious food, and tons of heart. When I first walked in, the two gents working were incredibly helpful. I truly felt like they wanted to take care of me. I started with a flat white, which was perfect -- no sugar needed whatsoever. Then when I couldn't decide which of the daily salads I wanted, they offered me a bit of both -- with a side of steak, of course. It was all, once again, perfect. The salads were light and refreshing, and the steak was delicious and cooked exactly how I like it -- medium. Nom freaking nom. They also have lots of baked treats that looked amazing, and Colleen definitely confirmed my suspicion. If you're in Shoreditch, be sure to put this little gem on your must-try list!",

During the British summer, sitting outside is highly recommended.The menu for food and drinks are both extensive, but not overwhelming, and feature fresh twists on brunch classics. I went with mushrooms on toast with a side of smashed avo. The ensemble was great and plated beautifully (definitely Insta-worthy), but a bit lacking in several respects: you receive a single poached egg you can/must share between the two toasts (and likely contributed to my still being hungry upon leaving), the mushrooms were ample, but under-seasoned, the pesto is potentially the highlight of the meal and was perfectly done.Just a few minutes from Old Street station but off of busy streets, the atmosphere and solid brunch are sure to bring me back.",

We stopped in for a few coffees Saturday morning and it was pleasantly plump with chattering brunchers. I like what I see. My flat white was delicious -- made superbly, and using Ozone Coffee. Again, I'm going all fangirl over here. I'm justsoexcitedforthisplace. It's a small shop -- comfortable seating for about 20 with takeaway coffee and pastries. The cafe serves quite nice dishes as well (I had serious egg envy of the gentlemen eating in the window) -- and I am confident I'll be back many many days to indulge in their menu. For now a flat white, but I've got a 5-star bet on this place. Passionate people doing great things, and in my street? Welcome!",

It's very relaxing in here and the owners and staff are so nice. They came around to talk to us and were so friendly.I ordered the scrambled eggs with chili and bacon on sourdough. My friend ordered the breakfast skillet. Both were excellent, as was my soy latte. They use Ozone Coffee. This is great because I hate Ozone's food, so now I can just come here and it's closer to my place.The orange juice as fresh, definitely try that and make room for the carrot cake! Oh my we were eyeing that the entire time and decided to go for it when the couple next to us recommended it. It was worth it. However, that and the second lattes tipped me over the edge and I had to walk off the brunch and then come home and lie down. Major food coma!I'll be back. Very often. Like this place a lot.",

    "text": "As typical Australian brunch lovers, the 4.5 stars given to Friends of Ours on Yelp meant it was a must go. The cafe was quite crowded when we went, giving a slight cramped and uncomfortable feel. We decided on the beetroot and corn fritters following recommendations that we do so. Presentation was lovely and fresh, and the balance of flavours was done nicely. However the fritters themselves were quite doughy and hard to swallow. There was a wide selection of pastries from the counter ranging from Anzac biscuits to carrot cake. Overall, the meal was satisfying and tasty. Does it deserve such a high rating? Based upon my visit alone, probably not.",

It is also bloody brilliant for sweet toothed breakfast enthusiasts or coffee fiends. And egg crazy, sourdough fans. Ok, it suits anyone who eats or drinks. Menu changes seasonally. At the moment crab on toast with AV and a poach egg addition is rocking my world. They also have ramen after 11:30 which was unlike any ramen I have ever had. Yum. Lobster with wasabi hollandaise and eggs, baked mexi eggs. Crumpets with all of the beautiful trimmings. Everything is good!Their coffee is from NZ coffee roasters, now London locals, ozone coffee and the place it's self is riddled by Aussie staff who are genetically used to getting up pre 8am on purpose so they are always friendly and fun to have a chat to.Not a huge amount of seating so if you have to wait DO IT. Totally worth it. Get yourself a takeaway coffee and your loyalty card and hover over someone with empty plates. Yum",

Yes, they are that good!! Sooo very very good. We got there just after 1pm and it was pretty busy inside. There were about 6 people in the queue and all the members of staff were busy too. However we were acknowledged quickly and a table was available within 10mins! I ordered the smoked trout and my friend ordered the sweetcorn & beetroot fritter. The trout was very fresh and the cuts were chunky. Absolutely delicious with fluffy scrambled eggs.The real winner was the fritters. Oh my what an explosion of flavour! Everything worked out well and the spices were on point. I'm still drooling thinking about this dish. Maybe the best brunch dish I've ever had. That good! Coffee was excellent. Smooth and rich. Impeccable & friendly service.Can't wait to visit again!",

You didn't get it wrong!What a lovely little place. I first want to mention the owner - what a guy. Polite and accommodating from the get go. I walked in and told him I was meeting 3 others, he offered me the large table at the back and then brought me over some water. Half way through our meeting a large group came in so we politely moved seats to a smaller table and the owner helped us with our drinks and thanked us numerous times.Then once I was back on my own, I chose my breakfast - scrambled eggs on toast with a side of bacon. It came literally within 5 minutes and was cooked to perfection. The eggs were fluffy and creamy, bacon crispy but not over done and toast wonderfully crunchy. Ever mouthful was spot on! About 5 mins after I'd finished another group came in and the owner asked if I'd move to another table. I obliged as at the end of the day their a business and I didn't mind budging. The owner came over and thanked me again and offered me a free drink. I refused as I was ready to head but I thought that was very kind of him. I would definite head back here to give some of the other food options a try - they have a great looking baked eggs dish which is just calling my name! Very pleasant morning in a very pleasant coffee shop!",

We thought we had booked online but this is only an estimated waiting time. At the door we were told it would be a 20 minute wait so we put our names down. After 20 minutes we came back and ended up waiting a further 40 minutes before we got seated (by this point we were throughly frozen). Now this is through no fault of the staff, they kept us notified and it's so unpredictable as people would hold up tables by ordering coffee / desserts after their meals but I think they need to come up with a new system, particularly in the cold weather. Possibly they could take people's numbers and call or text when the table is ready. Unless they change the waiting system I wouldn't really recommend visiting at busy times like the weekend.",

My colleague stayed for lunch and a peak at her salad gave me some serious food envy.We sat at the high table at the back and basically set up shop. Seriously, we had everything required of the urban office: wifi strong enough for a skype call, outlets to recharge... there was even a spare Mac charger was lying around.

You can tell he locals love this place because as I sat here there were regulars coming in and out socializing with the two folks working. They have a nice looking menu with great brunch items. I came for breakfast after Instagram stalking them all week and just drooling over their amazing pictures. Even their drinks look beautiful! They have a menu once you walk inside of their iced teas and I was hooked instantly by the Hojicha and Assam iced tea with fresh strawberries, mint, AND a nice grapefruit slice. So incredibly refreshing! And the presentation was legit! I ordered their Ham Hock Benny with mustard hollandaise and potatoes. I liked how the poached eggs were presented on top of the potatoes and there wasn't any bread below. Personally prefer this style! The mustard hollandaise was nice because it was not overpowering with the mustard taste. I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu! Keep up with their IG page to get inspired to come in since they have some amazing menu changes for each season. Also, if the weather is nice sit out on the patio!",

How do you make your food so pretty? And say what? It tastes good too!!! NO WAY! We came here for my friend's birthday lunch and I can say it did not disappoint. All 4 of us ordered something different and everyone cleaned their plates, having something in particular they loved about each one: Smoked Corn and Beetroot Fritters- She really loved the tomato-y sauce that accompanied the whole dish. Trout and Croquettes- She really loved the croquettes, made of sweet potato and deliciousness. Matcha Latte- best matcha latte birthday girl's ever had. I tried it too, it's particularly creamy and yum. Smashed Avocado- I loved that they incorporated beetroot puree with feta puree- it was an amazing combo of flavours. Brunch Muffin- look at that thing! It's ginormous! And then it was all gone, because it was so good. Friends of Ours was an absolute treat and a place I will definitely take my husband, because I need to share this wonderfulness with him.",

Not withstanding getting a \u00a0great spot by the window overseeing when the masses come to find a seat (Come early) but Friendly staff and their star dish of sweet corn and beetroot fritters is sensational. Roasted Golden Beetroot, kasundi, feta, baby mint, smashed avocado, coriander and to top it off a poached egg perched on top it's an amazing dish. I'm a full on carnivore who barely orders a pure veg dish and yes I ordered bacon on the side but you don't need it. The fritter is meaty in texture it's a totally star dish. The ocean trout and scrambled eggs is ace too. And I must shout out the coffee which is superb along with its chai latte.Pretty much now will become my go to place if in in area although I want to test out a few more in area which are highly rated. Well done guys and girls I was so impressed by everything about my experience.",

They arrived and just looked breathtaking - a tower of avocado, with purpley fritters and a poached egg just waiting to be cut on the top.. Mmmm what ensued was a yolk drizzled mound of deliciousness!! Oh my word... Simply the dish to travel London for! Our other choice - the trout and scrambled eggs was delicious and was a definite a nice addition to our food.: but for me it's all about the fritters!! A huge shout out for the service! They were super friendly and took time to make recommendations and even advised about which table was best for light to take pictures!! These people know!! 5 star perfection!

And feta!) 2. The waitress addressed all my requests, including having the egg fried instead of poached, adding a small helping of the (phenomenal) beetroot hummus as a side at no extra cost and switching out the green drink for a skinny chai latte. All with a smile. I got this: \u00a39\"SWEETCORN & BEETROOT FRITTERS\"roasted golden beetroot, kasundi, feta, baby mint, poached egg, smashed avocado, coriander (vegetarian) (gluten free)It is awesome. I was worried these would be crunchy fried but they are more like pan-fried. There are two (or three?) fritters stacked atop each other like a tower, with avo in between. It's actually more filling than I thought it would be. The chai latte was mediocre but the food more than made up for it. The place gets packed quick and there's no rez system which stinks but we waited only about 5-10 minutes on a queue outside when we arrived about 11:30am this past Saturday.I also got the lamington and a chocolate chip cookie for takeaway. The cookie in particular, despite being crispy more than chewy (a sin to me), was excellent. It was full of choco chips.",
