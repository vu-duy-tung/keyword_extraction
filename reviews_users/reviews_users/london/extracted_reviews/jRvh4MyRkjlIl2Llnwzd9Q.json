The eggs were quite nicely cooked, though. My companion's croque monsieur was drowned in an artificial-tasting bechamel. Sort out your sauces, please! Given the quality, value for money on the food was non-existent. The worst thing, though, was that our waitress tried to keep the change - presumably as a tip - even though this establishment already applies a service charge. It was embarrassing to have to ask for it back (after a 20 minute wait).",

    "text": "Decent food and value, but absolutely disgraceful service that they should be thoroughly ashamed of. We will not be going there again due to the service, which was so bad that it ruined an otherwise tasty meal. I went to the one at Hayes Galleria near London Bridge. The waiter who seated us was extremely friendly and courteous, but the waitress who took our orders and served us was extremely rude and grumpy and thoroughly let her colleagues and restaurant down. We had to wait 45 minutes in a nearly empty restaurant for our starters (soup), then a further 30 minutes for our mains. What was worse, once we gave in and asked where our mains had got to, the waiter went straight into the kitchen and brought them out instantaneously, so they had obviously been sitting around and no-one had bothered to bring them to us. The waitress was rude and grumpy, took one person's plates away when the other 3 of us had not finished eating, poured more wine to our designated driver without asking. When I asked for a certain main course, the waitress said bluntly none left, no apology, no friendliness, just a grumpy reply. As a slap in the face for me, I later saw that main being delivered to another table who had arrived and ordered after us. To add insult to injury, when we got our bill, they had added a huge service charge to it (\u00a37.50 for a meal that came to less than \u00a350). After such appalling service, this added insult to injury and we didn't know whether to laugh or cry at this cheek and we did not pay this. No complaints about the food, it was good, but the service is the worst I have ever experienced.",

Can be a bit noisy. Best to book in advance, but was able to get a table on the same day. Wanted a French restaurant where my business associate could find his favourite (steak tartare) and I could pick something that wouldn't interfere with the restrictive diet I'm on at the moment. Waiting staff allowed me to order the meat without the sauce and to choose the accompanying vegetables from a different main course. Portions are quite large \u00a0I couldn't finish mine. Ordered only non alcoholic drinks without receiving any black looks. Only small problem was that it took a bit too long to find someone to bring the bill.",

The atmosphere is incredible for a date or a night out with some of your classier friends. (Make that one t-shirt wearing friend pop on a collar and come along too!)I don't remember the last time that I was treated so well in a restaurant. Everyone was incredibly friendly and very kind and patient. Our server (I wish I'd asked her name, as she is someone to be sought out if you're eating here... she's really small and has her hair cut pretty short. Big smile.)On to the meal!We enjoyed the Goats Cheese Tartine (Chargrilled sourdough bread with soft goats cheese, roasted baby artichokes and black olive tapenade), the Mushroom Crepes (Baked cr\u00e9pes with mushrooms, spinach and gruy\u00e8re cheese - these were INSANELY delicious), and a lobster dish as our main course. Jessica assured me that it would just be a lobster tail or something because the price seemed so low compared to what it would be in America. When it came out it was a lobster chopped in half with all of the meat still inside the shell. SO weird!!! But she took charge and tore the meat out. It was delicious, though I did not really care for the process. After our main course we enjoyed a chocolate concoction that made Jessica close her eyes... it was so rich and delicious. For beverages I enjoyed a beer called Kasteel Cru which is brewed with champagne yeast. Easily one of the best beers I've ever had. I'll be looking for a case in Paris so I can ship it home and let you all try it. We also enjoyed a bottle of the Maison L`Aiglon Chardonnay 2009, Vin De Pays D'Oc (Melon and pineapple with subtle toasty oak) - which was a very, very delicious bottle of wine.Oh! The prices are very reasonable as well! GO GO GO!",

However, I decided to venture in and give the place a go. And what a good decision that was! My dining buddy and myself were seated in good time and at a lovely table. Water and bread came so quickly that I felt it was summoned by god, however at no time did it come across that we were being rushed, despite the restaurant being to capacity. I ordered scallops to start with and we shared the most mouth wateringly sumptuous rib of beef. I get my fair share enjoyment out of life but I have to say this beef excited me to levels I only thought were possible with Tahitian swimsuit models. The scallops were not bad either and came with fantastically crispy bacon. All this was washed down with a gorgeous bottle of Pinot Noir and rounded off with a cheese board. A wonderful meal was had by my friend and I however, I did manage to walk straight into the ladies toiletsI either put this down to poor signage or excellent wine.",

It's become one of my favourites - not as inexpensive as you'd expect for what's become a chain (Covent Garden, Soho Wimbledon), and in a very slightly higher class perhaps than Strada, though with a different and fairly rare offering; French food based on the southern style; pissaladi\u00e8re, described on the menu as a flatbread, is a Ni\u00e7oise adaptation of pizza, (usually) without a cheese base and with caramelised onions, herbs, tomato or anchovies. You'll find a good tuna ni\u00e7oise, proven\u00e7ale sauce with the (deliciously tender) chicken, mouth-watering pots au chocolat - just what you'd find if you were on the C\u00f4te. Steaks are magnificent and I've found to the continental taste. Order medium and it'll be arrive cooked at the well-done end; medium-rare is what an American might call bleu. So be careful what you wish for! Service is very good, and the atmosphere pleasant. Sit upstairs for a more relaxed vibe (the basement can be a bit airless) and in the right-hand room for more intimacy. Expect to pay around \u00a350 for three courses with wine, if you're going to town on dinner. Which of course, you will be.",

Note that they offer complementary filtered water and come regularly to refill it and to check that all is going well. The deco is very well done, sort of modern French retro brasserie style, very elegant and clean. A great address in Soho and a good French restaurant full stop.",

I went there with a friend for a birthday lunch, she had Risotto with broad and green beans, spinach and herbs (and what a lot of herbs!) whilst I had linguine with seafood, chilli and garlic. Both dishes were robust, filling and perfectly cooked. The pasta was al dente whilst the risotto wasn't 'gluey'. The seafood was fresh and perfectly cooked (soft rather than rubbery) whilst the risotto was packed with herbs and vegetables. My dining companion, not known for subtlety in the face of poor food or service was generous with her compliments, commenting with a hearty smack of the lips 'THAT was nice'. It was, and some. Cote have branches in Wimbledon and Richmond with plans to open in Covent Garden soon. On a sunny late September lunchtime, being here was not dis-similar to suddenly being in the Marais district of Paris on a late Summer's day. Ah, magical memories.",

The only moan I can really have is that they brought us the Lunch menu, (we arrived at about 1.15), we chose from it then was told the menu was only available from 3pm to 7pm! Bit ridiculous since lunch is usually 12pm to maybe 2.30 however, to make up for it we got our first drinks free as an apology. I think if the company changed this policy for the timing of the lunchtime menu it would be quite perfect - they could of course just change the name of the menu!!!",

It is located in a central Soho position and I rate it highly and after a number of visits over the past few years have never had a bad experience there and can only recommend it. They have a good range of food and good wine on offer but I really rate their 2 and 3 course deals which are good value, delicious with a good variety of dishes to try. The service is always good, polite, friendly and quick considering it is always busy but the staff seem to cope well with this, particularly if you say you're in a rush.Highly recommended.",

The only negative thing is that this is one of a chain of 10 restaurants, but the formula is polished and well-done.Our service was nicely handled and our server attentive and professional and very French (no coffee?) I ordered cider because I just felt like it and got a cloudy bottle of a boutique brand that didn't exactly go well with my fish pie, but I didn't care! The fish pie was filled with salmon, haddock and prawns and topped with cheesy mashed potatoes piped on in a lattice pattern. The waiter also offered up complimentary after-dinner liquor which was a nice touch to thank customers. I recommend Cote if you have 30 quid to spend on a leisurely dinner, but I'm sure you can spend less also.",

Finally I got my opportunity to eat here, and am pleased to say that it fully lived up to my expectations.The restaurant, which is large and on two floors- still manages to retain a feel of intimacy because it is divided up by wood panelled walls. We were seated in a booth (every restaurant should have booths), and our friendly waitress gave us plenty of help in deciding what to get. My friend decided on the reasonably priced 2 course menu for \u00a39.95 (making it 3 courses is only \u00a32.00 more expensive) and had a warm beetroot and goats cheese salad to start, and spatchcock for a main. I had a Roquefort salad with endive followed by a wild mushroom and spinach crepe, washed down with a couple of Kir Royals. We both raved about our dishes, so much so that we didn't even want to share!The desserts looked equally as tempting, but all we could manage was to share a dish of berries with heated white chocolate sauce poured over. The meal came to \u00a320.00 a head, including service, which we were more than happy with. A top choice.",

I would definitely put Cote on my list for a special and slightly more dressed-up occasion - pre-theatre or Easter brunch or the like.The food was immaculately presented (even the pomme frites look regal wrapped in a flourish of white gauzy paper), mouthwateringly savoury, and just-right in portion (nothing to excess... perhaps even leaving you wanting just a smidge more - which I think is how all distinguished dining should be). \u00a0My friend and I started with the olives (always a must!), flatbread with cheese and thyme (this was richer and more decadent than I expected - but in a good way), and the Roquefort and endive salad (fresh and succulent, but the Roquefort dressing was runny and tasteless to the extent of being practically pointless...). \u00a0For our mains, I had the cheese crepes and my friend had one of their steaks - we found them to be respectively delectable and deeply satisfying... I don't think it gets much better than melted Gruyere for a vegetarian, nor a well-aged steak for a carnivore! \u00a0 As an aside, one of the other reviewers mentioned a set-price menu of two to three courses... this didn't seem to be an option when we were there - everything was a la carte... and you definitely couldn't get a starter AND a main for anything close to \u00a39.95... but still well-worth the price!",

    "text": "I visited the Soho branch of Cote last Thursday, on a lovely balmy summers evening, with a largish crowd of around 10. We arrived pretty much on time for once and we were swiftly shown to our table in the basement area. Even though it was only 7pm the restaurant was pretty full and there was a nice buzzy atmosphere. Bottles of the house white and red were quickly provided while we were giving the classic French bistro style menu, which has plenty of choices to suit most tastes, the once over. I think it's always a bit of challenge for staff when dealing with a large group but we were handled beautifully all night, and without too much stress we had soon been cagouled into making our choices - no mean feat with this crowd. I was sitting with my old pal Broggy and we decided to split our starters, so we shared a goat's cheese tartine with sourdough bread and a crab mayonnaise. Both were nicely presented, well-seasoned, very tasty and a very decent size portion. I then moved onto a main of the 10oz rib eye steak which came with a dainty portion of frites on the side; I teamed this up with some b\u00e9arnaise sauce which was an extra and added a couple of pounds to the bill. My steak came medium rare as I had requested, this was well-seasoned and had a good char. It was a very tasty piece of the meat and a pleasure to eat, which is more than I can say for some steaks I have had the misfortune to order in other chain restaurants in central London. Our group ordered a pretty wide variety of dishes from the menu and everyone seemed pretty pleased with their meal. By this point I was a bit too stuffed for dessert but I did try a spoonful of Broggy's cr\u00e8me brulee which was perfectly ok but nothing out of the ordinary. Throughout the evening all our dishes were served at the same time, came to the table hot, were cooked as ordered and came without too much of a wait; in my experience this kind of service is something of a rarity when you are dining with a large party in central London. The wine list is good if you are keeping an eye on your wallet with house wine under \u00a315 and plenty to choice from under \u00a320. As far as chain restaurants go this is my favourite in London by a country mile and it does what it says on the tin: \"simple, freshly prepared French food at value for money prices\". We left sometime around 10.30 with the restaurant packed and folk queuing up for a table as we stumbled out into the crowded Soho streets in fine spirits.",

I've been in three different branches by now, including this one twice, and the food is consistently good, the staff unfailingly excellent and the place is invariably buzzing - hardly surprising considering the quality of the product. We were in London for the weekend and misplaced the teenager for the night so repaired to Cote for dinner and a natter. We started with cocktails, Kir for her and G&T for me. My only complaint of the night was that the G&T seemed rather lacking in G. Moving on swiftly, my calamari starter was really good and we shared both this and the olives and divine bread my other half ordered. She followed with a tuna salad which she said was excellent. I took her word for it as tuna and I have an uneasy relationship of which the less said the better. It looked good. The Beef Bourgignon was almost as good as my own specialty dish at home... Sniff ! OK then - it was better. Drat. We accompanied this excellent repast with a smooth bottle of Fleurie which went down a treat although it was so moreish we polished it off half way through the main course. We passed on both dessert and coffee and the bill, including 12.5% 'optional' service charge came to an aesthetically pleasing \u00a388.88. Excellent meal, well presented and efficiently served. We will definitely be back.",

You can't! By the time you read this, I have already moved on. There's nothing you can do about it!I almost always order the same thing. Steak Tartare, and a Tuna Nicoise salad. The Tartare has a little bit too much shallot for my liking, but it's decent. It's kind of got that ketchup taste going on, which is pretty impressive for London, considering there is a perpetual ketchup shortage in the city and the country as a whole. An intentional ketchup shortage, I ought to add. It's not an actual shortage. They just don't want it.The Nicoise is very good, too. Nothing fancy there. It's just good.That's all I can write about that, as my flight from London to Los Angeles is now about to take off. It's been delayed for a while. Damned snow.",

Luckily my amazing colleagues - E and R - were in a similar mindset and off we trotted towards Soho.We stumbled across C\u00f4te quite by accident, but at a tenner for Steak Frites we thought \"why not!\"I had the pork belly which was absolutely beautiful, melt in the mouth & cooked to perfection. The sauce which came with the caramelises apples was almost a dichotomy to the rest of the dish, so bitter that i wasn't entirely sure I liked it but the mash was excellent and complimented that well.E and R both opted for steak, R going for the 10oz rib eye with the garlic butter sauce and E for the steak frites. Both agreed it was the best steak they had ever had.All in, for this plus my cheeky kir royale we were under \u00a345. In the middle of Soho at 8.30pm on a Saturday night that is a pretty amazing deal. I'd definitely go again.",

The ambiance was low key and pleasant and the food was very tasty. We started with some bread and the chicken liver pate which was absolutely delectable. The pork belly was enjoyable with a crispy melt-in-your-mouth skin and came with a side of savory whipped chive potatoes. What I wasn't crazy about was the sauce that came with the dish - the thyme was overwhelming and I found myself pushing the sauce to the side which left the pork a little dry.My boyfriend enjoyed his steak and chips and was full enough to pass on dessert. I decided to order the creme brulee which was disappointing. It was extremely cold and the bruleed sugar on top was burnt. What's worse is that it took FOREVER to come out... we almost decided to cancel and pay the bill by the time it finally came.Service was very friendly but slow... although I have to wonder if that's just my American expectations being too high because every establishment we ate at in the UK had equally slow service without apology.I'd probably come back here for the prix fixe lunch but I don't think I'd pay the regular a la carte prices again.",

I haven't ever had it before and I enjoyed it but I found the duck a bit dry. Other meals were steak frites which were apparently good and my friends raved about the lamb. We didn't have dessert.

And it's had a decent ambience for somewhere chainy: low lights reflecting off mirrors and polished wood, tables not too cramped, casual but darkly elegant in that French brasserie kind of way.But now I think I know why they turn the lights down so low at night. I went there for breakfast on a Saturday morning and I can't say it was anything like the evening experience. For one thing, the place was a bit... well, grubby. Not filthy as such, but certainly not polished, and looking a bit tired, drab, not particularly clean and in need of some attention. \u00a0Also, the fruit flies that were buzzing round in an attempt to share our breakfast brought on an entirely different ambience to what I was expecting.The food was OK. \u00a0Really just OK (French breakfast good, my dining partner didn't enjoy the crepe). \u00a0But it didn't feel OK when I felt a little embarrassed having brought somewhere here on the promise that it was really nice. The service was attentive.This review almost scraped its way to 3 stars, based on my past good experiences and the possibility that they (or the cleaners) were having an off-day. \u00a0But I really need to base this on my last experience. So there's massive room for improvement, C\u00f4te.",

Nobody in our group was feeling necessarily decisive, and we took turns suggesting and dismissing food ideas. Oh, and also, we were drunk. Someone in the group had to pee, so we stopped in a pub and had some more beer. I asked the bartender to suggest a place within stumbling distance that was good, and he pointed us towards C\u00f4te. When we arrived, I thought it would be mediocre, mass-prepared type of food. Like a TGI Friday's of French food or something. The meal was a lot better than I thought it would be. All of our dishes were delicious and well-prepared, the calamari was some of the best I've ever had, the mushroom dishes (namely the poulet grille and mushroom feuillete) were divine. For the price and in that part of town, finding a good food spot that you can get into without booking a table is a nice bonus. It was not ZOMG the best meal ever, but it was solidly delicious and we all felt comfortable and happy. The end.",

Soft jazz, windows make inside seating part of the street. Great people watching \u00a0(though on a Sunday, seems more limited foot traffic)+ Beautiful heavy bottle for water. Never seen this before. Will upload picture. Absolutely loved it.+ Very prompt service.+ Food was excellent. I mean English breakfast is the same everywhere, but there was something about every part of it that tasted fresh and vibrant.+ Cloudy apple juice. Interesting. Refreshing.- Coffee sour but possible that was intended.Mostly the vibe. I could have stayed there for hours. I ended up shazaming a bunch of tracks because I just hoped to slip into the same vibe after returning home by playing a bunch of them.",

My mom and I both ordered a chicken dish with mushroom sauce and it came with potato gratin. The restaurant has a great atmosphere. I came here for lunch on Sunday, and the restaurant was full of people; which was great because who wants to eat in an empty restaurant! The restaurant staff let my mom and I stay at our table for a long time after we were done eating. Love this restaurant!",

Breakfast - Full English (2 eggs, 3 bacon rashers, sausage, tomatoes, mushrooms w/ toast \u00a37.75 w/ juice & coffee drink (called Formula \u00a39.95). Bargain pricing but very high quality & my 2 eggs were cooked exactly as order, poached hard/not runny. My skinny flat white coffee was also perfect, hot & flavorful. I love coffee & drink a ton, so I did have a second one which was also delish. Lunch - Chicken & walnut salad. The chicken was moist & flavorful. My only complaint was the dressing was a little heavy, but I usually ask for it on the side & forgot. Free wifi - ask for the codeFree filtered water - served in a cute bottle. The ambiance was authentic french brasserie & the servers were very friendly - ironically which I don't think is very french :-)",
