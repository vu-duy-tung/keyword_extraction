The seductive, incensed entrance does look creepy/inviting depending on your level of bravery but on sunny days, it's so nice to step out of the bright sunshine into the cool, dark interiorThe food is billed as north African but is a mixture of typical Mediterranean meze type dishes and coucous and tagines. The food is well seasoned and tasty.It is quite a hypnotic place with a lovely ambiance and candle light and you may not want to rejoin the hurly burly going on outside",

    "text": "I'm not that familiar with African/Moroccan food and was very pleasantly surprised to see that I reallllllly enjoy it! We went here for New Years Eve and had their 3 course set menu and had a great time for several reasons:1) Great foodThe 3 course set menu started off with a glass of champagne quickly followed by appetizers for each of us, including (ignore my spelling) lamb kubeeh, chicken briouat, hummous, falafel zaalouk and yoghurt. Then we each selected a different main from the set menu. I ordered the lamb mechoui cous cous (I think it was lamb shoulder) which came with a chick pea sauce for the cous cous. I also got to sample my fellow guests' dishes: the stuffed chicken tagine with halloumi and baked seabass tagine. All delicious!!! We ended our meal with a selection of baklava (a bit too sweet for my taste but the others loved it) and a large espresso. 2) Great serviceThroughout dinner the manager of the restaurant stopped by to ask how our meal was going and we also had very attentive waiters. 3) AmbianceFrom walking through the big wooden doors, you're transported from the cobblestone streets of Covent Garden. The deep red and gold colors run throughout the restaurant, from the walkway from the door to the maitre d stand, and then through the bar area and into another room decorated with big cushions, large wooden tables and soft lighting throughout. It's perfect if you're looking for a different kind of night out. One small note: a couple of my guests were about 6ft tall so they found the chairs at the table a bit too low to be very comfortable but the other ladies and myself were quite cozy on the cushions.After watching the NYE fireworks and doing a bit of bar-hopping aroung Seven Dials, we came back to Souk Medina as the manager had invited us back for a bit of belly dancer entertainment but found that the restaurant was cleaning up. The staff still happily let us in, poured us all complimentary glasses of bubbly, and we all commenced to a short but energetic dance party. Random, yes, but a great way to end the night.Souk Medina showed us a great time and I'd happily return again.",

Issues we (2 ppl) experienced whilst dining here on a Friday night:- sat very close to other diners when restaurant not full- very slow with drinks and took them to the wrong table twice- offered a takeaway container for leftover food then told this was not allowed on Friday (what a waste) we then saw other diners having their food put into takeaway containers- given wrong bill- correct bill did not have taste card discount- reluctant to apply discount- paid in notes and coins and told the waitress to be careful with the coins \u00a0she returned minutes later claiming we were \u00a34 short. We protested. We then saw her picking up coins off the floor around the corner. As we were leaving we were approached by another waitress stating we still owed \u00a32. We refused to pay and left. If they can't find it they can take it off the ridiculous service charge!! Saving grace here is the cool decor/atmosphere Don't expect much else",

Belly dancers entertain as you sip on a cocktail (for \u00a35.95 - not bad) or share a platter of delicious Moroccan cuisine.I've only been for drinks but I definitely want to go back to try their great-looking menu.

The service was prompt and friendly but the food was luke warm at best. The pitas had been re-heated a few times and were exceptionally dry. The food itself lacked flavour and was literally bland. The mint tea was really nice and came in a fancy pot. One final note on the decor - the room way in the back is kinda covered with a dark red cloth as a false ceiling. It creates this unique darkish ambience. It is a nice touch but when you look closely, that cloth is just filthy. Not sure if I would go back ever again! 2 stars coz the tea was nice and the service is prompt and friendly. At this price, I can surely have a better experience.",

    "text": "Dinner at Souk Medina is a completely new dining experience for me (even though I've visited North Africa twice!)The restaurant starts at a narrow hallway and walking a few feet into it the smell of mint tea and fresh food hits you - and on an empty belly can really make you salivate. Apart from the smell of food also walk into a North African oasis - it's really amazing! The atmosphere and food of Souk Medina is really traditional - d\u00e9cor is exclusively Moroccan, warm/soft lighting, Arabesque music in the background, beautiful food - it really brings an authentic Morocco feel to anyone who visits. Although being in the heart of London this place will take you far-away.On the main level it was quite busy with people sitting and people at the bar. We were seated though having a slightly large group - beware the tables for starters is quite small and having plates on your lap is advised! The starters were good; hommous, stuffed vine leaves and batata harra (spicy potatoes) - all very yum. After starters you are taken to the top level overlooking the bottom level. Seats are comfy if you're lucky enough to get on the couch seats otherwise you'll be on chairs. The mains were amazing especially the fruity lamb tangine. So so good -for this alone I would go back. Cous cous was nice and I usually do not like cous cous. Service was probably one of the best I've had in London - very patient and helpful - plus with a big group we were somewhat annoying I have to admit hehe and they remained patient and attentive. Desserts were nice - baklava and mint tea. Baklava is not as sticky and sweet as the Turkish kind so I enjoyed it very much. But at the end of the meal I couldn't think about having more than one. The price range is roughly \u00a330 per person including service charge and drinks. Ooh, one thing I didn't like about Souk Medina was the small cocktails! At around \u00a37 you get a tumbler full of ice and a small amount of the good stuff. Although it was tasty I wish there was a bit more in there for me to enjoy. This is my first time going to a Moroccan restaurant and I was not disappointed. Recommended for a once in a while/special occasion dinner.Oh and did I mention there was a belly dancer? A lot of fun !",

    "text": "Visted Souk Medina on a hen night weekend with a group of 8 or 9 others, found the tables too short to sit comfortably at (ended up with backache for several days afterwards). The lighting was so dark that I couldn't read any of the menus; food or drink. The set menu at \u00a319.95 was way below average quality, I found myself happy that I'd eaten enough of the humous and pitta bread for starter so as not to be left starving. Of the main course the lamb was so over-cooked it was falling to pieces and so soggy that the prunes the lamb was cooked with were being mistaken by all of us for pieces of lamb, never mind that the rest of this dish consisted of apricots. The rest of the main course dishes were barely edible, the couscous was like mashed potatoes, everything else was dripping with oil, the item in vine leaves was probably the nicest thing on offer except there were enough pieces there for just one for each of us... Too many of the dishes were laced with fruit which really didn't appeal to me. The service was decent enough but not worth them adding 12% to the bill automatically, especially for the standard of food. Oh yes, there was also a belly dancer who appeared near our table for 2 minutes or so. Eating at Souk Medina was an experience all right but not one that I plan to repeat. If you like North African cuisine this might suit you but beware, it's almost impossible to have dinner conversation as the \"authentic\" music is just too loud and if you're taller than 5'4 you might find it very difficult to get comfy at any of the tables!",

To the point that plates didnt fit on the table & some of us ate on our laps! I don't know if this was the restaurants fault, or if our group was booked as 2 seperate bookings that wanted to sit together. They didnt have a larger table available though. The atmosphere is very dark, Moroccan & reminds me of an actual souk. It certainly didnt feel like central London after stepping inside. We opted with a set menu for 3/4 of the group & some grilled mains- which worked out ample. The falafel & homous was tasty & the cous cous so light & fluffy. The grilled meats were delicious too. This was followed by baklava & mint tea. The music was ramped up & a belly dancer came around all the tables. A few laughs for a few minutes, but otherwise I wouldnt have minded if she wasnt there. The thing that made our night was the waitress. An Italian girl that was so funny, accomodating & friendly. If she had been dull & boring, I'd give it 3 stars. Food & drinks were prompt & the order was spot on. I'd go again, but would be checking we could actually all fit on the table.",

The Souk Medina is very cosily decorated - I really loved all the intimate compartments and the North African style furniture, every time I go to a place like that I just wonder why us Europeans sit at high and uncomfortable tables! Isn't it so much nicer to be surrounded by the comfort of cushions? - So the ambiente was a great plus. The food was good too, although my Algerian friend thought it was too expensive for what they offered. Personally, I didn't agree, it was great food - the couscous was especially fluffy and light and tasted wonderfully sweet (it was served with raisins, something I had never tried before but having a sweet tooth, I instantly liked it!), and the chicken was heavenly spiced. The lamb was a bit dry, but also expertly spiced. The pita bread was maybe also a bit hard, but the various sauces and the wine leavesoh the wine leaves! They were delicious.The only big, big drawback was that it got really hot in there, and really really crowded. I was sitting on a pile of two leather cushions and found it very hard to move them (as they would simply fall over one another) - and there were people all around me. But altogether - very nice place for a slightly exotic dinner!",

The atmosphere is really cool (dark, cozy, low tables, cushions, curtains), and the space seems to go on forever with a main level, an upstairs hideaway, and an entire lower level (where we sat). We started off with some delicious cocktails, some type of mojito with rose and something with brown sugar, plus a whiskey sour, all of which were delicious. For food, 2 of us got the set menu, while the third got an entree (duck with cinnamon). The set menu is excellent and quite a deal, everything we had was delicious and there was a great bit of variety and sooooo much food (we couldn't finish half of it). It seemed to just keep coming... hummus and hot pita, grape leaves, chickpeas and spinach, couscous, chickpea sauce, spicy potatoes, chicken and lamb with prunes, baklava, mint tea... I was loving every bite and cursing the fact that we don't have anything similar in Boston (set menus = awesome value + awesome variety). My dining companions were similarly pleased with everything.Definitely recommended for good food at a good value, for a change of pace or special occasion (this would be great for a date!).",

Especially the downstairs and corner sitting areas scream 'MOROCCAN!'. So yeah, very authentically looking place, delicious cocktails (at least the non-alcoholic ones I tried), fresh mint tea, great service. In terms of the menu both, the selection and presentation are very traditional. I would recommend ALL their starters, including grilled haloumi, and hummus and as a main I cannot adore enough lamb stone dish. So tender, proper slow cook meal with veg, filling, comforting, making smile on ones face. Yet, the portions are very good size.On the other hand, you can go really wrong if you feel like experiment. I tried moroccan pasta (shaped as tiny little balls) in a tomato sauce of sort, the meal didn't talk to me or make sense - the texture or anything hooked me in. Dessert = baklawa could use at least tiny little innovation, but with lunch menu of 2 courses (big main course, peppermint tea, baklawa) for \u00a312 or so who could say a word. Besides, as stated above - this place's charm is authenticity and tradition...",

    "text": "Ahhh, Souk Medina. I've been back on innumerable occasions so they must be doing something right. This is a Taste London restaurant - 50% off the food (except Fridays and Saturdays) and you don't have to call and book, which already scores a few brownie points. Without the discount it's still reasonably priced - \u00a37 or so for cocktails, wines starting at about \u00a316 a bottle, the set menu at \u00a320 a head.I've had the set menu a few times - the potato starter and the lamb tagine are amazing, but the rest is a bit 'eh'. Once the waiter recommended ordering the set menu for half the table and choosing other dishes from the a la carte to get more variety - a good choice. The tables are LOW, and if you're in the downstairs lounge sometimes you'll end up with a big birthday group (at which point they'll play this crazy 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOOOOUUU' song which is great if you're the birthday table, not so great otherwise). So my recommendation is to sit upstairs as the idiots do seem to congregate in the lounge.But I'm bitching about a place that otherwise I really like - a nice little oasis off Covent Garden that's well worth a visit.",

We had wine with our meals and these were a bit pricy, but I guess only what you expect in London. The food was warm but lacked depth in flavour. The Chicken tagine seemed a bit bland and the Lamb had fatty bits, not what you want. Not the best north African food I've ever had but okay! The surroundings where very traditional and they'd made an effort to make the atmosphere good with a resident belly dancer etc.... Nevertheless I expected a bit more from the food and it really seemed to be a bit 'all fur coat' and well.... you know what!",

    "text": "Great are the perils of harbouring mighty expectations! Disappointment is but guaranteed. Anticipation is the death of all goodness in restaurants, I deem hereforth.Alright, enough with wielding my poetic licence then.I had been looking forward to checking out the Souk Medina for the longest of times. On several occasions, I had lovingly browsed through their well-done website and planned and plotted on what I would like to savour when I'm there (yes, I can be quite pathetic like that, sometimes :P) but several plans at the venue fell through, much to my consternation.I /finally/ made it to the venue quite unexpectedly at an acquaintance's birthday do, without much of an appetite to speak of. I would have preferred to just have a quick drink and dash, and come back for a proper meal to savour the much-promised goodness of their menu. But the seating arrangement is such that to seat yourself, you have to inconvenience everyone and sidle up the edges and I decided to be polite and have a quick bite. However, the way the set menus work is thus - if everyone orders the set menu, there is a free flow of food to the table, but if people hmm and haw and go for ala carte, the table might face impositions on the free flow. Call it peer pressure or whatever you will, I ordered the set menu after all. It might have been that I felt a degree of coercion or that I didn't have much of an appetite. Or it could have been the brisk treatment by the waiter who did not seem keen to elucidate the various options available to guests. But I wasn't pleased. The food was probably not bad at all, but it didn't overwhelm me positively enough for me to overlook the general lackadaisical service. The only thing that stands out in my mind from that meal was this succulent lamb dish flavoured with whole plums - I liked, despite the grouchy mood I'd fallen into.For the moment, I shall reserve my judgment on the food and rate this place on the service which deserves no more than the 2 measly stars I shall spare.",

The interior was amazing, and the atmosphere was really chill, exotic, and laid back - so my first impressions were good. And then they brought out the Casablanca beer, and I was head-over-heels in love with this place. The beer, plus a delicious Mezze platter and a plate of grilled holoumi later, and I wanted to propose. At this point I was already full and ready for a nap, but I soldiered on and had the chicken, feta and spinach Tangine for my main and GOOD LORD was it good. I'm kind of a wuss and usually shy away from any meal where the meat is still attached to the bone (*shudder*) but the way the meat was cooked caused it to be so tender that it literally fell of the bone when touched. It was, needless to say, delicious. This place has excellent cocktails, food, and atmosphere, so it's the perfect place for a big group party, or a quiet date for two. Plus, the staff are incredibly knowledgeable and can know the menu like the back of their hand and will recommend something if you're stuck, or unfamiliar with the food on the menu.",

Having wondered past a few times I insisted that we check it out for my friend's birthday. thankfully it didn't disappoint. Upon arrival you are greeted by attractive staff. I know this is shallow, but the woman and the guy that welcomed us were both smoking hot. Immediately I knew I was going to enjoy this place. We were led downstairs into a dimly lit parlour area. It was like a Moroccan dream. Like I had stepped onto the set of Aladdin, sans magic carpets. I was already aware of the what the score was, but for your information I shall divulge details. For 30 of your English pounds you will receive starters consisting of hummus, pita bread and a spicy sausage and potato thing which they will keep bringing to your table until you bleed. Once you decide that you've had enough they will then bring out the main courses. The two main ones you should concern yourself with are the slow cooked beef and chicken. Both are let in the mouth unreal. Eat and then eat some more. The food won't stop coming until you beg for them to stop. If you're hungry you can really get your fill. During the course of the evening you will also be treated to a belly dance. I found it a little awkward. Don't ask me why. I guess it's a sort of weird lapdance. However, a bottle of wine each (this is covered in the 30 nuggets) and some delicious, super buttery baklawa and you'll be living the dream. Need an excuse to got into the tourist nightmare that is Covent Garden? You've found it. \u00a0Sexy Rob",

I've heard it can be really busy on the weekends but we booked in during the week and although the waiters still seemed rushed I kind of liked the hustle and bustle, as it did very much feel like a Medina. Having spent a number of months in Morocco I can tell you that the decoration and the caves lent themselves very well to feeling like you'd been transported to the middle of Fez! I love the low lighting, cushions and hanging lamps.The food too was a lot better than I had expected. There are of course a whole range of delicious tagines as well as other meat and fish dishes such as Lamb cutlets and Seabass. The spices appear to have been mixed to perfection but be warned - Moroccan cuisine is about subtle flavours not burn-your-mouth-off flavours so if you want a real curry then perhaps you'll be disappointed. Everything was wonderfully presented - make sure you order a mint tea with baklava for dessert, they'll bring it to you on the traditional embellished tray.",

I always recommend this place to friends visiting London as well, it's a little hidden Gem. Entering through a curtain doorway down a small alley way you would think you were in Morrocco, the decor is down to a T from floor to ceiling and with wooden carvings, dark wood tables and the aroma of spiced food and mint tea. It's on two floors and always busy in the evenings so best to book a table. I always order the Mezze or a type of stew or if I'm with friends we order the set menu and there's always plenty of food to go round. The Moroccan tea and cocktails also worth a try. On most Saturday evenings there is a belly dancer downstairs so always good fun. Although I don't smoke shisha I believe there is a room for this Worth a visit if your in Covent Garden",

We turned up to find they were closed for lunch, despite making a booking there. Never fear, we were sent to their other restaurant 'Souk Medina' which was about 5 minutes walk away. I'm so glad we did because I had the best lunch ever.We opted for a lot of tapas style dishes and just shared everything. All the food was amazing, from calamari, humous to little soft cheese and feta parcels. The best, however, was the aubergine dip. So much so, we ordered a second! We noticed others around us smoking shish, so after our meal, we asked to move to the comfy sofas to have one as well. We created own flavour we named 'Grint' - grape and mint! The pipe was electronic, like vaper cigarettes. Above all, I'd like to say a special thank you to our waitress, Laura, who made our meal so enjoyable! Her service was phenomenal! We were laughing the whole way through. So thank you! And we will be back next Christmas!",

Stepping into this restaurant feels like entering an exotic maze as there is noone beckoning you in or ushering you to a seat but instead there are many nooks and crannies in which you can lounge at leisure and many exits or entrances to escape or emerge from.\u00a0The food is wholesome; pleasant to look at and satisfying to eat. However, although there is a good variety of ingredients, the overall flavour was surprisingly lack-lustre (not absent but not quite igniting the taste buds as you might expect from Moroccan cuisine). Nevertheless, Souk Medina serves up a hearty meal amongst an atmospheric cove in the heart of London.",

Now that I'm writing this, it makes me want to go back for a do over and try the couscous and vegetables. It's hard for me to imagine root vegetables could go wrong.If I had to do it all over again, I would just come for tea and company. Super colorful and cozy place with very skilled and warm belly dancer.At some points the music was too loud for conversation, which I always find annoying because I'm not the best at shouting.A pleasant experience nonetheless.

We stumbled upon it when trying to find somewhere to eat after a yelp event and brilliantly, they accept tastecard.Because we got 50% off, we took full advantage of the more expensive A la carte menu. Ordering 3 meat dishes and a vegetarian one - just for some variety as we were sharing anyway. My favourite way to eat. They also said, we could ask for more meat if we desired, but we were all totally stuffed!Sweet mint tea and baklava to finish off was a lovely treat!Really relaxed, comfortable atmosphere, although there were times when I wasn't sure what I was eating because of how dark it was.Midweek meal with a tastecard, doesn't get much better.",

    "text": "Located in Seven Dials this is a hidden gem in tourist central.We only came across it when looking at nearby restaurants where we could use a tastecard. The entrance is quite small and you could easily walk past and not be impressed by the look of the restaurant.It's deceptive though, as the place is pretty large inside, with an upstairs dining area too. We opted for one of their meal deal type menus. \u00a325 each for starters, all you can eat meat mains and an array of baklava for dessert washed down with sweet mint tea.I wouldn't pay the full \u00a325 to eat here but with 50% with a tastecard it made it a worthwhile deal.Starters included pitta, dips, falafel and vine leaves.Mains were lamb tagine, a slow cooked chicken (on the bone) dish, a chickpea dish and we also opted for a veggie moussaka. The chicken was delicious and fell off the bone and the lamb was tasty too. Perhaps a little bit too salty (and I like salt!) but still very nice.We thought we'd take advantage of the 'order as much meat as you'd like' offer but found we were full and didn't even finish all of our food, let alone order more!It was a fun, easy, very filling, sharing type meal. I enjoyed it, especially at a good price but we did find the restaurant so dark that it was hard to read the menus or see the food when it arrived! It came to \u00a315 each inc. service, with no drinks. Not bad at all.",

The #1 reason I have reviewed it as a 5, is the set menu, whichever one you order, you will get an endless supply of the foods, so I had an endless supply of lamb, once I ate it, I was given a new one. This was coupled with the fact, they take Tastecard so I had amazing food, ever lasting at half price. Plus Covent Garden is a lovely area to walk around before and after.",

I popped in for drinks with a group of colleagues and although I was drinking wine I had serious drink-envy of everyone's cocktails. I think it was a Moroccan Mash - a gin and juice combo - that I tried a slurp of... And boy, will I be back for some of those! We didn't eat but we had some pitta and a trio of humus and dips which were delicious, we reordered a few times because it was disappearing quite quickly between the 5 of us! The food looked delicious and people around us seemed to be really enjoying everything about the place. I will be returning soon for a meal!",

    "text": "I went for dinner at Souk Medina about 4 years ago with a big group of friends. It was fun as we sat on the floor on cushions so it seemed more authentic, the food was really tasty and there was a belly dancer providing entertainment. So, when a couple of fellow yelpers asked if my friend and I fancied getting some food somewhere after a yelp event and they found Souk Medina nearby with a taste card offer I was definitely up for going again.It's just off Seven Dials but a bit of a hidden gem. It looks like it's a tiny little place but really cute and full of Moroccan treasures, furnishings and art. It looked pretty empty when we got there but once we were through the entrance it opened up and it was pretty busy. We were seated upstairs and strangely I ended up sitting in the exact place I did 4 years ago. It has changed a little though as it now has tables with benches and chairs rather than cushions on the floor. It's really nicely decorated and does make you feel like you're far from the streets of London but it was a little too dark for my liking. It would have been great to see our food better! We were offered the choice of two set menus and as we were hungry we went for the more expensive one. It would normally be \u00a325 per person but it was 50% off with the taste card.With the set menu, you get all of the starters listed, then you choose vegetarian, meat or fish for the mains and you get all of those. We went for three meats and then a veggie one too. The meal comes out and is shared so you all get a bit of everything. I really love this kind of dining. We were also told that the meat was unlimited so we could ask for a top up at any time - WOW!The starters were houmous, tatziki, falafel, something with lamb, halloumi, stuffed vine leaves and bread. The main was veggie moussaka, lamb in chickpeas, chicken, couscous and more chickpeas. It was all nicely flavoured, although I would have preferred a little more spice, the meat was really tender and when I picked up a bit of chicken it was so good that the meat instantly fell off the bone!We really wanted to order extra meat just because we could but we were really full and couldn't eat any more...until the baklava came out with mint tea that is!The mint tea was very sweet but I like it that way. It might be too sweet for others, especially when combined with the ultra sweet baklava.I'd probably pay \u00a320 for the meal we had, do it really did feel like a bargain when it was \u00a312.50 each with the taste card offer. There was a 12.5% service charge added on top for the full price it should have been so that added a bit but overall I'd highly recommend it.",
