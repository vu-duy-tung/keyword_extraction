So make my way I did, walking around the streets of carnaby on a cold,rainy day during my holiday season trip to London in an attempt to discover for myself this much talked about \"Bombay cafe\" inspired diner. Maybe it was the cold outside, maybe it was the warmth and bustling crowds inside, maybe it was the wonderful hearty black daal or the friendly waiting staff that brought it over, or was it those slow moving ceiling fans that remind one of simpler times... whatever it was, I think I felt better about life post Dishoom!Don't expect life changing experiences, but expect to be pleasantly pleased. The menu is interesting \u00a0... traditional favorites come with an interesting twist or too, like a jackfruit biryani but the black daal has no surprises, no twists just rich, feel so goodness ! In the end, I am glad I experienced Dishoom and I join my half a dozen acquaintances in recommending this to others!",

I was hesitant to come here because I try to avoid touristy restaurants and was worried this was another overpriced tourist trap but my meal was truly wonderful. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the menu doesn't have much variety of Indian food. I was expecting to see goat or lamb curries, or more traditional Indian or Nepali foods, but the menu is mostly vegetarian, paneer, or chicken. And they only have 2 curries. I'd say this is more of a modern, trendy version of Indian food. If you're wanting traditional Indian/Nepali foods with more variety, I would say this isn't the right place for you. Still, I recommend going for the chicken ruby",

I arrived for lunch, just as the crowd poured in. Our waiter gave great recommendations, and our first 2 dishes arrived before we even finished placing our order \u00a0(servers electronically submit dishes). Huge selections of food and drinks. It is recommended that each guest order 2-3 small plates and share with the table. Everything we ordered was amazing... the lamb was the highlight as was the prawn plate.My only complaints were that although there is plenty of seating, they really pack the place tightly. You are sitting very close to other guests and you don't have much table room at all. You feel like you are constantly rushing to finish dishes because you need to make room on the table. The service started out fast, but after our first 2 small dishes, we ended up waiting quite a bit for the rest... but I am going to blame this on the incoming lunch crowd.",

It was late, dark and cold and in Kings Cross With bridges canals etc and I had trouble finding the place! When I entered I was \u00a0pleasantly greeted but advised that the kitchen was closing in 25 minutes - fine. However when I sat down I \u00a0discovered it was part of a (gasp) chain! My expectations descended into near-despair - my last meal in London was going to be a bland affair served on a styrofoam plate!Then my charming approachable lovely waitress (I can't recall her name but she was serving upstairs on January 9). She assured me I would not be disappointed and I grasped that tiny fractal of hope with all my being! I kept it simple with lamb samosas, Chana chaat salad and the chicken biryani and all were absolutely excellent. I think it's \u00a0worth a trip in business class (not coach) from New York to try the rest. Great vibe, great food, great service -wow!",

We were fairly pleased with the fins...Pros:- Super affordable! Especially considering its in a fairly popular, trendy neighborhood. - Delicious food. They serve traditional Indian dishes with a modern spin. - Designed to share. No starters/apps. You order all at once and food comes out as its ready. I enjoyed sampling a little bit of everything our table ordered. Cons:- Disorganized at front of house. We requested a table outside. When the hostess tried to seat us inside, we inquired. The time it took her to check and discover there wasn't an outside table available, we lost our inside table. - All staff (front of house and servers) seemed a little harried. Everyone we encountered was a mix of disinterested, rushed and short. All in all, Dishoom was just above average. I've had better but I've also had much worse Indian food in the UK. If they could button up service, it would bump this spot from 3 to 4-stars in my opinion.",

Even during your wait in line, someone comes by periodically with a choice of chai tea or a shot of sherry. With the nippy weather, either would make a good choice to help you stay warm!Once inside, it was a short wait with the buzzer so we ordered drinks. Bhang Lassi...must order! It's a different take from the usual mango lassi, tho they have that also. For dinner, we went with a variety to share. So among the two of us, we had okra fries (light & crispy with 3 dipping sauces), chicken tikka (not smothered in sauce like we're used to but very tasty & spicy), paneer curry (little heat, very delicious!), and garlic naan (texture was great and garlic wasn't overwhelming). For dessert, we tried their pineapple & black pepper crumble (more crumble than fruit but the warm custard sauce was the cherry on top) and finally, a chocolate chai (great blend of chocolate & chai). The dishes were not huge portions but I've come to learn this could be the norm in London? I was able to do 3 courses as a result which is awesome. Definitely would come back and try other dishes of theirs.",

Since it was so cold to stand outside, we were served hot tea. After 45 minutes of wait, we were allowed in and the it was very cosy. The food was simply worth the wait. We ordered Keema Pau, Sali Boti, Roomali Roti, Black Daal and Chicken Ruby. It was simply good food and we all loved it compared to what we had earlier.

There was a chicken dish -- I can't remember the name, but it's basically the best chicken tikka masala ever. We had a couple different chana (chickpea) dishes, which were awesome. They have a unique and awesome take on an old fashioned. And there's even a kids menu -- which you don't often find at an Indian restaurant (and it's delicious too). Everything was the perfect amount of spicy. I eat a lot of Indian food and this is easily the best ever. I want to cry now because this place is 6,000 or so miles from home. Also, the decor is this awesome 60's shagadelic London-Bangladesh mix. So cool.",

    "text": "EPIC rude service. Like, beyond belief. Could not enjoy our experience at all. Our most expensive meal our entire week in London (smallest amount of food as well) and having to literally beg someone to take our money so we could pay the check and leave really leaves it impossible for me to want to come back here. From start to finish our server hated life, hated us, hated the job and could not be bothered. We sat 25 minutes waiting to have our order taken. Another 20 minutes after ordering we had nothing to drink. No water offered, the wine we ordered was not delivered. Went to the bar, asked the bartender (who was the only bright spot of this entire event) if he knew we ordered a half carafe and if he could just give it to me, since we couldn't find the server. Thankfully he did give it to me. We received our food and never saw our server again. I had to seek out my own fork and own glass of water. The two tables next to us were visibly upset at their lack of service as well. To end an awful lunch, we had to beg for our check and to have our Visa processed. Sorry the food isn't that good for $125USD for 2 people, 1 half carafe of wine, 2 tikka dishes, yogurt and potatoes. Fetch your own water, your own silverware and your own wine. \u00a0What?",

I have tried many different Indian restaurants around the world, and none of them have ever compared and will never compare to a legit restaurant in India. However, Dishoom is the restaurant that has gotten the closest to Indian food reality. Dishoom also has a very accurate attention to detail. Let me explain what I mean--the small details that are present in the food and the restaurant itself prove this careful attention to detail. Food wise, never before have I tasted a beautiful, perfect blend of Indian flavors and spices put into Indian food--it's a fantastic experience. Restaurant wise, the vibe of Dishoom is lively, fun, homey, and most importantly, truly Indian. If one is looking for a lively, exciting new adventurous experience, he or she should come to Dishoom and experience the closest taste to Indian reality.",

The wait only ended up being about 40 mins which was great.Once seated our server was excellent and introduced us to the establishment and provided a ton of recommendations which we took and enjoyed immensely. The black daal (by far my favorite), ruby chicken curry, garlic nan, a bowl of greens, paneer tikka, and a fantastic bottle of Ruinart champagne to top it all off! (Which is my favorite bubbles) The ambiance was romantic, yet fun. The servers were all hustling to the jazzy, Bombay music playing throughout the restaurant. Even my bathroom experience was great! When you walk downstairs to the WC you actually get to walk past the kitchen and can see the chefs doing their thing. It was a delicious, fun, and unique dining experience.

    "text": "All-in-all a good dining experience. Prepare to wait as this is an extremely popular place. Had an hour wait so the wife and I posted up at the bar for a couple of drinks and a little starter which you can order while waiting. Wife had a BollyBellini that was interesting. Not the best bellini I've ever tasted but it was an interesting twist which was nonetheless still very good. We ordered the prawn koliwada which were great. Shrimp were nice and plump, cooked to perfection and the sauce had a real nice punch of heat which I cooled down with a Kingfisher, India's most popular beer.Once seated, about 45-minutes later, we ordered the chicken ruby, the chef special sali boti and the spicy lamb chops. Of course we got some garlic na'an on the side to dip in all the delicious gravies. The chicken ruby was spot on. Just the right amount of sweetness and heat. The chicken could be cut with a spoon it was so tender. Probably my favorite dish of our order.The sali boti definitely had some kick (spicy) and came with a side of the roomali roti which was paper thin. The lamb in the dish was similar to the chicken ruby, so tender! I used the roti to basically wipe the dish completely clean. Very very tasty!What prevented the fifth star was the lamb chop. While the flavor was still there and the marinade was delicious, the lamb was just not cooked that well. It was medium well, boarding on well. Lots of grey inside the meat when I cut into the center and not nearly enough pink and definitely no red at all. After having perfectly cooked lamb the previous night at The Ninth, this was very apparent. If they had nailed the cook this could've been a 5-star experience for sure.Service was great. Ambience was bumpin. Price point was fair! Definitely recommend this place.",

Hands down, always a solid meal.There is good reason there can be an hour + wait but they have a system to get you to the bar for a drink whilst you wait and even bring out drinks to people in the queue.The food is the reason people will wait but I also love the atmosphere! Old world India meets British flair. They keep the theme in the menu with excellent craft cocktails and dishes. There is mood lighting, some low seats and traditional tables. Service is fast and friendly.My favourite dishes are the okra fries (always), lamb biryani, chicken tikka, mattar paneer, garlic naan, chicken ruby and any assortment of the dips. I dare you to find anything you don't like or that isn't packed with flavour. Dishoom is the reason people say London has the best Indian cuisine out of India.",

    "text": "Dinner at Dishoom was easily my favorite meal in London! From the creative and well-priced cocktails during our wait to the plethora of delicious dishes that had us adding on to our order up until the kitchen closed, everything was so well executed and accompanied by attentive and effusively friendly service. I would have tried to come back for another dinner before we left but I didn't want to mar the great first impression.Started with a round of Bombay-style drinks from the bartender's recommendations: Thumbs Up Flip, East India Gimlet, and Sonia's Negroni, and they were all extremely strong and under $10 with pretty presentation. Late on a weeknight, there was still a reasonable (and accurate) 20 minute wait for a table, despite the spacious dining area. Reservations recommended.We moved to our table and met our server, whose name unfortunately escapes me because she was so helpful in making suggestions and ensuring we had the best experience! Our group generally has eyes bigger than our stomachs and she helped to ensure we made the best choices: the Sali Boti Chef's special is a must-get platter of tender lamb and flavorsome gravy topped with potato chips and served with roti, go big with the full order because it's just that good! They also feature their house black daal, which was a smooth and rich side that paired well with everything. The Prawn Koliwada more than lived up to their name with a plentiful portion despite the petite price and the smoky Gunpowder Potatoes I initially dismissed ended up being one of the highlights of our meal! Standard staples of garlic naan and steamed basmati were fragrant, but almost made me wish we'd saved the room for more of their unique dishes like the street food small plates and grilled lamb chops.",

It was my first time trying chicken ruby and it was pretty good! Slightly sweet and a little spicy. The garlic naan was kind of small but overall the food was decent.Service was great and everyone was really friendly.",

We ordered the fried calamari and lamb special and murgh malai (chicken thigh) with garlic and plain naan. The fried calamari was quite special with a kind of sweet and sour sauce. Lamb curry was pretty average. Chicken was tender and better than expected. The naan was however, quite disappointing. It was overcooked which made it crispy. The more disappointing part is that all of the naan and the roti that came with the lamb curry was all lukewarm and not hot. Feels like they have been out for 15 min or so. All in all food was ok, price was reasonable, attentive server and food came on quickly too, but definitely would not queue two hours for it like many have. We went during lunch on sunday without booking for 3 people, and only had to wait for 10 minutes.",

Since the line waiting outside was significantly shorter we decided to put our names down. We were able to get inside and just chill at the bar there. We finally got seated at a small round table, but not the most convenient area. It was where the bus boys and waiters would cash out checks. We tried the chicken tikka, garlic naan, lamb briyani, and paneer tikka. Overall, food was really good and the price wasn't too bad.",

We also had the Bau Bhaji, Dishoom Calamari, Paneer Tikka and Chicken Ruby with a few sides of naan. Everything was perfect but my favorite was the calamari -- cooked perfectly, didn't even have room for dessert :(Service: 4.5 - Quite slow but I was pretty sure our server was training and we also had nice drinks to hold us over so it was alright. Otherwise the manager (?) made his rounds and asked us how we were doing which is always nice. Overall: 4.8 - Highly recommended. Very cool part of London - heard the breakfast was amazing as well.",

I told him we were leaving in the morning and would be sure to visit again for their breakfast. \u00a0After we spoke he came by our table again and offered us 2 free vouchers for breakfast! \u00a0So lovely! \u00a0On top of that...I asked him about the nice smell in the restaurant and was curious what kind of incense they were burning. \u00a0He told me he would find out...he arrived at our table with an entire box of incense and gave it to me as a gift! \u00a0SO LOVELY!!! \u00a0I was genuinely moved by his generosity and for going out of his way to make us feel so welcome. Dishoom's atmosphere is vibrant, cool and comfortable. \u00a0The open kitchen downstairs invites guests to view the energy and skills that go in to the food and adds an element of excitement to the dining experience. \u00a0The back rooms of Dishoom are stunning. \u00a0The fireplace and couches are the focal point of the area and give off a \"cafe\" feeling of ease, comfort and community.I do not know when my next trip to London will be....but I do know that Dishoom will be a part of it.",

The vegetable samosas tasted like something from the frozen microwave section at the grocery store. They were not crispy at all and tasted reheated. The garlic naan was fine but very small portions. Given the reputation from other reviews I expected much more, especially given the price.",

The gold and brown d\u00e9cor and the lounge feel they have carefully constructed makes for a really nice cool atmosphere. While there are a lot of tables you never feel closed in or claustrophobic and the music is pretty good there too. We went shortly after it had officially launched, around 6pm on a Saturday and were lucky enough to get a table right away. When we left around 7:30pm the queues were massive so please keep this in mind if you want to go there for dinner. They will allow you to book tables for parties of 6+ but anything less than that then you might be in for a wait. The bar is good and the cocktails they serve are delicious but this is definitely not the place to come if you're in a rush. We definitely ordered too much food but they were lovely enough to pack some of the things we had left into takeaway containers for us. I would especially recommend the chicken ruby curry, the cheese naan and also the biriyani. All of the food we had was delicious, the only thing I wasn't too fussed on was the daal but that might just be my personal taste. Service wise it's a bit of a mixed bag as while everyone is very professional and friendly, they are always really busy so getting your bill, paying the bill etc can sometimes take a little while. If you're not in a rush then this wont be a problem but can get a little annoying if you have places to go afterwards. If I could eat here everyday then I would as price wise it's reasonable and the food is consistently delicious.",

After all, it's one of London's top rated cuisines and had seen Dishoom recommended multiple times.I had the Pau Bhaji, Black House Daal, Roomali Roti, and House Chai. These are all house and signature specials and rightfully so. The Pau is buttered like my mom would and the bhaji makes my mouth water thinking about it. The black house daal is so savory and perfectly paired with the handkerchief thin roti. House Chai was perfect as well as I'm someone that usually scoffs at people who think they've had chai... This place warmed my heart and brought back some great travel and home memories. The only reason for the lack of 5 stars is that I was seated in the underground room and came alone, so the ambiance was lacking for me.",

It gets really crowded on weekdays for lunch. I ordered naan and the red curry. The food was INCREDIBLE. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "Plenty of reviews already but for anyone who is familiar with the Cheesecake Factory in the US, Dishoom for me is like the Indian restaurant equivalent. Delicious food, consistency, good service and heavily themed restaurants with a queue out of the door.I'm not a fan of waiting around when I'm hungry (it makes me grumpy) but we came for an early dinner and were seated straight away. Previously we queued for the Covent Garden branch when it first opened and attempted to go to the Shoreditch branch but decided against after the woman at the desk gave us a withering look and told us it would be a two hour wait.You know it's a heavily tourist visited place when the waiter starts to explain to us what a samosa is. Yes, we know already thanks, as does anyone who lives in the UK.Overall a good reco. You could probably choose anything on the finely tuned menu. Nothing scary or too spicy or weird so it's very safe but very satisfying and the prices are reasonable.The interior is great too with a retro themed vibe and nice casual, bustling feel.",

Had their take on an Old Fashioned while I waited, and it was killer - partially due to the bay leaf/green tea reduction they mix in. Once seated, service was excellent and shockingly fast considering how busy they were. After ordering, I couldn't have waited more than 12-15 minutes for my food. I ordered the chicken tikka, which was very different than the traditional chicken tikka masala (and the menu was clear on this point). It was a dry seasoning rather than a sauce, a bit spicier. Still very good, though I thought the portions were a bit light for the price. I didn't fall in love with this place, but I enjoyed my food.",

She was so pleasant to converse with and it made traveling alone for business feel a lot more like a vacation.As for the food... you really can't go wrong. I made it here for brunch on a Friday morning, as well as dinner on 3 other occasions. The Murgh Malai and the Lamb Boti Kabab came as recommendations by the service staff. Fantastic. So perfectly seasoned and cooked to the perfect tenderness.I would go back here in a heartbeat.",

They're expanding at a fair pace right now, and it's impressive to see the quality is just as high in their newer spots. Came here with some Yelpers for a brunch treat and ordered a fair amount of food between us. Everything was top-notch and I was particularly impressed with the naan and cheesy toast. None of the flavours are overwhelming and the chocolate chai is yummy - though it could be more chocolatey for my taste! Friendly staff, comfy booths and a stellar location.

    "text": "During a 20 min wait outside the restaurant, we were offered a cup of hot masala chai ( and Sherry). The lady outside the front door was completely rude and lacked the basic ethos of customer empathy. \u00a0We understand that the \u00a0restaurant has created and maintains a buzz but they need to be aware at the end of the day they need to treat their customers right. The wait is quite stretched, still lesser than the branch at Convent Garden. After entering we were informed since we were \u00a0initially advised a 45 min wait and we had waited for only 20 mins we would have to wait for the remaining 25 mins and were given a buzzer and shown the bar. Apart from the above, it was an overall nice experience.We ordered two cocktails the Bombay Manhattan and the Old Viceroy's and a mocktail called the Kala Kattah Sharbat. The drinks were nice and the bartender was extremely friendly and chatty. I must say the cocktails were pricey approximately \u00a310/drink.After about 25 mins we were escorted to our table. And we ordered Bhel, Prawn koliwada, Channa Batura, Spicy Lamb Chops (which was very greasy and fatty), Paneer Tikka, Awadhi Lamb Biryani (which had a slight sweetness and not a lot of flavour of the spices) and Vada Pav. The food was good. This was the first time I have ever been served biryani without any accomplishments like raita (a yogurt dish with tomatoes and onions) or gravy. Lack of it left the biryani feeling very dry. As we left the restaurant around 9pm the crowd reduced and there was hardly any waiting time. So if you want to eat here and do not want to wait in a long queue either get there before 6pm or after 9pm. I personally prefer their Kings Cross Branch.",

Luckily, this restaurant has ample bar space so we were out of the cold & able to grab drinks within 5-10 minutes. Their Bombay colada is really good but super low alcohol. They have a Dishoom IPA in bottles, very hoppy but delicious & worth a try. No draft beers, is this a london thing?For Appetizers: Okra fries- do it if you're a fan but they're just like any other okra fries. Nothing to write home about. Skip the samosas - they're just average. This location's special was the Sali Boti - a lamb curry - it's really flavorful and good. The dhal is really, really excellent. I'm not a huge dhal fan but I wanted to lick the bowl clean. Definitely order it.We also had the Chicken Ruby which is your basic butter chicken - absolutely to die for!Get the roti over the naan - you can get naan anywhere, the roti is super soft & just good. I wish I had got the roti'sNot many great dessert options so we skipped it.Service throughout is great from the host staff whom are friendly, the bartenders whom are lively & the waiters who are hard pressed for time but don't rush you when you are dining. Rule of thumb - indian food is simply just better in England so you can't fail.",

This place prides itself in having original Indian food but concentrates on the grilled variety, with fresh ingredients delicious and great drinks!The atmosphere is something that I really love because it is light, quite modern but very cozy. I have to say it is a nice change from the typical 'tacky' decor of many Indian restaurants. The music is really good as well, and you are able to buy the CD! The service is great and the staff friendly, but since you cannot reserve a table, there is usually a huge line in the evenings especially on the weekends so be prepared to wait a while- but they care for you so much that they offer you Indian lemonade while you wait! Definetly recommend the gunpowder potatoes!",

They should just serve that as a main. It's a thick saucey' type of vegetable curry with a hint of lemon which you dip the soft bread into. Their biryani is gorgeous. They can serve up mocktails for all Muslims even though it's not on the menu and considering the foods halal.

Back in the day, post colonial India and especially in Bombay, Iranian immigrants to India would setup and run these cafes with amazing food and atmosphere. Dishoom Covent Garden is throw-back to this. The Carnaby St. one is a more chic. I think the food is quite good and a moddish take on Indian staples not found in most Indian restaurants, and is reasonably priced. Would highly recommend this.Get the bun-maska with masala chai. Its the best version of bread, butter and tea on this planet.And if you are a foodie, watch this video on Irani Cafes for a nostalgic trip down memory laneyoutube.com/watch?v=QxQE\u2026",

    "text": "I've been here twice with groups of friends in the last month, so here are my thoughts: Yes, you have to wait, but you can wait in the bar area, which has a good vibe. In fact, the vibe in the whole place is just great and the atmosphere put me in a great mood!Food was, for the most part, excellent. I was somewhat skeptical before our first visit because oftentimes, buzzy restaurants over-promise and under-deliver. Not the case with Dishoom. My favorite dishes were the black lentils and masala prawns, and the pau bhaji as a starter. The chicken ruby was also a big hit with our group, although not my thing as \u00a0much. Everyone loved the gunpowder potatoes as well. This is a place where you really want to get a bunch of dishes and share among the group.The reason I'm giving Dishoom four stars, not five, is because (and this is controversial), I wasn't wild about the cocktails. I had a Cyrus Irani and a Kalamansi Smash, and both were too sweet for my taste and just not that exciting. They were not gross, and not so bad as to wreck the experience, but I just didn't love either of them. But our friends did like their cocktails, so it's probably just a question of personal taste. However, I did love the espresso I had after dinner the one time, and the chai I had after lunch the other time. Once we were seated, and at the bar, service was great, especially given how packed the place is. Overall, highly recommended.",

I love being again to try multiple items at once! There was a wait when we got there. You started in the outside like where they give you warm drinks to keep warm and when they have room inside they move you in and give you a buzzer where you can access the bar. We got drinks and the okra fries while we waited. Those fries are like crack, and they come with 3 types of sauce which were all delicious. The lamb skewer and the curry chicken are a must try!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were looking for good Indian while visiting London, and definitely found it in Dishoom. I will warn potential patrons that this place is POPULAR. The first night we tried to eat here, we arrived at around 6:30pm on a Sunday, and there was an hour and forty-five minute wait. We ate next door, and decided to try again the next night. On Monday we arrived at 5pm, and were seated right away.The atmosphere of the restaurant was very unique, and meant to recreate the vibe of an old style Bombay cafe. The menu is meant to be eaten family style, so we ordered a number of different dishes to share. My boyfriend also tried their Chai tea which he said was top notch! We ordered the Dishoom calamari to start which came lightly fried with a very interesting sweet/spicy sauce. It was delicious; could have ordered two servings. Then we also ordered the chicken ruby, lamb biryani, house black daal, and garlic naan. We liked everything except the daal. It had an odd, milky taste, and didn't live up to our expectations of a daal. Every daal we'd ever had before that had been looser with a strong ginger flavor. Honestly, there is something for everyone here. It's fun to try all of the different dishes, and the prices are very reasonable.",

What!) and just soaked in the ambiance (they do a pretty great job with it).We were actually seated in 20 minutes- love when they wait is shorter than promised. Our server was really friendly and super helpful.We ordered murgh malai, chicken tikka, daal and this pretty interesting irani \u00a0style lamb curry (i'm forgetting the name). While everything was delicious, I actually think their murgh malai was the star of the show. It was perfectly seasoned, melted in your mouth and had the perfect texture and flavor. It reminded me of the kebabs we get back in Calcutta! \u00a0I wish i was hungrier, or we came in a bigger group so I could try more things! Will definitely come back.",

I've been to this location twice after feeling defeated at the Covent Garden and Shoreditch locations.The garlic naan is a MUST. Nice hot freshly made with a bit of a crisp on outer edges and not too garlic-y.Chai Tea was delicious! Just sweet enough for me (I like sweet).Chicken Berry Britannia biryani was AMAZING! I normally don't like to eat rice but it was soo full of flavour. There was also a hint of sweetness and a bit spicy.Chicken Ruby was sooo rich and good! Creamy sweet and mild spicy sauce with the most tender chicken. This goes perfectly with the Garlic Naan.",

SO is booking a 1/2 day at work just so you don't have to queue in the cold!! *Just a thought*We were actually sat earlier than our reservation at this Dishoom.

We were given a complimentary prosecco and talked through the menu.The waitress was incredible.. She even handled the fact that I was trying to crack unfunny jokes due to the hunger delirium that had set in.I thought we may have over ordered due to the excitement but I feel like you can never over order. THE FOOD IS INDESCRIBABLE! (but I will try).. HEAVEN!! comes to mind. I am used to a cheap and cheerful takeaway and there I am eating like a Mah\u0101r\u0101ja (Googled the word for Indian King). I would have eaten until I exploded it was that good.We ordered:Okra FriesLamb SamosasSali BotiHouse Black Daal (MY FAVOURITE. it was like I was eating silk!!??)Chicken Biryani Garlic Naan...I CAN NOT WAIT TO GO AGAIN!!!Thank you Dishoom.I'll never forget this anniversary.. not cause love is a beautiful thing...

The queue was LONG, and it was only a Wednesday, and seeing as the restaurant is pretty massive I think it was unnecessary. If you're planning on going arrive at 6pm or 9pm, we got there at 7.45 and waited for over an hour, and once we were in the tables next to us emptied and nobody replaced them, so we obviously came at the wrong time. The food was alright and not too expensive, but the seating is horrible, we were in a part of the restaurant that looked like a living room, it's so hard to eat dhal and biriyani off such low tables. The service was friendly although a little slow, they comped us a round of drinks because our wait was so long. Final point: WHY do they have glass toilet doors? Can people see in? Really weird.",

The hype was enormous - \"best Indian food in my life\" said a well-travelled friend whose opinion I usually trust. I've never voluntarily waited so patiently for so long before for any restaurant in my life, but I was determined to wait placidly for what would surely be the best Indian food ever. What a disappointment. This doesn't rank among the absolute best IMHO. Tried the veg samosas and calamari apps - they're okay. Had the vada pau, garlic naan, roti, mattar paneer, chicken ruby, and chicken biryani. The best was the biryani and roti. Def worth a try, but even that wasn't worth a 2.5 hour wait. Roti was the best roti I've ever had, and Im not a fan of roti but this is exceptional. The rest was okay - chicken ruby is their version of butter chicken. Had better in several places. My grandmother-in-law makes better paneer. Naan was nothing special. I have had better biryani too, but this was good. If I had it to do over again, I would have skipped it. Chocolate pudding was incredible though, but that's not even Indian, and again not worth the wait.",

For food alone I'd rank this place three stars. The other considerations pull this down to two stars. Won't be going back. Before signing off I'll say that our waiter was kind enough to arrange for us to move to a quieter area, and that there was nothing that wasn't tasty.

It is bottomless and the tea has a nice spicy kick to wake you up in the morning. I drank three cups and could have kept going if my stomach wasn't already full. I ordered the bacon egg naan, breakfast lassi, and their akuri dish. The bacon egg naan was good. The naan was light and fluffy and it was interesting eating American breakfast inside a naan. The breakfast lassi had too much banana in it for me. The akuri dish was also a little bland. I also like my food very salty. I wasn't impressed by it, but it was fine to eat. Overall, I don't think it's worth lining for hours for the brunch, but I will have to come back for dinner to round out my review.",

Cooked perfectly with the right amount of spice. \u00a0For the main course we had the black daal, chicken ruby, mixed bowl of greens, naan and rice. \u00a0Everything was outstanding. \u00a0The service was great as well. \u00a0Can see why they have a line out the door each night!",

I wish I could tell you what we ordered, but I don't really know what anything means. I always just fake it and order random items, it worked out! The waiter was very helpful with what we might like. He was right, we loved it all.This place get's packed and the wait is long, but it's well worth it. I was just sad that the portions are not what I'm accustomed with in most Indian restaurants. However, the prices were great, so I can't complain too much. Just be prepared to order a couple of items.",

Okra Fries - YES, there is that fried sliminess that I dig. The seasoning on these fries were so good, and the dipping sauce was even better.We got the garlic naan, Roomali Roti (thin pancake), Sali Boti (lamb dish), Chicken Ruby (their chicken tikka masala).*SPICE ALERT* - If you're sensitive or want a balance to all the spice, highly HIGHLY recommend getting the RAITA. It's a cucumber yoghurt sauce that you can mix with everything \u00a0to cool down the spice; or it's just fucking good anyway.Etch-A-Sketches available if you bring your kids. Not that I have any kids, but I asked for one anyway.......",

It ended up being our favorite dish of the meal with such a rich mixture of flavors and lentils just the tight texture not being too hard or mooshy. 4.5 stars - Vegetable mix: spicy mix of slightly mashed vegetables was another hit. Great to put on the naan. 4 stars- Chicken tikka: nice char on the pieces and moderate spices. 4 stars - Paneer curry: mild curry and firm cheese. 3.5 stars - Sharing style: my favorite at 2-3 plates per person can try many things \u00a0- Atmosphere: bustling with energy for a fun meal with friends.Midlights:- Briyani: strong cinnamon flavor overwhelmed it a bit for me though the dried cranberries were a nice touch. 3 stars - Sparkling cocktail: liked that they had them but a bit too sweetLowlights:- Crowded: have to go super early or else you'll be waiting a long time. We went at 5:30pm and we're lucky to get a table but on the way out it was like trying to get to the front of the stage at a rock concert.Some locals claim it's too trendy and there's better Indian around, but we fully enjoyed it and would come back.",

I arrived around 10:20 am on a Thursday and was surprised to see how many tables were full (some for business and other travelers/tourists). I saw practically everyone in the restaurant with the house chai so figured it was awesome and I'm so glad I ordered it. This was the best chai I've ever had AND there were free refills...say no more. I ordered the akuri (spice scrambled eggs) that came with 2 house buns and a grilled tomato. I also ordered the grilled mushrooms on the side. This was my first experience with an Indian breakfast and I absolutely loved it. The spices (chopped pepper, black pepper, coriander, ginger) really complemented the eggs well. I typically hate ketchup with my eggs but for some reason a little bit went super well with the spiced eggs.Will definitely make this a regular if I travel to London in the future. Would love to try their dinner too. Dishoom - please open up a location in or near NYC :)",

The food, the service, and the vibe were fantastic. The staff went out of its way to answer questions and seemed truly concerned that we were satisfied. After ordering the black daal, a specialty, our server apologetically informed us that the kitchen had run out of the dish. Later the manager stopped to apologize and then offered us a free pudding. However toward the end of our main, she returned with a full serving of the daal. \u00a0\"The kitchen,\" she said, \"made more. You should try it.\" It was delicious, she didn't charge us for the daal--and she still comped our pudding. Yes, we waited 30 minutes like everyone else, but the experience was worth it.

Even those in the team who are lukewarm about Indian food are blown away by the flavours and quality of the dishes on offer here.Dishes to recommend?- Jackfruit Biryani, super interesting and unique- Ruby chicken, classic and amazing sauce- House Dhal, can't go wrong with this, get naan bread to go with itPro Tip: they have a hidden \"feast\" menu, and if you have a group of 5 or more and are feeling hungry or not sure what to order, ask for it. There's three different feast menus, at different price points, and the higher you go the more food you get.",

It truly is something not to be missed if you come for breakfast. Service was as good as we've had anywhere in London. Fast, friendly, and extremely attentive - really set's this place apart. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "This place was packed at 9pm on a weeknight. There was an hour wait, which I was happy to make with the bar being so conveniently close to the waiting area. After a tall beer, I was seated. I ordered the Black Daal, a slow cooked spiced lentil soup. The lentils were well executed, smooth on the palate and soft on the bite. The blend was too spicy and pungent. It lacked complexity and attention to flavor. This became a theme with the meal. The naan was soft and charred. Great execution. I ordered a lamb dish. It's not that this dish was too spicy that turned me away, though it was too spicy. This dish relies entirely on its spicing. The lamb was cooked too far and didn't have tender meat or the savour of lamb fats. It was just a large mound of boiled, then pulled lamb. The lamb tasted as if an entire rack of spices were mixed with it. The mixture was repugnant. Dishoom's spicing is ham-fisted and lacks panache. For someone who loves an intense palate experience, this may be a good choice. If you're looking for adept flavoring, well executed meats, and want to walk away without feeling as if your tongue was dragged through the soot of an ashen battlefield, this is not a good choice. Dishoom is overrated in my opinion.",

    "text": "YUMYUMYUM. Dishoom's been on my radar since it received the honour of being the highest-rated business in the UK on here and I finally managed to convince the bf to come here! He'd been avoiding Indian food after a bad experience he had, but had been slowly getting back round to enjoying it. And he certainly enjoyed it too!We knew we'd probably have to wait for a table as every time we'd passed the restaurant it was busy both inside and outside, but it was totally worth the wait! We got to sit in the bar area with a Kingfisher beer while we waited too, so it didn't even seem like that long at all.The restaurant has a really cool, retro 60s vibe as it was inspired by cafes in Bombay (when it was still known as Bombay) in the 60s. It seems pretty laid back and so, while it could technically be classed as a fine-dining experience, it's definitely not stuffy. The staff were really friendly and knowledgeable when I asked about spice level. Despite the Chicken Ruby sounding seriously awesome, I wimped out and went for the Murgh Malai as it was marked (M) for mild. I have no regrets about this whatsoever though, as the Murgh Malai was amazing. Loads of flavours going on, the chicken was seriously tender and I had to slow myself down eating it cause I was stuffing it in my face! Mr Debs let me try his lamb kebab and it was tasty as well. The basmati rice and roti we shared were a nice accompaniment, the three chutneys we got were tasty as well, although the chilli one was pretty hot! (I tried it as a dare, the spice was punishment for me and Mr Debs' immaturity level and my own idiocy haha.) The mint and coriander chutney was by far my fave!And now for dessert! I ordered the chocolate pudding after being advised by our server that they could swap the chilli ice cream for cinnamon (smart move, Dishoom) and it was lovely. Velvety smooth, indulgently chocolatey and the cinnamon ice cream was fab! I also got to try the bf's strawberry Memsahib's Mess and it was yummy as well - it tasted really fresh and the slight rose flavouring made it a really delicate dish.They're opening in Edinburgh fairly soon and I actually cannot wait!!!",

Upon queuing outside, I drank 3 complimentary chais - happy me! then we waited inside at the bar for some time. The place was very busy and is large. More dinners can be seated in the conservatory.We were shown to our table for 3 and we promptly ordered some starters; prawns, calamari, lamb chops and chicken tikka. The chicken tikka was served luke warm and we informed our waitress whom offered to rectify the situation. We understand that during the soft launch week, there are going to be hiccups, which is why they offer 50% off the food. We also were served the chicken ruby wam and informed the waitress. From then on, the manager wanted to ensure we personally received piping hot food and replaced the chicken ruby for us.We enjoyed some new dishes only available on the Carnaby menu, such at the Chole Bhatura and the Sali Boti. I really enjoyed the Sali Boti as I liked the crunch of the sali crisp-chips with the tender lamb in gravy.We left in a food comma and were unable to find room for dessert. During the soft launch, the take away option is not available (for the obvious reason) The Manager did not charge us for some of the items due to the food not being served hot. This is why I love Dishoom - they always put the customer first and take pride in customer service.",

However, the restaurant is pretty large, and we had only about a 20 minute wait before we were seated. We grabbed some drinks at the bar, where the bartender recommended some great drinks that had an Indian twist to them - saffron, mint, etc. Definitely try them out - even if they sound questionable, Dishoom really knows what they're doing. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant as well - they've done a great job recreating the 1960s Bombay cafes. Theres a cute lil story on the menu - read it! and then read the rest of the menu, because there are SO many delicious options, it'll take a while to pick. A unique dish that I haven't seen at other Indian restaurants was the Roomali Roll, which was great for a light dinner. Full of flavor and spices, I almost wanted another one! I love paneer, and this dish had a nice soft roti wrapping the delicious paneer. Overall, just a great restaurant, and as I write this review, I almost wish I could go back to Dishoom for dinner tonight! Definitely go check it out and eat some great Indian food in London!",

Finally, when walking around Kingly Street in Soho before Christmas, I decided to have a quick dinner at the latest Dishroom restaurant.The place is huge, much bigger than it looks from the outside. The interior is cleverly designed with different rooms with distinct colours and features. Overall, Dishroom Carnaby is a modern, colourful restaurant hat blends a classy style of tables, chairs and couches with modern elements and bit of fun. I was sitting in the room where mirrors mimic windows. I really liked the tone of the light, and the window-mirrors added something oddly comforting \u00a0and weird to the atmosphere. I was warmly welcomed, and then after a very short wait, a lovely girl quickly showed me my table. Staff are really friendly, one waiter in particular was very professional and funny. However, at times there was a bit of a wait until I got the attention of the staff around me. What surprised my was how quickly my food arrived. After a brief conversation with my waiter, I ordered a lamb samosa. It was a palatable parcel that I enhanced slightly in flavour with the various chutneys. Without a question, following my waiter's recommendation was a great start to my dinner.As main, I went for the Carnaby special, Sali Boti. While I am not always the biggest fan of lamb, this dish was a triumph. The meat was tasty and tender, the sauce was a beautifully rich gravy and there were also different textures that made the plate more interesting to eat. The pancake-thin buttered roomali roti bread on the side was perfect to finish off the sauce. I decided to add a rose and cardamom lassi and also a tap water. The lassi was surprisingly nice and great to balance the slightly spicy food.This was a brilliant and delicious dinner, and I did not have to think much about what I wanted, as all the plates and drinks were recommended by the funny and knowledgeable waiter. For dessert, I treated myself go the Dishroom Chocolate Pudding. I must admit, I thought it was an absurdly spicy warm chocolate, but it was also absolutely delicious. The strong chocolate taste in combination with the spicyness confused me a little bit, but I did indulge in it and the ice cream also complemented the chocolate well.To sum it up, my dinner was quick and very tasty. I enjoyed every minute at Dishroom Carnaby, the only detail that did begin to annoy me more and more was the background music...",

The gunpowder potatoes, okra crisps, pav vada, paneer-mango salad, choke bhature are all to DIE for. For the meat eaters, the beri chicken biryani, lamb chops and lamb boti kababs are highly recommended. But their dessert is the best of everything. Start with the rose flavored Memsahibs mess, a delightful rendition of the Eton mess. Also the pineapple-pepper crumble just melts in your mouth. We also had a bowl of the Kashmiri chilli ice cream and it was the perfect end to the meal. This place makes me immensely happy.",

We loved their orange chili sauce! I can't wait to visit London again, and I can't wait to come back to this restaurant!",

We put our names in around 5:45pm on a Saturday and were seated in about an hour. We ordered:- Veg samosas - very small, so great to start. All 3 chutneys were excellent.- Vada pau - Didn't need the bun it was served on, but the potato pancake inside was delicoius- 2 orders of Chicken Ruby - it was so good we got a second order after we were already stuffed! - Chicken tikka - flavorful, tender, juicy. Oustanding.- Sheekh kabab - we originally ordered the lamb boti kabab but the meat was so tough and inedible we had to swap it out. They were very gracious about it. The sheekh kabab was a much better option. - Black house daal - Pretty tasty, but honestly I recommend getting 2 orders of chicken ruby and skipping the daal.- Bowl of greens - literally a small bowl of tasty greens with some sauce so you can pretend to be healthy.- Lamb curry that was served with roti - really good, but again, the chicken ruby was the star.Highly recommend!",

I felt as though I was transported into Mumbai in the 70s, or should I say Bombay...The little ceiling fans, the sepia photos on the wall and the steel tumblers for our water were the type of details that made the whole interior perfect. The menu is unique and they have your standard fare but also more typical bombay snack foods like pav bhaji and chole bhatura which is really exciting. Their romali roti is a must try - light and really a unique treat. The service is wonderful and we had a bit of a wait but the hostess was sweet and even gave us a small glass of chai as we waited.

This is an authentic attempt to replicate the Mumbai cafes, and their bustling environments, with graffiti in Hindi and all, without the ugly water and smog stains. For the Hindi readers, and for English ones, there is plenty of wall entertainment in the form of humor and memorabilia that all will appreciate while you wait, or sip a cocktail. The cocktail menu has done an amazing job of replicating Indian flavors, and even bringing in versions of non-alcoholic Indian street drinks such as Kala-khatta into London, without the associated pathogen borne illnesses typically acquired by Westerners consuming them in India.The menu is creative and does everything from replicate typical Mumbai street food (again without the risk of catching typhoid) to fusion dishes that very cleverly bring out the flavors and tastes of Mumbai.This is a must visit in London for anyone that enjoys Indian food, and anyone who wants to safely immerse themselves into a taste of Mumbai without needed to get all the needed vaccinations and buying a plane ticket! The only downside is that the place is so good, and so utterly popular, that it is at times very hard to get a reservation, and the weekend brunch and evening dinner lines can extend deep into the street. Waiting in them, however, will not yield disappointment!",

I could never comfortably afford eating here on my own budget (let's just say.. last personal trip here, we ate sainsbury's \u00a33 meal combos every day). My very-well-traveled coworker said we need to go to Dishoom. \"Best Indian food outside of india.\" I said ok!They take reservations only for parties of 6+ for dinner. Too bad, we didn't have that many people. So came here on a Wednesday night around 6PM to see how our luck turned out. Ended up waiting for 45 min for table for 2. They gave us hot chai while we waited!Appetizer: Lamb samosaMain: chicken tikka, lamb briyani, black daal, cheese naanDrink: mango and fennel lassiDessert: chocolate pudding and cinnamon ice cream (normally comes with chili ice cream but the waitress allowed me to swap for cinnamon :))Verdict: Coworker was 1000% right. Best Indian food I've ever eaten hands down. And as a New Yorker self-proclaimed foodie, one of my favorites meals I've ever had in life. That's right, I'll say it! I would spend my own money to eat here again.Everything was amazing. Service was amazing. Atmosphere was very cozy and modern Indian-esque. Yes it's pricey but I think it's a very good option for some splurging! Worth the wait and maybe even meeting up with some strangers to get your table count to 6 for reservations! ;D",

I prefer breakfast/brunch here than dinner but chilli squid and some specials are good also.I'm not sure I can think of many places with as much charm, humour and ultimately; identity that I've been too. DIshoom seems to be effortlessly cool whilst being elegant and casual at the same time. I like most of their food, but I love the interiors of their Bombay Caf\u00e9s even more. There are 'rules' of the house and an authentic jukebox filled with proper indian tunes that can be played (apparantly).",

It was worth waiting for. The food is very good in decent portions easy to share. Some are very spicy but you can see that in the menu before you order. The waiter is also very helpful.

On the other hand the staff was really welcoming and nice, every ten minutes or so they kept coming and offering little glasses of either hot chai or sherry - how lovely. We tried both their chai and sherry and they were both really good.When we got inside there was another wait. We got lucky and found a place at the bar and waited there.Finally we got a table and ordered couple of dishes - Butter Chicken, Matar Paneer, naan bread and mango lassi with cardamom and eggnog chai. The food was very tasty and flavourful. I did not enjoy my eggnog chai, I think it was too sweet. And I wouldn't say it was the best I have ever tried. I'm not sure it was worth the wait for more than hour. I would definitely like to come back and try other dishes.",

    "text": "Visiting from the US, I had pretty high expectations of Indian food on the UK. Not only Dishoom deliver in taste and experience, I'm utter devastated that they've set the bar so high for all Indian cuisine that NONE in the US can compare to.When we first arrived, it was jam packed with people, I was worried we would have the longest wait if life, fortunately, not so. We were greeted by the warm smiles of our hostesses and offered that we wait at the bar for our 15 minute wait. The bartender seemed to have a keen sense of reading people because he knew exactly what I needed without me asking. It probably helped that I had no idea what to order. The Gimlet was a refreshing concoction of celery bitters, gin, lime, and a sprig of dill. One sip and I was transported straight to summer, refreshing, cool, and a little alerts cleanser. Our waitress then ushered us to our table, and with British hospitality explained with great detail how to navigate the menu to four clueless Americans. My eyes settled on the grilled king prawns and a side of basmati rice. As it arrived the Indian spices left a mouth watering aroma that left me drooling.No fuss, just king prawns encrusted with dried spices that my tongue could not pronounce. I bit and I could've burst into tears. It had the perfect char, lending a beautiful note of smoke, the spices provided a pleasant crunch before I reached the succulent meat of the prawn. The texture and flavors married perfectly into one bite. It was at that exact moment I knew I would never taste Indian food as delicious as was offered at Dishoom in the USA. To all those visiting the UK, this should be your number destination for Indian food!",

    "text": "Following several failed attempts at trying to dine at their Covent Garden location, stumbled upon this outpost late on a Tuesday night. Managed to get in just before the kitchen closed (around 11pm), thus avoiding any lines they usually have.Quickly was given menus and settled on the Lamb Samosas (\u00a34.90), Chicken Ruby (\u00a39.50), and a Roomali Roti (\u00a32.70). Certainly on the expensive side which is assuming because it's high-end quality. Food comes out amazingly fast - first being the samosas. Three well crisped triangles with ground lamb and spices inside. Pretty good on it's own, but much better with the chutney provided. Chicken and roti come out next; a solid portion of diced chicken swimming in a rich gravy. Roti is soft but a little chewier than expected. Curry has a large tangy flavor that can get intense towards the end. Extremely filling meal leaving no room for dessert. Had also ordered an East India Gimlet (\u00a37.50) - a gin-based cocktail with celery bitters that was a solid nightcap (though I ordered it early on).I'm thankful this place was around after a disappointing stop at a nearby bar. Great over-the-top flavor that's good to try at least once.",

But the breakfast--a rarity, particularly for Indian--was pretty disappointing. \u00a0I was really hoping to maximize eating Indian while in the UK, and Dishoom's breakfast just wasn't up to par.They were kind enough to swap out the chicken livers in this dish for some portobellos. But while the minced chicken keema smelled terrific, it was just a massive salt bomb, especially when combined with the equally greasy and salty buns and crisps. It was just too much and I could even finish despite it being awfully expensive for breakfast. Other diners' order of naan wraps looked awfully good too so I ordered them to go. \u00a0The bacon one was not great, the sausage one offered a bit more texture and was better.The chai tea was awesome and unlimited. The normal menu for Dishoom still looks amazing. \u00a0But don't get breakfast here.",

It is no wonder England imperialized everywhere else... they really needed some food with seasoning, taste, and that was edible. There isn't really any food you can go wrong with here, trust me I tried it all and I will do a quick line item list of what you need to do.Slaw - Had a little cranberry in there that did a wondrous job acting as the sweetener. Great crunch loved every bite and it was great as a contrast to the other flavors.Black Dahlia Curry - Great get it. Flavor that went well with some of our chicken appetizers. Smokey, a little sweet, and heaven.Appetizer Chickens - I don't remember their names so check out the pictures both were great one was a little spicier than the other.Potatoes - Went great with curry but not a must.Samosas - Good but once again not a must, if you are trying to get a little bit of everything go for it.THE VERDICT:Not the coolest experience place in London, but by far the best food. The wait staff was okay... the ambiance was decent. It was really the food alone that stood out for me and I wish we could have gone to more places like this while we were out there. There are multiple locations so you should easily be able to hit it up, even if your stay in London is short.",

The chicken dishes (ruby and tikka) were both very good, as was the naan. The dishes that were really hyped (chai and daal) were both nothing special: I think I've had better chai at home using \"Oregon Chai\" concentrate (which is admittedly pretty awesome). My complaints deal with the wait, which is understandable if a place is popular. But the beeper says right on it that they give drinks to those waiting in line (sorry, I mean \"in queue\"), and I saw none of this. \u00a0I asked about it (because I'd also read about this in other reviews), and I was told it's for times with longer lines before they hand out beepers - we'll then why does it say it ON THE BEEPER?! \u00a0Plus my wait was an hour, which deserves something.

Check-in, Enjoy a drink at the bar, and look over the menu so you can be prepared to order. Are you a desert person, try the Malai Kulfi- it's amazing (says my partner).Next Time: try Chana Chaat and the Butter Bhutta. It sounded amazing, we just didn't have enough space in our stomachs.",

Food was delicious, service was attentive and polite, menu was \"not the norm\" Indian - which made the experience even more enjoyable!",

I went once for lunch and the second time for breakfast, that's how much I enjoyed it!For lunch we tried the okra fries, salli boti, garlic naan, and chicken tikka. The okra fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy and came with different dipping sauces! The Salli boti was so flavorful and fragrant with the right amount of spice. So good with the roti/naan. And the chicken tikka was tender and definitely had a kick to it!! Everything was delicious and packed with flavor. When I went for breakfast my friend and I shared the Big Bombay & date and banana porridge. Also ordered the chocolate chai drink which was so good! The big Bombay plate came with an assortment of foods and everything was so delicious. We had no complaints whatsoever. Overall, good service, delicious food, would definitely recommend to anyone visiting London and wants a great meal.",

    "text": "I've had some of the best Indian food in my life here at Dishoom. This was a serendipitous lunch, because we were actually in Carnaby to eat at Mother Mash. Unfortunately for Mother Mash, they had a mechanical issue that drove us straight into Dishoom's arms. We were seated immediately and I ordered a house chai to start. On the menu, it states that \"all who have tried it are swearing by it.\" That is no lie. This chai was really, really good. Better than any chai I've had. Very warming and comforting. For food, we ordered the following:+ Pau bhaji (\u00a34.50)+ House black daal (\u00a35.90)+ Gunpowder potatoes (\u00a36.50)+ Sali boti (\u00a311.50)The food was incredible! The pau bhaji was a bowl of mashed veggies and came with a hot, housemade, buttered bun. An incredible start to the meal, with a slightly spicy kick! The house black daal is a MUST. I've never had such amazing daal before. It's got so much rich flavor, given that it's been cooked for over 24 hours. The gunpowder potatoes were great too, as they were tossed with butter and cooked with aromatic seeds and herbs. And the house special - sali boti - is a classic Parsi dish. Braised tender lamb in a rich and deeply savory sauce that's topped with crunchy crisp chips. This dish is served with a roomali roti, a soft thin bread.I would recommend every single dish we ordered. Everything was cooked to perfection and left me wanting more. Make a trip to Dishoom today.",

You have been a constant wonder for so long but finally I was able to taste your wonder and spice!Yes, Dishoom is the top rated restaurant in London, yes it's rumoured to be fantastic but it's only when you actually try their fantastic food you realise why! We went for breakfast/brunch and just made it in time (breakfast finishes at 11:45 so don't be late). We were all giddy, even Dan who has been many a time! As I am still on my health kick so I opted for the omelette with a side of masala beans and mushrooms! The food arrived quickly and was presented and served on a large tray - perfect for taking some Yelpy photo shots! And what can I say, the food was fantastic. The omelette was cooked to perfection and probably the best I've ever had. It was spiced beautifully and there wasn't a bit without a hint of something wonderful. The beans were the standout for me though - they have a kick, that's for sure, but they complimented the omelette and it truly was a taste sensation! The mushrooms were good, nothing amazing, just large fresh grilled mushrooms. Still yummy.The service, on point. The decor, a really bright and colourful array of shadows and shapes - exactly what I imagine an uptown restaurant in India to be like. I cannot fault this place and cannot wait to come back for dinner!",

Finally we were seated for lunch at the Carnaby branch.The restaurant is beautiful, and is large enough to accommodate larger groups. There is a very calming and pleasant ambience. Service is good, although we waited a long time for the food, and the staff feel professional. Ordered extra naan just after receiving our mains, and it didn't arrive until we were nearly finished.Off the extensive menu, we ordered the Mahi Tikka which was delicate and cooked well but nothing spectacular. The Chicken Ruby was a nice curry, with the chicken being moist and tender. But again, nothing that made us very excited.We of course ordered a celebrated menu staple - the Black House Daal - which was rich and spicy. It was great to dip the Naan bread in.The okra fries were very soggy and tasted like they had been sitting around for a while. I do not want to write this place off yet, as I have heard great things about their brunch (which annoyingly ends at noon!). But I am yet to be convinced.",

Sometimes it's because of authenticity, sometimes it's expertise in one style of dish, but then there are some restaurants are constantly pleasurable, no matter what the dish or what time of day. Dishoom exemplifies this perfectly- their take on Indian cuisine is contemporary, hybrid and fun. Purists might sneer, but what comes out of the kitchen is fresh, vibrant and flavoursome. And although their brunch naan rolls are genuinely worth trekking across town for, their standard menu is just as satisfying. The food speaks for itself, but the environs and service at Dishoom truly never disappoint- and this is true across all of their London branches. The newest addition to the Dishoom franchise recently opened in Carnaby, offering a fuel stop that straddles Oxford Street and Soho. I visited with a group and we squeezed in just before the 11:45 brunch cut-off time on a Saturday morning. Staff greeted me immediately with friendly banter and I was taken through the bar to our cozy booth. The restaurant is spread across two levels- the main floor is open, spacious and there's ample seating that spills out into a veranda area. Here, diners sit an airy space, underneath a skylight and encircled by retro fittings. Electric fireplace, mahogany touches and that brown/orange colour combination that was hallmark of the 60s, this level of attention to detail is perhaps Dishoom's most endearing element.The entire restaurant is designed to emulate a Bombay caf\u00e9 circa 1968 and this is achieved right down to the minutia- it's so seamlessly accomplished that it doesn't feel kitschy. Everything is casual and the continuous din of other tables makes Dishoom a buzzy hotspot- and then you get to the menu. My staple is the egg naan roll and masala beans, which I immediately settled upon given our time constraint. As always, it was perfectly rendered: a warm, pillowy naan bread made to order in the open kitchen downstairs- it came filled with two oozing fried eggs, freshly chopped coriander and an indulgent lashing of soft, creamy cheese. It's paired with a tomato chili jam- which is a worthy of its own praise- balancing savoury with sweetness and singing with a fistful of chewy naan. The masala beans are always stewed to perfection, a tangy and complex side to mop up with gummy fingers after naan has been dunked into the sticky jam. This is the apex of brunch and has never disappointed.Every dish ordered in our group seemed to provoke envy- from the house granola, an aesthetic feat with wholesome oats, chopped nuts and bursting with ripe fruit, a hearty dollop of yogurt and a fat drizzle of golden honey- to the Big Bombay, a smorgasbord of breakfast fare with an Indian twist. One diner was compelled to order a second dish after eyeing up my naan roll, which was cheerfully organised despite the fact that the kitchen had moved on to the standard menu. The food at Dishoom Carnaby won't disappoint those who frequent other Dishoom branches. The service was in line with what I've come to expect and the d\u00e9cor, ambiance and experience also lived up to my lofty expectations. Servers are occasionally bouncing between tables and need to be flagged down, but their good humour never wanes.Provided that Dishoom can continue to replicate this winning formula, I'm happy to see more of the franchise around London. After all, they are both killer and naan roll filler- so the faster I can locate a Dishoom in a bleary weekend haze, the better.",

Popped in around 5pm, and waited about 10 mins to grab a solo seat. Came in super hyped since I heard the naan here was amazing, so I ordered some Garlic Naan, and the Lamb Kebab plate.Garlic Naan: Surprisingly not fluffly. Mostly crispy. A little bummed out since I heard they were as soft as clouds, but hey it could have been an off day.Lamb Kebab - Nice spices on the lamb, but the lamb kebabs themself were a bit dry. Had a simple drink on the side, but overall the meal itself wasn't that great. I'm going to have to go back and try the chicken ruby, and also the naan again to see if I get the soft one i've heard about.",

    "text": "I don't normally go out of my way for Indian food, but when in London, you've got to try this place. Best Indian food EVER!We sat outside along the walkway which was perfect for people watching. I think the passersby in general were curious as to what Indian food is all about. People would literally stop and stare to see what was on our table.Service was outstanding with our waitress making thoughtful suggestions. The Bombay Pimm drink - mint, citrus, pomegranate, and coriander served with ginger beer instead of lemonade - was refreshing in the warm weather.The one dish you have to get? Salli boti. It's braised lamb in a rich and flavorful gravy served with buttered roti bread. I ordered a half plate and ended up ordering a second because it was that good. If you're on the fence about lamb or have never tried it, then order it here and make this your first. Order the garlic naan as well. The bread was terrific by itself but even better with the lamb.We tried many dishes and they were all delicious. The favs were the prawns - Masala if you like it grilled or Koliwada if you want a little more tamarind flavor with date chutney. The chicken tikka was good too. Although the biryani was wonderfully aromatic, I'd pass on this and carb up with the naan. There's just so much else to try.The food is amazing. Be sure to make reservations. There's little to no chance that you're going to walk in and sit down...especially if you're a party of four or more.",

While in London, I needed to find a delicious meal for, what was likely, my only chance to score some delicious naan, samosas and curry. I landed on Dishoom. We arrived around 630 and there was already an hour wait. Thankfully, we were not super starving so we headed to the bar for a round or two of cocktails. They were very well made and our waiting time flew by. Thankfully our buzzer buzzed and we were seated. We grabbed an order of lamb samosas to start, followed with a cheese naan, garlic naan, roasted potatoes and an order of chicken curry. Now. We wait. The samosas arrived in three crispy little pockets of philo, expertly seasoned. They paired very well with the small sauces placed on the table before service. The naan was the perfect dipper for our curry which was nicely spicy while not being overwhelming. The small potato chunks were covered in dry seasoning and tasty. This meal (sans drinks) only cost about \u00a340 which was nice for all the plates we got. It was so good that I was able to get Chuck to go to the other location one more time before leaving.",

Goes well with the grilled meats and roti.Chicken Ruby - tastes similar to Tikka masala but a bit spicier and not as buttery. Roomali roti - like that it's not too flaky. Garlic naan - decent. not very fluffy.Service was okay. Water refill could be much faster.

The staff was great about explaining house specialties and the appropriate number of dishes to order (apparently 2-3 small things per person). \u00a0Our favorite dishes were the lamb samosas, raita (a yogurt and basil-type dip), and the house special. \u00a0Important to note is that this house special dish varies between Dishoom locations, and the one of Kingly Street was excellent! \u00a0We found the black daal to be underwhelming (given how popular it seems to be) in comparison to the house specialty. No reservations needed for lunch on a weekday, but be prepared to wait ~1 hour for dinner. They may bring you spiced chai to sip on while you wait in line!",

Arrived on a Thursday evening, was told there would be an hour and fifteen minute wait, but actually only had to wait around 20 minutes. I will say that their process seems overly complicated, we first had to give our name to a man across the alley with a tablet, and five minutes later he gave us the go ahead to see the hostess inside for a pager.The okra fries were phenomenal. Great seasoning and came out hot and fresh. The grilled corn was also fantastic, amazing flavor profile with the smokiness from the charcoal with the chili and lime. The chicken tikka was moister than other chicken tikka I've had, it seems like they use fattier pieces. It was good. The chicken ruby aka butter chicken seems to be a favorite but I'm not a huge fan of butter chicken, so I found this dish to be fine but nothing special. Overall, it was a fantastic meal, I would go back for the okra and corn alone.",

He suggested we arrive about 30-45 minutes in advance, knowing there would be a long queue. We got there at about 6pm and waited 50 minutes outside just to get the pager! Luckily, the weather was unusually warm and we were offered sweet wine and tea. Once inside, we waited about another 50 minutes at the bar. It was very crowded, but we were fine sipping on our Gimlets. We were seated by a fireplace with sofa seating, which was cute. Our friend did the ordering, but everything was delicious. Looking back at the menu, we had the okra fries, chicken ruby, chicken tikka, black daal, jackfruit biryani, roti, and cheese and garlic naan. By the end of the meal, we were stuffed. I enjoyed the ambience at Dishoom and the surrounding area in Carnaby was also a joy to walk through.",

    "text": "Easily some of the best Indian food I've ever had. Got recommended this place by a friend and absolutely had to go out of my way to try it and I would recommend it to anyone.We ordered the Okra Fries, Paneer Tikka, House Dahl, Garlic Naan, Basmati Rice and Mango Lassis for drinks. The okra fries are literally to DIE FOR. They are crispy, spicy and light and somewhat healthy because it's okra. Way better than any french fry or onion ring I've ever had and definitely use the dipping sauces (the orange one is the best). The paneer tikka could've used more flavor, but they were well made and tasted great with the dipping sauces. There was not much special about the naan or rice, but the House Dahl was awesome. Not a huge fan of dahl in North Indian cuisine, but this one had a hint of spice and a really deep taste and went great with both the naan and rice. The lassi was slightly the only disappointment as it was not creamy and was too sour.Debated between 4 and 5 stars for this place, but I was extremely impressed by the service. I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and half the food had already come out. The waiters are all nice and the vibe of the place is awesome! Will definitely be coming back next time in London.",

This location is right near a ton of shopping options and also has outdoor seating. It was about a 30 minute wait at 4pm for two people. We were seated outside where the waiter asked us for our drinks. Their house chai is delicious (and also bottomless). We also ordered, chicken ruby, naan, chicken tikka and lamb kebabs. After that, the service was horrible. Super super slow. Food took forever to come out and they forgot about the chicken ruby so we waited an extra 30 mins after we had finished eating the rest of the food. Waiters were hard to track down outside. However, a waitress did give us fresh complimentary naan as ours got cold in the meantime, which was greatly appreciated. Food-wise, everything is delicious!! And they do not hold back on the spice! Super flavorful, tender chicken and one of the best indian foods I've had!! I would definitely come back again and I hope I just caught service on a bad day. Because of that, I knocked the review down 1.5 stars.",

As in all indian restaurants the rice and naan bread are ordered separately. \u00a0Everything was flavorful and delicious! I was most surprise with the lentil curry. \u00a0It was so creamy and tasty! I also recommend the rose lassi, it was so refreshing! For dessert you got to try the kulfi ice cream on a stick! We had the mango and the original and can't decided which flavor we enjoy better. \u00a0We love this place so much we came back the very next morning for breakfast!! \u00a0The naan bread roll is sooooo goooood!! \u00a0I wish I didn't have to share that with my husband because his omelet was only so-so. \u00a0Overall a great Indian restaurant with friendly service.

The menu is a wonderful inspired twist on traditional Indian fare, the drinks included. The food was quite yummy but more impressive then the flavor was just how the chef chose to put dishes together. It was a delightful and interesting dining experience. East India Gimlet - their specialty drink, so delicious I could drink all day!Bombay Colada - lovely twist on pina coladaRomali Roti - fun thin bread to eat, this was nice with the matar paneer or anything with sauceVeg Samosas - pretty traditional and yummyChana Chaat Salad - tasty and fresh and healthyBowl of Greens was very yummyMahi Tikka - Such a delicately prepared fish! I loved this! It was even more tender than \"flaky\" can describe. It pretty much melted in my mouth. Mattar Paneer - Paneer was in something of a red tomato based sauce that slightly reminded me of Italian tomato sauces but was very rich and thick with sweet peas in it. This was delightful. Fa fa - fun to eat, they brought complimentaryI loved eating here. It was a fun and interesting treat and dining experience. The menu was interesting to navigate with all the twists and turns.

    "text": "\"have you tried Dishoom?\" \"You haven't tried Dishoom?\" This had been going on far too long - it was time to have an opinion of my own about this Dishoom restaurant I had been hearing so much about. It was a colleagues farewell lunch, and when I called to book a table for 11, I was initially told this was not possible - only when I told the lady at Dishoom that this was for lunch did she say that they can take a booking. This only made me more curious.The restaurant is set on Kingly street, which runs parallel to both regent and Carnaby street. Upon entering the restaurant one is taken aback by just how deep it goes - it is very spacious and almost feels like you have travelled to India 1970. With old school Indian music playing in the background (soundtrack available to purchase from dishoom also) we sat down on our table. The menu came promptly and we were impressed with the diversity of Indian dishes available and the interesting names they had (e.g. gunpowder potatoes, so called due to their sulphuric taste and the special salt used to prepare them i believe). Since we were many, we ordered a bit of everything and decided to share when the food arrived.The food. All our conversations halted when the food arrived, because we were too busy stuffing ourselves. The black daal is wonderful and the naan just the right balance of burnt and oily. The meat in the Biryani was very tender and the paneer of the paneer tikka was soft and moist. Each dish as it arrived drew eyes and our forks, knives and hands. I'll let the pictures do the talking.The service was excellent our (none of them Indian, bht not a problem) waiters were polite and knowledgeable. We ordered Kingfisher beer and mango lassis for drinks, which was great as the day was hot. For desert we ordered the Kulfis (ice cream) which were delightful.I can't recommend this restaurant enough. I have been told each franchise is slightly different, so I'll have to try the other Dishooms - here, the decor is very pretty and elegant, the service good, the food excellent. Decent value for money, I would love to visit again and try tor breakfast menu. 5/5.",

    "text": "Dishoom hands down was my favorite meal in London. When everyone says you can't go to London without getting curry, I can see why; London's Indian food scene is no joke. My boyfriend and I have never eaten at an Indian restaurant before, so we were a little hesitant. With a quick Yelp search, Dishoom came up as the best Indian restaurant in London, so we just had to come here on our last day. Tip - I read how the waits at Covenant Garden are excruciating long; there was no wait and ample seating at this location, so do come here instead! Informed by our waiter that every dish is meant to be shared, so order 2 dishes per person, my boyfriend and I shared the lamb samosas, the carnaby special, and the chicken ruby with 2 orders of garlic naan (we originally order 1 order of garlic naan, but it was so good that we had to have another order. It tastes better piping hot when it's super fresh and so worth the hand burns!). Everything was absolutely delicious! I legit died and couldn't stop saying how good the food was with every bite! The lamb samosas wasn't oily / greasy and felt light; it was also flavorful on its own, but tasted even better with the red pepper sauce provided. The carnaby special is great for those who want to sample lamb / love lamb as the lamb was tender and didn't have that gamey aftertaste that lamb tends to have sometimes. This dish was my boyfriends favorite with the thinner naan that the dish came with. My favorite was the chicken ruby as the curry was slightly spicy, but most importantly, the chicken was SO tender and juicy. You can honestly taste how complex this dish is and how much hard work went into making this curry. Ughhhhhh, I wish I had more as I'm writing this review. And yes, I mopped up the entire bowl with the garlic naan without shame. The menu suggests the thinner naan for this dish, but DON'T DO IT. The thickness of the garlic naan is the way to go. Dishoom, why did I visit you on my last day?! I seriously wish I took more advantage of the Indian scene from the moment I arrived at the airport in London.",

    "text": "Another restaurant crossed off my list. Let's start with the restaurant itself: the place is superbe, with its copper bar and its room at the back with cosy armchairs and the fireplace. This is definitively a good place to wow someone. The food is as good as the place is beautiful. You know that feeling when eating indian that you just ate something really hot and spicy without actually being able to differentiate the tastes (is it chicken? I'm sure that's fish! Funny I thought I order vegetarian). Here is the complete opposite. Tasty dished where you can actually taste all the ingredients. The dished are tapas so it's best to take 2-3 each and share (it's so hard to choose that you will want to share anyway). For 4 people we ordered 8 dished, 2 rices and some naans. That was the perfect quantity for lunch. Why am I saying that because you'll want to keep space in your stomach for desert. The pinapple crumble smelled delicious and the caramel ice cream is just to kill for. Pricewise count \u00a325-30 per head. A bit expensive but so worth it. (My colleague's wife - who's indian - said it was the only indian place worth going)",

You inevitably always have to wait about at least an hour, but they do their best to help that hour pass by quickly. We were served a selection of mint tea, lemonade, and chai tea as we waited outside in the queue. They ushered us into a bar area where we can get some drinks before being seated (good tactic, huh?).It's always nice to go with a larger group so you can share a variety of dishes. As a pescetarian, I always get the mattar paneer, which is one of the best curries I've had in London. My husband loved the Chicken Ruby. At this location I tried the Pau Bhaji, which is DELICIOUS. Next time, I'm not going to ask anyone to share this dish with me!If you're around King's Cross and can wait a bit for food, definitely stop by here for some amazing curry!",

Me and my boyfriend liked it a lot. It's a little too salty for me but my boyfriend feels it's okay. Also the lamb fried dumpling we had for starter. I liked it so much, unfortunately I forgot it's name on the menu.We came in around 1:30pm and had waited for around 30 minutes for a seat there. The place is really popular. I had a Bombay colada with rum while waiting and I didn't like it because the syrup tastes too heavy. For entr\u00e9es, my boyfriend had Lamb boti Kebab and it was too dry. I had Awadhi Lamb I liked it so much, the rice is so aromatic, and the lamb is well cooked. They dont serve naan bread complimentary, you need to order them separately.",

    "text": "Another fantastic breakfast from Dishoom! The newest Dishoom on Carnaby Street has the same authentic (I actually have no idea but it feels it!) feel as the other branches. Some darker areas with moody yellow lighting along with a beautiful glass ceilinged area which is kitted out with sofas and a fire place making it feel like you've walked in to a retro flat. We went as a group of six and booked (did you know they take bookings for breakfast, lunch and dinner!!!) a table just before breakfast service finishes at 11.45. Tbh I thought the service was a little slow and they weren't overly attentive but the food came out in a reasonable time so that's the main thing!This time I opted for their house granola, fruit and yoghurt with fire toast, breakfast lassi and chocolate chai (just a small breakfast!). I've had the granola before and absolutely love it! It's full of nuts and sugary oats and the vanilla yoghurt and tasty fresh fruit that accompanies it is always the best quality. The fire toast was an impulse as I really wanted to try the pineapple and peppercorn jam and unfortunately the jam was a little disappointing. The toast itself is nice but would be even better with some bacon or egg (not that I could have fitted that in). Both drinks were very filling so be warned.... But also so worth it. The chocolate chai is such a treat and the lassi is so refreshing with a lovely oaty texture. Again getting the bill took a little while but overall a lovely breakfast out which is a little different to the usual pancakes or eggs benedict. P.s. On the way to the toilets you are able to see the chefs at work :)!",

Dhishoom is just what we needed after a long day of shopping and unpacking! Waited an hour for a table, but fear not. Enjoyed a chilled wheat beer followed by a whisky sour made with real egg white by the bar. We were hungry so ordered the okra fries and calamari. Both were delicious and served with a variety of chutneys. Once we finally got a table, we settled for Romali Roti (very rare to find outside of india), seekh kebab, and saali mutton (similar to a mutton curry) Everything was spot on delicious :)! Our server was also friendly and I loved the atmosphere. Overall a memorable experience!",

In fact, quite the reverse with some very tasty interpretations or adaptations of Indian staples.. Definitely try the Chole Bhatura or the Sali Boti (the house daal is a must) and for drinks, go for the lassi. Enjoy",

The naan was oversalted and burned, mahi masala lacked flavor, chicken tikka masala wasn't great (untrimmed fat on the chicken, not grilled all the way through and not flavorful), samosas were thick and too crispy. Chicken biryani was good but I honestly had better. Maybe this is the standard fare in the UK compared to the US but there are so many much better restaurants than this one! Look elsewhere",

On this trip of mine when I wanted to have cup of tea we decided to go to this place just for drinks and desserts. When we arrived here there was no queue outside around noontime. Entrance has a Ganesha statue as their other branches. They have various seating rooms and areas and some lounge seating at the back. I had to wait about 20 min to get a table. This time we tried the chai, rose lassi, mango lassi in our group and for the desserts had their malai kulfi and chocolate pudding with spicy ice cream. Everything was excellent - as per Dishoom standards.Great ambiance and awesome experience. If you have never been here this a must visit Indian food place in London.",

    "text": "AMAZING Indian food. Dishoom is a trendy, hipster place, but it does not lose out on flavor and quality of each individual dish. The space is much larger than expected, and even has a \"garden\" room under a skylight. The dishes come out when they come out, so service moves quicker. Our server advised 2-3 plates per person and we gladly took that to heart because it was hard narrowing down all the dishes we wanted to try. We loved Dishoom so much that the next day, we stopped by Cinnamon Soho and turned around to head straight back to Dishoom just a block and half away. I was sad to have to fly back to NY the next day, otherwise I certainly would have fit in a third visit before leaving. Here's what we ordered and we loved everything!- Lamb samosa (4.90): Like the description says, they use phyllo dough instead of the Punjabi shortcrust version. I actually prefer the phyllo dough because it's crispier and lighter, making it a perfect appetizer without filling you up with dough. The minced lamb is spiced well with cumin and shines through. Eat it with the mint, tomato, and tamarind chutney!- Pau bhaji (4.50): Mashed vegetables, mostly tomato, beans, and potatoes. Slather it on the hot buttered homemade buns and you have a little veggie Indian slider snack. We had extra leftover so we scooped it up with the naan, which I actually prefer over the buns.- Chicken tikka (7.90): Delicious, flavorful, and a good char. I love chicken tikka and this was by far one of the best ones that I've had. The chicken remained moist and tender, which is usually not the case at most restaurants.- Masala prawns (11.20): If you prefer seafood to chicken and lamb, then this IS definitely the dish for you. It's marinaded in a green chutney thick sauce and grilled to absolute perfection. The shrimps are plump and succulent. I love love loved this dish. I wish this is how my shrimp come out every time I cook it over the barbecue.- Lamb biryani (9.90): Could use more lamb, but the rice is spot on, like seriously spot on. The rice is cooked in stock and spices and it really is just absorbed in the rice. When it comes to biryani, I always order lamb over chicken because the deep, rich flavor of lamb fills the rice more than chicken could ever. - Chicken ruby (8.50): You need a curry dish to go with naan... Dishoom only offers a chicken or paneer one. It's really like the iconic British chicken tikka masala, sweet, tomato-y, creamy, and buttery. About three pieces of chicken and the rest is curry... which isn't bad considering how much food we ordered!- Garlic naan: (2.50): Standard naan, but not say it's a bad thing! - Roomali rotiOverall, the food is to die for. This is by far one of \u00a0the best Indian restaurants that I've been to in NY and London. Luckily we didn't have to wait too long for a table during the late lunch hour. First day was only 15 minutes around 2pm on Sunday and the second was 30-45 mins on May Day. Service is hit or miss. The first time, our server was slow and couldn't really take our cues for when we were joking and being sarcastic... the second time, our server was so much more friendly and welcoming. If I'm in London again, I'll definitely make this one of my first visits!",

The food is always outstanding, the cocktails are great, the prices are super reasonable, the ambiance is charming, and the location couldn't get any better. Therefore it wouldn't be fair to give Dishoom anything less than 5 stars.Three things I highly recommend: sali boti, chicken ruby, and calamari. \u00a0If you're a meat eater, order all three! (I'm drooling now just thinking about them.)I've been to three different Dishoom locations (Covent Garden and King's Cross), and wherever or whenever you go, you know you'll receive the same delicious food with attentive service. However compared to Covent Garden, I've noticed that this location is surprisingly better in terms of wait times. \u00a0As usual though, I would recommend coming a little early to avoid waiting outside in the rain.",

On my second visit - Saturday evening around 7PM I saw a huge line outside the restaurant and was told there is a one hour wait. They serve complimentary chai to guests waiting outdoors - pretty cool, yeah?! You can tell that the place is usually packed because they have 3 hosts and 5 servers to serve only 1/4th of the restaurant. Interiors - The place Is decorated in a very homely yet chic fashion with old style chairs and tables, stainless steel utensils, pictures of family members on walls and diyas on tables. They have adopted a very interesting style of decorating the bathrooms as well - WC style, for those who know what that means.",

Dishoom is located in the heart of the carnaby street and has some delicious dishes to offer. The reason why I give this place a 4 star is that the wait is much longer anytime and any day of the week and there are very limited vegetarian options to try from. This is a street side food joint without a twist straight from Bombay as they put it! The food is good delicious but I still feel this place is a bit overrated. There are only 4-5 veggie small plate dishes to choose from but all are very flavorful. Still wish they had more vegetarian options to choose from. Coming back again if I crave for some street side Indian food.",

    "text": "Best. Indian. Food. Ever.So now that that's out of the way, on to the meaty stuff: the review.Visiting London for work left little room for free time because of my super intense jet lag. My boss and her husband were going to dinner and since she's remote, this was a great opportunity for me to spend some non-working hours with her. They say a connected team works best right?Located walking distance of the Oxford Circle tube station, it's just the right location. You walk over and stand in a line outside to put your name in for a table. If it's raining, they have complementary umbrellas; luckily we had one from the hotel (see review for the Landmark Hotel). While you're in line, they will bring you chai or Sherry (so much yes). After our wait ended, we were able to then go inside and wait at the bar. With three of us, we each ordered different drinks. I opted for the Bollybelini first, Jake had an old fashion, and Liz had a twist on the whiskey sour. Yes, my girly drink wasn't exactly strong but o wanted to try something different than my norm. We ordered a second round of drinks and I had the Velvette Fog which consisted of chai ice cream, coffee liqueur, and vodka. So, it was dessert before the meal. For my last round (yes we ordered three before being seated) I had a big girl drink which was equally delicious. Each drink was 7\u00a3-8\u00a3.On to the food: it's family style and sooooo inexpensive. Go for the vegetable samosa - you will not be disappointed. That's what I picked and we agreed on garlic naan. I can't remember anything else because I let them do the selecting but it was ALL delicious. The food costed 50\u00a3 total and we had PLENTY of food. It also came out within 3-4 minutes of ordering which was good because we were starved by the time we sat down. I would absolutely recommend this to others and already have. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Died and went to heaven. Absolutely amazing food and such a great, lively ambience! The prawns were one of the highlights, as well as the Chicken Berry Biryani (O.M.G.) Being Indian American, I tend to look at most restaurant Indian food as a heavy, oily mush that is high on punchy and fatty flavors but low on the complexity you see in real home-cooked Indian food. This place is truly the antithesis of \"restaurant Indian food\" - each bite is so delicately balanced, with the flavors expertly crafted & deliberately designed. The unique twist with the slight Persian influence is also something that is truly magical and unlike anywhere else I've ever eaten in the world (including India!). Even something as simple as the Raita was just so carefully spiced and flavored - as a condiment, it truly took the main dishes to the next level. Bravo to Dishoom for curating such a lovely culinary experience that stays authentic to India, but transports you to a new realm of tastes at the same time!",

Well, I can confidently say that it most definitely is!Sure, there's a bit of a wait if you don't have a group booking, but the staff are amazing and they serve cocktails and snacks at the bar if that's your thing.We were seated in the courtyard, which is super colourful and comfortable with patio type furniture. Since it's under a glass roof and it was still sunny outside, it was also much brighter than the rest of the restaurant. I loved the courtyard! Our server was very helpful with recommendations and helping with our food selection. They really are very well trained and attentive here.The food was phenomenal! Perfectly flavourful and lightly spicy, very well rounded and great quality. I really enjoyed the entire experience very much, definitely worth the wait!",

Our meal here was probably the best meal out of our entire trip. They stop taking orders for breakfast at 11:45. Then they take a 15 minute break. You can start ordering off the lunch menu at noon. We got there at 11:30am, ordered house chai and a bacon naan off their breakfast menu as \"appetizer\" then ordered off their lunch menu later at noon for our main courses. There is a 12.5% gratuity that is automatically added to your bill. They make it clear that this is optional and you can ask them to remove it. However, we felt absolutely no need to. The service was great and the food was so good that we would have tipped much more!!",

But the tea gave me some energy and we waited for ~ 50mins. My family was getting restless but I nudged them to be a bit more patient as the reviews promised that it was worth the wait. I was hoping that I was not building up the hype ..... as I know for sure the hubby and kids wont flinch to give their candid opinion after all the wait. And boy what a lovely treat! The dinner was super yumm and totally worth the wait. We tried the okra fries, \u00a0lamb appetizer (I think the name was kebab that was truly the yummiest thing I ate), chicken ruby and jackfruit biryani. The thought of their food itself is mouth watering. If I could, I would fly all the way from SFO for this food.I wish they opened one branch in SFO too.",

We decided to stick it out and I'm glad we did. They offer you some light drink while you wait. The first part is waiting outside. Then you can wait inside the bar, which is nice because you can get drinks while you wait. I didn't get one but my girlfriend enjoyed hers. The staff was very friendly as we waited and they have a difficult job, dealing with hungry people waiting. Some people are unfortunately not very nice to them We actually waited at the outdoor tables once we made it past the line across the street. After a while we were buzzed in for our table. The restaurant has a great look, 70s Bombay. Funky music playing and a friendly staff. We were excited to finally be inside and we were hungry. We ordered a variety of dishes. Enjoyed it all. Especially the fish and chicken tandoori. The naan was excellent. The chicken masala we was very good. Great experience overall. And great food. I think one dish we got, a lamb dish, was a tad oily. But overall we were happy. In addition it was very reasonably priced. One of the last expensive dinner we had in London. Can't wait to go back. Maybe with a large group so we can make a reservation.",

They brought us chairs from inside so that we could sit (we were lugging or young kids). We ordered almost everything vegetarian in their menu. Paneer kebabs, paneer roll, black daal makhani, potato chaat, their seasonal dahi chaat, naans, rumali roti, rice, kulfi, okra fries.... ok, we ordered everything. I have to tell you - you must not miss the okra fries. They're we're unique and delicious. The daal was insane. The paneer roll makes me drool right now. The drinks were made perfect.

    "text": "My family and I love Indian food, and we knew that London was known for its Indian food. We needed a place that was convenient for us to walk to from our hotel. I found Dishoom on Yelp, and it was perfect! It's super close to Carnaby St and Regent St and tucked away in a cute cobblestone walkway that was decorated with lots of string lights and filled with people of all ages walking around. Turns out, Dishoom is a VERY popular restaurant, and we were told that the wait for our party of 3 would be about 45 min - 1 hour. So, I recommend trying to make a reservation beforehand. However, we were able to snag some seats at a high table by the bar and order some drinks and hors d'oeuvres while we waited. It was a Friday evening, and the bar and restaurant area were packed with patrons. It was a lively and positive environment! Dishoom definitely seems like the kind of place to come and relax with friends and/or family for a wholesome meal. There's even an \"outdoor\" patio in the back -- it's completely covered with glass window panels so people can sit out there even when it's raining. The patio has lounge seating and a nice garden decor and style, perfect for happy hour or a post-work dinner and drinks with friends. \u00a0While we were at the bar, my party and I ordered some virgin cocktails and vegetable samosas. I had the watermelon sharbat, a yummy fizzy drink that was very refreshing. I really liked that Dishoom offered an array of tasty virgin cocktails! The vegetable samosas were perfectly crispy on the outside. I don't know if the time just flew by or what, but it definitely didn't feel like we waited a whole 45 minutes before we were called to be seated! After we were seated, we ordered some more of those delicious vegetable samosas and perused the menu for dishes. The menu has many options and is great for vegetarians! As most Indian restaurants are styled, the food at Dishoom is meant to be shared. We ordered Mahi fish tikka, House Black Dhal, Vegetable Biryani, and the Chole Frankie roll. All the dishes came hot and were packed with spices and flavor. We enjoyed our entire meal! For our first night in London, we had great night at Dishoom and appreciated the warm welcome from the staff! We will for sure return to Dishoom next time we visit London!",

It was great we made the cutoff for reservations because when we arrived at the restaurant at 6pm, the inside was already packed (which was impressive because the restaurant is quite big) and a line was already forming with hungry patrons. We ordered an assortment of foods to share family style including lamb samosas, dishoom calamari, biryani, garlic naan, a bowl of greens, mattar paneer and chicken ruby to name a few. Everything was so delicious. Very well-seasoned, fresh tasting. The samosas were crisp on the outside, hot and filled with potatoes and lamb on the inside. The curries and ruby murray were creamy, perfect with the biryani and naan. The vegetables were a great balance against the more heavier foods. \u00a0Everything came quite quickly so our hunger was nicely satisfied. We \u00a0ordered a bunch of viceroy's old fashioned which hit the whiskey spot. We also ordered the Bombay presidency punch which was huge and plenty to share between 6 people. This place (which has multiple locations throughout London and I believe to be just as busy) is definitely worth a try! Great interior, good service and delicious food!",

You can fill in this time by perusing their enormous food and drink menu. That being said, this place has garnered a ton of popularity and loyalty for a reason. The prices for the food are surprisingly low for the kind of quality you get, and the uniqueness of the menu rivals anything else you'll find nearby. This isn't your typical Indian fare, either. Sure, you have your typical garlic naan- amazing, by the way- your roti and curries, samosas, marinated lamb, chicken and seafood, and don't forget several different types of lassis (not just mango); but you'll also find many traditional dishes known only to those who have spent time in places like Bombay and know that culture intimately.From personal experience, I can say that the drinks- especially the cocktails are interesting and amazing- and their Baileys Chai is close to my heart. They serve a rich coffee called 'Monsooned Malabar Coffee,' which I suggest getting as a latte for extra thickness. Trust me, if you know good coffee, you won't ask for sugar.Their chicken and lamb dishes which pair perfectly with their garlic naan or roti, which is a large crepe-like bread you can unroll and tear into as you go along.So, pull up a chair, order a drink, and wait for the deliciousness to ensue. It's worth trying at least once.",

It's worth the wait in the bar for a table. On a Monday night we waited an hour.",

It was good, indeed we came back the next morning for bacon-and-egg naans, which is something I'd happily do again (perhaps once the light mornings of Spring roll around, London is far too grey far too often in Winter at 8am - and those crisp, bright mornings should be spend wandering around a park instead).The food is 'upmarket' Indian which is great, but without stretching to haute cuisine I find it hard to see how 'good' the dishes can be, particularly when you still can find a layer of oil on the top. That being said, there was a nice selection of mains.However, the breakfast naan is to die for. It is perhaps my top-rated single item breakfast in London, such a good mix of flavours and textures that I'm not sure exactly how to relate it to you. If the menu description of fresh naan \"graced with a little cream cheese, chilli tomato jam and fresh herbs, and wrapped around one of these first-rate fillings\" sounds at all appetising to you, then please do check it out. The chai is milky and sweet (perhaps a touch so for my tastes), and coffee acceptable but not stand-out.Perhaps my main issue is one of expectation, with Dishoom being touted as the best thing since sliced naan, which it unfortunately wasn't. I very much appreciate the decor, the smells wafting up from the kitchen and the smokey incense - perhaps these will draw me back here, or to another Dishoom, in the near future to sample further.",

    "text": "My husband and I really liked Dishoom at Carnaby. We had lunch rather than dinner to eschew the lines. We were very thrilled with both the service and foods. The waitress thoughtfully asked if we had food allergy. We ordered house chai, which was refillable until 5pm. What not to love about this?! We had the pau bhaji, mahi and cheese naan. They all are tasty. We sat in the patio area, with cozy decorations. We highly recommend this place to any traveler!",
