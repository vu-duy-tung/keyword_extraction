Not too much like some places where you'll never finish it, and not too little where you're gonna leave less than satisfied. I'm am leaving here satisfied.

    "text": "I have been here thrice. The fish is always fresh, perfectly fried, and the chips are seasoned with a special salt and very generous. Although some might call them wedges instead of chips!Panko wins hands down, by the way. While it seems like normal breadcrumbs, panko is literally \"breadcrumbs\" in Japanese. It's shredded in a spikier shape so it is crunchier and craggier, so it holds on to more of the seasoning. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu but my favourites are:Cajun Spiced Panko Haddock with Seaweed Salted Chips & Lemon Cajun SauceJamaican Jerk Panko Haddock with Seaweed Salted Chips & Chipotle SauceGarlic and truffle mayonnaise is not to be missed. Silky with the aftertaste of truffle clinging on to your tastebuds.Since my last visit there has been chicken on the menu, which I have yet to try. I appreciate that there's a vegetarian option and it is now clearly indicated - when I last came I saw that on the menu and thought it was rather steep because I thought it was a side dish.If I had anything to pick on it would be the lack of choice regarding the chips. They are very good potatoes but somewhat idiosyncratic. I would like to have more choices of chips, such as sweet potato, courgette or regular old yellow chips - it does get a little monotonous when ordering. Since Hook does frying so beautifully I hope they expand the types of chips on the menu.If there were tempura prawns or some proper scampi, perhaps on a seasonal menu, I would be very pleased to return. One of the things about Hook is that I want new reasons to return, and I hope the quality of the kitchen will hold up to the whims of intrepid guests.",

    "text": "Fish day at Hook Camden. Recommended by many famous bloggers as I has wanted food in Camden which is sometimes a bit ponderous.The venue is bigger than you think but the main space to left and right near Windows is more airy and light than the back bit. Not the most definitive decor or identity if I'm truthful. Not much to give a story about themselves. Though I like sometimes like the idea of it being less 'selly'.Fish ranges from cod, haddock, pollock and coley. Haddock is a particular fav of mine and I know coley to be not the most favoured fish.I choose Hand cut chips, mint mushy peas with Argentinian Panko & chimichurri sauce. Portion is bigger than you realise upon arrival (and delving deep into it all).They do need bigger boxes which act as your plates as it is a bit cramped and the paper tears underneath and it is tough to grab flakey fish with a fork thereafter.Chips or wedge I'd say are a clear winner. Handcut and plenty of them. The minty mushy peas (each got one as a side) are not as flavoursome as I would have hoped. Prefer just a standard chip shop or out of tin mushy peas.I like that the fish is sustainable and that it is all not greasy at all. So much different and cleaner feel than going to a chip shop. The fish I had was good. Very light. I think this is all because of the Panko batter. Or breadcrumb if you will. It's much healthier and much lighter thus its emphasis is on the fish itself. The Panko adds a little texture and flavour. It was interesting to see fish being flavoured with breadcrumbs and I applaude this type of thinking for something deemed conventional.My Argentinian sauce was by far the best one we tried. Others good but this one stood out. My friends liked their fish of classic and Ethiopian. The sauces really added purpose and flavour as a side to the dish so impressed by these sauces esp the Argentinian one.It's defo one to go check for yourself. I myself will come back and try the flavoured tempura fish versions I think which use sea bream and see how different they are.",

Seriously, it is sooo good.You can choose traditional fish and chips OR go with some of their gorgeous sounding (and super tasty) more original flavours. Both fish were good naked, but were *amazing* once you add their sauces. We chose one panko, and one tempura:- Lemon & Fennel Panko Hake with Seaweed Salted Chips & Lemon & Basil Sauce (\u00a310)- Lime, Mint & Wasabi Tempura of Seabream with Seaweed Salted Chips & Basil Chilli Sauce (\u00a312)* We both liked the tempura version more than the panko (it wasn't really panko...it was just normal breadcrumbs - I guess they want to sound more posh!?)* The chips were sooo good. I love using nori for seasoning...and there were so many that it is impossible to finish a whole portion.* They use lots of different types of sustainable fish - so you can keep trying now types and discover that you love them ALL!* I looooved their sauces.* The home-made lemonade was delicious too (I tried lime and mint)I'll definitely go back, and you should go and try it too!!",

Sure, they tasted fairly healthy, but they lacked substance and were 100x less satisfying than your standard chip shop chip.On to the fish. Their \"classic\" fish is coated in a panko breadcrumb crust, not batter. End result - dry fish.Lastly. I don't usually comment on condiments, but their ketchup is utterly bizarre. I don't know if they made this themselves, but it was not good. An overly sweet, runny, tomato concoction. Just stick to HeinzI'll emphasise again, this is far from an authentic British fish and chip shop. There are hundreds in London, take your pick.",

There are different choices for the batter and depending on which batter you choose, you will get cod or haddock. The lemon batter sounded good, so I got cod. My husband chose a spicy batter and got haddock. I'm not sure why, but my lemon battered cod was very greasy and so was the chips. I tried my husband's haddock and it tasted very good. \u00a0His chips were not greasy, either. \u00a0The minty mushy peas were underwhelming. Maybe there was too much mint in them. The service was very friendly. I'm not sure if I'd make the effort to go back, though.",

When I walked in, I was greeted and the worker told me I could sit wherever I liked. Once I was seated, my server came over with a menu and I waked for her beer recommendation. I ordered the lemon basil tempura fish with chips, which with a garlic aioli and mushy peas. The fish and chips were amazing. The fish was battered perfectly and I could taste the basil and lemon and was flaky. The chips were hand cut in half circles and the garlic aioli to dip it in was awesome. The mushy peas weren't my favorite. They had a mint flavor to them, which I thought I would like, but I didn't, but it was ok because the fish and chips were great. The d\u00e9cor inside was industrial, but hip and there was plenty of seating. The service was friendly and attentive. This is definitely a place I recommend for fish and chips in London and can't wait to go back.",

Not \"hooked\" at all...I found the menu and the sides quite limited. They only serve fried fish, no seafood. \u00a0Ordered Mexican spiced panko seabream with jalapeno and lime sauce, sumac & lemon tempura of seabream with baharat (what means spice in Turkish I do not know if it does make sense describing the ingredient \u00a0any other languages) sauce, Cajun spiced panko chicken what are served in little wooden boxes. I like the serving idea. Unfortunately, the fish was weak and portion size was not great. The fish were placed over the chips so the chips below were soggy. The chips actually were not chips, oily potato wedges. Moreover, it was slightly over seasoned with salt and pepper. Overall, I did not enjoy the chips. Salt and herbs overpowered. Only the chicken was nicely cooked.Atmosphere was nice; they have also party room which is a good option for big groups. Staff was helpful and attentive.I do not understand that the restaurant was listed in local cheap eats. They charge in breadcrumbs \u00a310 and in tempura \u00a312 for small fishes. It is not that cheap I assume in comparison with what you get.Overall, I respect the idea but new school fish and chips is not my cup of tea.",

The restaurants has a decent amount of seats, and take away option is available.More importantly the price is really affordable!!

I loved the curry dip that came with the meal and the chips were addictive. The fish was great as well. You can tell it wasn't the typical cod or haddock that is used for traditional fish and chips but, it was a light tasting fish and was panko breaded (as opposed to battered) which was a nice twist on the fish and chips we all are familiar with. I would definitely visit again when I'm in the Camden town area.",

Please INFORM THEM. I ordered this lemon/basil fish & chips and it was not at all \u00a0good. They used a fish called Sea Bream I believe after reading the reviews. I felt so sorry for myself that I didn't read the reviews previous to ordering this. That's not my job though. It's the servers responsibility to tell me since it's not at all listed anywhere on the latest menu they're giving out. It was fishy, still had the skin attached which was gross to me because of the fishiness it was already giving. This in particular fish is NOT GOOD for frying. It soaked up way too much oil because of its more meaty texture that In my opinion is only good for grilling, baking, broiling or WHATEVER else in the World besides frying. I know this place is probably good because I watched the people next to me tearing the shit up out of their fish which from looking at it was Panko crusted nice & flaky. PROBABLY THE COD OR HADDOCK. They were nodding their heads and looking at each other like .. mm, good right?! Yeah thumbs up. Yum! Yum! Lol oh my god. Sigh.What a damn shame. Giving 2 stars because the fries were delicious and I liked sitting by the door on those comfortable booths people watching, but my fish really sucked and I came all the way on the tube from St John's Wood to Camden Town just to try this place. Thats 3 lines, 2 changes and 11 stops. #TUBEWORLDPROBLEMS",

When the order came to the table (quickly, I might add) I thought there was no way we could finish it all - but we did. And it was ALL delish. Nice interior, cheerful service, decent prices for the portion sizes. My husband would pass on the beer, though - don't read the copy on the bottle!",

We were exploring Camden Lock Market and decided to walk over here instead of eating the the market and are SO glad we did.The food is delicious, the service is good, and the prices are reasonable. We got the lemon and basil tempura fish and chips and the malaysian curry panko fish and chips. The fish was fresh and perfectly cooked and the chips were amazing. I love that they work with sustainable fisheries and tell you about the catches of the day.We will definitely be back. Thank you for a great meal!",

    "text": "\"Oh my goodness! That was the best fish and chips I've ever had\". Says everyone ever. I always do a little smile every time I bring friends, family, work colleagues here as they absolutely love it, but I mean who doesn't! I'm totally in love with Hook if you hadn't guessed. Not in a first love, its over before you know it novelty way but in a golden wedding anniversary way where I want to keep coming here every day for the rest of my life. Trust me, its that good. \u00a0The staff here are super friendly, they have a great craft beer selection too and are happy to talk about any new beers/breweries they are selling. In fact, I found my beloved Cloudwater brewery as the result of a recommendation through the team at Hook. I've met one of the owners too at Taste of London, what a nice chap. They're just a bunch of very down to earth, genuine, friendly/happy people and you definitely feel that when you arrive. \u007f The food, well what can I say. Its not your usual fish and chips from your local chippy, it definitely has a twist to it but its good to try something a bit different every now and again. Whichever fish you try, whether that's the panko breadcrumbs style or tempura batter it will melt and flake in your mouth. Great flavours too from lemon and basil tempura style to Argentinan panko. Yum! The chips are different too, flat seaweed salty chips (you can't taste the sea honest) and the portions are always extremely generous. I'm a sauce fiend so the mix and match of 6 option is always a winner and you know what I hate more than anything...Calamari! I always have and always will BUT bizarrely I always eat it when I come here. Its so damn good! They must have slipped something in to my drink...or again it could just be the melt in your mouth taste. If you follow Hook on Instagram too you might see a cheeky 50% off offer on Mondays every now and again but I'm reluctantly telling you this as I'm worried that on my regular Monday club trips I won't get a seat but that's the beauty of Yelp I guess...sharing is caring!",
