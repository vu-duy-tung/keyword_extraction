He said it was good but not fantastic. I had sticky rice and chicken with a side of spicy cucumbers. The spicy cucumber were very interesting, but I liked it. The food was good but not great.The restaurant is very casual with picnic style tables. We actually sat at the counter because the restaurant was full. I was pleased with customer service and would be willing to return.",

    "text": "(Let's get the cons out of the way first.) The communal-style dining is done better on Wagama's long benches, where you sit at opposite sides of the table; here, the tables are square, meaning that you and your party perch around one corner, making conversation a bit of a challenge when it's busy, and when it's busy, it gets very, very noisy...(Right; now on to the pros) Don't worry about the noise, though; you'll be too busy enjoying the food to be bothering with conversation. Our party of 4 had 6/7 dishes between us (not including rice), and everything was top notch - nicely presented, with wonderful, fresh flavours bursting out of every bite. A couple of other reviewers have complained that service was slow, but that wasn't our experience. Although we had to wait a while for drinks to arrive, the food was delivered to the table very promptly. \u00a0Pro tip: Get there early. We *left* at 7.15 and the queue was already 50-odd people long, and considering how many other great eateries there are within spitting distance of Busaba, they must be doing something right if people are prepared to wait in the rain for a table. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other things on the menu.Bonus tip: Try the calamari. Forget the pale, rubbery bits of elastic band that you've had in other restaurants; these guys know how to cook it to perfection.",

My wife ordered their chicken butternut squash stir fry, and liked it. The problem is that the dishes are tiny, the chicken dish had 3 small pieces, a few cubes of squash, a bit of onion and overall was the size of a small appetizer. The salad and beef were not much bigger. Considering the price, it's almost a ripoff. Will probably not go back.",

The signature pad Thai with crab and shrimp made my 84 year father very happy. My tofu was a v small portion but delicious. However my husband was v disappointed by his shrimp soup. 4 shrimps and most of the rest of the solid Ingredients were inedible- lemon grass stems and ginger chunks. The bowl was really only half full, very mean with the glass noodles too. I had to give him most of my rice. So.... Maybe I'm spoilt by authentic Thai restaurants in LA. Unfortunately I feel like this place still has the same delightful vibe but has slipped to quite a mediocre standard in the quality and value department. Sadly I am eating peanuts not paying peanuts.",

Be prepared to wait though - this trendy restaurant is very popular and there is usually quite a long line out the door for dinner on Friday and Saturday nights. The unique wrap-around communal seating arrangement gave the restaurant an interesting vibe, but it was hard to include people seated on the other end of the bench in conversation during dinner.I had an awesome guava bellini with my meal, but it was very expensive for a tiny, tiny glass. The food was well-prepared, but it was also on the pricier side. I really liked that Busaba had many more interesting menu options than the typical Thai noodle and rice dishes, though. Thai restaurants in California tend to have HUGE portions, so the artfully plated normal-sized portions here surprised me a little. I definitely preferred the more manageable portions though - leftover Thai food never tastes quite as good the next day!",

HAHAHA IN YOUR FACE oh no wait it was at Busaba Eathai. \u00a0Fail.However, it's so good that just a small taste and I might as well be back in Thailand, along the Khao San Road, with 50p fisherman pants being waved in my face, reclining in a bar decorated with puffer fish, sipping on a Chang, contemplating a foot massage. \u00a0Good times.The Thai calamari has probably never been anywhere near South East Asia even whilst paddling along in the sea as a carefree, innocent squid, but I'll forgive them because it's the tastiest calamari I have eaten in my life, ever. \u00a0I would lay money on the fact that I am happier whilst chewing that bad boy than it ever was whilst alive and THAT'S WHY I EAT MEAT. \u00a0Pots of tea stretch to four cups and come with two biscuits. \u00a0Winner! \u00a0I love a free biscuit. \u00a0It makes me feel like I'm at the hairdressers.I know that Busaba is technically a chain, and I'm morally against them in Soho, but they pull it off. I don't want to love them, but I do. \u00a0And I think the Wardour St branch may be the original, so that soothes my conscience.I can't quite get over them charging \u00a32.50 for a small bottle of Coke. \u00a0And you have to sit at a table with Other People which grates against every one of my senses as a born-and-bred Londoner. \u00a0But the ambience is fab and the service usually pretty speedy. \u00a0Of an evening the queues stretch all the way down Wardour St, but at 1pm you'll walk straight in, making it a great spot for lunch which is slightly special, but since the mains are all under \u00a315, not too special.I've been to Thailand you know.Mmmmmm.",

I have even heard the chain restaurant is from the same owner of wagamama, which would then make perfect sense.I do recommend it for the quality of the food. It is a great experience, and worth at least giving it a go, even if you hate the cons I have cited above. It is a good cost benefit experience after all.",

What I love about this city is that you can get the most amazing meals for just \u00a310-\u00a313 per meal, and in a upscale atmosphere, with excellent service, value for money and even presentation!Busaba is one of these places, where you can have so many different experiences such as an amazing, fun night out with a big group of friends, or an intimate dinner on a date without the tension.The atmosphere is dark, relaxed and busy but I love it. Even as you walk in, there are incredible scented smells welcoming you and making you feel like you are in Asia for a moment. There is a coat rack, and plenty of room for everyone to sit and get comfortable at the big tables.There is a real feel of 'social eating' but in a more upscale manner. The food always exceeds my expectations, and I always walk away happy and with a belly full of delicious food. My favorite is the curries with coconut rice, and the natural tropical juices.Highly recommended, take a friend, your mum, or go for your birthday!",

The decor was nice here and the tables are communal. When we finally got seated, we ordered a few small plates of the Thai Calamari which was awesome (I would definitely recommend ordering that). For my entree I ordered the Pad Thai which was pretty good, I tried some of the green chicken curry which was pretty spicy but it was also very good. I would definitely recommend coming here if you're in the Soho area.",

    "text": "Still consistently good thai food in Soho. The service, prices and most importantly food are all good. The only critical thing I can think of that may be new is the habit the servers have about asking if you like spicy food. IMO the food is good enough that the kitchen should make it the right way and send it out with correct seasoning and heat level. Ie. Noodles shouldn't be spicy, and a curry should. Let customers do what thais do and add some chopped chili if they want it hotter. If someone goes to a thai restaurant and can't handle a chili in their curry they deserve to get burned. Similarly, if some bumpkin complains that their pad thai or rice doesn't come spicy you should just kick them out of the restaurant.",

It's my last day In London from Florida and I decided to give it a try since I miss my bi-weekly thai \u00a0I usually get from the thai Resturant by my house. 1. Decor:It's a very hip artsy style Resturant in an expensive part of town. The lighting is perfect and the decor is beautiful. 2. Service:The service was nearly non existent at worst and lacking at best. Our server was in another galaxy and it took him 20 minutes to bring water and wine. There are several servers for the amount of tables so there is no excuse. I had to remind him several times to get out drinks. He was swift in his responded and had no real personality. (Servers in America actually try to be pleasant for good tips.)3. Food: I ordered thai calamari. I might aswell have ordered sweet caramel toffee calamari because that's what it tasted like. It tasted like a mix between sweet popcorn and toffee. Two things that shouldn't go with calamari. My first main the chilli prawns. They were over salty and it came with way too little prawns, six to be exact and way too much salt.The friendly thai manager apologized for the salty prawns and let me pick something else. I chose the green chicken curry which was sub par and not as good as the cheap thai curry I buy by my house. My Conclusion,This Resturant is over hyped and fancy but the food does not match the decor. The food is nothing special and the service is lacking.",

I love this kind of seating as you can view others foods and interact quite easily without appearing to be nosey.The staff are informative though not always helpful; friends have felt rushed at times though i personally have never had cause to complain. If you're looking for a venue to stay all evening after meal is comlpeted then this may not be for you.Portions are good but do take a side dish or two to ensure that you don't get hungry on the way home. Pricewise it is okay; it's on par with venues like Satsuma nearby though it's not for those just wanting a quick snack.Overall a great venue with some brilliant dishes perfect for a relaxed meal during the evening",

    "text": "This place (and indeed the other restaurants within the chain) really has me torn. On the one hand, the food is genuinely pretty good, but on the other, the set-up and layout is just really uncomfortable. The square tables mean that anymore than two of you and you can't speak to each other comfortably, or avoid what the strangers next to you are talking about. Unless you can take up the whole table (around 10 of you), then you're in for an awkward meal. The staff are occasionally rude, and will either squash you in uncomfortably, or make you wait a lifetime because, despite there being empty seats, the square tables make it difficult to cater for small groups. With regards to the food, the grilled duck is always fantastic. Pink, tender and tasty. The seafood noodles are, again, always a safe bet. The quality of food isn't really in doubt, but the overall experience makes me hesitant to return (although I always seem to end up there at least once every few months).",

It is all very reasonably priced as when you first go in, I thought I could be paying a lot for a meal here. But I was wrong, you can get a large noodle dish for around \u00a37.50. Dim lighting and neutral colours make this eatery a real gem, definitely a place to take that special someone on a date as well as with a group of mates.

The service was alright, it might be because it's really busy. There's a line. We waited a while to finally get in. We were quite unhappy about being waited for so long since people behind us got in earlier than we do, and they are also bigger parties. Overall, the food does not worth 4 star. It tastes good, but not like WOW kind of good.",

(BUT that's NOT the point... the point is do NOT clean my alchool if that doesn't go on top of the EMPTY plates too). so RUDE.the food was yummy, greasy, and salty, spicy and hot of the grill, JUST the way i like it! very presentable, adn the service was quick. sure, we had to wait in line for 35 minutes, and sure we had to decide what we were eating/drinking/talking about before we even had a chance to see the interior of the place before reaching the window (let alone the door), but at the end of the day.. err.... night was totally worth it!!!obviously being seated at the communal tables (seating about 12 each) is a great experience, ESPECIALLY if you're a big group (or if you speak a different language, which your communal table compatriots do not understand) and last but not least it's a rewarding experience if you're going to strike up conversation with anyone that is sharing the same munching surface with you.NOT ideal spot if it's a first date, if you are going to break up with someone, or telling them... you're pregnant.very nice, would go back, with maybe a slightly larger group, can't see myself eating at a communal table if i don't have a full schedule of topics to talk about, or if people around me are not ordering weird items.wine - cheapthe duck (grilled) - GETsome weird fish stew thing that was last in the menu and that the waitress suggested, SUCKED... so she should be punished for suggesting that lol.. j/k it's ok..... next time.. will get something ELSE!!!Ori will be BACK!!!",

    "text": "There's a reason why Busaba Eathai is a hot topic consistently on Yelp! It's because it freakin rocks... and using the power of words and carefully constructed sentences... I shall illustrate why. I shall firstly justify why this establishment isn't a five star review, so that we all end on a high and we can skip around the room naked. Whilst the queue outside can be a long, dull experience for most I actually quite like it. It gives you a chance to peruse the menu and banter with the person you with. However, if that person has had a long day at work and have only eaten a cracker for lunch, the wait can be one of the most painful experiences as you gaze longingly at the delicious food served to the patrons through the glass windows of destiny. So half a point off for this painful part of the process. The second reason that Busaba doesn't deserve the full fury of my five stars is that, once in and seated, you get the distinct impression they (the staff) would like to to eat and get out as quickly as possible please. Whilst I can appreciate why this is the case, sometimes it is nice to savour your food, company and the thrill that comes with sitting in such close proximity with your fellow diners. However, once you've eaten your food, expect the bill to be on your lap quicker than you can say \"Eathai\". Having said that though, there is also a reason why I visit this cheeky little number on a frequent basis. Not only is the food superb. I've honestly never had any cause for complaint and despite wanting you out, the staff are super friendly and if you need anything it arrives immediately. Once you enter into the dimly lighted dance floor and are seated on a wooden bench, this is where things take a turn for the better. The food ranges from noodle soups to pan-fried deliciousness to a whole host of awesome curries. My personal favourite is the duck massaman curry with Jasmin rice, which will set you back around 10 English doubloons. The other two dishes I can recommend are the \u00a0the Pad Thai, standard favourite at most Thai eateries, and also the pumpkin curry. Expect to pay around the same amount for these as the duck massaman. The other thing is that Busaba is good value for money. There are few places in Soho I have found where the atmosphere, food, service are all equally matched by the top prices. \u00a0A meal for two with a bottle of wine will set you back \u00a340.00. If you are in the Soho area Busaba comes highly recommended... Oh and I'm always free if you taking me out for lunch. Sexy.",

    "text": "update 15 June 2010 Received a thoughtfully-written email from Lesley Vaughan of Busaba Eathai's Operations department in response to my Qype review, reassuring me that BE does its best to ensure \"you have a great experience while dining at Busaba any time of the day\" and that policy is by no means to shoo customers out before they've had a chance to down their Thai calamaris and Chiang Mai noodle soup. So, I'm impressed by their prompt and sincere response, have enough good experiences to let this one go, and am mollified and grateful not to have to carry yet another grudge. And also grateful for their offer of a goodwill voucher, which I'll use the minute it arrives. A *update 2 June 2010 I was totally taken aback the other night, having asked if the kitchen was still open on arrival at about 10.30 and then waited nearly around 20 minutes for the food to arrive, to be told some 15 minutes after it had arrived that the the restaurant was closing and \"would we mind finishing up\". When I explained that the food had taken a long time and I'd had to remind the staff three times that we were waiting, the response was that \"it's normal, when it's this busy, for food to take a little longer, and 'I can give you another 10 minutes, but no more'. Had the waiter who originally shown us the table told us, at the time, that the restaurant would close at, say, 11.15, we would have been able to choose to eat elsewhere. Even though the woman who asked us to hurry did her best to be polite, it's incredibly rude to ask people to either bolt or leave food that they've paid for. Especially when they've already got a mouthful of food. As usual, the food was great, but the evening was spoiled and my guest, an American friend on business, was horrified. Now Rosa's has opened three blocks away, offering better service and value for money, a more intimate dining atmosphere, and is an authentic Thai business, I'll be dining there instead. This is a real shame, because as you can see below, Busaba used to be one of my favourites. Sadly, this often happens when you're so busy you can take customers for granted. Bye bye, Busaba. It was great, for a while. --------- Food here, and I've noticed there's a prompt for tagging the calamari, is terrific, and, for the quality, reasonably priced; 1 1/2 courses each (pricier prawn/monkfish and a calamari to share, Coke/Wine) at 15 per head. If it weren't for the unbelievable, conversation-stopping racket, this place would get my five stars and I'd eat here nightly. A fantastic venue for lunch, when it's quieter, or for grabbing a quick bite with a mate when you've 'ad a few, super. But don't go their after a late afternoon's shop with your mum or aunt, like I did, because conversation will die... Clean lines, bare wood, stone floors, trestle tables and low celings create soundboxes; they look great, but amplify ambient sound. This is a neat trick - if people can't talk, they'll leave after eating. So you keep the tables turning... Interestingly, Wagamama and Cha Cha Moon have the same issues. Coincidence...?",

You get 2-3 skewers and the chicken has a really nice flavour. I also like this other dish consisting of meat wrapped in leaves. They put hot sauce and fish sauce on the table. It gets very busy especially in the evening but you can usually get a seat during lunch.I try to get a table near the window and in the summer they open up the shutters straight out on to the seat and watch the people go by whilst I enjoy my lunch.

I think the atmosphere of this restaurant is much more electric than the 'stuffy, business lunch' that can sometimes be present over on Bird Street. This restaurant adopts a no booking policy which means in busy periods, especially on the weekends, your queuing in the street. A brief shudder may of just come over you but fear not. Your not just queuing in any old street, your queuing in one of the busiest of Soho. Your getting dinner and a show! Where else can you que and wait for your hearty meal whilst watching the fashion elite, the resident transvestites and a massive gay movement of London. Turn to your left and you can start salivating and picking your dinner as fellow diners tuck in. The que usually moves quite quickly and once inside you can enjoy the hustle and bustle of a good Soho eatery. The architects, the fashion students, a few media savvies, one or two celebs, there's always a good mix in here and it's by far the best place in town for a good fill and some people watching.",

    "text": "Everyone who's ever eaten at Busaba Eathai has raved about it. I've been here once before and though the food was good I honestly didn't think it had anything special over any of the other myriad of Thai restaurants available at London so it has always puzzled me that the lines out the door can often go down the block and around the corner. Which is where it went just after we joined the line. On the night we went to the Wardour Street restaurant at about 7pm the line was fairly reasonable with about ten or so parties before us but it didn't take long before the line behind us had more than quadrupled. People are willing to wait though, a surprisng thing in hurried London, as the food is that good and in all honesty the turnover inside the restaurant is reasonble and the wait not that long - for us it was about half an hour. The restaurant is overwhelmingly buzzy and loud once you get inside. Its not exactly the kind of place which encourages intimate dining and dates. It is also communal style dining so you will definitely be sharing the table with others. Even in a group conversation is difficult and between the four of us we barely said a word at dinner it was that loud. Busaba is known for its speed, reasonable prices and consistent quality. The service was pretty good tonight - friendly and quick (once our waitress turned up.) Food arrived pretty quickly too which was pleasing. With drinks (not including service) the meal was \u00a315 each which isn't too bad for a main meal and shared starters. Surprisingly, or maybe not so surprisingly as its sister chain Wagamama does the same thing, service is not automatically added to the bill which makes a pleasant change. As food goes I guess its pretty good Thai though in all honesty nothing out of the ordinary. The options on the menu are fairly diverse with both typical and not so typical options. Service is also quick and friendly. My only objection is just how loud it gets in the restaurant which makes conversation really difficult. Go for a quick meal option.",

Ordered spring rolls, pandan chicken, a salad and prawns; luckily all was quite nice although they sent out 2 prawns by accident. Sent 1 back and they didn't appear on the bill. A few soup, noodle and rice options for mains and some weird curry combinations like duck massaman \u00a0very dark, not great. Why not just list all curries and let people choose which meat/vegetarian option they want? Waitress warned that all curries were really, really spicy which put me off venturing to the jungle curry that I had my eye on.Little bit expensive for what you get but would probably go back because of the atmosphere, location.

Their hot sake Kikumasamune is great if you're in a group.The first time I had their Thai Calamari, I was scarfing it down so eagerly, I almost blinded myself with the chopsticks! I've been here many times since, and have tried everything on the menu - the Pad see ew, Muslim beef curry and the Asparagus fried rice are my favourites.The restrooms are giggle-inducing - the male/female signs are just two ambiguous squiggles, so I waited for someone to exit one of the doors.

The sink extends into both restrooms, and lacks a divider near the bottom, so I could see male hands washing up on the other side - one of them went on to stick into the girls' side with an \"ooblegooglegoo!\". Real mature, boys.I want to give them a 4.5, because the operation is much like an assembly line, so they have no desserts. Head for Princi, right across the road!",

If they only served these three dishes, I would probably rate Busaba 5 stars.Contrary to what some of the other reviews have stated, I actually thought the service was sub par both times I've dined here. The restaurant is quite busy and it can be hard to flag down a server. However at the end of the day, it's really delicious and I definitely plan on coming back!",

Typical of all the other restaurants here, the interior is modern and dimly lit-- something I'm definitely not used to seeing in Thai restaurants. Seating here is odd-- there are bar-like seats by the window, and large, square tables filling the rest of the room. The larger tables are communal seating, which I'm not really into. We settled on the pad kwetio, something I've never seen on menus in the states. It was kind of like pad see-ew and pretty damn good. The portion size was pretty generous too. The bf got the red beef curry, which was also good, but a tad small. Overall, everything was reasonably priced and yummy enough to be worth the pretty pence we spent.",

Came here for lunch on a Friday, got a seat and within a few minutes the waitress came by asking for my order without welcoming me or introducing me to the place or asking about a drink. I ordered on the spot the Red Curry with beef and Thai Calamari on the side. The red curry came quickly, but the calamari and my drink never showed up. The waitress came by again to ask what I ordered and then still I didn't receive the water or calamari during my meal. Overall terrible service, upon asking for my bill I had to ask them to cancel the calamari, still never got a glass of water. The food had potential. I really enjoyed the spice level and flavor of the curry, but the beef quality was very poor, it was so chewy I could barely swallow. The restaurant didn't even try to right their wrong when the bill came round. I won't be back again.",

Second sign was that none of the traditional drinks that one would find in a Thai restaurant are on the menu -- there are several overpriced cocktails and fruit juice/tea concoctions.Ordered the som tom, pad kwetio, chili prawns, and a side of chinese broccoli. \u00a0Only the som tom approached the aromatic level of true Thai food (i.e., it stunk a little bit). The rest would be considered flavorful if I were to compare it to English cooking, but it was under-spiced compared to true Thai food. \u00a0I should be able to smell the seasoning and flavors, but none of that characteristic aroma was present.Overall, this place is a loud hang-out for hip, trendy, non-Asians. \u00a0Anyone looking for a true Thai food experience should keep on moving.

    "text": "3.5 stars. \u00a0Honestly, for a fusion place, I was veryVERY INCREDIBLY surprised. \u00a0For those who know me, I am quite critical of \"fusion\" food as I find it a cop out used by mediocre chefs to ignore the authenticity of ethnic food. \u00a0I'm glad that I came in with low expectations, because Busaba left me quite impressed!1) \u00a0Black peppercorn calamari. \u00a0Fantastic. \u00a0Again, I was apprehensive having learned that this dish was prepared without the tentacles ( guess because that tends to disturb some inexperienced eaters?). \u00a0However, the tastes and texture of this dish were phenomenal. \u00a0Covered in sesame, spices, and peppers to give just the right kick.2) \u00a0Pad thai. \u00a0Oh my gosh, I so did not want to order this. \u00a0I would never in my life order a Thai staple in a fusion restaurant. \u00a0But my friends are stubborn. \u00a0I am so glad to have tried this dish because it's given me faith in the quality of all other Busaba dishes. \u00a0The dish was not oily, the noodles were not too wet, and the peanut sauce was not grainy! \u00a0My main concerns assuaged! \u00a0In fact, I would go so far as to say I would order this again.3) \u00a0Butternut curry with a side of jasmine rice. \u00a0The rice was a bit dry, but this helped in soaking up the curry; so it was well planned. \u00a0The butternut was, like everything else, cooked just right; and as it had been marinating in the curry for quite some time, it easily picked up all the best aspects of the curry -- which was delish! \u00a0Thick and milky with a spice kick on the finish. \u00a0Loved it. \u00a0 A very simple dish with some great depth in the flavours.4) \u00a0Lemongrass tea. \u00a0When I ordered hot tea, I was honestly just expecting a run-of-the-mill jasmine blend. \u00a0The presentation of this drink is quite lovely, served up in it's own little pot (about 4 servings worth). \u00a0The lemongrass was sweet enough that the included honey was not necessary. \u00a0And the included cookies were a nice gesture (though a bit dry).Why only 3.5 stars? \u00a0-- There are sakes on the drink menu and a few non-thai dishes available for order. \u00a0I find this a bit incongruous. \u00a0Moreso with the sake, since it doesn't pair well with spicy Thai dishes in the first place.-- The coconut water isn't fresh. \u00a0If you're used to fresh coconut milk, this will disappoint you.-- They do not have any desserts here. \u00a0Why not? \u00a0Given the quality of the dishes I tried, I'd be willing to order mango sticky rice if it were an option. \u00a0It's also a Thai staple. \u00a0So what gives? \u00a0Busaba offers sticky rice and coconut rice (which show up in a lot of Thai desserts), so I was really surprised that they ignore desserts altogether.-- When it came time to pay, we were informed that the debit / credit system had been down for over a few hours (throughout Soho), and all the cash machines in the nearby area were also affected. \u00a0This was quite frustrating as our total party did not have enough cash to cover the bill and we were stuck retrying our cards for about 30 minutes until one of them finally went through. \u00a0In my opinion, as the machines were down when we first arrived, staff should have informed us of the issue up front to avoid what could have been a very bad situation.Extra info: \u00a0-- Group seating, so you share a rather large table with several other parties. \u00a0I love this type of style when eating Asian cuisine. \u00a0-- Hooks and nooks to store baby strollers, jackets, etc. \u00a0Super convenient.-- Plugs, so if you need emergency power for your iPhone, no worries. \u00a0^_^-- Funny symbols for the women's and men's bathrooms. \u00a0FYI, the \"squatting\" one is for women. \u00a0Haha. \u00a0Doors to the individual stalls are heavy, so don't get confused like me and mistakenly think they are all locked.",

It then took literally 15 minutes for a server to take my drink and order. The food came quickly. I ordered a papaya salad and chili prawn stir fry, with white rice on the side. After finishing my meal, it then took 25 minutes -- no joke -- to get the attention of a server to take my plates. After my table was cleared, it was another 10 minutes for the bill. The place had pretty much cleared out by then, so there was no excuse. In total I spent about hour just waiting for the attention of servers.",

The food is supposed to be Thai, but i would describe it as mixed Asian (meals range from Thai, to Malaysian to fusion).Prices are mid-range for main meals in London (around \u00a0\u00a36.50-\u00a312.30) food is brought out speedily, so good for a quick lunch-and-go option however don't expect too much in the way of getting any peronsalised service. Simplistic decor doesn't offer much in the way of a intimarte dining experience, most definately better for groups.",

I'm an American and yes, I may be pampered with overly attentive service and unnecessary amounts of food while dining but service here was outstanding for all the wrong reasons. I was with large party and our service was just slow and and the waitstaff inattentive. We had to hail our waiter several times because our drinks needed attention and the food just came out at different times. But the food was glorious. It was a huge break from the bland tasteless food our party had been subjected to while working out near Windsor. I loved my black pepper ostrich and the consensus around the table seemed to reflect that the food was pretty good. I thought the portions were just right but some at the table thought that the portions could have been bigger. If anything, I would recommend using the bathrooms here. The symbols for the bathroom are UHMAYZING! Just stand there and reflect on the simple beauty and hilarity of it all. I'm a little slow sometimes. I'm not gonna lie it took me longer than normal to figure out which symbol represented the designated area. I'll leave you with a pic. But if you are on that side of town I would recommend this place for a decent plate of food.",

It is not your plain old everyday curries and noodles... there is artistry to this food and it's so fab, in fact, I had two dishes (and appitizers). Yeah, I'm a cow, but in my defense, the portions are not as large as what I am used to in America. Seating is community style and it certainly makes for fascinating people watching. I'm not much of an oberver of random crowd behaviors, but Mark, my dinner companion who introduce me to this deliciousness, was absolutely fascinated. I wished I remembered what I had there, but alas I did not... I blame the fact that just prior to entering the establishment, I had tripped over a bike that had been tipped over and ended up on my arse in the most fantastical 10 point landing. The hostess was very concerned for my well being as was the nearly 50 some odd patrons who saw my performance through the huge glass windows (similar to a big screen plasma). What can I say? Nothing, other than that I'm a clutz and I'm glad I was able to provide some dinner entertainment. Will go back, despite the trauma.",

Thais that are not thai, chinese restaurant doing thai food, fusion-more-or-less-like-thai-but-believe-me-not. I found almost everything, but not the perfect thai. (Like the one in my hometown where they served food decorated with real flowers...aww)Just to be clear, Busaba Eathai is NOT the perfect thai. But is the thai you can visit almost regularly in the meanwhile your search for the perfect thai continues. The interior is dimly lit but the atmosphere is relaxed and somewhat refined. The menu is not huge but full of interesting dishes. Beverages are very original and well blended. I had a plate of chicken satay (one of my favourites thai foods) and it was well presented and well cooked. The peanut sauce was not so peanuty as I would loved it to be but it was tasty.Then I tried some ginger ostrich and the meat was very tender and very well seasoned with ginger.Also the Pat Tai Jay (wok rice noodles with vegetables) were well presented and tasty (I wasn't to impressed by the oily and spare tofu and the very very light aftertaste of burnt that apparently is so common everywhere except my fav thai in my hometown)We also tried the so famous calamari and they have held well their reputation, they were tasty and tender. At the end the bill was just right. So what can I say more about Busaba? That is really an OK place, if you wanna try it I don't think you will be disappointed.",

Another person I was with got the same amount of shrimp so it was intentional. The atmosphere is very nice. They have large tables to seat about 9 people so you get seated with other groups. That concept is okay for me but might be awkward for some.",

RIP Mr.crab.I picked from the pre-theatre menus, which was a side and a main for \u00a39.90, it was a complete bargain! I almost slapped the waiter when I found out how cheap it was.

We were seated quickly (be-warned the tables are sharing tables only so you are sat on a corner of a table of 8) however once sat were left waiting quite a long time to have our order taken. We both went for a Pad Thai and boy did it come quickly. Unfortunately it was COLD - not luke warm but FREEZING. We ate until we could grab a waiter, which also took quite a while, and told them it was cold. They took it away immediately with an apology and brought out a hot hot hot replacement quick enough so I have to give them some stars for the way they dealt with it. It isn't a bad Pad Thai but I have had better - not worth the aggro! It then took forever to get hold of someone to pay the bill. When we did get hold of them we then had to wait for it to be brought over and they put service charge on! Bloody cheek!",

We were both in the mood for some Thai food and were surprised with what we found!The people were working hard and it was very busy. They were really good about properly seating a lot of people in an area. We shared a table with a ton of people but the seating was such a way that it still felt very private. We had the chicken satay for an appetizer and it was perfect. The chicken was juicy and had a lovely flavor to it. Next came the asparagus fried rice with green curry and jungle curry. We were warned that the jungle curry was very spicy, but it turned out that the green curry was even spicier! I wasn't a fan of the green curry at all. I love green curry but this one just wasn't working with me, the spice was too strong and I couldn't enjoy it! But the asparagus fried rice was soooooo good! The dried tomatoes in it really hit the spot. Oh gosh, after I tried it I had wished I just ordered the chicken satay with the fried rice. So, all in all it was a great experience, very affordable and enough food. They didn't give us water, but I guess that's normal if you don't ask for it. My drink was tasty- Guava Bellini, and for the most part the food was very very good. The service was also top notch! You go busaba Eathai! I'd for sure come here again. German timeIch denke dieses Restaurant is am populaersten in London! Um 8:30 Uhr sind mein Freund und ich hier gehen. Es war eine grosse warte schlange aber war es schnell. Das essen war sehr gut aber war der grun curry ein bisschien zu scharf fur mich. Der Kellner war sehr schnell und freundlich. Die Preis ist gunstig und ich bin zufrieden!",

We ordered a morning glory to share and I ordered a seafood pad thai for myself. The morning glory was amazing -- I loved every bit of it including the freshness and the sauce. I appreciated my pad thai less. It was solid, but not much different from what you'd get elsewhere.Service was solid. We were seated in the far corner, so a bit off the servers' radar at times, but when serving, they were kind and prompt. Ambience was also good. More of a food court/chain feel than had expected, but relatively posh nonetheless. Overall, I might give it another try sometime but for now, three stars.",

Also tried the beef curry and crab fried rice - the curry was excellent, but the fried rice was nothing special.

The staff are very friendly and efficient but I don't think some of them really understand English. They asked three times if everything was alright and were told three times that the dishes were cold, but they just smiled and nodded and walked away. It is still a safe bet for a quick meal if you are out in Soho but I am not sure if it is really worth queuing for any more.",

I have been eating here at least once a week since it opened 10 years ago (Dang! how much money must I have spent). I have tried everything on the menu (honest troof). I love initiating Busaba virgins and watching as they become enlightened by the wonders taking place in their mouth. Listed below is a guaranteed palette pleasing fail-safe meal for the uninitiated.Sides (they don't call them starters)- Thai Calamari (People walk out of the restaurant if this isn't on the menu, it's that good)- Goong Tohd (Shrimp in batter - yeah I know that's nothing special but it's the mango dip that comes with it that will blow you away!)Noodles- Pad kwetio (If you're in the mood for noodles and like spice)- Rose apple stir-fry, Pat king talay or Chilli prawn stir-fry (all very easy on the tongue. Eat with Jasmine Rice)Curries- Green chicken curry, Jungle curry (Very spicy!), Muslim beef curry or Southern curry (the lamb in the latter can sometimes be a bit fatty).- The curries are best with Coconut or sticky rice.Drinks (Sorry I'm thorough!)- Homemade lemonade (So good you'll wish all swimming pools were filled with this)- Boylan cherry soda (nostalgic and very nice)Stay away from the following dishes: Prawn and yellow curry stir-fry, Fish cakes and Som tam salad. I don't know why they're still on the menu. They used to do a duck salad that was divine. Please ask your server to bring it back. Maybe if enough people ask for it they'll re-instate it.SIT, ORDER, ENJOY!",

    "text": "My goodness, this has to be one of my new found favourite restaurants in London. Thai food at its absolute best! I went a few nights ago and sampled the green curry and jasmine rice which was the best Thai meal I have ever tasted. The restaurant has a casual vibe and is perfect for grabbing a seat by the window and eating your meal whilst watching the people of Soho pass by. No one will notice if you are on your own as the seating layout makes it easy to do this without feeling isolated in that 'table for one' kind of manner.The best thing about the place (aside from the food of course), is the price. So cheap! They have really got the concept of serving great food at great prices right. You will leave very fulfilled!",

No sooner had we sat down there was a waiter at our elbows asking for our order! The staff were very friendly, even though we had come in very late. The tables are large and they squeeze you in where there's space, but it still manages to retain a fairly intimate atmosphere. The decor is chic and modern, with small, golden buddahs lined around the ceiling shelf and large windows that allow you to watch the world go by. When the food arrived (quickly) it was delicious, with rich flavours and fresh ingredients. I had the chicken and butternut squash stir-fry which had dried chillis and cashew nuts. All round good place, suitable for any party from friends and family to a date, and reasonably priced too! I'd go again.",

    "text": "Busaba is one of my favourite eats in London. I've yet to find a better place with a pad thai to rival and there is a lot of choice in London! I think the portions can be quite generous, depending on what you are eating, and the chicken satay comes with thick chunks of breast meat and nice substantial dipping sauce. There are some things can be a bit hit and miss, like the jungle curry, which the waiter said was 'rustic', which basically meant, lots of fat and gristle on the meat and some things like the ginger beef that are just divine. The Thai green curry could be spicer, but it could just be me and my liking for things hot, and the jasmine smoothie used to be my favourite drink there, but they seems to have altered the recipe a bit and it's more watery.If it's your first time, you can't go wrong with a stir-fried dish as they are all pretty nice, I think I've tried 80% of the menu, so it's a more than informed opinion though the rose-apple one is one you might steer clear of.. it's a bit weird having apple in a stir-fry! I like the solid wood and the windows that open out unto the street and if the Busaba in Soho is crowded.. don't bother queueing, there is one just off Oxford Street near Gap and it's just as nice and a bigger restaurant. I have never had to queue for very long if ever there.",

    "text": "Busaba Eathai is an extremely popular Thai restuarant in Soho, sometimes too popular. If you turn up close to, or on a weekend, you will be waiting a long time in the queue. Once I found myself so far back in the queue that I eventually realised that I was standing in the smokers section of the pub next door - the two groups had merged. Needless to say, I got back into the correct queue. Once you are in the restaurant I would advise you to choose fast and order quick because your waiter will be rushed off his or her feet, and you are not ready to order, you may not see service again for a while. Also bare in mind that this is a very noisy place, and you have to practically shout to hear yourself or your dinner companions. If you are going for safe bets, the green, red or yellow curries are substantial and very tasty. A great side is the crispy squid, which was far larger than I would have expected and could almost have been a main. The chicken parcels which come on banana leaves are also very good.Desserts are kind of left out on this menu, but people don't come here looking for puddings - usually this place is a pit stop en route to Soho watering holes. A little interesting side note - I met a lady in the toilets who used to work here and she said that the food was marginally better in the Russell Street branch.",

We waited in the line outside for about 20 minutes before they ushered us in and seated us at a table with two other groups. The service was quick and friendly, and we got our food within another 20 minutes (thought we were so hungry that it seemed like 20 hours). I ordered the chicken noodle dish with Chinese broccoli. It wasn't what I was expecting -- the noodles were very thin and dry -- but it was delicious. My friends' dishes were also amazing, and I think I liked the beef noodle soup dish the most. Make sure you try the iced green tea -- it comes in a packaged bottle, but it goes perfectly with Thai food. I'll definitely be back if I'm hit with another Thai food craving before I leave London.",

It is the only place in London where there is always a huge queue waiting to enter outside, so you can wait for around 20-30min outside easily. Once you get it, you are placed on any table where there are seats, and most likely you will be sharing the food with strangers, unless you get one of the seats that face the outside window. This is one of the aspects (sharing your table with strangers) that people find charming about this place, and other people really dislike. The food is great, even if you are not so much into exotic food, so I would always give it a try. It is different, and I do recommend it.",

I was introduced to Busaba right when I first moved to London and quickly made it one of my go-to spots in Soho. It's one of the few places I've found in London where I don't feel screwed when I get the bill. For instance, tonight I had a starter (Thai calamari), main (Pad Thai) and tea which set me back \u00a317 when it was all said and done. Super convenient for a late dinner after happy hour or just before going out. I recommend hitting it up either before 7pm or after 9:30pm as it gets real busy real quick. The whole no reservations thing means that people queue outside down Wardour. I think I waited about an hour once one long Saturday evening when I was absolutely determined to eat there. Service is good...nothing to write home about....but friendly and quick...and the atmosphere is quite nice once you're settled down at a table surrounded by strangers.Now to the food. I've ordered the Thai calamari just about every time I come to Busaba. It can be quite filling though so I'd recommend sharing. Then I generally go for one of the one of the Pad Thai-esque dishes which are always very good. I tried some of a mate's duck/broccoli tonight and that was good as well...and if you order something which requires rice, get the coconut rice or else you'll be hating yourself (along with me) for not doing so later.",

One thing to note about this place is that the food comes out as soon as it is ready so do not expect the starters to come out first. \u00a0My friend sat there with Pad Thai rapidly cooling on the table while we had our appetizers of vegetable spring rolls, roti, and soft shell crab. \u00a0In their defense they do warn you that this would happen when we ordered. I ended up with the chicken butternut squash and it was pretty good with a nice little spice finish to each bite. \u00a0This dish along with the roti is what gave the place an additional star. \u00a0The most disappointing was the soft shell crab. \u00a0Soggy would be too harsh but the batter was soft and bland for lack of a better way to put it. \u00a0The sauce that came with it was overpowering with spice and salt. \u00a0At that point I could have dipped a napkin in the sauce and it would have been nearly the same. \u00a0All said and done it's mediocre Thai food.

You do have to ask for this menu though, it isn't given it to you otherwise, and it is limited. I have to say, I was not into any of the stuff we tried. I didn't like the pad thai that much as it was too sweet for me and I really missed my regular order of pad kwetio. I also could not deal with the calamari texture, but my friend was quite happy to eat it. We had the chicken satay sticks with peanut sauce which was a bit bland unless you really cover it with sauce. I had the ginger beef which came with rice and was decent, but nothing really felt above average to me. Usually, when I order pad kwetio, I am super happy and obsessing over Busaba for a few days. I would come back and try something else I think, perhaps you just have to find the dish that works for you. The restaurant itself is nice. There is shared seating and much needed place to hang your coats on the side. Going to the bathroom, I am always surprised by how heavy the doors are. The lighting is nice, not too dark, not too bright and I enjoy being here.",

It also meant that I was ignored by the waiting staff who weren't interested in my request for a beer. The food was ok but nothing special compared with other venues in London.

If only there was someone else fanning me with leaves, I would have thought that I was royalty. Oh Wait, it wasn't a dream. I was actually in a hot building sweating through the pores of my face and back due to lack of ventilation. I was at Busaba Eathai. Despite the restaurant having no cooling system except for a couple of fans in the ceiling which rotate ever so slowly, I enjoyed my time here. I ordered their homemade lemonade which was good and not too sugary but part of me feels like a few drops of bottled lemon was poured in there due to the slightly acidic and unnatural taste. Or maybe that's just the way they make it. After that, during meals, I quite enjoyed their Guava Bellini (Prosecco, guava, strawberry) and ended my night with a glass their 2014 Sauvignon Blanc Villa Montes which I quite liked taking into consideration my picky-ness with wine.For main, which I dived right into, I had their Duck Breast in Chinese Broccoli and Taramind Sauce which was like ... WOAH! Hold on, is this taste real?! I loved it! The tenderness of the duck breast accompanied by well cooked broccoli and a Taramind sauce I want to go hunting for. As sides, I opted for their Phad Phak which, with the crunchiness of the cashews and pine nuts, complimented the Duck dish very well. Low carb meal, you say?! YEAH! If you have been to Wagamama before, you will see some similarities but I prefer Busaba. I would go again and hope that their air cooling system works, if they have one in this location!",

    "text": "Friend and I were in the area craving for Thai food and came in for an early dinner and really just beat the dinner rush at around 5pm. By the time we were seated there was a bit of a queue outside. Loved the interior of the restaurant; really pretty, modern, and sleek compared to any other Thai hole in the wall joint I've ever visited. The communal tables made me kinda go 'eeeek' inside. But after being seated, the concept really works. The tables are huge enough that rubbing elbows and overhearing conversations isn't even an issue. Like the piggies we are, my friend and I ordered four plates to share between the two of us.-Som Tam: Our server wasn't kidding when he mentioned that this papaya salad is HOT. The little dish of grated green papaya, dried shrimp and cherry tomatoes looks unassuming enough, but the sauce they use packs a huge punch. As much as I enjoy spicy food, I was in pain eating this. In the best possible way.-Mussaman Duck Curry: Very different, but very delicious! I've never had a duck curry before this, but now I've gotta say I'm a fan. The duck was super tender and the flavor of the curry was unique to other Thai curries I've tried. A little more gritty in texture and much more earthy in flavor. Don't forget the sticky rice with this! -Sen Chan Pad Thai: Reallyyyy good pad thai. Worth splurging on the extra \u00a31 or so for the crabmeat, they're pretty generous about it! The flavors were nice and the noodles were perfect. Definitely one of the better pad thai I've had. -Spicy, Sweet & Sour Fish: The skin was crispy while the inside meat was still moist, and it came served in a sweet and sour sauce topped with chiles. As hot as this dish appeared, the chilies didn't pack a punch like the papaya salad did and my tastebuds said thanks! Definitely worth ordering if you're a fish fan like me. While the food is excellent, service on the other hand is kind of lacking. While they are extremely efficient at getting you into the restaurant, seated, and ordered, it seems that once the food arrives to the table that we become forgotten about. It took us a long time to flag someone down to get our check, and don't even think about trying to get a refill on your water. A few bites into that inferno of a papaya salad, and my water was already gone with no refill in sight. Should have ordered a beer instead!",

It's crack cephalopod, and one order is never enough. If you don't like the squid then you are destined to live a souless unhappy life!All the Thai staples are there, servings are just beyond tapas size, and in general I reckon one dish, the calamari (obviously) and a bowl of rice will see you through. Oh, and the duck is also sublime! No desserts, have never seen anyone have a coffee, and they do usher you out kind of quick. But if you want to have a quick, tasty meal in the centre of London, then this is a great choice, just make sure you have two portions of calamari!!.",

There's dark wood everywhere, which keeps it warm in the Winter - but cool in Summer (they also open up the front windows so try and get a space by the front of the restaurant if it's hot). It does get crazy busy in the evening and weekends, you'll regularly\u00a330 for two for a main, side to share and soft drinks.

We initially ordered the 'soyari' (the vegan version of their calamari), the drunken seafood noodles and soft shell crab fried rice - all of which we were very excited for. However, when we received the pad Thai, we found it bland and a bit lacking in depth. As we informed our server and requested a different dish, she was very accommodating and helpful. We ended up getting the seafood curry instead which was very flavourful and rich. (The server did mention after that the Pad Thai is more 'neutral' and light, so perhaps that explains our experience. )Other than the pad Thai, the soymari was pretty good (which the portion was slightly larger for ~\u00a37), the rice was very flavourful and curry was delicious. All in all, we spent around \u00a341, for the appetizer, fried rice, seafood curry (new dish) and coconut rice. I would definitely return just for the service, but also because I would love to try out the rest of the menu. Would definitely recommend!",

    "text": "For our last night in London, we were hanging out in Piccadilly Circus and looking for some good Thai food. The positive reviews ended up leading us to Busaba. While it isn't located directly in Piccadilly Circus, it was a short walk and easy to find. We were there for a later dinner and were sat without having to wait. Unfortunately, the only real negative about our experience is the communal seating. The dining room has many large tables and benches and if you are a small party, you share the tables with other people. I really don't care to eat like that. Luckily, some of the groups were finishing up and we had some breathing room after a few minutes. We tried the Bang-Kick Prawns for an appetizer and they were great. They weren't overly spicy, but did have a good kick of flavor. For my entree, I had the Sweet & Sour Chicken and my wife had the Black Pepper Beef. Our food was served quickly and both entrees were delicious. Pay attention to the spicy ratings on the dishes. My wife's was rated pretty low on the spicy scale and it was definitely more than we expected (still great though). The serving size was about right, but we didn't realize that side items are ala carte. Had I known, I would have ordered some rice or something to go along with it.The food and service were great and the prices were very reasonable. I probably would have rated this place a four, but my wife raved about how much she loved it. She said it was the best Thai she had ever had, so I guess that deserves a 5 star rating.",

However the food (chicken pad thai and classic pad thai) was pretty tasteless, and the \"sriracha\" sauce they had on the table also had little to no flavour. It would be better if we could customize spice levels as well to add some flavour and appeal to a larger demographic. The communal seating may be a bit awkward when crowded, and the restaurant layout was not the best as people will be constantly be walking behind you and hitting you in the back with their bags/elbows. I would not recommend Busaba as your first choice if you're looking for legitimate Thai food in London.",

One has to queue in order to dine in this restaurant, but it was well worth the wait.The restaurant is relatively spacious with rows of communal tables and Buddha images everywhere as the main motif, we opted for the set dinner menu that comes with appetizer and main entr\u00e9e. I started with a small plate of fish cakes with cucumber and peanut sauce relish while I selected Ginger beef stir fry with Thai pepper, chili, onion served over Jasmine rice for my main. it was delicious, well portioned and good paired with a cold bottle of Thai beer. the customer service is awesome they do their best to accommodate the clients as soon as possible.

Started with the calamari and it was ok...well prepared but missing something so I added Sriracha and it boosted the flavour ten fold. I then asked for Asian greens and the chicken satay....whoops. The satay was missing a peanut taste to it and the greens were so wet and soggy. My friend ordered dry sweet potato fries...dry as the Sahara dry. Also the Pad Thai and she hated it. The jumbo shrimp were cocktail shrimp and it tasted like no care was put into it. I will give it a second go ONLY because of the staff. They were quite attentive and all smiled save for our first one who was grumpy...the rest made up for it. A special thank you to the serving staff and especially the young lad from Colombia (we had an opportunity to chat) he was tops and so kind. They did well in choosing the service staff...if only their kitchen staff cared just as much. Give it a try...it could of been an off night when I went.",

I assume the curry base was made ahead of time and the meat was cooked separately and added in when ordered (understandable, but they need to curry up that chicken)The crab fried rice had no \"wok air\". If you don't know what that is, it's the flavor you get in most Asian food cooked in a wok. Food that is cooked with extreme heat and fast speed has \"wok air\" Their fried rice is something you can cook on your weak stove at home.Chicken Satay was odd, once again, chicken was flavorless, so the initial bite give you a great smoky flavor, but once that was gone it was like chewing on an eraser, the peanut sauce lacked peanuts which is a crime.",

Don't be put off by the queues, it goes quickly, but if you hate queues, try going at lunch.Busaba Eethai have taken Thai food and added a modern taste, but it is still delicious. All in all, it is reasonably priced. I have only ever been here with my girlfriend and her sister, they happen to be experts in here, and the last time we went, I had grilled duck with tamarind sauce, chicken wings, spicy mixed seafood and the coconut prawn curry, then finish off with a honey and ginger tea, well, I wouldnt have ordered that to finish off, but it did come with a buiscuit!! and it was a great way to digest.It is a great place to go after work with the work mates or friends, the service is attentive, but you sometimes dine in a shared dining room and table, which can get awkward in a private conversation, but the plus is you get to meet people. The only downside to this restaurant is that you can't book, so if you do go, prepare for a queue that moves swifly, and prepare for a great meal!",

We happened to run into it after record shopping and it wasn't crowded. Judging by the other reviews for this place, that was fortuitous. Service was very cordial and prompt. There are low slung square community tables throughout the restaurant, so this isn't a place for a private, intimate conversation. Food was excellent. We had a green curry chicken which was traditional curry with a different variety of veggies which was a nice surprise. The spring rolls were small, almost lumpia-esque. Very good, and the pad thai was very flavorful and the noodles were cooked perfectly al-dente. Following our meal we had a pot of lemongrass tea served in demitasse cups with a small silver pot of honey and some buttery shortbread biscuits. It definitely lived up to the recommendations and was a great way to end an afternoon in Soho.P.S. Check out the loo downstairs, it's quite nice. \u00a0I don't know if it was because I drank too much, but I could not figure out the symbols on the doors and I almost walked into the men's room. \u00a0The sinks between the bathrooms connect (like the Standard in DTLA), so if you're cheeky you can stick your hand through to the other side. \u00a0Not that I did that or anything...",

The food was a little overpriced but a great menu and now they have opened one in Shoreditch I imagine it'll be up there with Wagamama in no time!

Not amazing, but good, and there are definitely standout dishes as well as some disappointing ones.The thai calamari are fantastic, not chewy and spicy and overall tasty. The Som Tam green papaya salad was good, not great and a definitely a little more bland than I have had it before, but overall a good starter.All green curries are to be recommended, I specifically like the chicken one. Paired with coconut or sticky rice it is sweet, spicy and simply good. The Massaman curry and Pad Thai were good, again a little bland with something missing but good enough. The Jungle curry, on the other hand, was NOT good, we were actually rather disappointed. It tasted like burnt barbecue, a little like over-chargrilled meat with an odd aftertaste, I basically only had a couple of bites and the boyfriend finished it (he was too hungry to leave it!)Price - rather high for what you get, and the general atmosphere and hustle out the door once you're done. We ended up leaving over \u00a350 for dinner for two and a couple of beers each, which the food is just not really good enough for.One other great drawback - there are no desserts. None. There are some amazing Thai desserts that go wonderfully after a spicy curry or soup, and there are none on the menu, leaving the experience rather unfinished if, like me, a little sweet bite after dinner is a must.So overall rather good food if you're craving thai, a little overpriced but with some fantastic dishes.",

I've no error bars on that result though) and not too pricey for this 'hood. While you'll likely be sharing a table with strangers, the seating's spaced out enough that you won't have to listen to them chew.

You can't book in advance unless you're part of a big (12+ group) though they always do their best to accommodate groups. Once inside, service is usually very quick. The toilets, located downstairs, once gave me a fright. I was washing my hands and suddenly someone behind the sink grabbed them! It was a drunk woman in the girls loo!!

    "text": "We stopped in here while roaming Soho for dinner. We got seated almost immediately around 930 and it was still very busy. We had the spring rolls, pad Thai (with crab), duck curry, fried chicken, basil beef and green curry chicken. I have had green curry in a lot of places and this one topped them all by a long shot. Overall the food was fantastic and the service was great. We are a very picky group so always good when we can find reasonably cheap eats that please everyone. Only thing that kinda shocked us was the spice level in the green curry and pad Thai. It was perfect but may be a bit too spicy for some.",

The cafeteria style, bench seating is not always to my liking, and is very \"Wagamama\", but it is good enough.The ambience, service, food and drinks are all to a decent standard. If you have eaten with me in a place such as this... you know that I always attack any calamari dish with gusto. It is a good test of a restaurant... is the squid stringy? Tough? Rubbery? Well, at Busaba, they can nail it. Bonus!It is not the most regular of places for me to visit but nonetheless, I'm sure I will return here soon.",

If you don't like Thai food - you should go there as they will change your mind about it (or at least you will dislike a little less!).The service is outstanding - especially given how busy it gets in the evenings. The best time to get there is about 6-6.30pm, as it is not empty already, but it's not yet too full so that you'll be queuing outside.It's best to go there with a few people and order many things - because you would want to try everything once you try at least one dish from there.Their selection of juices with coconut water is amazing - I love mixing up some quirky ingredients!I would strongly recommend this place for seafood lovers - we ordered a melange of seafood, squid and prawns (three dishes) and all three were outstanding and very different in taste! Definitely stay away from rice though - simply, because you would want to keep your belly free for some nicely cooked veggies and proper meat!",

You may have to wait a while for a table, but this restraunt is fun time for a night out with good food and a really excellent setup. This being said, London is the curry capital of the western world, and if you are seeking this enigmatic dish, there are much more affordable options with an authentic feel. I would suggest Tayyabs or Needoo Grill.",

In fact, I think many tables in this establishment is shared.The decor and ambiance were nice.... although the place can get a little loud and rowdy.I ordered the Green Curry Fried Rice with Green Curry Chicken. The fried rice and the chicken were both spicy. The curry had the perfect amount of gravy and the chicken was grilled before cooked in curry. My only complaint is the lack of vegetables. The dish literally came with fried rice and the chicken.... Nothing else. The rice was not fried with anything aside from green curry paste.Overall, I thought this place was above average. It wasn't too expensive for the area and the food was above average.... Definitely a place worth visiting again when back in the area.",

The decor, the incense, the big buddah at the door, the family style seating -- and I haven't even gotten to the food yet!I ordered the Sen Chan Pad Thai -- which comes with crabmeat and mango. It was delicious and perfectly spicy. Best pad thai I have had in a long time and was so surprised to find it in the SoHo of London during my visit there last week. We also shared the Thai Calamari which was awesome! I, of course, took nibbles of my friend's dishes as well and the curry and regular pad thai was excellent. Just really interesting flavor combos, fresh ingredients, and good service too. Overall, delicious food and I actually enjoyed the communal dining, although a bit uncomfortable at first, but it really creates a cool vibe when the food, and most importantly, wine comes out! Also - I think this is a chain or there are multiple locations because I also saw this restaurant at a mall I went to.",

Two is perfect, three is fine, four is pushing it. The wait staff was fast getting our orders but never came to collect the check. We sat talking and waiting for more than 15 minutes. Finally we got up to leave to see if someone would take the check. No one cared, so we had to go up to the cashier and then still no one wanted to take the check. We had to ask three times before someone would take the check. Wow.",

Seems easy enough, especially after asking the server to double check our order before leaving.Turned out... our pad thai had prawns (they are so small you wouldn't notice until it was too late)... our chicken satay had the worst sauce, with chunks of peanuts and the taste of flowers. Both were so, so flavorless in comparison to any Thai dish we've ever had.-1 star for getting our order wrong-2 stars for how bland and unsatisfying it tasted-1 star for the service being slow and with attitude=1 star for feeding us, I guessBy far the most unsatisfying meal we've ever had in London. which is most disappointing because of the great reviews it has.

However, every time I come away disappointed. I'm unsure if I keep ordering the wrong thing or I'm just biased by experiences of thai food in Thailand, but for some reason, it just never really hits the spot. That being said, the service is very quick, there are multiple locations, it's always a decent meal, and it's great for big groups. Additionally, the salt and pepper squid starter is actually quite good! I would recommend (and have recommended) this place to people looking for decent thai food before a show or someone who wants something quick and easy, but if you're looking for top-class thai food, I would move on.",

    "text": "We visited London last week and doing the usual: walking around all day and waiting until we were starving before really looking for somewhere to eat, resulting in some rumbling tummies and some speedy yelping!We were around the Oxford St. area so decided to head towards Soho. After reading some good reviews we decided on Busaba Eathai.It was quite hard to find this place even though we had looked on a map. The main reason was because the typography is terrible on the signage and barely legible. Secondly because the canopy hangs so low it covers most said signage. Inside was nice though, with dark earthy coloured wood. The staff were really friendly and service was extremely quick. I cannot believe how quick the food came. I ordered the seafood ramen and the boy had spicy prawn rice with roti bread. My ramen was nice but there could have been a bit more favour and I added more spice. The prawns were good but there wasn't much more seafood. The rice was really nice and part of me wishes I had ordered that. The roti was ok, a little bit on the greasy side. We ordered the calamari on recommendation of another yelper and I am glad we did, it was very tasty, though the soy sauce available was very salty (maybe I am used to using my own low salt sauces?)It was good for a quick feed, but not a nice relaxed meal, as everything feels like a huge rush to get you in and out which was a shame, especially as it was only a Wednesday.We enjoyed this restaurant but would be more inclined to try somewhere else next time we're in London.",

But we had to order two plates of food which made the dinner fairly expensive. It was worth it. We also had the jungle chicken and it wasn't as rich and creamy as I would have hoped, bit watery, but tasted fine. 4 stars because the portions were small and the service was really slow.",

There is a nice selection of juices and the place is vegan friendly with designations on the menu. In the past I've had the curry and spicy noodles and it was very nice. Stir fry is quite good with a mix of spice, sweet and smoky flavors. I was a little disappointed in the wings as a side dish. They were deep fried and not spiced at all as far as I could tell - a little strange actually. If you go in the summer, be prepared to wait in line, but its a friendly atmosphere as its just on the really active edge of SOHO. Also, the seating is low and at communal tables - which is kind of cool.",

    "text": "This place was very strange. The service was poor - when we (party of 2) arrived, there were several people milling about the front, but no maitre d' stand or anyone taking names. There were also many seats available in the dining room. Eventually someone came by and sat everyone. The tables are large - about 8 or 10 people - and are meant to be shared. Which was fine until the couple to our left was on an incredibly awkward first or second date, and the one member of the group of young women to our right sat way too close to me. Obviously this is not the restaurant's fault, but it was their fault that it took 20 minutes for anyone to come by to take a drink order. By this point, we just ordered our food (2 mains and 1 starter to share) because we anticipated another long wait. Thirty-five minutes later, our starter came out, and we enquired as to the whereabouts of our drinks. About three minutes later, before we had even eaten half of the starter, our main courses appeared. And we asked again about our drinks. A few minutes later, they finally appeared. The food was rather bland; I expect Thai food to be very flavourful. We started out with fish cakes. I had one bite and couldn't eat anymore. The texture just wasn't for me, but my boyfriend \"didn't mind\" them and had a few. For my main, I had pad thai, which was alright, but I've had better from the frozen section of the grocery store and a little added peanut butter. My boyfriend had a curry dish, which was completely forgettable. Luckily, there was some sriracha on the table, so we were able to spice up the food, but when I go out to eat - especially for Thai - I expect the food to be cooked well enough to not need to add any hot sauce. When we finished, our plates were taken rather quickly, but we had to wait another 30 minutes for our bill. It's worth noting that there were several empty seats in the restaurant, and several employees standing around rather idly. We also didn't have one consistent server, like you would at most establishments, which I found strange. Uniform tops could also stand to be \u00a0few inches longer.",

I'll keep this short, the calamari was genuinely amazing, I've never tasted anything as good. However the Duck was literally (I can't emphasise this enough) like eating a shoe. It was tough and honestly tasted like a cross between leather and a welly. It was too noisy for me and I dislike sharing tables but this is only a personal thing. Service was fairly good, however it was difficult to get someones attention for the bill. I tried the pad thai my friend was eating and that was also very good so I maybe just chose badly with the duck.",

    "text": "Before heading to London this past January, I did my culinary recon via intense online researching and through friends and family of mine who reside in and around London. On more then one occasion did this restaurant come up, so I had to make it a point to stop in. \u00a0 Busaba Eathai has three locations in London, the one I hit up was the location off Wardour Street a 10 minute walk from Oxford Circus. I can honestly say that this restaurant boasts some of the best Thai food I have ever consumed. Approaching the restaurant on a Saturday night, the side street it's located on is rather calm. I was definitely surprised to walk in and find the restaurant buzzing with locals and tourists alike. The d\u00e9cor is a deep wood theme which carries through the walls, tables, and even chopsticks. Definitely one of the sleeker Thai restaurants I have been in. Having binged out at Borough Market all day, my companions and I were not deathly starving, so we decided to skip out on salads and soups and head straight for the mains. We did however order one app which the waitress recommended to us. The side was called Pandan chicken, it consisted of chicken with garlic and coriander root, wrapped in a pandan leaf. Great presentation on this dish and the flavours of garlic, coriander, and pandan were sealed into the chicken via the neatly wrapped leaf. \u00a0For mains, we ordered the Pad Thai Jay - rice noodle with shitake, tofu, baby corn, french bean, peanut, bean sprout, and lime. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the assortment of vegetables created a successful medley of flavours, great vegetarian dish. Next on the list was crab meat egg fried rice with spring onion, the rice was moist and screaming flavour, the crab meat, egg and onions formed a deadly threesome. Last was the cream of the crop, the lamb red curry with lychee and cherry tomato. This was definitely one of the best Thai curry dishes I have ever had. The red curry was so sweet, and the lamb was falling apart. The lychee really rounded out the flavour for me and after we finished eating the dish and licking the bowl dry, I could have ordered it again. \u00a0 \u00a0I will warn you that Basuba is known for its long queues and busy atmosphere due to the restaurant being so popular. Many of the tables are square seating up to 10 ppl, so you may very well find yourself eating besides complete strangers, to me this is no problem but some may find this offsetting. As far as pricing goes, I don't believe there are any dishes over $10. Typically in London prices for quality foreign food is extravagant, but Busaba's is very reasonably priced making this a more affordable venue to eat at. I can not vouch that you will find fully traditional authentic Thai dishes here, but you will find many of them with chic modern twists that work. Why do they work so well? ALAN YAU directs the restaurant, he is a highly successful restauranteur who's restaurants have attained Michelin starts, and his Dim Sum restaurant Hakkasan in the Soho district took the 18th spot in the magazine Restaurant's Top 50 restaurants (08'). Alan knows what works, trust me.",

    "text": "My co-worker in London described this place as the McDonald's of Thai food. \u00a0I wasn't sure how to take that because I love Sausage McMuffins and they have the best fries. \u00a0Everything else in between is eh. \u00a0Even with that we ventured forwarded with the assumption that this wasn't the most authentic of Thai joints. \u00a0We passed by this place the other day and it was crowded, long lines out the door. \u00a0I'm not sure how I feel about community tables. \u00a0The amount of Siracha I use should allow me not to have to share it with some wanker across the table who isn't putting the bottle back into the middle. \u00a0The menu was pretty limited and definitely lacked some of the dishes I've come to enjoy like chinese brocoli with crispy pork, mee krob and some of the soups. \u00a0Anyway we ordered an obscene amount of food as usual. \u00a0The best dishes were pad see ew, chicken satay (thick pieces not on skewers) and the crab fried rice. \u00a0The fried rice was easily one of the best fried rice dishes I've had outside of DTF. \u00a0The pad see ew was mixed with lots of different types of seafood and pretty good but they had the wrong type of noodles. \u00a0Pad see ew noodles are usually the thick flat rice noodles but this version used noodles you'd more commonly find in ramen. \u00a0Big error. \u00a0When the chicken satay is one of the best dishes of the night (ordered 8 total) then something is amiss. \u00a0One of my work friends isn't as adventurous and wanted to pick a safety dish alongside the noodle and rice dishes which I know he loves. \u00a0The spicy prawns and jungle curry were mediocre at best. \u00a0The curry was spicy but a bit oily and something about the flavor was off. \u00a0The papaya salad lacked punch and flavors. \u00a0A lot of people from the US on the board should come out to LA so I can take them to some bomb ass authentic Thai in Hollywood. \u00a0I have some stuff that will knock your socks off.",

    "text": "Don't be put out by the queue outside, the short wait is really worth it! Busaba delivers amazing tha\u00ef food for a small price in a convivial and busy environment.Staff is always very attentive and nice and sharing your table makes the experience relaxed and unfussy. From the rich Muslim curry to the spicy basil prawns or the green curry fried rice with chargrilled chicken, every dish I've ever tasted has delivered on great flavours. I even love the ginger and peppercorn calamaris even though I don't really like them normally.The only small downfall is on the wine selection as I find it a bit reductive and not always tasty.Otherwise, this is definitely THE place to share a meal before going out in the West End!",

    "text": "ok yes this place is good and very popular. \u00a0but i think people hype it up way more than it needs. \u00a0i enjoyed my curry and it was decently priced for a nice restaurant. \u00a0i like how they have really large tables.my only beef is that the service wasn't that great when i went. \u00a0when you serve spicy food you should probably give more than a toddler size cup of water..and when someone needs more..they shouldn't have to ask 3 times.but yeah overall meal was good. \u00a0i just relaly don't like when people don't give me water.",

If you go please order the amazing Thai squid, I swear by them. Also the duck curry is so delectable and full of flavor and it goes perfectly well with the coconut rice. If you go with a big group you might wait a while for your table so be aware of that. But be patient its worth it. The price for your dinner will be so incredibly cheap for the quality of food you'll be skipping down Wordour Street like I did last night.",

    "text": "My friend and I had dinner at Busaba Eathai, and the place was packed. That was a good sign that the food was good. We ordered the grilled aubergine salad, prawn pad thai, monk fish curry, and chicken satay to share, and we left no plate unturned. Because the place is so popular and the way the space was designed (informal seating), we found ourselves yelling in order to be able to hear each other. After filling our stomachs, we wanted to sit and chat for a bit more, but I think the waiter was trying to shoo us (a dinner line was forming outside, and getting longer by the minute). I think this only becomes an issue during peak hours like lunch and dinner, though. However, despite all this, the food was excellent, and my friend and I both left the restaurant satisfied and pleased.",

Servings aren't huge, but the quality is outstanding - Busaba boasts the best calamari in town.Their \"no booking\" policy means there are usually queues on Fridays and Saturdays, and staff are sometimes a bit frantic, but believe me, it's worth it. Oh, and it boasts one of the most fabulous bathroom sinks in London.",
