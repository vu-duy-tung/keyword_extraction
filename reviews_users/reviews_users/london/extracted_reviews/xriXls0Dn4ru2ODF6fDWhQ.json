The chicken was delicious, soft from being poached and covered in a creamy nut sauce despite being the spiciest of the five dishes. The crunchy Green Beans were a second favourite disappearing almost immediately while a few Spare Ribs went back to the kitchen as they were a bit too fatty to eat the whole portion. Sichuan-Folk Twice Cooked Pork \u00a0\u00a36.90We loved this dish of sticky belly pork, sliced thinly with chewy caramel-like frazzled fat. The pork came with some vegetables and soft pillow pancakes to wrap the pork and soak up the delicious sauce. Fish-Fragrant Sea Bass \u00a0\u00a313.80This dish was left until last which was a big mistake. The intense heat of frying the fish had curled it so the tail nearly almost touched it's mouth, by the time we got through the pork the fish had drooped and lost it's crispiness. However it was still moist with a thick sticky coating. Fish-fragrant flavor is one of Sichuans famous 23 flavours as Fuchsia Dunlop explains in her Land Of Plenty based on the seasonings used in traditional fish cookery, this flavor combines salty, sweet, sour and spicy notes, with the heady fragrance of garlic, ginger and scallions. The core seasoning is pickled red chilies, either on their own or mixed with fava beans in Sichuanese chili bean paste, which give fish-fragrant dishes their distinctive orange-red hue Drink4 Tsing Tao beers AtmosphereAlmost empty when we ate (10.30pm) but the helpful manager livened up the room with his enthusiasm in helping us choose our dishes.

    "text": "Sooo... I am undecided about this place. It has much nicer decor than other cheapn cheerful sichuan places that I have been to such as Gourmet San. But, and it's a big but, the food at Gourmet San was much nicer. Now I don't know if this was just a result of bad ordering (the restaurant was full of chinese people having a great time) but we're not very familiar with sichuan food and ended up with a load of gloopy, cornstarchy dishes. Which is a shame as we asked the waiter to talk us through but he just recommeded pretty much everything which wasn't that helpful. We ended up going by the pictures and taking pot luck. The couple of dishes that were more authentic tasting were really nice (the dry fried green beans and the twice cooked pork) it's just unfortunate that not everything on the menu is like that. I would go back but beware it gets very busy and the service really tailed off towards the end (we waited ages for our bill).",

    "text": "I was invited to join some friends for dinner here. \u00a0I was told it was highly recommended, and had \"very spicy\" food. \u00a0I have to admit that I was worried. Even though I'm part Mexican, and I love places like Lahore Kebab House, I thought this might be the \"spicy\" that pushes me over the top. \u00a0(I've even been to that place in the Mission district in San Francisco that has the tingly mouth-numbing lamb dish - Mission Chinese Food.) \u00a0It turns out I didn't have anything to worry about. Even though all the food was very, very flavourful, it was not too spicy at all. We happened to eat here on the hottest day of the year, but they had a nice strong air conditioner in the back, keeping the entire restaurant at a very comfortable temperature. \u00a0Another good sign was that there was a large group of people at a table, all speaking Mandarin, having a great time.We decided to let my friend order anything he wanted, and it turned out to be a great way to go, as I didn't have to order based on any preconception. \u00a0We just ended up with a wide sample of what they had to offer. \u00a0We had pork, dumplings, jellyfish, roasted green beans (like padrone peppers!) and potato slivers to die for. \u00a0All of the dishes had plenty of spice, never too hot, some even had that slight but pleasurable mouth numbing effect due to a special peppercorn that is used in this type of cooking. One secret: I took some leftovers home and had them for lunch two days later, and was blown away by how tasty they were. Like twice as good as before!",

    "text": "When its frosty outside, the best remedy is hot pot, also known as steamboat)! For those who don't know what hot pot is - it's a communal way of cooking and eating your food in a pot of broth (assorted varieties). \u00a0It's a cozy way to eat, so I'm always stoked to have this whenever it gets chilly outside! Sichuan Folk serves other Szechuan dishes, aside from hot pot - but we were there only for HP, at \u00a319.80/head, unlimited food. \u00a0The servers were really friendly from start to finish, though they were keen to try and get us to order more drinks and starters. \u00a0Never did they seem annoyed with us when we were asking for more food items, water glasses, etc. \u00a0Tell 'em what you like, and they'll bring you more!We had 10 people there, so they had 2 HP burners on the long row of tables, and brought out a few trays of assorted meat, veg, tofu and noodle items. \u00a0We had 2 split pots - with half normal broth, and half spicy Szechuan peppercorn broth. \u00a0The food included Beef / Lamb / Pork slices, fish balls, imitation crab meat (Alaskan Pollack), luncheon meat, fish slices, frozen tofu / bean curd, prawns, mussels, Korean potato noodles, mushrooms, napa cabbage and other leafy greens. \u00a0When we got another refill on seafood, they actually had - CRAB legs! Get outta here, I've never seen an all you can eat HP place serve crab legs. \u00a0Well, yum! Compared to another HP place that I went to in London (Beijing Dumpling), there were a few things missing, that I would've liked to have: soft tofu, fresh chicken slices, chicken wings, corn, wider variety of Chinese greens (tong ho, watercress, spinach), dumplings, udon, konnyakku noodle bundles, fried taro, shrimp / beef / squid paste balls, and I'm sure several other things. \u00a0But I think the STANDOUT item at SF was the beef, because it was cut into slightly thicker pieces and marinated, giving it just a bit more flavour, and SO MUCH MORE TENDER! \u00a0It was also nice that there were crab legs too! Definitely made up for it.There is also a good spread of sauces: garlic, spring onion, coriander, soy, vinegar, peanut sauce, chilli sauce and a few other things - but the Chinese Bullhead Barbecue sauce was missing in action, and its normally a MUST for hot pot! \u00a0Not related to the American BBQ sauce - its a Chinese satay (sa-cha) sauce, oily, made from a mishmash of garlic, spices, shallots, and aromatic dried fish and shrimp. \u00a0ITS DELICIOUS. \u00a0Maybe they ran out? \u00a0Anyway, the food still tasted fine. Hotpot Tips and Etiquette: - Bring a hair tie- Its buffet style, so dress accordingly! And a dark colored top in case there is any splashing- Use your strainer to get the food, unless everyone at the table is OK with double dipping their chopsticks into the pot- If you have the spicy Szechuan soup, I recommend to strain out all the peppercorns and peppers out before cooking. \u00a0It'll be spicy enough as is, and its annoying when all those things get stuck in your food. \u00a0You don't want to choke on a Szechuan peppercorn. \u00a0Your face will go numb and tingly. \u00a0Seriously.- Always let your chopsticks boil off in the broth for a few seconds longer when putting food into the pot (even if there are cooking chopsticks) - mixups happen, better to be safe than sorry - Annoyed that the food you put in there is now gone? Instead of cooking just for yourself, let everyone know you're putting in extra shrimp / lamb / etc in, and to help themselves, they'll do the same. \u00a0Sharing is caring. \u00a0- Don't overload the pot by putting EVERYTHING in. \u00a0It'll slow down the cooking time, and the food will get old and gross quickly- Be creative with your bowl of dipping sauce. \u00a0Ditch the plain soy sauce. \u00a0Mix it up with sesame / peanut sauce, garlic, scallions + coriander, and chilli - and sa cha sauce if they have it. For \u00a325, I had a bottle of plum juice, shared a garlic cucumber appie, and had some great hotpot with friendly service. \u00a0=)",

    "text": "It was news to me that there's some really decent Szechuan food in and around Bethnal Green. \u00a0I really like it, but my past experiences in London have put a bit of a dent in my wallet (Bar Shu, Empress of Sichuan...), so hearing about Sichuan Folk really piqued my interest.As Kevin L. says, there is a really positive atmosphere in the place. \u00a0It feels pretty cosy and relaxed and I really prefer that over the upmarketness of the aforementioned places in Soho.The menu would be a little bit daunting for many with plenty of offally dishes, preserved egg, and the slightly ominous \"numbing and hot dry beef\" (which contains Szechuan peppercorns). \u00a0However, a little bravery goes a long way here, and there are plenty of options for those with an aversion to mystery meat. \u00a0We were most fortunate to have Kevin L. ordering for us - my favourite dishes were the hot and sour soup (which is a lot different to the standard cantonese style), the smashed cucumbers (it sounds a bit odd, but the cucumber is nice and crunchy and the sauce is nommy), the fragrant-and-hot pig trotters (I love pig trotters and this dish was perfect. \u00a0Sticky and crunchy on the outside, gooey on the inside - I really recommend it, and they're pretty tame as far as odd parts go), the ma po tofu, and the twice-cooked pork, complete with a set of steamed buns.Plenty of food at a reasonable price - I'm really looking forward to coming back here. \u00a0Highly recommended to the more adventurous diners out there, but I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants something a bit different to your standard HK-style fare.",

    "text": "It is a welcome change from a sea of Indian restaurants on Bricklane. Like most Chinese restaurants abroad, it is not fancy at all. The menu offers a variety of Sichuan dishes at reasonable price. I was craving some seriously Chinese and spicy food one evening, so I went and ordered kidney in spicy sauce. I know most of you probably are grossed out by the sound of it, because a lot of my non-Chinese friends are not fans of organs. However, it does show the authenticity of the menu, doesn't it? I was a bit disappointed by it, because the dish wasn't that spicy or particularly flavorful. I was reminded a bit of the Chinese food I was missing, but was by no means fully satisfied after eating the dish. I also ordered Dan Dan noodle, which was quite delicious.",

    "text": "Quick glance:+ conveniently located near the City for something different+ full of Chinese diners - a good sign?+ courteous, accommodating staff- food was a bit too oily and salty I had dinner with a few friends here on a weeknight. The venue wasn't packed, but floor space appeared limited so booking in advance is advisable. On the evening we visited, the patrons all appeared to be Chinese which could be a positive sign if they had trekked all the way to (nearly) Brick Lane for some Sichuan food. Or maybe it merely reflects the lack of Sichuan (or just decent Chinese food) in the area. One of my friends is expecting a baby and has requested no MSG in our foods, which led to a friendly, lengthy discussion with the waiter over what could be arranged. He was very thorough to explain that pre-marinated meats have been prepared with MSG, but he could request the chef to omit MSG from vegetarian dishes. I thought it was very kind of him to be honest about their preparation. The staff were courteous and accommodating, but were slightly \"ditzy\" at times, for example forgetting the special soups we have ordered so only half the table received the \"house soup\" and the other half were left waiting. The food were decently flavoured but perhaps we had ordered the wrong dishes; I found our dishes to be either too salty or too oily. Nevertheless they made a good treat for a hungry stomach. The restaurant has no dessert offering (as at time of writing) so if you have a sweet tooth I would recommend going down the road to Patisserie Valerie in Spitalfields Market for a slice of cake. I would recommend this restaurant if you are near the City and really fancied some Sichuan flavours but don't want to travel far. There are no doubt better restaurants in this category sprinkled throughout London, but it is good enough to satisfy a sudden craving.",

    "text": "On a business trip here in London and this restaurant was recommended by one of my co-workers. \u00a0My co-worker and I came here for dinner as both of us where craving for some good Chinese food and were getting sick of the hotel fare and the usual sandwiches and.....fish and chips LOLIf you're in the Shoreditch area it's about a 10-15 minute walk from the Liverpool Station. \u00a0It's about two blocks down from Shoreditch High Street. \u00a0The area itself is pretty swanky and there are lot of other restaurants nearby....try those next time when you're in the area.The restaurant specializes on Sichuan dishes. \u00a0So, please don't be expecting Americanized \"Chinese\" dishes like broccoli and beef. \u00a0Time to try to some authentic cuisine, now! \u00a0The menu is pretty cool since it's essentially a book with pictures and descriptions of each dish. \u00a0The wait staff is more than helpful and they will help guide in selecting the right dish and matches your liking. \u00a0A lot of the dishes are spicy as Sichuan is famously known for. Most dishes ranges from \u00a37-\u00a38. Their signature dishes tend to be more expensive around \u00a312.50. \u00a0 The meal for the two of us was about \u00a326. \u00a0The only down side is that when converted to dollars the meal was close to $50. \u00a0But, that's not the restaurant's fault....things here in the UK are double-the price than in the US due to the exchange rate of the pound versus the dollar. As food is concerned, I got the Mabo Tofu and my co-worker got this spicy fish stew. \u00a0Both were dishes were flavorful and good. \u00a0The dishes may seem a little bit oily, but it's not that bad. \u00a0The Mabo Tofu comes in two versions one for vegetarians without meat or the traditional version which comes with minced pork. \u00a0I got the traditional version and the flavor combination of the pork and the texture of the tofu was good balance. \u00a0The spicy fish stew was a pretty big portion - but it came with a lot of vegetables, peppers, and good chunks of cod that were seasoned to perfection.Overall, I'd recommend this place if you're in the area and want something that will spice things up and also bring something different to your culinary palette.",

Although it's slightly off the beaten path from me, as I live in North London, I come here at least once a week for the great, authentic Sichuan food and the good customer service. The host is charming and always gives good tips on what to order from the menu. I have my favourites, particularly the starter sample platter, anything with fish and peppers and the lamb and pork dishes. They also have a sound, inexpensive wine list. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",

Next time, be sure to ask for extra spicy. I had the twice cooked pork which was quite flavorful and had a bit of a kick (although I would have preferred spicier). The steamed buns it came with were a bit tough and the plate was a bit oily. However, I would order this again. The signature dumplings were pretty solid. The sesame vinegar soy sauce was a nice touch but I would have preferred some ginger and Chilis in there too. Be warned that it tastes like the dumplings have a bit of cilantro in them. Some people really can't stand cilantro. I am usually one of those people but the taste was mild and was cut by the sauce. I would order these again and ask for some Chilis to add. A couple behind me ordered the hot pot and they were really enjoying it. The pictures for every item on the menu was helpful - makes trying something new a little bit easier.",

Despite it being in the trendiest neighbourhood (not?), Sichuan Folk feels like a hole in the wall and it is exactly this non-pretentiousness that I appreciate so much about this place.Plus, they do offer quite good and authentic Chinese food. Ideally, you're with someone who is familiar with that cuisine, but even if you're not, simple ask the friendly staff for some advise. (I do recommend to tell them that you're adventurous, because otherwise they will suggest the more tame items on the menu to you, whereas this is really the place where you should do some experimenting.Luckily, I was always with someone who knows their Chinese menu upside down, which on the other hand also leaves me in no memory of what it exactly it was that we ordered/ate ;-) In light of this, I do recommend reading the reviews of Kevin L, Yee Gan O, Rob H and Yinnie C...all of them trusted experts!",

    "text": "Thanks to Katie B and Rob C for introducing me to this restaurant a few weekends ago. As soon as I spotted the non nonsense menu offerings, I knew this had to be the venue for the Yelp Extreme Eating Event 3.0Tonight, 8 interpid Yelpers headed down to challenge our tastebuds with a healthy dose of chilli-rich Sichuan food and also unusual body parts and ingredients. The menu helpfully has pictures of most of the dishes (though disappointingly there wasn't one of the fried loofah and we were too scared to order it at \u00a37.80). The staff speak excellent English and will help you navigate the more challenging parts of the menu if necessaryIn the tradition of YEEEs, we ordered by everyone shouting out dishes which they liked the sound of and once again, we ended up with a great variety of dishes. Yinnie C won the starter round with her cloud ear fungus mushroom dish though the offal slices and thousand year old egg were great tooFor mains, I loved the pork knuckle - some may find it a bit fatty but that's perfect for me, the crispy frog legs (I initially thought it tasted like chicken and then I saw the small bones) and the ma po tofuEverything had distinct flavour. The heat levels were enough to numb the tongue occasionally but never hot enough to wipe out your tastebudsWe left, suitably filled up and challenged though not as much as Titthankar D has been in the past - he showed us a picture of fried guinea pig that he had eaten beforeRoll on YEEE 4.0. Hot pot, anyone?",

    "text": "We found this on Yelp and it's a very decent Chinese restaurant in Spitalfields that favours-as per the name-Sichuan cuisine over the far more staple Cantonese. I was therefore intrigued to try it as Sichuan is far more prevalent over the pond. The scene from \"Beetlejuice\" came to mind as I entered where the lady, having moved to the sticks Upstate, remarks when picking at her Chinese takeaway\"what, they don't do Sichuan here!\" \u00a0I was a little put off by one review describing it as a slightly basic interior, but whilst hardly China Tang it is a pleasant and fairly minimal interior with no harsh lighting. We arrived not long before closing but service was still very friendly and helpful. I confess to having an irrational hatred of menus such as the one here \u00a0which show pictures of the dishes-none in my view look very appealing. Anyway, the menu itself has a \u00a0real emphasis on meat and offal, though still does seafood. I was going to try the frogs' legs and will certainly return to do so. However, for now we played it safe. I was gratified to receive a response from our waiter that I had \"ordered well\" . To start we had two lots of the dumplings-vegetarian and pork. Both were excellent but I particularly liked the pork ones which were rich and spicy (the pork was nice and lean). For mains, we had chicken in peanuts (I know, not exactly adventurous!) and the double cooked pork as well as peashoots and rice. The pork came with four dumplings and we were told to use them by breaking them open and stuffing the pork inside. I thought it all excellent, but I particularly liked the chicken. The pork was good, though it had a little fat which I'm not massively keen on-still very flavourful though. Overall, a great and reasonably priced experience. Somewhere some frogs are walking around with legs that I will shortly devour at Sichuan folk.",

    "text": "Arguably some of the best Chinese food I've had in London thus far. Hat tip to Amy A for recommending it to me. Finding properly spicy food in this country is a bit hit-or-miss to begin with, but to find really mouthwatering Szechuan cuisine (er... Sichuan?) has been a near impossibility until now.From the moment I walked into this modest-looking restaurant, I had a positive vibe. Whether it was the delicious scents wafting about, or the fact that the staff and various other patrons were speaking in Mandarin, I knew from the very start that I'd come to the right place.I'll be honest in saying that my least favourite dishes that we shared family-style (of course) were the ones recommended by the staff. Perhaps they were steering us toward things that Brits like more? But the fried potatoes were basically crispy Chinese french fries and the house dumplings, whilst they looked to be covered in delicious sauce, came out surprisingly flavourless to me.That said, everything else was superb. The smashed cucumbers went down a treat, the 'ants climbing a tree' (ma ee sang su) and mapo tofu both had that rich aromatic Szechuan peppercorn heat to them. And the twice-cooked pork dish served with steam buns is an absolute hunger slayer.Be prepared to order a couple bottles of Tsing Tao to balance out the heat in the dishes, but the mild tingling ma la sensation is a big part of the reason to come. I fully expect to work this into my regular rotation of dining destinations now that I know it's here!",

    "text": "Authenticity - it's a thing that people want. I'm never sure why, though. The main thing would seem to be to the food and atmosphere and all those other things which actually make for a good restaurant not the precision with which the chef can emulate the flavour at the bottom of a noodle bowl bought on the street in Chengdu. There's an indian round the corner from me that prides itself on being throughly authentic, but - frankly - I've never left there without feeling that my longing for a Curry has gone cruelly unsated.So, yeah, authenticity. I'm pretty sure that this is an authentic representation of Sichuan cookery. The rest of the diners all looked like regulars sinking into the comforting relief of being served food that they knew. But that isn't why you should go here \u00a0(now. at once.) \u00a0- it's because authentic Sichuan food is AWESOME and because this is one of the few places I've found in London that will sell it to you for a (very) reasonable price.The best bits are the cold starters - especially the husband and wife offal slices which are a masterful symphony of texture, heat and meaty goodness; and the smacked cucumbers which are as fun to eat as to order. The green bean dish that was recommended as an addition to the main dish is one of the kindest things ever done to a vegetable. The twice cooked pork is great, and numbing and hot kidney slices are lovely. The waiter warned us against eating the dried chillis from the fiery hell broth they came in - advice which we immediately ignored to joyous effect. Perhaps the dishes were a bit shy about the use of Sichuan peppercorns - I didn't quite get that insane numb face thing that I've had elsewhere in the world. And perhaps they have slightly toned down the heat for London tastes? \u00a0It's hard to say, but I didn't quite reach that peak of dizzy chilli euphoria that I was looking for - but still, the food is great, the dining room is nice, the service is exemplary and I loved it teh most.If you're new to Sichuan, go right now, order loads and try everything - you'll likely still walk out having paid less than \u00a320 a head. If you're not new to it, I don't know of a better version in the UK and if you do, TELL ME ABOUT IT BECAUSE I AM HUNGRY FOR PAIN.",

When we left, I saw that the place was just totally packed and no available tables at all, so perhaps if you're going you should get a reservation to be safe.Anyways, the food was not bad. It was not that spicy actually although it did have some authentic qualities to it, it just was not quite there. We got the spicy cold beef was good, but like I said it was good but there wasn't enough flavor. I think the twice cooked pork was better but wish that they would give us more than 4 little buns. The dumplings were not bad, but no spicy sauce at all. They were out of the herbal tea...and I was like \"noooo\" That is a must when eating spicy!

Attentive staff. \u00a0The food? \u00a0Not so great.To be clear, guests have the option of ordering from the menu or go with the hot pot format. \u00a0This diner went with the menu option on a Sunday night.Summary:What is served here is, in my opinion, severely democratized versions of Sichuan cuisine (read: NOT SPICY). \u00a0There's also an absence of other critical ingredients from which Sichuan cuisine derives its fabulous aroma like toasted bits of garlic, whole peppercorns and generous helpings of red pepper flakes. \u00a0Taken together, I can't say I'm a fan.Details:The all-season beans were ordered pan fried but was served much too limpy and wet. \u00a0Strike one.The stewed spicy pork belly was particular disappointing, not least because it was slightly microwaved. \u00a0Nuked meats have a very telling flavor - can't really hide that. \u00a0Why the dish came with four peking-style sweet buns absolutely confused me. \u00a0Strike two.Bad service would have made the third strike. \u00a0This was their saving grace.",

    "text": "Sometimes you need a good cry, watching sad films, reading a sad book. At Yelp, there's a bunch of us extreme eaters that eat chilli to make us cry. Yes. we are hardcore. At the same time, we also make conventional eaters and vegetarians cry because extreme eating doesn't just involve killing your tastebuds with ma-la chilli, but also weird ingredients, like jellyfish, cloud ear fungus, pig trotters and frog legs. Sorry peeps. That's just how we roll. 8 people turned up, I like to say we ordered in a civilised way, but we didn't. Our tactic: scream out whatever sounds weird on the menu, and keep going. We ordered a number of starters that included husband and wife offal slices, cloud ear fungus (I LOVE THIS SO MUCH.), jellyfish, and some other random items that looked and tasted amazing. We were doing so well with the spicy and daring ordering until Tirththanker let the game down with his chicken and sweetcorn soup. (LOL Just kidding, we don't judge Tirth!!)Mains, twice cooked pork, pork knuckle, beef in 75% chilli oil, frog legs, and SO much more. I left defeated and that's saying something (I out ate all the guys at congee chronicles UYE.) This time though, Rob won the last man eating challenge. One of my favourite dishes is the frog legs, the sichuan chilli pepper had a lemony numbing zing to it which is just something that is unlike anything in western cooking. I definitely recommend that dish if you're feeling adventurous.Also, Sichuan Folk's offerings are similar quality to bar shu, for less money, that's always a win. The only difference, the chilli here is meant to kick you slightly and keep you wanting more. The chilli at bar shu just wants to kick you, like a hooligan, after a football match, and also sucker punching you in the mouth, in terms of chilli hotness. (I'll admit though, maybe it's like domestic violence thing, but I will still go back to bar shu) \u00a0And the staff are way friendlier here. Ma La Hotpot next time guys?",

    "text": "Brick Lane. Great place for a Chinese.Sichuan Folk sits on Hanbury Street amongst hundreds of great food places and thousands of not so good Indian restaurants.It's an unassuming place. Actually the room is really quite cold and functional. bare walls, blocks of tables. Not much to excite curiosity or make you want to hang around too long. Unpromising.But the menu is full of authentic Sichuan fare which really excites, making up for the dull room. Cloud Ear Fungus, tripe, pigs trotters, cuttlefish, frogs legs. The list of stuff which will either have you screwing your face up or feeling ever so adventurous goes on and on. It's very similar to Ba Shan in Soho, a place that has built a great reputation for similar fare and blistering spiciness (I've reviewed it on here somewhere).We ordered smacked cucumber, salt and chilli squid (does anybody not order the salt and chilli squid? If you exist let me tell you you're not quite right), twice cooked pork, duck cooked with beer, a tofu hot pot, some dumplings and a chicken dish that escapes me although it wasn't the 'numbing hot chicken wings' (actual name) which I've had at Ba Shan and can confirm the name is most apt.Everything that came was delicious. They pride themselves on their hot pots and the tofu one and the duck one were really interesting and intense. A real mixture of flavours and texture. Our server only too happy to explain stuff to us like how to eat the twice cooked pork which came with light fluffy pancake type buns which you use to build your delicious chinese sarnie.This food is certainly challenging in parts (deep fried pig's intestines anyone?) but with 20 pages of menu to get through even the most squeamish are certain to find something exciting and memorable that they can stomach. \u00a0If you're sick of the Indian restaurants hawking their muck and want a haven from the bearded groovy wordbenders that populate this area, dive in here where you'll find it full of people - mostly chinese when we walked in - who are just here for the food. No gimmicks, no razzle dazzle, just lots of great unexpected, ferocious cooking. So authentic are the tastes I even ventured a small 'ni hao' as I left. Yes, yes it means 'hello' but I hope it showed I felt a little bit more Chinese than I did when I walked in. I reckon this lot could make my old Adidas shell toes taste good given a few spices and a bit of time. I may even try the tripe when I go back.",

Everything at every table looked delicious, and the portions were generous but not over the top.We had the egg and seaweed soup -- good but wouldn't order again as the seaweed was very large and difficult to eat and a bit overpowering.The twice-cooked pork was great. A bit on the salty side and not as spicy as I anticipated, but full of flavor.We also ordered their version of kung-pow chicken, which was different than what I'm accustomed to and preferable. Good chunks of chicken, roasted peanuts and a tangy sauce.Be warned that like a lot of places here any rice will cost you extra, you won't just get white rice with your meal.Would definitely return here and try more if only I lived in London!",

Surrounded by ridiculous hipster vintage clothing shops bordering Shoreditch / Liverpool Street it's certainly less in your face unlike other places nearby which adds to its charm.If you are going in without a Chinese speaker that's fine because the menu is pretty clear. My standard go to items are the Gong Bao chicken and the fried beans without pork. Those beans are heavenly - one of my former colleagues introduced me to it and I sometimes try to recreate them when home but I just can't! There must be some chef secret. It's basically beans and garlic :) simple but effective. Other items worth recommending is the tender sichuanese fish not to be confused with a fried fish they offer which is a little heavy on the oil (minus one star) Ultimately for good authentic Chinese food at reasonable prices - worth checking out.",

    "text": "I wanted to do a Chinese New Year dinner gathering with friends, and this place came up as one of the few restaurants in London where you can do hot pot. Who knew there were such limited options? When I tried booking online, I could only do it for a maximum party size of 6, but I followed up with the restaurant to extend the reservation for 10 people. They also have this strange policy where online bookings are cash only, whereas if you book by other method (presumably by phone), you can pay by card. I'd recommend the latter for convenience of payment, but I suppose it is rather convenient to be able to book online as well. We were given a round table in the back of the restaurant, perfect for a social gathering of friends, and two large hotpots that had two flavours in each. They were even able to accommodate one of my friend's dietary restrictions by making one of them vegetarian broth.The deal is \u00a321.80 for all you can eat, which started off with two heaping trays with all the classics you can think of, including some impressive and interesting additions such as fresh crab, mussels, and spam. You can then ask for top ups of whatever you want, and we got at least 2 more platters of lamb and spam. The only complaint we had is that the imitation crab was not taken out of the plastic wrapping, and it was a pain to do that by hand. There is an array of sauce ingredients in one corner of the restaurant, and you can help yourself to additional spoons, bowls, napkins, etc. Service is incredibly quick and when we ordered beers or top ups, we received them almost instantly. The staff were also extremely attentive in filling up our hot pot with additional hot water. I could not have asked for better service, which is almost surprising to find in a Chinese restaurant!I'd definitely come again. We all ate to our heart's delight, and the food and service were both top notch.",

    "text": "We've been here for the all-you-can-eat hot pot as well as ordered a la carte off the menu. Coming from New York, we've had some pretty good Sichuan meals as well as some good AYCE hot pot. Thus, the cold London winter elicited a craving for some hot pot. A quick search on Yelp showed that for central London there were only a few options. We had been referred to Sichuan Folk for their a la carte dishes but when we saw AYCE hot pot on the menu, we were sold.For \u00a319.80 per person, they'll keep serving you until you're ready to burst! Now, in NY you can get AYCE hot pot with AYCD Budweiser/soda for $27. So, it isn't as cheap as NY and we didn't get the drinks but, from my research, it does seem to be one of the cheaper AYCE hot pot places in London (most start at \u00a320-\u00a325). The one thing that I didn't love was the fact that they didn't have sa cha sauce (Asian BBQ sauce). How could that be?! That's a staple for any hot pot meal and something I definitely always pile on! Adam has suggested I bring my own. Next winter I'll definitely have to see if they've added it to their sauces. Fingers crossed!In terms of the soup base, we went with a \"ying yang\" pot with the traditional hot and spicy on one side and the more mellow chicken broth based on the other. The AYCE hot pot did come on a huge plate with a good variety of offerings - sliced beef, pork, chicken, fish balls, variety of greens, imitation crab meat, noodles, various mushrooms, fish slices and shrimp. I will say that these were some of the best AYCE shrimp either of us had ever had. We don't expect high quality shrimp when we go to AYCE but these were really good! The dish had a couple of things that we just weren't feeling - lunch meat, mussels (obviously frozen) and wish we had asked about what came on the plate since at other places you can opt out of options. We had actually also ordered some appetizers, we were starving when we got there, so were down for the count after one plate. Sad, but we definitely will know better the next time. The other couple of times we've come to have their a la carte Sichuan dishes. For London, it's quite good. Sometimes I find food in London bland so I was worried that the spices would be muted but they definitely don't hold back! We started with a recommendation from our server, the Sichuan-folk tripe salad (\u00a39.80). If you love sichuan peppercorns with that numbing sensation this is the dish for you. Offal isn't for everyone but the tripe was quite nice and was mixed with some crunchy strips of celery to give some crunch to the dish. There was some fresh chopped chiles as well as some cilantro sprinkled through. Definitely something different from the norm and quite a bright and refreshing dish. We ordered Sichuan-folk cumin lamb (\u00a310.80) which came with 4 steamed buns (the type that come with Peking duck). This was a cumin bomb! The little lamb nuggets were heavily covered in cumin and deep fried. Placing some of the lamb in the bun helped to cut some of the savoriness of the dish. I found this dish slightly too salty and after all the buns were finished off we requested some rice because I couldn't eat it on it's own.Like we do at every Sichuan restaurant, we ordered the Ma po tofu with pork mince (\u00a38.50) and found it quite good! The nice thing about Sichuan Folk's version is that it isn't overly oily while still having a nice kick. The tofu is firmer than some other versions I've had but this was a really great version. We get it every time we go here.Another dish we usually order at Sichuan restaurants was the dry-fried green beans with pork mince (\u00a38.50) - such a great dish. Fried green beans with minced pork and pickled mustard greens, I love this dish! Also, many places don't actually get rid of the ends of the green beans - such a small thing, I know - but was a nice touch!There have been occasions when I've had the traditional hot and sour soup (\u00a34.80) which was quite a good rendition. Good balance of white pepper with vinegar and a nice smattering of tofu, black fungus mushroom, bamboo shoots. I would order this again but the price only comes with one small bowl so I did find this a bit expensive!Adam and I love dumplings so we have ordered the signature dumplings (\u00a34.80) which I would definitely recommend ordering! Made in-house, the skins were delicate and the slightly spicy and vinegary soy sauce it was bathed in was a perfect complement. We've been here 3-4 times in the past 6 months and it is our current go-to when we want Sichuan! The flavors seem much more clean than other Sichuan restaurants. Additionally, it is much less oily than other places. I did find the portion size to price ratio a bit skewed and would have preferred bigger portions based on the prices; however, at the same time the food is SO good! We will be back again and again! If you're looking for quality Sichuan, you should definitely check out Sichuan Folk!",

    "text": "Maybe closer to 3.5 stars - I'd have to go back and give it another whirl.I had the dumplings to start but they were a bit mushy and the flavour was good but maybe just not as strong as I would like. Then I had the spicy dry chicken (with bones) which was also pretty good but they over-fried the chicken a bit and it was just a real pita to eat given all the bones. Some fault goes to me though because I was warned...These places are making me really look forward to going back to NYC and getting my Chinese food there - its just on another level. Overall the staff was on it and very nice and I did like what I ate but I may not go back...",

Here is what we ordered:Dumpings - pretty good, could be served at a higher temperature.Smacked cucumber - delicious peanut sauceTwice cooked pork - came with 4 baos (steamed buns), tasty but soo OILYSpare ribs - fried in a batter and tasty - but make sure you have water or beer to wash it down!Seabass - fun to see the whole fried, fish looking like it's trying to jump out of the dish. It was a sweet chili flavor. It was crunchy and tasted good, but there isn't much meat to the fish. Overall \u00a0- the dinner was pretty salty and oily. I felt inspired to do a cleanse the next day.",
