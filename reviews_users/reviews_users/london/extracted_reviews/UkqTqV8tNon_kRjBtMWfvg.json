Famous for it journalistic clientele such as Jeffrey Bernard from the Spectator and a really cranky landlord, a takeover a few years ago hasn't changed it as much as I feared it would. Lovely lovely beers including real ales, friendly and knowlegable staff - only drawback is it's too popular and it's practically impossible to find a seat, so be prepared to stand! If you can get a seat, the food is quite good pub grub, better than most in the area, and the real ales washes it all down nicely. Nice place to bring a few mates for a laugh and a pint.",

    "text": "It's not hard to miss the Coach & Horses, down at the bottom of Greek Street. Most of the Soho buzz is a street or two away. It is, however, one of the proper and unpretentious pubs in Soho. The pub isn't very big inside, although (or maybe as a result) it retains a great deal of its Victorian charm. There are panels and mirrors, columns in what seem to be odd places, booths and stools, and a tiny entrance to the toilets. The meals available - sandwiches, hot pots, and some more substantial fare - can be found on various sheets of paper stuck to the walls. The crowd can be a real mix, and often includes many of Soho's journalists and writers. The Coach & Horses' association with scribblers and playwrights, as well as some of its colourful proprietors, have made it somewhat famous (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th\u2026) . It's quirky character seeps out in the little cracks and corners: the food board that is headed, \"Eat, damn you!\" and advertises \"pyes\", or the playful Israeli bartender. However, for those of us who simply want a relaxed surrounding, no modern chain-pub accoutrements, lots of ales and bottles on offer, and an eclectic crowd, this pub will do just fine. A nice addition is the recently-opened private function room upstairs. You need to be admitted behind the bar to get to it, but once up the narrow twisting stairs you'll find an open, comfortably appointed, dimly lit lounge that's great for private hire for a couple of dozen people. There's a small private bar to serve the room, plus a separate toilet, and it gets the same kitchen service as downstairs. I was in this room last night for a London Bloggers Meetup , and it served us really well. I'm told that Qype and other groups are planning to use the room for similar events. It's a nice addition to the venue.",

Now that I'm an old man (and understand around 25% of the content) I'm still thrilled to regularly visit the bar commemorated in Michael Heath's The Regulars. The reason I went with this place as the first venue for London's nascent Social Media Caf\u00e9 was, well, because Alastair was up for doing something different and willing to take a chance on us but it was also because I could see the continuity of the history of the pub as a gathering place for writers pushing at the boundaries of what is doable and acceptable. It's just a lovely London pub - it doesn't feel like it's trying to be anything, it just is what it is and certainly downstairs it looks as though its been that way for quite some time (as do the regulars drinking down the deep end). However, if you're brave enough to ask permission to cross the threshold of the bar and creep upstairs, the dining room's a real treat, very comfy and with cool views along Greek Street and Romilly Street and the menu is one of those that has me sitting going, oh, I don't know, umm yes, I want it all please.",

The server said yes and then complained that the barkeep sent me up to eat instead of accomodating me down there. I ordered the homemade bean burger. It was awful, came with no sides except 2 awful homemade onion rings. The bean burger was mushy and tasteless, except for the taste of old grease, the same old grease that soaked the two onion rings. I was charged a service charge, so a terrible bean burger and two onion rings cost me almost 14 GBP, about $21 US. Awful food for an awful price! Plus the server got in trouble from the boss for eating and then complained about it the whole time after he was gone. What a mess.",

    "text": "Hello everyone, the Qype Party last night was awesome. The venue was great! Great choice! Thanks to the organizers, you did a great job!You are all very nice. I am so happy that I came. I met so many people last night, I made friends and planned to meet them so times next week. I spent most of my time outside in the smoking area. It all started when I went there to smoke. I felt very lonely because I was on my own and then a few people came and some others after We ended up staying there the whole night because the weather was great Thank you so much for the free drinks and free food. It was really appreciated. I took a few pictures last night. I will try to upload them this week-end. Well done guys! I hope to see you soon. Take care, Emilie PS: If you read this review and you were at the party last night and recognise me, please drop me an e-mail, I will be so happy to chat with you again. It is just that yesterday I was a bit drunk and did not get everyone's name or usernames. Sorry ;-) And good luck to those who are working today I don't think I am going to be very efficient today",

And last night was qype night. The room is a little on the small side, but that's no bad thing when you want to meet up with new folk. The chef had taken a rather vaudeville approach to platter production; trays of spanish omlette, prawn cocktail, cottage pies in beakers and egg mayo sandwiches as the pi\u00e9ce de la resistance. It would've been annoying for the smokers to troop downstairs every time they fancied a crafty tab, thankfully there's a private alley-balcony on which to smirt. I liked it, even the unisex loo.",

    "text": "UPDATE - The upstairs bar was extortionate tonight. \u00a311.50 for two glasses of wine (one of which they served me in a lager glass)... even the barmaid was shocked by how much it was. Went downstairs at the end of the evening, two glasses of wine was \u00a36.80 - when I asked why it was so expensive upstairs, they said that because to hire the room it was free, there was a service charge on the drinks. Now, usually a service charge is 12%, for some reason, they thought we wouldn't notice they were charging a 50% service charge. And you're not allowed to buy drinks downstairs and take them upstairs for 'health and safety reasons'... because we can't carry drinks upstairs apparently. What they mean is they hope we don't notice that we're being ripped off. I had a great night at the last bloggers meet up, but I don't like being fleeced. Now this pub have got a bit of a folllowing, they for some reason think it's OK to screw over their punters. I've taken two stars off them. I'll drink downstairs, but don't expect me to be happy about it anymore. - UPDATE * Yep. Big thumbs up to the Coach and Horses, who have some of the nicest bar staff ever. The food the dished up was fab, and they were extra helpful at the Qype party by making sure they came straight to my two veggie friends as soon as new veg kebabs were ready. This was very sweet. The pub is great. It's old school and quite off the beaten track for a Soho pub. No bad thing. I liked being led through the actual bar to get upstairs, and the little smoking part of the pub was a lot of fun and seemed to be having a party all on its own. Nothing to complain about with this pub. I'll be coming back soon - if only to abuse their free wi-fi while I drink beer and pretend to be working.",

I ordered the beetroot ravioli per the yelp recommendations; however, I did not realize the beets were served raw. It was hard to cut through the beets and at some point I gave up and left the dish behind. The beets should have been cooked at least slightly, in my opinion. Second, I ordered the tofush fingers...bland...I dumped a truckload of salt on them and they still weren't good. As you can infer, I would not return, nor recommend this place to a friend.",

    "text": "As a vegetarian, I love the idea of getting traditional English pub food vegetarian-style. Plus, the restaurant was just down the street from our hotel, so we had to go! We were confused upon arrival about where to eat. The downstairs bar is a little more crowded and rough-edged than we were looking for. When we told the bartender we planned to eat, he directed us to the upstairs dining area, which was more to our liking. The room wasn't large but it was calm and quiet (there was only one other group eating there) and charming in a typically precious English way (the pink wallpaper is a little much). We met a foodie friend for dinner, and I instantly became nervous that he would hate me forever for dragging him to such a funky place. Surprisingly, he seemed to enjoy his chef's special (a savory pie), and he cleaned his plate. My wife tried the black bean burger with a stack of onion rings on top and barely ate half of it. She also tried the french onion soup and stopped after one bite (I finished it off and thought it was fine for what it was). At the waiter's recommendation, I got the tofuish and chips. I loved the concept of a vegetarian fish and chips, but the taste was a little bland. I'm glad we tried the restaurant, and I really enjoy vegetarian adventures like this regardless of how good the food is. But given the high level of vegetarian restaurant competition in London, I would prioritize other options over visiting this place again.",

    "text": "Non vegan friends ordered bubble and squeak with poached egg and the cauliflower wrapped scotch egg, both were apparently great. One friend enjoyed the curry (REALLY LOVED IT), another didn't get the point of the tofish and chips but said it was an experience and the chips were excellent. Another friend had the bolognese which was delicious.As a vegan I ran into a few problems with the waitress. I initially ordered the shepherds pie, was given the butternut squash pie which wasn't what I ordered and also wasn't vegan. Politely pointed this out and she told me I did order it and it was vegan. Had to show her where it said Red Leicester cheese on the menu. She came back from the kitchen saying it was a new menu and they didn't have shepherds pie. Shame but no matter except it was the only item on the menu with a V so I asked which other items were vegan. Her response was \"all of them - everything is vegan, see - scotch egg....\" At that point I had to stop her to say egg isn't actually vegan. I asked if I could talk to the chef just to make sure I ordered vegan food, she insisted he was too busy (there was our table of 4 and another of 5) and I wouldn't have asked if it wasn't clear she didn't know the difference between vegan and vegetarian food. I stood there while she kinda bad mouthed me through the hatch to the chef who then (understandably because she made out I was being really difficult) declined. He apparently said they could do the bolognese without cheese on top, making it vegan. I wasn't given any other option but was more than happy with that.Just disappointed because I really wasn't making a fuss - if was just very clear that the waitress didn't know what vegan food was (kept offering me cheese and eggs) so I only wanted to order directly from the chef to make sure I got vegan food - specifically chose this pub because they cater to veggies and vegans and I hate having to be extra careful in \"normal\" restaurants.Management/kitchen should make sure waiting staff are trained in the difference between the two dietary requirements and are also not rude about it when you question them!",

    "text": "Im thinking - vegetarian vegan pub right in the heart of the touristy part of Soho.Im thinking - this has to be a gimmick.Im thinking - why am I eating here when there is world changing Chinese food just a few doors away?Well in fact Coach and Horses is the real deal and is an absolutely superior pub.Terrific line of beers on draught.Respectable cider choices.Gins a little weak - but the beers make up for that.Great pub ambience. (Old genteel/decrepit wooden house with a ton of character. - Entrance to the dining room via the dish-washery.)The vegetarian menu is small non-orgasmic but quite reliable.Sunday Roast is a selection of various stuffed vegetables.(Ok - cooks - how many vegetables usually get stuffed? Well the usual candidates all appear here.)The regular menu is a couple of salads, a couple of pub-food-converted-to-vegetarian clones (veggie hamburger/veggie fish and chips etc.) There are some pasta options.You are not looking at a world of choices but what they make is good honest food. The veggie burger is mammoth, filling and uses the standard cheats that all sorts of people use to make a pub sandwich of average ingredients turn into a legitimately decent eat.(Add six hundred garnishes, condiments and vegetables to hide the plain-jane burger or sandwich filling in a world of flavor.)Frankly, the trick works - and the burger is pretty good.An appetizer of ravioli in two kinds of pasta was entertaining enough.Home-made catsup for the fries is good, honest, home-made, and Heinz has no reason to worry that it will be put out of business by micro-catsup-making.The stuff in the bottle is frankly better, but this is an ok change of pace.We did not try their desserts - but they looked decent --- and suitably decadent.(How many vegetarian places try to force something inedible and wholesome flavored exclusively with honey or agave . . . that makes you wish you had eaten more cabbage instead?)The Coach and Horses in contrast offer real desserts.The staff is nice and helpful.Frankly, I like this place better as a drinking place than an eating place - but the eating is entirely decent.And as a place to drink this is way way better than getting a glass of wine at Planet Organic.",

    "text": "I had heard mixed reviews about this place, but mostly the only words reaching my ears were \"VEGAN FISH & CHIPS\" and \"PUB\". So naturally I was sold. A classic British Pub super centrally located, Coach & Horses also offers a surprising vegan menu. The day I was there, they had the classic vegan fish & chips (THANK GAWD), and they also offered a few specials like a raw beetroot ravioli stuffed with cashew cheese and served with an arugula side salad (Delicious, and that comes from someone who doesn't dig beets) (get it?), and a raw green curry. My friend ordered the green curry, not noticing it was labeled raw. We were confused at first as to why it was cold before she recalled reading the word 'Raw'. It was a bit surprising, though very well executed--a parsnip salad instead of rice, and the flavor was really very good. As she said, maybe better as an appetizer, but overall great presentation. My Fish & Chips were very fun. The 'fish' was an ale-battered deep fried tofu wedge coated in nori (seaweed, for that salty ocean flavor), the chips were run of the mill chips, and the tarter sauce was avocado-based. I was hoping for mushy peas because I hadn't had the opportunity to try them yet, but I was thankful for just getting a little bit of veg on my plate. I'd definitely recommend stopping by if you're in London; ale and traditional British Pub food with a vegan twist is actually very hard to come by, and I'm stoked they're here.",

    "text": "I'll give it props for catering to vegans and making traditional meat dishes (fish and chips) vegan-style. Kinda cool. Sadly, the dishes on the website were not all available when we got to the restaurant so some people in our party had arrived craving particular dishes and then were sadly disappointed when those options weren't on the menu any longer. I had a tandoori tofu that was okay. It is hard to flavor tofu well and this was well spiced and flavored but just too much -- imagine a tandoori flavor on a large block of tofu from the market. I appreciated the attempt, but it wasn't amazing. The place smelled of truffle oil, which some people love, but I find it too earthy and not the smell I want to have around me while I eat!Server was very nice, but the dishes all came out haphazardly and my husband's dinner actually wouldn't have arrived at all had we not asked about it (oopsie)!Tea was done well (at least by my American standards).Extra quaint points given for the mouse running around during dinner. I kid you not. He was so brave he got about 2 feet from my dining companions outstretched hand. I name him \"St. John Who Lives in the Walls.\" I think St. John made out better than we did with his dinner. All those chips on the floor make for a happy mouse.The downstairs pub seemed a lot more fun than the upstairs dining area. Came down to someone playing the piano with everyone singing along to classic songs. Very fun, wish we could have stayed for that.",

    "text": "I should say that I'm not sure exactly where we were... we planned on being in the Picadilly Circus-Trafalgar Square area, namely because that's just what you do when you're a first time tourist in London. But, it was very cold and very late, we had landed just hours before and were wandering the crowded Friday night streets riding the adrenaline high and not much else. I knew we'd have to eat at some point so I pulled out my trusty Happy Cow app hoping that we were in proximity to one of the places I had scoped out in advance. To my delight, Coach & Horses was a five-minute walk from where we had wandered to! Tofush and Chips seemed so very appropriate for our first dinner in London, so off we went!The dining room sits two flights of stairs above a crowded pub that overflowed into the street, pints seeping down the edges with various shades of dark beer. The actual interior of the place reminds me of a vintage dollhouse but with all the furnishings removed, stripped down but leaving the essentials. Upstairs, the dining room was no different, except that if this was truly a dollhouse it was definitely the little girl's room. Tea-rose pink walls in various states of disrepair contained small dining tables and showcased mismatched tea sets. It was quaint, but not on purpose, it really was just \"there\".Our actual meal was, of couse, the Tofush and Chips, along with a mushroom pie served with more chips and a sizeable helping of peas. The Tofush was essentially half a block of tofu wrapped in seaweed with a traditional batter. The pie was exactly that- a savory pie in flaky crust, swimming in a pool of dark, smooth gravy. It's extremely hard to get traditional offerings in England, so we were tickled pink that we could enjoy \"fish and chips\" and \"steak and ale pie\" in a vegan sense. The pie was delightful and everything I'd want out of a traditional savory pie, but the tofu fish did leave something to be desired. However, I would still go back and still order it, namely because it's the only establishment in the area bothering to make an effort. The batter was good, and what vegan doesn't love tofu anyways? Sitting in that dim and pink room, tiny window gazing onto the dark street and working my way through a pint, I was as happy as any vegan who just landed in London could be. And that was pretty damn happy.",

When I discovered there was a vegetarian pub in London, I had to experience it for myself.I get in, and I'm a little confused. Everyone is drinking and singing, I don't see anyone eating. After poking around for a bit, I almost leave, until I ask a man behind the bar where to order food. He smiles, lifts the bar for me, and points me up some stairs.It's not at all what I imagined, but it's cute! On the second level of the pub, there's a very kitschy, brightly lit cafe, complete with a cat curled up on a chair.I ordered a beer and a tofush and chips. It was glorious. It was everything I wanted and more. They wrap tofu in seaweed, coat it in beer batter, turning the humble tofu into a decadent British specialty. The chips and peas were a lovely accompaniment. I believe their tartar sauce is homemade, and it was excellent.This is definitely worth a visit if you want to experience vegan pub food in London!",

    "text": "Yes! A fully plant-based pub in London! I frankly wanted \"Fish\" & Chips because I kept on seeing it whilst going about my tourist rounds. Okay, I knew the chances of me eating it were low (we also don't eat onion or garlic nor anything else in the family in addition to being vegetarian) but there was still 5% of hope still clinging on... We walked in at around lunchtime on a Sunday and - there is no way around it - it gave me a slightly \"lazy Sunday\" impression. We were greeted briefly and it was quiet. There was a table of two eating their Tofu & Chips and another man drinking his beer. We hovered for a bit and then realized it was largely self-everything and the bartenders tend the bar and don't leave it. After we sat ourselves after verbally confirming it, we decided it would be faster to just ask what we could have on the menu, I asked the vegan lady bartender. She went to the back and then came out with the verdict 5 minutes later: we could have the Portobello Mushroom Burger (no coleslaw, no fried onions) and the Bangers & Mash (no onion gravy). I was slightly disappointed but happy we weren't stuck with something like salad. Plus, bangers are pretty British! The food came out and though gravy-less, it wasn't bad. The mash was creamy and good; the minced parsley that topped it gave it that freshness. The bangers were deep fried (hot) and house made from a mashed mix that included carrots and radish and molded into perfect \"sausage\" shapes. I quite enjoyed them. I'm sure having gravy could have elevated the dish but it was still good as is. Food (at least the one item we ordered since it was our last free day in London and we had other places we wanted to hit without overeating) was good; I'm (pretty) sure everything else they offer is as well.Service was a bit confusing at first but they were pretty friendly and very helpful once we began to understand the system. I obviously don't frequent bars/clubs often so please excuse the American tourist. :) They do have two separate toilets in the back, though the doors don't close and the \"waiting area\" is a bit on the cramped side.I totally support and cheer on this location!! We always need more veggie options - especially with local cuisines. I'm assuming the place is more lively later on the day, according to the other reviews, but they did have a steady stream of visitors.",

Completely unadorned, the Coach and Horses is essentially a pub that has not left the 1970's, with Double Diamond and Ind Coope logos behind the bar, spectacularly ripped bar stools, linoleum and a gents toilet not far removed from the one in \"Trainspotting\".It's clearly intentional, unfussy, comfortable in its own skin and completely disinterested in your opinion - and all the more to be cherished for that reason. Everywhere else, pubs try so hard to generate \"character\" and \"credibility\", but you've either got it, or you don't. The Coach and Horses does.",

On food alone if give them 4 stars but the customer service just knocks it down one. The food came with home made tarter sauce, chips, fried tofu, lemon and peas. It was great, it had the taste and texture or fish.As I waited I saw several people come in and ask for the secret tea room. Turns out they have another room where you can go and get tea. You can go during the week after 5 but on weekends you need an appointment.If you like Harry Potter and are planning on watching the play then know it's right behind the theater.

We had the tofush and chips and the five-bean burger along with a side of onion rings. The tofush and chips was excellent--crispy, sea-weedy (but not too overpowering). And the mint peas were a revelation. The five-bean burger was good too--hearty, flavorful, and not doused in liters of ketchup. The onions rings were non-soggy and just as they should be.What could definitely be better is the service/ambience. We arrived here, very hungry, at 11:00 as Yelp mentioned that the place opens at 11:00. Open it was, but only the bar. The kitchen opens at 12:00. This is forgiven given the fact that Yelp does not, currently, support different types of opening hours for the same establishment. Anyhoo, we got our drinks and waited till 12:00. At 12:00, I expected the bartender to take our order, but she kept on carrying on with her business. I had to make my way to the counter and ask her if it was ok for me to place the order. Overall, a nice place with lovely food but the service tainted the experience a bit. My advice, go here in the evenings as the place is much livelier then.",

    "text": "Thanks to Normans Coach & Horses I was able to eat fish & chips at my visit to London. Also as a vegan!I really love the concept of vegan pub-food! The staff was very nice and the atmosphere was very cozy. I visited the pub at daytime. I don't know how crowded it is at nights, but it was enough free tables, when I was there. On my next visit to London I will definetely come back to have fish & chips at Normans Coach & Horses.",

    "text": "As a vegan, I had really high hopes for this place, and they haven't let me down. I also happen to like a good, old-fashioned pub, so Coach & Horses ticks major boxes for me, as a fully vegan and vegetarian pub.Their drink selection is great, with a decent variety given the space they have to work with. Having visited a few times now, Frontier on tap and Old Rosie's cider are big winners.I love the Tofush and Chips, and the panna cotta for dessert. As an Aussie, I take chips very seriously, and theirs are lovely, fat steak fries with the right amount of crispness. Yum. The staff can be a little hit and miss, but if you're lucky, you might meet the lovely and personable Kara, who is happy to make some recommendations as to the food and drink. Prices are a little higher than some of the other pubs in the neighbourhood, but there's plenty of history (which is displayed amply on their walls) and a cosy, relaxed vibe.",
