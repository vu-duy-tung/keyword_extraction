It's not somewhere you go randomly, we had to book in advance and you can only stay for 45 minutes which makes it seem like such a money maker but i still had fun. You get given cool capes and gloves when you arrive and the \u00a315 cover charge includes one free drink out of a glass that is made of ice, its a square though so surprisingly hard to drink out of. Also the drinks are really small and obviously made with absolute vodka but tasty nonetheless. One problem is the lack of seating, but I suppose everyone would be freezing to blocks of ice if they were everywhere. And they'd melt too fast. Its really dark inside and the music is very atmospheric, its such a novel place to visit. The kind of place I'd go once though, been there done that. Had a laugh.",

There are two halves to it, the top bar and the icebar: the top half of the bar is pretty cool, great tunes, really good nibbles and some great and unusual drinks (some v. expensive whiskeys!) but the icebar is what you go there for. ITs all made of ice, and you hang out basically ina big fridge for half an hour, drinking out of ice cups, sitting on beautiful carved ice chairs, and ordering from an ice bar, its nuts.",

Basically, it a tiny room made of ice with a bar counter made of ice serving drinks out of 'ice glasses' at a rip-off price. I was in there less than 10mins and I was beginning to get bored. I left earlier that the time slot allocated for me. In conclusion, it's an overrated place that I will not be returning for sure.",

I thought that 45 minutes would not be long enough, but the trouble is, once you have gone in ,done the whole -ooohhh - stuff,and picked out your 'free' drink you're just left standing around going - is this it? Can i go now? I think it is over priced. I reckon it is a bit of a con, because you dont get much to drink - your free drink is tiny. After ten mins you end up buying another one because there is not much else to do. All in all, yes give it a go once. You may or may not enjoy, but you probabaly wont want to come back.",

If you can picture everything made from ice, even the glasses you drink from then you're somewhere there. It is unbelievable, who ever thought of the concept is a genious, a rather loaded genious with a large water bill mind.

Off my checklist of things to do in London !!!Cocktails are quite prICEy, though quite original in names and composition.You have to queue for a bit to get in, as they can only allow so many people in there, as it's quite small, and for 30 minutes only.It was very nICE in the end, and since it's not humid nor windy, the cold is not bothering at all...I would think twICE about going there again, when new friends or family are in town, so see you there !!!!",

Drinks were creative mixes that were hit or miss (some tasted a little weird, but a few were very good! Like the voyager, order it when you're there trust me ;)Definitely worth going to if your around Piccadilly. It's a fun experience, and better than the Ice Bar I went to in Las Vegas. Not too expensive as far as ice bars go. The ground floor is well put together, nice decor, comfy seats, though the bar there is more pricey than the Ice bar itself. We scheduled to go to the icebar at 715 on a wednesday, arrived 10 mins before, and had a great time, no problem with the queue.Only complaint I had was that the coat they gave me smelled a little funky, they could wash that.. because of that, they get 4 stars, not 5",

    "text": "Fun!Came here with a few friends while on holiday in London. We'd heard about it from a friend who had been to London before and decided to give it a go.Once you get there, you pay a cashier an entrance fee (which includes one drink) and they fit you with a blue cloak with a fuzzy fur lined hood to keep you warm inside the bar which is completely made of ice.Apparently they change the interior a few times a year so you won't experience the same exact thing each time you go (if you plan on going more than once). It's not something I personally would do more than once (unless I got an open bar deal, which they have sometimes). We each tried a different drink so that we could taste each others'. They were fresh and delicious and were served in cups made of ice. The bartender was also outfitted in some cutesy winter wear.There were a few tables and seats made of ice but they were all occupied so we ended up having to dawdle around the standing area. Be careful with your cups! Since they're made of ice and sitting on another ice surface, there isn't much friction which means you might lose your drink.It was definitely a fun experience, v. touristy, and entertaining. I would recommend it.",

    "text": "A friend and I decided to go after class; since our lecture ends at 5pm, we had to hurry and jump on the Tube and and get there before 5:45, the last session of the day that was 13.50 pounds. Why pay more when you can go for the lowest price?We were the first ones to arrive for the 5:45pm session, so we were the first ones inside the bar. A woman helped us get a parka on and we headed in. It was nice being the first ones in since we could snap pictures before it got crowded. The theme was deep sea =) I was dazzled by the intricate design of the ice. By the time we decided to get our drinks, everyone had trickled in. It took us about 15 minutes to get our drinks with people jumping in when people left the bar rather than wait their turn. There were only 2 bartenders, but they were pretty efficient; I watched a bartender make 4 drinks at once.My friend and I each ordered the Absolut Deep Blue (Absolut Peach, Blue Curacao, Watermelon juice); it was really good! I've taken shots of Absolut vodka before and it's rather gross. The combination of ingredients in the Deep Blue made for an enjoyable drink.You're allowed to stay 45 minutes, but after half an hour we were cold and left after we finished our drinks. The parkas keep you warm enough, but the gloves dont. Your glass is made of ice, so you can see how this is a problem...Also, for those of you going for the first time: wear closed-toed shoes and pants!They do have non-alcoholic drinks on the menu, so children are allowed in. I was confused at first when I saw a child, but then I remembered there were juice drinks on the menu. They also have a photographer that goes around taking your picture. You can buy the photo for 10 pounds...",

Got there & queued up (very short), got our cloaks and gloves and headed inside the Ice Bar.You get a complimentary drink with the purchase of your stay in the Ice Bar, so I had the Absolut Ice Bar (formerly named) drink. Everything is made of ice including your glass. Don't go in there asking for anything other than vodka 'cause they don't have it. Although, since the name change this may be different now.The drink was as strong & it needed to be. We walked (stomped our cold feet) around looking at the ice sculptures and sipping our cocktails. You can take pics in here but I recommend you keep moving initially until you acclimate to the cold. You only get about 40 minutes in here, which is plenty of freezing time.Many people started to abandon the ship as they clearly were not keen on being cold for so long. I'm used to NYC winters so I could tough it out.",

Although a sad event as we were saying goodbye to a dear friend as she prepared to make her way back to the States, the food and drinks provided a a great vibe as we all shared each others' dishes and tasted the delightful drinks.The plates are small, but there are so many combinations you can create for a relatively good price. If you request it from the servers, some of them will allow you to mix and match throughout the combos. The price is a little steep for the serving size, but it's a great place to come and try out a couple of great dishes without ending up entirely unable to walk. The drinks are tasty as well. The Chocolatini was a favorite among the table. It was warm, sweet, and had the perfect kick. You could smell the marshmallow, and the way they present the drink is by itself cool.",

Where better to grab one than served in an ice cube in an ice bar!So to start, you have to book. When you book, you get charged \u00a313 for 45 minutes in the bar and you think how outrageously expensive! But then you realise that you get a drink thrown in for that so you think, maybe it's not that bad as long as the drink is ok.We turned up early and ordered a cheeky bottle of wine to be getting along with. \u00a320 for house white?! What a load of rubbish. So was the wine. Not happy.Then we went in and put on our ice fur-lined capes and mittens, which they insist you wear because YOU'RE GOING IN AN ICE BAR. I get that, but you think it can't be that bad, right? Wrong! It's freezing in there!! Of course that's expected I suppose. Also a good thing, otherwise it would be a water bar. Of course I say bar, and there is a bar in there. Also some chairs, tables and cool corner with a photo opportunity wall (of course we took full advantage). But it's quite small and not that impressive. I wish I could say WOW LOOK AT THE ICE SCULPTURES IT'S JUST LIKE FROZEN. No, it wasn't. But it was a gimmick and for that I was happy. The drink was also rather scrummy, if you wanted more drinks it cost \u00a36 more. Probably about what the drink was worth, some pre-mixed cocktails thing you could buy in any upmarket Wetherspoons. I can see why it was only 45 minutes as well. First it's FREEZING in there. I took my mittens off to take some photos and felt like frostbite has set in when I put them back on. Never has going out into lukewarm London been so appealing. Second, there's nothing to do in there. Give it 15/ 20 minutes of photo opps and having your drink and you're done. We stretched it out another 10 minutes because we had a race to see who could lick through their ice cube glass first (thanks so much, I won that one!)So yeah, go along. But don't expect the ice palace. And don't go twice",

Once it's your turn in the actual ICEBAR you all get your own \"Thermal Poncho\", leaving you looking like a character from the old Arcade game Ice Climber. That said, i strongly recommend you wrap up warm before hand, as you're still spending 45 minutes at -7...Once inside, you get your first cocktail for free but have options to buy more, but to be honest, the cocktails themselves are incidental as well as overpriced.Much more fun is trying to put your glass made of ice down on a bar made of ice without it skating away out of reach! The time limit may seem short but it's just long enough to enjoy your drink, pose next to ice sculpture and generally act like a 6 year old on a snow day, but short enough that the novelty doesn't wear off!Overall, well worth the price, and does make for an interesting night out!",

Once we were back upstairs, we stayed for a little while longer at the warm part of the bar. \u00a0However, I didn't order a drink because of their ungodly prices. \u00a0I think one mixed drink was 12 pounds (about 24 US dollars). \u00a0Too much for a lowly college student. \u00a0Prices aside though, it was definitely a great place to hang out if you haven't experienced it before. \u00a0I believe there's only one in the U.S. so if you're anywhere else that has an Ice Bar in your area, try to hit it up! \u00a0Some are quite different than others but they're all pretty neat to experience.",

Their drink selection to choose from is small and very colorful. They highly discourage it, but patrons do drop/smash their ice glass on the floor (it is only ice). They've got colored lights and hit music playing.After we left the ice room, we continued the night in the regular bar area. The drinks are made tasty and strong. They were nice enough to replace a drink that got spilled.I had an awesome time here celebrating my birthday with friends. What topped the night was trying to figure out if that was really Jerry Springer (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Je\u2026) at the other table. Why was he in London and why was he at Ice Bar? My friends started singing 'Happy Birthday' loudly and off key and inserted 'PAY ATTENTION JERRY SPRINGER' and it did sort of work. In the end, I went up to him when he got up and left his table and got a picture with him. Seriously, what an epic birthday and the night was still youngYeah it is pricey, but you should try it once. Its fun- live a little. You may even spot a celeb, who knows.Some picturesstatic.px.yelp.com/bphot\u2026static.px.yelp.com/bphot\u2026static.px.yelp.com/bphot\u2026static.px.yelp.com/bphot\u2026",

    "text": "The first Ice Bar was at the Icehotel in northern Sweden, which was first built in 1989. Each year the Icehotel melts, and a new (bigger and better) one is constructed in the fall. Several years ago, the developer of the Icehotel had an idea of opening a permanent, year-round ice bar in Stockholm. Since then the famous bar has been franchised and you can even find one in Florida. I have been to the London and Stockholm Icebar, in general they are the same, i assume they are all similar. When in Sweden, at the Nordic Hotel the ice bar is attached to, i thought it was an interesting and unique concept. I hadnt realised it was a touristy franchise and thought i had stumbled upon a hidden gem. The bar is essentially a large walk-in freezer. Every surface except the floor is ice. The walls, the bar, the seats even the cups are cutouts of ice. The bar is most proud of the cups in fact, originally they were cut by hand from river ice blocks taken from the pristine, crystal-clear Torne River of northern Sweden. Soon the ice glasses were so popular that a factory and production line were set up to manufacture the frozen glasses. As it must be the bar is cold! As precaution, an unflattering poncho, a cross between an eskimo and star trek outfit, is provided. This garment is not truly intended to warm you however, its mostly intended to protect the ice from you. Further protection from our ice-melting body heat include gloves and sheepskins on seating surfaces. Ready to buy a drink? Hope you like absolut vodka because thats the only choice. Naturally anything else would freeze right? The concept is interesting, the experience is cool (pun intended) for about 15 minutes. As you walk about among all the other similar looking penguins you realise 4 things: 1. Its cold in here 2. Its expensive in here, do i really want another drink? 3. Everyone looks the same-silly. Where is the swedish ski team? 4. Its damn cold in here. Its an experience. Fits into the vegas mold of everyone should go at least once but no compelling reason to return. Makes for a good photo shoot and story. The fact that its been franchised and there is one in Orlando really cheapens the experience into just another touristy theme bar.",

    "text": "I only decided to go to the icebar because my friends were dying to go and were willing to pay for it. I mean, i agree that its amazing how basically the entire bar is made out of imported ice from sweden, but the drinks werent too fantastic and were over-priced. (cover is \u00a315. drinks are around \u00a36-\u00a37...i think.) The experience, on the other hand, was interesting!! ....Or at least for the first 15 minutes. Other than that, the hype pretty much died. I do love how we got to wear cloaks/ponchos that were reminiscent of some high class space colony bar. And there's something intriguing about drinking out of ice glasses! At least i know that my drinks will never get watered down. The downsides: my giant of a friend could not fit the gloves and the poncho was too short for him. Im not sure if you have to specifically request a larger size, but they should have ponchos to fit all types of people. Also, the \u00a315 cover only allows you 40 minutes...which honestly is way more than enough time to be in the bar. Other than that, i wouldnt go again unless i go with someone who hasnt been in one before. But i will admit that its one of those places that you have to try at least once in your life.",

You can eat here if you wish or just chill and listen to the live jazz or just chill in the main bar area. Whatever you decide you will be confronted by a quality feel and you will be made to feel welcome and well looked after. I like this place it really works but it may be a little to touristy for me - I guess that comes with the territory being right next door to the Ice bar. Alternatively it comes with being a grumpy old man ? - give it a go and see what you think, certainly worth a visit and combine it with Ice bar.",

It is what you'd imagine.Bar - You walk in and they take you up (expect people with lists) and then outside the bar area they throw a poncho coat over your head (they do throw it). and then you are in the bar.1 .It is quite cold2. It's for some reason quite blue. Then you hop over to the bar and get a cocktail (limited and uninteresting selection) and drink out of your glass. There are interesting sculptures the walls are covered with ice/ or are a wall of ice. It's a small room - everyone is doing the same - you go in, you have your drink then very quickly you are far too cold and scoot off. Cold/blue/small \u00a0it is what it is \u00a0- I'm glad I went - wouldn't again.-----RestaurantThis was quite good - the food was quite delightful, however the waiters have no idea, and the food wasn't cooked to order. here are the mild frustrations.1. 3 steaks ordered one medium/2 medium rare - they didn't really come cooked to order.2. The steaks that we paid \u00a318 in advance for - had no substantial sides (chips or veg?!) we had to pay on top3. Either the waiter didn't know what the duck egg was (he said it was runny) or the chef screwed up - but i Basically paid \u00a38 for a hard boiled egg...4. 12.5% service charge gets split between company and all staff - just take it off and give a cash tip to the waiting staff. Great food/stingy portions/Not cooked to order/Staff are illinformed, but really friendly.",

Keeping that in mind, I really like my visit to Icebar.I attended a Christmas party of sorts for a company that I don't even work for (long story). They were having cocktails in the lobby area, and booked a 45-minute stay in the Icebar. When the time arrived for us to enter, we were handed giant fluffy parkas complete with attached mittens.The actual Icebar itself is pretty small and absolutely everything is made of ice. It is quite cold inside (no surprise), and the chilly weather didn't exactly work well with my skirt and high heels. If I ever go again, I'll make it a point to wear warmer shoes.The bar was manned by two bartenders and we were given a cocktail menu that offered a decent selection of mainly vodka-based drinks. They're all served in, of course, ice cups. I tried 3 different cocktails - I can't remember their names - and they were all quite good. Vodka at such a cold temperature hardly has a taste, so everything tasted like fruit smoothies . . . except these smoothies got you drunk!The bartenders were quick, courteous, and I have no complaints. It is very touristy though, and I won't be back unless I happen to get invited to another party there. If you're curious about it and have been wanting to check it out, I recommend giving it a go. One visit won't hurt.",

I was excited to come because people were telling me about it and said I should visit there before I leave England. \u00a0First off let me say that the customer service and staff (on the top floor, including security) are so friendly. They were smiling, cracking jokes & very helpful. I would come back just for that alone. I just thought that I would mention that the cloak check is free. The actual IceBar is nice, and it's great for the first 20 mins. But after that it gets boring mainly due to the small room that it is in, make sure you go there with people who can hold good conversation. We got there On a Thursday evening so there wasn't really a wait list, if you make a reservation it is cheaper so consider that and do it days in advance. They place decent music I guess, I wish they added a bit of Top40 ( it would help people get through the 40 minute session). It was cold in there obviously, but it wasn't too bad. The coats they give you are not that thick, so bring your coat. Overall, the actual IceBar was nice, I would only go back in there if I was with people who have never been, so for that I give them 3 stars. The extra star is for the friendly staff, you can have conversations with them & they seem to really enjoy talking to you ( I love people like that).",

    "text": "Don't get me wrong, this place is GREAT. Basically you get 40 minutes wrapped in a fur jacket in a room covered with ice, it's random as hell. What's not to like? Iiiiiiif, you're not delayed. See, I was. I knew i'd be about 15minutes late (I got lost - not proud of it, but I did), so I gave them a call. The response I got was 'well, if you come up 15 minutes late you'll get 20 minutes in there'. Which was fair enough, I cocked up.I managed to get there only 10 minutes late (well recovered I feel) expecting to be quickly whisked into the room to make the most of my remaining 30 minutes.Yeah, that didn't happen. I walked into the empty reception which was manned by two guys, who blanked me and my girlfriend entirely and just had a nice chat. I interrupted them, only to be tutted at and pushed down the hall to the fur coat guys (the reception was pointless).The fur coat guys were fine, once we interrupted their conversation too, we were pushed into a small cold room which let us into the bar itself. When we got in, there was an ok amount of room - you kind of felt like sardines, but it wasn't too much of issue.You got your first drink 'free' - I say free, you already paid for it weeks ago when you book the tickets. So, now your feet are frozen to the floor (literally it felt sticky but your feet were frozen). You have one of there huge range (about 6) cocktails in your (pretty cool) ice glass.This is what you've come for - you're inside THE Ice Bar, and it is really impressive. Multi coloured lighting reflected through ice, TVs behind walls and seats made from a single block.So, the clock on the wall is ominously counting down to 00:00 and you've drank your drink (read half a drink - the cups are TINY) so you want another one. You go to the bar - the service HAS to be fast, you're on a timer after all. NOPE, I waited 5 minutes to be served - there was only one barman in the whole place.Normally, waiting at a bar is pretty standard - 5 minutes is normally pretty reasonable. Not when you're on a timer. I don't really have time to stare at the back of a barman's head when I'm being thrown out in t-minus 15 minutes 43 seconds. Writing this I feel a bit harsh but at the end of the day I paid to go to a bar to experience the amazing ice-covered epic. And at a MINIMUM of \u00a313 per head (if you don't buy a \u00a36.50 drink refill) with about 30 people every 45minutes, you can afford to hire a second barman.Eventually I got served, they don't take card in there so you have to start a tab and pay outside (finally the reception has a use!). The rest of the time was spent talking until at 3-minutes to go, we began to be herded out of the bar itself. They stopped the music and put up the lights. UNIMPRESSED.Overall, this is a cool place to go. It's a nice place to take your girlfriend/boyfriend. BUT it's somewhere you'd only go once. It's a gimmick at the end of the day, after all you can't have a night out in 40 minutes.",

Should you go to this bar once in a lifetime? well for 13\u00a3 why not, \u00a0but do not expect to come back again..The process of accessing to the bar, the person checking your reservations, and the ones giving you the poncho with gloves attached are really friendly and talky, and before entering in the actual bar the atmosphere seems classy but warm.And then you enter in the ice.And then you go into the ice. For real.The bar in s\u00e8 it's nice, the idea of having everything built with ice is nice and everything else, but it's a bit small and without anything to look at... I mean, you build a bar entirely in ice, just put a damn sculpture, something! instead.. it's just a bar, a couple of tables and two benches. But the worst part, and the reason why the number of stars above is just 2, it's the actual bar service: the drink is included with the entrance, and we directly \u00a0went to the bar (well, not that you have many other things to do anyway!).At my question \"Do you have anything bitter?\" The answer simply was \"No, you can choose among these\" pointing at the chart. A chart with less than 10 cocktails. Yes I can read that chart man, the point is that I didn't find anything interesting, that's why I'm asking to you for anything bitter! But no, that's the chart and you can only choose from the chart. Damn. I don't consider it an actual bar service, I mean that's just rude and really, really sad for him.After 37 minutes... Lights go up, and music go down, after 40 a man comes in and tells you to go out.Yeah, great. Thanks Ice bar for the experience, I enjoyed to stay in a fridge for 40 minutes, now I can never come back again.",

But hey, it is what it is. \u00a0Would I go back again? \u00a0Probably not unless with some friends that would have wanted to do it. \u00a0I do recommend to go and try it if you've never been.",

    "text": "Once you have the right expectations about the place, then you can fully enjoy this slightly campy but still neat tourist attraction.Booked tickets online to save a few pounds and arrived early, though there wasn't a huge crowd on a Monday night in September. Five minutes before your scheduled session, you will queue at the entrance. An employee will \"cape\" you with the famous hooded parkas you always see on Instagram, and then you enter the freezer.The tables, bar, walls, and glasses were all made of ice. Cool! You get one cocktail included in your entry price, which were delicious. I got the Turning Torso, which is a lychee flavored vodka cocktail, and my boyfriend got a gin drink. Both were excellent, though small in size. But in the end, you go to Icebar to experience winter wonderland, not to get the best cocktail deal anyway.There's a 40 minute limit which is more than enough to enjoy the surroundings. Even though I was wearing a sweater, jacket, and tights underneath the provided parka and gloves, my toes and fingers were getting numb after a half hour.Overall, I'd recommend this as a unique distraction from the rest of your typical London visit.",

    "text": "Recently, when I cornered a certain politician I needed to interrogate away from Parliamentary Privilege - where he had been protecting some of his controversial statements - this Bar/Restaurant was suggested. I will not voluntarily - but maybe under bright lights and a touch of water torture - give up my source as to who chose this rather 'opulent' rendezvous, other than to comment, that the suggestion was probably made hoping to 'cool' down any remarks I might make in my Newspaper Column.As an aside; I can't imagine many ordinary guys inviting a girl on a date to a place with a name like 'Below Zero.' Unless, of course, he was a chap who had spent time in an Igloo or perhaps was a relative of Sarah Palin - and maybe thought he had a 'cool chick' on his hands. Myself, if I was a guy and hoped that the date would lead to some nocturnal gymnastics afterwards, I think the name of the joint would have deterred me somewhat - I'd have chosen something more in keeping with 'Sweaty Palms', or 'High Voltage.' Maybe 'Nether Regions' would have been more appropriate for a hopeful Lothario.But, as they say, 'what's in name?' In this case it came down to 'What's in the Purse!' Frankly, it wasn't cheap, the booze was the same as you'd find in any classy establishment in town, although rather potent - which wasn't a bad thing, helped to get the old tongue to wag - and apart from the intimate and somewhat dark and plush interior - excellent for furtive foraging - the food was typically and tasty European. However, if you are someone of note, a celebrity or a crook on the run after a big heist, it's the perfect place not to be recognised. Methinks the Kray brothers would have loved the dark cavernous atmosphere. You could get out quickly and it would take the staff an hour at least to find the cold corpse.As for the staff, they were far from cool. Au Contraire. They were a delight and either that way because they could, snatch a quickie at the Ice Bar 'on the house,' or, were deliberately chosen for their personable warmth in order to increase the temperature because of the name of the place.They were more than charming to me - and I didn't even have to flash flesh to get a cherub smile every time a staff member actually found me - without having to use his torch in the dim interior.SUMMARY: Booze - hits the spot. Food far more than passable. Price decidedly heavy, but what else do you expect in Mayfair. Best factors: The d\u00e9cor, and the dark corners.A darling of a place for Spooks, Celebrities or Camera shy Parliamentarians.",

The room itself was a lot smaller than I thought with only space for about 10 people to sit down. \u00a0I didn't feel the cold much apart from on my feet as I was wearing open toed heels!! \u00a0We ended up leaving early (after about half an hour) as we had finished our drink and there wasn't much to do.

So, while in London we found the Absolut Icebar and were really excited.You walk in and they put these huge warm coats on you. There's gloves too. Then they give you a token for a free drink! You walk through the little anteroom and suddenly it is freezing! Everything is ice! The walls are made out of ice. The chairs are made out of ice. The bar is made out of ice. The glasses are made out of ice. Okay, you get the picture. We tried a bunch of fun drinks including my favorite which was a strawberry and cream concoction.I really liked that outside of the ice area there is a normal bar room where you can order some appetizers and have drinks while your fingers thaw- Note: your fingers will only need to thaw if you kept taking off your gloves to touch everything. So, Absolut Icebar is this very fun place that you probably will go to once and enjoy but not frequent every Friday as it is a little pricey and touristy.",

The blocks of ice that make up the wall have been carved internally, which makes sense but wasn't as cool as I had imagined (this was obviously my fault; I was let down because it just didn't match up to what I thought they could have done).Staff- Very friendly but after a couple drinks there, that just wasn't enough to hold my attention so we took off. Good drinks, but I probably won't be going back.**Side note, bring cash! The CC machine doesn't work inside the bar",

Having to wear a foil thermal cape felt a bit space like but obviously was necessary to survive the sub zero temperatures. It did seem insane leaving the cold weather outside to venture into an even colder bar but as it was a private function the free bar was very tempting. I figured that the free vodka shots (served in glasses made of ice) would quickly make me forget that I was in a minus 5 degrees bar. Even though I took full advantage of the free bar I still could not forget how cold I felt. This is probably why staff allow a maximum of 40 minutes in the Ice Bar. The Ice Bar is certainly a cool bar although the usual admission fee of \u00a315 seems a bit steep for 40 minutes in the cold!Definately a great (and freezing) experience!",

(a very sugary cocktail in an ice glass any extra drinks are at a further cost)20 minutes are enough as it is very cold despite the cloak and gloves given to you to wear.When we went there were around 30 people all in the same group and it did feel quite crowded. Its good to do something different and outsid ethe bar there are other bars to relax and warm up in.",

You get one free drink on arrival. (vodka mixes hence Absolut). Note, the drinks are poured into ice cube glasses. So you're drinking from ice. There are ice seats and scultures around. Everything is Ice, the bar everything. You are in there for 20 mins only, so enjoy the experience whilst it lasts! It is -5 degrees all year round. It is a little on the pricey side but worth it.",

I visited the Ice Bar as part of my company Christmas party last year, and I'd highly recommend it (partly because I didn't have to foot the ridiculous bill!). You get a 45 minute slot (trust me, it seems a lot longer), and a metallic blue hooded cape to keep you warm while you're inside. Once your group is together you get herded into a small, rather disappointing ice-walled room. Don't expect an icy maze to lose yourself in! Barmen serve a very limited selection of over-priced cocktails in thick ice glasses. None of this matters. If you're lucky enough to go with a good group of people it'll be a great evening. You'll spend 45 minutes laughing about how silly the whole thing is and taking pictures of your friends in their silly cloaks. The regular bar in the same building is a great way to spend time after your 45 minutes are over. The cocktail selection is great, if a little pricey.",

Once inside, the ice bar itself is quite small and surprisingly cosy, with lots of sculptures and crazy seats and stools to look at. The bar is reconstructed with a completely new design every six months and so repeat visits can still be fun and interesting. After your 45 minutes has flown by you can warm up downstairs in a cosy log cabin-like environment, where there's also a delicious menu \u00a0perfect for winter nights! -They do the occasional Burlesque themed night here too, which are a real giggle and well worth checking out!",

Upon arrival everyone had been given a colour coded wristband which determined which time we would enter the actual ice bar room. The room is quite small but really well laid out and you can also only stay for a maximum of 45 minutes due to the fact that it's -5 degrees in there! Don't worry though, you're given a cosy cape and gloves before you enter to keep you warm.Every year the IceBar closes for a week for a revamp when several tonnes of Swedish ice is flown in and carved by an expert team. This year's theme is IceBar rocks.The first thing that caught my eye was the giant skulls adorning the room. But every wall was carved with some of the most intricate of designs my favourite being the tattooed rock chick whose sleeve housed many famous rock stars within it.The bar was one of my favourite things about the whole experience. Not just the fact that they sold epic cocktails (you all know my soft spot for cocktails and the list is quite impressive here, it took me a while to decide) but the fact that all of the drinks are sold in glasses made from actual ice. Your first cocktail is even included in the cost of your ticket which makes the cost (standard tickets start from \u00a313.50 per person) great value given the novelty value and central location in my opinion.",

It was literally a bar, handful of seats, and two random sculptures of a pineapple and cupcake lol. So once you're inside, there isn't a lot to do, you're just standing around. I also though the drinks would be individually crafted given that the descriptions before entering the bar seemed very elaborate. Nope. All premade. Disappointed. Also really small drinks. The 14 pounds includes a drink and the jacket/gloves at least. I heard the sponsored ice bars are way cooler (Absolut/Smirnoff) so I would do that instead.

We decided to save our p's for once we got into the igloo part and didn't order drinks while waiting.When it's your turn, they throw the special blue cloaks on you along with a pair of wicked mittens. Then it's time to booze and ice skate for the time you have inside. Basically, you take lots of shots -- in ice glasses and with your camera holding, touching, or sitting on other ice objects.Anyone bitching about the price obviously missed the point. This is not your corner pub, it's a novelty attraction. Is admission to a theme park equal to your bus fare?",

There aren't any interesting details carved into the nice. There isn't any history or ice or any special sculptures. Your drink is served in an ice glass, which is cool, but gimicky. Other than the decor itself, there isn't really any effort on behalf of either the staff to provide any entertainment or banter. The whole \"keep your glass\" if you want to order another drink was a little cheeky personally. If you're buying another tiny cocktail, I wouldn't they they would scrimp of the cost of some frozen water.In all, one of those places to tick off the bucket list. I did enjoy my time there. But not enough to recommend to others. If you're already thinking about it though, it's likely worth your time.",

I've seen couples, birthdays and corporate parties book ICEBAR. It's a novelty with imported ice from Sweden and imported guests from all over the world and right here from river city. It's not all tourists. The drinks are not strong but you have your choice of vodka, rum, whiskey and tequila in addition to uncharged champagne. Well booze is quite fine or you can upgrade to premium for \u00a34 more. Not really worth is since the drinks are weak. At least they're not watered down with melted ice.Book on line and enjoy your time freezing your arse off. It's a blast!",

Later, we decide to walk around the city to find something else to do for fun. Then we stumbled into the ice hotel on a rather warm night. For us, there was 0 wait. WE had no idea what to expect. We paid for our admissions and was thrown on some cheezy fake fur clothes. We then got shipped into an ice bar where we had some average vodka base cocktails in an ice shot glass. I wouldn't say it's recommended, must go type of venue... but if you are looking for something silly to do after when you and your buddies are slightly tipsy, it's great fun for pictures and laugh. Should go at least once to check it out if you live in London.",

Cocktails come in an ice glass!! A great novelty but has to be said not fantastic for those of us with sensitive teeth! We didn't feel the lack of our time there- to be honest there's not a lot to do once you've had a couple of drinks and gone round taking masses of photos! I was however a bit disappointed that when the clock on the wall counting down to the end of the session hits 5 minutes that's when the lights come on and everyone is politely reminded it's nearly time to go - instant atmosphere killer.Overall I wouldn't bother to go back (been there done that sort of feeling ) but as a one off experience I was really glad to have tried it!!",

They were very hospitable, whisking the chaps backpack away and donning us in those super stylish capes.The theme of the ICEBAR is frozen food and I love it!! The bar was a frozen goods truck and around the room was a frozen pineapple you were able to have your photo taken in plus a rather delicious looking cupcake!We both tried different cocktails; I opted for the Tropical Sensation that was made up from Absolut Blue Vodka, Blueberry Liqueur, Tropical Fruit Juice, Lemon Juice, and Strawberry Syrup. \u00a0It taste so summery so it was certainly an odd feeling with being so cold whilst drinking it! \u00a0The chap went for the Blue Blazer that was made up from Four Roses Bourbon, Blue Curacao Liqueur, Ginger Ale, and Lemon Juice, and he loved it! \u00a0We had the same cocktails second time around which was a little naughty as we should of tried the others but these were too good to not have again!Once our 40 minute session had come to an end we lined up to get rid of those capes; I'm not gonna lie I'd so own my own one for winter months!We had such a great experience inside the ICEBAR that we decided to continue our night in the warm bar. The cocktail menu is pretty damn impressive and I had to try the Purple Rain concoction. \u00a0It was made up of Absolut Kurant vodka, Triple sec liqueur, Cr\u00e8me de Mure liqueur, blackberry puree, and lime juice. \u00a0The chap isn't a huge fan of cocktails so he went for a Jamieson Whisky and Diet Coke.Once again, the staff were great. I have to say our experience was so enjoyable I can certainly see us going back once they change the ice again, which brings me on to some awesome facts about the ICEBAR...Everything inside the ICEBAR is made out of crystal clear ice harvested especially from the frozen Torne River in Jukkasj\u00e4rvi, Northern Sweden. \u00a0This is due to how clear the water is, and once you've seen how amazing the ice is inside the ICEBAR you'll totally understand why they bring it over all that way! \u00a0They bring specialist sculptors over for 5 days to work on the designs you see, and this happens once a year. \u00a0Every three months they pop back over again to renew the tables and chairs as they get a fair bit of wear and tear!",

It was impossible to get around the room since large groups of tourist or immature college students kept crowding the sculptures in the middle and would not move.

It's very much a \"tourist destination,\" so they're just doing the bare minimum to meet a mediocre satisfaction from customers.It's a nice experience, though.

It turned out to be the coolest bar, literally!!!I found Absolute Icebar by pure coincidence. I just happened to stumble across the bar while roaming around the Heddon St., and I got so excited that there's an Icebar in London as well! I asked the bouncer how the system works, and he told me the cover charge is 16GBP/ person which includes 1 drink price and the guests are allocated 45 minutes slots inside the Icebar. And trust me, you wouldn't want to stay any longer than 45 minutes because it's -5\u00b0C inside!! The interior is all made of ice, and visually stunning with cool colorful lightings. The space is rather small, but there are enough unique visual interests to keep your eyes entertained. Even the cocktails are served in glasses made of ice, but the size is very small. The atmosphere is very hip and tasteful, decorated with funky ice sculptures, definitely worth going at least once for the novelty experience of it!",

Ice bar were excellent hosts and the bite sized food was great, especially the cheese ball croquets (highly recommend). We also were treated to two fantastic cocktails, the blackberry crumble (tasted just like a proper crumble and included the crumbs on top) and a prescco & vodka cocktail (highly refreshing). The Ice bar itself was, as expected, cold! However, the coats and gloves keep us warm enough to enjoy a cocktail served in a glass made out of ice. I had the sucker punch, a run based cocktail, and it did not disappoint. The ice carvings are great and are most certainly worth a quick selfie or, if you can, a group shot. Apparently the theme changes once a year so return visit are a good consideration. Finally, when you're not chilling away inside the ice bar there is a Mini-Club-like space downstairs for guests to thaw out in and also dance away to return the warmth.",

The second occasion was pleasant but I was more sober and the cold had me all shook up lol.Third occasion \u00a0was last night and I was a little bored by it all frankly.I'm aware that they change the theme of the bar yearly but this theme was lacking in excitement for me. No separate ice tables & chairs to sit down on like previous times. Even the bar wasn't as beautiful ... Its a shame but at the same time I know that once you've seen it you've seen it so its never that great the next time as it's so bloody cold!! Its a great first time experience and used to be one of my fav bars but its lost its razzle dazzle for me :(However if you've never been I do suggest you go and experience it! Great Instagram fodder lol",

    "text": "My friend and I went to london for the May bank holiday and we looked for different places to eat and drink. As the ice bar was close to China town we decided to go. When we got there, there was a queue to the door, so we joined it. A member of staff with a clipboard asked if we had a booking which we didn't .. And told us there was space if we came back at 8.15pm, as it wasn't 7pm yet, we pondered on what to do. So we got back in the queue, as she also said speak to reception to see if we could still get in. They have time slots and depending on when people leave the ice bar, as you need to wear the cape and gloves. They only have 30 capes, so up to 30 people go in at a time. Reception said we could go in but will have missed 10 mins, as you get an hour in the bar for the \u00a316 entry fee! So we paid!You wear the cape and go through double doors and go up to the bar where you choose a cocktail as one is included, the rest you pay for. You must wear the gloves to handle the ice glasses! I had s cocktail similar to mojito and it was really nice, could had more! Inside there are sculptures and some seating at the back, but it's cramped with groups of people trying to move round is hard! I could see some people had their shopping bags with them so would been better if they had put into a cloakroom. There is a photographer in there but we didn't have one taken, we just used our own phones. We didn't stay long as my friend wasn't very well so we left within our time slot, so we had done it! Though I had been to an ice bar in Warsaw few years ago!You can eat at the restaurant here though it's not in a ice bar!! I think they accept the tastecard for a discount on food! If you decide to visit the ice bar, book in advance to save all the queuing etc!!!",

In case you've never heard of it - imagine a bar where pretty much everything (walls, bar, glasses) is made out of pure ice.The first thing I noticed entering the bar was the HUGE skull scuplture next to the bar area itself - and you can actually climb inside and peer out from the eyes! At the bar, we were served champagne in glasses actually made from ice (which is where the gloves attached to the poncho definitely make sense) - you can also order yourself a drink from a range of tasty rock-inspired cocktails.I was so impressed with the level of detail that went into the designs - from the tattooed 'rock chick' on the wall to the bar decorated with punky studs - and one of the feature pieces and a total photo opportunity was the Throne of Rock. The blue and purple lighting was wonderfully atmospheric and really emphasised the ice as the light caught and reflected around the room.I did have to pop out for a little bit during the visit to warm up (I'm a ridiculously temperature-sensitive person!), but the temperature in IceBar London is definitely easily manageable for the 40 minute time slot you get and you warm up super quickly afterwards (especially if you pop on a 'wine jacket'). Definitely a quirky night out to show the out-of-towners why London (and Ice Bar) rocks.",

We had a drink at the normal bar then we're called in, had our drink (champagne for an additional 4.5) and took some pictures as there's a 10-15 minute window of time you can stay inside. It was great! Loved the experience. When we exited at 5:30 there was a line of 50 people! Who surely had reservations, so I guess you could say our timing was pretty lucky.

    "text": "As a Londoner, I dismissed the Icebar as a novelty aimed primarily at tourists. As a Canadian, I eschewed it because huddling for warmth in an icebox- and paying for the pleasure- was distinctly unappealing. However, I was recently given the opportunity to experience both the Icebar and restaurant. We've had anything but a conspicuous winter this year and my tolerance for sub-zero temperatures was high- so I took the icy plunge.Upon arrival to the Icebar, visitors are provided with a thermal hooded cape to drape over their shoulders- it's weighty and slightly restrictive, but provides an effective layer of warmth. Bulky mittens are attached to the cape by a cord, but it's impossible to take the requisite photographs with your hands burried in these sheaths. The Icebar itself is a small room where all surfaces are- wait for it- carved from ice. There are some tables and seats, but you'll be lured in by the overtly Instagrammable d\u00e9cor, with features such as imposing skull-shaped ice sculptures, for a plethora of photograph opportunities.Visitors are granted a 40 minute timeslot to take in the frosty surroundings and select a cocktail from a decent menu. The atmosphere is vibrant and the room is dimly lit with plenty of backlighting to emphasise the ice fixtures. An energetic background soundtrack is also provided. It is all a bit of a laugh and something that you'll likely not need to do more than once.After the visit to the Icebar, we were guided downstairs to the restaurant. Staff were organised and we were immediately seated in a quiet corner in the back, giving us a prime vista to admire the surroundings. The setting is surprisingly informal and spacious, with hints of alpine-inspired touches and some private booths lined up against the walls. We were comfortable dressed in jeans and the staff were hospitable, chatty and attentive. We had a particularly charming server who was well-versed in the menu and delivered a complimentary bowl of moreish gordal olives to our table before our starters arrived.The food is relatively uncomplicated and the menu focuses on seasonal ingredients- all at a reasonable price for a central London venue. Upon recommendation of our server, I was swayed by the cured salmon and my boyfriend needed no persuasion to order the slow roast pork ribs. My only grievance was the portion size of the salmon, a sparing cut of fish accompanied with a sprinkling of lime caviar and chopped hazelnuts. It melted in the mouth and I could've happily devoured two more servings. The ribs, conversely, arrived in a more generous abundance to much praise from my boyfriend.Our mains didn't disappoint: the slow cooked stone bass came with the most delicious crushed potatoes that I've ever had, rich and freckled with thyme. The fish was perfectly cooked and delicately served, left to be savoured without an overly dominant sauce. The pickled kohlrabi gave an acidic flavour that resulted in a beautifully harmonious plate. The rump steak, a special on the evening, arrived stacked with a grilled meaty mushroom, glazed shallots finished with a drizzling of a rich jus. We had no room for desert, but did share a bottle of wine from their drinks menu, which had a good range of fairly reasonably priced wines.So, even if you do bypass the frivolous fun of the Icebar itself, the restaurant is a pleasant surprise. It offers a casual and relaxed atmosphere for a relatively reasonable price for central London where you won't feel rushed or encroached upon other diners. \u00a0You'll also feel looked after by the waiting staff, who were exceptional during our visit. \u00a0As a standalone, the restaurant is definitely a solid contender for a good quality meal out in the city. But why wouldn't you want to make a night of it and stick your face through an ice sculpture?",

    "text": "When I discovered the Icebar while looking for fun things to do in London, I knew we had to give it a try!First, it is important to note that their restaurant doesn't open until about 3 or 4 for food. You can start your tour of the Icebar at around 2 PM on a weekday. We bought two tickets for about 30 pounds. The ticket comes with a free cocktail and then 40 minutes in the Icebar (which is way longer than you need to be in there). I ordered the Pineapple Express, which was delicious. The serving was a little small, but it comes in a glass that is made entirely out of ice, which was cool. They give you a warm coat and mittens to go in, but I'd still dress rather warm for the experience. I had on sweatpants and tennis shoes and still only lasted about 15 minutes in the Icebar. Kudos to those who can last longer.After the Icebar, we were able to check out happy hour in the bar. We ordered a bottle of the Chile Merlot, which was only 12 pounds during happy hour. We also ordered the duck fat fries for 3.5 pounds, which were good but I couldn't really taste the duck fat. Definitely something you should check out in London. It was a very unique experience and there are some good specials in the bar during happy hour.",

Definitely true to the igloo theme and ambience, but I wish they had more of an entertainment or distraction apart from just blocks of ice. I really enjoyed my drink. It was served in an ice cube as well which was fun to drink out of. Overall, enjoyed the experience -- solid place and time.",

For most people though, the cosy capes seemed more than enough to keep them warm as we posed next to the ice, stroked the ice, and my boyfriend tried to melt an imprint of his hand into the ice (pretty sure it's not going to happen). Had an absolutely fantastic evening here, good - and interesting - food, cocktails that tasted like blackberry crumble, and shots like pressed apple juice. Thanks ice bar!",

    "text": "Icebar is such a cool place (obvious pun intended). I wanted to come here for my birthday while I was up in London seeing a show last year. We turned up and it was a Monday in June so we didn't need to book, however hadn't realised there are set time slots so we had to wait about 20 minutes to go in which wasn't too bad.I would say the only reason to come here is for the experience. I'm pleased to say I've gone but I wouldn't go again unless it was for a friends birthday or other arranged event. The fun of it is putting on the insulated poncho and the gloves and waiting to go in being told \"now its very cold in there...\" and you think pah, sure, they can't freeze us...They do. Everything in there is made of ice, from the bar, seats and tables to the glasses you drink from. You get one cocktail with your ticket which really isn't enough and they are fairly expensive to buy after that. But pretty damn tasty! Once you've had your cocktail, its basically time to take a gazillion photos and post them on Facebook or do the standard check-in. Of course, the gloves are so huge you get frostbite taking them...or you ask another poor soul if they wouldn't mind taking a group shot of you.My mum was blissfully unaware that the whole thing would be ice cold so she wore sandals. (it was June after all) She. Froze. I don't know how she did it but we managed to stay on there for the full 45 minutes. It was really empty when we went with only about 4 other couples, so I imagine the atmosphere is much better if it is busier near winter. All in all, definitely recommend coming here once when you're in London, but come prepared. Wear actual shoes with socks, book a slot if you're coming in peak time and maybe get some touchscreen sensitive gloves.",

You can have drinks or a bite to eat with friends in a more heat inclined atmosphere before taking part of the ice experience. We ordered appetizers and a bottle of champagne before heading in to the actual ice bar. Upon entry you get an insulated hooded \u00a0cape w/ mittens to keep your hands warm. Entry includes 1 drink. It was cold but not unbearable and being intoxicated sort of balanced it out. Me and my girls had an amazing time and even met some people who were visiting from other countries who suggested they'd found the place through Yelp.

This added unnecessary time to the process.As I was part of a larger group we waited until everyone arrived before going in however our time was limited to the ticket start time. Thus we only got 30 minutes inside.It's a very small room full of ice with one bar. Drinks are small as well. That said, the ice sculptures are cool and music is pumping loud. It is very cold even with the coat and gloves they provide so you don't want to stay too long.There is a warm bar to hang out before or after your allotted time in the ice bar.

Weak drinks make the small room even more awkward as people just want to take pictures and leave. They must know people like pictures, and yet the lighting is still terrible. I will say that the drinks are tasty, and overall it's a cool concept, but not really worth the hype.

Downstairs there's a modern and cosy restaurant along with a vibrant bar which is divided by a internal wall - which is great as you can have your meal and then grab a cocktail. Cocktails are very impressive - check out the photos. Even though one would think that London has great cocktail bars, there more rare than common. ICEBar is a great place Ice Experience is brilliant and should be checked out!! They have different themes, though when I was there, they has Wild In the City - loads of fun. Each piece of ice has been transported from the North of Sweden, thus all individual with river marks and unique features. I was the ice cave (as I like to call it) for about 20 minutes. You can get drinks in a pure ice cup, though before you start thinking about it; no, you can't take them home....just \u00a0think about it ;-) Their Bar at the entrance level is chilled place to have a drink after enjoying all the above, or even if you haven't, you can still stop in for a drink without having to do any of the above. As most bars in this areas are too full, or too expensive, ICEBar is definitely the place to go if you want a more civilised place to chat with friends within the area.100% recommend ICEBar for events, dates, groups of friends and almost every occasion.",

What makes this a must for those who want something quirky is it's controlled environment. Where else can you find an ice bar in London that delivers quality as well as fun from the clear ice that is delivered from abroad to the rotating theme they have throughout the year.

Apparently it's really good for third dates - I wouldn't know though as I'm happily married and was long gone from the dating market. The Ice room is made of ice from sweden and it's really cold, so they give you a cape and gloves. The fun thing though is that you drink from a cup made out of ice! I thought it was quite a novel experience (being from a Tropical country) and not wanting to be in the cold for a long period of time. The reception room downstairs is also a really good function room. We threw the Yelp Unofficial Community's Launch party at the downstairs reception and Icebar had some great cocktails and canape style food which was very tasty. You can also have a DJ in there, and there's a bar area and a breakout space to do some stuff like face painting. It was fabulous. For private events, you can even have a private entrance that goes straight into your downstairs reception so it really feels like an exclusive venue. Would definitely recommend for party organisers and as a normal customer :)",

Drinks are actually more size-wise of a shot thing, and drinks are more of a juice (rather than an actual alcoholic drink). It is not to substitute your usual drinking nights; more of a one time experience and that's it. Expensive but your entrance includes a free drink and you then have plenty of time for your usual instagram iced photos!",

Other than it's good location, there was nothing too special about the experience.It was expensive (forty pounds total) for about 45 minutes inside the bar. I was eager to go in and expected way more from the atmosphere and the drinks. It was a small room, crowded with a lot of other people with only a few ice sculptures. Our entrance fee to get inside included one complimentary drink in an ice cube. Although they provide gloves and a poncho, it is quite cold and after about twenty minutes we ended up leaving - also didn't want to pay 11-15 pounds for another drink. It was just a little boring and I would have rather spent my money elsewhere!",

Such a cool place not just because it's -5\u00b0C. \u00a0Actually, that is not as cold as you think, if you are well wrapped. I have experienced colder -15\u00b0 to -23\u00b0 before in Seoul and Moscow :-)We started downstairs with an assortment of \u00a0delicious canapes ranging from pork skewers to mini burgers to blue cheese balls, to parcels of chorizo and mustard, to parcels of pumpkin and goats cheese, and little glasses of prawns, jelly and cream on top. All washed down with cocktails or wine or beers. \u00a0I had a berry crumble cocktail, unusual, but I liked! \u00a0Beautiful face painting was also being done in one corner by the lovely face painter, Joanne of Jojo's face painting. \u00a0I asked for a butterfly in keeping with the inner animal theme, well, I am a \"social\" butterfly! \u00a0Then in groups according to our coloured wristbands, we went upstairs to the Ice Bar, the highlight of the evening. \u00a0A cape, with gloves attached, was put over our heads, which kept you quite cosy, before being let in to roam around the ice bar room. \u00a0It was fun trying to drink cocktails of vodka, bourbon or rum in square glasses made of real ice, without it slipping out of our hands! The cocktails had some great names. \u00a0I had a Horny Rhino. Very nice indeed. After 20 minutes of marvelling at the ice and beautiful ice structures and enjoying the experience, our time was up, and the capes were whisked off.Back downstairs more wine and canapes and the winner of the best photo was announced. Well done Paul S. \u00a0An inspired photo! Then the Arctic parrot, as worn by Livi S, won the best animal costume in keeping with the ice theme! We all had such fun, and that was not the end, we also all got a goody bag to take home too. \u00a0Thanks so much Carl and all the team, for making this a most enjoyable evening for everyone. \u00a0Very well organised! \u00a0Surely, this is a must place for any party, casual and fun!",

    "text": "The ice bar is a great concept drinking in a very cold enclosed area out of glasses made out of pure ice amongst ice sculptures. This year the ice sculpture theme is based on animals. However there was not many animals to be seen out of ice only really on TV screen.Before entering the ice bar you are given a big cape with hood and gloves to wear so don't worry about getting too cold. The cocktails are quite good maybe a slightly too sweet but still they were good. You use the same glass that is made out of pure ice throughout your experience. Even though fun I think I would of loved to of seen more ice sculptures. I properly would not go back as I feel once you have done it you have done it and as I said before the drinks were not fantastic just ok. However if you have not done it then I do recommend doing it as it a laugh and an experience.",

First off, the bar is a little hard to find as it's in some side streets... not really a problem but I bet they'd be more popular if they were on a main road. Anyways, we arrived early for our 6:50PM reservation. We had a drink at the warm bar while we waited and the drinks were very good and strong. We got in line when our time arrived and there were about 20-25 people who also made the same reservation. They gave us these blue parka looking things and let us go in for our allotted 40 minutes. Seriously, the place is SOOOO COOLLL. The actual ice bar area is not very big and no one actually sits down and chats like a regular bar... mostly, we all just marveled at the ice designs, got a few more drinks, and took selfies. We actually left after 30 minutes because it was SOOOO cold but we didn't feel slighted or that we didn't get our money's worth. Apparently, they do different designs each September-ish and this year was Icebar Rocks (rock music). I guess they close down for a week while they change the theme so I am excited to go back later this year (or next year) for another round!!!",

We had the whole of the basement for the launch where there was free food all night long, free cocktails and in the corner a face painter to turn us into animals. There was a chance to mingle with other yelp reviewers as well as local company owners. There was also the ability to go upstairs into the ice bar and experience the -5 degrees Celsius bar. \u00a0It was a lot of fun to put on the coat and gloves and walk into the freezing cold bar. Unfortunately I didn't manage to stay in there long but it was so cool to be there.We also were able to sample the cocktails on offer and they were yummy.There was a competition for best dressed and best photo. The whole atmosphere of the night was one of friendship with everyone chatting to everyone else. Lastly the night ended with a goodie bag of amazing gifts. The ice bar is such a unique venue. Well worth going along an experiencing drinking in sub-zero temperatures.",

Last week was fun as it was a themed launch party so people had to dress up as wild animals. I dressed up as a tiger! On arrival we were given a wristband to allocate time slots for the icebar not before being lead downstairs to where the two rooms where. There was a open bar with complimentary cocktails, wines and beers and a variety of canapes given out in the first room and in the second room there was complimentary facepainting and seating.I went to this launch event with another yelper and we enjoyed sipping on the delicious cocktails and canapes. We where stuff by the end!! The staff was welcoming and informative too. As the event continued there was a welcome speech and then each group was lead back up the stairs too the icebar where we lined up to get given our hooded jacket and gloves. Inside we where surrounded by ice sculptures and the icebar where there was a cocktail menu and complimentary cocktail given out. Each cocktail poured into an actual ice glass. The session last about 30/40mins and we then were lead out and helped to take off our hooded jackets. Good experience but time went quick for me poss due to taking alot pics and chatting!Overall, a great experience - for me, being in the actual icebar would be a one off experience but would deffo come back for the cocktails at the main bar.",

It was my second time at an ice bar, my first time being in Christchurch, so I can only compare it to that.I have to say my favourite feature was that the ice bar had a large 'regular' warm bar area which was nice and warm, while still being big and inviting. This was different that my first ice bar experience which was just an ice bar. As fun as it is, it's not somewhere you want to be for a long time. We got a time slot for the ice bar, which was for 45 minutes. When entering, we were given a thermal poncho, with some cut outs for our arms. The bar changes its theme often, and at the time I went, the theme was wild animals, so there were some great ice cultures around this. We also got one drink while in there, which was served in a very cool ice glass. Back in the warm bar, I had one of the best cocktails I have ever tried, which had berries and a really nice pie-like taste to it. I absolutely loved it, and really want to go back for more. The canapes we had were great as well, so don't hesitate to order food while you are there. This is a space where you can have a large group or party, perfect for different functions.Overall, I really enjoyed my visit to the Icebar London and will be returning.",

There was a special deal during the week for this set up, which would have been great, but unfortunately they wanted to charge me about \u00a330/head up front. I couldn't afford to cover that for all 10 of us, so we just made reservations for the bar itself.Thought this still meant that we had to put down a deposit, it was reasonable and I was happy to cover it. We arrived at a specified time and dressed up like little eskimo spacemen, which was wholly amusing. I wondered prior to arriving whether it was an 'over the coat' job and if I'd need to bring gloves. Turns out, the thermal cape fitted nicely over my thick jacket, and I was provided with thermal mittens that are built in. I didn't get cold at all, which surprised me considering we were sitting on blocks of ice covered with furs.\u00a315 allowed us entry for 45 minutes, and gave us a free drink (a vodka based cocktail in an ice cup). The refills were pricey at \u00a37 a pop, but you can't really knock up too much of a bill in such a short space of time. It's a novel way to spend an evening, with plenty of photo opportunities and is most definitely worth a visit. The night remains a conversation starter to this day, but is best enjoyed in a big group I think.Worth noting that the decor changes with every season. It was 'Disco Elvis' went I went, but you'll get a different theme every 3 months.",

However, no worries. Upon entering this place, you pay (duh) and they let you borrow a heavy-duty poncho and gloves. So you wear that over your clothes and then enter the icy bar. It's definitely one of those touristy things you do.. wear ponchos in an ice bar, have a couple of drinks, and then skedaddle, b/c even with the poncho and a few drinks, it's still quite cold in there. It's definitely not one of those places that you hang out to chat it up... unless, you're an Eskimo.",

I suppose you want that time limit or else who knows what can go wrong after you \u00a0really get hammered, inside a refrigerator.  \u00a0Worst part, I tried to bring back the glass they served my Vodka in.

You got to pick a vodka drink from the menu and it was served in an ice glass, re fills where free if your glass lasted long enough.

Having said that, there is an outside heated area and a 'warm' bar as well. It's in a good location with plenty of eating and other drinking places around.

The seats are made of ice, as is the tables and there are large cogs cut into the walls (for some reason). We got a drink included in the price and I went for a strawberry creamy type thing.

This time I wanted the radioactive drink but the lady wouldn't wash out my glass for me, (I say 'glass' - really i mean 'ice' as the drinking recepticeles are also made of ice) telling me I could buy another one at a price of \u00a34. Having watched some of my recepticle melt already I felt \u00a34 to rent the solid state of water seemed a bit steep and as the bar lady stirred my drink with some sort of radioactive stick, I felt that the strawberry remenants of my previous drink were probably the least of my worries!

Maybe dressing cute isn't the way to go either because they give you an extraordinarily big warm cape that also smells really bad. It covers anything cute you are wearing. The great thing about this place is they do have unique, strong drinks. They also taste really good. You'll never know there was any alcohol in it until you start feeling it a bit later. It's a concept bar so that kind of gives it a cool factor as well. I mean really, are you planning on transforming your bedroom into an ice room. Probably not. So give it a try.

The moment I walked in I realized that a little bit of hell wouldn't be too bad it was so freakin cold. But I could see why people are drawn to this place, it's really cool and it's something I will never forget, you can say that the memories are frozen in my mind. The drinks are steep but then again it is from a glass that can only be used once before it melts.An eskimo for a day with friends was worth the cold, next stop the Ice Hotel in Jukkasj\u00e4rbi, Sweden.",

    "text": "The Ice Bar was a lot of fun, selection of 20 drinks from the menu and the staff very pleasant & friendly. 4-Star but read below After our chilled fun in the Ice Bar we were ready for Belowzero. Started off with the waiters taking too long with our drinks, in fact we made a dent with the bottle of water before our cocktails and wine arrived. The Cocktail: Ordered two Hibiscus Royale and we got two glasses of Champagne with raspberry juice, which isn't a cocktail on the menu. Later, I quizzed the barman over this cocktail and the replay was the Hibiscus is too expensive for them to use. THEN WHY SAY 'Hibiscuc Royale' on the menu? Change it!! The Wine: Ordered a bottle of Pinot Grigio, which arrived warm... they did have it in an ice bucket 1/3 filled with water and a few ice cubes in it. I had to ask for more ice in the ice bucket and the wine as chilled right when we finished our main course. Suggestion for those of you going to the Ice Bar first, order and take your white wine with you to chill for \u00a0hour. The Food: Arrived cold, not warm but cold \u00a0cold duck isn't my favorite dish but the side vegs were warm. Overall, it's a tourist trap style restaurant, not good service, poor quality of food for that price and very poor quality on drinks service",

(haha, it gets quite cold especially if you were wearing sandals like me)One thing I learned going here is to NOT SMASH THE ICED GLASSES they give you. It'll get you kicked out so fast! We apologized for not knowing any better and you can guess how unhappy even the people at the cloak stand were with us. \u00a0hahaThis was definitely a memorable experience!",

    "text": "Everyone knows what an excellent idea the invention of ice cream is. It's the perfect meeting of happiness, joy and cold. The same can be said, to a lesser degree, of the Absolut Ice Bar near Oxford Circus. It's a great, if frozen idea, and worth the \u00a315 entry fee. This will get you the coldest 40 minutes you've ever experienced and a free Absolut drink in a glass made completely of ice. The place is kept at a temperature of minus eight degrees Celsius and my first mission was to try get my tongue stuck to one of the icy carvings. Then I thought about how many other people as to how many other people had possibly tried this and sent my tongue from whence it came, quickly. The Ice Bar itself is quite small, and is complemented by a stylish normal bar for when the cold gets a little too much. You are given a combination of gloves and a big snowman jacket when you go in. I would love to see who is brave to decline this: even though I was dressed for the full onslaught of the British winter I still felt frozen even wearing the huge Ice Bar jacket. I sipped on my Absolut drink, hoping it would fill me with warmth. Sadly it did not. This bar is a must-see attraction, though once you've been you're likely not to return too often.",

The ice bar is kept permanently at minus 5 degrees, and every 6 months the design is changed to give it a new look. It is so popular in London that you have to book online to sample this new bar.It is the brainchild of a Swedish entrepreneur who has made everything from the waters of River Torne- a very famous Swedish river. Entrance costs 12.00 pound per person and with that you alsoget a thermal cape and a hood to keep you warm in case it gets too cold. You are allowed to sit in the bar for upto 40 minutes at a time in case you freeze to death.",

I studied abroad and one weekend we all decided to go to the Icebar. A lot of people skipped out because of the expensive cover charge, but I thought the experience was well worth the money. For 16 pounds, you get 40 minutes inside the bar fully made of ice \"from North Sweden\" and a drink. The drinks were small, but this isn't the place to get wasted at. Going here is one of my most fond memories of London--it was so fun! I never expected it to be so fun. Be sure to wear socks and shoes because your feet get super cold! You won't want to stay the full 40 minutes either, but the time you do spend there will be really fun. Well, if you've never been to an icebar that is. I wouldn't mind coming back or trying out another icebar back at home after going to this one.Even waiting in line and watching other people get \"hooded\" was exciting. The parkas and gloves they give you are not dirty and keep you warm the whole time. Well, except your feet. My friend who wore sandals wasn't having that much fun. \u00a0Anyway, I recommend that it's a touristy thing that everyone should try :)",

Although the ice bar still has a big queue, seven of us could get into below zero and got a table to sit.3. Its not too loud. Check. The music was nice and soft and we could hear each other, which is too much to expect in most pubs in the area at that time.4. Nice cocktails. Check. Not too expensive also. I had a white chocolate (with vodka and some white version of Baileys) and a bellini. They make it well and are not stingy with the alcohol.5. Good service. Well, we were too drunk to notice anything about the service.On the whole, a very good place to come to post your friday night parties.",
