    "text": "I am completely in love with this place, and so happy that Viajante's replacement is such a standout. Nuno has done it again. Yup, it's in a former firehouse. This new space is warm and sexy and has a sense of place -- similar to Viajante. Now that it's less of a trek to get to, it seems to be a magnet for famous people. But you should go here because it is great and lovely. The ceiling looks like it is covered with the burlap strap woven bottoms of the seats of antique chairs. Sit at the \"chef's table\" (the bar) and watch the action at a 10+ foot long stove, custom made by some company in America. Getting that shipped out must have been quite an undertaking.The cocktail list is incredible. I was waiting for my dining companion and enjoyed what I believe was called \"love in a cold place\" -- all of my favorite things in a glass. I'd had the Iberico pork steak at one of the Portuguese nights at Viajante, and it was great here, too. Sadly no frozen olive oil candies, but they do give you some chocolates to finish the meal.Gluten-free notes: Many (half or more) of the dishes on the menu are gluten-free. They know what gluten is and can help you out. Unfortunately no freshly baked cumin rolls like Viajante had.",

    "text": "It was our second last night in London and we were looking for chic London cuisine-Both Foursquare and Yelp pointed us towards The Chilton Firehouse. \u00a0After zigzagging through the streets for quite a while we finally found it. \u00a0Speaking to the Maitre d' we were lucky enough to secure two seats at the chef's table. We were greeted very warmly by Rafal who would be our server for the evening. \u00a0We started out with a wonderful full bodied Italian red. The first course chosen was the crab stuffed donuts which proved to be light and delicious. \u00a0The second course chosen was the pumpkin porridge-truly fantastic with hazelnuts and chestnuts on top. \u00a0Perfect balance! Growing up eating wild game my father hunted I was thrilled to find venison on the menu which was enthusiastically encouraged by Rafal. It was such a pleasure to watch the hustle of the kitchen as everyone worked fluidly to create some exquisite looking plates-every dish was tended to like a work of art! The venison(ordered medium rare) did not disappoint! Smoky, juicy and balanced out with a pecan pesto and a teriyaki-glazed chard. Every bite was beyond delectable! After asking us a few questions, Rafal suggested the frozen apple pannacotta for dessert and it couldn't have been more perfect! Rafal's charm and wit made our experience incredibly enjoyable. As the meal came to a close Rafal brought a picture perfect cappuccino that tasted as perfect as it looked. Shifting to the bar for a nice after dinner drink-a special Zacapa rum was chosen. The bartenders were equally wonderful, charming and a joy to watch as they mixed endless cocktails with precision and ease. Our experience will be talked about for a very long time! THANK YOU!",

They told us we had to be finished in 2 1/2 hours which was a pity because we would have stayed on and had desert and more drinks. I'm not a fan of restaurants that move you out, especially if you're spending big as we were. Cocktails were very nice. Starters of crab donuts and octopus were excellent but main courses were just ok. Maple sweet potato mash was the consistency of baby food and far too sweet. Could only taste maple. Sadly, all the food was totally over salted. The whole table said so. Apart from the crab donuts (which were gorgeous), octopus and maple mash everything, without exception was salty and this is coming from people who love highly-seasoned food. Still, service and atmos was good enough that we'll be back. Also, it's a shame they save the pretty courtyard as a \"sacred space\" for hotel guests. It remained more or less completely empty whereas we could have been continuing our evening and spending money!",

    "text": "My friend managed to snag this booking months in advance- don't ask me how it's done! London's hottest restaurant is frequented by celebrities who hail from near and far. Unfortunately on a Monday night, none of them were in sight, but the paparazzi were camped outside the entrance nonetheless. Upon arrival, I was greeted by no less than 5 members of staff before I even reached the hostess, and I was shown to my table immediately to await my friends. They have a lovely cute drinks/snack menu for those who are waiting, and the starters on there are different than the proper starters you can later order with dinner. And the one thing that struck me is that Chiltern is surprisingly affordable- you can get a glass of wine for \u00a35, a bottle of wine for under \u00a325, starters for \u00a315ish, desserts for under \u00a310, and mains are in the \u00a325-30 range generally. We ordered the crab-filled doughnuts as a snack and got the Grenache blanc for wine... I don't think you can go wrong with the wine list, it's just a matter of price, and the doughnuts came highly recommended and the innovation did not disappoint. \u00a0As a starter, I ordered the grilled octopus (served with aubergine, daikon, and mushrooms) with a lovely miso sauce. One of my friends ordered the sea trout crudo, which was basically sashimi served with some sort of fish roe (I am not into that, but if that is your sort of thing, you'd probably like it). For my main, I got the spring lamb, served with black garlic, goat's curd, and grilled lettuce. The goat's curd was interesting... it was like a sour cream kind of taste and texture. Unfortunately one of my friends ordered the roasted turbot and she got food poisoning later in the night, and we think that is the reason why. And for the dessert, there is a frozen panna cotta that was positively divine... you definitely have to try it! I also had the tokaji dessert wine which was the perfect finish. Overall, it was a great experience, but I just had to mention the food poisoning but I hope the restaurant makes amends! Other than that, the venue is surprisingly normal and there is no need for normal people to be intimidated :)",

I ordered an appetizer salad as an entre as I wasn't expecting many vegan options so that was fine. Our table ordered a few bottles of wine to share and we had a really great time. Chiltern is definitely more for the experience (the decor is beautiful and the staff are amazing) than for the food but most of my friends thoroughly enjoyed what they ordered as well.

We'd barely been sat down two minutes before they had rushed over to take our order, and the food was as quickly set onto the table in front of us. \u00a0 Honestly, I can't fault the food - it was well presented, well cooked and tasted lovely, however I wouldn't say it was any better than some other cheaper restaurants in London. When you're paying such a high price tag, you would expect something a little more mind blowing than what we were served. The champagne cocktails were probably the highlight of the meal, while the coffee was weak and a little tasteless. \u00a0 Would I recommend this place? Sure, if only for the experience of saying you've been and done a little celeb spotting while you were at it - but sadly I feel that's probably the best feature of the place.",

    "text": "To say it's hard to get a booking is an understatement. I had to wangle a reservation from someone in the know for me and my friends.PROS:- You might see a celeb.- The bar waiting area is very nice.- The starters. The Venison Sausage Rolls was flavoursome and tasty. The Crab doughnuts. Now these were raved upon by many upon research and they are OK.- They have some lovely house wine (so much so we continued to drink another bottle after)- We sat at a table but the area where the chefs cook you can sit at.- The Garden as you enter. Sat outside after eating and enjoying over hearing conversations amongst the rich.- It's situated in a lovely area of Marylebone. Right opposite one of my fav places to unwind (Monocle Cafe).CONS:- The tables all feel a bit too tightly compact to one another.- It all feel a bit stiff. Maybe it feels like the place to be seen rather than a place to go eat well. And I really couldn't wait to dine at somewhere Nuno Mendes was head chef.- The eggs Benedict. Biscuit instead of muffin. I really would prefer a posh English muffin than an American dry biscuit. Disappointed to say the least.- The Lobster Scrambled Eggs. Was horrible in all honesty. One way of ruining an expensive ingredient with one of the most simple. Avoid.The problem with places like this is that the 'buzz', 'hype' and 'reputation' sometimes proceeds itself. And for those prices and mark up it is not worth it in terms of value. Unless of course you saw David Beckham or some world star perhaps... ;)",

My last trip through the UK and it's my first meal in town after a long ass flight. My hotel isnt ready so i get on the tube and lo and behold the station i need is closed. Ive got a large backpack and jacket and as i exit the next station to circle back and then walk a few K its getting hot. Of all the times in London for this to happen..I walk to the streets and finally get there. Im shown to a space that is looking right at the pass. Perfect. Ive been up for 20 hours and can finally settle. It turns out my server is an ex Dinex guy and worked for Daniel and his mix of restos in NYC. Good start. Im watching as they furiously plate and cook, and expedite. This is a furiously busy kitchen. I then meet Sebastian one of the sous chefs and he's talking about his time traveling, cooking and finally ending up at Chiltern. He makes some suggestions and im on my way. For some reason there's a mix up and someone \u00a0approaches with a Bloody Mary. Ive been up way too long but im sure i didnt order it. But What the hell i said id take it anyways if it didnt belong to another ticket. I dont generally like them but realized after how excellent the first sip was that ive been drinking sub par ones for who knows how long. Score.My food starts coming out and a couple of older dodded up ladies sit near me then start complaining about how they want a booth and were disappointed in that thats what they shouldve had. My server takes it graciously and says he'll talk to the reservationists. They are moved soon after. Thank goodness. Dont think i could have dealt with that. I have a chat with my server and he says the place has become somewhat of a hot spot and that people come to be seen and watch. As someone who's here for a Michelin starred chefs cooking, the best seats are at the pass! Soon a gentleman is sat next to me and we agree on the same topic. Turns out he's just as obsessive with food as i am and is a regular here. I recommend the carrot dessert which is unusual, complex and ultimately delicious. We are now food allies.Aside from the carrot dessert, the beef and veggie hash and the dry aged burger and fries are fantastic, comforting and have their own delicious twist. Service was excellent and as someone who is not famous and was treated very well. I think having a rapport with the kitchen also helped greatly but when it's about the food, that's how you focus. I guess if youre a scene person, just dont act like those ladies...",

It could do with some signposting or a person guiding patrons through. Though we had a reservation at 2:00- we were told to wait for 25 mins. \u00a0When we were sat I promptly ordered the peach mint champagne spritzer. It didn't end up arriving until after the food which was crazy- also served in a highball glass which I felt the presentation could have been better. The food was flavoursome but portions are small for the price. I ordered the eggs florentine and my friend ordered the eggs Benedict. The eggs florentine was flavoursome but I can't attest to saying it was anything out of the ordinary. My friend and I shared a stack of the pancakes which we both enjoyed and we were glad we ordered as did not feel full from our egg dishes. Service was consistent and decor inside is lovely however I wouldn't rush to come back here- expensive and nothing out of the ordinary.",

    "text": "Booking: Either the mass panic bookings of 2014 have passed, or I was one of the lucky ones that didn't seem to have a problem getting a table for Dinner at Chiltern Firehouse. Was offered a place at the Chef's Counter on the phone, which I took (and recommend you ask for!). Arrival: Staff were friendly and courteous, and we grabbed some champagne at the bar while our table was being readied. Apart from quite a few Russian oligarchs, the bar was wells stocked with 12, 18 and 25year Japanese whiskeys, and some decent champagne options.Searing: We were originally sat at a normal table, but pushed correctly to be placed as booked at Chef Counter. CC is a little less formal, and requires sitting on a high stool with less leg room; so if you have a long leggy date (in a dress or otherwise) you may want to save it for next time. That said, it's the best table at the Firehouse; watching the speed and precision of the appetiser area, with the giant meat grill & smoking each behind, was a great conversation piece. The chef's ears perked up while we were chatting about what he was doing, and gave us a taste while explaining everything. The man was insanely busy, so that small gesture was truly special.Food: + Crab Donuts have a well earned reputation as a 'must have'. Only three of them but delicious.+ Streak Tartare: a late summer sun sat on the tartare, that you beat into each other to give a very rich dish. The Firehouse hot sauce, a smoked spicy apple flavour, was insanely delicious. I would literally buy bottles of it alone. + Calamari: now off the summer menu, it was still delicious, fresh and not even remotely rubbery.+ Main: credit to the waiter, he recommended we share the day's special of 300g Wagu beef with a wasabi-yogurt sauce and rocket salad (possibly as it was also \u00a378). We paired it up with the Maple-Bourbon Sweet Potatoes (which is a mash, not fries). All I can say is the beef was succulent and tender, perfectly medium-rare; but the sweet potatoes mash- my god. Nearly too sweet, but I was licking (secretly) the copper bowl it arrived it (which is straight from the hot plate, so watch out). More. I wanted more. +/- Dessert: Key lime pie was lovely. The hint of bitterness was exactly what was needed after the rich meal. My companion had re fudge cake; a classic, but didn't blow me away. Tastes differ I guess! + Wine: Glass of Pecorino, my choice and the waiter's favourite (being Italian). + Service: solid and attentive. Waiter recognised me from somewhere else and told me at then end of the night, which was nice, and didn't mind having a conversation that didn't make you feel he was being nice for the sake of tips. - Other: exit later in the evening is out the side entrance by the hotel, though a franky dull corridor near the hotel area, into the side street. Just... Why? Makes you feel you are being turfed out into the gutter. Secret suggestion: find the smoking area past the toilets with the lipstick all over it. Meet some celebs. There are other bits, but unless you are a master class blagger or engine celeb, g'luck :)",

The outdoor area was fairly empty but hostesses insisted on seating us in a walkway. We finally ended up with a decent table thanks to our server and persistence from my husband. \u00a0Service was good but slow. Started with super stiff excellent drinks -- gin & tonic and old fashioned. Had to have second each despite generous pour. Then shared spiced watermelon, steak tartare & Iberian bbq pork. Could have order seconds on all but instead tried four desserts, all fab. Would we come again? \u00a0Not sure unless with a regular to get decent table. We had reserved but clearly counts for nought.",

I don't know but if I am not good enough to have a drink at the bar I am not going to buy fine wine and posh chow in the restaurantAll the best for the future",

Staff are a little inattentive at times but all friendly. The 'snacks' are a must with its famous crab doughnut, we also had the tuna devilled egg, corn bread with bacon and maple syrup butter. For mains we got a mixture but I went for my favourite octopus with daikon/shitake in soy broth. This was Devine with a twist of Japanese flavours. My friends ordered the iberico pork and duck with caramelised carrots and smoked short ribs all looked amazing! We didn't stop there either and indulged in the desserts from strawberry eaton mess, peach melba and rye with old fashioned syrup and vanilla ice cream. We were absolutely stuffed and the bill came to about \u00a370 per person but it was all so worth it!",

It's a great place for people watching!The three of us ordered the fish dishes, which were divine. We had a really great bottle of wine and the sashimi appetizer as well. The service was great -- our candle blew out halfway through the meal and instead of ignoring it they brought us a brand new one!

I'm told that the Firehouse is a rather upscale place where the big shots of London society (and occasionally celebrities) come to dine. The interior is beautiful, with an heir of classic French brasserie but with a contemporary London twist. Reservations are a must considering the hefty crowd during peak hours. The service was top notch from start to finish, and our server was very knowledgable on the menu and helped us on deciding what to order. We had the cornbread appetizer as well as a salad to start, both delicious. The short rib entree was wonderful and beautifully cooked. My favorite thing on the menu however was the black truffle polenta, very unique and sinful. Dessert consisted of some sort of cake with an ice cream that was also very good. I thoroughly enjoyed the Firehouse; everything from the food, to the service, to the ambience was just fabulous. Definitely one of the highlights of my trip to London.",

I have never had the Uber-popular avocado toast before, in any restaurant, and this was a delicious initiation. The eggs were perfectly poached and the avocado was complemented with fresh mint and dill. Divine. Also, I've never had a soy latte with as much foam. Wonderful.",

For starters, the Caesar salad is a must and the Beef Tartar unique (do I detect liver? Foie Gras?). The night we went, the oyster selection was Irish and both kinds were just sooooo good; I could eat dozens of these, but tonight was not an oyster night.For mains we had the Staffordshire beef fillet, Iberian pork and Tandoori Monkfish. See picture - each perfectly cooked.Had such a fun waiter, and all the staff were spunky and gracious. Just had a very good time; getting a resy here isn't the easiest, but worth it!",

    "text": "When dining at Chiltern Firehouse, make reservations in advance and tell them you'd like to sit by the chef's counter. It's quite the experience - watching the cooks prepare the food together like a well-oiled machine. From here, you get to witness everything from the meat grilling to the meticulous plating. I must also say that service here is on point. Anyone who has dined with me knows that I drink water like a race horse. Flagging down waiters for refills are thus usually a problem, but not at Chiltern.// Crab Stuffed Donuts (\u00a37) - 4 starsOne of Nuno Mendes' signature creations, this unique snack is what the restaurant is best known for. These slider-sized donuts are filled with crab and topped with coral dusting. A great balance of sweet and savory to start the meal off.// Firehouse Caesar (\u00a312) - 3 starsWhat separates this dish out from all the other Caesar salads is the crispy chicken skin they include. Flavor-wise, I didn't think it was anything special though.// Spiced Cornish Crab & Lobster Omelette (\u00a326) - 4 starsThis is not your typical scrambled omelette. As seen in the picture, the ingredients actually sit on top of the eggs rather than being mixed in. The coral mayo helped pull all the components together, with the shiso leaves adding in a nice touch.// Frozen Apple Panna Cotta (\u00a39) - 5 starsI debated for the longest time whether or not to order this dessert, but I'm sure glad I went for it. Such a beautifully plated finale. I especially enjoyed the herb granite, which was spectacular both visually and in taste.",

Even when we were on time, we were told to wait at the bar for the table. I ordered a Bloody Mary which was really good. I haven't had such a tasty Blood Mary in ages. Almost more than 30 minutes, when we asked whether the table was ready, we were told that it was ready but the waitress couldn't find us. Weird! We ordered few starters and oysters. The starters came on time and then we were served the mains. The Cornish crab omelette is a must try! When my friend enquired about the Oyesters, the waitress said that she had totally forgotten to serve it. So she will bring it after the mains. Again weird!The chef himself brought the Oyesters to the table and explained us about the Oyesters, which was very kind of him. They were pretty good.Overall a good experience with food. The service is not efficient.",

It is a pretty fancy place to dine and there is a dress code - No trainers or flip flops! Casual smart is fine. People who show up there can be quite dressy. If you are lucky, \u00a0you might run into a celebrity :) Unfortunately I've never had the chance to bump into any local movie stars during my visits. Bummer!!I had dinner on my first visit and it was on weekday with a group of 3pax. It was hard to get a booking, and you might want to do this in advance especially if it's near a festive season. We tried to increase our group size to 4pax at the very last minute over the phone but were politely rejected. So don't just show up with a +1 at the door, you might not even get your table. Upon arrival they ushered me to the table and took my coats and jackets. Immediately sat me down and made me comfy. Then proceeded to recommend me a cocktail which would pair well with our food. I enjoyed my first experience so much that I decided to make a second comeback with my partner for a Christmas brunch over the weekend. It took me about a good month in advance to book a slot, dinner slots were completely wiped out till 2017. I must say I was a little disappointed with their service the second time around. I did not receive the same hospitality as I did for dinner. The staff seem a little flustered that day, nothing was really offered nor recommended to us. It felt like that they were a little short handed. What a shame though, I was hoping to give my partner the same level of experience I had the first time but it wasn't up to that level. Nevertheless the food and drinks were still amazing. However it would be great if they maintain consistency with their services.",

The entrance is very confusing but normally they have workers to lead you to the restaurant from the entrance. The venue is also a hotel, so there are many hallways to walk down. The restaurant is bright and open and has a distinctive smoky smell. I was extremely excited to try their pancakes. THEY WERE DELICIOUS!!!! The pancakes are thick and fluffy and taste like thick American pancakes. The blueberries, blueberry compote, syrup, and yogurt topping all come on the side so you can add what you would like to. I highly recommend getting the pancakes. The pastries are also lovely. My mother got the croissants and loved them, but they are very large so next time, it might be better to get the selection of miniature pastries instead. The orders of toast are rather small so one order is only enough for one person, but it is sourdough toast and is amazing!They also have several delicious juices. The fresh pressed apple juice was amazing. \u00a0Additionally, they have drip coffee that is pretty good.",

I had made a reservation via email over a month in advance, and they could only accommodate us at 6pm or 10pm (gah), or at 8pm at chef's counter. I love counter seating, so this worked out perfectly.The decor was impeccably chic as expected, based on other Andre Balazs joints (Chateau Marmont, The Mercer). The food and service, however, were world class as well. The ever-changing menu really focused on seasonal ingredients, so we took advantage of that.We started with the asparagus, which was appropriately light despite the mountain of egg yolk shavings that adorned it. For a main, I went with the gnocchi, which was accompanied by a flawless presentation of taleggio, raisins, spring peas, and rounds of fennel. It was spring on a plate, and I am still thinking about it 2 weeks later.",

Great recommendations, very knowledgable about menu items. We started with cornbread made with bacon grease served with a chipotle butter. Also has two bottles of excellent New Zealand sauvegnon blanc. Our appetizers were grilled octopus, oysters and burrata cheese. Everything was amazing. The seasonings really come out in the flavor, unbelievable. For entrees, I had the monkfish, daughter had halibut and husband and other daughter had the pork. All dishes were works of art and simply incredible. Our desserts also were to die for. We shared a key lime pie, a chocolate fish and a mandarin sorbet. We got a tour of hotel and rooms after dinner which was lovely. Great bar and intimate feel, highly recommend this place!",

The disparity between the hype and the reality of the Chiltern firehouse was so extreme it needed calling out.This is a beautiful location and it's buzzing, but once inside it felt like you were part of a machine designed to get you in and out, and onto the next guest.Above all, it was the lack of consistency in terms of food and service that was astounding.Too fast to take orders & way too slow to deliver them. Food was brought to the table out of sequence. Insipid cocktails, staff with a lack of basic knowledge on the drinks / food offering. The signature dish, 'Pork Iberico', was tough & dry and, worst of all, the 'maple sweet potato' side dish was so sweet it was inedible.The whole operation appeared almost random, apparently lacking an authoritative maitre d' to ensure it flowed professionally.There were several highlights, including some of the food dishes (Carrot blunts, Short rib, Octopus), but way too few to warrant the price and the reputation, especially when London has so many other great restaurants.The one saving grace was our main server, who was excellent - \u00a0she was the only redemption for a venue that has built a reputation for being coolest eatery in town, yet completely lacked the attention to detail to deserve that accolade.",

It's aimed towards those who want to be seen spending money, not those interested in drinking a great wine.Our main waiter was very friendly. However, there seems to be overall poor communication between the staff. We would ask for a drink or bread and the message never seemed to be passed on - disappointing for a restaurant of this calibre. Having to re-ask for things multiple times is tiresome. The sommelier also left something to be desire as far as friendliness goes.The atmosphere and d\u00e9cor are lovely and comfortable. Modern European with an open kitchen.If you're prepared for the fact that it's over-hyped, you'll have a good dinner.",

The place is a scene to be seen and for those to see you. From the moment you arrive you are greeted by the outside bellman/bouncers? and looked up and down before you are delivered off to another chap who walks you thorough the maze to the hostess. Picture this, we went for breakfast on a Monday morning with four people and there was only a handful of tables occupied with about 25 staff people milling around trying to look busy. It was amazing the number of staff present for Monday morning breakfast.We place our order for breakfast, with only one request, that one of the egg dishes be cooked well done. (no running yokes) Simple enough for any breakfast cook.When the dish arrived, the yoke was still runny and we asked if we could get the order done as requested. The look and attitude that we received from the waitress was \" I told them to cook it the way you wanted\". It went back to the kitchen and was recooked.Then I took a bite of my french toast, it was totally raw inside, with the milk and egg oozing out. I asked another waitress if the chef could finish cooking the french toast and she brought the dish back to the kitchen.About 5 minutes later our waitress delivered us the following message from the Chef. \" I will be happy to cook you another french toast, but it will come out the same way as before\" OMG Any five year old can cook french toast! \u00a0I was ready to get up and go in the kitchen and show the chef how to make the simplest of breakfast foods.It just wasn't worth the effort. I guess the celebs like their food un cooked. This place is not worth the time nor the effort, especially when there is such a big disconnect between the kitchen, staff and guest.They obviously did not recognize who we were......but I hope for all you reading this, you don't support such an unwelcoming place that can't train its staff and kitchen about basic customer service, considering they have so many people on duty.",
