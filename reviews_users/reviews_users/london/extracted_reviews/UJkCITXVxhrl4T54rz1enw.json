    "text": "I decided to come to dinner here with my husband after looking at their menu. I just couldn't really believe that prices would be that good for a London sushi restaurant. When we entered, they asked if we had reservations, which we didn't, so we had to sit at the bar. It was fine for us... and it's understandable why. When we walked through the restaurant all the tables had \"Reserved\" signs on them! It was like walking through one of London's best kept sushi secrets!I was in desperate need for my sushi fix... so I ordered the charashi AND the sashimi, with a side of aigamo rosu (roasted duck). When our plates arrived, they were more than generous with the portions. They were a lot bigger than I thought they would be considering the prices! In our charashi there was more fish than rice! And plenty of sashimi to share between my husband and I. Though the duck wasn't impressive, it was still super tasty. Gotta love duck! To me it's the red meat of poultry. Does that even make sense? I'm giving Akari time to win me over, so I'll definitely keep them in mind whenever I start feeling a little sushi deprived.",

    "text": "All I can say here is - eh. Which is a bit of a disappointment. Akari is right in our neighbourhood so we were just waiting for the perfect date night to go try it out. \u00a0Both my partner and I are big sushi buffs with the great fortune of trying some of the best sushi restaurants from Tokyo, to San Francisco, to NYC so we were really excited to try Akari following both reviews here and from word of mouth. \u00a0We both approach sushi differently as well - where I am more of a purist - always preferring sashimi and noting the fish quality - my partner prefers to experiment with all the different roll combinations offered. \u00a0We were both pretty disappointed with our meal - the fish quality was so-so (and for this I admit we will have to go back and re-try and time of day and day of the week can definitely make a difference), the combinations at times watered down the flavours, and our recommended wine pairing for the meal did not seem to make sense when combined. \u00a0As I know other reviewers have raved about this place - we would be willing to try again but the price tag on our meal given our experience has made us hesitate so far. \u00a0I'll definitely repost if we have a better experience!",

    "text": "In the mood for Japanese, and refusing to eat at one of the chains on Upper Street, we ended up walking literally a mile, through torrential London downpour, on nothing but a vague recollection of a Japanese restaurant on Essex Road and a Google Maps beacon to lead us. That place turned out to be Akari and altogether a very pleasant experience. Thoroughly justifying to ourselves that we had deserved it for the trek, we set about ordering vast amounts of food - sushi and hot food - paired with Kirin to guzzle down. The hamachi nigiri was one of the best I had in London and my companion was just as happy with his eel nigiri. The rest of our nigiri set was just as delicious and so were the pork gyozas we had accompanying them. For our mains we both went for tonkatsu with boiled rice and were really impressed with how tender and flavoursome the pork was. I really enjoyed the fact it didn't feel like a Japanese restaurant, after all, it is a converted pub. But it only adds to the atmosphere of the place. The bill came to \u00a365 for two of us. A little on the pricy side but as I said that was for starters, sushi, mains and alcohol so your mileage may vary. A great find I'll definitely be returning to.",

If you have ever been to an Izakaya, and it is quite likely that you have not, this is the English version. Simple decor and well priced, tasty food is a winning combination, not 100% authentic, but not too far off. The waiting staff seemed very impressed by my Japanese, though this is hardly surprising, given that they probably don't hear it too much in Islington. They made all of the right noises, and I felt like I had been transported back to my year abroad. The only bad thing about this place is the distance from the tube, this was made more annoying by the torrent of rain that decided to pour down on us just as we left the station, but by the time we arrived, we had certainly worked up an appetite. Definitely one to try out.",

There were some really great specials when I was there and you can get some off-beat fish types too. I'd put this place up there in my top 2 sushi places for London",

It was a really pleasant surprise to find Japanese food of this standard in the neighborhood.I love the Akari hand roll, the sashimi is fresh though a bit pricey, and they also do a wonderful salt-grilled salmon belly.

The menu comprises of excellent sushi and sashimi, pan fried, grilled and deep fried meals, rice, noodles along with a specials menu. The \"Tuna Tataki\" special is mouth wateringly delicious and highly recommendable! The food is fresh, the prices are reasonable and the premises very cosy.

    "text": "We had the seaweed salad which we thought was very nice, followed by chirashi which was presented nicely, but we felt the portion was extremely small compared to other Japanese restaurants we have visited in the past. In addition, we ordered a tuna special from the menu. Unfortunately, it was a little overcooked and some parts of the dish was very salty. We wouldn't recommend it. We finished off our meal with the pudding and cheesecake. Neither was really worth mentioning or worth reordering in the future. Overall, the salad and chirashi was nice, although a little small, the other dishes were not worth the money. Food aside, I felt the service we received was below par. We asked the waitress for recommendations and she could not give us a straight answer. All she said was, everything is nice. I asked her for a description of the desserts and she she the pudding was traditional. I asked her for more details, she said wobbly I had to ignore everything she said and made up my own mind. We noticed the staff were very clumsy and did not seem to know what they were doing. The waitress spilt the soya sauce, she poured tea outside the cup over the table, she nearly dropped the dessert, she gave us two plates of soya sauce each and did not give us any wasabi to go with the chirashi and to top things off, she bought the base plate for the dessert after she put our desert downtotal chaos. When we went to pay the bill, we asked for the bill to be split in half. After we paid, I noticed that she had overcharged us by rounding the bill up \u00a0this isn't what we asked her to do. We called her over and explained that we were not happy that this act had taken place as it was dishonest, esp as they had already taken 10% service charge. She said she did not understand why we were unhappy. She said the bill was hard to split in half (it wasn't, she only had to halve it), she also said that they always did that to all their customers, but we were the first people to complainshe then proceeded to rant at us and said it wasn't a lot of money (it was 98p), we said that wasn't the point and we weren't after a refund, we just wanted to point out that it was a bad way to do business esp when they had already charged service charge. She then very rudely said to us we could have our pound back. But we didn't take it as just wanted to get out of there as she was starting to get hostile. It's fair to say that we will not be returning and if you have any common sense, I wouldn't bother going there either. There are much better Japanese restaurants around London and this is def one to add on to my black list. Unprofessional staff and average to low quality food. Absolute disappointment.",

I love the charm that stems from the fact that this is a converted pub, the rustic big wooden tables, the mirrors on the wall, the bar, the big windows and the soft light. The service is just perfect; I always feel soothed and comfortable immediately upon entering. The food is amazing as well - I recommend ordering many different dishes and sharing them with a group of friends. I cannot really judge whether this food is authentic, but I know that it tastes great to my humble palate, and the Asians who are eating here seem to be enjoying it, too. And if you don't manage to get a table, you can sit at the bar in the back and watch the Sushi chefs prepare their food directly in front of your nose. All of this comes with a very reasonable price tag. Highly recommended - and don't forget to book if you don't want to be disappointed!",

When it first opened they had a huge menu (both food and whiskey) but they recently reduced it in size and introduced a A4 sheet of specials which is probably a good idea. None of the dishes are big so the best way to eat is to order a bunch a things of the menu and share. I've had so many good new food experiences here, highly recommended if you like raw fish or just trying something a bit different. The decor inside is also cool - it's got an old woodeny pub feel to it, which is probably because it used to be a pub. The kitchen is on one side of the room where the bar used to be. They also do a fantastic green tea ice-cream which is not to be missed.",

The tuna was a lovely shade of pink, but not the electric colour of tuna that's been filled up with preservatives to keep longer. Quite reasonably priced, as well.I had a pork dish with ginger sauce that was nice, but not amazing. I've definitely had better. I also had a lovely glass of white wine. Their house wines were a bit nicer than most. We ended our meal with ice cream- he had the matcha flavour and I had the black sesame. They were both gorgeous. The matcha was the beautiful deep green you get when there's a lot of tea powder present, and the brown sugar syrup complemented the bright grassy flavour really well. The black sesame ice cream was a lovely, if unexpected, flavour. Nutty and savoury with the brown sugar syrup giving it just a touch of sweetness. It was quite rich, and I think it would be perfect for someone who likes a less sweet dessert.Overall, if you're a sushi lover, you'll love Akari. Jury's still out on the other dishes. I'm going to try a few more before I cast final judgement on it. The service was very inconsistent, as well. We had three waitresses over the course of our meal, and only one of them was any good. The other two were hurried, impatient, and edging on rude. They were also really slow, taking ages to clear our dishes and bring our desserts and bill. I will definitely give them another try, but mostly because there aren't many other options for good Japanese food in London.",

Gyoza was serviceable but the crunchy deep fried approach here did not add any plus points. The two plates of tempura which we had to order afterwards due to everyone still being hungry was also pretty standard.3.5 stars for the overall food and experience but while it was good you end up ordering more dishes than you intended as the portions are quite small so it's neither a cheap and cheerful Japanese nor a high end gastronomic experience.",

    "text": "This review is for the food only as I ordered for take-away. The restaurant, however, was buzzing and looks more like an English pub than a traditional Japanese sushi bar. Will need to dine-in next time.The sushi was great. Really enjoyed my salmon skin and tuna roll. Fish was fresh and well prepared. \u00a0My pan fried beef (in a miso-like sauce) was also great, and cooked to perfection. The gyoza disappointed a bit---they were completely deep-fried. I would prefer them to have been steamed/pan-fred as they are in most other sushi restaurants.Location is off the beaten track, probably about a 5-8 minute walk up Essex road away from islington Green, and a 15 minute walk from Angel Station.",

The decor is a cross between Japanese and pub/bar (the original use of the space - interesting tiling and mirrors on the wall; nice high ceilings). The service is efficient and friendly. With beer, entries, main course and desert for two people at about 30 Pounds excellent value. I disagree with LauraN who doesn't recommend the warm options: I love the miso aubergine, and Kitsune Soba noodles are perfect on cold evenings. One warning: the bar lighting is pretty harsh; the table seating much better. As this place gets busy it's worth booking ahead of time to avoid disappointment.Many vegetarian/vegan options (the plum maki is excellent; the natto an acquired taste). There are even a few vegan desserts.",

    "text": "Went here last night in a group of five. Had an overall very positive experience. As others have noted, Akari is located in a former pub, which gives it a homey, down-to-earth vibe, nothing like the more sterile Japanese places I often see.For appetizers we shared some tofu and edamame; both were great. For the main entree I got salmon teriaki, which was delicious. Moist, tender, perfectly glazed - delicious. My companions got stuff like sushi and what have you. I tried some of their food and it was good as well. Akari has a good drinks menu, with a few standard Asian pale lagers, several sake varieties, hard alcohol and wine. I had some of the house sake, Oni Koroshi, which is a fairly mild though still flavorful; I would recommend it to anyone who wants to try a sake for the first time.People say the prices here are good and these people seem to be pretty right. I'm no expert on sushi pricing (the stuff my friends got) but the salmon was a good deal at \u00a38.90, I thought. As was the house sake, at \u00a33.90 for 300ml or so. The total bill for five people came to about \u00a3140, which included a roughly \u00a310 service charge. In all we got five pints of pale lager, three servings of sake, two appetizers seven or eight main dishes. The service throughout our visit was efficient and friendly. No complaints on this place, really. Tempted to give it five stars. But if I need an excuse to give it four, then fine, here goes: they could have a better Japanese beer selection. I know there are great Japanese beers to be had (Ise Kadoya, Hitachino, Baird...) and this place should have them. Overall, though, this restaurant is a keeper.",

Eating fresh fat chunks of fish, dressed in delicately seasoned Japanese flavours, served with fluffy rice, perfectly cooked. And all of this is done in the comfort of a good old English pub!Nope this place isn't a pub anymore but it is a Japanese restaurant that has fantastic traditional pub surroundings. It's quite an experience and actually this was some tasty inner city sushi. Laura N is right about the hot food, slightly baffling how they just can't get that right but hey, we can't all be perfect. Now finally, let me give you a warning, if you get squished onto a table with some obnoxious tourists (quite rare for this area too!) them make sure you don't bad-mouth them as you walk out the pub, they'll most likely be there having a fag. Shame... shame on me!",

It's a great space with a good vibe and the food's of a really high standard. The yellowtail carpaccio, teriyaki salmon and the gyoza were all great. As noted the gyoza are deep fried rather than the traditional steamed/fried method. No harm done though as they were still on point.The only thing that was a let down was the pork katsu - the coating lacked the crunch that makes it a great dish.The surprise biggest win of the night was the tanuki udon. The broth was pretty much perfect and stands up to a lot versions I've had in Japan.Price-wise it's not too bad but not really cheap enough to become a go-to regular. If the drinks were a little cheaper this place would be unbeatable. The vegetarian options are a bit limited, so keep that in mind if that's an issue. Overall though, Akari is putting out some good renditions of Japanese standards.",

They have a large selection of sake and the decor of the restaurant is really cozy. The staff is a little slow though. I'm a big fan of sushi and whenever the opportunity arises I always order the soft shell crab roll. This place however was a disappointment as it was very bland. I suggest asking the staff what they recommend rather than just choosing a bunch of different plates! I'll be honest that I have never returned but if you are craving sushi at fairly low prices and a nice atmosphere it's a nice place for it!",

    "text": "BEST Japanese I've had in London. Honestly, I've been in this fair city a year and have had nothing but rubbish ramen and crappy chain sushi. When I list the things I miss about home (Auckland), it't it a bit odd to say I miss all the fantastic Japanese joints the most? LDN is meant to be on top of its game when it comes to food, but so far no dice.Until last night, when the boy and I decided to wrap up and head to that funny looking pub with a Japanese sign just up the road from our place. Hello Akari!It was busy, but we booked half an hour before (thanks Yelpers for the tip!) and were whisked straight to our seats. Right next to some presumably famous football player - because people kept walking up to this chap and thanking him for being a living legend. Um okay. I totally digress... But we were very happy because the ex-pub is beautiful! And tastefully decorated! The kitchen is smack in the middle, where the bar would have been, so you can have a nosey and watch the head chef rattle off orders.I had: nasu dengaku - or sweet miso covered aubergine - which was so so good. In fact I LIED about how amazing it was so I could scoff it all without sharing. The kitsune soba was yummy and felt very healthy. I also had read amazing things about the sushi so partook in a cucumber and avocado roll which was totally banging. Can I say that about sushi? Yes, yes I can. (By the way, these were all vegetarian options if you, like myself are that way inclined).Boy had: miso pork katsu, sui gyoza (pork dumplings in soup) and some tasty pickled vegetables. He reported that all were excellent.We didn't stick around for dessert but we were pretty full! Total for 2, plus 3 pint of Asahi, including service was just under 50 pounds. Well worth it - save up your lunch money (eschewing Yo Sushi et al) and go!",

    "text": "This place is great. Great fresh sushi and sashimi for a reasonable price, udon noodles, traditional Japanese chicken & beef dishes. We've been 3 times and mostly just binge on sushi and sashimi platters, but definitely try some other dishes as well. They serve Ashai on draft (so much better and colder than on bottle) and have a few sakes as well.In my experience, the service is nothing to complain about and always has been great.Another great thing about this place is the venue. Hosted in an old pub, they barely changed the setting and so it's something different compared to most Asian restaurants.If you crave sushi and don't want to spend a fortune in London; this is definitely the place to go!",

    "text": "We walked into Akari on Friday night hoping to grab a table for two and was delighted Akari could accommodate us (we were starrrving)! The tables are all really big and you will have lots of space between you and the other customers if you dine here. I got sushi which was fresh and tasty and my boyfriend got gingered beef which was also really good. We had goyza to share (would have preferred if this wasn't deep fried but still nice), glass of wine and a sake. The waiters left us alone except to fill up our water and bring extras ginger which we really liked as we didn't feel rushed.Overall an enjoyable meal, I'm not raving about it but I'll definitely be back! Solid performance Akari!!",

    "text": "When you first enter, Akari appears to be a traditional English pub rather than a japenese restaurant. I ordered the gyoza (dumplings) for starter, which I absolutely loved. Very tasty, lovely and crisp on the bottom, and deliciously soft on the top. I then had the chicken katsu for a main dish - the deep fried chicken was beautifully succulent inside, with a lovely crisp coating. The sauce and tanginess of the mustard were great.The food here was very good, and also reasonably priced. I didn't try any of the suchi, but my boyfriend did and seemed impressed. I would definitely recommend Akari.",

    "text": "I'd heard that the sushi here was great . I am a stickler for quality when it comes to raw fish, so I've passed on a few establishments in London, after taking a look at the fish, or after reading lackluster reviews. \u00a0But we gave this restaurant (in a converted pub) a try, and I was very pleasantly surprised. \u00a0The sushi was top notch, some of the tastiest, freshest fish I've had in London. \u00a0I was quite hungry that night, so I decided to ensure I'd get enough to eat by ordering a tempura vegetable starter.When our orders arrived, the fried food (including my vegetable tempura, which inexplicably included shrimp), had *way* too much batter on it. \u00a0I even took the batter off one of the pieces of sweet potato, and examined just how thick the coating was. \u00a0Let's just say it wasn't the lightest of tempura coating I've had. \u00a0To let you know how overbattered it was, I almost got full from that starter, so I stopped eating it.Back to the sushi. \u00a0It was all very good, very fresh, and the sashimi was outstanding - I had a hamachi (yellowtail) carpaccio, which was sublime.So one star deduction for the fried food, but still highly recommended.",

Was very disappointed with it all! Tasted like airport Japanese food. The sushi rice was super cold, the salmon teriyaki was such a small portion and very \"meh\" flavour. Gyoza totally forgettable. Will try again and eat in as so many people have said how good it is.",
