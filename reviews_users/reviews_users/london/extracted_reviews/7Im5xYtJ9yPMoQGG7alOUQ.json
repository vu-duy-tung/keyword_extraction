I have a big appetite (as all my friend know!) and even I was full after the first two courses (a beautiful velvety and rich mushroom soup and beautifully cooked steak with side of fries.) The restaurant itself is very attractive. The room is gorgeous with high ceilings (so feels particularly light and airy) and funky furniture. Sadly we weren't lucky enough to see any celebs during our dining experience but apparently it is a frequent celeb hangout and I don't blame them. Service was pretty good although strangely they were quite slow with pouring our wine. Wine was hidden away behind our booth in an ice bucket so we never knew how much was left. Great venue.",

The restaurant delivers the upmarket Modern British food so beloved of Conran, and is of the highest quality (and price). Dishes include Cornish Crab, Lobster, Lamb & Steak. You can eat quite reasonably here, as long as you stick to the cheaper end of the wine list! The dining space is a wonderful 1st floor contemporary space, with views into the kitchen on one side and out onto the Kings Road on the other. For special occaisions hire out the private room, which always reminds me of a James Bond villain control room in the way it overlooks the main restaurant. The Private members club also has rooms for hire. The cafe spills out onto the forecourt in front of the garage and has a very European/pavement cafe feel. The foodmarket serves up some great ingredients too.",

No. In fact, it took literally 5-7 minutes before someone came over and swept up the broken glass. How's that for fine dining? The second time was my birthday and I was solo. I had pork and it was just ok. The bar is uncomfortable and the people working there seem to be going through the motions. I haven't been since the D+D folks took over but I'm not expecting much better. There are better dining locations in London, this isn't one of them.",

I realize that it may not be the best food in town, but it is a place I'd recommend going at least once if you're ever in the area. I'm giving it four stars for the ambience alone. Some friends and I went here for a late night dinner one night after hearing how posh it was. We just wanted to see what it was all about. \u00a0I was not at all disappointed by the atmosphere. Seemed upscale, very young and good-looking crowd. People were dressed nicely. The waiters and hostesses were also dressed nicely and wearing matching outfits, but not in a cheesy way. The dining area is very beautiful and has a nice, contemporary feel. \u00a0It did take quite a while for us to be seated for our reservation, so that was one negative thing. They sat us down at the bar to wait. It wasn't terrible, but faster seating could have enhanced the experience. \u00a0In terms of the food, it was nothing to rave about. I honestly can't even remember what I ordered, other than a vegetable side dish. I do remember being satisfied by the meal, so I wouldn't say it was disappointing.

One thing slightly annoyed me: when I asked the waiter's opinion of a couple of the dishes on the menu in the cheaper, \u00a315 range, he tried to up-sell me by advising me to go for a \u00a325 option. As a former waitress, I know up-selling is tempting, but it creates an embarrassing situation for the guest! We had fun: we all enjoyed our meals, but it wasn't really for me. If this sounds like your kind of place, you'll probably love it. If, like me, you're more into street food and local joints with amazing food and a friendly atmosphere, then this is one to avoid. In fact, probably best to avoid Chelsea altogether...",

The food is good quality, the atmosphere is superb and the service is great. No complaints so far. The bill was a little on the steep side for what we had but no more than you would pay in other high end restaurants.What nobody told me about and What i like the most about this place is that it has one of the most superb selection of Vodkas and Gin's I've come across. If you like these spirits you are in for a treat, (i recommend the Hamersmith local Gin!) the staff are well versed in what goes with what and the history of the different brands. They also have a few good looking private function rooms which look great.I'd have given this 3 stars but the excellent bar and atmosphere brings it up to 4.

It did feel a little condescending, but maybe I was being sensitive?Ordering out the way, we managed to have ourselves a really fun night in here. It was busy and bustling. The food was decent. I've had muuuuuch better smoked salmon from Sainsbury's, the venison was tasty but small and the dessert I opted for; super-rich.All in all, a pleasant evening and experience. But, as we remarked to each other upon leaving, I would feel disappointed to pay through the nose for the food we had. There is much tastier and better value dining experiences to be had elsewhere.",

The decor is stunning in this large bar and restaurant, reminiscent of the inside of a beautiful ship.The cocktails were fruity, icy and alcoholic = me likeyHowever they were unnecessarily expensive = me no likeyThe staff were friendly and the area that was reserved for our private party was quite large. My only complaint was that it was also right next to the entrance so there was a lot of other people in the area, not so private.I would love to come back and try the food but judging by other reviews I would do so at my own risk. \u00a0When I was there the restaurant was packed and the food looked beautifully presented, so I might still give it a go.",

The staffs need to be more organised on these special occasions also the waiters do try and up-sell. Really sad as it spoilt what would have been a lovely afternoon out. I would recommend it as its really nice place & quality is very good. I think though when it gets busy on these special dates, its one to avoid if your limited for time.",

I'd encourage a cocktail or glass of champagne in the bar, just don't bother eating. Similarly the cafe downstairs is woth having a drink in. A couple of beers in the sun is a ood idea.Don't bother with this place. It's poor VFM and not that nice. There are much better and cheaper restaurants in the area (Cadogan Arms and Pig Ear are two to name).",

    "text": "My friend & I originally planned just to catch up in a nice venue which was local to us. I sometimes venture down the Kings Road to browse in my nearest Cath Kidston store, and the Bluebird cafe/restaurant/bar is just a short stroll before this. My friend had been here before and recommended the Bluebird, and I do enjoy trying new places which are local. You first walk through the forecourt which has a number of tables, which is their cafe section - here you can have breakfast & lunch during the day and then dinner & drinks in the evening. I noticed that everyone looked particularly smart, both the men & women. As we met after work and it was getting a little chilly, we decided to head up to the first floor. Immediately you are taken by the chic interior design with lots of reds, we sat around the bar, and as I don't drink they made me an amazing non-alcoholic cocktail. Neither of us had eaten, but we hadn't booked a table, we were however lucky enough to get a table as it was early on in the week. Whilst my friend was eating oysters and seabass, I was particularly unsophisticated and ordered a hamburger which came with chips - simple but tasty :-) I have to say the two people that served us were soo nice, attentive when needed but also left us to it. Dress code: everyone looked smart, which is what you'd expect for somewhere on the fashionable Kings Road. I did however dress smart/casual, teaming my high-waisted skinny jeans with a blouse and pretty bow heels. If you want an alternative place to meet with friends but which is more sophisticated than the local pub, then I'd suggest this. Also, it would make a lovely venue for first dates or couples. I'd definitely go here again.",

It's a big open place, a little bit brasserie in style with lots of Conran design points in the lighting, tables and stylistics choices.The food is British mostly, with pies, roasts and game featuring fairly prominently on the menu. I had the chicken and mushroom pie when I was in - I think it was about \u00a310 which is quite a bit but I was quite impressed with the quality, the pastry and the accompaniments were spot on. The price goes up a lot when you add more meat and effort to the plate and the roast is just under \u00a320. It's all pricey but say on a Sunday lunch it's cool.",

Brunch is certainly my favourite time to come anyway. A very cool outdoor area with decent service but a great location being in central Chelsea. It is a very fashionable place to eat so I would definitely suggest making the trip there with a small group just to check it out. They make a very good Bloody Mary.",

Now, a shell of its former self it's a train wreck. I got the pleasure of waiting 15 minutes for the person to show up to seat me in a wide open patio. Then, once seated, we waited 20 minutes to ever get a waiter to attend to us (of course I had to walk across the patio and nearly slide tackle him). Once we ordered a bottle of champaign and meats, we were promised a bucket of ice for the champaign (which I am still waiting for and not very hopeful now that we are 30 minutes into that empty promise). The low point probably came when the waitress with her blank stare seemed severely challenged with taking our water order. Apparently asking for bottled still water was severely beyond her capabilities. My suggestion, shop in their market and keep walking down the road....better meals lay ahead.",

The high ceilings, eclectic furniture, and lavish flower arrangements were a sight to behold. We were seated promptly when we requested and ordered from the set menu. Everything was perfectly prepared, artfully served, and scrumptious. The food was fresh and seasonal, but not memorable. However, the service, and atmosphere was beyond comparison.

I figured this had to be good and planned to meet a few friends here for dinner. I quickly realized this place is all glitz without much substance behind it.The ambiance is wonderful - we were led to a huge dimly-lit room full of a lot of beautiful people celebrating birthdays, out for a nice dinner, etc. The menu looked appealing enough. While pricey, they had a wide range of selections that were enticing. While I like to get value in my dining experiences, I am always willing to pay a bit more for a great meal, so the price was not necessarily a negative for me. At my group of 4, each and every single one of us were underwhelmed with our meal at every stage (starter, main, and dessert). The food wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great or even good either. Coupled with the hefty price tag that came along with the meal, it just wasn't really worth it. Even in an expensive city like London, I could have gotten a meal that was tenfold more enjoyable for the price I paid at Bluebird. Additionally, the service was slow an unattentive, which is interesting because we didn't sit down to dinner until 9:30, so the restaurant was slowing down. I found myself frustrated at the lags in getting our wine glasses refilled, the delay in the bill presentation, etc. If you're looking for a great meal, I'd say walk past. If you're looking for a trendy scene for some drinks at the bar, this might be okay. Just be warned you will be paying a lot more for what you're getting out of it.",

We had a total three waiters attending to us, but to very little avail. We completely threw them by asking one of them to wipe our table (covered in crumbs) which resulted in our water order to be taken back to the bar and not be brought back for ages.An embarrassment as I was entertaining a business guest from Germany!

Cocktails are always well executed and service level in the restaurant is always quite high.

It did great things for my mind and mouth.. Everyone is professional and the venue is relaxing .... Go go go it's so worth it *flicks hair like models do in l'oreal adverts*",

I'd recommend this place for drinks with friends....it's not cheap but they're worth it",

You know, the type of Chelsean's who go to spend a lot of money and look good and judge everyone else? It's kind of funny because I feel like I'm starting to write a lot of judgy reviews, but it is my choice to come to these places. WHATEVER I'm getting distracted. I think I'm going through a cocktail phase where I think it's really fun to just try a bunch of cocktails. To be honest with you, all of the cocktails I tried (which was 8 because we are only friends with people who like to share ;) ) were absolutely delicious. And that's saying something!!! They were all really different and beautiful. I especially dug the lychee and rose martini. So, if you're into cocktails, and don't mind spending some dough (no they're not cheap, you're in Chelsea so you can't complain about the price), then come here!Not gonna lie, I'd love to check out this place during the day because everyone talks about sitting outside on their pretty patio.",

Seating outside includes couches, tables, or at the bar. Various flowers and greenery help give the place a garden party vibe. The menu for the cafe area is simple, but allows you to enjoy a lighter meal as well as a glass (or two) of beer or wine. For my meal, I chose the Croque Monsieur, a sandwich with ham and adorned with melted emmental cheese on top, paired with a salad and fries. The sandwhich was so good, especially after a morning of sightseeing that built up an appetite. Paired with a glass of one of their red wines, this was a perfect place to unwind and relax.",

Getting there half an hour early meant we had time for a drink at the bar. Great atmosphere, very dim lighting throughout and stylish interior. Ordered two very well made cocktails. Our table was first set right next to the till (and all the coming and going wait staff). We asked to move which involved setting up another table which was done quickly and without issue. The food: scallops, yellowfin tuna tartare and steak for two. The starters were delicious, mainly the scallop dish but the tuna was perfectly nice. Steak was stunning, we devoured it. The bottle of wine we ordered was outstanding and would go back just to have a glass. Would recommend for a trendy, delicious dinner option.",

This ended up being our least favorite meal of the entire trip and I would not recommend the restaurant.We arrived for our 6:00 PM reservation and was told the table was not ready! Crazy as the place was pretty much empty except for patrons at the bar. So, we ordered up a couple of glasses of champagne while we waited.The restaurant is fairly large with an open plan and the decor was somewhat odd. The waitstaff and wine steward were friendly and knowledgeable, but we felt that the service was rushed.We started with the Buratta, which was divine, and the 24 months prosciutto, which had a delicious packed quince sauce. My Mom had the handmade gnocchi and loved them, while my Dad ventured out and ordered the Grilled calf's liver, which he said was divine. I went out on a limb and ordered the mackerel, a fish I'd never eaten before. It was salty and flavorful.Overall, I'd give the food high marks but wouldn't go back due to poor service and atmosphere. I think it would be a better place to go for drinks and appetizers when the weather is warm and you can sit outside.",

Quick disclaimer - my cousin and her hubs both loved this place as it was the site of one of their first date location, but were slightly disappointed in our experience.The food was delish. I ordered the salmon and started with the heirloom tomato salad. The burata in the salad was some of the best I've had! The salmon was good - very tender but the sauce with it was a little bitter for my taste. The boys split the steak and allowed me to steal a bite. It was so tender and melted in my mouth. I wish I would have ordered it!The service was only so-so. The servers seemed irritated when we asked for more water and ketchup - super silly things I know. The room was also extremely hot. We requested that they turn up the AC and they seemed bothered with this as well. I assumed that as a nice, relatively expensive restaurant, asking for this shouldn't be a huge deal.Despite this though, I'm sure my cousin will go back. It might not be my first choice if/when I'm back in London.",

The art deco, white building set back against the King's Road of Chelsea is a beautiful dining experience. It's definitely where you would take your fiance's parents or a long courted girlfriend. It makes for a 'dress-up' fancy brunch out with the girls to eat up not only the the Anglo-French menu but the airy, splendidly grand structure of the interior.Menu items are typical of brunch, with eggs served up in fancy ways and the lunch menu appeared to be fairly standard as well. What you wouldn't expect is all the little extras of the cafe, such as wine cellar boasting 750 bottles of vino and the adorable shop where you can buy your favorites to take home with you. The cocktail list here is actually impressively long - perfect for a boozy afternoon. There is an outdoor courtyard and the afternoon tea area as well.Amid stunning presentation of the food, the thing that didn't make me fall instantly in love with it, is that the food seemed to be missing some of the finesse I would expect of an established brunch haven of Bluebird's fame. The side salads were not quite there, small and with the dressing being thin and meek. The eggs royale were fine, of course, but nothing to take them over the edge of everyday eggs royale anywhere. I had similar comments from the other guests are our table in regards to the salmon as well. I will definitely be returning, but perhaps for cocktails or afternoon tea (or both).",

All the staff were so friendly, sweet and attentive, I felt happy and relaxed the whole evening. We got a fantastic deal of 2 courses with a glass of wine for \u00a320 from the set menu. The food really surprised me it was excellent! I had a pea risotto which was a huge portion and really cheesy and tasty!

I am sure it makes for a beautiful summer evening out. I will go back here just for the prawns with chili miso glaze....magic...pure magic. For mains I had the southern fried chicken and the husband had mussels. Both were really good! I couldn't finish my chicken though. There was some good red wine to go with it. I know white would be a better pairing with our food choice..but it was a cold evening...and we both prefer red.Staff is nice, service is quick. Ambiance as I said is good.

    "text": "I echo other reviewers' comments in the quality of the food. We had three dishes and all three were bland and nothing that I would pay Bluebird prices for. Service, however, was attentive and the atmosphere was nice. Game terrine - bland. Toast was hard as a rock. Pan roasted plaice - felt like it was more bones than meat on the fish. Spinach was soaked in oil. Flourless chocolate cake - inconsistent as parts were dry and others were moist.",

    "text": "Reading the reviews, I'm not surprised that this place only has 3 stars. I booked for a Sunday lunch with friends, which puts you in the upstairs restaurant that was nearly deserted. The downstairs front garden area is the place to be and attracts a queue, but I don't think you can book for that. On the other hand, I think Bluebird is one of the better known places on King's Road, and the decor is very upscale and classy. So the type of brunch you would put on makeup and a nice dress for, not like shorts and flip flops.When we got to the table, a few of our friends were running late so we tried to order mimosas... the waitress didn't know what a mimosa was, but she suggested the cocktail menu, and before we knew it, we had a long list of champagne cocktails to choose from. I got the Flirtini and it was delicious, and my friend got the Tiffany Rose and said that was great too. They're not cheap and will cost you more than your meal, but champagne is always fun for brunch.For my main, I got the burger because I had seen it on the blackboard outside the restaurant, and I was very disappointed. There was nothing special about it, and I even felt that it was underseasoned, as the meat had no flavor. I got the polenta chips as a side instead of normal chips, and those were oversalted but at least unique. They also messed up my friends' eggs benedict and eggs royale orders, as they asked for the sauce on the side and when it came with sauce poured all over it, we had to send it back. Luckily the replacement came within 5 minutes.Overall I'd say the food was a letdown, but the decor and the drinks make this place worth going. And next time I'd love to try the garden area and stick around to peek around the shop and the bakery. The whole place is beautiful, just wish the kitchen could keep up!",
