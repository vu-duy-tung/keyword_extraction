Most of the time it was just for coffee (they make capucinno's like the Italians do) but i've also had breakfast and lunch here. The food is pretty good, although not fantastic. The staff are usually pretty friendly and there's quite a nice relaxed ambience to the place. If you're passing and you fancy a coffee, give it a blast. Also for a nice lunch or realxed dinner I'd recommend this place.",

Name aside, this is a perfect place to clean away the cobwebs of a Saturday night.This little cafe is charming, quirky and informal and when my friend and I came in for breakfast, we found it full of locals. So full that it was quite hard to get a table for our breakfast, but at least I knew that it had a good reputation.The menu is Modern European. This means plenty of fish, and plenty of sharing plates. We were here for brunch, so I ordered the Smoked Salmon and Scrambled Eggs. They were the creamiest eggs that I have had in a long time, and the portion was so big that I couldn't finish it.My friend had the French Toast. While mine was a savoury pick up, I couldn't resist tearing at his sweet dish. I thought mine tasted the best, but his was almost as good.I was jealous for everyone in West Hampsted having this little gem on their doorstep; it obviously is one of the locals in the know choices.",

    "text": "I've just moved into the neighbourhood and was quite excited about discovering a new brunch spot on the weekend with a friend. We settled on Wet Fish Cafe out of the various options on West End Lane because of its super-cool website, quirky interior and all-round rave reviews. We didn't however think we were signing up for a kindergarten nostalgia session, which is what we experienced at the hands of our Waitress Not Having a Good Day who took it upon herself to reform us errant children. So we asked for the specials of the day and WNHGD tells us they're on the board outside which left us a bit dumb-founded as we're inside. Helpfully, she clarified at the end of the meal when we asked her what that was about that she expected us to get up and go read the specials on the board outside! Anyway, that was followed by her interrupting our sentences before we could finish them and then telling us off for trying to change something on an order (friend didn't want the pancetta) \"I already told you you couldn't do that....\". \u00a0Real shame as the food was quite delicious (totally second the other recommendation on the potato scramble with re-fried beans, genius!), the other waitress serving the floor perfectly nice and helpful (she brought in the specials board for her tables) and the general ambience friendly and welcoming. To be fair, I called the owner the next day and he apologised profusely and I believe genuinely for our treatment at the hands of his staff and did not make any excuses for WNHGD's behaviour. But I would have liked an apology from her herself when I had raised the appalling service issues with her at the end of the meal rather than a dismissive shrug of the shoulders and a \"there you go\". Hoping it's a one-off and the owner did his best to reassure me that that's what it was but too scarred to give it another go just yet.",

The food has a touch of the fancy about it, and a whole lot of taste. The French toast is great, as is the scrambled eggs with chorizo and refried beans, and the bacon on polenta. There's a full menu for other mealtimes too, so if you're after more than breakfast with coffee you've got plenty of choice. There are usually a few newspapers around, too.",

Overall it was a very good experience in a cute, romantic and intimate space with good food elevated by amazing service. They use the limited space very well and never felt cramped in there. There's also plenty to look at on the walls with (what I think) was art available to purchase. Due to the entertainment and layout I wasn't able to check it all out but what I saw looked interesting, particularly the neon river above the bar. The set menu for the evening was tremendous value at \u00a329.50. I ordered the scallops and salmon whilst my partner had the cod terrine and lamb. All the dishes were solid options, good portion size and well presented. We also had a couple of cocktails and I enjoyed the Negroni. What would make me return to this place was the service. From the warm welcome to the sincere thank you as we left everything was exceptional. Service was prompt and they handled the quietness of the room when Natalie was performing with the respect it deserved. They were happy to recommend dishes, were attentive and friendly throughout. Overall I would recommend the entertainment nights wholeheartedly and will be back in the future.",

    "text": "Brunch heaven, this place is.Visited with three other friends at 10 am on a rainy Saturday morning, and each of us got something different. The original plan was to share, but I think everyone enjoyed their own plates so much that no actual sharing took place. All the dishes looked very good, and the smoothies are a must try.I got the potato, chorizo, and eggs scramble - and though it didn't look like a healthy portion when the food came out, it was very filling and very good - just the right amount. I would highly recommended it.Another thing I would recommend is to come early (as close to open as possible). When we got there, the place had maybe 3-4 tables full. By 10:45 am, there were was a queue of people and baby strollers. I can see why this place would get busy - great food at good prices in a relaxed atmosphere.Will definitely be back - maybe I'll see you if you come in at the open on Saturdays.",

You get great food by people who love food. The atmosphere is nice and you isnatntly see and feel that this place isn't a generic business but a restaurant run by real people with a love for what they do.Anthing that you eat in here deserves a 5star rating. Truly one of the best places in West Hampstead.",

Got the breakfast salad and it was tasty, well cooked eggs and flavourful dressing, but it wasn't quite what I expected based on the menu description, which my friends also found with their meals. Overall decent food and friendly service, but overpriced compared to other options around.",

    "text": "We visited the Wet Fish Caf\u00e9 for Saturday brunch. The table ordered the following:* potato, chorizo and egg scramble - The chorizo had \u00a0a \u00a0great, spicy flavour that infused the eggs. The eggs themselves were expertly cooked, meaning that it hit the balance of being fully cooked without being nuked and dried. \u00a0The toast and potatoes were both nice; although, I think one or the other would be enough starch for me.I can't opine on the refried beans as the person who ordered this dish requested NO BEANS. \u00a0One observation, they do not appear to be refried. * scrambled eggs w home-cured gravadlax, avocado, cream cheese & toast - Again the eggs were perfectly cooked. \u00a0I believe chives were mixed into the eggs which was a nice addition. \u00a0Not sure what the cured gravadlax (my first ever) was supposed to taste like, but it tasted like a mixture of lox, sashimi and ceviche - not a bad mixture if you ask me!* Americano \u00a0- only available in one (smallish) size* Flat white - only available in one (smallish) sizeHighly recommend for the cool, laid back neighbourhood caf\u00e9 vibe and simple, well executed food. \u00a0 \u00a0Also, given the quality and service, the meal was a good value. All in, we left for \u00a324.",

This was well served but appeared to be quite minimal. The fruit wasn't the tastiest and was limited to apples mainly. The yoghurt was also not the tastiest, although maybe it was meant to be plain. Although appears to be q favourite for more breakfast menus, this restaurant never quite ticks all my boxes.",
