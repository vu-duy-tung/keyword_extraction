Go early to avoid dissapointment as it's always busy and fully booked. You can pick your fish from a fresh, constantly changing, selection and have it grilled/baked/fried however you wish.Oysters, mussels, lobsters and of course Fruit de Mare (seafood mix platter) are all available too.The restaurant has been revamped since visiting last and has toned down the bright blue wall and paintings to a more calm green paneling and classic black and white photos of Brixham (where the fish is caught). They have failed to tart up the corridor and steps down to the toilets, which is a shame as it's starting to look grubby.The service is pleasant but a little forced at times, and the open counter where they prepare drinks is too open for staff to argue (a little). The table next to ours had to wait for one of their starters but we had no complaints about timing, even when we ordered a dressed Dartmouth crab.Overall I think this a very pleasant night out, but maybe save it for a special occasion because of the price.",

Besides, we ordered fresh raw oysters but the waiter didn't take the order - and then it took time to confirm if we can get oysters or not we wasted the 2hr limit. In the end, we each ordered fish or meat plate. But that's it. We wanted to enjoy the time more without any rush. All the grilled fishes were good. But to be fair I felt they were a little pricey.",

Prawns were also over-cooked and were also overly soft in their consistence. \u00a0Hand-Dived solitary grilled scallop was only saving grace of whole dish.21 Day Matured Sirloin of Beef (main) - Ordered due to not being in the mood for seafood, aware that it could be slightly risky ordering meat in a seafood restaurant. What I was subsequently served surpassed all expectations, in the worst possibly way. Requested medium rare, served a cut of beef that was over-cooked even if you had ordered it well done. The beef was one of toughest cuts I've ever had, and even if they would have given me a meat cleaver with my fork it would have still been a struggle to make headway. Poor quality in general, completely ruined by the seafood being totally over-cooked and a cut of beef not fit for human consumption. \u00a0One star is for the passable prawn cocktail and the one solitary scallop.",

As a bit of a foodie I must say it was a really good.We started with the fish soup and the smoked salmon. The soup was great and we really liked the little grill cheese toasters on the side for dipping. The smoked salmon was really nice with a generous helping of capers and bread, nothing too outstanding though.For the mains we had fish and chips and the seared tuna. We loved the fish and chips, especially the tartar sauce served with it. The tuna however wasn't to my liking as it was wrapped in a thick layer of pepper which overcame the delicious taste of fresh tuna.So all in all, loved it and I would recommend it. The portions are generous and the fish is really fresh, just don't expect anything other than simple.",

Yet venture further inside and you'll find a cosy little restaurant hiding at the back.FishWorks emphasise the importance of seasonal and local produce adding the chain (there are eleven in total across London and the South West) to London's array of self-aware eateries. With growing concerns over depleting natural fish stocks FishWorks decision to offer special landings whilst adhering to a policy of avoiding certain fish during breeding periods is not only fantastically ethically aware, but coincidently the choice throws up a continually updated and interesting menu.Although unfortunately the lobster, oysters and sea bass were all a little surprisingly off the menu by the time of our 8pm booking, this was soon forgotten as the knowledgeable waiter suggested alternatives, detailing particulars for those who don't know their Fruits de Mer from their fish finger. We settled on the 'Mixed Seafood' and 'Shellfish Grill' and the 'Swordfish Milanese with Fennel' from the classic rather than overly adventurous menu. Simple desserts are just as tasty with fresh fruit flavours prevailing, from Lemon Tart to Eton Mess. A thoughtful and extensive selection of wines really is the icing on the cake, with a decent selection served by the glass or half bottle, beginning at \u00a35.95 for a large glass and \u00a315.95 a bottle. Overall, mouth watering food and impeccable service made the experience effortlessly enjoyable proving that the expanding FishWorks chain continue to successfully nurture a sustainable ethos and understanding of what one would expect from 'fresh fish', 'the catch of the day' and other such terms, which are unfortunately concepts often lost at sea for many fish restaurants of a similar price tag.",

All chic boutiques and pavement cafes crowded with pretty young things. Heading into the restaurant the first thing you notice are the gorgeous, high piles of fish and crustacea by the entrance. Sadly they are also the first things you smell. Although striking, there is something unpleasant about walking through a pungent cloud of fish to get to your table. Would totally recommend booking through top table as there is currently a spectacular offer on the al a carte. All the mains were delicious \u00a0tuna was perfect, as were garlicky prawns. Sadly sides were disappointing \u00a0bland spinach and a peculiar side salad drenched in oil. Also, inattentive service marred the experience somewhat. No one manning front of house meant we had to walk to the back to find someone to seat us, and I practically had to rugby tackle a waiter to order desert and a coffee. However, would still recommend as the food definitely makes up for it. If you like fish.",

I came here last night with a party of four, happy to see that the front of the shop is a fishmonger, and the fish is all incredibly fresh. We started with scallops and the greek salad - the scallops, as I said, were great. For mains, we had lobster linguine, crab bisque special, fish & chips, and the cod special. The linguine was good, I just didn't like that there was so little lobster (and what lobster there was, was in tiny chunks). I was hoping for something meatier, especially from half a lobster. The crab bisque, too, was good but slightly disappointing because it wasn't what we expected. It was less of a bisque and more of a broth, and it was a bit spicy. The fish and chips were very good, especially the batter along the edges. It had the age-old problem of the middle being a bit soft and mushy, though. The cod was probably the best meal of the night, cooked simply and well, and a nice portion. The carrot side was very nice, too - honey roasted carrots with cumin. A bit nitpicky, but the bathrooms were a bit creepy and quite smelly. It's the smelly part that was a turn off, I'm not blaming them for the architecture that puts the bathrooms down stairs and down a further corridor.",
