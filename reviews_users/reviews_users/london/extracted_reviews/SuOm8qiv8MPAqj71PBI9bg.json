This place surpasses any ramen shop I visited in Boston or NewYork (yes, more impressive than Totto or Sapora etc.) I ordered the Tan Tan Ramen, whose soup base is AMAZING - with a touch of spiciness but not too heavy; make sure to choose to have noodle cooked the hardest way. My fianc\u00e9 had another ramen (sry forgot the name lol) which was equally fantastic, and his soup base tastes totally different from mine - unlike a lot of other ramen places where dishes share similar base. Service is decent. We arrived ~9pm Sunday night and there was no queue.",

My friend and I were lucky to make it to the shop before the kitchen closes (they close 30 min before their posted closing time). We didn't have that much time left to order but we were definitely satisfied with what we got!We both ordered the Piri Piri Shoryu Ramen, it's the spicy version of the Shoryu Ramen. We both loved our ramen! The noodles tasted very fresh and the broth was very flavorful and had the right amount of spice! I wouldn't recommend getting the Piri Piri if you are just looking for a little bit of heat. The green tea and raspberry mochi were the perfect treat to end our dinner.I forgot to mention that service was really friendly too. I've had good ramen back in the a States before and I think this place is very good. The only downside about it is that everything is so expensive in London. Back in the States, you can get a lot of extra toppings and customize your own ramen for much cheaper at very well known ramen shops. However, it is what it is and I definitely enjoyed Shoryu Ramen! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! :)",

Soup tasted like it had noodle flour in it and also the kitchen had dumped a massive pile of pickled ginger on top which made the soup taste oddly fishy. The draft beer was Kirin, decent but not spectacular- on the menu it said that it would be served very cold but it was several degrees above that. Price for a bowl of ramen 12 quid, with today's exchange rate making the ramen at least 3 times what one would pay for the same food in Japan. Service was friendly if a bit disorganized on a crowded Saturday afternoon, but the buy 1 ramen get the second half-off coupon that I used made up for any slowness and probably saved Shoryu from a trip to 2-starland, for now three is the number of the stars thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three.",

Intrigued, I went back the next day, stood in line in the cold for half an hour having no idea what was expecting me. Basically, I didn't know what ramen was until I stepped foot here.Obviously, I've seen the light and consider myself a convert. My new religion is ramen. Ramen is a bowl of soup, mostly on pork stock, with noodles, half an egg, some veggies - but the description doesn't do it justice, as ramen is a state of mind. The absolutely sensational feeling of well being when you sip on the soup, chew on the noodles. Then the wonderful feeling hours after you've had your ramen.. Ahh.. I usually go for the Tokyo Ramen, but last time Ulrik tried the cold ramen and it was soooo good! A new favourite for sure.Go, wait in line, eat, be happy!",

    "text": "We were around Regent/Piccadilly Circus after watching a musical in this area so we stopped by this place to eat Ramen. Their selection of dishes on their menu is wide, so you will find something you like. If you are not familiar with Japanese food, they also have a glossary on their menu in case you have trouble with finding out what you want and need a closer explanation. We ordered a Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu, their signature dish with extra meat, and also some fried gyoza. We finished our ramen and also our beer, and waited long for the gyoza. So we had to ask, and it seems they had forgotten about this order. They apologized and made the food right away when we pointed that out, so it was not the end of the world. But normally the gyoza should have come before the ramen as gyoza is considered more as an appertizer. So in short this a good place to eat Ramen with good service, but it is not the best Ramen place around this area as they have a lot of competition here.",

I didn't go full GF as I got the Shoryu ganso tonkotsu but with rice noodles instead of egg noodles. For full GF you have the choice of two soy milk and white miso ramen. My ramen was so deeeelicious and the egg was just perfect. Really good pork too. All in all amazing. My husband had the Dracula ramen...woah, he stunk so bad afterwards and we were going to the theatre, hahaha! And yep, it was even worse the morning after. Prepare yourself for the most garlicy dish ever. It was delicious though. We also had the traditional Japanese chicken wings on ice for starter, just because it sounded cool. The wings were nice though I'm not sure why they are served on ice...My husband also got the winter sake flight, 3 types of sake (35ml each I think) for \u00a36.50 with an explanation of what each one was. A great idea to educate people about sake!There were so many other interesting things here, the sides, the drinks. What a great meal! Will definitely be coming back...is tomorrow too soon?!",

    "text": "We got there by sunday lunchtime on a cold day and there was already a couple of people queueing. it didn't take too long though (luckily it wasn't raining) and we were shown to our table. the place is rather small and these were two tables joined together, with table 2 already occupied. i don't know why they couldn't have separated the tables before we took our seats but that's fine, we did it ourselves.I had a steamed pork bun as a started and the price was quite steep for what is essentially a mini sandwich. The meat was somewhat flavoursome, but a bit dry and sat awkwardly inside the bun, trying to escape as I bit into it. I don't know, presentation wasn't great and I felt there was little value for money. I had the traditional ramen with two lovely half eggs and bits of pork that were ok, but not mind blowingly good as the ones I had in Tokyo. The broth was substantial and nicely flavoured, but I must be honest and said I've had better here in London. The price is honest for what you get, though, and I've heard you can get a second portion of noodles free if you still have lots of broth left. For drinks I've ordered a frozen kirin but it came mildy warm and without the foam cap it was supposed to have. I was disappointed to say the least.Overall the food ain't bad, it's just not awesome enough to make me queue or even go for another visit. And I believe you could have better elsewhere.",

I ordered their classic Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu and it was just delicious. Aghh buttery and rich and flavorful....aghh im salivating thinking of it all over again. It was about 11 GBP (around $16 USD) for a bowl which is a little more expensive then the $12 bowls I am used to in DC (I guess both are kind of expensive for a bowl of soup when you think about it), then again this is London and everything is expensive here. ANYWAY back to the food. It was delicious and I would definitely give it my recommendation!",

Tan Tan would be my second fave. The boiled egg is perfectly made every time too! Deco is trendy and modern. Service is hospitable and quick. Lucky for us, when we went both times, there wasn't really a wait. Shoryu is right next to Piccadilly, so perfect for a stroll before or after you wine and dine!",

I highly recommend this ramen spot for anyone looking for some quality food with a nice fun atmosphere. For dessert I had the green tea cheesecake and the texture and flavor was on point. If I had more room in my stomach, I would have also got the yuzu cheesecake. That will have to be for my next visit to London. Amazing food with quality, friendly inviting staff, fun atmosphere",

So basically when you come to Shoryu Ramen in London, the deception is normal.The Waguy Beef Hirata is BAD, very fatty, the bun doesn't hold and it is drenched in mayonnaise !! (\u00a37.5)The fried chichen Ramen, is a large portion with several big pieces of Fried chicken (bland) that lost their crispness because of the broth.The broth is flavourful but nothing compared to Ippudo.The 1 star is for the location.The minus 4 stars are basically more for the lack of service i got from the staff. \u00a0They are not motivated and not welcoming. I really was about to leave cause i felt i disturbed them. They were several empty seats/table but they offered the one very mext to the main door (bear in mind it is freezing outside and the clients are entering and flgoing out from this door)When i insisted to get the seat inside that i knew was free they told me no. I was abot to give up but eventually they gave me that seat after mumbling about me.That is how my experience started at shoryu and believe me l, i was still expecting the food to be good despite the attitude of some staff.It is very expensive for nothing and no need to say that i won't recommend it.",

The meat was very juicy, a little bit too salty, but I liked it that way. There was a good portion of noodles and the bowl was quite large. I also liked the spicyness of the ramen dish!If I lived in London, I would eat here as often as I could!

However, ramen in Japan is a serious topic, can be the theme for life. I think it could earn four stars as the quality of food was great overall, but the bean sprout tasted old, kinda sourly almost people from FSA will question about its freshness. Shame.Maybe it's one off.Thus highly recommended for a casual dinner.",

Shoryu satisfies all my cravings and it amazing!Coming from New York, I have a pretty high standard for ramen (at least I would like to think so), so once I moved here, I had to find here I could feast on delicious pork belly and noodles. After reading a bunch of reviews I tried a few places out, and so far Shoryu is my favorite. I've been back a few times since finding it too. Each time I come hungry because the bowls are massive! And of course I have to save room for the fantastic hirata pork buns!The place is relatively small and cramped, but that's London for small restaurants. It is still very nice and the atmosphere is great. Servers greet you when you come in and the servers are always nice and efficient. If you need a dose of ramen in your life check this place out. I have gone with native Chinese and Japanese friends and they give their stamp of approval too! The broth is always salty and deliciously umami-like, the meet is tender, and the noodles don't lose their sogginess after ten minutes in the bowl, which is nice. Go, feast, enjoy, return.",

Love love loooove.When I first entered the restaurant, gongs were sounded based by the number of people you have in your party. *so honoured* Then we were sat, and a complimentary small saucer filled with cold yet crunchy cabbage(?) is served. For my first time here I ordered the Dracula ramen. It is one of the newer food options and it's delicious! Definitely gives you garlic breath after to ward off the vampires later on, but who cares? Great food requires great sacrifices. Second time was Yuzu ramen for me. Might feel weird at first glance because yuzu is a citrus fruit, but when mixed with the salty tonkotsu base, it is actually something quite sensational. Not one of my favourites, but my impression of Shoryu is still higher than ever. Love the ambience here as well - although everyone is sat pretty close, it's not too noisy and the lighting and overall decoration and furniture makes it a good mix of classy and cosy. The service here is amazing - I can tell that they try to emulate the Japanese service here, and that makes it so welcoming to me. Price-wise is reasonable in comparison to other ramen restaurants in London. Shoryu definitely wins in the value-for-money department. Will come back again and again and again. I'll never be bored of ramen.",

Ramen is pretty much tailor made for miserable London winters and as the days get progressively greyer and grimmer, I'll be making a beeline for Shoryu. You should too. The noodles are fresh and bountiful (perhaps a little too bountiful but there are worse problems to have, hey), the broth rich and flavoursome and the meat and veggies seasoned to perfection. The gyoza is also pretty great, but there's no way you'll have space for it after the ramen. Honestly, if I didn't you won't. On top of this, the setup is really nice and cosy and does away with the canteen style feel that often comes with ramen spots. I'll be back.",

Pork belly was ok - doesn't quite melt in your mouth and of course you couldnt go wrong with the mayo. Mmmm. I also tried the gluten free hirata bun and they microwaved it!! So the ends ended up being very hard. But where I could chew it was actually tasty and the texture quite good - not as soft and pillowy but decent and tasty! If you are going for the gf hirata buns (which only comes in chicken), ask them not to microwave but to steam it. \u00a0The matcha tea was absolutely disappointing.

Seems like the pork belly was old and the buns were not soft at all - instead of being nicely steamed it tasted and looked like frozen microwaved pork buns. The ramen was underwhelming as well. The eggs were not cooked how I liked (yokey yellow and brown soy sauce soaked). The noodles were ok, I've had much better. The noodles tasted like they were sitting out in room temperature for too long. The broth was very watered down.

Very visually appealing and definitely worth the 12 pounds-ish that I paid for it. The seating is a bit close together and it can be uncomfortable if you are here to have some intimate conversation.

I must say I was quite pleased with my selection... the broth was tasty, not too heavy, and the portion size was just right. Another treat was the Genmai Tea, I couldn't stop drinking it, it was so good! Oh yeah, get the gyoza. There's nothing ever really special about gyoza, but it's always good.

We accompanied the Ramen with steamed pork buns that were very good though!! The layout of the restaurant is a little bit awkward also, the entrance door inconveniences at least two tables and if you need to use the only toilet then you will again have to disturb people.Overall, fairly good and slightly cheaper than the rest but defiantly trailing \u00a0the others in my opinion.",

We went on the soft-opening week which meant the line was even longer although props to the staff for shoving us in as fast as possible and having no qualms about asking random people to sit together. \u00a0However, I didn't quite understand why they split the group up when the table the first pair was given was more than enough for all of us. We swapped the randoms for our friends and everyone was happy (except for the waitress who looked like she was about to punch a hole in the wall).The Ramen itself was good (I chose the Shoryu Special) with a rich creamy white broth that was an excellent argument on its own for taking the slow boil method for making tonkotsu stock. The pork itself wasn't that flavourful and I remember being a little disappointed in the low amount of veggies. Those that were there were excellent and so was the egg. The bowl is a massive serving and I happily slurped my way into fatty pork nirvana.It's a bit cramped inside with the planners seemingly hell bent on working out how to maximise the number of people per square meter. Be prepared to get close to some strangers and even cosier with your friends. Then again, we all survive the tube in rush hour so by comparison this is downright luxurious! In the London Ramen rankings, the overall food is good but not enough to dethrone Bone Daddies as the London Ramen King!",

    "text": "And so continues my ramen quest! \u00a0I just moved here, and I'm on a mission to find my favorite ramen restaurant in London. \u00a0So far nothing makes me want to strip naked and jump inside the hot vat of soupy goodness, ecstatically yelling YES as I beat two slices of pickled turnips together in excitement.Shoryu was half full by the time I got there at 7 pm, but packed by the time I left at 8. \u00a0I was seated quickly, and ordered the \u00a39.9 Takana Tonkotsu with a \u00a33 side of menma and \u00a31.5 of egg, as well as the \u00a36 shishito peppers. \u00a0Nice but quite expensive additions. \u00a05 minutes later (I do appreciate the fast service here, way faster than Bone Daddy's), I had a hot steaming bowl of ramen. \u00a0They're not stingy with the portion either.The noodles were al dente and the broth was certainly flavorful, but missing the fattiness that I prefer. \u00a0In fact, it was a bit watery. I preferred the pork at BD as it was softer and fattier. \u00a0Update: I came here again, and ordered the Wasabi Tonkotsu and Karaka Miso Buta Tonkotsu. \u00a0Loved the Buta Tonkotsu, there were tons of ground pork in it and the noodles were perfect! \u00a0Couldn't really taste much of the wasabi in the other tonkotsu, definitely preferred the Buta.",

    "text": "IMO, far and away the best ramen in London (after Shoryu, of the places I've been I'd rank them Tonkotsu, Ittenbari, Bone Daddies, Yugo, Mitsukoshi). Good noodles, egg is of the perfect doneness, and the tonkotsu broth is fantastic, very balanced.My personal favorite (and supposedly the favorite of the staff) is the Karaka Tantan Tonkotsu, spicier and with garlic.I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area and I'd say Shoryu is similar in quality to Ramen Dojo there, and also similar in that they both have spicy ramen. Personally, I don't think anywhere else in London comes close.",

    "text": "The key to a great ramen is the broth. The broth here is great, therefore the ramen is great.I had the char siu ramen - the original ramen plus extra pork, and my wife had the Dracula ramen, which had caramelised garlic. I got to try her broth at the end: it was garlicky indeed, but still very nice. Noodles were cooked just right and the pork slices were nice. As you would expect, mine had a lot of pork slices which were a treat. An unusual element was the pickled ginger. It's a surprise when you eat it, but makes for a good occasional contrast to the rest of the ramen.We got our usual sides of karaage chicken and gyoza. The gyoza came with a nice ginger dipping sauce. The karaage chicken was made from chicken breast, which was ok but I have noticed that the thigh meat has more flavour and is juicier.We got an Asahi each too. They came with a half pint glass of the sort you would find in an English pub, which I liked.Our total bill came to \u00a348 with service. \u00a0This is about average or just under for the ramen places that we have visited in London. I would come back here, but probably just for the ramen.The place is an easy walk, just down the hill, from Picadilly tube station. \u00a0There was a small queue outside when we got there at around 6:30pm and this grew during the evening. \u00a0This is something to bear in mind - however, ramen appears to be one of the trendy things at the moment, so most good ramen places would be like this.",

    "text": "If you're wondering about that wasabi tonkotsu, I too was curious before finally coming here on Sunday.. I had checked out their ramen selection in advance to see what they had to offer compared to the other ramen joints..and wasabi ramen is definitely a new one for me. So I will start with the con. They have a scoop of pasty wasabi shavings when your bowl is brought out untouched, along with the atypical bean sprouts, earwigs, pork, and two sheets of seaweed (sorry, gotta pay extra for an egg!). The pasty wasabi shaving was not very potent, especially when I mixed it in with my broth. The beauty of wasabi is that spicy zing shooting up one's nose with every bite, and I had imagined every bite of this ramen would do me the same justice; on the contrary, it was very subtle. I have seen broth prepared with wasabi oil to give it a strong kick but this broth is not wasabi flavored and the only thing giving it the wasabi love was the scoop of wasabi bits on top of the noodles. Don't get me wrong, the broth was excellent, very milky and not overtly salty.. but just wasn't what I was expecting when ordering wasabi tonkotsu. While there's no doubt you can make out the faint taste of wasabi, the taste was too repressed for me. Don't lie to yourself and say you've ever gone for wasabi wishing it were only a faint kick! In my opinion, if the depth of wasabi flavor is not there, it really is just another bowl of tonkotsu ramen, with a hint of wasabi. I told the waitress who said she'd convey it to the chef, so maybe there will be a slight change next time?On the other hand, the ramen had veerry good noodles. I am a big fan of thin straight ramen noodles (as opposed to curly or flat ones). These were straight, firm, and a little chewy, which to me is an example of well-made ramen noodles. It's always easy to make it too soggy and I don't enjoy it when it's bordering that opaque look, but as I said, these were firm chewy tender noodles with great flavor. They were very yellow too, so these were probably made with a higher egg content, giving it that yellow hue and flavor that reminds me of Chinese egg noodles (but with nicer texture). Another pro was that the egg was pretty delicious as well. It's no \"dayum..dayum..DAYUM\" (see review on Bone Daddies on my usage of the Dayum scale) but still great execution. It was not as runny as I would like it but it wasn't overcooked and you can still see the soft, creamy, orangey glow in the middle. So the main difference was that it wasn't as beautifully runny like Bone Daddies' egg, but to me it was marinated to perfection and not overly salty as Bone Daddies' eggs. The same goes for the pork. They were not overwhelming large slices; in fact, I usually save the pork for the end and when I reached the end, in hindsight, I think I only got one slice total? It was either one slice or one and a half slices. Not the most protein one could wish for but it was tasty. And I was too busy wolfing down my noodles anyways. Lastly, Shoryu Ramen doesn't have a bar area for one-person parties (is it a party if there's only one person :( ?). I always think ramen joints should keep with tradition to have single seats, for those who want to sidle in for a quick eat. That's the true beauty of eating ramen like fast-food as they do in Japan! Instead, they have a couple of small tables, and a long booth seat along the wall with small tables to section parties off. Meh, guess I'll just have to find some friends to come with!",

I'd say this is my favourite ramen place above others such as Bone Daddies, Koya or Tonkotsu. I think the broth and noodle have the best texture/consistency/flavour out of them all!

I came on a weekday afternoon around 4pm, it was pretty empty at that time and I was seated immediately.I ordered the special Hakata Tonkotsu ramen with spicy ground pork. It was very rich and flavorful. I could really taste the good quality of each of the ingredients, and then broth had a very unique taste compared to other ramen broths I've had.Service and ambiance were good, no complaints as I did come at an off peak time.I would recommend this place for good quality, flavorful ramen!",

    "text": "So I was with someone who's been here before and after a rather long debate, this place seemed to be one of the few places that are open late (up to London standards that is). The ambience was nice and the decor as per the usual ramen bar (no Bone Daddies rockability theme here).The food seemed rather adventurous for a ramen place - an interesting mix of flavours with funky names. It did take some time for it to arrive at the table (especially given the fact that everyone was leaving by the time we got there).Anyway, pretty good food, matching that generally offered in London. I've ordered the Tokyo Shoryu. \u00a0The broth was fine, the noodles tasted rather good and he toppings were OK, just your typical japanese inspired out-of-the-tin vegetables with meat. Soft shell crab was rather soggy, but I wasn't expecting any miracles here.What was excruciatingly horrible was the service. Yes, we turned up late and our food was late. However when I discovered a hair in my food I got extremely upset by the fact that no one had the courage to come to me and apologise/offer a refund as they usually do in such places. I hadn't touched more than half of my food and no response - extremely unprofessional and definitely not what one would expect from such a central London location. I saw the floor manager who was only able to offer an apology and had the service charge taken - something that I found rather disrespectful for both the staff and I as the service was generally good.I don't know if I'd go back - possibly I'd try the other branch but this place needs to invest more on customer care.",

Something that stood out to me and I just have to mention it, is that they have a heat lamp for all of us eager ramen-craving freezing patrons right outside of the entrance. How thoughtful :) We started with the pork belly hirata buns. The bread was fluffy and the meat was tender, delicious. A little bit of spiciness, which was unexpected but tolerable enough for a spice-wimp like me. Then came the main event. I had the Tokyo Shoyu and it was amazing. The broth was full of flavour and the pork, veggies & noodles were all delectable. The portion was enormous and I was fully stuffed and satisfied at the end of the meal. Great place!",

I got the spicy ramen and it was a little spicier than I anticipated but yummy nonetheless. The only thing I'd say I don't like is that the portions are smaller than any other ramen restaurant I've been to and the prices are a tiny bit higher, so the value isn't quite there. Usually, I have difficulty finishing my portion but I probably could've eaten a few more bites after I was done this time. Maybe don't come if you're starving but it's a good small meal if you're not terribly famished.",

The takoyaki is different from the ordinary ones as they are deep fried. So it's crispy outside. It's \u00a36.9 for 5 pieces but in each one, there's only a tiny piece of octopus.

You can also choose how you want the noodles to be cooked (from standard to soft to hard).

    "text": "I was actually at the location at Carnaby St. and when I went to go check this place out on yelp, I didn't realize that Shoryu was a small franchise and that there were several locations around London. The place on Carnaby St was small, but cozy and pretty lively on a Sunday night. I was seated at the booth and started to chat up with the bartenders. It was my first time, so they explained that they specialize in tonkotsu ramen and went through the pretty large menu with a lot of different ramen options and side dishes. I decided on the Kimchi Seafood tonkotsu because I love spice. I was also able to customize the texture of my ramen (standard, hard, super hard) which I thought was interesting as I have never had that option given to me before. I also got gyoza (because obviously you should get that with every ramen dish) as well as a steamed pork belly bun to start. Also, if you like lychee, definitely try the pink lychee jasmine tea, you won't regret it! The steamed bun came on the mini wooden steamer which I thought was super cute and the pork belly was super flavourful and the bun was also very soft and delicious. The gyoza I absolutely loved!! The crispy layer on the dumping as well as the filling were SO good and not overly salty. I definitely wish I ordered more. The ramen itself was definitely good, but I found the broth to be standard and definitely not as spicy as I wished it to be. It was very mild. I loved that they were very generous on the seafood and I had a lot of it in my ramen. Great sized portion and reasonably priced! While it wasn't busy, I found the service to be a little slow. Overall, I was pretty happy with the place and I probably would return if I could!",

Proceeded to rush into the bathroom with mud butt diarrhea and then vomit. Aside from the bout of foodborne illness I'm currently experiencing, the food was less than mediocre at best. This was my first time here and I ordered the Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu. The tonkotsu broth is nothing to write home about (incredibly bland for boasting that it takes 12 hours to cook), the chashu was flavorless, and the noodles were... well, comparatively similar to everything else that's supposedly good about their ramen. When the ramen was brought out, the broth and egg were cold but the noodles were hot. At the end, I couldn't bring myself to finish the bowl and that's rare as I normally devour ramen instantly.Overall, 10/10 would AVOID this place like the bubonic plague.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Shoryu for years so this recent visit was extremely disappointing because I am familiar with their usual level of service and quality of food. When I was seated I sat there for maybe ten minutes before I had to ask someone for a menu, while other parties were sat after me and given menus right away. These same parties were also given the opportunity to order before I was. I made eye contact with several waiters, signaling that I was ready to order and they ignored me, continuing to chat to each other behind the counter. It wasn't until another ten minutes that I was given the opportunity to order. I ordered my usual prawn tempura shoryu bun and a piri piri tonkotsu. When the shoryu bun comes out, there is usually a wrapped wet wipe so that you can clean your hands before you pick up the bun but they didn't give me anything and I had difficulty getting anyone's attention again so I just gave up and ate the bun which tasted great, as usual. When my tonkotsu came out, the nitamago was really overdone to where there was no runny yolk quality, and about 90% of the yolk was a crumbling yellow rather than a silky orange. When I asked for another egg, the waitress asked what was wrong with it and I told her it was overdone and how it's supposed to be soft boiled (I had to explain to her what a proper nitamago looks like while I'm sitting in front of a chalkboard with the definitions of the different elements that make up a ramen, one of which is a definition of a nitamago). She came back with another egg that was still over cooked but better than the my initial egg claiming \"this is the best we've got\". \u00a0Other than the egg, the ramen was delicious. Finally, when I asked for my check they brought me the bill right away and I sat with my credit card in my hand for maybe 15 minutes before I had to again ask if I could pay. A new waitress came and asked if I wanted to pay by card, and I asked her if the 12.5% service charge could be taken off because out of all the years I've been here I've never experienced such awful service. She just sulked away and came back with an adjusted bill, not once making an attempt to ask why I felt that way or inquire as to what they could do to improve. She merely processed my transaction in complete silence and then walked away. I would also like to add that I was not the only one experiencing poor customer service. There was a six-top of Australian diners behind me who asked for water from at least three different waiters and also said they were ready to order, to which the waitress who processed my bill replied in a really harsh and rude tone \"it's coming! I've already asked!\" And another waiter turned up and told them \"you're just going to have to wait!\"I usually go to the carnaby branch so maybe it's my mistake for going to a different location but I've been to this location in the past too. I don't think I will return to this branch but look forward to going to another branch soon",

We ended up walking round and found this place! I went in to ask for a table for three and was told it was bout 15 min wait, and the queue was outside, as no room inside to stand! They do have a heater outside so it's not too bad. When we got our table, they explained how the menu worked with the different styles of noodle and the bun offer where you can get 2 for 1 if you order ramen noodles.We decided to try the buns, and ordered one pork one and a chicken one. We each had noodles and two of us ordered an extra half boiled egg each. You can have the noodles al dente, standard or soft. The original ramen dish was nice, I really liked the egg, it was soft boiled.I had a mocktail strawberry kusu mojito which was very refreshing. The place is small, but looks great, the staff are nice though we found our waitress a little hard to understand and had to go back and ask her what she meant.My friend did order more buns to take home to her husband as they were nice.",

Being relatively new to Ramen I was excited to try another place and another type.We arrived and had to wait 10 minutes for a table. Be warned: You do have to wait outside for tables so maybe not the best option if freezing or raining but we were happy to wait as it was a mild night and it smelt so god damn good!We were seated on a long bench by the wall, at first we were a bit disappointed not to have a proper table but in the end we quite enjoyed it.We ordered the gyoza and pork and prawn buns to share. Then I ordered the curry ramen in the others section.The sides came first which I was glad about being staring. The gyoza was freshly cooked and mouth-wateringly good. The pieces of meat inside were chunky and they just went down a treat!Now, to the buns, it was the first time I'd ever had a 'bun' and I absolutely LOVED them. Whatever that weird type foldy bread is, it's amazing and the toppings were superb. I particularly liked the belly pork! NOW.Next, the ramen. Gosh it was good - garlic, curried soupy goodness with bites sized pieces of friend chicken breast, veg, seaweed and egg floating within. Just perfection. The curry had an almost katsu taste to it which I enjoyed and with the extra clove of garlic, I was in a ramen dream. It was slightly salty but I am a fan of salt so no complaints here! Service was fantastic and the overall ambience of the restaurant is relaxed and warming. We left full, satisfied and saying we'd definitely be back again.Happy Saturday!",

Even this was a squeeze. I went for the shoryu pork ramen and my partner went for the curry flavoured chicken ramen. we had pork buns on the side to share. The dishes came quickly and were well presented. I really enjoyed the pork broth and the slowed cooked egg was perfect. The pork buns though seemed a little unloved and a bit thrown together.

I ordered their Tonkotsu ramen, gyoza and pork bun. I thought all of the food was very average, but not bad. The tonkotsu broth lacked something, but it was not flavorful enough while the noodles were a bit soft for my taste. Not a bad bowl of ramen but not one that is memorable. The gyoza was presented on a sizzling skillet, very cool. However, the flavor of the gyoza stuffing was also lacking something, perhaps sesame oil? The pork bun used a miso paste of some sort and was my least favorite thing I ordered that day. Okay for a quick bowl if you're craving one but probably not one I would recommend people to go out of their way to get. They do have free wifi.",

From all the Shroyus it has the best atmosphere by far! It's not as crowded/ small as the others, the wood-paneled walls give it a warm feel and the lighting and decor is just right. The food of course is amazing. We shared the pimentos and the Chicken Karaage (a definite MUST at Shoryu), and for our mains I had the Curry Ramen- bursting with flavor and totally filling, while my friend, who likes her dishes a little more spicy, chose the Karaka Tan Tan Tonkotsu.Service was attentive and speedy, place was buzzing with people. You can't go wrong with this place to fulfill your Ramen Needs!",

    "text": "Came here after seeing it on yelp. I was having a crazy ramen craving and this seemed like a legit spot, so I gave it a try. I'm sure glad I did!I came at about 5 PM on a weekday and the place was about half full. I was immediately greeted by the waitstaff and seated at the tables facing the window (one of the perks of dining alone- you can people watch!). Its on Regent Street, smack dab in between Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square so there's plenty of foot traffic going by. The restaurant is somewhat small but has a very modern-style Japanese decor theme. The menu is short and sweet, but they have plenty of varieties of ramen for every taste. I originally leaned towards the curry ramen but ultimately went with the piri-piri ramen after reading peoples' rave reviews. I put in my order for a cocktail (only \u00a36 during happy hour!) and ramen, and both were out within 10 minutes. My cocktail -whose name I cannot remember- tasted like a mai tai and was definitely strong... but enjoyable. The ramen came out piping hot with lots of goodies on top of the bed of noodles. The noodles were cooked to the perfect al-dente consistency but I was a little disappointed in the lack of spiciness. Since this is their spicy option, I expected a little more of a kick. There was also a little bit too much lemongrass for my own personal tastes but not so much that it kept me from enjoying my meal. I noticed some reviews remarked on the small serving size but I felt it was the perfect size. I hadn't eaten all day and finished off most of my noodles, and felt more than satisfied. Overall, this is a great ramen place if you're in central London. The service was super friendly and attentive. The ramen itself was really tasty and they have all kinds of varieties to try. I definitely think its worth checking out if you get the chance!",

    "text": "As a ramen junkie from NYC, I've been traveling around London's ramen scene to try and find the best bowl here. Shoryu piqued my interest due to the fact that they tout their Hakata roots, which is the region of Japan that tonkotsu ramen is specialized. So I had to come by and try the tonkotsu broth!I stopped in around noon and was seated immediately. I ordered the Kotteri Tonkotsu Ramen, a chashu pork bun, and a grilled halloumi and shimeji mushroom bun.The ramen came out first, which was a bit strange, but I started eating. The broth was not as rich as I like my tonkotsu ramen to be. It has what I've complained about most NYC ramen - I call it the \"Ippudo Problem,\" where the tonkotsu broth is the specialty but is not super rich. Tonkotsu broth should be thick, bony, and hearty, but the broth here (which was said to be extra rich) is pretty thin. Also, it was a bit under seasoned, a bit bland. I don't like my broths salty but I do like some flavor in the soup.The noodles here are missing that signature bite that ramen noodles have (even when I ordered it hard), almost just like regular egg noodles.You can thank Momofuku and David Chang for the steamed buns with ramen trend around the world, and the buns here have the same problem that the ones at Momofuku Noodle Bar in NYC does - they are overly sauced with a very strong sauce that masks the flavor of the main ingredient and you basically are eating a bao with sauce and some meat/protein rather than getting a nice complex bite of flavors and textures. It's a shame, because I only really tasted the cucumber because it was not as salty as the rest of it. I actually had to wash it down with the broth (really shows you how bland it was).I ordered kaedama and it came out quickly, but they didn't put any tare or sauce on the noodles, so when I put it into the bowl, it watered it down a bit and made it blander.Overall, this was a pretty average bowl of ramen. There are many better bowls of ramen in London.",

    "text": "I almost always try the most basic ramen when I visit a new place, but this time I made an exception and went for one of my favorites, cold sesame ramen (Hiyashi Chuka). If you've never had this before, and it's a hot summer day, you should definitely give it a chance. Save the hot soup for colder weather.Noodles: Very good. Firm and cooked just right. Better than Bone Daddies IMO.Hiyashi Chuka sauce/tare: A bit to much sweetness, but overall very good.Tokyo egg: Perfectly cooked. However Bone Daddies tea smoked marinated egg is still one of the best I've ever had anywhere. Toppings: Menma (bamboo) not bad, needed \u00a0more crunch. Tomatoes were not the best - since they're in season now they could have been better. Charsu was a bit to dry, that's why most places use cooked ham typically (there \u00a0is no hot soup to soften the chasu). Nit picking now: Needed a small dab of mustard on the side (pretty standard). And cucumbers should be added too - especially since you're making it in England where they love cucumber too.Overall: A great bowl. In Tokyo I'd give it a 3, but for London it's top notch.Other stuff: Service was decent, but I find it really weird in London how so many servers don't seem to know squat about the food they're serving. Gyoza were good - and may have been made in house possibly (impressive).I will return to try the basic tonkatsu ramen when the weather changes.",

I saw a bunch of people waiting on line to get in but they were in parties of 3+ so I decided to go in and put myself on a list in case there was one. Turns out there is no list, the line is 'first come first served' but because I told them that I was just two people, we got to skip the line. Lesson: don't just follow the crowd. As per usual in London, it took a million years for them to take our order of a beer, cocktail, the tan tan ramen and the Dracula ramen. The cocktail, which was just soda and plum wine, wasn't very good. But, the ramens weren't all that bad. The minced pork ramen (\u00a310) was pretty much liquid fire for me, but my boyfriend managed fine. The Dracula ramen (\u00a311.90) had a richer broth that wasn't spicy and was really good when I added some rice vinegar to it. Good spot if you're looking for a change from the fish and chips, but I don't need to go back.",

The karaage had the perfect amount of crunch and the mentaiko was delicious without being overbearing (p.s. add some soy sauce to this if you'd like!). The ramen noodles had good texture and the broth was perfect without being too salty or heavy. I honestly ended up drinking the entire bowl.

Variety of noodle selections as well with choices of varying chewiness.The location itself was nice, with a tendency for couples or intimate dinners, but options for mid-sized and individual stool seating as well. All the staff were very friendly.Unfortunately they were out of the frozen Kirin when I went, but would definitely be interested in trying if I get the chance to return.",

    "text": "Ramen is one of my favourite foods to go out to eat, especially back in my hometown of Vancouver where there is certainly no shortage of ramen shops! Since moving to London, I've tried both Ippudo and Shoryu a few times, trying to figure out which one I liked more, and I've come to the conclusion that the broth at Shoryu is definitely tastier. The Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu is fantastic here (the broth, the noodles, and the charsiu all taste great). Sprinkle on some sesame seeds and garlic, and your bowl will taste even better! Service here has also been consistently good, even when the restaurant is busy. My only minor complaint is that their ramen eggs aren't as good as what I've had elsewhere (strangely they seem less flavourful?), but still not bad. Certainly not a big enough complaint to detract from the rest of the dish.I really don't have much else to say that the other 200+ reviews here haven't already said. Shoryu is probably my favourite ramen shop in London, and I will definitely return!",

This takes the great ramen we have had and bumps it into gourmet. Even what seemed like a boring choice, the origin tonkatsu, was surprisingly amazing, full of flavor. My 8 & 10 yo kids left nothing behind. (And they know their ramen.) I had the tan tan ramen as I always order at ramen houses and the egg is organic as evidence by the super orange yolk. The broth had depth and complexity. They use bones and you can tell. We were here on Monday so we got the 2for1 bun deal. The prawn buns were the real deal prawn size! The buns were large too, big enough to hold the prawns. The only complaint is that the buns took a long time to come out.",

    "text": "It seems like Shoryu Ramen is quite a big name in London, they got the restaurant in couple places. I hadn't heard that yet till when I was in London with my hubby. We were hungry for Asian cuisine, the Shoryu Ramen was one of the few which close to us. Since we both like Ramen, so we decided to head to this one. The restaurant was quite close to Piccadilly Circus and located right on the main street, so quite easy for us to find it. Inside the place was also really nice, It gave me a really nice feeling, the place is clean and modern but also got a Japanese culture in it. Although the restaurant wasn't big, we just like it here. When we were here, it was quite busy. It is always a good sign for a good restaurant. And luckily they were still managed a table for two for us, that was nice. After we sat down, we got a look of the menu, wow, lots of nice food in there, I would like to order. Well, I just wanted to try out the Ramen here first. And I forgot that outside of Germany, it is quite common that restaurant will gave free water on the table. We ordered extra drinks, well, got more options anyway. I really like the Ramen here, it tasted really good. But again still something was missing compared those I had tried back in Asia, I couldn't really tell what. But again it tasted still really great. I got the idea why this place was well-known here. The price was alright, quite reasonable. I did remember that will recommend to give tips 18%, that was quite a bit much, I think. There was also WIFI in the restaurant, quite convenient for people who need it.",

There wasn't a wait when I went but since the place is small - I wouldn't be surprised if there was one. The pork belly buns were just ok - they put way too much mayo in the buns which took away from the pork belly itself. I'd suggest omitting the mayo all together.The cucumber dish was alright - just a small cucumber with some sesame oil and hot flakes on top - super bland. It would have been so much better with a little vinegar.The ramen itself was good - decent portions - toppings were limited and expensive for extras. The noodles were cooked well as was the poached egg. Soup was flavorful and came with good slices of pork. Service was nice and friendly. There is free wifi which is always a plus!Decent place to get your ramen fix - prices are ok for the city - about \u00a340 for a meal for 2",

    "text": "One of the better ramen places I've been to in the world, I stumbled upon it accidentally while returning some keys to a friend - proof that there's a silver lining in everything.The first thing you should know is that this place gets very busy, so you might need to wait a bit. The second thing is that the waiters are going to explain the entire menu to you if you say you've never been there before, down to every last detail. It's kind of patronizing.I love spicy ramen and will almost always pick it over the others. Their menu lists a traditional tonkatsu, but then it also lists a Kotteri Hakata Tonkatsu ramen that has a richer and thicker sauce. There was an unnecessary amount of confusion when I asked if the spicy Piri Piri Tonkatsu was made with the traditional tonkatsu, or the Kotteri - the waitress explained to me what tonkatsu was three times in a row. So I just ordered it.If you like spicy ramen, the Piri Piri is the way to go. The broth was smooth and silky and had just enough heat to make your forehead sweat a little, but not enough to burn your tastebuds into oblivion. The noodles were perfect, smooth and not overdone. I didn't like that they added raw jalapeno and ginger though. The ginger kind of threw off the rest of the flavor and I avoided the jalapeno because I didn't want my mouth to catch on fire.If you're in London and have a ramen craving then this is your place. Just be prepared to wait and/or be spoken to as if you were a child.",

A thick pancake with cucumber and hoisin sauce with a nice big piece of fried chicken in it. Next we both had a ramen dish, I had the recommended Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu -- which was a nice filling dish. We also had the Karaka Tan Tan Tonkotsu, which was similar to my dish but spicy -- it was really good. If you like spicy food I'd chose this dish over the other one. A nice meal out, about \u00a312 for a bowl of ramen. Not to bad of prices, seen though it's right down the street from Piccadilly Circus. Easy walk to and from the tube.",

    "text": "Having been spoiled silly this year with highly anticipated trips to both Ippudo (yelp.com/biz/ippudo-ny-n\u2026) and Momofuku (yelp.com/biz/momofuku-no\u2026) over in New York city, I was thrilled to see what the city of London had to offer in terms of pork buns and ramen. Behold: Shoryu. The verdict? Better than Momofuku Noodle Bar, but just shy of Ippudo.Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?One thing I will say regarding the atmosphere is that Shoryu does an excellent job of walking the fine line between authentic and fusion. Many of the staff are clearly japanese, but the atmosphere is such that you'll be comfortable even if you're a local or a non-Japanese tourist. Seating is both varied and abundant, so you'll be good whether you're a larger party of just an individual like I was. While the ramen can take a bit of time to come out, know that's because it's made to order, and in the meantime you can dig into a pork bun, which you absolutely should. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Prices here at Shoryu are comparable to what you'll find elsewhere, with everything inflated just a bit to adjust for currency. Ramen? Twelve pounds. A pork bun? Just shy of a fiver. Considering that these portions are sizable, these are fair prices across the board. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?I went with a mix of traditional and contemporary here at Shoryu, and the result was a classic pork bun and a more modern 'Peri Peri' spicy ramen. I ended up with a bit of a mixed bag, with top notch ramen and a pork bun that was good but not what I would call elite. First? The pork bun. Good? Again, yes, this was a good pork bun, but I was a bit surprised at the simplicity of the auxiliary ingredients. The lettuce was standard iceberg, and while the pork was good, the entire thing was drowned in a chipotle mayo of some source that cleaned out a lot of the flavor. Good, but not the best I've had (that's you Ippudo). Now, the ramen I will say was easily top tier. I have a pretty exceptionally high tolerance for spicy food, so when I was warned that the peri peri ramen was spicy I more or less brushed it off. Wow. A word to the wise? This is some spicy ramen, and when it came down to drinking the broth I had to stop shy of finishing off the whole thing on account of my throat burning with jalapeno seeds. Having said that, the chicken and seaweed and egg and noodles were phenomenal, and this was pretty close to being on par with the best ramen I've had over at Ippudo. \u00a0Excellent. Single Star Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?While it's not the best ramen and pork bun combo I've ever had, for now Shoryu is the best I've found in the city, and that warrants a fourth star overall. Star Granted.",

This was my first real ramen house experience, so I got the tonkotsu regular - it was flavorful with an egg, veggies but only about three slices of pork. I had a taste of the spicy tonkotsu broth, and it's a little more flavorful only if you can handle the heat!! We also didn't have to wait very long for the soup to come, which was convenient. The ambiance is charming and modern, and the servers were attentive, but since this restaurant is quite small and pretty busy, we decided against overstaying our welcome. Recommended if you're near Piccadilly Circus.",

The service and location are exceptional, albeit a very touristy location. Obviously, I gravitated towards this location because all tourists get sucked into the \"tourist epicenter\" of any city. The food is good but not great (meat quality in the buns is not good) and definitely not worth the price. I understand rent is very expensive in this area and the high costs definitely pass down to the food. However, I was still disappointed with the quality of food based on the price. After paying for the meal, I thought about selling my semen to a sperm bank to help offset the cost of this meal. I eventually decided not to do it because I didn't want my biological kids trying to find me 30 years later during their \"finding myself stage\" to figure out what genetic similarities we shared. At the end of the day, I thought about semen for money for ramen. End of story. End of review. I didn't do it. I'm out.",

The sous vide egg was pretty good. But I'd have to give it to Shoryu for having the best broth compared to Bone Daddies and Kanada-Ya. The broth was spicy, thick, and flavorful. Same goes for the noodles, the best compared to Bone Daddies and Kanada-Ya. I still much prefer thick ramen noodles though. It seems to me that thick ramen noodles are nonexistent in London.

Its run by the same people as the Japan Centre across the road. If the Japanese shop there, they'll probably be eating here, so you won't be disappointed.We ordered the Shoryu Tonkotsu and the Piri Piri Tonkotsu (which had just the right spicy kick). Both had pickled white ginger in it ...great for sushi, but too over-powering for soup noodles. It was shoved out the bowl and piled high on the complementary pickled red cabbage starter dish. We accompanied our meal with a side order of soft shell crab instead of the more traditional gyoza.On our waiter's recommendation, we finished the meal with the sponge cake (not on the menu). It was light and filled with fresh cream, and topped off with a macha sprinkling.Overall, a great eating experience for pre-movies or pre-theatre dining. I'd give it 5-stars, but that's reserved for Daikokuya in LA's Japan Town.yelp.co.uk/biz/daikokuya\u2026",

Table was quite oily and sticky. the stuff that I taking up from the table keep sticking on table which make me think about the hygiene of this consider still new ramen shop.2. Our sushi didn't come after 20min...... Ask for a waiter to check if they did place the order if they didn't then is ok we ready to pay. He went to check n come back telling us ok Cancelled now!! -_-!!Okay....... 2013Have been looking for an authentic japanese ramen shop for quite some time. Heard bout this restaurant for quite some time and finally we get to try it.When there around 8pm on a weekday with my friend. No queue. Got seated once we were there. Their table and chair seems to be slightly lower. The chair is like those low bar chair kind.......Not comfortable type. Clearly they do not want their customer to be too comfortable and stay too long in their restaurant.The day we went we they were giving out free sake for customer. I ordered their house special bone soup roast pork ramen (I think it call tongkotsu). It was yummy. I like it. \u00a0We also order 2 sides fried chicken and the green bean edamame. They serve the bean with brown colour rock salt which make it look special. They do give a free side which is vinegar cabbage.Would give a 4 stars if they have more spacious space and comfy seating for \u00a0what the price they are charging their customer.",

I had my noodles cooked normally and the ramen came topped with pork belly, mushroom and green onion. That was actually perfect because I wouldn't eat the egg anyway. The noodles here are the thinner kind, not the chewy thick ones (I prefer the thicker noodles). The bowl was kind of small. Normally, when I eat ramen, I get a bigger bowl with more soup. The soup was good, but nothing mind-blowing, especially when they advertised their soup to be 12 hour soup.The service was quick and efficient. I really liked how if you asked for tap water, they gave you a whole bottle, even though I was only 1 person. \u00a0Overall, the ramen was good. I don't have a lot of experience eating ramen in London, but I do have a ton of experience eating ramen in SF and this was ok compared to the kinds I've had in SF.",

    "text": "Went to London on holiday came here, and now I'm depressed that I'm back home in Cardiff instead of being able to eat here every day.Honestly - if I lived in London and could afford to do so, I would eat here EVERY DAY. NO. JOKE. I'm STILL thinking about those perfectly seasoned eggs. No wonder they're on the Michelin recommended list two years in a row!~ Atmosphere:Cute atmosphere - nothing fancy. The wall has a great description of the parts of ramen, if you're new to this amazing dish you can read up on it! Even though I'm a ramen fanatic, I still learners a bit about the ramen styles of different regions in Japan.~ Customer Service:Really lovely. The waitress who served us was very sweet and friendly, and our food came out at a decent time (not alarmingly quick like they do in Japan, but still at a relatively decent time). They also provide fresh garlic you can crush right into your ramen if you're a garlic fanatic like me.~ Food:This where the 5 stars comes from. Everything else could be literally GARBAGE and I would still give this place 5 stars. We ordered Pork Belly Buns to start off with and they were fantastic. I'll be honest - I've had better baos elsewhere so next time I come I'll probably skip on the baos and go straight to the ramen just to get a better taste value for money.I ordered the Dracula Ramen (garlic tonkotsu ramen) and it was out of this world. You can order extra toppings so I opted for an extra seasoned egg. After I finished my first plate of eggs I wish I had no shame and order an extra plate. You're also allowed to ask for extra noodles or meat - all at a price of course but I'm definitely glad they had that option available.Choose the firmness of your noodles and you're ready to go - the result? The most AMAZING ramen. The depth of flavour of my ramen was immense and you can definitely bet that I slurped up all the remaining broth after I was done. If you're a ramen snob and here to compare Shoryu to the other ramen powerhouses of the world, I would say that the broth is what sets this place apart. The char siu was forgettable, but the broth and eggs were UNFORGETTABLE. I'll be thinking about this ramen for years to come.---Do yourself a favour and get to Shoryu Ramen. Probably the best in London.",

I went for the double tonkatsu broth and had a side of the black sesame tofu as a starter. The tofu was inter sting and a very instagrammable dish but not a must order. Tasted like a black sesame jello as it needed a little more sauce/wetness to it. The ramen itself was very solid. Large portion and tons of noodles. Noodles are hard and perhaps the best I've ever had. The fact that you can pick your thickness is awesome to me and really gives each ramen dish it's own rather than churned out in a factory. Chasu was thick but I wouldn't necessarily call it pork belly as mine had virtually no fat. Broth was thick and meaty, but lacked spice. Even with the piri piri side sauce I was still hoping for more. The ramen did not disappoint and it's no surprise they've expanded throughout the city. Biggest complaint was that they charged for still water when all I want d was tap. An upsell like that hurts and seems very seedy. But food wise, one of the better ramens I've had.",

We found Shoryu Ramen via Yelp and immediately looked for the closest red double decker bus to take us there. Even though ramen is not the first thing you think of in terms of British cuisine, we were happily surprised to find the food worthy in the name of Japanese ramen. BF found it better than some of the ramen places in Los Angeles, and that's saying something! We ordered two bowls of the tonkotsu ramen (which includes char siu barbecue pork belly, nitamago egg, mushrooms, spring onion, sesame, ginger, and nori seaweed) and the recommended shoryu buns (2 for \u00a37.50). We loved the ramen more than the buns and a bowl of ramen will do more than enough to keep you full. Sit by the window for people watching!",

There, you wait to be seated, order at the table, and pay at your table.2. Price - Prices may vary depending on what you order. But regarding on Ramen dishes only, it can be from 11 to 15 pounds. 3. Ambiance - Awesome decoration. Looks fitting and petit.4. Food - My wife and I both had the Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu. This is their signature ramen noodle soup. We thought it was flavorful and very filling. It is prepared in Pork broth, Char Siu BBQ Pork, Nitamago Egg, Kikurage Mushrooms, Spring Onion, Sesame, Ginger, Nori Seaweed, and fried shallots. 5. Cleanliness - Food and tables were clean, but toilet didn't flush so nicely that night I was there.",

I'd try the hardest one next time. The noodles are thin and not too starchy, so the consistency worked well. The garlic broth was intense in a great way. I do wish they included corn as a topping. My husband ordered a \"frozen beer\" which was a fun gimmick. The place should write down orders though because they initially brought us the entirely wrong flavor for one of our bowls and had to go remake it. Then they just never delivered the appetizer we ordered. Kinda amateur service issues.",

There was also some mayonnaise used in the pork bun, which to me, was a bad idea to a cuisine like this. When it was served, the bun was a little cold, indicating that it was not freshly steamed. On the other hand, the broth to the ramen was just nice! Perfect! And I like how we get to choose the tenderness of the noodle. Overall, the ramen is good, and the ambience is perfect since the server tries to use Japanese but I would avoid the pork bun.",

This was despite asking various servers multiple times to place an order and always being deferred. The place was almost full but not really busy so the poor service was pretty inexcusable.After eating (tasty food), our bill had major issues twice (once it was just unrelated; the second time it had a number of extra items). Finally, a manager had to help correct the bill. We had to ask twice for the service charge to be removed.",

    "text": "Heatwave in London. Warmest summer ever and what better than a super hot face melting bowl of Ramen! \u00a0Gambate! Itadakimaaaas!I peeked over the door noren and I see this place is packed already. I guess I wasn't the only one mad in the brain to eat hot ramen on a hot day. Anyhoo.. I held up 4 fingers and the hostess seemed to know I meant .. table for 4. \u00a0So she led me to the tiniest of tables, crammed next to 2 of the tiniest of tables, and with a quick Hai Dozo.. I was left there. \u00a0But,... but.... I cannot possible traverse the tiny space between the tables to get my seat on the inside. \u00a0I mean.. people were already eating , and their bowls of ramen was perched on their tables, and I would most def, either knock their table over... or even worst.. go past the tables sideways and put my butt right over their table.. So I gave the hostess a helpless look.. ehh...sumimasen... but she looks away. \u00a0Fine.. be like that.. so I proceed to wedge myself between table and takes seat.. So uncool. Tho my wife rolled her eyes at me. \u00a0I needed ramen, I needed something to restore my center. \u00a0The walking and sightseeing and meal decisions while visiting London has been exhausting. \u00a0I needed ramen to get back to basic. \u00a0We got us, Dracula Ramen, Regular Tonkotsu, I think there was Spicy Miso too. \u00a0tldr;- None was spectacular. It wasn't bad. \u00a0But it lacked an identity. \u00a0The noodles was text book, the broth standard, the chashu pedestrian, the toppings bleh. \u00a0In a sea of ramen.. Shoryu ramen did not stand out one bit. \u00a0Service was so-so. \u00a0I don't expect it at a Ramen-ya anyway. \u00a0So I was fine with bare minimum. \u00a0I don't know if there is better Ramen in London. \u00a0This isn't bad, but I would search harder the next time for something better.",

    "text": "After a cold day walking around London, the idea of a hot bowl of noodles sounded great. There was a bit of a line to get in so that was a good sign. Turns out this is a chain. To some, that's off putting or inauthentic. But when done in a respectful way - and tasty way, who cares? When you finally get called for saying they hit a drum and yell something that's supposed to be in Japanese. Cute and sets the Japanese motif. I like that you are able to request noodle doneness for the ramen. In general, I found the ramen (we tried two different ones) to be a little bland but otherwise really good. It had the nice soft boiled egg (but with a slightly reddish yolk). The BBQ pork bao was pretty delicious with a substantial piece of meat. The Soho platter was a pretty posh sampler of food including sashimi, tempura, and Kara age chicken for two. They even had a near-frozen Asahi beer that really hit the spot against the fatty broth of the ramen. We skipped the cocktails but they looked really delicious.We skipped dessert but overall, it was a pretty good meal and surprisingly inexpensive vs. expectations. Would definitely recommend this place for ramen cravings!",

    "text": "It was our last night in London....and knowing that we had a long night ahead of reluctantly packing to head back in Atlanta....Hubby and I opted to stop by here for a simple warm dinner, and romantic walk under the Christmas lights on Regent street. Shoryu came highly recommended by friends and yelpers. It was a cold night so a warm bowl of ramen seemed like a perfect option. We hopped in a uber and arrived with no reservations made prior. Luckily, it was not too busy despite being a Friday night. We were able to find cozy two seats at the front right corner so we could people watch (very fun on a Friday night). I love the detail of purse hooks under the table. They offer specials such as seasonal set menu, Bun Monday, and Happy Sake hour. Shoryu Ramen started in Nov. 2012 and recommend in the Michelin Guide since 2014 (you still see the sticker at the entrance). They specialize in Hakata Tonkotsu ramen (aka, rich-thick- white pork broth with straight ramen noodles). Ricky and I both ordered the same Shoryu tonkatsu ramen ....and the broth was amazing! You can tell it has been cooking for many hours with great quality ingredients. And do not forget about the noodles made from fresh Shoryu flour! Fresh, bouncy, and chewy. You can request different textures to your liking. The ramen comes with the traditional toppings of a soft boiled egg, pork, and veggies,and nori. All the toppings were excellent as well.....but I am a BIG soup and noodles person so those are the items that grabbed by attention the most. The gyoza is supposed to be really good here but unfortunately no one told me -_-. I didn't find this out till after I left the restaurant. The uber driver asked me if I got the dumplings on the ride back to the hotel. We got the takoyaki instead which was so-so. Another popular item is the HIrata Bun. Hubby got the wagyu beef filled bun. They names it the Shoryu bun to bring prosperity to you when you eat it :) Very cute. This location also has quiet an extensive alcohol selection. Def check this out. There was a reason everyone inside was drinking lol. Highly recommend. Great place for ramen.",

Finally got the attention of our waitress (the only one serving the whole place), to ask a question about a discount we had. She gave us an explanation then walked away for another several minutes when we had to flag her down for the bill. Again, staff seated to our left acted oblivious. I don't know how they run a business here.Food: Very tasty, full of flavour and good portion size. I enjoyed my Dracula tonkatsu ramen. It was hearty and delicious. Verdict: I would return to another place gladly, given this poor service doesn't extend to all their locations. Clearly they have good food, they just need to work on hiring good people.",

Along with our respective bowls of ramen (one Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu, one Dracula Tonkotsu), we also ordered a couple of the Shoryu buns.Personally I wasn't a huge fan of the buns as they actually had quite a bit of mayo on them. They were still tasty but I would probably pass on them on any subsequent visit.The ramen was quite good and you have the choice of how you would like your noodles prepared. The broth of the Hakata Tonkotsu was flavorful, savory, and rich. The double nitamago egg was eggsellent. The Dracula Tonkotsu is filled with tasty garlic bits and flavour but may require an after-meal mint. 3.5 stars overall.",

We stopped by shoryu, which was decently busy on a weekday late afternoon. We were asked to wait outside for a few minutes as they were cleaning the tables. I got the dracula tonkotsu and my fiance ordered the tonkotsu with the more intense/ thicker broth. We both enjoyed our meal - you can order the noodles cooked to your preferred doneness (standard, firm, etc.) and the egg that came with the noodles was cooked perfectly. My soup base was a little too garlicky for my tastes, but that was my fault since the description clearly detailed that it was for garlic lovers. My fiance said this was probably one of the better ramen places he's eaten at (and we've been to plenty in Chicago and NY)The meal was a little pricey for what it was, but we were in the heart of London so I expect part of it was due to location so can't really complain there.",

We were in town for less than a week, and naturally we wanted to try out as many restaurants as possible, but we ended up eating here twice because it was so good.The wait was quite long for dinner, but we were able to be seated immediately for lunch. It's a small, packed space and you will most likely be seated at a table connected to another party.I got the curry ramen both times. It was unique, flavorful, and the perfect portion. The only suggestion I have is to put the karaage chicken on the side, so as not to have them turn soggy. \u00a0Additionally, the lychee strawberry drink was amazing, but maybe not worth \u00a36.",

    "text": "I've now had the chance to return to Shoryu to try more of their menu. In fact, their ever burgeoning menu. I'm impressed quickly they've added dishes to their menu, both in the ramen and the starter/side dishes categoriesThey've also tweaked service slightly. You still get the cheerful Japanese greeting but they've done away with the drum they hit with each new customerThey've expanded their ramen menu with both traditional and innovative combinations. I want to love their ramen but can only bring myself to like it. At the risk of sounding ungrateful, I think they put too much in their bowl. I like ramen because I like to taste the ramen noodles but the noodles get lost with all the other parapernalia they put into the bowlThey've also greatly expanded their starter/side dish menu. I have to give a shout out to their belly pork hirata buns. These are made up with 2 steamed buns which are quite dense but the perfect foil to the sweet soft pork which they sandwich. I had discovered these at Ippudo in New York and am so glad that I've found somewhere in London which does themIf you want a range of dishes, go to Shoryu for their range. However, if you want the best bowl ramen, I'd still recommend Bone Daddies",

    "text": "Me and some friends took advantage of the massive discounts Shoryu was offering and payed the new shop in Piccadilly a visit. \u00a0 I gotta say in advance that my opinion about the place was not very positive for a good part of the evening but then built up and ended on a good note. \u00a0When we first arrived, we were left outside on a queue waiting to get in with no indication of whether it would take 10 minutes or 1 hour. Not a big deal, but doesn't get anyone any points either. When we finally got a table, we had to wait quite a while to get a menu (which only arrived after us chasing the waiter). 10 minutes later, 2 more people were squeezed in into our table - clearly a management attempt to fit in as many people as possible. \u00a0It is fair to say that there wasn't much space left in the table, but that didn't matter as far as the drinks were concerned: 3\u00a3 for the smallest orange juice I've ever seen in my life. \u00a0Those were the not so good points... but then a storm of flavor arrived and washed that all away. \u00a0The starters are really really good, specially the Hirata Buns - the pork ones are spicy but terrific. We also had Soft Shell Crab Tempura which were more than enough for 4 people. \u00a0The main Ramen dishes completely met our expectations: flavorful, big portions, good balance between the ingredients. We struggled to finish them after all those starters so it's worth building up your appetite before visiting the place! I had the Tori Kara-Age Men and was quite happy with it - only negative was the size of the fish cake portion: way too small. \u00a0 We also ordered an extra cold Ramen to try it out. Unfortunately, the waiter brought us the wrong one, so not sure which one it was. Overall the service was a bit all over the place and not that well organized, but the staff was friendly and approachable. Can't really give this one a 5 but the food was good enough to stir away from a 3.",

(Which is incredible!)Ramen:Any place with tonkotsu broth, I'm going to invariably compare to ippudo. The broth was good to be sure but just not as flavourful as I'd like. It lacks a certain intensity you find in other places.Noodles here are pretty nice. Again, not big on flavour but they have a wonderful texture. Definitely Shoryu's USP.Sides:Had gyozas, chicken karaage, and pork buns. All were extremely enjoyable. Pork buns are a must order. Overall:I'd give the ramen 3.5 stars objectively. In Singapore or New York, I'd say this is an average ramen place. It's a safe choice, enjoyable, but really nothing special. In London though, those same factors mean it's effectively 5 stars. If you're craving ramen, you'll be satisfied.",

    "text": "I queued in the snow for nearly an hour... just to eat this ramen.(And gyoza and onigiri)AND IT RULED.After we finally got in, we got lucky and secured the only 2 seater table in the place. We were right against the window and had to turn our knees outward as they didn't fit under the table, and I had a fire extinguisher sticking out from the wall behind me. It's definitely a squash in here when it's full so be warned. But unlike Bone Daddies your lack of space doesn't come with uncomfortably loud music and petty portion sizes. So it's even more worth it.We ordered some drinks and a portion of gyoza. They came pretty quickly and were awesome. The gyoza skins were nicely crispy and the perfect thickness.Then our ramens arrived. I had the Charsui Tonkotsu for \u00a310 a bowl - which is kind of expensive, but the portion is really generous and it's so good - again this beat Bone Daddies offering. There was lots of broth (GOOD) and the perfect amount of noodles and meat and lots of toppings. The broth was the perfect texture, it had that tonkotsu thickness but wasn't too fatty and greasy. My husband went for the Dracula Tonkotsu, which he loved. It was essentially the richer, garlicy-er version of the normal Tonkotsu and was a dream come true. We asked for vinegar and shichimi powder. They brought a huge metal jug of vinegar and a cute wooden container of shichimi, the waiter was quite funny about the size of the vinegar and the vinegar was really, really good. I love vinegar in my ramen so finding a place that offers it on-menu is a huge plus.When we saw the specials board we couldn't help ordering a couple of onigiri. They were meant to come with brown rice but as they were running out they asked if we'd mind one with white rice. They were so apologetic and said if we didn't like it with white rice we could have one with brown for free! But for me this was even better as I prefer white rice. They were filled with pickles and really delicious.The onigiri filled us up quite a lot and when we couldn't finish the ramen, we were so happy to find they'd bag everything up in a takeaway bag for us to take home.The service was good, with one minor slip up when a different waiter tried to deliver a second plate of dumplings to us and didn't apologise for the mistake, aside from that it was pretty perfect.I love the food here. If it wasn't for the cramped space (sorry, I know it's ramen bar style but I'm still getting used to these packed-in restaurants!) and the fact we had to queue for so long it'd be a 5 star straight away!",

    "text": "I tried the Karaka TanTan Tonkotsu Ramen which were garlicky spicy noodles with minced pork on top. \u00a0My egg was a bit overcooked, I do like the yolk soft and runny. \u00a0My Tantan noodles were on the saltier side. \u00a0The only thing that annoyed me was that all the minced pork sunk to the bottom of the bowl, and I spent most of my time trying to fish it out. I think I'm gonna stick with basic Tonkotsu noodles, where I actually get slices of pork. \u00a0To share, we had the Chicken Karaage - same as last time, nicely fried! \u00a0We also ordered Gyoza, but for 5, I felt it was quite understuffed and small. \u00a0The wrapping was a bit on the hard side. \u00a0The pork filling was good, nothing wrong with that. \u00a0But I think for the value, I'll stick with just the karaage. My friend ordered the Charsiu Tonkotsu - which is pretty much your classic noodles but with extra pork. \u00a0I tasted the broth, and strangely enough, it was... on the sweeter side. \u00a0I thought it was just me, but he tasted it too and thought it was definitely sweet. \u00a0Anyway, still a nice place to go to, but I think my go-to place is Bone Daddies for now.",

    "text": "So yummy. Much Umami. Goooood!Quick lunch in trafalgar square and around? planning for some ramen but you already tried sasuke (which is better!)? Definitely come here. Especially if you are alone.The place is not that big with many small tables and a counter running all over the window. No-nonsense chart, solid ramens, some buns and just a couple of other dishes. But you definitely wanna get the ramen.Take the one you prefer, I usually go for the standard one when I want to try a new place (first you show me you can cook a steak, then you can make a filetto alla rossini!), and just stare at the broth: Brown, thick, if I didn't knew it was liquid I'd have said it was a cream! Definitely something special, you can feel that it will be delicious just by looking at it! That my friends is probably the best broth I ever had in my ramen. The egg follows the same description, just absolutely amazing, cooked at the perfection, and overall a real pleasure.The only thing missing, and the reason why it stands below Sasuke in my personal RAMENED competition (Ramen Axelrod May Eat Night & Day) is regarding the thickness of the noodles, which I found a bit too thin for my personal palate. But that's just me being an annoying stickler.Just come here and enjoy the delicious broth!",

    "text": "I've been to Shoryu now twice, once during their soft opening and once afterwards. This place specializes in a a different sort of white soup ramen from a particular region in Japan. Compared to places like Bone Daddies, this is more of an authentic Japanese-style ramen place (but that's not to say that authenticity=better). Service: When I went during the soft opening, they were definitely still working out the kinks. They have one waitress in particular who we've named 'waitress happy pants' because of her... rather surly demeanor. Quite frankly, I don't know if she was just having a horrible day or what, but I am very forgiving when it comes to bad service, but less so when they are snappy and eye-rolly and seem like they hate their job and everything is the customer's fault (even when it isn't). At any rate, she was actually more hilarious than frustrating, so whatever. Food: High soup to noodle content, the soup is flavorful but not quite rich enough for my personal tastes, some nice goodies in the bowl, but not quite enough of them. The ramen noodles themselves were the best thing about this bowl, really good. The first time I got the Shoryu Ramen, which was nice. The second time I had the Tokyo Ramen, which was soy sauce based broth with fish cake and bamboo. I think I prefer the Shoryu because it was one of the specialty white broths. Do order the egg, as they are well seasoned and quite nice (though it is a shame they don't come automatically with a bowl like they do at Tonkotsu and Bone Daddies). My dining partner had the yuzu ramen, which was really tasty. When I come back, I want to try to spicy miso and the yuzu ones. That said, and this is just personal preference, I found the overall dining experience and food at Bone Daddies to be more satisfying, but it is actually quite hard to compare the two as they are totally different ramen beasts. I'll certainly be back to Shoryu as well, when I want a soupier/less heavy noodle experience.",

    "text": "I recently visited a little gem I frequent on Regent Street, London named Shoryu Ramen. Since its opening in November 2012 they have been offering their Hakata Tonkotsu ramen, a recipe which was specially designed by executive chef, Kanji Furukawa. Shoryu translates to mean 'to bring good fortune'.I find Shoryu to be an understated, modest establishment, however its popularity speaks for itself. You cannot reserve a table ahead of time and frequently I spot a line that reaches way outside into the busy streets of Soho. A ringing endorsement in itself and an indication of quality before you even enter the front door!Their menu is refreshingly simple - as their name suggests, they mainly offer steaming bowls of ramen, amongst other small plates and of course, steamed buns!I HAD to try their steamed buns as this delicious creation is one of my latest favourites. For those yet to discover these beauties, a steamed bun - as the name suggests, consists of a variety of fillings, encased in a pillowy, fluffy steamed-dough bunI opted to try two different variations, the Char Sui barbecue pork belly (left) and the soy marinated chicken Karaage (right). Now I'm never short of an opinion, but I REFUSE to pick a favourite, they are both unbelievably spot-on. The pork belly was packed with flavour and smothered in charred-sweet sauce, which married well with the crunch of the salad and the softness of the bun, whilst the contrast of the crispiness of the chicken against the cloud-soft bun was to die for!You just simply have to try these, plus they offer more variations on their menu, namely; their ginger salmon Tatsutage, their tiger prawn Tempura, and their vegetarian-friendly, grilled Halloumi & Shimeji mushrooms.Quite honestly, after those two delicious helpings of steamed buns - I really couldn't imagine tackling their rich, generous serving of Ramen - I had to give myself a break! But I finally opted for their Kotteri Hakata Tonkotsu - their signature 12-hour ramen, but with a richer, meatier broth. I loved this dish, it has variety, balance and is the exact antidote to a hectic day, rushing around London. This steaming bowl of warmth allows you to take a much-needed pause.Ok, I will admit that I had to take half of this serving home to enjoy, however I'd argue that after the flavours were able to muddle for even longer it made for an even more delicious serving. Don't be ashamed to take your ramen on the tube home!Shoryu Ramen isn't the least expensive establishment you can visit, but its comforting simplicity, packed with flavour keeps me coming back. A would definitely recommend this to anyone who is an Asian-food lover. Or to anyone who has yet to try their first bowl of Ramen or steamed-bun - this is a great place to start!...And a tip to any Ramen-lover on a budget - you can take a ramen, steamed-bun and a drink to go for just \u00a312 with their go PACKAGE. I've only ever visited their Regent St. location, but why not visit their other restaurants located in Soho, Carnaby and Liverpool Street? Does anyone have a preference? Let me know!Happy Slurping!See the original blog here: laurajreeves.com/2015/05\u2026",

    "text": "Chose to eat an early dinner at Shoryu as it was a short walk from my hotel. Their menu seems extensive given the number of pages. I chose to start with a Pork Char Siu Bun to start. The Pork Char Siu came in a fluffy bun with sliced cucumber, lettuce and mayo. I liked it, but wish it had a couple of slices of pork. They have several versions of Tonkotsu Ramen. I chose the Piri Piri which is their spicy version. All the ramen come with the sliced pork, half a soft boiled egg, mushrooms, seaweed, roasted garlic and thin noodle egg ramen. The broth was rich and thick, but to my surprise not very spicy at all. I kind of wanted more heat, so a little disappointed. I didn't see the red pepper anywhere either. But they do have the fresh garlic in a bucket with the crusher, if you choose to want to squeeze some into your ramen, which I did. I did like their noodles as it was thin and chewy. The service was good. And they leave a whole bottle of tap water for you which I thought was convenient. For my ramen and pork bun, it was \u00a318.45 which included what they called a \"12.5 optional service charge\". That's strange to me as its already in the total. \u00a0Does that mean that I could have left \u00a316.40 and they would have been ok with it?",

The menu was massive and it seemed like you can order almost all kinds of noodle-joy. I tried the Sapporo Miso, and my other half tried the wasabi tonkotsu.

I liked the broth, and even though it's kind of odd to have bean sprouts as a topping, it was a nice addition for me (haven't been eating my veggies since I came to London... or wait since I moved out of my parent's house). The noodle is a bit hard, but still pretty good. Green tea was served with a cute little tea pot, nice containers can always make things taste better ;).Didn't like the mini salad too much. It's a bit too salty, I wish I got gyoza as a side instead. What I love the most about this place is that it's not awkward to eat alone at all. I sat \u00a0on a communal table and there were 5 or 6 people eating by themselves (most are Japanese). It makes my aloneness doesn't seem as sad. \u00a0The staff were friendly and efficient, even though none of them are Japanese they tried to greet everyone with Japanese. Besides food and service, the location is great (super close to Piccadily circus) , and the decor is minimal/clean, just the way I like it. \u00a0For someone who isn't a ramen geek, I totally enjoyed the experience.",

I got the original Ramen Tonkotsu, which I didn't think had any depth of flavour. Pork belly also far too fatty for my liking.I'm willing to come back one day but it did put me off considering I could easily compare it to it's rivals in Soho.",

Some times there is a tiny bit more bun than filling and they can put a .5 gram of too much mayo on it - that's all I'll concede.Add to that its reasonably priced and the service is fantastic and I will come back here again and again. The only downside is that the quality is quite good so one can then eat a lot - one time I both ate a lot and took down some beer. Its hard to go back to work after that - you kind of want to go have an afternoon nap.Really cannot over recommend this place.",

Came to london for a vacation, mid week through our trip of course I start to crave asian food and whats better than a hot bowl of ramen?Shoryu specializes in tonkotsu soup base which is my favorite. \u00a0They have different option for the thickness of the broth. \u00a0If you are used to eating ramen def go with the rich broth option as their regular broth was a little on the bland side. \u00a0I love the egg as its the perfect yolk consistency. \u00a0Service was pretty good also, very fast and attentive. \u00a0While the noodles are pretty good here, it is hard to stomach the fact that I spent almost $100 US dollars here for 2 bowls of ramen, 6pc gyoza and an icecream dessert. \u00a0It cost like $30 for a bowl of ramen and $5 to add just an egg...if you are a local then definitely check out this place as their ramen is pretty good but if you are travelling from NY i would say to skip it and save the $.",

    "text": "I rarely give five stars for ramen because I enjoy a particular style and that is tonkotsu broth and not many places do it well.I walked into Shoryu for lunch solo on a weekday afternoon and didn't have to wait for a seat. The place was pretty packed for lunch.I got a Dracula ramen which is tonkotsu with garlic. Garlic oil, garlic chips, fresh minced garlic, which as one can imagine, gets a pretty strong flavor. Let's just say I wasn't kissing anyone for the whole day or even opening my mouth because I could've killed someone with my breath. Was it worth it? You bet.The broth was rich and flavorful and the flavors melded together for a heavenly experience. The ramen came with half an egg perfectly done and three slices of fatty chashu. What I REALLY enjoyed was that there was some ginger in the broth, which really contrasted well with the garlic. Anyone can throw garlic inside tonkotsu but not everyone can layer flavors like a Korean girl layers clothes. My only grouse is that there was half an egg. Just give me the whole damned egg already. Thank you.I haven't written my Bone Daddies review yet but tldr;I would choose Shoryu over Bone Daddies. I have noticed a distinct difference in the crowds at both places. Shoryu has a more Asian crowd and Bone Daddies seems to have a hipster crowd. Different strokes for different folks.",

    "text": "I am a big fan of ramen and am always up for discovering the best shop around town. There are two Shoryu around Piccadilly Circus, which is a highly touristy area, so I am already a bit suspicious. Though a gong is rung every time a customer comes in or goes out of the shop, it doesn't make the place more Japanese. Maybe most of the servers are not Japanese or the restaurant just doesn't have the coziness which is typical of Japanese ramen places. I went there for lunch, so I just ordered Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu which is their signature ramen. Anybody who is into ramen knows that the broth is what makes or breaks ramen. Their broth is ok flavor-wise, but nothing really jumped out at me. The toppings include pickled ginger, fried shallots and black wood ear in addition to the usual roasted pork and egg. Overall, it was a good bowl of ramen but that's it. Shoryu offers a lot of side dishes ranging from sashimi, pork buns to chicken wings, which are not food you would see served at an authentic ramen shop. Call me all fashioned, a good ramen place to me should have just a few options of ramen and limited number of side dishes. Shoryu seems to be a Japanese restaurant that caters mostly to tourists and serves all sorts of Japanese dishes, one of which happens to be \u00a0Ramen. If you are looking for great ramen place, I wouldn't recommend it, but if you want some decent Japanese food in the area, this is not a bad choice.",

While studying abroad I was really missing a dose of Asian food and had heard such good things and was so impressed with Shoryu! I think it's the best ramen I've had yet. Now that I'm back in the States, I find myself craving Shoryu all the time. I've had the original once in Carnaby, the signature ramen twice and the Dracula once on Regent St. All were so good! The broth is amazing and the egg. Ugh, the egg. Perfect. Just how it should be done! Having gone a few times, I found it not filling enough, so I recommend rationing your broth so you can get extra noodles if you're still hungry!The plum wine is also great. A really nice complement to the savoury noodles. I didn't liked Asian steamed buns growing up but the pork belly hirata buns changed my mind. So good!Next time I'm in London, definitely making a stop at one of my favorite trendy restaurants!!",

Had their signature dish Shoryu Ganso Tonkotsu which is ramen noodles served in a thick rich pork broth and garnished with deep fried shallot, pickled ginger, soft boiled egg, julienned mushroom, and seaweed paper. \u00a0We also tried gyoza, salmon sashimi, and tempura tiger prawns. The service was friendly and prompt and the atmosphere is very comfortable. Our server suggested two cold sake options that were excellent and provided a new experience for myself. The first was Tarusake which had a black pepper finish but still subtle and flavorful. \u00a0The second selection was Nigori cloudy sake which was creamy with real texture.",

Whoever said that food at London sucks should go check this place out.I ordered the pira pira ramen and my friend ordered the kimchi seafood ramen. The broth for both ramen tasted similiar: both spicy, thick and DELICIOUS. The egg was perfectly cooked and the pork was soft and tender. I've tried many japanese ramen places in southern california, shanghai, and seoul, and this place was hands down one of the best.The price was pretty expensive for a bowl of ramen, around 12 pounds. However, in my opinion, the ramen was worth the price and i would definitely come back again.",

I feel as though I was a little too spoiled with my first ramen restaurant experience because I went to one of the top spots in Los Angeles and it was truly incredible. I haven't been able to get the same quality of ramen since but that isn't to say I've been dissatisfied. For a chain, Shoryu is quite good and I went twice during my week in London because I love ramen that much. The ramen is definitely better than some that Ive had before which is a good thing. I tried multiple types and they all had unique tastes to them that made them worthwhile. Some appetizers were tried as well and they had varying degrees of success. The pork belly buns are good but certainly there are better. The brussel spout tempura...uhhhhh not good. Like wow those were pretty bad.The restaurant is also quite small, surprise surprise for a London restaurant and the tables are scrunched together like you can't believe. Surely that made things a little uncomfortable but not until a group of stereotypical 16 year old asian girls with jansport backpacks as if they came straight from a Japanese anime sat right next to us. But until I can afford to rent out every restaurant I go to for the night I will have to cope with my middle class problems.",

They were firm and had a hearty and pleasant chewiness to them. They held up to the powerful broth and abundance of stellar ingredients. It all paired wonderfully with a cold Sapporo.",

I was here with a girlfriend on a Friday evening and while they don't take reservations - we came here around 7:30pm and waited for under 5 mins. The ambience is casual and the service was a bit slow, but the food was delicious. To start we ordered the edamame which was salted and lightly dusted with pepper. And for main course, I ordered the \"white natural\" with gluten free noodles which is served in a soy milk/mushroom \u00a0soup with mushrooms and fried tofu among other things. My ramen was quite delicious especially given that it was vegan and gluten free (a rare find!). My friend ordered the original tonkotsu which is a simple dish with pork belly, mushrooms and spring onions in a pork broth. Of course you can always add extra toppings if your heart desires. Both of us enjoyed our food and I will definitely return to try their buns which they can substitute with gluten free buns!PS: The ramen portion sizes are quite adequate. While this time, I didn't try the desserts - they do offer some cool green tea flavoured desserts.",

The sashimi sampler tasted as if had been sitting out for a while. And the fruit flies that were buzzing around during our meal also didn't help the ambiance... Needless to say, I was expecting more from my meal at Shoryu. And good service from a pleasant and attentive waitstaff could not make up for mediocre food.",

The noodles had an OK mouthfeel (a bit thick and squishy for my taste, which is barely al dente), and the broth we found more salty and oily than we liked. My friend got the ramen with the black sesame oil, and she didn't love it. But overall, knowing what's available ramenya-wise in London, this really wasn't that bad.

They did have that chili oil however, which is what I really love. At the end of the meal we were stuffed!! I think I waddled out of the restaurant.

    "text": "After a trip to Japan, I've been searching for real ramen! Living in Cleveland, OH... the choices were few and far between. Imagine my happiness when I walked by Shoryu on a recent trip to London! The broth was a milky brown, the eggs were perfectly boiled, everything was spot on. I didn't think it was overly expensive (about 15 pounds per bowl) and I loved that they had stronger flavor options for your broth. I've had a lot of ramen disappointments and this was not one of them!",

    "text": "I went along to this extended soft opening to take advantage of the half price extravaganza on ramen goodness (which I wouldn't have known about unless Desi F. was around). There was of course some buzz and a line was naturally out the door, the only place really as it was a small restaurant. Still, the wait was only 15 minutes and then we were there, close enough we could be served the soup and noodle goodness we had been smelling for 15 minutes. The majority of the staff, apart from 1, were very polite and attentive. Also the old guy running the place was Japanese as was many of the patrons so I felt confident in the quality. And that quality didn't disappoint. It was a very generous bowl of ramen noodles with some veg and pork in a cloudy broth. The pork was a tasty BBQ pork and there could have been a little more. However, the main attraction, the ramen noodles, were very nice and on the whole it was a filling and tasty dish. The restaurant isn't small enough to feel intimate but they were fast and played light jazz music and the dichotomy worked really well. I think at full price it's a push (\u00a38 usually) to be good value for money but definitely worth a few visits. Just save the visits till after payday.",

    "text": "I thought it was delicious; had the standard ramen soup with the spicy mustard greens. Perhaps a bit expensive but not for London. Service was great (and is added on the bill). I waited a good fifteen for a seat -- very popular for weekend lunch. I don't think ramen is health food, exactly; pretty rich stuff.",

    "text": "I have been to the place twice and I have to say its really disappointing. Their ramen is bland and nothing special. The broth and noodles are a-ok. The pork is fine, nothing special. You only get half an egg and it is flavourless and borderline hard-boiled. I was really excited when this place opened, but I think my ramen loyalties for London are firmly sitting with Bone Daddies",
