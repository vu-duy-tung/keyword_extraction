    "text": "Wonderful tapas / Spanish restaurant in Charlotte Street. They really go all the way to make it feel Spanish - wooden floors/bars, tiled walls and masses of Spanish country pottery and ceramics in every nook and cranny. It could risk being over the top, but with Spanish staff and most of all great, authentic tapas Navarro's carries it all off with style. We had octopus (delicious), chicken on a skewer (light and tangy), croquetas and (of course) great patatas bravs in a zingy sauce. All washed down with decent, properly prepared sangria. Marvellous. The restaurant is larger than it looks from the outside and, in contrast to many, the basement section is juts as atmospheric and lively as the main room upstairs. Thoroughly recommended for all lovers of things Spanish.",

Lovely place, staff are very personable and helpful with interpreting the dishes and our waitress advised on what might be best when we were stuck. The dishes are delicious and because there is such variety it is quite a thrill to dine there as the food does excite the taste buds. The decor and seating is great, though please note if going there for the first time there is the odd one or two areas where you may need to 'mind the step'. It feels very authentically Spanish and for an hour or two one can feel on holiday in Spain. I can thoroughly recommend it.",

    "text": "LOVE THIS PLACE! I've been now a few times - for team lunches as well as dinner dates with friends and I've found that whether in a group of 7 or 2 - you get a great meal, awesome service, and spot-on wine pairing. \u00a0Ambiance: Walking in, you feel like you are transported out of London and into a classy tapa house in Spain. \u00a0Clearly, a lot of thought was put into the interior, from the tables all the way town to the tiled walls. \u00a0During a recent dinner here I was only hoping the food didn't come out so fast. \u00a0It was hard to resist dipping into everything all at once when the evening could have gone on for hours.Wine - Let the servers know which food you are most looking forward to and you'll be suggested a pairing that is both affordable and delicious. \u00a0On my last dinner outting, we had the Barbera - which was great with the meatballs, calamari and richer dishes.Tapas - There is nothing else to say then they were all SO good. Fish, meat, potatoes - each provides a decent portion for 2-3 to share, and as always with tapas you don't have to be in the mood for just one thing. During my last dinner for two we ordered about 7 all together, which was probably too much but over a bottle of wine we were able to enjoy them over the course of the evening slowly.If in the Goodge Street/Charlotte Street area, don't miss out.",

    "text": "Despite some 3 stars reviews, my fiance & I loved this place.It is not a michelin star restaurant and so it won't produce michelin star food. What it offers are home made tapas. It feels like what your parents would cook.Good size portion and great customer services from the staff. Smiles all around.As others mentioned, it looks empty from the outside but once we stepped in, it was pretty busy. There are seating downstairs and were lucky to have a table on a Saturday night without a reservation.I love the d\u00e9cor... very humble and nothing too fancy. The ambience was nice too and we didn't have to shout across to each other to have a conversation.The menu was pretty small which I thought was a good idea because they would be cooking what they're good at. We ordered 6 tapas between the 2 of us and shared a dessert. We were pretty stuffed and were satisfied with the food.We had the stuff aubergine, patatas bravas, bacalao, calamari, chicken with prawns and corquette with ham. Dessert was churros. All were up to our expectation apart from the calamari. The batter could do with a bit of seasoning.I have been to Iberica and Barrafina on numerous occasions. I love both with a passion and have fallen in love with them. However you cannot compare them to Navarros. They are so different to each other yet I'd recommend to try both out.We will be returning.",

    "text": "I had a nice leisurely dinner at Navarro's with Matt B. and a couple of friends we hadn't seen in a while. \u00a0We walked in right when they opened and were seated on the top floor, with the caveat that we would have to be out by nine for another party. \u00a0I liked the dim, cozy atmosphere of the place - it was ideal for catching up with friends. \u00a0The food ranged from average to great, and we enjoyed two bottles of the tasty, affordable house red. \u00a0Service was decent, with a forgotten dish but no real issues. \u00a0Our waitress was friendly and reasonably helpful.Bread and olive oil cost 95 pence per person. \u00a0I thought this was pretty miserly, but as Matt needs his carbs, he got some. \u00a0It was decent, but no better than the free stuff. \u00a0Our group of four ordered a mix of shared and individual plates ranging from \u00a34.60 to \u00a310.95, and some of which were delicious.My favorite of the bunch was the simplest and cheapest - sardinas a la plancha, or fresh grilled sardines with oil and lemon. \u00a0If you're creeped out by the idea of eating whole animals, avoid this one, as they are whole sardines. \u00a0Delicious, flavorful whole sardines with oily flesh wonderfully seasoned.I also enjoyed the Spanish tortilla, a fluffy omelet made with diced potato, egg, and onion. \u00a0I've had better versions, but it was still tasty. \u00a0The dish I ordered that didn't come was the lentils with chorizo, but I did try the lentils with garbanzos. \u00a0The vegetarian version was inexplicably more expensive, but it was a good dish. \u00a0The stewed lentils and chickpeas were hearty and full of flavor. \u00a0I also liked the bacalao a la rote\u00f1a, a dish of pan-fried cod simmered with onions, peppers, and tomatoes. \u00a0The fish was nice and buttery, as cod tends to be, and I enjoyed the chunky vegetable sauce. \u00a0Another winner were the gambas al ajillo - shelled prawns in a garlic, chilli, and wine sauce. \u00a0The prawns had good texture and they were very spicy, in a good way.The rest of our tapas I found rather mediocre. \u00a0A cheese and charcuterie board, the most expensive item at \u00a310.95, was not very memorable. \u00a0It was a fair selection of meat, with Serrano ham, salchich\u00f3n, and chorizo, but there was only one kind of cheese that went unnamed. \u00a0Nothing stood out. \u00a0Pulpo a la gallega was disappointing. \u00a0This was a dish of Galician style octopus served with sliced potatoes and seasoned with piment\u00f3n, sea salt, and olive oil. \u00a0The flavors were all there, but the octopus itself was a bit slimy and didn't have enough bite. \u00a0Skewers of grilled scallop and chorizo were unappealing. \u00a0The scallop was served with its roe, and the way it was prepared was pretty unappealing. \u00a0The chorizo was good, but the scallop was chewy and looked like it was trailing turds.We shared two desserts and they were both outstanding. \u00a0The crema catalana was a custard flavored with lemon peel, cinnamon, and vanilla, with a caramelized top. \u00a0It tasted like a creme brulee with a lighter middle and a little bit of spice. \u00a0It was delicious. \u00a0The crema de chocolate a la sevillana was a chocolate dessert flavored with freshly grated orange and orange liqueur. \u00a0It was rich and dense but not overwhelming, a chocolate bonanza fit for any adult.I like tapas and Navarro's was a lovely place. \u00a0The food wasn't dazzling, and I've had much better tapas in the States, but I enjoyed my dinner. \u00a0I'd recommend it for a nice, low-key meal, preferably with good company.",

I still keep thinking tinned tuna? How dare they charge me almost \u00a36 for tinned tuna and some iceberg salad? Not impressive at all! The other dish of grilled peppers, where better, but not good - cold, really cold grilled peppers in water instead of sauce... It wasn't impressive either! I know 90's is back in fashion, but I never knew it would include the cuisine...Other tapas was called something like honey lamb, but sadly my imagination got too wild there.. I expected chunks of lamb covered in herbs and honey.. But what landed on our table was more like a magic of school cuisine... There were lentils as well... Maybe I should not mention those...Plus side was grilled goat cheese, raisins and seeds. It was heaven! sweet, sticky, tangy, smooth, distinct soft goat cheese taste. Absolutely mind blowing!

    "text": "Quick glance:+ attentive and friendly staff+ really delicious and fresh tapas+ good selection of tapas for everyone+ good selection of wine at decent prices+ value for money- does not have a bar area for waiting- one table sits right by the doors of ladies & gentsFull review:I went with two friends on a Thursday night. We arrived at the restaurant at about 7pm and it was fully booked. Thankfully for us, there was a table of hurried diners who were keen to leave fairly soon, so the lady behind the counter said she would call us as soon as the table frees up, while we go out for a round of drinks nearby. (The restaurant does not have a bar area).True to her words, she rang about 15 minutes after and it took us awhile to get from the bar but she warmly welcomed us when we returned to the restaurant. This gives you a good idea of their superb service all around the restaurant. The waitresses were also very friendly and attentive. We had two bottles of wine (it was called Navarra and it was pleasant) and six dishes amongst us, with some bread and olive. It was more than enough food and everything was delicious. I would recommend the pulpo (octopus) which was very fresh and the Iberico loin of pork which looked like beef in colour and tasted amazing. The bill (bread and olives, two bottles of wine, 6 tapas dishes, and tips) came out to \u00a330 per head. I highly recommend this restaurant for its authentic taste, warm atmosphere, and good value.",

The women dressed in burning red Flamenco dresses with single blood red rose in their tightly combed dark hair were a classic brand feature of the restaurant.The menu is fabulous and tasty, and the wine selection too good to be true. They have a fabulous decor at the entrance which I like; its not like your walking into the dining section. But this display which works like a reception too is done very cleverly.My friend was happy and so was I at the end of a perfect celebration.",

    "text": "With a subtle Spanish feel, a homely essence and a quaint decor throughout the restaurant, Navarro's can provide a pleasant Spanish dining experience from the centre of London. There is a good number of seating both on the ground and basement levels and the even the toilets have been given a good touch of attention (including a cute pig dispenser in the ladies). The table is set with a small bouquet of beautifully arranged flowers, china personalised to the restaurant and green napkins to give another hint of originality.Unfortunately there are not many options for refreshing cold beverages e.g. no fruit cocktails our fresh juices but there is an extensive wine list. The food menu on the other hand is full of great choices from a 'special tapas menu' to a whole page full of vegetarian options, a page full of seafood tapas and a page full of meat dishes. The food is well presented and humble; not over-the-top in flavour or prices yet is made up of decent ingredients.\u00a0The scallop and chorizo skewers (part of their special tapas range) was of a decent size but the chorizo was a little tough and the scallop a little bland. The Espinacas Con Garbanzos with spinach, chickpeas and croutons is deliciously flavoured, a unique mixture of textures and sumptuously soft. The Pulpo Salteado Con Pure De Papas Alinas has well cooked octopus mixed with spring onion potato puree; a decent filler to the meal. The Brocheta De Cordero Con Patatas A Lo Pobre was probably the best tapas amongst my evening's choice of 4; serving up a well seasoned and cooked long lamb skewer dangling proudly over some fragrant rosemary potatoes with garlic and onions. As for desserts, the Crema Catalana is basically a glorified Creme Brulee and the Churros Con Chocolate were a delight with the churros served hot, delicately crispy and generously sprinkled with sugar plus accompanied with a separate heated chocolate dip.In conclusion, Navarro's achieves in creating a hospitable environment, a subtle Spanish flair and an intriguing and vast food selection. This humble establishment on Charlotte Street is brimming with potential and already delivers many a treat; thus I hope to return for more in due time.",

    "text": "First visit... I was looking for a good spot for Spanish food. I am always a bit skeptical about tapas bar. They usually screw you for a lot of money and bad Spanish jamon iberico. But that one was highly recommended on yelp. And a good friend of mine from Paris was in London for the night. So let s go!When you step a foot in that rather small and cosy restaurant you immediately know you are somewhere in Spain. Traditional and a bit old fashioned atmosphere, all the decoration stuffs I used to see when I spent holidays some time in remote places in Spain. This is very welcoming though!Then a look at menu. It s really hard to make a choice as everything looks so yummy. We finally decided to take a few dishes and share them. We had the croquetas, the calamares Fritos, pork and mashed potatoes and the lentajes con chorizo. Everything was delicious... Well cooked. The lentejas were maybe a bit salty. But I felt like I wanted to have one or two more. But it was not reasonable so I decided to have a dessert \u00a0i took the churros con chocolate... It reminded my childhood when I had churros during my holidays in Portugal. So fucking great! They came with a small jug of melted chocolate! Wow!This was overall a really good experience and I would recommend anyone to make a stop there. \u00a0Waiteresses have been very nice and helpful. The value for money is also very good. So if you guys wanna have a bit of Spain without taking too much money from your bank account, go to Charlotte street and stop by navarro's.We tried the Rioja 2012 red wine they sell by the glass. It was decent but nothing breath taking I am afraid. I think it \u00a0is worth going again and try another one",

    "text": "Let me preface this with the fact that I was born and raised in Spain and all my family is from the Basque country (Hondarribia\\Bilbao\\San Sebastian) so I have a point of reference here. I was excited when I found this on my recent search of restaurants in London and I was pretty excited when I saw the menu. Too bad I was in for an unpleasant surprise. Walking in you see its a small place and some of the servers are definitely from Spain so that's good. Looking at the menu I am thinking ok this is going to be good. Was it? No way. It was basically borderline bad. So for starters it took forever to get service, like 15 minutes just to get to order water. Second, if you want bread which is served automatically everywhere in Spain you gotta order and pay for it. Every other restaurant in London so far just brought us bread and many were not pricey either. So whatever lets order and see what happens. So we order 4 dishes and I expect them to arrive together. They don't and they are mostly spread pretty far apart.Dish 1 - Fried chorizo in Cognac. So in Spain when I order chorizo it shows up as long strips that are fried and then drained. This showed up sliced thin in a red pool of grease. No bread, no nothing with it. Just a spoon, and a whole lot of grease. Its not appetizing and it didnt taste very good this way. It was heavy and kinda gross. If i had other food to balance it with perhaps it would be better but why slice it and serve it in an inch of grease. Epic Fail.Dish 2. Iberico croquetas with god knows what. It was just weird. For those who know how it should be, its a bechamel that is thickened and flavored usually with cheese, ham or cod in my experience (and how my mom makes them). They should be fluffy and crisp with the inside creamy. These were some funny texture and color, being grayish and the taste was just off. I dont know who came up with this recipe but they should throw it out. Fail #2.Dish 3. Potato croquetas with Chorizo, Sounds good right? Well not terrible, the texture what more what I expected but it was pretty bland and had very little chorizo. What I did find was chopped into squares much to large and they probably need to revisit the balance and construction of this recipe. As a cook, yes I can fix this dish. Salt, pepper, maybe some garlic and use a soft chorizo to blend it up. This had potential and may have been the best thing we had which wasn't saying much. Dish 4. Bacalao, or Salt Cod in a tomato sauce with peppers and onions if I recall. The cod was served skin on which I would have preferred removed. it was barely warm and bland, and I am thinking that this was reheated. Something about the dish wasn't striking me as legit here. The dish in all was luke-warm and the fish thin and skimpy. Fail #3.So in summary, we had a disjointed meal served at long intervals with mediocre food and inconsistent service. The girls are very nice, the place is cute but this place needs a service and food smack-down to get it back on track. I dont consider this a good Spanish restaurant and it certainly wasn't cheap by Spanish standards either. The reviews here are either people who got food on a good day or dont really care what they eat. I dunno. All I can say is our meal was expensive and quite bad. Agur.",

The front is a shop selling all sorts of nice Spanish food. The interior isn't super modern or trendy-more down to earth rustic.We came on a Saturday night and the place was reasonably busy. Service was friendly and helpful. On the wine front I wanted red despite ordering mainly fish so wanted a light wine. I was recommended a wine from Jumilla which was only a couple of quid over what I was going to order-it was really good.The lowdown on the food as follows:The calamari was very nice-crisp and tender, not chewy.The cod (Bacalao) was also great-large fillets of cod in a tasty, piquant sauce.The rice was creamy and very rich but tasty.The chorizo supposedly cooked in cognac was..meh! It was essentially a dish of sliced chorizo-not horrible by any stretch but you could not taste the brandy and it was too plain. Some of the pieces were a little burnt.The octopus (pulpo..) was again not my favourite. I wanted large chunks of octopus cooked in a rich sauce. This was slices of octopus on top of creamed spring onion puree. The octopus was lost in the overall taste, which was too similar to the creamed rice. Far from horrid but a slight disappointment.Overall, Navarros is a perfectly pleasant restaurant serving good tapas. Some dishes don't hit the high spot but that may be typical of such places.Oh.. and the patatas bravas were vey good. Loved them!",

    "text": "This tapas joint was quite nice! I visited with my mother in law and a friend. We were sent to sit downstairs in the basement which was cozy, romantic and nicely decorated. We ordered the squid, olives, bread basket, albondigas and charcuterie plate, all excellent! We each had glasses of wine, ordered the small but were a generous pour. The meatballs were so tender and some of the best we've ever had. Definitely recommended!",

    "text": "When I arrived here to meet my friend and his wife, the first thing they said was \"oh, this wasn't the place we thought we were taking you!\" \u00a0It turned out to be a happy accident, as this was a very cute and cozy tapas place with delicious food and nice atmosphere.I tend to think of all tapas restaurants as having the same menu: patatas bravas, chorizo, Serrano ham and Manchego cheese, croquettes... stop me if you've heard this before. This must mean that most people have a binary perception of tapas, they either love it or hate it, and among us tapas lovers any specific restaurant comes down to whether the food is actually cooked properly, plus the service and ambiance. \u00a0In this case, the service was quite friendly and the atmosphere very nice, being a rather small place with a homey feel. \u00a0The food was indeed well-prepared and delicious, so the entire experience was very pleasant. \u00a0If you're on the love side of my love/hate tapas dialectic, you should seek this place out, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "This place was fantastic. I worry about adding to the many highly positive posts about this place... Maybe it becomes so popular I can't even get a reservation someday?The flavors of the four dishes I tried were all subtle. I would have added more garlic and a bit more chili on some, but I'm being really picky. It was all a rare, lovely treat. Not only will I return, but I want to bring everyone I care about to this place. The service was quite good, and the prices were very reasonable for this area. \u00a0Note that gratuity is included in the bill, but frankly if you double tip it's no loss since the service was really above par.Oh, and the decor was great. \u00a0Lots of colorful, Spanish tile. The place was nicely decorated - better than many restaurants.",

    "text": "Slunk into Navarro's one evening when looking for something different in the Goodge st area. There's quite a bit of overpricing in that locale, so did a bit of Yelpage on the hop - Navarro's was one of the best Yelped establishments, and, as it turned out, deservedly so.First off, we had a little trouble getting a table, on a Wednesday evening, but they squeezed us in. It appears a smallish place, but they have a large downstairs area. The place is done out in a authentically, with Spanish tiles and crockery.They serve tapas as well as some main meals and the usual appetizers of bread, olives, cheese and cured meats that you would expect.We ordered 5 tapas between two, which turned out to be a feast. The portions are ample indeed, and just incredibly good. Really delicious authentic dishes, served in an informal atmosphere. Gets a little noisy down there, so book with care if you plan on a private tete-a-tete.The honeyed lamb and scallops were a treat, the lentil stew is heart fayre. Can't wait to go back to this place.",

    "text": "Si! Si! Si!There are a plethora of 'tapas' restaurants in London these days, and many serve pretty much the same old menu. \u00a0At Navarro's you'll find a more authentic experience in many ways. \u00a0And the cost is quite fair for the high quality served. First, the staff are Spanish. The decor is very rustica-type -- with wooden chairs & tables, and lots of blue ceramics dotting the walls & shelves. \u00a0I went here with a few friends and so enjoyed many dishes, but a few stood out:-Pulpo: (octopus) Easy to get wrong. \u00a0Not so here. It was delicious; soft without being chewy, tasting fairly fresh and flavourful.-Lamb: (according to my friend): Succulent, flavoured with rosemary -- my foodie friends were blown away by it.-Calamares: Yes a typical dish, but done very well. Very light batter, crispy on the outside, also soft but not too chewy on the inside.-Poblano peppers: I haven't found these often in London tapas restaurants, although they are usually on the menu in Spain. These peppers have the distinct feature of being randomly hot; that is, within a given batch, you might get 20% which are chili hot, the others taste more like a slightly spicier green pepper. Fried and yummy, my friends hadn't had these before and really liked them. Big lovely servings, obliging staff, and a comfortable atmosphere. \u00a0Me gusta!",

    "text": "Great Spanish place with excellent value. I came with two friends and of course, we ordered some tapas, a bottle of wine and a couple of starters. Pretty standard combination but executed really well. The restaurant is nicely designed and the food is rich and comes in decent portions. They also have a seasonal menu with some specials which are also worth checking.",

    "text": "I have to admit to being very disappointed about this place, especially seeing the fantastic reviews it gets on Yelp. \u00a0It was tapas restaurant no 3 in a weekend of tapas so maybe that was part of the problem but I felt the food was a let down and so was the service.We ordered patatas bravas, Chorizo, Gambos, croquetas and Berenjenas Gratinadas, which are aubergines stuffed with vegetables and topped with a cheese gratin. \u00a0This last item was particularly disappointing having loved it when I had it before but really disliking this version.We got our food quickly enough but our waitress spoke no English and couldn't understand when we asked her for anything outside of the menu. \u00a0We eventually gave up and left quickly, not even bothering with a coffee at the end.I won't be rushing back!",

    "text": "Went here with a group of friends on Valentine's Day for the first time (yes, we are quite the trolls). Restaurant was all decorated on the special day with heart and rose confetti sprinkled over the dinner table. Even the waitresses were all decked up and pretty.Three words I have for this restaurant: LOVE THE BREAD AND DIP. (oh wait, five words already) \u00a0That dip with the garlic.... heaven! (what's it called again? aleo oli? - it's OK that we all got garlic breath later) We refilled 3-4 bread baskets (among the 6 of us) and 2-3 dip saucers because it was that awesome - felt like I could survive on that bread+dip alone. Moving on to tapas: everything was delicious! You cannot go wrong. My favourite was ultimately the calamari. The fried skin was crunchy and the squid was soft and chewy - calamari like I've never tasted before. The wine list was reasonable for us students and we ordered a bottle for six. The waitress's recommendation was spot-on and we really enjoyed the wine with the food. Did I mention the staff were pleasant? Overall, loved the place. The interior was adorable and reminded me a little of Gaudi, while the price was reasonable. Amazing food at affordable prices. What's not to love?",
