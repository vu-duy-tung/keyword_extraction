However, the cinnamon buns kept getting smaller and the number of people kept increasing until it was just impossible to get a table. I decided to stop by today and to my surprise (and delight) the place was almost empty on a Sunday and the cinnamon bun was suddenly much larger again. It is located by Golden Square, so close to Regent Street it is remarkably quiet here, but the place can get packed quite quickly so be prepared that there might not be a table. The interior is quite Scandinavian with a lot of wooden furniture and overall quite minimalistic. Coffee is quite good and there are plenty of cakes to be had, some typical Scandinavian things to eat such as cinnamon buns and Finnish pierogi served with egg butter.",

    "text": "I went along today to the Nordic Bakery to escape from the hustle and bustle of Regent street and it did not at all disappoint. Its interior is spacious with tall ceilings and large wooden panels lining the walls around you. Small warehouse down lights brighten up the space, bringing focus to the nine dark stained tables you sit at. Continuing on in this clean cut, Scandinavian style, only two hanging features adorn the walls, on one side, two green canvas bags also for sale, and a large rug hanging opposite it. Their menu is simple, with a combination between some fresh foods based around cakes and sandwiches, and other items that you might think about stocking in the pantry. The focus for their food is quality food although you may be expecting larger portions for sandwiches that cost up to \u00a34. Amongst their offerings is a serious of traditional Nordic ingredients presented atop a heavy, dark and flavoursome rye bread. Their fillings include smoked salmon, gravadlax, egg and achovy, pickled herring and something more for local taste, cheese and pickle. Each sandwich is pretty satisfying as mentioned before, you may be expecting something more. My server offered me the other piece of bred to turn the open sandwich into a more proper one. My lunch, the gravadlax at \u00a33.75, was extremely tasty and it seemed like they used high quality ingredients, with most of the sandwiches freshly made. I tried their coffee (a latte at \u00a32.20) with my lunch, who's only fault was that it had far too much milk for my liking. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite cut my Where's the best coffee? series of places although I would probably drink it again if I returned to this place. I also couldn't resist trying one of their pastry/cake desserts, trying out one of their cinnamon buns (\u00a32). It was surprisingly heavy, and the warmth gave away that it had been freshly baked. Although not as excessively sweet as I had been expecting, it was slightly doughy and really only half would have been enough. The Nordic Bakery is quite a treat, and unlike many of the other upmarket establishments, somehow keeps an air of serenity without feeling excessively bland or boring.",

I've never had Finnish food before, have you?In classic bakery style, they have a glass case of open sandwiches with dark rye bread and toppings like \u00a0egg and anchovy, smoked salmon and gravadlax. The rye bread is apparently baked in Finland and flown over, um let's ignore those carbon miles. The tastiest option is definitely to order a cinnamon bun and cappuccino. They are known for their fantastic coffee and the buns are so sticky, so cinnamony and just incredibly addictive. Or try an oaty caramel florentine type biscuit. Forget Nero, Costa, all those places, if you are in W1 - the Nordic Bakery is definitely worth a visit.",

But within five minutes tables were cleared and we quickly claimed ours as more customers stumbled in. As the cinnamon rolls had been highly praised and recommended by reviewers, my friend and I decided to share one. And it was perfect. Sticky, cinnamon rich and still warm. I ordered a filter coffee (at \u00a32.00) which was good but not amazing and tad expensive for its size. A lovely place to spend an afternoon catching up with a friend and eating tasty treats. Next time I'd like to try one of their open sandwiches.",

There really is only few things on the menu, so be prepared to try out this healthy bread.

These are not your average cinnamon buns - they're delightfully sticky and have a reassuring heft. You will not be disappointed.They also have great rye bread sandwiches, again done in typical Finnish style. I particular enjoy the ham one - incredibly simple and surprisingly satisfying. They usually ask if you want them open or closed, in other words, whether you want one piece of rye bread or two - opt for the open one, my Finnish friend assures me this is the way it's done. Another thing to note is that you can buy the rye bread in bulk, frozen which my friend does regularly and I have done once too.",

Without a doubt one of the most expensive places to buy a tiny sandwich from in the surrounding Soho area, and that's saying something.My cheese and ham sandwich was drenched in mustard to the point at which I had to scrape it, and it hardly delivered on taste. It was ok, but that's hardly a good benchmark.Equally, the cinnamon bun just didn't cut it for me. It was too big, too dry and rather tasteless.However, the coffee was fantastic, and taking Cate's point below about free WiFi, if you want to go and hang out in a Nordic canteen to work, this is as good a place as any in the area to do it.",

The aesthetic of the place is suitably minimalist and functional with blocks of colour for the furniture and really chunky mugs for the coffee, which I love. My friend is obsessed with the Nordic Bakery's cinammon rolls but I personally prefer their open rye bread sandwiches - especially the ones with smoked salmon.

Filter coffee to my hearts content and fresh cinnamon buns to fill my greedy little gob with.So if this place is so wonderful why only 4 stars? Well I have to say that the portion of attitude that got served with my salmon rye bread snack thing and coffee was a little to sharpe for first thing in the morning. Yes of course I told you black coffee, I never have milk in coffee, why would I tell you to put milk in it if I never have it that way. Also, why is this such a problem? I bet this happens all the time, you work in a coffee shop! Breathe...Right so apart from the Nordic Ice Maiden that served me this place is perfect. It has a bright open seating area that means you can work happily there for a few hours, they have a loo (as always, an important element in any coffee shop), they have a park opposite so you can sit out and enjoy your treats, so all in all its a little bit wonderful. Shame about the price tag on food and service.",

    "text": "I have to say, the filter coffee was pretty fabulous. \u00a0A die-hard Monmouth Coffee fan, I might just have found a worthy contender in the coffee shop battle for my affections. \u00a0Sure, there's only one bean and roast available, but whatever it is, it is smooth and satisfying \u00a0(You know, they probably get it from Monmouth. \u00a0This seems to be the vogue thing to do in London coffee shops). \u00a0It's hard to find real filter coffee in this town, overrun as it is with espresso houses that will either serve you up an americano or give you some filter coffee that's been sitting in an insulated coffee dispenser for god-knows how long. \u00a0The baristas at Nordic Bakery make espresso drinks, but they will also grind and filter a cup for you to order, which I totally dig. \u00a0Mmm... fresh.But the Nordic Bakery isn't just a purveyor of filter coffee, so it should not be judged on my appreciation for its filter coffee alone. \u00a0So, as a formality, I will run down the pros and cons of this fine establishment (that, did I mention, serves up a great filter coffee).PRO: The cup only costs \u00a32 (which is 20p cheaper than Monmouth).CON: Only one type of coffee is available (it is no Monmouth in terms of variety...).PRO: Seating is readily available, plus it's just off Golden Square (more seating! Pigeons! Okay, so this might be a con if you don't like pigeons.)CON: The service walked a fine line between indifference and annoyance.PRO: There's a toilet! And the kitchen downstairs near the toilet smells of delicious cinnamon bun!CON: My cinnamon bun was just so-so (not fresh out of the oven), especially given its \u00a32 price tag.Conclusion: I will undoubtedly return for some more coffee, but I'll check my appetite and service expectations at the door. \u00a0That is, unless the cinnamon buns are fresh from the oven.",

So one morning I decided to stop by and finally try one of their cinnamon bun with a latte.Latte: perfect. Great amount of coffee. Foamy. Nothing to sayBun: I was drooling over the counter while waiting in line. I arrived at 830am and it was not that busy but with one person serving it took what seemed forever. The buns looked fresh, right out of the oven. From the outside it could pass for a chocolate croissant. \u00a32.40 for a bun is a decent price. Especially because it is big. Very filling. However I was disappointed because it was not warm and it was a bit dry (lot of dough). Did not seem fresh. Super sugary and crispy but I expected a whoa moment. And it did not happen.In a nutshell: I dreamed of the cinnamon bun before I had tried it. Do not dream about it anymore",

I have no idea how they make it but it consists of layers of glorious cinnamon sandwiched into rolls of sweet pastry into one of the most delicious treats in all of London. As you sink your teeth into the bun in the wooden panelled surrounds of Nordic Bakery I am immediately transported off to my idea of what life in Scandinavia must be like. What's more, the Nordic Bakery is not just about these buns. The coffee is well made, if not at the level of some of London's new wave coffee bars, and the savoury snacks are tasty as well. I enjoyed gravlax served on a disc of dense dark rye - a moment of pleasure which almost equalled that provided by those fabulous buns.",

And starting off my day with 6oz of coffee felt like a joke.The cinnamon roll was... ok. The exterior was a little dry, like it'd been in the oven a few minutes too long; I've never had a Scandinavian take on a cinnamon roll before so, by all means, this could be how they're meant to be done, in which case, you know where to get your fix! I found the glaze too sticky, the exterior too dry, and the inner layers lacking a satisfying yeast-dough flavour to balance out the surprisingly mild cinnamon.The place was totally silent (no music, barely any conversation), which is actually sort of nice if you're sitting in a corner and trying to wake up, but kinda creepy walking into on a misty morning--like you've just stepped into your neighbour's and caught them in their nighties, and everyone's just feeling awkward about things.I'm half-tempted to come back for the nice-looking sandwiches, but \u00a37 for two tiny \"only ok\" coffees and an \"only ok\" cinnamon roll still leaves me feeling a bit butthurt.",

If you've ever been to scandinavia or the nordics, this place puts you in a catapult and slings you across the sea the minute you walk in the door. I went in there yesterday, having been asked by a friend to go. It's funny because my apartment looks right at the entrance and I should have gone there by now, but every time I've walked past it was busy. AND for good reason. Where else in the UK can you get authentic Lingonberry muffins and a latte the size of a Norwegian viking ship?! I know I know, it might be racist, but seriously, it was good. Lattes are certainly better off elsewhere, but the decor in here and the food makes you feel like you're there. The wood paneled walls and the simple communal wood tables are so chic. I'm glad I went yesterday because there was a photoshoot going on, probably of the owners. Kinda funny because I felt like a rockstar (ok, kinda in the background of pictures of rockstars). Anyway, maybe one day the Monocle will feature this place since they love all things scandic design.

So I was grumpy as hell. The Nordic bakery stood no chance.But then the prettiest girl of all time served me, and my faith was restored. Men are funny creatures -- take us to the Ritz, or take us to McDonalds -- we don't care, just make sure the girls are pretty.I got a tea. The person I was meeting got something else, but why would I remember what it was when the girl serving me was so darn pretty?So I remember nothing.The next night, I'm walking through London with a friend, another female one, and we're looking for a place to grab a tea -- which is when we appeared in Golden Square. So, feeling clever and full of knowledge I said \"oh, I know a place\", and then took us the long way all around the square because I didn't actually know where the Nordic Bakery was.So there I was, second night in a row. And who served us? Of course, the pretty one. Did she remember me? I assume no; I'm not the guy girl's remember, that's the other guy.But she did seem to kind of recognise me -- that guy, the one who's bringing two different women to a little bakery two nights in a row.

I used to think IKEA's kanelbullar Swedish rolls were the Nordic cinnamon bun jam, but these were on some next level.Fresh from the oven and still warm (this was key - not reheated prior to serving, no crunchy hard edges from staying under a warmer for way too long). Flaky, full of cinnamon/cardamom and just the right amount of sweetness. Such a welcome departure from the dense Cinnabon style heavily iced syrupy sweetness (and the accompanying regret filled aftermath). You have to hustle for a table if you want one. This place is packed on the weekends with folks waiting for a table and others giving up and ordering a few cinnamon buns to go. I had a latte with my bun, but the coffee is nothing to write home about. It's going to take all of me to keep from hitting this place up way too often for those crack buns though.",

Unless all you other peeps who said how great it was missed out the part about the constant beeping?!?We needed somewhere to hang whilst waiting for a table at Mildred's that wasn't a bar, so armed with my yelp app I seized the opportunity to steer the gang here and suss it out. The place is a poster child for Scandi starkness and chic, all clean lines and wooden tones. But before I could take this in (or enjoy the coffee/baking smells) I was distracted by an alarm going off. The slightly embarrassed girl at the counter guessed our first question and blurted out, 'Yeahhh *beep* that alarm *beep* is going to keep *beep* going off *beep*...' (annoying just reading that, right?!).It was slightly too loud to easily ignore but the other people in there were doing their best and we decided it was probably manageable for half an hour. Ok yeah - it was the thought of a cinnamon bun that swung it ;)The barista looked relieved and took good care of us - I couldn't help but feel sorry for her. Particularly halfway through our visit when the beep cranked up to a fully-fledged *EEEEEEE* as if the main fire alarm had just gone off, and she had to run over to a box on the wall to hush it back to beeping levels.We ended up starting dinner in reverse, as my mates ordered coffees and teas and I got a cinnamon bun. I fully intended to keep it for dessert and eat it after dinner like a sensible girl, honest. But then the bag was all warm in my hand... and delicious-smelling... so I thought I better have a bite to try it warm. Or maybe ten bites as it turned out. You know, to really be sure.I liked the layers inside and thought it was nice enough, but the outside was a little hard and found the inside quite dry. Perhaps with an hour to closing they weren't as fresh as earlier in the day? I'd be willing to go back and try another (or something else from the counter of yumminess) with a coffee next time.Think it's a cool place for a short stop or coffee date, but it's not a cosy-up-and-while-away-the-hours kinda place. Hopefully they've sorted out the alarm issues too - it was pretty unsettling but as ever sometimes these things just can't be helped and it's more about how they deal with them. Our smiley waitress in the face of adversity was enough for me to give it a second chance :)",

They are my favourite dessert in the entire world and it physically pains me if they've run out and I don't have enough time to wait for the next batch.I've been coming here for years and have patronised other establishments which sell cinnamon buns. Nordic Bakery is, without a doubt, heads and shoulders above the rest, including Fabrique and Bageriet. I don't know how they do it, but their buns are just so full of intense flavour. So, apart from the buns, what else is there to know about this place? Well, there is no Wi-Fi here, and the d\u00e9cor is very Nordic: all dark wood and minimalist, which makes this place look a little small. There's a bakery downstairs, located on the same level as the restrooms. As there's usually another batch of buns being baked at any one time, that means you get to inhale the most delicious smell ever on your way to and from the loo. Hey, why not? There are worse smells you could be assailed by.",

Either you wait or you take it with you.I don't think the atmosphere is any special, but it's reduced to the max and very spartanic - so typical for Nordic style.They sell really awesome cinnamon swirls and other pastries. I even experienced their offer varies a little. Besides the sweets they sell the typical rye bread which also tastes very good. You can buy it plain or prefilled with for example salmon, cheese, ham and so on...Also cool - get the stuff to go and sit at golden square.",

Maybe it's because we didn't get them fresh out of the oven?It was a bit dry on the outer 2 layers, but when you get to the middle, it seems quite dense and stuck to my teeth a bit. Perhaps slightly undercooked (I've posted a picture)? \u00a0Or maybe this is how it's supposed to be? I'm not entirely sure!! Anyhow, with all the great ratings, I would come back and give the bun another try, only if it's fresh.

My Finnish friend always complaints that it's very difficult to find proper Finnish rye bread in London. And this is the only bakery I've come across that sells good Finnish rye bread. I love to toast the bread a little and basically it goes well with anything, cheese, butter & jam, eggs, avocado , etc.And the cinnamon bun didn't disappoint me either. It's just so perfect! A must try!",

I mean it is nice, but I have tasted better. I got a fresh batch, nice hot and fresh. I thought it could be more cinnamony, and lighter, but it wasn't, pastry slightly thicker than I like, and very filling. \u00a0None the less, it went down with a great cup of tea. The venue is simplistic and is located away from the hustle and bustle. But because of free WiFi, its rubbish if you cant get a seat, and lovely if you do. Overall I would return, a nice change from all the cafes around these parts. Service was OK, can get busy at time, so grudge on the staff.",

I search yelp and find the Nordic Bakery, not far away. \u00a0I read the reviews, they appear very good, so I start walking........ It would be difficult to express my level of frustration.First the coffee came out wrong and had to be remade, then the cinnamon roll that was supposed to be on the order was not. \u00a0Okay, things happen, no big deal. \u00a0Coffee (cappuccino) finally arrives, but not cinnamon roll. \u00a0Coffee is pretty good, to be fair.Cinnamon roll has to be reordered and finally arrives, but it arrives as a cinnamon bun, rather than a roll. \u00a0More frustration but at this point recognition there is a simple English language deficiency. Now, I absolutely love a good cinnamon roll, and even bun, when forced. \u00a0So, I am ready....... this was a mistake.The cinnamon bun was bone dry. \u00a0The outside layers were hard as plaster, the inside crumb more smashed together than layered. \u00a0The entire produce simply crumbled apart on the plate.I managed to eat enough of the interior to at least provide something for my stomach to settle, the left the rest piled in crumbs on the plate, uneaten.Maybe it was just a bad day at the Nordic Bakery, maybe they provided day old or more product, maybe this is simply how they make their cinnamon buns. \u00a0Either way, this experience certainly does not match previous reviews. \u00a0I cannot say I will try a second time......",

    "text": "The Nordic Bakery is a name that often pops up in conversations about quality coffee in London. I generally try to visit any place that is meant to have even the slightest reputation for coffee, and this place did not disappoint. Scandinavian countries are notorious for having good coffee and cafes, and this place is pretty authentic in its representation. I love the way the minimalistic d\u00e9cor, with its wooden walls, has made the place feel like a sauna in the middle of the hills somewhere in Scandinavia. As I was on a coffee mission, I didn't get to try any of the food. It all looked really delicious though.",

    "text": "I read about the Nordic Bakery a few months ago in Monocle magazine, in which it was celebrated for its sleek design and general Scandinavian sensibility. \u00a0I went yesterday for a pre-shopping snack. The decor is as one would expect; wooden tables, chairs and cladding on the walls. It works well in the canteen style surroundings, though could use a little attention soon. I had missed breakfast so I went for a coffee and cinnamon bun which came to \u00c2\u00a34 together, which struck me as a reasonable price. The coffee was good. The bun was quite big but manageable as it is made up of layers of pastry. I've never been to Scandinavia but I had a couple of Norwegian friends as a kid and the bun tasted as good as I remembered them being. Due to its flavour and substantial size it definitely filled the hole that had been left by not eating breakfast. They have a range of beers and hot drinks to drink, as well as rye bread sandwiches to eat. Good if you're in the area and looking for a quick break.",

    "text": "I discovered this wonderful little gem of a cafe when my friend suggested we meet here for a coffee. I was a bit dubious about meeting up in Soho and getting caught up in the manic Central London rush, but its location in Golden Square it is actually very quiet and relaxing. The cafe perfectly depicts its Finnish influence in the layout and decor which is very simple with wooden bench like tables and chairs. The smell is divine and the treats on offer are second to none. They serve up the now famous (homemade on the premises and still warm) cinnamon buns which are huge, delicious and go perfect with their latte or hot chocolate if you aren't counting the calories - and if you are, there are also healthy options but you may not be able to resist the cakes! The rye bread is also a popular Finnish choice which makes for a very nice \u00a0healthy alternative.",

    "text": "I think this place is perfect. It is a real respite from the usual crap cafes in Soho. The lack of muzak and wood interior calm the soul and that is without food. I am not a fan of milky coffee which this place seems to specialise in. However, I do recommend the chrysanthemum tea which is a Nordic speciality. It is light, tasty and a refreshing alternative to coffee. I don't think you should visit here without trying one of their cinnamon buns. Make sure you have one still warm from the oven. Personally, they are a little too large for one, so they are a perfect thing to share. I have noticed that sometimes their spice mix changes - I can handle a little bit of cardamon, but sometimes it is too strong for me. If you do get a fresh one, it is doughy perfection. There is something about the depth of dough and the caramelised spices that make you feel like you are sitting in your mother's kitchen. If you are looking for something different try their blueberry wine (non-alcoholic) drink. As it oxidises it changes in flavour, a lot like wine, and is a great accompaniment with lunch. I think the lunch food is a bit too pricey, but it is delicious. Their gravlax is some of the best in London. Oh, they do their rye bread as take away which is great.",

They serve up the now famous (homemade on the premises and still warm) cinnamon buns, which are amazing. They are massive and unhealthy, but worth every bite. Along with one of their superb lattes, it's a naughty treat for the odd occasion! Usually very quiet so I hope they don't go out of business. So everyone must come here and get their teeth into one of their sticky yummy cinnamon creations! Right on Golden Square too, perfect setting.",

    "text": "The pleasing simplicity of the Nordic Bakery strategy of preparing and selling a small range of foods is very successful. The cafe is superbly decorated- it has a high ceiling, lovely decor a reflection of the impeccable style that is so specific to Scandanavia. It was 2007 Runner up Best Coffee Bar in London,because of two things- the first was its coffee and the second was having the winning combination that makes for a quiet contemplative experience of eating and drinking in the shop. Considering that it based in Soho- that in itself is a rarity.As you enter you can place your order and it will be attended to by very charming staff. If you are going to ask for the all too well known open sandwich, ask for the 'lid'. You will get a lot of cured smoked Salmon which is very tasty. If you decide to go for the boiled Eggs and Anchovy version I promise you will not be disappointed - as it is faintly moist at the centre of the yolk.Sweet options range form a variety of Cinnamon Buns,Chocolate Cake and the Swedish Tosca Cake( a very buttery sponge cake with Almond and Vanilla topping)The Espresso is good but it is not perfect. It may be because although the Finnish may be the world's largest consumers of Coffee per capita they still need to work on making slight improvements in how they make their Coffee. For design junkies please note: the Black Tables and Chairs are Alvar Aalto Crockery is Ilittala and there is wall hanging which is recreation of 100 year old design by a Finnish artist.",

My boyfriend was eager to try their sandwiches, although they were very good, the portion size is very small so he ended up having 3! So no real value for money there at \u00a34 a pop. He also had a very nice blueberry juice but at \u00a35,90 per approx 330cm3 bottle, we though it was a little overpriced. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the furniture and decor are nice, though the staff are very grumpy and not very welcoming at all, tough I'd go back for the cinnamon buns ;)",

It is on the outskirts of a little square which is a great place to sit and relax after shopping on Carnaby Street in the summer. The cafe offers dark rye breads, cinnamon buns, coffee, tea, oh yea and vodka, wine, and beer. Its a bit of a strange combination but it works. The selling of alcohol is what separates Nordic from its neighbouring Cafe Nero and Starbucks. The prices are moderate with a cup of tea pricing \u00a31.50, coffee is \u00a32.00. You order and pay at the counter but the sweet barista in a denim full length apron will bring your drinks/food to where-ever you want to sit. It is a lovely warm inviting environment with candles sparkling on the dark wooden tables and chairs. This cafe should be in the Finnish woods not in the heart of London. It brings a bit of piece and tranquility to the busy capital if it had Wifi I would never leave.",
