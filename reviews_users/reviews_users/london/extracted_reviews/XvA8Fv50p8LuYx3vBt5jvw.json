    "text": "Foxlow does great steak, but my dinner was a flawed experience due to a menu that promises more than the restaurant delivers.It was a Friday evening, I think, and the idea was to go there for a date. Well, it did not quite pan out as planned...Anyway, I was hungry and decided to go to Foxlow on my own, slightly later than expected and without a booking - the good news is that I got a table.Foxlow is a beautiful place on St. John Street, an east London destination full of great restaurants. The atmosphere at Foxlow is casual, relaxed, really friendly and a little bit hipster, but not overly cool and by that easily bearable even for people like me without a fashionable moustache or a sharp suit. I still think it would be a good place for a nice dinner for two, but it also works well for bigger groups.Unfortunately, I did not have to wait long for the second setback of the evening. Quickly I spotted their signature white wine, a Riesling. No question, I wanted to taste it. Bugger, they did not have it. Promising me a Riesling and not delivering on that promise is one of the worst nightmares on a lonely evening out. And it is difficult to make up for such a mishap. So I had to go with a second-best choice and ordered a Pinot Gris, that actually went very well with the steak. Back to the steak later, first on was smokehouse rillette for starters. It tasted fine, but there was nowhere near enough bread for me. And I was surprised, that I did not get complimentary bread anyway - I was somehow expecting that, but maybe I am wrong. As main, I had ordered the rib fillet and it came juicy and full of great flavour. The peppercorn sauce I had with the steak was also tasty and well-balanced. The fourth setback of the evening was inevitable when they were out of beef dripping potatoes. The skin-on chips I got instead were good, but not exceptional.The highlight of my dinner came at the end with the dessert. The chocolate orange delight really was absolutely delicious.Difficult to rate this evening at Foxlow - service was friendly, but overall they did not quite meet my expectations.",

    "text": "My idea of a good restaurant can be measured by the simple question \"will I go there again?\" And my answer is No I booked a table at 6:30 on toptable website - decided that I need a later time but it seemed to be impossible to get any booking any day of the month! (There were couple of slots available for dinner at 5:30!!) So I decided to go with my initial booking and here is my points about this place: 1- location: I had to pay \u00a315 x2 in cabs to and from Foxlow2- when we arrived at 6:30 the restaurant (which consists of a bar area, main dinning room, and mesanine) was nearly empty The host asked me to follow him upstairs and gave me a table right next to a big pillar!!! I was unhappy at this point - asked for a change of place and I was given another corner table on top floor (all tables down are fully booked- they were empty) clearly I don't look that presentable that Foxlow staff even though are kindly allowing me a seat but not to be seen in there - so I settled for the table and was happy hearing some voices representing some dinners in the place3- Service. It was really good and friendly and no complains whatsoever- everything on the menu I asked about I got an answer for However, I asked if my Auvergne main course is enough in terms of portions and my host said yes I did not think it was filling as a main course despite me sharing three starters and a side dish4- Food. it was ok nothing special to make me go there again but reasonably priced. 5- Wine. Extensive wine list and cool looking cocktails 6- Dessert. Peanutella is so yummy- cherry tart not that good \u00a07- Toilets. Not clean !! (They only opened two days ago) This is my unbiased review",

Good tactic!He seemed really keen and excited to make sure we made the most of our time there, and made great recommendations for us. The slaw goes really well with the beef rib, by the way.

They also have some more unusual cuts which was great to try. The food was excellent, very high quality and cooked and seasoned perfectly. Service was impeccable, nothing was too much trouble. It was such a good place to be we stayed from 7pm until nearly 11pm. Pricing was reasonable for the quality - it's not cheap, but it's also not a huge splurge. I'll be back I'm sure!",

It's a very decent space and perfectly comfortable scene. Cool but relaxing. Few beers the night before meant we were straight on the bloody Mary's and coffee. I'm happy say both these were top grade. Quick service too. The brunch menu isn't huge but has everything you ever need. Sweet and savoury options that include a cracking fried chicken waffle dish. I went for the steak and eggs whilst a mate took on the brunch burger. As kickers we nailed some sweet potato and kale hash and avocado. Another coffee in the food arrived in style. Two fried eggs accompanied my perfectly cooked (medium-rare if ya asking) steak and the burger across from me was a master piece. Huge sausage, fresh burger tomato, hash brown, mushroom all in there, with a fired egg dripping down. It looked and apparently from the reviews was epic. The sides were just as decent, also I love spice and asked for some and they've got a cracker. The name, Christ On A Bike and the taste is sensational. This with steak, egg and sweet potato all on one fork sent me directly to food heaven / coma. You'll have a search on your hands to find a better, more satisfying brunch in the city. And the price is decent for the quality you get too. Get involved.",

    "text": "Just finished a lovely sunday brunch here with 5 friends. We decided to have brunch just yesterday and we've been wanting to check this place out for a while. We were pleasantly surprised that they were able to fit in such a big group at a day's notice and they were very flexible when our group dropped from 8 to 6 on the morning of.The decor here is nice; a diner-like feel but classier. When we arrived at 11am it was completely empty and very quiet, given that they only open at 11am on Sundays. This ended up being a good thing as they were quite quick with service. The coffee here was surprisingly good. \u00a0I ordered a flat white and whilst the milk was a bit bubbly it was thin and strong, as a good FW should be. Hubby ordered a piccolo and the waitress was very keen to get it right... making it twice to make sure he was satisfied. Everyone else at our table seemed happy with their americanos, some going back for seconds.We went to this place because some reviews had said it's the best breakfast burger in London. Two of our party ordered the burgers and thought they were good. In their opinions, the bun was soft and sweet, the egg perfectly cooked. The sausage patty was apparently not the best and the portions were a little smaller than they would have liked. \u00a0Both guys got the mushroom on the side (and gave it to their wives!) Me and two of my friends ordered avocado on toast which was delicious with really well-balanced flavours of lime & chilli. Good portion size (one large piece of toast with probably half an avocado). I ordered the sweet potato hash as I was intrigued about what it was. It was disappointing, though I wonder if healthier folk might have loved it. The sweet potato was a little undercooked and there was too much onion and kale to the proportion of sweet potato. It was not the sweet potato hash BROWN I had in my head. The bill worked out at just over \u00a315 each for coffee, brekky & sides. \u00a0All in all, a really strong brunch effort and bonus points for the great coffees. \u00a0We'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Firstly, a big vote of thanks to my Yelp buddy Andrew M, who has his finger on the pulse of the food scene in the capital and more importantly, his finger on the all important 'send e-mail' button for soft openings.Andrew managed to snag a precious table at Foxlow's soft opening, giving us 50% discount on food. Foxlow comes from the same stable as the Hawksmoor steakhouse group and as such, there was quite a lot of meat on the menu but as our waiter pointed out, this venture gives them the chance to try out non meat itemsThe service was great, even when the restaurant gradually filled up. A small issue with the low level of lighting was quickly resolved when we asked about it. Smooth for a soft openingAs there were 4 of us and 50% discount, it was necessary to try out as many dishes as possible. The only mystery to me was the salad bar, which seemed an odd description as it seemed that they would bring us increasing amount of vegetable dishes for more money rather than us being to serve ourselves from a salad bar. We passed on thatMy favourite starter was the squid - crispy and hot from the fryer and served with a nice mayo accompanimentThe star of the meats was the 12 hour beef rib - fall off the bone tender and oh so juicy. I also really enjoyed the deckle, which was on the specials board as the unusual cut of the day. I gather it comes from the edge of the rib and full of flavour, as was the ribeye cooked medium rareA myriad of sauces were lovely as they all tasted different, so it was good to experiment. I liked the fries but the portions aren't the biggest, so our waiter's suggestion of getting 2 portions for 4 of us was spot onWe had dessert to share but to be honest, they were mainly ice cream based concoctions which were nice but not that memorableThough they're trying to differentiate themselves from Hawksmoor, the star of my meal was the steak. At full price, I think that it is a little expensive but I would certainly recommend Foxlow as a good alternative for steakThanks, Andrew!",

    "text": "Big thanks to Andrew M for being crazy--I mean dedicated enough to secure a booking for 4 at Hawksmoore's new restaurant, Foxlow. \u00a0So.. thanks! After receiving 14,000 emails in 1 day requesting for a much-coveted reso during their 50% off soft launch, one of those lucky reso's went out to Andrew. \u00a0So YGO, Katie B and myself were able to test out their new menu at half price.. and trust me, you won't be disappointed! The menu had a good selections of slow roasted meats, fish, and a good selection of sides and veg. \u00a0There is also a blackboard with the cuts of the day, Nothing too fancy, but they were oh-so-delicious! All the meats come from Ginger Pig, so you know you're getting the good stuff, but the prices were incredibly affordable, even without the discount. \u00a0Appies ranged from \u00a36-9, sauces \u00a31, sides \u00a33.50-4.50, mains: \u00a310-18, meats from the fresh sheet: porterhouse \u00a38.90/100g, prime rib $7.90/100g.. so, pretty affordable, especially coming from the Hawksmoore family. \u00a0The squid was good, nice meaty pieces with a (chipotle?) mayo that went with it, but I didn't care so much for the smokehouse rillettes. \u00a0It was just mashed up bits of meat spread on bread. \u00a0Our meats for the night were the deckle, rib eye, bacon ribs with maple and mustard, and the beef shortribs with kimchi. \u00a0My favorites went in this order: rib eye, beef shortribs, deckle, and I didn't care so much for the bacon ribs as it was a bit on the fatty side, whereas compared to the other cuts of meat, they were just SO juicy and tender!!You must order the fries! \u00a0The server suggested we order 2 fries instead of 1, and right he was. \u00a0These fries never went soggy, crispy on the outside, and really - I just needed the fries to eat the amazing Kimchi Ketchup that they had! \u00a0You must order this.. Katie B and I were trying to find things to mop up that ketchup, though I think we should have just finished it off by the spoonful. \u00a0The sprouted broccoli could have been taken off the cooker a few minutes early. \u00a0I would have liked a bit of a crunch too it, it was a bit too soft for my liking, but it wasn't completely overcooked. \u00a0I really did like the roasted veggies - different from just the standard potato and carrots! \u00a0They also had a wedge of Kabocha squash - if you haven't had this before, its awesome... a sweet pumpkin, commonly used in tempura as well (and makes a much better soup than butternut squash!). \u00a0As for the salad bar - we didn't order from this, but they had dishes listed off as a side, starter, or main (\u00a34, 7, 10), with a selection of 5 veggie dishes. \u00a0You pretty much get 1, 2, or choice of 3 items respectively - but the server did say if you wanted to try a bit of everything, you'd get a small serving of each. \u00a0Interesting, but no one seemed as interested in that as the meats. We were pretty much stuffed by this point, but had room for dessert. \u00a0As a disclaimer, I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so as everyone else at the table mentioned... my opinion doesn't really count here :) \u00a0We did order a bourbon caramel, and PB&J sundae, along with salted caramel popcorn, and peanutella on toast. \u00a0If anyone was curious, I liked the bourbon caramel sundae :) Service was excellent, our waiter was very knowledgeable in his cuts of meats , and very prompt with the service. After the discount on food, with the service charge in, it came to $28pp (and this was including our full priced drinks). \u00a0Not bad at all! \u00a0Even if we were to pay full price, you would have a very affordable 3-course dinner + drinks ringing in at \u00a340-\u00a350. \u00a0The soft launch was very well executed, and I would definitely come back again! \u00a0Job well done :)",

The decor is relaxed but stylish with an open kitchen which is always nice. \u00a0 There was a table of 7 of us and we were served attentively and in a friendly manner. Our waitress was more than happy to give us more information about the menu. \u00a0 We had the fried chicken sandwich, the mac and cheese and chicken salt fries and all were really delicious. The mac and cheese was the dish I was most worried about as so many people get it wrong but this was pretty decent. \u00a0 One word of advice : do not take any vegan friends here. They literally have next to nothing on the menu for them but for veggies and carnivores it's wonderful.",

Chicken.I'm hesitant to give Foxlow 5 stars only because I'm afraid it will soon be another restaurant that is too popular on weekends for people like me who do not plan ahead.Being a fan of Hawksmoor, I signed up for the Foxlow mailing list before they opened. A month back they sent out an email with a picture of fried chicken and I knew I needed to try it. I walked in at 7 on a Saturday and to my surprise they had a table available.Started with the crispy five pepper squid. Pretty typical and similar to salt and pepper squid at Chinese restaurants. The fried chicken, though, was amazing. 4 jumbo pieces of crispy, crackly dark meat (drums & thighs) served with habanero vinegar. The vinegar didn't do much for me, and would have preferred an option of frank's red hot or ranch, but the chicken was flavorful enough that I didn't need it.",

The featured item based on reviews are fried chicken and the \"10 hour short rib\". On a Tuesday I picked incorrectly. Perhaps they should look into a 6 hour rib. I may have received a Monday rib, it was quite dry, it would've been a decent roast beef serving on Sunday, if there was gravy available to moisten it. I asked for gravy or a wine sauce after tasting, my choices were ketchup or bbq sauce.Disappointed, possibly an off-nite for Foxlow considering other reviews.",

    "text": "Our favorite meal of a week long stay in London. Casually setting with excellent service. After seeing pictures of the short rib on yelp I was heartbroken to learn they no longer make it. As luck would have it they have a rib appetizer that I ordered as a main dish. Absolutely every dish had a surprising amount of flavor and was perfectly cooked. Started with a grilled zucchini salad with goat \"curd\" aka cheese. Then came the ribs. They had the perfect amount of fall off the bone tenderness and slight spice. The macaroni and cheese is wonderfully tangy and creamy. My son got the burger and fries - best fries I've had in a long time: very crispy and flavorful. The sticky toffee pudding was perfect. Here's my only critique: I ordered a scotch with dessert and it was the smallest pour I've ever gotten, barely two swallows so I ordered another. Overall amazing quality for the money. This week I've had meals that were more than twice as much that were not half as good. Foxlow better still be around next time I come to London!P.S. for parents: there is a kid's menu!",

    "text": "My friends and I came here for the Sunday roast, after one of them had visited for brunch and gotten insane food envy watching all the plates of roast go by. It is run by the same people that do Hawksmoor, which is also known for having an amazing roast, so I was pretty confident that it would be a good meal. The roast menu is fairly straightforward - in fact, they only have one option, and it's beef - so that made it pretty easy for us to order, despite coming with a party of 9. We also ordered two sides of macaroni and cheese for the table.The roast was solid and well executed, but writing this review just a few hours later, there was nothing particularly notable about it. The beef was perfectly pink with just a bit of brown on the edges, but it wasn't a particularly generous helping, as I think most people only had about 2 slices. I thought mine was extremely chewy, and it was even hard to cut because of all the fat in it. The three roast potatoes on the plate sat in a nest of the Yorkshire pudding, and I thought those were very good. The vegetables were perhaps the most disappointing... the carrots and parsnips were cut into very small pieces, and there were a good 15ish pieces of each, but nothing very notable about them. There was also some cabbage as well. Gravy came served in a cute metal pitcher, but I could have definitely used more! My friends could not stop complimenting the mac n cheese. It was a very stringy cheese and the top also had a delicious crust.It was very quiet on a Sunday afternoon at 3 PM, with only a few other tables dining in the restaurant. The kitchen closes at 3:30 PM, so we were near the late end of the day. There were a lot of families with kids, and we even saw the staff bring out two ice cream cones to one table! I think this is a great place for a casual, relaxing meal... and in our case perfect for group nursing Sunday hangovers.",

    "text": "My first impression was this has a nice layout. I like the crisp and clean decor. I got to sit on the comfy banquette in the corner.I knew what I wanted before I saw the menu, but gave it a cursory browse anyway. It would have been remiss not too. As I intended, I ordered the ribs. To not appear obsessed with only ribs, I got a side of fries and a cider.At the beginning, the service was efficient. They took my order right when I was ready and I got my cider soon after. The food came only minutes after that.You get two short ribs for \u00a39, so it seems pretty expensive. But, wow, they are one of the best foods I have ever tasted! I thought about what lunch was going to cost overall and thought 'yeah, if they ask me whether I want anything else, I'm getting some more ribs!' The meat was just so delicious and had the 'fall of the bone' quality that I was craving. Admittedly, parts of it were just fat, but it was so nice and it just felt right to consume as much as I could without actually eating the bone itself.The ribs came with a sweet and spicy chilli sauce. I ended up dipping my fries into it, after I poured them out all over my plate. The chickeny coating was tasty.I was waiting for a while and I thought that was it, but I was brought a dessert menu. The chance for more ribs had passed but I went for the Elvis Presley sandwich, of which I had heard great things. It was ok, but I may have been just as satisfied with a hot caramel sundae from McDs.I felt a bit ignored at the end. They seem to be concentrating more on setting the tables than asking me if I want to order anything else. It's too bad, as if they had just asked if I wanted anything else, I would have had double ribs. Good thing that I brought a book!",

    "text": "By the time Antonia turned up I'd pretty much made my mind up on the menu. I got a tip from Jess the Bao on Twitter to have the Anchovy & Goat's Butter Crisps (\u00a33) as a snack and I'm glad we took her advice. You get 3 crisps for your \u00a33 and I thought they lovely little mouthfuls - salty anchovy, creamy butter and cheese and crispy... crisp but Antonia wasn't a fan, which made the 'who get's the last one?' decision easy.Another thing you expect from Hawksmoor is a great cocktail menu and there were some interesting ones on the menu here, especially the Smokestack Mary - gin, tomato, chipotle, smoked paprika and peated Scotch (\u00a37) and the Pickle Buck - rye, maple, lime, pickle juice & ginger ale \u00a38.50. We went for wine in the end though and after some very knowledgable advice from Ema decided to ignore everything she said and go for the Rosso Piceno, Ci\u00fa Ci\u00fa 'Bacchus' 2012 at \u00a323, which worked well with the rich flavours we were about to have.As a starter we had the Crispy Five Pepper Squid, which was as good as any but on the small side for \u00a37. Torn between the Eight Hour Bacon Rib with Maple & Chilli and Ten Hour Beef Shortrib with Kimchi (both \u00a316) I opted for the latter and wasn't disappointed. Lovely, smokey meat falling off the bone with good kimchi to cut through some of the fat. Antonia had the Iberico Pork 'Pluma', supplied by Brindisa (\u00a316), which was served medium, full of flavour and perfectly charred on the outside.",

    "text": "Established by the creators of Hawksmoor, would Foxlow be a chip-off-the-old-block or a cheap knock-off? Well, I was actually pleasantly surprised by the variety and consistent quality offered by Foxlow. Not only does it provide a good range of options for steak and accompanying sauces but it has many other delights on the menu including plaice, salmon, beef shortrib with kimchi, not to mention a decent scope of snacks, starters, brunch options and Sunday Roast. The dessert and drinks menus are also given some unique attention to quality and originality. I recommend the Five Pepper Squid as a starter and the ham and cheese cronut for the novelty of having a nice cronut. Overall, I find steak restaurants rather limited in choice and originality but Foxlow offers the best of both worlds. It is almost a perfect restaurant if not for the tap-water-filled glasses smelling slightly of washing-up liquid and \u00a0the decor being a little uninspired unlike the food and drink.",

    "text": "Foxlow is the newest offering from the Hawksmoor founders, Will Beckett and Huw Gott, who have decided to take a step back from the popular steak house and work on something more \"intimate\". And in Foxlow, they've achieved just that. The menu remains fairly meat heavy with chalkboards of the steak cuts on offer dominating the walls but has diversified with both fish and vegetarian main options making appearances including a range of mixed vegetable salads. Plus, with mains (including steaks) being priced in the \u00a318-25 range, it's a more affordable dining option while the friendly staff and smaller tables and booths lend to a cosy and relaxed atmosphere. All said, Foxlow looks like another winner for both the dynamic duo and London's diners.Steaks do feature prominently as you'll see the cuts on offer before even sitting down. Ask your waiter for some info on the meats - our guy Ned was absolutely spot on with recommendations and knowledgeable enough to continue a discussion about aging methods as well as exactly where the cuts were on the Ginger Pig Longhorn cattle. Get the Deckle! It's a fattier cut from the edge of the rib and absolutely delicious. Grilled medium rare, the meat remains tender which the rendered fat provides plenty of flavour. Between the deckle and the rib eye (which was no slouch), the deckle won hands down in our group of four.We opted for a couple of non-steak mains: the 12 hour beef rib and the 8 hour bacon rib. The beef rib was beautiful both to behold and taste which a smoky dark crust glistening with juices over meat so tender it falls off the bone. It's fatty but not overwhelmingly so and \u00a0full of beefy goodness - no wonder it was the first to be devoured. The bacon rib, while tasty, was a bit too much - I love bacon but prefer it crispy and with pancakes rather than in a chop form.Sides were up to scratch with the bacon salt chips and roasted autumnal veggies both getting positive feedback from the group. The chips in particular stay crispy till the very end and our waiter's recommendation of doubling our initial order to two was a wise one indeed. The broccoli was a tad overcooked but not so much to ruin the taste - still a minute or two less would have kept that crunch in each bite.Oh, and I'd be remiss in not mentioning the sauces: kimchi ketchup, peppercorn, bbq, bernaise, and a chilli anchovy butter. All were enjoyable but of particular note was the kimchi ketchup with had Katie B crying tears of joy (and debating whether to eat it straight with a spoon) and the bbq which was spicy and moreish and tempted me to drink it straight.Ahhh and desserts! My favourite was the bourbon caramel sundae which came with a pot of bourbon caramel sauce as well although I could easily eat the bag of salted popcorn as a snack at any time. Katie demolished the PB&J sundae (also top notch) which has bold fruity flavours. The peanutella was good but the brioche bread it was served with ended up too crumbly to be much use - luckily we had no qualms about eating it straight.While we went for the soft open (which was damn near flawless) and got 50% off our food, the prices are quite reasonable and I'd be happy to head back there again. Plus it's close to the office and home so it makes a easy dining option. It's a great place to catch up with a \u00a0few friends or take a date to impress without breaking the bank.",

Chicken sandwich- fried to perfection with good slaw. The crunch left us satisfied. As a bonus they had thought we ordered the fried chicken and not the fried chicken sandwich so they brought the chicken and just left it for us free of charge.Glasses of wine were good but not excellent. Both of us tried the red wine from the house purveyor. Ross or someone. Atmosphere of lower lights and cosy tables. Wish we had room for dessert. What a great neighborhood find.",

    "text": "I was pretty excited about trying Foxlow. Like, super excited. I'd read some reviews and I was expecting Hawksmoor quality food (obv, as they own it) and ambience.The place looks pretty cool inside, particularly like its a neighbourhood restaurant. And TBH where it's at its completely blending in. I mean Clerkenwell is all about rich students, known artists and generally people who got the dolla.Getting in and being seated was a breeze, the service was generally outstanding. The crowd was highly similar to Hawksmoor, lots of suits and slightly less hip crowd, contrasting the feel of the place.On to the food, deciding wasn't that hard as the menu is rather limited. We happened to go on the day that City AM (a local paper for people who mostly work in the banking industry) had posted a review about it. I didn't read it but my friend had and he suggested that we avoid the salad bar (which you don't get to do it yourself, the staff fill the plate for you).So I followed. I decided on Pork Ribs (and some calamari) to start with.Not using my hands was completely out of the question. I dug in, taking in the whole meatiness with my bare hands and loving every minute of it. I might have experienced a drip of sweat from the starters.Main courses. I ordered the beef shortrib which it came on a rather sad looking plate, with an equally sad portion of tangy kimchee on the side. I was prepared for the looks of it, I'd done my reading. What I wasn't prepared for was the hardness of the meat. This is meant to be slow cooked. This is meant to be tender (emphasise that). The kimchee and outstanding quality of the meat worked well in hiding some of the dryness.We went for a mixture of sides so we'd all mix and match. The anchovy broccoli was the winner - this stuff is GOOD. Roasted potatoes in beef dripping were as expected fluffy and yummy and their chips resembled Hawksmoor chips. I couldn't smell the fat in the chips but that only means that they kept that refreshed. The vegetables were just vegetables. Pretty well made I say.Now my friends' slab of bacon smothered in BBQ and maple sauce was delish. The meat was falling off the bones and it was beautifully tender. Presentation wise, it seemed like they need to work on it. I liked the fact the plates were warm.I've also sampled the Iberico Pork Pluma which was by far the tastiest. Contrary to everything I was taught growing up (cook pork well), this was reddish in the middle (medium cooked) \u00a0and sliced in fairly thin, long strips with too much flavour. I wish I'd ordered that. The desserts were amazing, Peanutella & Sweet Toast was brilliant, think a deconstructed Snickers bar. Cherry pie was pretty great too. All in all a great place with good food and wine. I'll be back.",

Great Environment Loved the location. It's the perfect combination of rough edges and fine lines.I'd definitely come again and again. If there's one nitpick, the bar didn't have a very extensive or diverse beer list.",

It got quite busy in the evening due to their Tuesday night special of no corkage byob. We ordered the pork meatballs to share. These were in a rich marinara sauce and a nice starter for the meal. I ordered the 3 piece drumstick while Giulio has the fried chicken sandwich which came with a side of fries as well. Both were done quite well as my chicken was tender on the inside and very crispy on the outside. My entree came with a side of slaw with a habanero dressing and was given a side of oil/vinegar as well. Overall this is a fantastic place especially for those working in the Clerkenwell area. They take large party reservations on their website.",

    "text": "Had an excellent brunch here a few weeks ago! It was a very relaxed and friendly place, a good choice for dealing with a hangover. There were definitely nods to their relationship with the Hawksmoor, though it still had it's own personality and charm. Perhaps most importantly for this occasion, the staff were very patient and welcoming to a large group of hungover people! We arrived just to early for the main menu or the Sunday Roasts to be ready, but the Brunch menu has a lot of good options, many of which take advantage of the fact that the restaurant really is known for it's steak! The bottomless Bloody Marys were well mixed, spicy without killing your tastebuds, generously poured and frequently refreshed - one of the better Bloody Mary's that I have had in London, and certainly the most attentive bottomless brunch.For the food, it's hard to look past the full breakfast, which is a real feast and has some interesting touches such as the sweet potato hash and a slight spice to the tomato. If you wanted a change from the usual, then both the fried chicken with waffles, and the steak with harissa were superb - everything we ordered had a little tinge of spice to it, which was great for a cold winter brunch. The vegetarian options were more limited, but as all of our group are ardent carnivores, that wasn't an issue for us.",

    "text": "I dedicate my 2500th review to Foxlow. Happily. Enthusiastically. Wholeheartedly (wholestarredly?) Anyway... What.a.GREAT.fleeckin'.meal.date.dinner.drinks.etc::::A Weekend Favorite with Ease::: A last minute change of plans left us with an open dinner slot, as I did a search of my bookmarks and unearthed Foxlow I anticipated it might be busy (like everything in London) -- but luckily Clerkenwell is a wee bit sleepy on the weekends, much to the joy of locals like me. Booked us a table for 2 at 730pm (online, easy peasy) and when we arrived we were whisked to a lovely table amidst a nice crowd of dates, families, etc enjoy each others company and great food. (*not super duper trendy, but very stylish and comfortable and nice...the perfect speed if you aren't into trying too hard all the time, really). Next up, BRUNCH. It shall be done. That menu looks mighty. :::Exceptional Service:::From the moment we walked in (more on that later) to the moment with left everything about the service was absolutely on point. It was a serious joy to be there. In a city where service sometimes suffers unapologetically, Foxlow sets the bar HIGH. If you are looking for a place that will treat you right and earn your money, this is it. It was a pleasure to add additional tip for our server and we genuinely enjoyed our experience because of her. Perfect balance and pacing, just great. And this went for everyone -- anyone that we interacted with was lovely. The hostess that greeted us, the barmen that brought our wine, the woman who presented our food and dessert. All equally pleasant and professional. How do they do it!? Why can't everyone do it like this!? ::::Food & Drinks -- YESSIR::::We started with cocktails: Foxlow Mimosa (gorgeous) for me (I wanted to order 800 more but needed to be civilized). We graduated to a red wine to enjoy with our meals and it was a delight (he ordered it, apologies on the vague nature! I was just happy wine was arriving). The real star is the FOOD. I was feeling ambitious and went with the prime rib, which is served with bone marrow. It was out of the planet, I'm off my head about it. I don't even know. I wanted to order a second but see note above about appearances. My husband enjoyed the fried chicken (he posted a pic!) which was a heaping basket of fried heaven. We split several of the very nice (and well priced!) sides: broad beans, crunchy green slaw, gem salad, tomato salad. AND HOLD THE PHONE: those chips with chicken salt should be illegal they are so good. ILLEGAL. Except for I'd be in jail because I ate way more than half and had to apologize to my husband who was left with green slaw. Too bad for you, mate. Too bad! Top things off with a soft serve sundae...and well, there you have it. High quality food that isn't trying to be overly frou-frou, but hits every note exactly right. :::Price Point -- what!?:::For all this I expected to pay the equivalent of one month's rent but in fact it was all really rather reasonable considering! Example, steak was \u00a321, most sides were \u00a33-4, mimosa was \u00a37. Given the location (Central London), style and quality -- we felt it was a screaming deal for the money. ..and this I'll leave you with: husband: \"Feel this door handle. Feel it.\" me: \"yes, it's a...door handle.\"husband: \"No, it's THE perfect door handle - the design is flawless. I just want to keep opening the door to this place over and over again.\" ...and, I guess we will be exercising that door handle often. Winner winner chicken (salt, on the fries!) dinner never rang truer. If you need a spot for family, friends, laid back but excellent vibe and food, this is your spot. Cheers to 2500 reviews. It's places like this that make the local effort worth exploring over and over again. *also seems relatively kid-friendly, there were several parties with children when we dined. We luckily did NOT have ours, but it's nice to know!",

We topped off w fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and several cups of coffee. The mains were each under 10 quid and just exquisite and not overly portioned.

    "text": "I booked the Foxlow's Clerkenwell site for a Sunday afternoon Valentine's Day brunch with my boyfriend. After a notable meal there last May, I had the same high expectations for this more casual visit. The Foxlow's brunch menu delivers a selection that diverts from the customary full English: think trendy Moroccan baked eggs with green harissa, avocado and feta smashed on toast and their signature croissant waffle- served with fried chicken and eggs- instead. The prices are also reasonable, with most plates under a tenner. The Foxlow is a spin-off concept from the team at the much-lauded Hawksmoor, providing a more relaxed neighbourhood bistro setting focused on serving great, locally-sourced produce. There are now three locations around London, but the flagship and central site remains consistently busy. Even on a Sunday, when Clerkenwell can resemble a ghost town, the restaurant was packed and lively. We were escorted through the main open floor space to a more contained section adjacent to the wine bar. A catchy mix of classic rock and 80s anthems wafted through the air and the servers were chirpy and unperturbed, creating a relaxed mood ideal for languid Sunday dining.While the Foxlow excels with its warm ambiance and affable staff, we were stunned at the disorganisation that was so strongly apparent that afternoon. Diners were left waiting to order and were unable to command the attention of the sole, overstretched server in our area. Food was sluggish to appear- to the extent where two tables around us were offered complimentary drinks and starters and one couple opted to leave before their food arrived. We received a profuse apology for the delay with our meal and couldn't find our server when we tried to order an additional side of toast.I had the baked Moroccan eggs, served on a stewed tomato and chickpea base, drizzled with spicy green harissa and finished off with a dollop of yogurt. I also ordered a side of Sobrassada toast. The baked eggs came in a decent sized portion, but I found the two small slices of toast frugal. The tomato base was full-bodied and flavoursome, but arrived searing hot; my eggs were overcooked, rubbery and dried out, lacking the gooey yolks that I anticipated. The sauce was tasty, however, and carried a nice punch of harissa, but I didn't send the dish back because of the prolonged wait. I ate around the eggs, but found even the toast was rock hard. I would have preferred a warm, pillowy flatbread to scoop up the juices and yogurt.My boyfriend was lured away from the brunch fare. Instead, he opted for a basket of fried chicken, which came with fiery habanero vinegar. He was much happier with his choice, which arrived as a generous bundle of wings and thighs that were amply seasoned and coated in a golden crispy shell. Evenly fried and appealing to the eye- with no resemblance to the sickly and greasy chicken of the local chicken shop- the meat inside was moist and elevated by the spicy and sharp notes of the vinegar.This visit to the Foxlow was unfortunately inconsistent with our past experience, but I hope that it was a matter of catching them on an off day. While the lengthy wait for food was admittedly a huge disappointment, the atmosphere and staff are pleasant and I'm not writing them off just yet.",

Back onto the food though, I don't think I've ever had salmon that tasted so good, it was perfectly cooked and the sauce just complimented. Inside what nice and soft, not as hard as rock which would of been dreadful. I'm more of a cod person over a salmon as it tastes a little less salty, however on this occasion it didn't put me off and would definitely try this dish again.",

    "text": "This is a beautiful space; the staff is great, and chill, and totally not rushed (as in; we felt like we could just settle down into the booths and really catch up). WIN ON ALL THESE FRONTS.That said, I was SO pumped to eat here (5 stars from Colleen C and Yee Gan O.? On the to-eat list for sure!) and I was left feeling...fine. It was - putting on my teen lingo - \"totes fine\". You can see the Hawksmoor-ian influence, and maybe this is where I went wrong: should I have gone for some meatier options? Our table went for some lighter Sunday brunch fare: green juices, avocado toast, americanos, sweet potato and egg hash. Foxlow's take on shakshuka - basically a tomatoey stew with eggs atop - was nice, but served without bread. We got some, with a surcharge, which again is a small deal in the big scheme of things but...was that mini skillet of eggs suspended in tomato meant to be eaten just like so? It felt like there were a few little tricks at play to get more \"sides\" offered, and I wasn't on board. Maybe it's just restaurant psychology, but I'd much prefer being charged 50p more per dish and just bring the dish to me, complete. Perhaps this is a carry-over from the steakhouse system (meat + sides) as opposed to full, composed, this-is-all-you'll-need plates?Anywho, price hypothesizing aside: the stand-out from the group was the fried chicken and croissant waffle. The croissant waffle is exactly as you'd expect: it tastes like a perfectly griddled croissant and if it had been warm it would have been perfect. Flavour *on fleek*, however. The chicken atop was delicious; still very moist, and they nailed the seasoning. It had a scant drizzle of syrup atop, but was served with a side of gravy...southern-style, complete with \"bits\" (ham hock? Gizzards? Gee, I dunno, it was delicious). Gilding the lily: a sunny side up egg. Again, the plates just felt a little unfinished - literally, a waffle with a piece of chicken atop - but on this dish the taste limited the complaints.The reason for the 3 stars is really based on the fact that the portions aren't really large, and the price to me skewed high given what was/n't included. We went home to power up the Aeropress and make a snack #truestory.Yelp note: I know I have a few considerable grumbles about the food, but the space is beautiful, staff great, and I would absolutely return. Just maybe for drinks? Or dinner? Or...gah, I don't know...flashbacks to brunch still leave me frustrated. But #thatdrinksmenutho",

    "text": "A bit of a mixed bag at the sister restaurant of Hawksmoor.Many a foodie will be familiar with the legendary Hawksmoor. Whose amazing food and laid back experience keep you coming back for more.I've been to Foxlow twice and the first visit was stunning. Initially having no idea the place was part of the Hawksmoor group, upon finding out it all made sense. The food was excellent, staff great and the whole experience was well joined up.However the second visit was close to horrendous even with all the attempts of the staff to make it up. This review will cover both visits.On the first visit all the food we ordered was great. In particular the Tamworth spare ribs were excellent and a must recommend. They literally melted in the mouth. On the second visit there were issues will everything. The spare ribs were tough, the squid was chewy and in a million tiny pieces. The meatballs underwhelming. Oh and it took about 20 mins to get 80% of our starters, then about 15 mins more to get the squid as \"the chef wasn't happy with it\". They did say they'd take the squid off the bill though.After starters were collected, we were left waiting about 45 mins for our main courses. I guess they wanted to deliver them all at the same time. There were 6 of us on the table. But again, the chef didn't appear to be happy with the chicken this time, the reason given for why it was taking so long. Eventually we got all the food which was good but a little lacking. The chicken I ordered was cooked, but a little on the rubbery side. My colleague who ordered the Fried Chicken had super rubbery chicken which was still a little bloody in the middle. Hmm. It looked cooked well enough, but it's clearly not of the Hawksmoor/Foxlow standard. At this point we'd been there about 2 hours which is quite a while and as apologies the staff kindly offered us a complimentary selection of random desserts. This was a nice touch and went some way to building up some goodwill. Particularly given as this was the best course of food we'd had. Sticky toffee pudding was diving, along with the lemon tart, apple crumble and chocolate mess. If only the rest was as good.The staff were extremely apologetic as they took payment. I have a feeling they had some staffing issues today in the kitchen.In all, if I had reviewed Foxlow after my first visit it would have scored the best possible. However given all the issues on the second visit I think 4 stars is generous. However I believe this visit was an outlier, and hope this venue can regain it's form on a future visit.Worth the try if you're looking for something new, but if you need something solid bear in mind there are plenty of other restaurant options in the area.",

We sat at a high top counter near the bar where we could watch both fellow dinners and the kitchen staff - neither of which failed to amuse. We'd come come back in a heartbeat. To top things of, our wonderful Italian server shared some of her awesome homemade limoncello with us. Magnifico!!!",

They have legit hot sauce which I've missed so much since moving here from the States!Hub had steak and eggs and avocado which was fresh, delicious, and hit the spot!Ambiance is great, we'll be back!",

    "text": "I really wanted to love Foxlow. I really did. I went for a Sunday brunch - we only waited 10 mins to get a table which was lucky because it was packed! The food was okay I guess...I ordered the chicken and waffles and maybe it's partly my fault for not asking questions but when I think of chicken and waffles, I think of delicious tender fried chicken, a sweet waffle and maple syrup.I got 1 and a half of that. Delicious tender fried chicken - check. Sweet waffle - half check. It was a croissant waffle but I could live with that.But! The maple syrup was missing!!! Instead I got a little jug of gravy with bits of something of a meaty consistency in it. Okay, it wasn't gross but it wasn't sweet and maple-y! I also got a fried egg. That made me feel a bit better.But I couldn't help feeling a tad disappointed. Service is friendly they give you enough time to look at the menu and don't rush at all - although when they took my friends coat they didn't really explain what that green ticket was for. I nearly left it at the bar. From the look of the other dishes on the menu, I think I'll give Foxlow another chance but sadly won't be ordering chicken and waffles.",
