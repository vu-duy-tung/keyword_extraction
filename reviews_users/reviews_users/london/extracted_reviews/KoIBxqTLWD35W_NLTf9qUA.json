    "text": "A slightly bizzare meal last night at Canteen. The front of house were really welcoming and found us a nice, comfortable table, the waitress was really nice and helpful - but I really don't get the point of the food. It's such simple stuff, you'd think they'd manage to perfect the art of doing it really well - especially at such an apparently popular venue. But it was all, well, so underwhelming. I had been intending to order a pumpkin and goats cheese tart, but luckily the waitress showed it to me in the display case - it looked very pale, limp and uninspiring. I switched to fishcakes, which were OK, although it was really hard to tell what fish they'd actually used. Mushy peas were rather vinegary. My friend's macaroni cheese was fine, but a pretty meagre portion. For dessert I ordered an apple and blackberry crumble. The crumble topping was fantastic, really crunchy and packed with hazel nuts - but the fruit was a completely homogeneous mush, which managed to taste neither of blackberry or apple. Not inedible, just a bit, well, odd. I wasn't expecting spectacular food, but seriously they could do a LOT better.",

Especially recommend the Welsh rarebit, the pear and almond tart and the scones with cream. They don't always bring you enough cream and are not always great about letting you have takeaway for what's left. Worse, the service is VERY spotty probably because the 12.5 per cent tip is built into your bill so they're getting a tip no matter what the service. Still, it's a sweet and friendly place, what's good is great, and the whole family likes it. One other oddity--tey only take 30 per cent reservations--for the rest you have to chance it, so by all means book early if you can!",

We struggled to find the place but luckily with my smartphone on the case we were heading in the right direction. While walking there I thought I better have a look and see if this place was any good, and stumbled across a Jay Rayner article, admittedly for one of the other branches but given that they had the same name and therefore (in my mind at the time) had the same menu, I had a look at his recommendations. It was all going well until I read what he had to start - devilled kidneys on toast. I'd never had kidneys before and was a bit apprehensive, but if the devilled kidneys here are anything to go by, I've missed out big time. They were fantastic, soft and tasty in a lovely thick sauce. My pie and mash for main was brilliant, with crisp pastry and lots of filling, and my pudding was equally good (though thankfully not equally meaty!). Service was not excellent, but still good and overall a brilliant meal that we all enjoyed. I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of the other options on the menu, I hope they won't disappoint!",

    "text": "Canteen gets one star from me solely for stocking a really good hot ginger beer.But the rest was an absolute crapshoot.First, they sat us in a table that only had seats on one side, so we sat next to each other, facing into the restaurant.Our Welsh rarebit starter was not horrific, but it did not leave us with much sense of anticipation of what was to come. When it eventually did come that is.The place was hardly full... maybe 5-6 tables. And they had about the same number of wait-staff working. Well, they were THERE, but seemed more interested in chatting to each other than actually, you know, waiting tables.When my Shepherd's Pie arrived, it looked pretty good, served in a little metal skillet. So I picked up my fork and started digging into the potato crust to get down to the meaty goodness. First forkload was all potato so I dived back in again, a bit deeper this time. Nada. Again - and I am practically up to my elbows deep in potato this time, and I hit the bottom of the skillet and get some trace of something proteinish, accompanied by a pea.After a little further excavation work, I managed to clear a little bit of the plate to get a look at the profile - only to find two inches of potato piled on top of less than half an inch of meat mixed with peas. The meat layer was literally not even deep enough to cover the peas.My partner's chicken pie was pretty ordinary as well. Same issue. The chicken seemed to be out for the day.Having raised the lack of meat in my pie (which was really a lot more of a side serve of mashed potato, served as a main meal) she offered to have them \"cook me another one maybe, but it might take some time\". Her attitude definitely suggested that it might come with a little \"extra seasoning\" so I opted to decline.She ran to every other waitress and the service manager in the place to complain about my complaining (\"can you believe he expected some lamb in the Shepherd's Pie?!? OMG\") and then they all refused to come to our table or give any eye contact until I practically had to physically stop someone to get our check.15 minutes later once they finally took my card and charged the check, this miserable experience was finally over with.I didn't walk into this place expecting fine dining, but this joint couldn't even get the basics right.Bad food. Bad attitude. Bad service. Therefore... bad review.",

Before we ate we had a drink at the bar. I had a Seasonal G & T (the gin is infused with rhubarb) which was lovely. To eat I had chicken and chips which whilst well done, was unremarkable.

The leek and potato soup was very tasty and a good-sized portion (5.50 pounds). The smoked haddock (13.75 pounds) was quite good and very healthy--served along with sauteed spinach (which was a tad oily) and small bit of mash. Wouldn't have complained had they put a tad more mash on the plate--the portion seemed just a tad larger than a tablespoon full. Finished with the chocolate beetroot cake which was fine (3 pounds). The service was very attentive. Wouldn't make this a special night out, but when I'm in the mood for a decent meal, I do consider Canteen. I enjoyed the location out at Canary Wharf more, but still worth a trip.",

    "text": "Sometimes a long leisurely meal is not what you want. Sometimes you need to get in and out like a viking raid (minus the raping and pillaging of course). It's amazing the way a need for quality food at speed reduces your choice. Unless of course you go down the sarnie and drink route \u00a0a quick Pret, an Eat or, god fobid, a Greggs style abberation. But there is a third way. The Canteen way. Canteen isn't the place for a long dinner with many courses, while the emphasis is modern British food, it's not St Johns or Rules. It highlights on the menu the dishes that come quickest out of the kitchen for goodness sake. But it also highlights that everything is made in those very kitchens, from the buttered Arbroath smokies to the piccalilli. No special sauce or Heinz mayo here. No siree. So I don't mind sharing a 6 person table with two other couples, I don't mind the odd average dish, because you know what? It's a damn site better than anything else you can get nearby at the same speed. It's a bit like the calculation I made as a wayward teen, applying some fiendish algorithm to determine which wine brought most alcoholic bang for my (minimal) buck. Here it's the small dishes that deliver on the bang-for-your-buck scale. I went straight for devilled kidneys on toast with a side of chips and some spring greens. The kidneys were great. Properly meaty without that bitter edge you can get if they're not absolutely fresh. The texture was firm but not chewy and they put just the right amount of cayenne kick into the sauce. They came perched on a delightfully tangy, stretchy piece of toast that lent a certain crunch to the affair. Greens were fresh and tasty and the chips were decent. My friend went for the roast chicken and I was surprised both at how good it tasted \u00a0juicy, darkly meaty and distinctly free range \u00a0and the size. This was no stunted teen (or accelerated toddler) this was a properly matured fowl. The skin was properly crisped too. Delicious. And the whole lot, including 2 caraffs of wine and a pint of Meantime IPA came to something under \u00a340. I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could.",

The place has a very modern feel to it - we were very impressed by a beautiful wood structure positioned in the plaza; however, this is part of a design festival and has nothing to do with the restaurant.The first disappointment was the wine list at the bar. They seem to be trying too hard to be different. Why else would you offer a choice of three rose wines which includes an American, a British (!?) and a Spanish variety. We selected the latter but kept wondering why there wasn't a more obvious French or Italian on offer.The second disappointment was to be offered a seat right in the corner, by a broken door. But the worst disappointment was the food. After the initial excitement of a delicious sounding and very extensive menu of unusual and more predictable comfort food, we were taken aback a little by the speed with which our food arrived.One out of three was actually hot, one luke warm, the other cold. Cold comford food is just not right, and we felt a bit insulted as the place isn't cheap.It contradicts the Canteen claim of being committed to providing honest food, nationally sourced, skilfully prepared and reasonably priced.

    "text": "Modern British food, made in house. Yes that's right in house. It is a chain yet it still feels family run which is nice. It is a Coeliac's dream as you can ask the front of house mgr what is in what dish and they know as they create it themselves from scratch! We visited last year and saw a great FOH mgr who had a notebook packed with GF options. Visited again this year and the guy had left so service was a little patchy. However, we can recommend that if you need a great long slow sunday lunch to blow away the cobwebs of a wild night before - then this is it. Perched on the South Bank you can sit outside and watch the world saunter by or dine inside. We opted for the latter. It has a quirky design, very minimalist so that you almost feel you're in a library that just happens to offer great food. The wine list is amazing although a tad pricey as this is the South Bank. We ate the buttered Arbroath smokie and had roast chicken or was it duck (?) for main with great greens. Note: the Smokie is billed as a starter yet is huge so come hungry! The staff were friendly and very open to adapting dishes to make them gluten free. It's a great choice for a lazy Sunday meal with a partner or friends that are visiting the city and want to see the South Bank. Do watch the price. Dishes quickly add up and they add 12.5% service charge to your bill. So more a place for an occassional than regular gluten free bite. If you take a date there you can wind up the evening by wandering over to Skylon for some great gluten free cocktails and soaking up the sunset over the river Thames!",

Service was pretty slow: almost 90 minutes for mains. The devilled kidneys had the wrong proportions. Very meagre slice of toast (which disintegrates into mush in the sauce) with four kidneys. The mushrooms with duck egg looked far better. The chicken and mash was fine but bland. The braised red cabbage was a bit sweet, with no vinegar to cut through. Had to load it all with pepper and salt to have much flavour. My friend who had the salmon salad initially turned hers away because there was so little salmon to be seen and it was described by the waitress as salad with avocado. My friend only ate half of it, as she also didn't find it very flavourful, despite it having a chilli dressing.",

    "text": "I visited Canteen's Royal Festival Hall location on Sunday the 24 May 2015 in a group of eight people. I have previously eaten at this location and struggled to get a big group into the restaurant without a reservation, but it was easy to make one online a few days in advance.. The food at Canteen is ideal for groups of all ages as they offer children's portions of any dish at half price and the selection consists of traditional British fare with rotating daily and monthly specials. The menu features homemade pies, fish and chips, macaroni and cheese and all day brunch dishes- they boast fresh ingredients and all of our dishes were vibrant, immaculately arranged on the plate and good portion sizes. The homemade pies were the envy of all diners in the group, as these came out with a nice flaky crust, generous filling, hand cut fries, a small jug of gravy and lightly saut\u00e9ed seasonal greens. The macaroni and cheese offered a mature spin on the classic, delivering a creamy, rich cheese sauce and decorated with an arrangement of bacon strips balanced on top. The fish and chips represented a nice attempt at the quintessential dish and were lightly battered with a crispy coating, accompanied with hand cut fries. My hot trout salad was a solid option for a light lunch with flakes of perfectly smoked fish on a bed of lightly dressed apple, fennel and salad leaves.The food at Canteen definitely delivers, but we had several issues with the speed and care of service and the facilities in the restaurant itself- the ladies toilets were backed up and a complete mess when we first arrived. They were then closed, leaving women queuing for the handicap stall, which also quickly became a mess because the hand dryer was out of order and there were discarded tissues and hand towels piling up. In addition to this, it took the waiting staff much too long to clear our dishes when we were finished our meal. When our plates were eventually collected, they were merely put aside on an empty table and some remained there for the duration of our visit. However, we did arrange for some Birthday cupcakes to be brought over the table and management happily obliged with this request.As Canteen's food is equivalent to a relatively high end gastropub in terms of its presentation, portion size, assembly and pricing, I would expect more attentive service and cleaner facilities generally, however this is a general comment that likely applies to all restaurants along the Southbank because of the footfall in this area- in particular, staff always appear to be overladen, distracted and frazzled in these tourist hotspots. I would recommend Canteen as a good spot for fresh, hearty British food if you are visiting the Southbank as they do offer good value in comparison to other generic food franchises in the area, but otherwise, it might be advisable to try one of their alternative locations for a more intimate and enjoyable atmosphere.",

While Canteen isn't quite 'the one' for me, it certainly is, ahem, worth another visit... and often. My servers were anything but aloof and by the end of my 3-hour coffee-turned-work-station-turned-lunch meeting, I knew most of them by name. The venue itself is nice and airy with plenty of window seating, communal tables, 2-tops and even a rather comfortable bar. Plus there's free wifi. I would highly recommend this as a central meeting point - my tablemate was making a skype call to Singapore and apparently the connection was a-ok for that! The one star off is for the prices which I do feel are a tad high. An 8oz black coffee cost me \u00a32.25 and lunch specials hovered around the \u00a314 mark, some of which did not include any sides at all. (I'm lookin' at you whole grilled Plaice!) However for a coffee and a meeting, Canteen is a great spot and will certainly be my business friend-with-benefits whenever I'm in the neighbourhood.",

I assume its targeted to the West London group of people, John Lewis and Waitrose shoppers.The food has been consistently decent, albeit with a lightly pinched price tag. I've experienced a few other branches around and this one wasn't up to the expected standard.It was packed during Saturday lunchtime, but we managed to get a booth for two within a few minutes. Sat down, got us the wine and things became easier onwards.Effectively we ordered food and we begun to wait. 20 minutes later and the waiter informs us there's a small delay as the kitchen is extremely busy. Another glass of wine down, we're both mellower and we're still waiting. We're now 45 minutes post-order. Surprise surprise, food arriving.Sorry Canteen, you failed me. My sausages and mash were boring. I was bored halfway but I had to eat cause the alcohol made me hungry. It was sad. I pulled a rather sad face as I finished up. I noticed the plate was hot - could it be that Canteen, a purveyor of fresh food, all home-made has actually microwaved my food? I couldn't really tell but it didn't taste as fresh as I remember it being at the Canary Wharf branch. The sausages were tough, not seasoned and generally tasteless. Like I've bought Richmond sausages from the supermarket. The mash tasted like it had been made by potatoes rather than that sachet my local tescos sells.I've had some of my friends chicken. It's chicken. It was OK. No seasoning and really light on the flavour. Nothing spectacular. I don't get the fuss about it anymore. The crowd that goes there likes it, obviously as every branch is packed daily. But I'm over Canteen and I'm not sure whether I'll ever return.",
