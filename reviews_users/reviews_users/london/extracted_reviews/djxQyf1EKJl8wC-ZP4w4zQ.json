I think that you definitely pay for the location, and I wouldn't hurry back for the food.",

We had booked the table much in advance however, we had to wait on the balcony for a table to become vacant but it was a lovely view! The warm weather was inviting and we ordered a cocktail each and before we knew it, our table was ready. The restaurant itself is quite classy to look at with tables and booths. The biggest disappointment was the food. With the set menu, we were very limited to what to order as none of it was very appealing especially at those sky high prices! Each course only had 3 or 4 options with one of them also being unavailable at the time. The portions are incredibly small.The staff were friendly but I didn't leave feeling satisfied and full.. no surprise then we went to another restaurant afterwards for more food! Also, the gardens were closed for a private event so we were unable to see them. Doubt I'll be visiting again as it's such a long way away which is a shame.It was quite a disappointing experience and I recommend you visit for drinks or tea.",

The best part was the amazing bread tray that came out which had hot lovely rolls. \u00a0 The service was spotty, the price tag was big, the atmosphere was pretentious and clubby, so I wasn't all that impressed. \u00a0Having eaten in the restaurant we were able to go to the club downstairs, but it wasn't so impressive. \u00a0Young, international and wannabees all around! \u00a0I think there are just better places to spend your money in London, but if you do invest here, you'll be just fine.",

I must say the cocktail was pretty good and went down very well so hopes where high for the rest to come. Howeveqr I was quite disappointed with the food. It was good but definitely not as exceptional as it tried to be. You just can't serve bitter avocado or tough lamb with tinned beans. The dessert was taken off the bill as I got a bad piece of pineapple - which as well is not acceptable if the price is high. So you might ask why I gave it 3 stars?well the location was beautiful the interior pretty and the cocktails amazing. I would say. Go for that instead of the food and head somewhere else if you get hungry.",

The meal started off great - had the goat's cheese starter, which are fried balls of goat's cheese with some rocket and a beetroot/apple puree. It was delicious! Then onto the main course, for which I had the braised beef daube. Sounded great on the menu, but came out and was dry and almost inedible. The mash potato around the plate was good, nice and creamy, but that can't make up for the fact that the beef was not good. I expect braised beef to be tender. The crushed sweet potato side dish was yummy, but the avocado topped with chilli salsa was a let down - the avocado wasn't ripe. Lastly, for dessert had the treacle pudding. It was not really what I had expected, not bad but not great either. Not enough to leave a good impression for me.",

We waited 45 minutes to receive our starters and then there was a 30 minute break between the starters and the main course.My poor rating relates only to the slow service.

For the starter I had the vegetarian pea soup. \u00a0When I asked if I could get it without the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche the waiter didn't even bat an eye and said \"of course!\". \u00a0It was absolutely delicious, so much so I practically ignored my lunch meeting, I might have even made slurpy noises. \u00a0 For my main I had the Roasted Chicken Supreme With sweet corn puree and grilled spring onion. \u00a0It was just the right amount, beautifully presented and wasn't drenched in gravy which made me feel like I got a healthy lunch out of the deal. \u00a0Win! \u00a0The service was impeccable, everyone was smiling, and you actually might have thought they enjoyed their job! \u00a0The food was great too! \u00a0We've been trying to get in for a sunday brunch here but its always booked! \u00a0I will be back and have already recommended it to friends! \u00a0You should go too.",

It was a bit cold today but I can imagine that on a nice day it would be pretty awesome.The restaurant decor and atmosphere is quite nice. I love the aquarium in the toilet separating the ladies and the gents. I could actually see my girlfriend through it. Funny. And the staff is very friendly. The food is quite average. That's quite a disappointment. Specially when looking at the prices. My starter was nice (the salmon), but my main was tasteless (the duck) and my dessert was not very exciting. It lacks creativity & seasoning. You can definitively find a better for cheaper. But I guess you pay the location.Go and enjoy a cocktail, but skip the dinner ;))",

If I hadn't had such great company then the evening would have been disappointing (the pigeon starter didn't do it for either of us, although the main (duck) and desert (pear icecream thing) was nice. The interiour surroundings are nice and the bar is cosy, (Molton Brown in the Ladies - always a good sign). All in all, a nice evening but shame about the gardens.

Reception didn't seem terribly organised, and on arrival guests were corralled into a strange, small bar area: sunken, with benches around the edges and only one entrance, it felt more like a holding pen than a good place to enjoy a cocktail. The meal did nothing to redeem the experience. Three small rolls (all different) seemed an odd thing to give two diners - not exactly designed for sharing; the accompanying butter was incredibly salty. Food was sometimes fine (not good, not bad) but often disappointing: one starter wasn't properly cooked, while a main course was over-generous with a rather monotonous slab of meat yet downright stingy with the couple of tiny carrots huddled against a lump of unseasoned mashed potato (no salt, no milk, no butter). The cheeses were good but their selection unbalanced. Service was pleasant but could not make up for the disappointing food, or the very high wine prices. A very disappointing meal.",

What they mean, is the gardens, one floor below the restaurant- which you can't actually see from any of the restaurant tables, and on the weekends have to pay extra to go out and see the gardens. Ok, fine. Well, disappointed by the view we set out to enjoy the food and drinks instead. We had originally had a reservation for 3, I called a few days earlier and asked if we could have a space for 4 because a colleague was going to join us for a drink, but wouldn't be able to stay for dinner. I was told no problem. We all arrived and were greeted nicely and seated promptly. We ordered drinks, and before they were delivered the waiter asked for our order the first time. I explained that we wanted to have one round of drinks first before we ordered. The drinks arrived, but after another 5 minutes, the waiter was back asking for our order. I again told him we wanted to wait until our colleague left. He insisted that we must order, but said he would hold the courses until it was just the 3 of us who were eating, so we relented and ordered. 5 minutes later, the starters showed up before our colleague had left. The waiter was very inflexible and seemed to be rushing us out of the table all night, a very odd thing in London. I had white tomato soup and risotto, both were delicious. One of my other colleagues did not care for her starter, but we were happy to pay for it, and the Maitre d' came and removed it from the check without our asking, so that was nice. Overall, it was 70 GBP a piece for 2 drinks, a starter and a main - not great value, especially for what you get, and especially for poor service. I would not recommend this restaurant at all and will not be going back.",

Upon entering the building which is just off the Kensington High Street (by Debenhams) you go through double doors as if entering an office block and the security will take to to the lift and send you up to the top floor. It is all very exclusive and feels as if your entering a secret location. Once you get to the top floor the host will take your jackets and show you to the seated area which is a sunken area surrounded by fish tanks and beautiful tropical fish. The restaurant is to your right and have a terrace area further to your right again. The terrace has amazing views over london, however we went on a cold October night and couldn't see much in the darkness ! The food was lovely, but quite pricey, a starter starting at \u00a39 and a main starting at \u00a316, wine also started at approx \u00a317 per bottle. We ate our meal and then went to the club set below the restaurant which was really good, a mix of funky house and pop but not too cheesy. There was also a garden with a bar set in the middle.

All of the allergens are listed next to the dishes which I find so helpful and much easier than asking for an allergen menu and being handed a folder of plastic wallets. I asked if they could alter both my starter and my main to not contain dairy, they were more than happy to and the chef made me an alternative sauce for my fish rather than just serve it plain like many other restaurants. I had a delicious and elegantly served cocktail called Mint to be with blackberries and peppermint, I strongly recommend! After eating we sat out on the terrace enjoying our cocktails and watching the flamingoes in the garden below. I would definitely come back again on a sunnier day to enjoy a drink and the view from the terrace.

It's called Babylon because it's suppose to resemble the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and it literally does. I went there when it was freezing outside, so I didn't get to enjoy the gardens to their full potential, but even still, the setting and scenery were absolutely beautiful. When you walk inside, you'll feel like you're in a palace in Ancient Greece or something. They also have great private rooms to throw events or corporate functions. It's a super sexy place for a date though. That's probably the ideal occasion for this place.Location - A 3 minute walk from High Street Kensington Station. Very convenient and located right next to all the music headquarters. OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH:Price Options - I know this is meant to be more high end, but even high end places usually have happy hours or specials at certain time. \u00a312 for a Kir Royal just seems a bit ridiculous if I'm getting Prosecco quality bubbly.Food - The food I tried was okay, but I think it was a bit over-priced, especially for the incredibly small portion sizes.Service - I honestly can't remember much about it, good or bad. The host was nice though. She readily charged my phone for me throughout our meal, which was a huge help.",

We never found out due to a private party in the gardens so had to content ourselves with the restaurant. The scene embodied much of what least appeals to me about living in Kensington - crusty, unexciting people of the landed gentry class and their wanna-be hangers on. Yes, Kensington is beautiful but I spend most of my funtime in Shoreditch. So no gardens. The service, however, was of the impeccable class, the starters mostly brilliant (I was a huge fan of the Golden Egg...try it out) but the main of Pork Collar was uninspiring despite being aesthetically appealing. Puddings all round were delish. Ultimately though, if you purge the garden, much better food can be found elsewhere for less dosh.End game for me is I won't be going back. Was hoping for a dining scene more like i would find in my old home of LA - cutting edge, chic, glam. Babylon is none of these things.",

As 'Becky' had always been a good 'source' wink, wink say no more, I was all ears. 'Babylon at High Noon' she said. 'Kensington,' and she did a cellular cut-off leaving me hanging. Just as I imagine those ancient gardens were.I tossed up whether I might have to go and look at Churchill's 'enigma de-coding machine' in the War Museum or think out side of the box as to her whispered coded instructions. The latter won. Phone book in red public phone box provided the answer. Restaurant/Bar in Kensington...silly me. I was never meant for Her Majesty's Intelligence Service.Knowing 'Techy B.' would have booked the best table. God knows what she has to do to get into these places and always 'corner' the best seats - at the blink of an eye - has always bemused me - however, I think I won't ask. Needless to say, when I got there 'Becky' was on the Rooftop garden area waiting. A great view of west London.Even though the view and the garden were awesome, as was the information I got...which as always, cost me the pretty price of the meal and a hot Tip for the Royal Ascot meeting. Which, by the way, was not gentle on my purse at \u00a335 quid a head...without the wine. Merely enough to keep a 102 Lb weakling like myself alive till dinner-time. Frankly, it was over-priced considering the entr\u00e9e - mine was goats cheese and beetroot with apple pur\u00e9e - which tasted as though it was made from an 18 year old Goat after it became a cadaver.While my lips were parched for the wine I ordered, it only arrived after I had started to hoe into my Duck a la 'Main.' When I started to complain about my wine withdrawal symptoms, the beaming smile from the friendly waiter along with his 'we are awfully busy' look made my mouth water far more than the hot duck which was in actual truth 'a rather coldish duck.'\"Nice place this,\" boasted 'Becky. \"I come here a lot.\"\"Delightful view,\" I gasped back, hiding the snarl with my half glass of Australian Shiraz. One day I'll work out why a glass of wine often arrives as only a half a glass. Although, I imagine it's out of pure consideration by the management for those who so easily spill it on their clothes. I can't think of any other possible motive.The Kensington upmarket area, and the view probably justify the price tag. So, one star for the view and location, the other for the nice drink waiter who, by the way, gave me a wink and the other for the hastily prepared tasteless lunch. If a half a star was available then the 'Australian Shiraz' would get it.",

He reserved a table beforehand, and good thing too as it was busy on that Friday night. The restaurant is a little tricky to find. It's located on the 6th (or 7th, I can't remember which) floor of a building on a side ride close to high street ken station. On entering the building, you're met with a bouncer with a clipboard (WTF?) and then taken to the lifts up to the restaurant.The restaurant was modern chic and fairly large in size. We were seated by the window, which had a balcony outside for drinks. The customer service was just right... I mean, don't you just hate it when the waiters/waitresses hover over you every 5 minuets? For food, I ordered steak for my main. It looked small but don't be fooled, it ended up filling me right up!After dinner, we were allowed access to the club on the floor below. It was a really nice club and worth checking out if you're with your mates. Downside: tad pricey for our (or rather his) pockets =(",

    "text": "Like the city of old, Babylon stands towering over London as an example of civilisation. And as it's namesake did, the building stretches up past its neighbours to reach for the heavens. Although in London, this feat only requires 6 or 7 floors.Babylon is the bar/restaurant located on the 7th floor of a building just around the corner from Whole Foods Kensington. The fairly non-descript entrance can be hard to miss although the hulking bouncer in front isn't. On most evenings, you will need a reservation just to get in and if trying to get to Kensington Rooftop Gardens Club (6th floor and part of the restaurant complex), you better be on the guest list or have Sir Branson on speed dial.I should add a disclaimer that as one of my close friends works at Babylon, I've always had a great time there thanks to him. That being said, from my previous experiences at the club (before he started) and my observation of other patrons, this is a place that really focuses on providing a delightful and relaxing time for all of its guests. My latest visit was on one of the rare sunny days London has graciously provided to give a semblance of summer. After taking my time to peruse the extensive cocktail menu, I finally found myself with a cool drink in hand and sat back to enjoy the lingering rays. Some light jazz from the live band filtered through the speakers, perfectly balanced to allow for conversation while covering up any awkward silences. We pushed our dinner reservation back to 9pm and ordered a scallop appetiser from the terrace seafood bar.This bar is pretty awesome with a massive assortment of seafood (mainly shellfish and prawns although I reckon you can get some sashimi or ceviche if you ask nicely) on display. They have a limited stock so once it sells out then they are done for the day. While it may be disappointing if you get there late, at least you know it's fresh! Our scallop taster was delicious with tender scallops bursting with sweetness and served in the shell (which I've always thought added an excellent artistic touch to the presentation).Finally, we gave up on the dying sunlight and settled inside for dinner. I started off with a Summer Truffle Risotto that was tender and creamy but maintained a delicateness I can only hope to recreate at home. The truffle (surprisingly not my favourite item) did a great job enhancing the flavour of the dish without trying to steal centre stage.My Roast Pork Fillet main was tasty and a good mix of textures from the succulent pork, crunchy veggies, and velvety spatzle. I would have liked some more of the sauce as the pork was a tad dry for my tastes but a minor point.For dessert, we were treated to a display of liquid nitrogen cooking as an alcoholic sorbet was whipped up in seconds using a recipe similar to a margarita than was then doused in that iciest of liquids. From the billowing steam, a set of frosted glasses appeared with our delightful desserts. The coldness of the sorbet enhanced the crispness of the flavours and was a perfect high note to end the rich meal. We had a bit of an extra treat with meringue dipped in the leftover liquid nitrogen. If you dip it in and then place it into your mouth, each word you speak is accompanied by a puff of smoke. We were having far too much fun and the table next to us insisted on joining in and one lady put us to shame with a truly excellent display of smoke rings.Overall, a great night of food and drink in an unbeatable surrounding. The live jazz (every Tuesday) was a great touch and one I'd missed from my time back in Boston. The place isn't cheap (cocktails are around \u00a310-12, mains \u00a325-30), but it's one of the few times I'd say it's worth it. Just make sure to go on a sunny day as it would be a shame not to experience the terrace and gardens.",

Bloody mary to start, which was good but needed more kick. Then Herring with beetroot and various other things, again this was nice but not amazing. I then had chicken roast dinner for my main course. The serving size was pretty stingy and the chicken was dry, to be honest I've cooked better roast chicken than this. We had a few side dishes of vegetables which were ok but the damage had already been done. I didn't bother with a dessert. Also, the lunch was for Gill's sister's birthday so she had arranged for a few petit fours and a candle to be brought to our table. This was arranged during the booking process and she both spoke to a member of staff to request this and had it confirmed by email. Disappointly this didn't show up at the expected time and still hadn't 45 minutes later despite asking various times so we just left. Although I wasn't involved in the booking process I understand from Gill that this had been pretty painful. She called on 3rd January to book a table for the 9th but the voicemail was still about New Years Eve. She booked online but in the special message section asked for someone to call her to talk about the above birthday surprise plan. There was no call, just various emails which (eventually) confirmed the birthday plans but they then failed to follow through with it. Also, when we arrived there was a drilling noise which the manager personally informed us would finish in 5 mins. The drilling was still happening when we sat down to the table and we had to ask several times for the drilling to be stopped. Quite poor overall.",

    "text": "It was fine - nothing amazing.Went here for London Restaurant Week so they had a set menu (starters were duck egg, goat cheese salad, and butternut squash soup - mains: pork belly, seabass, risotto - desserts: creme brule, praline bar, something else).Starters: Had the duck egg - wasn't runny in the middle or particularly tasty. Goat cheese salad was good, but standard. The bread they brought to the table was very good though.Mains: Seabass - OK, lacked a bit of flavor ie. salting but some bites had the right mix. Pork belly - this was really good. Melt in your mouth, truffle sauce, nice veg with it. Desserts: Creme Brulee was passionfruit or mango flavored - didn't love it. Praline bar was very very good though. Would have that again in a second. At the end of the day, it was pretty expensive for what I would put in the OK meal category. Don't think I'll be rushing back.",

    "text": "Disappointing.The evening started with our table not being ready, we didn't mind and were offered to take a seat outside for drinks. This was in December, so the temperature was low but the heaters and blsnkets provided soon aided in our frozen toes thawing, what did not help was the aggressive gale blowing which is not the establishments fault but being forgotten by the staff is... We were sat outside for 20 minutes before the young chap took our drinks order, the co entails when they arrived weren't overly inspiring and pricey for what you got.After a further 15 minutes we had to ask if our table was ready, thankfully it was. Still in good spirits and glad to be in the warm we took our seat in a booth along the back wall - I'd recommend requesting a booth if you do visit.The setting was lovely but the food not great, no flavour, average quality, just blah. Presentation was good, but what is the point if there is no taste?Would recommend visiting for a client lunch where food is not the focus, but setting needs to impress and you don't mind the meal going cold over long talks.",
