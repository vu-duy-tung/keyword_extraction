It's always busy, which is a sign of good food, but can get irritating if you just wanna pay and go. There is also a sit in area if you just want to relax and read the newspaper :)",

It was mostly hard batter (which I had difficulty getting my fork through) on my plate and tiny bits of cod-not a good solid fillet as I am used to. Well cooked and the portions were very, very generous which was great because I was absolutely starving!! but the food was tasteless including the lifeless salad and the insipid soup.You wouldn't think they were an old hand at this dish, although, so many of these glorified chippies change management then the quality diminishes, sadly. I always try anything once, especially where food is concerned but I won't be returning. There are far more superior fish restaurants in London.",

I had a takeaway and started munching on them just outside. Half way through my bag, I saw a celebrity walk past me and go in, not Britney Spears, nor anyone too famous, I think he presents 'have I got news for you'. Anyways, when he walked in, I thought to myself, this must be a well known place.That day I went home and looked forward to telling the family about this new place I discovered, called Toffs. When I did finally tell them, they had already knew of it and had been going there for years, in fact, we use to take walks around Muswell Hill and treat ourselves to fish and chips there. How weird.I have been going ever since and must visit around twice a month. They have a traditional seating area and it is usually packed. It is also award winning and has been around since the 60's, it is now owned and run by a Greek family and I absolutely love it. They do have a few other things on the menu, like grilled chicken but I couldn't really tell you about that as I haven't tried it before and doubt I ever will. Eating chicken at Toffs is like eating a salad in a sweetshop. \u00a0It's all about the fish and Chips at Toffs!! Go!",

(And if you're a rutting pig such as myself, you may find yourself from time to time indulging in pies.)The stogy chips cannot be described, they are that delicious.The cole slaw is extremely tasty.And the desserts, which you won't have room for, are out. of. this. world.

I've never eaten in as being a Northerner I like mine wrapped up and taken back to the comfort of my own hobbit hole, and it would just feel a bit weird eating fish 'n' chips off a plate and not from a piece of paper that you're worried will leave a greasy stain on your couch arm/lap/table (hey it's all part of the fun) but the restaurant does look nice.You do have to be a bit of a toff to eat here though as it's very expensive (by 'eck we're not in Yorkshire now love) but it beats any other chippy down here so I'm prepared to pay the price. One great little thing is that they will do you a grilled fish if you're on a diet, but the batter's so light and crispy that I seriously recommend you don't miss it.

Had two cans of coke. Breaking it down:1. Battered vs Grilled - Grilled is the WINNER! It was so tasty, flavour was beautiful, fish was light. \u00a0I will struggle to eat battered fish again. \u00a0Also, I didn't really like the batter on the fish - it was was a bit stodgy rather than light.2. Chips - outstanding. I've been on the look out for a chip shop that hits the spot since my youth in Coventry where 'Cooper's Fish Bar' on Gulson Road was awesome. \u00a0Toff's chips and just awesome.3. Atmosphere - Vibrant, friendly and full of all mix of people. Staff are friendly and have personality.4. Cost - its twice the cost of take-away (\u00a330) but if you are going to enjoy the grilled fish, you can't take it away, so worth every penny.If you are in the area then go to Toff's - it's awesome.",

Then there are new alternative fish types. \u00a0Cornish Pollock, North Sea Whiting. er NO. \u00a0It is time to embrace these alternative white fish types to preserve stocks. \u00a0They could be a lot cheaper out of the fryer,offering a modest portion of fish and a small chips for under a fiver. Time to CHANGE THE FISH! Which brings me back to prices. \u00a0Toffs is very expensive for those on a low income. I cannot afford regular cod and chips at Toffs at \u00a38 a throw. \u00a0Particularly as at Stroud Green, the new CHIPPY, that's its name, does a fish supper for \u00a34.50. \u00a0And it is a good fresh small Cod and medium Chips.So Still a Good product, but NOT value for money.

The portion sizes are massive the cod literally falls off the sides of your plate. The chips are crisp and chunky! Service is lovely you can always see the owner walking around and talking to the customers. Really one of my favourite places :)",

If you haven't tried this place you should. You are unlikely to be disappointed.",

    "text": "Hate to have to leave a bad review here but given the circumstances of what it took for me to finally get here, I feel obligated. I happen to watch a special on Food Paradise London and TOFFS was featured. I keep a diary of places it eat and this made the list. Did I mention that I saw this special maybe 2 years ago. Well I finally made it to London so was very excited when I knew I would make it there. One of my best friends is from Newcastle and lives in Brixton. For the last few days, he suggested several places and of course, I said no. So we set out on a journey. And when I say journey, I really mean it. We started off by heading to Castle. Since we are heading out to Scotland tomorrow, this was my last chance to do this. So we hopped on the train and it went as follows - 1 stop change, 1 stop change, 7 stops change, 11 stops change, then a slight walk to the bus stop and 5 stops. So we arrived and I was thrilled!!! \u00a0It was quite slow when we walked in. My excitement may have been much for them as I felt the need to tell them I travelled all the way from Miami FL to try the Fish n Chips. When we ordered, they were taken from the display rack and right then and there I got a little nervous as I just assumed it would be fresh and crispy. Fries were grabbed in another area in which they have been sitting there as well. So there goes freshness. But still, maybe their batter withstands the air and maintains the crispiness or maybe I was just optimistic in thinking they would not serve anything that was not up to par. We ordered to go and walked a few blocks to a park to eat as the weather was delightful. What a huge, and I mean HUGE disappointment!!! \u00a0Cold, soggy, dry. And that was for the Fish and the Chips... \u00a0If after reading this review you decide to still go, I would highly suggest you demand it be made to order. Oh well... \u00a0My friend told me not to worry as we will find some great places for Fish n Chips when we set out for Scotland....",

It's slightly more expensive if you dine in but once in a while, it's worth it for the lovely experience. The staff are incredibly friendly and you can tell lots of locals frequent there by the conversation and banter! You also get unlimited chips :)If fried isn't your thing, they also do a roast fish which looked fantastic. The puddings are traditional and look luscious. The fish and chips were so filling I never got to dessert but the ones my neighbours had looked fantastic.It's going to be dangerous that this is now my local fish and chip shop! I've already been back for a few cheeky cod and chips :)",

It is far from being glamorous or a place where I would take a girl for a first date, but the food is just terrific. I always have the haddock with chips and a side order of coleslaw... delicious. I think it could only be improved in the fish were fried on olive oil. I also like the friend calamari and the fried camembert (at least 900 calories per cubic inch!). It is a bit pricey, but it is always full. A couple of times I had to go somewhere else because there were no tables and the queue to order take-away was too long.",

Cutting to the chase, there is a wide variety of fresh fish. The cod and haddock are very good (what most people have) and the chips are good too. Can't help but feel it's hard to get this type of food wrong in all honesty but this place is good for a reason What make it worth a visit is it actually sit in as it's a nice cosy decor in a lovely neighbourhood. It's definitely considered posh on a comparative level to most but that's fine. I do like it as everything is properly fresh.",

    "text": "Have to say I've been blown away with the reviews I've read here about Toff's. Is there another 'secret' Toff's hidden in Muswell Hill where people are going to because the one I know in no way what so ever deserves the high ratings its getting. Closer scrutiny of the awards certificates/news articles plastered all over the place show a disturbingly high number that aren't exactly shall we say errrr.... \u00a0recent. Firstly I'm reviewing the take-away not the sit down restaurant. I have friends in Muswell Hill so am normally passing through a few times a week. Last night (a Saturday) I decided to get some supper on my way home it was about 6:30pm.On walking in the first thing that struck me was the large number of staff.... 6 or 7? far more than I would have expected to be needed to run the place even at full tilt. One of the things that I always see and always annoys me about Toff's is that on there website it says (and I quote) \"All orders are cooked to order\" yet I counted 23 yes! 23 portions of fish in the warmer. There was no way on earth that they'd all been ordered. The place was no more than 25% full with most people in the restaurant section already eating and me the only person in the take away. I always look when passing even if not buying and its the same.Prices are rather odd at Toff's as a take away fish and chips is \u00a37.90 yet the restaurant only charges \u00a311.95. So after adding VAT eating in is only a couple of quid more expensive. Are those taking away subsidising the restaurant?I ordered a large cod with a regular chips. The Cod came in at a WHOPPING \u00a37.90 the chips a more reasonable \u00a31.40. Total cost an eye watering \u00a39.30 for take away fish and chips. Maybe its to pay for all those staff??Anyway on to the actual fish and Chips I got....The regular chips size wise where about right and they were nice and hot. I would have preferred them to have been fried a bit longer for extra crispiness but they'd spent time in the serving draw which sort of steams all of the crispiness out of them.... acceptable but could have been much better.The fish was hugely more problematic. Firstly theres the \u00a37.90 cost. Will you ever get take away battered cod WORTH that? size wise it made a good meal. \u00a0As I said above there were \u00a023 portions in the warming cabinet when I walked in and the fish I got tasted like it. The batter instead of being crispy like it is when freshly cooked to order was 'damp and mushy' tasting with not even the merest hint of crispiness. I got \u00a0the thin end which didn't flake at all. Taste was o.k but hard to say that over all it wasn't just plain average. The above pretty much sums up my experience of about the last 10? trips over the past couple of years. I only go if theres no other reasonable choice as there really are MUCH MUCH better Fish and Chip places in London than Toff's.For my recommendations....Fishers in Fulham (near Putney bridge) is utterly EPIC. I've not ever been disappointed with Masters Superfish near Waterloo and its only \u00a36.",

    "text": "I consider myself a traveler, not a tourist and I hate tourist trap restaurants. I really wanted good fish and chips on a recent trip to London so I checked Yelp rather than the tourist guide books. I read the reviews for Toff's and decided to go there. I didn't realize Toff's was such a journey away from Kensington where I was staying so my mother and I set off in search of great fish and chips. We took the train to North London and got off and started walking. She hates walking and it was 15+ minute walk uphill for the most part. She complained the entire way. She didn't even appreciate the wonderful park views or lack of tourists. The only thing that stopped her complaining was when the fish and chips were set down in front of us. In short, it was worth the walk and the complaining. The fish was huge and \u00a0crispy and delicious and it was fresh. The chips were the best I had in London or pretty much anywhere. A testament to how good it was is that my mother, who picks at food and eats very little usually, ate everything on her plate and finished before me!The best part of the meal though: the sticky toffee pudding in custard. I'm drooling now thinking about it. I had also wanted authentic sticky toffee pudding while in London, so I killed 2 birds with one stone at Toff's. My mother had the creme caramel and loved it. In addition to the mouthwatering food, the service was friendly, fast, and totally efficient. The owner joked around with us and Alex, our waiter, was a delight. When my \u00a0mother complained to him about the walk from the train he told us to take a bus from right outside so she wouldn't have to walk back. It was one of best dining experiences we had in London. They should consider opening more branches, specifically one in NYC,",
