It was a magical 7 course tasting menu, I still dream of the yuzu truffle oil dressing they used to drench the super high quality sashimi. The meal only got better with Wagyu beef cooked to medium rare perfection. The atmosphere was super cool with an exposed center kitchen/grill. Definitely highly recommended. ALSO! How could I forget the humongous dessert boat filled with sorbets, tropical fruits, brownies filled with green tea, and coconut ice cream filled with citrus amazingness.I'm drooling.",

    "text": "Roka does real special food. It's a fantastic restaurant doing modern, exciting and brilliantly tasty Japanese food. The main bit of the gaff on street level is open, casual with a little dash of Swedish minimalism and centred around the big robata grill where most of the fish and meat gets a roasting, if you're not eating it raw obviously. The menu is varied and as with all these sorts of restaurants best eaten shared with a group of people - the whole place has got a social vibe. For a little bit more romance ask to sit downstairs in the shochu lounge where the feel is totally different, red and black, soft sofas, big cocktail bar and pretty much the same awesome food as upstairs. Roka has won loads of awards which is cool but in sometimes the place itself can seem overrated or hyped by the media. Not so here, this is a quality dining experience, great for mates packing a good wallet, your parents, your work do and maybe a date you want to impress with a bit of class food and pre 'who knows what' atmosphere.",

While I'm usually in it for the 'best value', I will be upfront and say this is a special occasion, splurge fancy affair, but the quality of the food, service and ambiance seems worth the dough. Or quid, if you will. We were invited out with some new and old friends here (and it happened to be Valentine's Day so we made this our celebration as well) and everything was incredible...not just for London standards but right up there with the best of SF and NYC too. We shared a boatload of sushi rolls, sashimi, meat and drinks...more than I can possibly remember, but my favorites included (but are not limited to) the lamb chops dipped in a spicy sauce (tenderoni) the salmon sashimi (like butta), and this insane Wagyu beef roll with truffle shaving (worth a decadent dance). Oh, and my fav dessert--although stuffed, we did not pass up--was this caramel sponge cake thing that I can't describe other than heavenly. Come here, drop lots of cash, eat lots of amazing sushi and Japanese meat and be happy (until you step back outside into the freezing rain.)",

Coming from NY, I've had the opportunity to dine at some excellent restaurants. When people say there is no good food in London, I tell them they just haven't been to the right restaurants. I think without a doubt that Roka is one of the best restaurants in London!!We originally had a reservation for a table in the lounge downstairs, but one look at it and I asked to be reseated upstairs. While the lounge wasn't terrible, it was just very loud and more of a lounge to have drinks in, not dinner. Luckily, there was a table outside, so that was great, even though we didn't get to sit inside by the robayata grill.Everything was perfect, from our food selections, the drink suggestions, and dessert (ok, so the only thing we didn't care for was how incredibly slow the service was, but the amazing quality of the food compensated for that). Do be warned that the portions are small, and not cheap. Here's what we ordered:- Edamame: standard fare, nothing exceptional- Spicy tuna roll - small but really tasty- Black cod and crab dumplings - amazing!! One of my favorites from dinner- Tuna tartare with quail egg yolk - amazing!! Must try- Hamachi tartare with yuzu - very good. Can't beat the texture of a good hamachi- Lamb chops - probably some of the best lambchops I've ever had in my life. Soft, succulent and extremely flavorful- Sea bass with yuzu - this was sooo amazing. The skin was perfectly crisped, the fish was buttery, soft yet firm, and the yuzu flavor was incredibly fresh.- Steamed rice - I know, how can you improve steamed rice, but here they added cracked black sesame on top, which made it very niceDessert:- Chocolate pudding with matcha tea - very nice, rich chocolate taste, however it completely overwhelmed the flavor of the green tea- Chawanmushi with fruit - incredible, satisfying and so comforting.I was lucky to have my birthday dinner here last night. You should definitely check it out, too!",

We had the kani no kama meshi (the rice hotpot with crab and wasabi) which was like a totally novel risotto, delicious crunchy grilled asparagus with sesame, some very good tempura prawns, huge grilled scallop dumplings, a foie gras maki roll and some sushi and sashimi washed down with lots of Dog Point Sauvignon. The dessert was less successful; a boat of all the sweets on offer, but one doesn't go to a Japanese restaurant for the puddings! About \u00a380 a head, so take your No 1 wallet!",

Then before we had barely sat down, they were asking for our order, a bit too efficient, I thought as I had barely hadtime to read the drinks menu, let alone decide on which course. The sushi when it arrived was amazing, arriving in a bucket of ice, and which mixed with the sauce just melted in your mouth. So I would definitely give them top marks for the freshness of the food, the presentation and the thought which had gone into creating the dishes. But I found the service a little too intrusive as they came by every 5 min to give the table a wipe, or clean away barely used dishes. Also at the end I found the price overly expensive. So to sum up, fantastic food, as good as it gets really, but the steep prices and over efficient waiting bring the experience down somewhat. I would say it is not an every day eatery, more of a special occasion place that should definitely be tried once.",

    "text": "Still the best Japanese in London! I've been here a couple of times now, and I can honestly say that Roka is the best Japanese/sushi I have had in London. And I've had quite a lot. But Roka is the full package: Ambience, service, location, design and of course the food. I was there for lunch and my friend and I agreed that there was not a singe thing on the entire menu we wouldn't love to have. The bits we selected were awesome, but I can't wait to come back to try more stuff. It's expensive, yes. But it's worth it if you want to splash out. You won't regret it. For a super-stylish, super-delicious eat in London, Roka is the safe choice.",

Only slight negative was being informed at time of booking that we would have a 2 hour time slot for the table which always irritates me slightly, especially at an expensive place.Sushi and sashimi were excellent although my order of marinated sea bass sashimi was so small it was perched in tiny shards on top of a lemon half. At first I thought it was an amuse bouche from the chef due to the diminuitive portion . Gyoza very good. Great tempura and grilled sea bass (again) was simple and excellent. Attentive and friendly service and well organized. Cocktails were another high point. I like the open grill in the middle of the room. Buzzy vibe and cool understated decor. Looks like they have a cool cocktail bar downstairs. Maybe try that out in the future. Overall quite a pricey meal but high quality. Not an every day place but for a special occasion.",

Kimchi was so salty it was inedible. \u00a0Being korean I have a high tolerance for salty kimchi. The lamb chops which are usually superb were just average and cooked unevenly. Temperature of all the food was a bit too cold. All in all still a decent meal but far from the standard i expect at this price and from this restaurant in particular. \u00a0I feel bad giving it just three stars as nearly every meal I've had except the last one has been superb.",

Our expectations were pretty low when we arrived at this Japanese restaurant, but I walked away proclaiming that this was the BEST JAPANESE MEAL of MY ENTIRE LIFE.We ordered everything from the grill (rotabayaki): Baby Back Ribs (AMAZING, flavored like Pork from a Chinese Butcher shop -- trust me, this is a good thing), Filet Mignon, Salmon, and Tofu. All were delicious with a unique flavor that I haven't experienced anywhere else. For dessert, had the black sesame mochi ice cream and a chocolate souffl\u00e9/pot dish. Both were PHENOMENAL!!!!Great ambiance, service, and above all, food, I wish I could eat at this place more often, but for now, will have to wait until the next time I am in London...maybe in 10 years? Would love to try the sushi next time, but don't know if can resist all the things i ordered this visit!",

    "text": "Excellent place. We came on a Friday evening (c. 8pm) without a reservation. It took about 30 minutes of waiting to get seated (not bad) but we sat at the counter as all tables were booked. (There is a downstairs bar where can grab a drink while you wait, although we just stayed outside.) The counter is a nice option, though, as it allows you to watch the chefs as they work in the 'open kitchen' in the center of the restaurant. There are plenty of food options here and a range of alcohols. The beer selection is pathetic; how about some Baird, Ise Kadoya or Hitachino? (These are all Japanese craft beers.) Anyway, we had the glazed pork ribs, roast duck, edamame and beef dumplings. Everything was very, very good. The duck was more succulent than you could ever imagine, and I would recommend it. The prices for some of the dishes aren't actually that bad; a the medium-sized rack of pork ribs ran about 10 quid. All in, the meal was a little over 40, which didn't include any drinks.The service here is excellent and everyone from the matre d' down to the bus boys is really on their game. Even the head chef bid us farewell as we departed. The ambiance overall is great. I can't really find fault with any aspect of this restaurant - except maybe for the beer, but I'm guessing I'm one of very few people with this qualm. Well worth a visit.",

    "text": "Excellent service and food.The concept of Roka is family style eating but on a very small scale. The dishes are very small (our server recommended ordering 4-5 dishes per person). For example, the chicken and spring onion dish only includes two skewers. Our table of 4 ordered too many dishes to count and we ended up leaving about 3 dishes total at the table. I think a better recommendation would be to order 3 dishes per person and then order more if you are still hungry. The prices of the dishes add up very quickly!As a side note, the menu on Roka's website is not inclusive of everything they offer. They have a much larger selection than what is noted on the website.With 12.5% service included in the bill, our table of 4's bill was \u00a3225 which included food, one glass of wine, one mixed drink, one bottle of Coke (200ml), and one bottle of sparkling water.Below are the dishes we ordered and our thoughts:-Edemame - very large serving, nice sea salt on top-Spicy tuna maki - the smallest rolls I've ever seen but excellent (nice crusty touch on the rice)-Chicken and spring onion skewers - our favorite-Salmon - excellent-Sea bream - too meaty for our taste-Sea bass - good but as a warning, it is served with skin on (deboned)-Beef dumplings - excellent-Lamb - excellent-Duck - chewy, would not order it again, left all but two thin slices-Chili beef - excellent-BBQ ribs - very little meat, would not order again-Chicken wings - even less meat than the ribs, tiniest wings I've seen-Steamed rice - nice serving size, cooked well, needed salt (no salt or pepper on the table)-Asparagus - grilled to perfection-Broccoli - cooked perfectly, excellent tasteThe only reason why I did not rate Roka with 5 stars is:1. Serving utinels are not provided with the dishes, so you are forced to use your chopsticks or cutlery to cut off pieces or scrape pieces off skewers (e.g. asparagus). My husband and I met his friend and her husband for dinner and it was a bit strange to have everyone's cutlery touching all the food, especially since this was the first time I had met them.2. There is not enough room on the table for all the dishes, so staff was constantly moving plates around to make more room for the additional dishes as they were coming out of the kitchen. Perhaps it is just me but they always seemed to move my water glass or another dish near my right forearm, so my arm was either always almost knocking over my water or rubbing in one of the dishes. They need to invest in some sort of tiered structure in the middle of the table that can swivel. The table was too cluttered and it was impossible to pass dishes around as there was nowhere to set them after you have taken your portion off the plate.Overall, excellent experience. The nicest restaurant we have eaten at in London after having lived here for a year.",

Basically you add \u00a325 per person on the tap and we definitely made the most out of the \u00a325. I think they might've stationed a staff at our table just to refill our glasses because it was constantly filled. Drinks aside, food was good. Standard Azumi restaurants quality. Fish was fresh, I've had more buttery yuzu cod, more flavorful tuna tartare and fattier o-toro from the same chain. But nonetheless really fab food by London jap food standard. I loved their fried eggplant dish. It's so simple and delicious. The green tea molten cake was also surprisingly good and I love how watching green juice gushing out of my dessert makes me feel like an extra-celestial being. So yes, overall 4-star because they made my sunday afternoon absolutely fabulous. It won't make a 5-star because I'm an uber-snob when it comes to Jap food. My advice is, go on Sunday, have a blast and take Monday off. oh, and go soon because if my friends and I keep going back there they might cancel their champagne offer very soon.",

It is nice inside and hostess at the entrance was so friendly We opted for the tasting menu - which I was not keen on (as most restaurants from my experience stretch out the serving of courses to over two hours and to me that is too long for such small bites) Anyway, Roka's tasting menu service was very quick and yummy However, because I did not take long time to read (memorise) the dishes, and because it is extremely loud and busy restaurant , I had to ask the waiter once more to repeat what he has just served (only once I promise) and he answered my question in a sort of shouting tone !! Now I understand that he might not be the happiest in his job (I am not) and he might be doing this till his next casting is a success (he was handsome) but I did not appreciate the attitude! Each course was very good and fruit platter was epic I would definitely try to book my next visit soon",

I came here for a work dinner, so we could order a lot more than my un-rich self would have been able to afford, and sampled all kinds of stuff on the menu. It was fairly hit and miss - some items were delicious, some just good or okay.If you come for dinner without a reservation, you will probably need to sit at the bar, but I liked that anyway because we could watch the chefs prepare the food. My favorite dishes were the nigiri with quail's egg and the desserts (we ordered a few and shared, and I honestly don't remember which ones - it was a whirlwind of food entering my face!) We also had some tasty wine, but again even the cheapest of glasses and bottles is pricey.For London standards, I think this is fairly good sushi. But I've been to a few London sushi places now, and I'm realizing that the standards aren't very high. Strange, because most of the sushi I've had so far has been in the midwest US, and it doesn't seem like it's even on that level. I would say I'm going to the wrong places, but Roka is so highly rated for sushi! Oh well, London does plenty of other food well!",

If you want a hip trendy albeit very expensive Japanese experience this needs to be on your short-list.I tried several dishes and was happy with all of them. Really enjoyed the beef gyoza (gyuniku to goma no gyoza or something like that!) and the tuna tataki salad. I only had sushi and appetizers but next time I will try some of the mains, they looked amazing. The cocktails were great as well, can't remember what I ordered but it had sake, cucumbers and some goodness. Service was attentive though one overly eager waiter seemed annoyed when I tried to pour myself water from the large bottle of Voss.If you're in a small party, ask to sit by the Sushi bar, so you can see the chefs work their magic. The bar itself is made from several enormous trees which adds to the experience. The crowd is fashionable, so do dress up if you go.",

The overall atmosphere and neutral contemporary interior, combined with that stunning natural light made this a perfect early dinner hot spot for a summer evening.

Quite simply not up to scratch across a range of factors, but mainly the service, quality of food and value for money.Let's start on service: I cannot stand when waiters continuously try to up sell more dishes and 'recommend' the most expensive items on the menu. Ours did this on at least three occasions, grating on us more and more each time and generally just spoiling our mood.On quality of food, the sushi was really poor. Nizuni across the street serves better at about 2/3rds of the price. On the dishes that did deliver, the price left a sour taste. Their black cod is undoubtedly amazing, but should be about \u00a310 cheaper. Again you can get great alternatives elsewhere in this area for much more reasonable prices. Willing to overlook price if the restaurant delivers on amazing overall experience, but the poor service just compounded my negative feeling towards this place.I've been told the new Aldwych branch is a much better operation, so given the strong reputation of the chain, I may give them a 2nd chance via a visit to that location.",

I live in California and I am not Japanese, so I am not an expert, but at the same time... I have a mouth and I have taste buds and I have other senses like telepathy and kinship with treefolk and who cares what else I am capable of, I know what good sushi is.London sushi always disappoints me. Always. It is at the point where I actually don't think it should disappoint me anymore, but somehow it still does.Roka is highly regarded. I think it even got some Michelin attention, but that could be fabricated and I didn't bother to check on that one. Anyway, people say you should go here and as a guy here for a table of one, it still took a while to find a spot, so people clearly still think they should go here.It was just nothing special and the price was acting as though it was. The rolls I ordered all had some sort of gluten containing ingredients that weren't listed on the menu, so I had to send them back. Gluten in your food? Not a problem. Secret gluten in your food? Problem.The nigiri was fine, but it wasn't that great. I had a rum and coke and that was the best part of my meal.I went to Tesco after and got some food to snack on. I won't be coming back, though I will say that the service was pretty good. If you live in London and you are content with the sushi you have had in your city thus far, you may like it here.But, be warned... you have poor taste. I'm sorry that I have to be the one to tell you this! Really, I am. I don't even know you. So I'm sure that stings a little. But it's true, and someone should tell you. So, it's me.Come to California and eat our sushi. Or better yet, go the other direction and go to Japan. Then bring back what you learned and start your own restaurant. Please. I will visit you and pay you money for you to feed me.",

The atmosphere is fantastic - if there are only two of you, I would highly recommend reserving seats on the bench-style tables, which face directly onto the grill - it's fantastic to see the cooking up close, and to hear the \"OI!\" shouted every few minutes.",

The atmosphere is great, however, the restaurant gets really busy during weekends which makes it hard to find a table. I am a vegetarian but they have quite a few vegetarian options on the menu.

Roka is several levels of expense above that.All the food was beautifully balanced as had all the delicate flavouring you expect from good Japanese food. Gorgeous presentation and a menu you want to order everything from. The Baby back ribs were a particular highlight for me as was the Black cod marinated in yuzu miso and homemade hajikami.",

    "text": "My friend and I decided to check out Fitzrovia and we happened upon Roka. We were attracted by the fishbowl design of the restaurant and the huge wooden front doors. Good thing about eating lunch at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon is there was no wait. However, that is not to say the restaurant wasn't busy. I reckon you have to make reservations in order to eat here for dinner.The services are was amazing, especially by London standard. We sat down and immediately we were handed warm towels. After learning that my friend has gluten allergy and is lactose intolerant, our waiter went away and came back with a list of dishes on the menu that are safe for her. And when he served the food, he made sure to put all the sauces in front of me, so she wouldn't accidentally use them! However, due to the dietary restriction, I have to say, the flavor of my meal was compromised a bit. We basically ordered simply grilled dishes. The sea bass grilled over banana leaf was delicious, especially the smoky flavored part that was close to the slightly burnt leaf. Roka offers a tasting menu that looks divine, especially the dessert boat I saw on the neighboring table. I had serious food envy that afternoon. I am definitely coming back for the full tasting menu.",

Unfortunately, my last two experiences were sub-par, and the most recent so bad I cannot imagine returning. They've lost their edge, and are no longer worth it. Actively avoid this place.We made dinner reservations in advance. Within minutes of sitting, we ordered the tasting menu, at their suggestion. \u00a0I've had it in the past; it's a large tasting menu, with many courses (twelve?). \u00a0The food was generally good, but it took them a long time (30-45 minutes?) to start serving us, and once they did, it was very, very rushed. \u00a0We were eating very quickly--even by American standards, and by European standards it was a flat-out race to finish.Toward the end, they were bringing us multiple courses simultaneously, and taking away dishes before we could finish them. \u00a0Finally, they brought the desert--which looked pretty. I wish I could report on how it tasted.Unfortunately, as they brought the desert, they also informed us that they had people waiting for our table, and they needed us to leave. They acted as though we had done something wrong. This before we'd even had a chance to eat our dessert! We pointed out to the manager that we had been eating as quickly as they served us, and that we wanted to finish the meal.Now, here's the crazy part--the manager actually came and took our desert away while we were eating it, informing us that it was time to leave!So here's my response:We did not design their tasting menu. We ordered the most expensive item on their menu, and ate it as fast as they delivered it. It is not our fault they took a long time to get started, nor that they are booking tables too closely together given the menu they have designed, and their ability to serve it.We didn't expect them to take as long to serve the meal as they did (2.5 hours total). And I hate feeling rushed by a restaurant who clearly cannot get their own act together. \u00a0But to actually come to the table and remove food, which they've charged us for, and tell us (in front of our guests) that we had to leave because they had booked the table, is simply inexcusable. \u00a0Hey Roka: if you want your tables turned more frequently, don't take so long to start serving, and don't design and recommend a menu that you cannot serve in the time allotted!The food is okay. \u00a0The price is very high (\u00a3120 per person, without alcohol).The service sucks. \u00a0Avoid.",

My friend and I ordered glasses of wine and Japanese sangria throughout our meal. We started with the edamame, assorted tempura, and cod dumplings, all of which were delicious (as expected). When our main dishes arrived - duck and sea bass - we poked around at the dishes but were generally uninterested in consuming our meals. Did we just order the wrong dishes??From the minute we arrived, we were excited to devour the food and keep ordering to hearts' content. This didn't happen :( I also ordered the sorbet dessert and the waiter was kind of rude. I wanted my dessert while my friend was still eating her main course. The waiter refused to serve my dessert until the entire table was clear and we were both done with our main dishes. What's the big deal?? In any case, I do plan to dine here again and I only hope my next time will be better, both in terms of food and service.",

My husband and I tried the premium set course since we wanted great food with not much effort and it did not disappoint. We also added the Japanese Wagu so it averaged to about $97\u20ac a persons which was well worth it. We had no reservations, just walked in to the bar area. The restaurant was booked but we got lucky. The service was great, they even made me a Special Michelada once they caught wind of me trying to make my own! Turns out the head bartender is from South America and knows all about making good Michelada's in London! Afterwards we walked downstairs to the bar, which was equally awesome. Great music, great drinks and great service. Vibe was very hip and trendy but not too pretentious. I think we found a gem!!",

Their cocktails are creative and the staff is super nice. Totally was a great spot for a night cap. The upstairs dinner area is always bustling as well. We sat at the bar and ordered a few dishes including their special dish yellow tail sashimi, soft shelled crab and some apps. Everything was delicious! Great place for a treat or a nightcap if you are okay with busy and loud.",

I probably would have preferred slightly slower pacing but overall it was a ton of food.-- \u00a0Went with the Wagyu upgrade on the tasting menu, one of the best food decisions of my life. \u00a0I don't have Wagyu very often (I prefer a US style steak) but it was incredible. \u00a0It was clearly Wagyu, not a hybrid where you can't tell the difference except by looking at the price. \u00a0It was fantastic flavor and texture.-- \u00a0The sashimi course was great. \u00a0Very fresh fish and even the scallops (I normally don't like shell fish sushi) was not too chewy-- \u00a0The yuzu truffle dressing that comes with the yellowtail carpaccio was incredible, best sashimi/carpaccio I have ever had-- \u00a0The seared beef with black truffle was also incredible, tasted like typical Japanese beef appetizer but the truffle made it very special-- \u00a0Dessert was over the top. \u00a0I huge plate with great fresh fruit, multiple ice creams and a molten chocolate cakeService was better than I had been warned about. \u00a0Overall, great experience.",

I also ordered the lamb cutlets with korean spices. \u00a0It came with a small amount of chilli sauce and I ordered a side dish of rice (which was a bit undercooked). \u00a0The juice of the day pineapple, spinach and ginger was just ok and came in a tiny cup. \u00a0The lamb was just ok but for that price I expected it to be amazing. \u00a0Overpriced in my opinion. It was nice to see the chef's cook the food in front of you in the open style restaurant. My personal waiter didn't particularly come across as friendly and didn't smile despite my efforts to engage him. Most of the other staff are pretty friendly.There is also wifi available.Overall I would say most of the staff are great, premises clean with service efficient, but as for the food I can get the same quality of food elsewhere for a much cheaper price.",

    "text": "A couple of weeks ago we went to ROKA Charlotte St. \u00a0a superb Japanese Izakaya western twisted cuisine restaurant in London, just a five minutes walk from Goodge Street Tube station, it was totally sugoi!!!! Upon arrival, the staff welcomes you with a nice and lovely smile, since the moment we got in, the service was wonderful, very discreet and attentive from the beginning, everybody is friendly and will do anything they can to improve your experience in a crowded but at the same time relaxed ambience, with nice music and dime romantic lights, loud and clear enough to have a conversation and read the menu without any trouble. \u00a0 There are two areas, downstairs where you could find their amazing Shochu lounge, here you may enjoy a nice Japanese or classic cocktails with some Nihon tapas, or one of the 50 different references of Whiskies they have from the rising sun's country, among other interesting things, before you go upstairs to have your meal. The main attraction is the Robata bar island, in the middle of the room, which allows you to observe the skills of the chefs and obviously their show cooking with some Japanese shouting orders, and at the same time it guarantee the freshness of every single ingredient and of course that they make everything at the moment, for me is the best place to seat.What an impressing meal, absolutely everything was prepared and presented more than very well with a perfect timings of serving, our table was always with food on it. We went for omakase style, Daniel one of the managers looked after us, and together with the waiter did the unforgettably order for us, excepting for the salty edamame and sakemaki or salmon hosomaki for my daughter, I ordered for her, she cannot visit a Japanese restaurant without eating it.We started with the aburi sake tataki with ponzu sesame out of this world dressing and very crispy sweet potato, fantastic balance between acidity and creaminess, very light but flavorful at the same time, we just loved it. One of the best western twist salmon tataki I ever had. The deep fried Nasu (eggplant) salad with sesame miso dressing and bonito flakes, really surprised me, the texture was firm, I couldn't feel any oil at all, the touch of the spring onion, miso and katsobushi gave it the perfect combination for a nice umami, it melted in my mouth. At the same time we had a crispy soft shell crab tempura in ponzu sauce with shichimi togarashi shiso, kizami nori and some arare, it was sublime, but the jewel-like squid tataki with yuzu shallot dressing was even better. The Scallops from the robata served with a wasabi and shiso cream and the tenderstem broccoli with ginger and moromi miso were delicious too.Regarding the sushi, I must say the sashimi moriawase was one of the best ever in a long time, they offer different sizes depending on amount of persons, you will always have a selection of sashimi chosen by the chef, usually sake and toro are fixed included, there were hotate (scallops), lobster sashimi with different dressings (depends on season) this time was Mandarin Koshu, salmon tatar, hamachi, sea bream and ama ebi with imperial osietra caviar, all of it with nama wasabi, the fish was unquestionably of the highest grade and well execute, more than oishii. Unfortunately the maki selection was not at the same level, the ingredients and fusion were more than ok, but the quality of the rice was not the proper one, was too dry, however the temperature and the flavor was very good, my favorite was the wagyu tempura maki, quite impressive and nice move. \u00a0  \u00a0At least but not less important we enjoyed the tai no miso-yaki which is a fantastic sea bream fillet with miso and red pickled onion The fish was cooked perfectly, falling off with ease and silky soft inside, the taste of the miso was amazing, this dish impressed me a lot, it was a clear example that sometimes less is more.If you were waiting for the sweet part, let me tell you that the dessert platter was 100 times Sugoi!!!!! I do not know how to start, lets see.... It was a simply beautiful plate with assorted of exotic fruits with some real good ice creams, a lovely soft and warm dark chocolate brownie with a surprise viscous green tea pudding fondant inside, had a peanut, vanilla and chocolate sundae with sesame poki sticks and banana tempura, this one was my favorite, but the coconut and passion parfait, pineapple and kiwi fruit simply blowed my daughter's mind away.Definitely Roka, rocks!",

    "text": "I love japanese food. Even more than chinese food, and considering I am of chinese descent, it means a lot. I've been to Roka a few times, all were 'special occasions'. It's that kind of place, with it's trendy decor (love that bar made from a beautiful piece of tree) and it's even trendier bar downstairs (overrated methinks). The main attention here, is it's robata grill. Sitting in the middle of the restaurant, it's hard to avoid the lovely smells coming from here. And it's also the thing to remember when you are looking at the extensive menu wondering what to order. Anyone who has been to Japan knows that the restaurants tend to specialise in a particular type of food. It might be something simple like ramen, or something special like hokkaido hotpot. So, when you go to Roka, look at the grill, look back at the menu and order something that will come off the grill. I have had the tastiest asparagus ever experienced from that grill. Lamb chops, smoky and marinated in a lovely sauce, amazing. And from the grill. Everything else, including the sushi - not bad, not amazing. Desserts - rather disappointing in fact. Service, pleasant. Bill, look away and drop your credit card quickly. I'll be back for sure - Roka sits in the list of places for those special occasions where I want to go somewhere nice and have a great meal. I've paid more for much less. Much much less.",

It isn`t cheap but it far exceeds anything I`ve tried in other up market oriental restaurants. We didn`t book so we sat on the bar in front of the grill. I think I`d rather have a table if I were going with a party of four or more as you all have to sit in a row. The bar downstairs is intimate and dark with lots of stained wood and soft lighting but I wouldn`t go there for the bar alone. \u00a39.60 for a glass of sauvignon was just too steep.",

I've found the food to be utterly delicious each time I've been lucky enough to be taken there (that's 3 times nom nom nom). If you do want to blow the bank, I recommend the Black Cod in Miso, the asparagus stack and the unbearably good chocolate pudding with maccha (green tea) centre. Roka is definitely way above my budget for everyday eating but as a special occasion blowout restaurant, it's one of the best in London.",

If that's what you're looking for, then it's perfect and sometimes that is what I'm looking for. However, I generally go for the hole-in-the-wall sushi place that \u00a0serves me amazing fish; no deep fried rolls, no cream cheese with my sushi, no silly salads: simple fish, done simply and simply delicious. I know those places in LA and I'm hunting for them in London. I'm determined to find them. In the meantime, Roka gets 4 stars for great quality fish and a beautiful atmosphere - even if it is a scene I wouldn't generally choose for myself.",

    "text": "I had to eat at the London Roka as a promise to the staff at the Roka Akor in Scottsdale AZ, where I had my first Roka experience on vacation in September (reviews of places from my September vacation on its way!). They were curious to know how the 2 restaurants would compare on separate continents.Both restaurants are dominated by a robata grill in the middle of the restaurant where you can see the chefs at work.Drum roll..... well I preferred the Roka in Scottsdale though the London venue is also a good place to try Japanese food without breaking the wallet too badly. My gripes with the London venue are that the restaurant is crowded with tables close together and you do feel quite rushed with dishes flying in even though there's not always space on the table for them.I had the premium tasting menu and again at the London restaurant, you do feel short-changed. In Scottsdale, the sashimi in the premium tasting menu includes top fish like toro whereas the London restaurant served salmon and tuna. Don't get me wrong, what did arrive from the London kitchen tasted great and I would wholly recommend a meal there but in comparison to the Scottsdale restaurant, it just came up a notch short.The tasting menu allows a variety of dishes to be tried and is probably a good introduction for those new to Japanese food. Presentation is beautiful with the signature Roka trick of presenting the fresh food on huge chunks of ice carved from a block at the bar.My personal favourite dishes were the scallop skewers - the scallops were huge and sweet and given a kick from the spices. The lamb cutlets with Korean spices were also tender and yummy. An unusual dish I've had at Roka was the kamameshi rice pot, a sort of Japanese risotto with king crab and a kick from wasabi pearls.So a nice restaurant but Scottsdale wins.",

The restaurant sells itself on the dishes from its open robata grill but the sushi and sashimi are also exceptional. If you can, go for one of the tasting menus \u00a0highlights include wagyu sushi, grilled scallop skewers, grilled quail and their giant dessert platter. It's not cheap but I struggle to find much wrong with this buzzy restaurant and I'm usually very suspicious of over-stylised Asian places.

What they do, they do very well but if they toned it all down a bit the experience would be enhanced significantly. The decor is fantastic, very modern, chic and enticing. The staff are excellent, attentive and knowledgeable if just a bit cold. About the food - when I eat sushi I look for three things; freshness, flavor and simplicity. If you're adding all kinds of ancillary crap to a plate of sashimi then I'm immediately going to be suspicious of the actual fish itself. Roka cannot be faulted on the quality of their food though, it was fresh, flavorful and well presented. If they move away from the haute cuisine just a bit and focus on their great product just a bit more then they'd be able to compete with Zuma and Defune. Yeah, I said it, what of it. I think Defune is better. One of the things that garners them an additional star in my book is their wine and drinks list. You'll struggle to find better in quality of quantity. I'd go back but it wouldn't be my first choice.",

If you want to eat at the counter rather than at a table you wont have to book in advance on weekdays, but on w/e this place is crazy and gets packed even in the early hours for dinner. There's a bar downstairs where you can also eat and is a bit less noisy, and in my opinion it gives you a bit more privacy. I prefer the top floor. Definitely worth a visit!",

This restaurant is related by ownership to the stellar Zuma restaurant, but this outlet does not even come close to stacking up to the quality & ambience of Zuma. Roka's atmosphere is not as cool or fashionable as Zuma's (which could be a good thing, but the missing ambience is not made up in any way) I have eaten here about 10 times, including downstairs in the very cool Shochu bar (I recommend this place for a drink!), and the food is not great. They have dropped the crispy squid from the menu, and the there are no real amazing dishes here. Most recently I ordered the shrimp tempura (it was AWFUL), an assortment of sushi (flavourless and forgettable), miso soup (white which had a nice bit of oyster pieces, but overly salty), black cod (it was OK) and some hamachi tartar (which was awful). On the whole, the food was either bland, poorly prepared or overpowered by sauces. Meanwhile, the prices are just as high as Zuma, so you know what?? Just go to Zuma! This place is awful and getting worse.",

But don't worry this praise is not going to be too sweetly flavored..the relation ship is over, now go there just for the divine food.On my unforgettable dates we had this seafood tasting menu for two, that pretty much covered Japanese cuisine from raw fish to a divine deserts. They just kept bringing us different plates of food like art pieces, that was fun and cute to share. I have no idea what the bill was, but I am sure it was a lot. The place is cosy with contemporary interior and with a big open grill on the first floor. The food is amazing, not just sushi and sashimi but also roka and rokata, and other Japanese modern dishes with names I have never heard of.

It could have been better signposted, I walked up and down Charlotte Street twice before I found it (but I am slightly blonde). Even on a Thursday evening the place was heaving but that did not impact the level of attention from the waiting staff. We were constantly attended to and they were more than happy to help work through the menu. The sashimi was brilliant but that is a given so I will talk about the things I tried that was new to me and might be for you as well. The Ko Nasu (Eggplant) was magical. Seriously, it melted in the mouth and the flavours of the ginger and other marinade just made my tongue squeal. The asparagus with seasame seeds was also amazing, in fact my heart is skipping a beat as I write this - gosh food can evoke emotions - it was so exciting to eat something so familiar yet served up in such a different way. The only thing I wasn't so impressed with was the dark chocolate and maccha pudding (that had ROKA etched all over it!!) - it was YUCK but hey you might love it. It might as well have been marmite on a plate for me. There was some noxious looking green goo leaking out of it as well which I think the waiting staff (that recommended it!) mentioned was green tea somethingIt just looked like slime to me. The ladies toilet (I can't help but mention them in my reviews :blush:) was clean, small and dark. The lighting could have been better but I loved the dark wood and chrome. There were individual hand towels which I thought was a nice touch but no hand cream which was a bit blah. We stayed upstairs in the dining area so I can't comment on the bar below but it sounded really buzzy. I also know they do great cocktails or at least I have heard so but as I didn't try any last night I can't comment on this. My date and I went through a few bottles of rather lovely dry white wine though. All in all, I found it a great dining experience but although the company was much better last night and the food just as good, I would still choose my Umu date over it as my Japanese restaurant of choice in London purely on the understated glamour & exclusive stakes alone (oops does that sound as shallow as it reads?!). The atmosphere is a LOT more lively at ROKA though so it depends on what you are looking for. Can't comment on how expensive or not it was because I did not get to see the bill but I do know that I would happiy return regardless of who was picking up the bill!",

Glass walled on two sides, walls which fold back to allow a terrace on warm summer days and nights, with the main robatayaki grill square in the middle edged by an elm bar and closely packed tables of simple yet elegant design, it's a place to be seen in.The food is very expenive. Here though it should be pointed out that no Japanese restaurant is cheap. Top quality raw fish is expensive and the penalty of eating non-quality raw fish doesn't need spelling out. I would particularly recommond the aubergine from the grill with mirin, ginger and soy. This made this sometimes unassuming vegetable take on new depths of flavour.A word of advice-steer away from the \u00a350 taster menu.
