I almost hesitate to write about Hung's because once I put this information out into the ethos, there is no telling what will happen! \u00a0Hung's is my favourite Chinese restaurant and if you go there it won't take long for you to figure out why. \u00a0I will readily admit that most of the time I order the same few dishes, why mess with perfection and nothing I've eaten has disappointed me. \u00a0On cold afternoon or evenings I enjoy duck noodle soup with tea (a staggering \u00a35). \u00a0The soup has a rich broth with green onions, noodles and large slices of duck. \u00a0With the duck, be warned, some of the pieces have bones in them, so you have to chew around the bone. \u00a0I will readily admit, not the most lady like of endeavors but the food is so delicious that one soon gets over it. \u00a0The other dishes I like are a portion of duck (don't get a half it's really a big serving), crispy belly pork, and fried rice. \u00a0Hung's has the best fried rice I've ever eaten, that with the duck (don't forget to watch the bones) and pork, perfect! \u00a0The mixture of the pork and duck are an excellent combination and tossing in a bit of broccoli with ginger, the meal is complete.Hung's is the best Chinese restaurant in Chinatown and I hope that by sharing this little nugget that it doesn't end up being the most crowded!",

    "text": "With a front window full of hanging and marinading roasted meats, Hung's set their stall out early. It would have been churlish to ignore this carnivorous bounty and, being no churl, we went for a selection of char siu, the honeyed roast pork, along with crispy cubes of belly pork known as siu yuk. Neither was bad by any stretch of the imagination, but served simply on a bed of rice they came over either as underpowered or too subtle, depending how charitable you're feeling. Moist and well cooked, I just wanted more taste. Flavourwise, things improved with a beef brisket hot pot. Big chunks of meltingly tender beef fell apart in a thick gravy of umami flavour. MSG enhanced? Almost certainly, the cloying afterburn of the flavour enhancer was unmistakable, but a perfect dish for a cold February night notwithstanding. Oddly, despite being a hot pot dish, it was obviously cooked in another dish and served in the clay pot as the outer container arrived stone cold, hastening the cooling down of the meat inside.",

We really liked the food and the interior is as shabby as always in a good Chinese. The starters were very tasty and the duck with bone was delicious. We saw them in the window and I was wondering if they were any good for years. Finally I was curious enough to go there this time. I can definitely recommend this restaurant. It was not too expensive and the waiters were very friendly. It is one of those I am always looking for.",

Upon entering the establishment, we were immediately received by a hostile environment which led to a less than enthusiastic waiting staff who treated us as unwelcome guests to say the least. We decided to leave, but one member of the group was keen on ordering from Hungs. After odering, the employee informed us that in order to pay for our order by card, we would need to purchase a 2 meal minimum. Unhappy with their attitude, we asked to speak with management. We were first sent down a dirty stairwell which led to a filthy kitchen, upon our return, we were told to head up a non-existant stairway, clearly an effort to send us away in a quite insulting fashion.Ive never reviewed on this website, however this service was offensive to say the least and I recommend reviewing other options before settling on this below par establishment.",

This place is my regular Chinatown haunt and it has barely changed in all the years I've eaten here despite a refurb and name change (it used to be called Crispy Duck). It might look tiny but its on three floors so don't be put off if it seems full. Whilst it won't change your life, Hung's wonton noodles (\u00a34.50) tick all the boxes. The wontons have the right mix of prawn and fatty pork, they use the proper fresh egg noodle (san mein in Cantonese) and the broth isn't MSG laden. It's not a big bowl but compared to the miniscule portions that you sometimes get in Hong Kong, it's a supersize portion. Anyway, you get your money's worth with six wontons. I tried king prawn dumpling soup noodles (\u00a34.80) a week later, these dumplings are bigger than their wontons and have more king prawn. They're known as sui gow in Cantonese or shui jiao in Mandarin. In my opinion, these are tastier than their wontons !",

Simply speaking, Hung's doesn't taste fresh. Service was somewhat lacking, too. When our waiter delivered our food, I asked whether they had hot sauce, to which he nodded - and promptly left, never to return. So, we ate our somewhat lacking-in-flavour Chinese lunch sans-hot sauce, and after waiting about half an hour had to track down another waiter to get our check. Anyway, I don't regret trying Hung's, but I certainly won't be returning any time soon.",

It's from the functional school of Chinatown dining, melamine tables that can be wiped down between customers. Like a lot of the Chinatown establishments solo diners looking for a quick fix sit downstairs with larger parties ferried upstairs to the top two floors and bigger tables. The food here is Cantonese and it has one of the best selections of noodle soups for lunch, anything from the usual won ton and roast meats through delectable king prawn dumplings before getting to the more obtuse tripe, tendon and pigs knuckles - all worth a go. Main dishes have the usual standards, although why would you order sweet and sour chicken when prawn stuffed tofu in black bean or ong choy with fermented bean curd were available, let alone starting with spring rolls instead of soft shell crab? Come Chinese New Year they stick on a special menu so it's well worth popping down then for some fat choi (hair fungus), lettuce and pig's trotter.

Wandering around the myriad of small restaurants in London's Chinatown, I was unsure which one to check out further for some takeaway. In the end, it was the very low whitehead:blackhead (Caucasian to Asian) ratio in the place that made me enter this place. 8 GBPs for a huge portion of sliced BBQ pork in my mind was a bargain. Watching it prepped in front of me was also a pretty good show and clearly they are good at this since the guy with the cleaver had all of his fingers before and after. Once I was able to eat it, it was as soul-satisfying as any I have had in Hong Kong in the past. Happy to recommend this place for the hanging BBQ. Looking forward to checking out some other stuff on the menu in the future.",

But then again this is London.. not NYC, not America. I was already happy to be able to eat asian food again so I brushed that aside. The dish wasn't mind blowing or fantastic. But it tasted very authentic, true chinese cuisine at its best. Definitely not that fast food to go crap that serves general tso's chicken and stuff.

Then not long after another friend stumbles down the steps with a deadstop using his head and wall. Yes there mistakes and both were very apologetic.So Saturday night we were greated by the owner. He is a very patient man. He recounte a story or two. The food was just delicious. We just ordered for the table, duck, stomach, fried wontons, spicey noodles and another noodle dish. The food came out quick. I was impressed as this place is three stories. We were on the top level. Their was a good line waiting to get seated when we left.",

Nevertheless, my friend and I ended up looking for a place to eat around 9 pm. We figured we should probably just eat near the hotel we were staying at, W Hotel. There are tons of Chinese restaurants right outside the W. We looked at some of the menus from the outside and then settled at Hung's. I have to say, the price was reasonable compared to other restaurants I've been eating at in London, and it was actually good! My dining experience in London haven't been great to be honest, basically have been eating overpriced mediocre food. I don't mind paying $$ for good food, but the I don't like paying lots of money for food that won't even be good. Well, Hung's vegetable noodle soup just hit the spot. I'm glad it was the last stop of my London trip. Beats all the other fancy expensive restaurants I had been dining with.",

Flavor, texture, MOISTURE, everything was just right. Except it definitely wasn't half the duck. The dish came with thin pancakes, cucumbers, green onions and brown sauce. The duck came in a rectanglular tupperware that could fit approximately 5 decks of cards. But the bottom was layered with crispy rice crackers to elevate the duck so it appeaed to be more than there actually is. The amount of duck we got was definitely not worth \u00a321 and we felt ripped off.",

The food was good, but my only qualm was that a lot of it was cold (the roast pork and the vegetables), as if it had been sitting out for a while. I really enjoyed the hot and sour soup though! I think I can say it's the best hot and sour soup I've ever had in my life--most places tend to make a soup that is neither hot nor sour, but Hung's did both! I think I'd go back, but hopefully next time I do, my food will be hot!",

The restaurant has 3 floors and narrow hallways and fairly steep stairs, so if you are expecting elevators or ADA ramps you can forget that. Now onto food and service. We had to waive down someone for menus, minus one star. And then again wave down someone to get tea, water and they didn't refill, minus another star.We should have left and went to Wong Kei nearby.But since we were here, we'd give it a try. we ordered 3 meat bbq plate (duck, pork belly, and soy sauce chicken). duck was not CRISPY but SOGGY, pork belly was too salty, and chicken was good. added some choi sum in garlic which was good. and also wonton soup, which was ok but a little bland.overall minus another star for food quality.I would recommend going somewhere else if you can.",

I ordered the spicy pork chop with rice, which was labeled as \"hot and spicy\" on the menu but it was neither hot nor spicy. It still tasted good though. The only spice kick I got was from eating the actual peppers themselves, which still didn't really do a whole lot. The pork was crispy but would've been nice if there was more. Still, for the price it seemed about right.",

I want beef chow fun, and since it was Chinese or another kebab, Chinese it is. \u00a0The security guard gave us the look, and asked us how many, luckily there was a table for the 6 of us available, and we were really drunk. My ABC buddy and I had the beef chow fun, and others ordered various noodles and fried rice dish, and everyone enjoyed it.It wasn't super nice, but given this is 3am, and I ate beef chow fun in a restaurant, 4 stars it is.",

    "text": "Hung's has been quite a long running Chinese restaurant in Chinatown compared to it's competitors yet it is the first time I'm venturing in to try their take on the Cantonese classics. I associate their restaurant more like a canteen, selling mainly one plate dishes from lunch to evening unlike some places that only sells one plate rice dishes at lunch. Their decor could do with a refurbish but the run down look gives it a bit of character and reminiscent of a lot of the places I dined in Hong Kong, From the front the restaurant looks quite small but it actually consists of three floors. Service was very friendly when we were there even after we witness a rude obnoxious table be rude to the staff members. A sad moment in my life.Stir fried spinach with garlicA fantastic executed dish, stir fried to release the fragrance of the garlic into the lovely young leafy spinach. The corn slurry helped thicken the sauce nicely so the spinach remained moist at all times. All perfectly seasoned so it can be eaten without rice. Wonton (pork & prawn) and roast duck egg noodle soupI really don't see the hype in this dish. The broth was so watery and bland I could not taste anything other than the juices of the wonton and duck that may have leaked into it. The noodles were fine but quite broken. Duck was quite tasteless but I appreciated how lean and meaty it was. Best part was the wonton itself, plump and filled generously with prawn giving that lovely sweetness to the dish. I suppose at \u00a36 it wasn't all that unreasonable. Beef Brisket Ho Fun soupOnce again the bland soup itself took all the joy away from the dish. The beef brisker varied from being dense and dry to some nice and succulent pieces where there was a large chunk of fat present. Quite generous in meat though. However with such a weak soup it didn't do much justice to the lovely fresh ho fun, which obviously gave off minimal flavour on it's own. Had to pour in a couple of soy sauce and chili oil to add some flavour and complexity to the dish. Such a shame.Mixed three kinds of barbecue with steamed riceProbably the most satisfying main dish out of the three ordered. The roast pork belly was my favourite, nice fresh crispy skin with a good layer of fat before reaching the lovely tender leaner meat. Char siu wasn't bad but could have been marinated and roasted longer to give it a richer sweeter and savoury flavour and roasted flavour. Duck like mentioned before was lean and meaty but also wasn't roasted long enough to soak up the sweet soy marinate. Luckily what made this superior to the rest was that it had helped from the remaining marinade sauce drizzled over to give it more flavour, especially when eaten with the rice. Hung was quite disappointing but I couldn't help but think I might have ordered their weaker dishes and should have stuck with their rice dishes or main dishes to share with rice. Still it's not an excuse. Might consider giving it another go seeing their other reasonable one plate rice dishes costing around \u00a36.20 to \u00a39.50 seeing how good their wok skills were with their greens. Still I say to avoid their noodle soup dishes unless you've had better and can tell me it was an off day because you've had better.",

Wouldn't say the best compare to some other Chinese restaurants I've been in china town but a few of their staffs are quiet friendly so I tend to go back and have a chat with them. I do prefer sitting downstairs than upstairs as its a bit stuffy upstairs. I would recommend this place if you just want a quick casual meal before heading out partying or even to a show.",

Their specialty is their meat dishes but they are a little on the light side when it comes to meat. The greens were super generous and garlic-y. We used the excess garlic on our rice that the meat came with, as meat/rice/sauce ratio was very plain rice heavy. 1:7:1.A little dirty and toilets not flash. Lots of discarded plates with chewed bones lying around with a couple of insect fans. They also set our table with forks. Service was pretty slow.Won't go back.",

Although most of the Chinese restaurants (including this one) have the roasted pig and duck in the viewing window roasting, this one stuck out, especially also being that the place didn't close until 4 am.So for food here, me and my wife shared some Kung pao chicken (a big portion and probably the best Kung pao chicken I have ever had) and some chicken fried rice (pretty good). The only negative thing I can say is that the soy sauce here is extremely salty. However, that is not enough to sway me from 5 stars.",

Stairs smell a mix of bleach and oil. Sounds not nice but whenever we visited, the place was always busy. You feel that its a place for tourist groups, fast food taste, very quick service and staff stares at you when you finish your food meaning to leave. Sometimes you even receive the bill without asking. It has extensive menu like the others in Chinatown. Crispy aromatic duck is seriously tasty! But I find the mains oily. After all our visits I can say that the service, quality is descending.",
