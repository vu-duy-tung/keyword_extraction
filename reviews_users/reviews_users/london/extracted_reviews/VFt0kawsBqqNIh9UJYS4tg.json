A good find anywhere, but in a busy part of London, a godsend! It's basically an olde coaching Inn, rebuilt in 1676 following a fire in Southwark (I guess the same one that led to the nearby Anchor being rebuilt too). Just about survived the death of coaching and now the national trust protects it. There are various different bar areas and they offer a decent selection of ales and friendly staff to pour them for you. As with most good pubs, the worst thing about them is how busy they get and so this venue is no exception. The outside area expands the available space but of course depends on our weather. If the weather is Ok though, it's the place to be.",

Owned by National Trust and the last galleried coach pub in London, this establishment has outlasted its peers by a long measure. A Dickens haunt, the place appeals differently in different parts of the pub. While the main bar and the immediately adjacent rooms might give it a fairly anonymous air, like any old pub in London, the room at the right hand side of the main bar has an old world charm to it, perhaps due to the uneven flooring or the wooden benches. It could even be the dimness of the room or the conspicuous absence of ambient music. This room is definitely my favourite for it allows for the two primary things for which one goes to a pub (or well, at least I do) - peaceful appreciation of one's beer or wine or whatever one fancies and some good ol' hearty conversation. This place has become a weekly haunt for the past few weeks and their mulled wine and chips are a comfort on bitterly cold winter nights. Unfortunately, I am yet to have a meal here so I have no opinions on their kitchen yet.",

    "text": "This is a gem of a pub, steeped in history. Shakespeare used to get trollied here. Dickens mentions the place in at least two of his books. The pub is the oldest galleried pub in the capital, and the oldest coaching inn. And because it's Grade I listed, it's kept more or less its appearance. You can see old photos on the wall from the 19th century if you don't believe me. It looks the same.It's also a great pub to go to in the summer, if it's not raining, until closing time at 11pm after which there are plenty of late-night bars to go to in the vicinity. I used to drink here every day, when I was working in the area, although now I only tend to go occasionally. I often include it on my pub-crawl route which I do every year on my birthday.It used to be really expensive, but while they haven't put their prices down, the other pubs have caught up with them. I think it's about \u00a34.20 a pint, which is very expensive of course, but it feels more justifiable given the beauty of the place.The Old Bar (on the right, westernmost side of the inn) is by far the most picturesque, with its really old interior, tables that are at a huge slant, and a real log fire. It's also normally quicker to get served there, assuming it is open. The new bar is not so nice, and they've really spoilt it (I remember it before). I'm surprised they were allowed to make the adjustments they did.But to be honest, I never sit inside unless it's raining. The courtyard is too lovely to miss. Food is poor. I have twice been tempted by food there, and twice been sorely disappointed. It always looks lovely, but tastes very bland. Better eat somewhere else instead. If you come to London, and want to visit nice pubs, this one HAS to be on your list.",

If you find it crowded and hard to find a seat, look harder and ask a to share tables; I've always found the crowds to be very friendly, even though we've had a case of beer spillage once! As for the food, I can't vouch for it since I've never been here for a meal (I mean, Borough Market is right across the street!).

If you're forced to sit inside on a nice night though, the bleak lighting and awkward setups of some of the ground floor rooms can make conversation a bit depressing. We ordered some charcuterie plates which were just OK, considering the prices we paid for them.

    "text": "Meeting up with friends in London after work I wasn't sure where we'd end up (I have next to no knowledge of decent watering holes there). So hopping off the tube at London Bridge and after only a short walk, the George Inn is tucked down a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cobbled alley and you immediately get transported back a couple of centuries (if you ignore the legions of folks sitting by the patio heaters 'smirting'). Inside it's on the pokey side but that adds to its charm. Loved the place. And Charles Dickens apparently frequented it in his day (though I'm sure several hundred other establishments could claim the same). Recommend you try the house's IPA (George IPA, really easy to remember).",

It was tucked away off the main road in Borough, and though it took a bit to find, it's got a huge patio space and two indoor seating areas to keep you preoccupied. They have a standard service bar, and are basically a good place to pop in along the east end of the Southbank. It's close to Borough market, as many have pointed out, which makes it extra convenient if the market doesn't take all your money. It's the kind of place, with authentic furniture and mismatched chairs and lots of weird nooks and crannies to sit in, which feels so authentic that you forget you're in the shade of the Shard.",

The building would have spanned around the perimeter of the courtyard originally, which over the years has been turned into some awful modern buildings which I wish hadn't been built because it would have been great to see the whole historic building still in tact. Perfect for summer nights to sit outside (and they do have heaters), though i have to agree with Li-mei about the workers giving you the death stare when they're about to close, if they're that bent on getting out on time they should stop serving a little earlier cause we had full drinks a couple of times and they were shouting at us. But assuming you aren't closing the place down, it's a must-see. It's one of those places that reminds me why I love living in London.",

So in the hunt for this, a group of friends and I headed down to the George Inn to sit in their huge courtyard. If you weren't already aware of it, the George Inn has something of a history behind it and is even mentioned in some one Shakespeare's work - I'm just dishing out the facts today aren't I?! As you take a seat and join the many other Londoners and tourists look up and you can almost imagine the wenches hanging off the balconies in those days. \"Cam on darlin', buy me an ale and I'll show ye a merry time!\" Something like that anyway. But yes, I like this pub, they have a wonderful summery house ros\u00e9 but it will cost you over a fiver for a glass. This is a tourist trap, that will be why.So if you want to eat and drink in an proper British pub with some serious history, you really can't go wrong with this place.",

The area has cobblestones throughout with benches and heaters if you want to stay warm while you have a drink and/or smoke in the cold. The pub feels very old as well with low its ceilings. Service was fast the last few times I have visited, so no complaints there.The one complaint I do have is with the bathroom. The men's bathroom is outside and that alone sounds dreadful when it's cold outside. The women's bathroom has gross old carpet in it. Carpet?! Yes, carpet. Grim.",

It's clientele are majority friendly locals, and those just looking for a decent British meal and a good pint.Pre warning - this place is always always busy but there's plenty of room both inside and out (outdoor heaters - woo!) and the staff are never short of a smile, I insist that you visit if in the area....And grab a pie and chips while you're at it.

The Chef had pre cooked everything and were just left on the hot plate in the kitchen to be served up, so people ended up paying for half a plate.

Looks lovely inside and the outside is easy on the eye too, especially when the sun is setting.As a part time ale drinker, they always have a different selection on tap to keep you on your toes.If you are looking for a seat, you need to get here before the office bods get out of work around 4ish, especially on a Friday as it got packed, but it's a lovely way to spend an hour or two before you jump on the train.",

I know, what a wuss.. it was early in the day and what I was looking for was a warm meal. \u00a0I got the chicken special and mashers. \u00a0Both did the trick.If you are heading out to have a few pints in SE London, this would be a must stop along the way.",

I distinctly remember trekking up the street to find it. I remember the interlocking rooms, the low ceilings and fireplaces creating a romantic atmosphere of the past time. I was in awe just soaking in the fact that this place has stood for over ...336 years! \u00a0A humbling reminder of how little you are in the grand scheme of things.While I was reflecting on this, I also noticed that 10 minutes had passed by wondering how the serviced worked here (2nd day in London and first time in an authentic British pub). After finding out from my table neighbour, I went to the bartender and placed my order. When he asked me what table I was at, I had quite the blank face....I had to go back and take a look at my table number. Oh so embarrassing. Wonderful thing that absolutely no one was keeping score, or cared!I ordered half a pint of ale (enjoyed it) and the Sunday roast. It was a bit dry, if I must be honest, but I was hungry and quite enjoyed it. Could I eat that regularly? Maybe not.",

The service is ok, but the smell of stale beer inside is kinda a bit grim so perhaps a good clean/dose of febreeze might be helpful here?!Again, decently priced drinks (Im obviously just used to ridic Canary Wharf prices), and good atmosphere so, I've already been back here a few times :)",

Enjoyed a couple of pints in the middle inside bar, then went outside to enjoy the patio since it was a nice warm October day. Weren't many people here, maybe about 8 all together, so it didn't have that convivial pub \"vibe\" at that time. It was a work day, and we were there at an odd time, so that's understandable. We ordered the buttermilk chicken sandwich to split, and it was quite tasty, but not the best I've had either. Still, it a nice little spot to appreciate the history around you. I would like to come back again when the place is more busy. If you're looking for that historic pub atmosphere, with really good food and a nice view as well, I highly recommend the Mayflower.",

The building itself is on three levels, complete with balconies. Inside, it is very warm and cosy with a choice of numerous rooms in which to relax and enjoy your drinks.

One of my favorite meals in an 8-day UK trip. Yes, it's a Greene King corporate operation now, but still has plenty of history and character and family-friendly. We were blessed with good weather that Saturday, so we enjoyed our lunch on one of the many picnic tables out in the beer garden courtyard patio. Busy, but not so packed that you couldn't find seats. At least one friendly local offered to share. I don't believe that there's a kids' menu, but my son enjoyed his giant hot dog and my daughter liked her beef pie, which was served with traditional tasty roast carrots and parsnips. I liked my \u00a35.95 fish finger sandwich- good value. Note your table number and order in the Main Bar. Pleasant service from the food runner.",

Fish and chips and meat pie were about 12\u00a3 each. I had the pie which had a really nice flavor inside and the crust was outstanding. I got chips instead of mash and only ate a few but it wasn't because they weren't good. It was just a lot of food. The veggies were also very tasty. I liked that there were carrots with the peas to add some more color to my meal. My husband said his fish and chips were really good. He finished everything on his plate... great sign!

Yelp told us about the George, which had really great reviews. Plus they had Sunday Roast, which was something I wanted to try while I was in the UK, so we decided to venture on over. There wasn't a wait for our group of 4 on a Sunday at around 7.I ordered (as might have already guessed) the Sunday Roast. The meat was dry and chewy. My friend ordered the same thing, but well done - so I can only imagine the workout that her jaw had. My other two friends ordered something else, I can't remember what - but they were drenched in the same gravy as the Sunday Roast, so everything ended up tasting the same. The atmosphere seemed to have that authentic pub experience - old with some charm. Unfortunately, the food was just old, without any charm.",

What I got was two very dry and overcooked steaks, skinny fries and peas mixed with stewed cabbage all covered with gravy. I went and asked for my Yorkshire pudding and didn't bother complaining about the rest of the food. The YP was nice. My hubby and friend both got fish and chips. Again, enormous meals. The fish was nice but there was far too much batter. And again with the skinny fries. It's England people, I want proper chips!!

The pub itself had plenty of tables and space, but if it's a nice day, I can definitely see one sitting outside to enjoy a pint or food.We visited in the late afternoon on a Friday and the place wasn't crowded, but there was a good amount of people inside.still. As with all pubs, we ordered at the bar after taking a seat inside the pub. We ordered the Fish & Chips and Shin of Beef & Ale Pie.Fish & Chips The hand-battered cod was served with deviled whitebait, crushed peas, bread & butter and chips. The cod was good, but nothing extraordinarily memorable, but it's not to say it wasn't flavorful still. Same could be said about the chips. As for the crushed peas, it was an interesting side as I had never tasted it before. The texture was almost like mash. The deviled whitebait was a nice palette changer, as even though it was fried, it had a very different flavor than the cod.Shin of Beef & Ale Pie (Served with potatoes & fresh vegetables)In summary, the beef and ale pie was a pot pie. The presentation was very nice and it was served on top of a healthy serving of mash and fresh vegetables. The pie was really good, filled with plenty of beef. The vegetables and mash underneath went really well with the gravy from the pie.In a very busy area, I had no regrets about going to The George for a lunch pit stop. The spacing was plentiful and the food was good. That's all we could have asked for since we were starving prior to our stop here.",

This beautiful old coach inn has suffered from an unsympathetic modernisation, perhaps so the managers can better cater for the crush of rowdy med students who descend on it every night. We sat under the harsh glare of spotlights in an extension. Wine list was terrible - there was only one wine by the glass, and for \u00a33.50 we were served miniature bottles of very poor quality red wine (as if you were being served on a plane). We were served by a surly skinhead who refused to enter into any discussion about the wine (although he did taste it and make a face), and was later seen laughing about us with another customer. We were forced to buy an entire bottle of red to get anything drinkable. The whole experience was so unfriendly and sad that it wrecked our night. We later wrote a letter to the National Trust (who are the leaseholders). It's a real shame that a place of such historical importance has been turned into a moneymaking pub with no respect for itself.",

    "text": "I have to agree with the reviewer below, they have changed it and not all for the better. Sunday again it's time for South Bank pub crawl with a slight diversion for The George Inn. It has some good ales (it did have a lot of good ales) and it's the people drinking there gives it the atmosphere which makes you want to come back. Staff, oh dear. All I know if their were having a drama on Sunday (kitchen staff) which also effect the bar and floor staff. Saying that our chips were good. This pub will still be visited by us but in the hope that something could be improved. 4 star for the pub, 3 star for the drinks, 2 stars at least for the barmaid who made us laugh while the others around her were flapping",

Some one in a marketing department (I don't mean to sound scornful, but I am so that's how it comes across) have done The George. Proper computer screen tills, the beer has taken a plummet, the staff have lost their manners and the menu. dear Lord the menu! A pub that used to be a bastion of good, old-school pub food has sold out to poncey ciabatta's, Mediterranean wraps, the same old knackers you can find in any third rate pub. And maybe I'm being unfair. Maybe I am the only person who likes a ham sandwich with a handful of crisps at lunch rather than a cherry-tomato-and-mozzarella-style-cheese sandwiched-between-gently-toasted-ciabatta-rolls, or a bit of home made pie, or for the bar man to gladly ask chef if he can knock up a bacon sandwich rather than flatly intone It's not on the till. Can't do it. Seriously. What is the difference between a beef-burger and an Angus Rump Patty? (About \u00a33 the dearer, and 6oz the poorer apparently.) And I want it in a burger bun not a friggin ciabatta! Look, it's still an alright boozer, great place to go for a drink and a chat. The building still has bags of character, and I would rate it at 3 stars were it not for the fact that it used to be SO much better and more pleasant. I'm thoroughly depressed. I'd go for a pint and a sandwich but I'm scared the Porter will have gone robins up by the time I get there. ---------------------------PREVIOUS REVIEWRapidly elevated to top 5 in my favourite pubs in London mental list. Spacious, friendly, good food, reasonably priced, good provenance (if it's good enough for Mr. Dickens), admittedly very busy later on in the week but surely that's testament to it's merits. Nice house beer as well, if you like that kind of thing. One of the few pubs in town where you can get what I describe as good, honest, straight forward pub food.",

Set around a large courtyard just off Borough High Street, this is a three storey building with balconies that were for performances in the courtyard back in the older times. Amazing real ales and fantastic atmosphere, the slightly hidden aspect of the place keeps the clientele interesting and has managed to gather an unusual group of regulars. My son is one of them. Really good place to sit outside in the summer, far removed from the noise of Borough. Can`t recommend enough, but keep your eyes along Borough High Street if you have any hopes of finding it.",

The topics of conversation? Anything from the previous night's housewarming gifts (out of a skip), to is cat the opposite of dog? and of course, best places to go in London. Gordon's on Villiers Street was mentioned as a favourite London institution and after visiting the George Inn, pre-party, on Saturday night - I'd put it in the same cateogry. This is just one of those pubs that oozes England and history out of every floorboard and beam - but not in a Shakespeare gift-shop tea towel kind of way. Tucked away down a little alley off Borough High Street the outside is overflowing with tables perfect for summer drinking. I was attending a party and a room had been hired, so I ducked in to find a glorious little space with beams and wood and tables, a darling little hatch which serves as a bar and plenty of smiley party goers. Friendly staff completed the package - the next sunny day there is I'll be back, and hopefully outside drinking Pimm's! There I go, being English again",

What it certainly is, is an old, wooden, multi-roomed pub. Plenty of real ales on tap, including one brewed just for them. There are nooks and crannies everywhere, from stools to tables to benches. There's a dining room upstairs, and some function rooms. The kitchen serves a good menu. There are lots of picnic tables in the cobbled courtyard for outside drinking when the weather is good. The men's toilet is in a small outbuilding across the courtyard. The George Inn is often very busy, and if the weather's not good enough to allow people to spill outside you're likely to find yourself standing. Still, despite being in a busy part of town its location down the alley separates it from traffic and noise. It's definitely worth a visit.",

Or, rather, I love its big courtyard and the bar which opens through a hatch to the outside, so you don't need to battle in to the main saloon to stock up on drinks for the smokers. The building itself is low and dark and oozing with London history, but you do need to position yourself quite carefully so that your view of it isn't ruined by the modern office blocks that make up the other three sides of the courtyard. As it's slightly further away from the city than haunts like the Mudlark or the Anchor, the George has that slight air of secretiveness, and you feel rather clever for knowing about it, but visit in mid-summer and you will find you are not the only Londoner who knows about its outdoor charms and leaded-window delights.",
