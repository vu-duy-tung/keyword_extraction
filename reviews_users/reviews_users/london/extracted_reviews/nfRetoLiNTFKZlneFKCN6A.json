Even if I hadn't ben ravenous when I got there I would've enjoyed it. That being said, the food is a party in your mouth. I don't eat beef so I can't speak to eject traditional burger, but the chicken was cooked to perfection. Cheese thank hand-made skin on chips to go with. Be prepared for food coma. Glorious, cheese induced, food coma.",

I went for the Skinny Burger, i.e. the one without a bun. Instead I got a fantastic salad with an amazing dressing that really knocked me off my socks. The burger came with toppings of avocado, mushrooms and cheese, and went down well \u00a0I wish we had a burger company like this in Germany! Def will come back on my next visit to London. I will then, however, make sure to either visit another branch or snatch a table in the comfortable section further away from the kitchen. We were sitting on an extremely narrow table amidst the kitchen exhausts and smelled like freshly grilled burgers ourselves afterwards. This \u00a0and the slow paying process, almost forgot about that - is the only reason I can't give 5 stars this time, everything else was just fine!",

My personal favorite is the corn-fed chicken burger - something about the marinade hits the spot perfectly; when combined with a slice of mature cheddar and a side of onion rings (or potatoes, depending on your fancy), it makes a lethal late-night snack. I've rarely had to wait for a table here, so makes a good choice for a spur of the moment meal - despite the lack of wait time, the restaurant is lively and often full of people. A point to note: sides are portioned quite small - without prices to match. Don't expect to get full on just one.",

The portion of fries were also on the small size however they were good ole fashioned french fries not chips masquerading as fries so i was happy to give up quantity for quality. In total the meal was genuinely good. If there is one sidebar comment that must be noted - the burger was a bit on the salty side but otherwise a solid performance. Unlike Burger King next door where you will get a super sized portion without having to shell out some serious sterling to eat a slice of Americana, the price spent (which was around \u00a315 for a burger, fries and coke) was well worth the cost. It is rather expensive when I translate this to American $$$, but when you are craving a burger and want something home spun, Byron hits a home run!",

I ordered the blue cheese burger. I was interested to compare it to GBK and it certainly avoids the slightly unusual features of the latter I.e paying before you eat. The burgers areone size at Byron but you can get doubles. The menu says burgers are all medium unless you want it done differently. I was asked and said medium. When it came it was redder than medium. It was ok. The meat is clearly good quality but, unlike GBK, the blue cheese was a smattering of dressing. In GBK you can get actual cheese. I couldn't taste it. The chips were good but the onion rings were all batter. In my view GBK has the edge though there was nothing to actually complain about. Service was good. Next time, I'll cover that extra 30 yards to GBK I think.",

The burgers were ok , but I am not convinced they are the best possible, for a place that claims to specialise in them. Mine was fairly plain, even with the Byron sauce, that sounds great, but actually a bit devoid of taste.Good for kids etc, and so would happily go back. A different experience to my visit to the Soho branch (reviewed seperately), which I would not repeat.",

Byron was always my answer, as while the Gloucester Rd. stop was right by my school, I could always be sure I would find a Byron burger in almost every borough I was in. A cool design element is that each one is decorated differently, and slightly reflects the area it is in (The other south kensington branch is just around the corner but looks much more posh and classic, mirroring the expensive flats surrounding it).I've had the cheese burger, Byron burger, and chicken burger - all fantastic and cooked right to order. I had friends who got the B-rex burger during that monthly promotion and loved it! Their seasonal burgers are definitely ones to try. I also always ordered a side of fries or mac and cheese (because I'm American of course), and the mac and cheese was pretty much to die for. The milkshakes were also great diner food to go along with the burger and fries - Try the oreo cookie milkshake!Very quick service in every location. I would call as I walked out of classes to order something to go, and by the time I got there it was always ready - never more than 20 min!",

We received our hamburgers and onion rings soon after we ordered and they were great. My boyfriend got a normal cheeseburger and I got the Byron (if that's the bacon cheeseburger). We were both quite impressed with the hamburgers, but it was the onion rings that were the \"wow\" factor. We actually came back the next day just to get more onion rings.

The state of the bread was a slight disappointment as it crumbled and lacked the chewiness of a real good bun. The patty was cooked medium (medium-well-ish) and had a pink center but was still rather dry when I cut into it. The texture was that of a well done patty, just pink. The condiments were excellent though and the \"Byron sauce\" had a nice flavor \u00a0to it. For sides we went with the home made skin-on chips which were excellent, nice flavor, and the onion rings which where a bit too greasy.The service was excellent but the food was just a slight disappointment.

The sides were also really good and we generally got a couple and shared them. I really liked the fries, homemade skin-on chips, and onion rings. They all were seasoned well and had really great flavor. We also tried the tortilla chips with guacamole, which were delicious as well. As for drinks I generally had the lemonade which was really delicious.Although their burgers were a little bit expensive, the burgers were so fantastic that we splurged here once in a while for their fantastic burgers. When my mom came over to visit this is one of the first places I took her to and she loved it as well.I highly recommend Byron for their food!",

I ate at the Gloucester Road location and it was not busy so the service was incredibly fast and our waitress was pleasant and attentive. I had the bean burger and it was exceptional -- the patty was crispy on the outside and a wonderful texture on the inside (which you don't always get in a vegetarian option). The fries here, in my own personal opinion, are perfection. They're cut thin and are crisp without being dry, and they also aren't too oily -- I detest a mushy french fry. My friends and I also shared an order of onion rings, and I think it's worth mentioning that they are INCREDIBLY rich. I could only eat two, and my two friends each only had one. So if your table is feeling onion rings, I would recommend starting with one order and asking for more later if you need them. All in all, Byron provides a solid burger experience.",

So when I do have a burger out, the bar is set so high that usually they don't compare, but not this time! The burger was SO good I finished the entire burger along with the zucchini fries (courgette fries) omg Yum! I also had to go here since my love dog in the States is named Byron! 5 star and our waitress Viviana was absolutely the best \u00a0#viviana #Byron burger. Just GO! You won't be disappointed! Thank you! Gaynelle",

The beef is thin and dry. Sides are pricey and aren't included in your order. The fries were okay, but the zucchini fries were limp. People bring their kids here, so it gets a bit loud inside.",

Went there after joining their burger club (which got us a free burger) we got to sample their newest addition to the menu, 'sweet caroline' which had all sorts of beef and pulled pork deliciousness! it was huge! Also tried the vegetarian bean burger patty which we had with cheddar cheese and accompanied by skinny fries (which were really good!) We went there hoping to get a bottle of prosecco but they were out after a busy weekend which was a little disappointing but it was all sweetened by the bottle of Malbec and the complimentary olives we got instead!The actual restaurant has a really cool vibe and its a good place to go and catch up with friends! Highly recommend it..",

The bus dropped us off next to Gloucester Road tube station, so we decided to grab a burger here before heading to our flat.The service was extremely helpful here. My wife has a gluten allergy, and the server was completely understanding and helped us find an option that was safe and delicious (any burger can be \"skinny\" with no bun and a salad added). The size of the burger was perfect for us - a 6 ounce patty is just right when you omit the bun. It was cooked just right, too.We weren't expecting much, but I think we would actively seek out Byron again if we were looking for a burger. It was yummy.",

The wifey was full from lunch today and I spotted this smaller location down the road from where we are staying at The Rydges. I ordered the Chilli Queen and I think I loved it even more, spicy on a well cooked patty with a little of that charred flavour I adore, with delicious melted American jack cheese. Amazing!!I might look in to franchising rights for Australia!",

Gizz-Mo burger created by Gizzi Erskine in honoregistered MovemberWelsh, a Welsh Rarebit with cheddar and Worcestershire sauce with a 50p donation to the cause. I'll go with a Byron to try his special sauce.It's a simple, meat market feel with white tile floors and walls. Blank walls without art and sparse lighting make it a drab feel. The only spice is on the table in the form f Cholula hot sauce. Not sure how many Londoners use it but they should.I've tried burgers from various joints around LDN and the tops would be Gourmet and Byron. Both have fairly similar but I would say Bryon is closer to the State's staple meal. I don't get the onion rings. The light batter with herbs an pepper does not make a proper ring. Not sure what it is but I'm no fan. The french fries looked better. All together me meal was \u00a315.45 and worth it. I would return to sample other burgers with fries and try a shake. Those too look good.",

Luckily, or not so luckily for my waistline, I have a branch literally 5 minutes from my office so I often head there with my colleagues to indulge in one of my favourite meals!The chilli burger contains a 6oz hamburger smothered with green chilli, American cheese, shredded iceberg and chipotle mayonnaise and I always order extra avocado to go inside. As a rule i order my steaks rare and my burgers medium rare. I like my beef \u00a0to be still moo-ing when it hits my plate. The burgers at Byron always come perfectly cooked with the right balance of pink and charring to add flavour.One of the other draws to Byron, aside from the namesake burgers , is the courgette fries. Trust me, once you've tried these, you won't ever order regular fries again! they are basically soft and juicy courgette stripes fried tempura style in a light, crispy batter....all that you need is a nice glass of Fentimans ginger beer to wash it all down! absolute perfection!",

So, as an American, hell, as a Texan, I know good burgers. And this Byron burger was up there with any other quality gourmet burger I've had in the states. The vegetables seemed fresh, the meat was of good quality, I believe Scottish cows, and the cheese, bun and Byron's sauce all were very nice. I got the courgette fries (fried zucchini) where also very tasty (as a Texan I grew op on fried squash). Also, they have a good selection of beers and a few American IPAs like Odell's IPA from Colorado (scored very high on beer advocate and ratebeer). Burgers, beer, this American has no complaints. I came to see that these places are all over London but for a chain place, it's definitely 5 stars.",

I always get a bit suspicious when i see \"American\" restaurants, since most people in the USA can't tell you what an \"American\" restaurant looks like. \u00a0However, this place is a great burger joint, something is Americans are VERY familiar with. Good burgers with great options, an excellent beer selection, and some very legit milkshake options. Very attentive, friendly staff, and a good burger joint ambiance. A great place to fill those low key cravings.",

We were greeted and seated right away, taken our drink order and our meal order quickly! We loved the service the best service we've had since being in London. We ordered the nachos to start off and they were soooo goood. It was way better then we had expected. To drink I had a strawberry milkshake that had real strawberry bits inside... YUM. We were brought water without asking which hadn't been done at any other place we've eaten in London.I had the E-Rex burger medium cooked and it was to die for. The portion sizes are rather big so I'd recommend sharing. Overall, we had a wonderful experience because our waitress went above and beyond from the beginning.",

    "text": "I stopped in Byron while visiting London. After being in London for the better part of six days, I was in desperate need of some kind of American food. I stumbled upon Byron and I smiled instantaneously. In America, we love our burgers. so I was curious to see how Byron measured up according to my taste buds.As I scanned the menu, I saw that the burgers were slightly expensive. I said to myself, \"oh well, I'm I tourist\". I ordered a fresh squeezed lemonade at it was delicious. Its really difficult to master a good fresh squeezed lemonade. It was definitely worth a try. The menu had a nice selection of alcoholic beverages to choose from as well. For my burger entree I ordered the Double Bacon Cheese burger with a side of skin on fries. The burger was eh.....ok I guess. I wish I could have added lettuce to it but I was starving and was just happy to have some American food for the first time during my stay.The Byron Sauce is what stood out to me. It was so tasty that I asked my waitress if I could purchase a couple of bottles to take back home with me to the states. She looked at me stated that they weren't for sale and nobody has made that request to her before.At that point there was no way I was leaving the restaurant without a bottle of Byron Sauce. So I called the Manager over to my table and let him know that I wanted to buy a few bottles to take home. He said \"of course we sell our bottles of Byron sauce\". So he charged me a few bucks for two bottles. I forgot to mention that the manager had the most EPIC handlebar mustache I've seen. He was very helpful in making that upsell.Overall, it was an ok experience. Byron served its purpose for me during my visit. I've had better burgers at home. When I come back to London, I will visit Byron for sure....only to buy a few bottles of Byron Sauce. (Not unless I can order it online)",

Located right across the street from the Gloucester Road station it's really easy to find. \u00a0And around 12:30 on a Sunday there were plenty of seats.Byron's is modern, yet comfortable. \u00a0Staff is friendly and they make up a mean burger. \u00a0Both the Hubs and I ordered the BYRON Burger - with bacon, cheddar, shredded iceberg, tomato, red onion and Byron sauce. \u00a0At \u00a39.25 the dish doesn't come with fries which is a bit of a bummer, and in turn a bit expensive. \u00a0But we made sure to add a couple sides to try. \u00a0The fries (\u00a32.95) were mighty tasty. \u00a0The order come in a nice size bowl that's easy to share. \u00a0We also ordered up the courgette fries (fried zucchini sticks) (\u00a33.25). \u00a0I didn't love these...I guess I'd rather just stick to fresh/crisp zucchini instead of fried. \u00a0Hubs liked them though.We ended with milkshakes to go. \u00a0Yum.We spent about \u00a332 ($55) on two burgers, two sides and two shakes. \u00a0Which, generally, is a bit expensive for us but overall - Byron's a really good meal. \u00a0Burger was seasoned nicely and cooked as asked. \u00a0Soft bun. \u00a0And I'm usually not fan of \"secret sauces\" but this one is really tasty, don't go without it.",
