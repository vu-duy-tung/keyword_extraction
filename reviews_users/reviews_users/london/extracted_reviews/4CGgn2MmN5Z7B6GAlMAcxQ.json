Service is warm, friendly, and accommodating. Highly recommend.",

Although there was no Korma on the menu, I would gladly return to try more of UK's infamously stellar cuisine.We did sit next to a couple that appeared to be on a first date which is always amusing. They commented on liking the food as well.Kahdi ghost (spicy but not hot)Karai chicken (wonderfully peppered)Kingfisher (typical Indian lager)Naan (plain just as it should be)Souffle (the waiter was confused when we ordered this as he asked if we were sure we wanted to try this \"Indian\" dessert.

On our last night in the city, we wanted to drive the latter from our minds. Encouraged by the first review, we came to the Mango Tree. It was terrific, in every way: friendly, stylish, and with a flair for making every bite complex and wondrous. We returned to our lodgings with bellies full, smiles broad, and a happy place where the memories of another establishment's atrocious curry ceased to be.Please, go and enjoy.",

    "text": "The Mango tree sits tucked away on Redcross way, only a couple of minutes walk away from Vinopolis, Borough Market and the Thames. The restaurant only opened about a year ago, but I've been visiting many times since then. Compared to some of the other Indian restaurant locally, the Mango tree has a more attractive, and modern interior, with leather seats. The glass front to the restaurant lets in plenty of light during the daytime. Relaxing modern music with an Indian influence plays in the background (similar to Talvin Singh, although the waiter claimed it wasn't). The staff are really nice and welcoming, and every time we go back they treat us like old friends, although I have no idea if they actually recognise me or not! The menu is pretty big and includes many of the standard dishes you find in most Indian restaurants, but have a look at the specials section for the real treats. My only criticism is that on my last couple of visits I've ordered lamb dishes and found the lamb to be too tough. Other dishes on offer have been much better. The flavour of the sauces are excellent. Prices are about average for this area, with main course curries costing around \u00a37, specials \u00a310. Small chocolates and a hot towel are provided on paying the bill.",

The staff were very attentive and earnest in ensuring that we had everything we needed.The food was great - from the Papadum (large cracker dish with dipping sauces) to the King Prawn Mango Massala. You can't go wrong with Tikka Massala (an Indian dish at its best in London). And, the Sagg Paneer was simply the best I've had anywhere. It wasn't oily and the cheese was obviously made fresh.I highly recommend this if you're anywhere near the Borough Market or Southwark area.",

Sleek interior with very, very comfortable seating. friendly service. southern style dishes - lots of coconut + cashew seasoned items. we had a meat curry, veg curry, some rice, nan. fresh, flavorful, delicious. only complaint is about the nan. it's a really small portion and might just be store bought. very reminiscent of what i get at the grocery store and throw in the oven... otherwise, it's a decent, more upmarket style Indian place. prices reflected.",

The place looks a little out of place but it's cozy and has some great food!We started with some tea and then ordered the lunch special with 2 items which was a pretty good deal. We both ordered the chicken tikka masala and got the lamb and chicken starters. We also got the vegetable of the day included with our meal which was okra. Oh, we didn't forgot about naan! We ordered a side of garlic naan as well!The whole meal didn't take too long to come out and \u00a0everything was really delicious! The tikka masala had a more tomatoe-y tang that was more prominent in this dish then I was used too but it was still very delicious. The okra had great flavors to it and the starters were flavorful and cook perfectly.Would love to come back for dinner to try other dishes!",

Not fast, not slow. The korma was sweeter than what we are used to, and the tikka misala was spicier than expected as well, but this just added to the variety and everything tasted great. We felt the price was reasonable too.Our female servers were nice, and the male manager was nice to us, but at one point he seemed angry and started arguing with one of his female staff. We couldn't tell what he was saying, but we felt bad for her, and it all really just seemed inappropriate and disrespectful.Maybe they were just having a stressful night. I hope that isn't the norm.

The entrees--the chicken and the lamb-- were both FANTASTIC. Delicious spices, tender meat, everything you hope for in a high quality Indian dinner. The naan was fluffy and incredibly light, and the rice was cooked perfectly. The samosas were kind of strange, they seemed to be wrapped in a phyllo dough rather than the thicker crust that I have always encountered when ordering samosas. But they tasted fine.My complaint about the service: we were put in a table in a corner that was wedged in very tightly, which made it an uncomfortable meal. I was disappointed that this happened, especially considering the restaurant was empty when we entered and remained so throughout the entire meal. Also, the server touched my silverware with his hands once when he was serving us, which grossed me out. Finally, the women's bathroom is incredibly small-- if you are taller than 5'6\", I don't think you would be able to sit on the toilet at all. The wall was literally inches from my nose!My tip: Mango Indian great food, but maybe opt for takeaway. ;)",

Located next to the famous marketplace, Mango Tree restaurant was better than any indian food I've had in the states. \u00a0It's not about the intensity of the flavor but also how balanced you make them...which Mango tree got spot on. \u00a0We came here during lunch and they had a nice prixe fixe lunch menu. \u00a0I don't quite remember how much each prixe fixe combo costed, but I remember it being really decent and easy on the wallet for the amount/quality of food you receive. \u00a0Chicken kabob: Solid appetizer. \u00a0Seek kabob: While the flavor was good, it was a bit on the dry side.Okra vegetable mix: This was absolutely fantastic. \u00a0Could have eaten this as a main dish by itself because it was so flavorful. \u00a0Chicken Tikka Masala : Very different than what I usually have in the states. \u00a0This one was much more flavorful and had less of an emphasis on cream. \u00a0I can tell they used a lot of ingredients in here because the sauce was quite chunky, akin to a puree of flavor. \u00a0Lamb : Not sure which one I ordered but it was really delicious and cooked exceptionally. \u00a0The lamb had very little gamey flavor to it. \u00a0Basmati rice: \u00a0Usually I don't rave about rice but this was great. \u00a0The rice was seasoned well and was extremely fragrant. \u00a0Who knew rice alone could have so much essence. \u00a0Garlic nhan: This didn't come with the set meal but is a must order. \u00a0Crispy and full of garlicy goodness.5 stars. \u00a0I'm extremely happy I found this place on yelp so don't miss this place!",

But it's nicely decorated and clean.Service: All of the servers were quite nice. Apparently the kitchen closes at 2:15 or so, and we arrived at about 2, so we felt kind of rushed when the server notified us we had just a few minutes to place any orders.Food: Quite good for the most part.-- Scallops were not mind-blowing (like Zaika's) but they were good.-- Aloo Tikki was too fried for me and the accompanying chickpeas were quite spicy. I don't recommend this dish.-- Rice was good.-- Daal was well received (didn't get to try it).-- Chicken was also well received (didn't get to try it).-- Roti was nice and fresh.-- Pear + sorbet dessert is refreshing and delicious. I highly recommend.Overall I would recommend Mango Tree, especially if you are in the Borough Market / London Bridge area. Not sure I'd seek it out again since it's not really convenient to our place though.",

We called an hour before and booked a table, upon arriving the staff told that they have allowed us to eat at their restaurant but we must vacate in 1-1.5hr (even though the restaurant was 90% empty). This is extremely demeaning when you called in advance, reserved a table and then giving us ultimatum upon arriving at your restaurant. Why did not you told us in the phone?? We were about to leave their restaurant so then manager said ok 1.5 hour we can give you, please get seated. We were tourists in London visiting from US and were very very tired as we walked all day in St. Paul cathedral, Tower of London, crossed tower bridge and then walked to this restaurant, so we said ok. Then we were never asked for water and after half hour upon asking, we got some water without any ice. We ordered food initially, after 15 mins we asked to add a small appetizer and the server called the manager who rudely said no he cannot do it as we already ordered! We saw that same appetizer was served to other table 10mins after our order was denied. We felt extreme bad, and wanted to leave but we already ordered and we are not as low as these restaurant people are on their behavior and commitment. So we stayed back. Basically these people are racist and are horrible of a staff! Don't go here at all! They are a big rip off! They sold 4 samosas of mini sizes to us for 12 pounds.. they added gratuity in the order under sales charge, and poor us not knowing their trick, we paid extra gratuity in cash as well, thinking they accommodated us, however we should have not, as 90% of the restaurant was still empty. Food was not great either. Moreover when we asked for some lemons with the food, they added 5pounds for some salad even without telling us at the time we asked. These people are really bad and a big rip off!",

Reminds me of the Vik's chaat in Berkeley, but here they add some berries that really compliments the dish. *Onion Bhajia - delicious. They could've given more of the chutney / dipping sauce. Main:* Chicken Chettinad - delicious. You could really taste the star anise. * Dum Biryani with Chicken - delicious as well. Dessert:* Gulab Janum with Vanilla Gelato - delicious. Loved the vanilla gelato. Although, I looked online and it looks like its vanilla ice cream. Overall the service was great. They were very kind and attentive. This place is amazing. This and Vik's Chaat in Berkeley are probably my top Indian places and they serve very different things. I would highly recommend this place to friends. I actually enjoyed this place a lot more than Dishoom. This was probably my best meal in London. Furthermore, the prices were really reasonable!TL/DR: This place is amazing.

When we walked in and asked for a table for two the first guy who greeted us pretended not to understand us then another guy came up and said we need a reservation because all of the tables are for reservations who for some reason are all happening at the same time. So random. I was like okay I get it you guys don't like Americans. I guess they don't need our business with all of the damn empty tables.",

The lamb chops for appetizer were amazing. I had super high hopes after eating the lamb chops. But the curry dishes just lacked the adventure and the complexity you love about Indian food. Everything went downhill after the lamb chops. I had high hopes since I looked at reviews and we hopped an Uber out here. Totally not worth it. There's an Indian place that's walking distance from where I live that I'd rather go to than make the trek out here. So basically, if you don't live by, don't bother.",

    "text": "Where do I begin? My husband was craving for Indian food while visiting London for the first time. We had such disappointment from another Indian restaurant of horrendous customer service that I wasn't too sure about stepping foot into another Indian restaurant. However, Mango Indian had a lot of great reviews on Yelp, so we decided to take a leap of faith. Thank God we did! I'm not crazy about Indian food to begin with, but Mango Indian took my breath away and made me look at Indian food in a whole new light. Mango Indian gives off a more upscale vibe and food can be a little pricier compared to other Indian restaurants we've ever been to. However, Mango Indian in Borough Market didn't disappoint. Here is what we ordered:Chicken Tikka Masala- Very good, a little on the sweeter side, but still creamy and the chicken was moist.Goan Fish- Taken away by this curry fish. I didn't know what I was going to be getting when I ordered this, but this was the best Indian dish I've ever had. It was so flavorful and tasty and every bite was sacred. Also comes with a lemon saffron kind of rice, which went great with the food!Garlic Naan- Smaller portions, but crispy and made to perfection.Vegetable Samosas- Looks can be deceiving. This starter dish came out and it looked smaller, but was extremely delicious and crispy with the lemon mint sauce that came with it. Comes with 2 samosas.All in all, Mango Indian in the UK was amazing, from service to food. We will be back for sure if we are ever back in London.",

    "text": "Food: We had lamb, hariyali chicken tikka, bread sampler, dahi baingon, chilli paneer and rice. You get two sizes large and small. We picked small (they were really small, like two servings). Had a Cobra beer and still waterPlain Naan was light and fluffy, garlic Naan was okay. Baingon( eggplant) was mild and creamy and paneer was meh. Lamb was good though the saalan( gravy) was spicy. Folks sitting in a table behind us had the same reaction, so beware if you don't like spicy lamb.Hariyali chicken tikka was juicy, mild and well marinated. Definitely the winner.Price: I am not sure if this is a British thing, but who charges for water!!!! C'mon folks. 4\u00a3 for a bottle of still water. That sucked.Service: Prompt, friendly, not stuffy.Total for 3: 76\u00a3 (ouch!)Would we go again: Probably but I would be smarter about the dishes we pick.",

The food service on ambiance was top notch. Appetizers we opted for the seafood plater which was fresh scallops that were so tender. The Somosa with lamb the flavors and the dough was just perfect. Main dishes we decided to split chicken jalfrazi which was spiced perfectly with capsicum and other spices, which went well with the nann bread. But the star of the night was the goan fish curry with lemon rice. The coconut flavors in the sauce just made your mouth sing. Let's just say I will be back this gem is amazing",
