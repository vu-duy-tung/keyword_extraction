    "text": "I came to this restaurant after watching a demonstration of their food on Sunday Brunch one morning. The food was beautifully explained and loved by the presenters. The reality of the restaurant with it's 1 Michelin hype and good reviews was incomparable. The restaurant is small and casual, not smart at all. The service was friendly but lacked lustre and petered off towards the end of our stay-not offered more drinks, waitress clearing plates from across the diners rather than walking around etc. Drinks took ages to arrive and the food........we went for the set menu, starter took a long time to arrive-some rubbish about the sauce being made fresh to order but even a hot sauce would take less time and it was only ceviche! The salmon ceviche was a tiny portion in a pretty nice but large amount of dressing served with a sweet puree, banana chips, micro coriander and nuts of some type-why so much sweet stuff? Main course for me was the grouse-overcooked but tasty, the pieces of meat themselves were 2 parts of a joint and they weren't even cut at the joint! Had an annoying sharp bone situation. The tiniest portions again. My friend had something with mushrooms that had no mushrooms in it, the waitress set it down as vegetable..... \u00a0 \u00a0and didn't bother to offer an explanation about the change. I went to a much more expensive establishment recently and the portions were bigger and offered service this place is far removed. This place is a waste of time, money and energy. For all the hype and money, I felt cheated. Never again. Avoid at any cost!",

    "text": "We have been there for dinner. As nobody of us has ever been to this place before, we were quite excited about tasting Peruvian Cuisine in London. I have been to an excellent Peruvian Restaurant in Cologne before. Sadly, we were very disappointed about this restaurant in London. It might be, that potatoes growing in 4000m height are a rarity which you can hardly find anywhere else, still this potato mash didn't taste very exciting because it wasn't seasoned at all and the texture was kind of strange. I have to admit, that the starters were ok, though. Still I would expect a portion which corresponds to the price of 8 GBP for a starter. But this is a matter of taste. What I want to say is, that this had nothing to do with real Peruvian cuisine. It is rather French cuisine with some South American ingredients. The portions were rather small and some things, mostly main dishes were not very well seasoned. When we asked for bread we were expecting something like corn bread or at least baguette, but we were served plain french brioche. Sorry, but why does one serve sweet bread for dinner???Plus, the late license is only until 11:30pm and nobody annouced a last round. When we wanted to order a bottle of champagne for a friends' birthday at 11:35 we were told it is no longer possible, because it was too late. Bad service.",

Great creative dishes are on offer in an intimate but buzzing space in Fitzrovia. Among the memorable dishes we tried were the salmon tiradito and seared lomo (steak) for starters and the lamb shoulder and suckling pigs for shareable mains. The lamb and pork where fall off the fork tender and a highlight of the meal. All dishes were colourful and well presented---at almost picturesque level---perhaps the kitchen staff knew I take photos of my food! All in, if you're looking slightly off the beaten path high-end yet casual meal, Lima should be on your short list.",

Probably. \u00a0Food is superb in terms of taste and presentation, but unlike most other Michelin star restaurants it has a nice relaxed atmosphere whereby the food is the real star. \u00a0I might not have understood everything on the menu but it wasn't because Lima was pretentious. \u00a0It's probably the most relaxed Michelin star environment I have been in and that's not to say that the decor or service is bad (although it is a little tight in terms of space). \u00a0And perhaps this lack of stuffiness allows anyone and everyone to really enjoy the food, this can b put down to not o my the ambience of the space but the friendly nature of the waiters too.Like tapas or dim sum, you have the best experience at Lima by going with more people as all the dishes are great for sharing. \u00a0We went as a party of four which allowed us to explore the menu but there were still dishes I wanted to try but didn't. \u00a0Presentation of all dishes were beautiful and not a single one of the 10 starters/mains/sides disappointed. \u00a0The octopus, scallops, duck and halibut where the stand out dishes for us. \u00a0All the dishes had a great balance of flavour often mixing subtle tones of sweet, sour, spice and savoury. \u00a0Plus a few flavours that aren't common in western European cuisine. \u00a0The warm bread is amazing too.Lima ticks one of the best boxes for me in terms of food: interesting and tasty plates of food that are not overly trying to be.",

    "text": "Lima is the upscale, Michelin starred version of the other big Peruvian name in town, Ceviche / Andina of the Martin Morales family. It apparently is a foreign outpost of the famed Virgilio Martinez, head chef at the world renowned Central restaurant located in Lima, Peru, who makes all the executive decisions on the London menu. We came on a weekday evening and had a table for 2 in their upstairs dining room, which benefits from a high ceiling that is entirely skylight. The staff were very friendly and guided us around both the menu and the wine list. They advised getting 3 starters and 2 mains for 2 people, which was the perfect amount of food. We got both of the Lima signature dishes, octopus olivo and lomo steak, as well as the sea bream ceviche. I was very impressed by the octopus, which was beautifully plated with delicious bites of octopus sitting atop yellow quinoa, and decorated with drops of an olive sauce on the other side of the plate. The lomo steak was good, but not as noteworthy. I wasn't a fan of the powdery yellow aji sauce, and I would have preferred juicy cubes of steak instead of the thinly sliced, rather dry presentation that gave it the consistency of roast beef. The sea bream, however, was delicious and swimming in a very tasty tiger's milk broth, and the crunchy corn in it was a perfect complement. For mains, I got the recommended Amazonian fish, having decided that it might have been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to try such a fish, and my friend got the pork cheek special. I didn't try the pork cheeks, but my fish was a meaty, white fish that came as fillets in a rich buttery sauce. As with all these dishes, I can't tell you exactly what the ingredients were (the descriptions on the menu are not very comprehensible to the occasional diner of Peruvian cuisine), but it was delicious. All in all, I very much enjoyed my experience at Lima and would keep it in mind for another special occasion.",

    "text": "In light of a trip to Peru later this year, I thought I'd prepare myself a bit culinary. The only reason to put the bread and dip on the table is the colour (purple and orange), there is no flavour in it at all!Luckily you can rinse your dry throat with an excellent pisco sour! Maybe it's a strategic move... The octopus with purple olive sauce (I guess purple was on sale)... It's a small dish but I savoured every bite!Next the scallop ceviche with tigermilk... Although too much of the of the tiger milk overwhelms the flavours of the delicate scallop, the right proportion of both blows you away! There must be a peru on different planetexporting traditional sea bream ceviche. An excellent mixture of savoury crisp onion, sweetish corn, fresh seabream and zesty lime, this dish is simply divine!Even though the restaurant was packed, the waitress really took care of me, to that extent that she talked me in ordering one of the specials: Amazonian paiche soup... Either the peruvian cuisine allows playing with sour and crispy and savoury, or this chef is a mastermind...If peruvian cuisine is like this everywhere in Peru, I'm doomed to gain several kilo's!!",

They took a couple of typical Peruvian ingredients and made up dishes.The things mentioned above aren't the main reason why I'm giving this rating to this restaurant. I signed up on Yelp exclusively to be able to share one of the waiters was completely disrespectful to me.

    "text": "I found Lima on Yelp, as I find lots of places these days. I was looking at the categories and I thought, \"Ha! Peruvian in London?\" But then I found Lima.I believe Lima's relatively new though they're not hurting for business. I arrived to a reasonably empty room that filled up completely in about 45 minutes.What they serve is pretty exotic and I can see how their average customer would need to ask what a few things are. I think they'd find it useful to put a bit more explanation into their menus. I observed that the wait staff spent lots of time describing the dishes on the menu, as the explanations you get from the menu of each dish consist of ingredients (a few of which I'd never heard of) and not much else. More on this later.They have yummy cocktails and we felt spoilt for choice. My starter was so good the person across the table from me started laughing because I got that look on my face, you know, the one you have when it's like angels are singing because of that first blissful bite?The mains continued the trend. I've never had what they served me cooked that well and there was a lovely punch of red pepper sauce that rounded this out perfectly. I had removed every molecule of food from my plate when they arrived to clear it and marveled over how fab my meal was so far.So, why not five stars?Dessert, and the way they handled turning our table, left us feeling that we'd return -maybe at some point--instead of the next humanly possible moment. So, here's the story:Remember when I mentioned that the wait staff spend lots of time explaining the menu? Our waiter patiently did this (for about 20 minutes straight) for the rather large table next to us. We didn't mind this too much at the time though it did mean that we waited a long time to order - about 40 minutes after we arrived.So, when the hostess delivered our desserts (the drinks we ordered were nowhere in sight) and cheerfully informed us we had to vacate the table in 5 minutes, we were not pleased. When I tasted my dessert and discovered it was basically a very small amount of quinoa floating in a small amount of yogurt with 3 very small bits of chocolate I was even less pleased. And when we had to prompt our waiter to bring our drinks when he cleared our dessert plates we were losing our senses of humour. When he delivered them and cheerfully confirmed we had five minutes to drink them and pay our check, we were pissed off.I'd say this place has lots of promise and I understand having more than one seating in a night - I can't imagine the ingredients they work with are cheap (though the portions certainly aren't large) and on the face of it, 2 hours sounds like enough time...If things get started reasonably quickly. If this doesn't happen, the result's unhappy customers.So, I'll return. Maybe. At some point. It'll probably be a while.",

    "text": "Lima was recommended to me by two friends. I heard that since it got a Michelin Star, it has been quite hard to get a booking. I tried several times and finally got one on a week night. I was quite excited to try it and I have to say I was impressed. The restaurant itself is quite relaxed and understated which I really like. The services are warm and personal. I guess the South American attitude prevails here. The restaurant serves updated Peruvian food. Don't expect to find Lomo Saltado or Anticucho. However, Ceviche you can feast on and it is done right here. My friend and I ordered sea bream ceviche which was perfectly \"cooked\" in lime juice: fresh, firm and flavorful. We also had the octopus and quinoa with purple olive sauce. The plating of this dish was beautiful and the purple olive was a taste I experienced for the first time. We got the raw tuna with purple potatoes as well. It was delicious and purple potatoes were something you don't get to eat everyday. For main course, we shared a suckling pig and Amazon fish. The pork dish was nice, but the Amazon fish was totally amazing! According to our waiter, the fish was native to the Amazon and was freshly shipped in. The preparation of the dish was also quite unusual. The fish was cooked in Seaweed butter which gave it a slight sweet taste. And besides other seasonings, the surprising element was cocoa. I guess this has the similar effect as the Mole sauce, but I have only seen Mole sauce used with heavier meat like beef. Cooking delicate fish in cocoa takes guts. I guess that is why the restaurant has that Michelin star, they experiment and push the boundary. The fish dish definitely the highlight of the meal and I couldn't have enough of it. We were full by the time we fished our main course, so we will have to come back to try the desserts another time.",

    "text": "With only three days in London and lots of lovely friends to catch up with we had to really think carefully about where we wanted to eat. Plenty of exciting restaurant openings to consider - and I guess our main goal was to sample cuisines that are yet to launch on Melbourne's scene (or have been attempted but to no avail - for example - Japanese ramen - see post here).With this in mind, we opted to meet a couple of our leading ladies at Lima, stopping off at nearby Bourne and Hollingsworth first for a few cheeky cocktails in their charming retro living room.The peeling floral wallpaper, teacups and chintzy tableclothes have a kind of 1940s wartime austerity about them. Might explain why the drinks are half the price they are in Melbourne.Feeling well-oiled and ready to dig into some South American share plates we trot down Rathbone Place to Lima, which is empty. That's what you get when you manage to secure a booking two days before the evening you want to dine at one of the most talked about places of the year - a table downstairs at 5:30pm. Luckily, the place feels warm and inviting, and we soon forget we are the sole customers for at least the first half hour. Or that might have been the Pisco Sours tricking us into a false sense of security.None of us have ever partaken in Peruvian food outside of Peru (which apparently when you are on a backpacker's budget isn't that great - WordMonkey takes great delight in telling me about the potato, carrot and onion soup she once ordered, that consisted of a whole potato, a whole carrot and a whole onion floating in a bowl of hot water) so we aren't sure what to expect. We know about the much-hyped superfood quinoa - and have even learnt how to pronounce it properly - but that is about it. Luckily, chef Virgilio Martinez hails from fine stock - the now multi-location acclaimed Astrid y Gaston and most recently Central in Lima, Peru.There are nods to the restaurant's South American heritage - cushions covered in Peruvian print with colourful Inca prints and a wall downstairs dedicated to indigenous artists, but on the whole the place is light and airy, and understated.Which perhaps means the insanely colourful food comes as even more of a surprise. The nine starters and eight mains (four from the sea and four from the land) are described in a minimalist fashion - usually the main protein and the style in which it is prepared. Underneath, a list of the main components are listed. Not much else.So when the bright yellow Artichoke Amazonia landed on our table (artichokes, fava beans, white onion, tree tomato and molle pink pepper) we were pleasantly dazzled. Light with a slight citrus zing it was one of the best veggie dishes I have had in a while.But it couldn't compete with the Duck Crudo (Magret duck, algarrobo tree syrup, foie gras, green leaves). Satisfyingly rich and fatty without being greasy the duck was cooked perfectly and for 10 quid was a great size serve.The other two starters we ordered, in my mind, didn't quite hit the mark. Perhaps they were trying too hard to include a myriad ingredients sourced from the Andes to the Amazon, or perhaps it was just me struggling to get to grips with so many new flavours, textures and unfamiliar components \u00a0on one plate.Tuna Causa (yellow fin tuna, blue potato, ghoa cress, ginger confit) was plated up to look at pretty as a picture with pansies or nasturtiums perched on top of the tempura-ish fish. But the slightly startling blue (more purple than blue) potato just didn't look appetising and was grainy and starchy.The presentation of Octopus Olivo had clearly been thought about a lot, and the dots of pink something were reminiscent of the creature's tentacles, but again, the ingredients (braised octopus, organic white quinoa, botija olive, red shiso) didn't combine to create anything special.On to the mains - Suckling Pig 'Andes' (giant corn, ghoa cress, piquillo pepper, green rocoto) - well-seasoned and succulent meat, just the right balance of flesh, fat and crackle.Lastly, Olluco Tuber '4000 metros' (queso fresco, red quinoa, asparagus Peru, yellow aji pepper). Very earthy, lots of root vegetable action happening here.We didn't stick around for dessert - we could have done - as we weren't stuffed. But then we hadn't gone overboard in the ordering and all the plates were very light.Instead, we checked out Bourne and Hollingsworth's new sister establishment, Reverend J. W. Simpson. More shabby chic but in a larger space. More great cocktails but in smarter glasses (as opposed to jam jars). We like.",

While the meat was tender, it was the bed of mash potatoes that really blew me away. The waiter told me that the potatoes are dried which gives them a texture that felt like an extremely-fine polenta rather than mashed potatoes. I would stay away from the vegetarian rice if I went again, while I appreciated the mushrooms, the taste of the sauce was overwhelming -- too tart and also too salty.Anyways - I'm glad I got the chance to come and try this out before heading out of London!",

    "text": "After experiencing Central in Lima Peru, we found out that master chef Virgilio Martinez also opened a similar restaurant in London, so we decided to give it a chance. After a long taxi ride trying to find the restaurant we finally reached it and were surprised how small the establishment is compared to flagship location in Peru. Due to the cold weather, the exterior did feel very cozy and welcoming, while not overly modern, but with some Inca designs as well. First off the waitress brought us a special corn bread made from real Peruvian corn and a sample of spiced carrot soup. Both items were complimentary and were very good especially when dunking the bread into the warm soup. Next up we decided to order several dishes, so we can sample a little bit of everything, so we choose the Cobin Fish Tiradito, asparagus causa, king crab causa, braised octopus, and the prawn bisque. The first dish to arrive was the king crab causa, which used a red potato mashed and rolled up to balls with a rich king crab salad on top, it was really flavorsome and you can taste the chunks of crab within the topping. Then came the asparagus causa which mixed the yellow mashed potato with asparagus giving it a greenish color, and yellow pepper sauce gave it a good kick. The Cobin Fish tiradito was super fresh and the fish was perfectly cut and had the right amount of lemon, and mult-colored sauces did not overpower the plate. The braised octopus were very tender and perfectly season however I would of removed the lentil that were placed under it since I am not a big fan. The last dish was a prawn bisque soup for the each of us, it included multiple large prawns, rice, fresh cheese, and the season broth. When it came time for dessert we couldn't agree so we ordered two, the avocado mousse and the Chirimoya Parfait. The avocado mousse was a thick cream made with the actual avocado and a dark chocolate mousse in the middle placed in avocado shell in cased in dark chocolate. It had the right combination of sweet and a little bit of savory which is weird for a dessert. The chirimoya parfait is the a cream made from a Peruvian custard fruit, with a scoop of ice cream made from Amazonian chocolate. The dish was very refreshing but I would of prefer it to be a little bit sweeter rather then tarty. Overall a very good choice for a special dinner, and just like Central in Peru, the food and the experience will be remembered for years to come.",

I love Peruvian food, pisco sours make me merry (in every sense of the word) and it had been awarded that special star, so I came in with pretty high expectations.Here's the excellent: The standout winner of the night for me, was the pisco sour. All the ingredients are \u00a0homemade and fresh in this restaurant and, on that front, the cocktail was deliciously outstanding.Something else that deserves a shoutout is the bread (which we weren't expecting). It was spongy, a bit salty (but not overbearingly so) and unexpectedly a little spicy. So delicious!The service was spot on too and I can't fault our lovely waiter.The fine-nothing-to-write-home-about:Unfortunately, the food. I ordered a ceviche, which I've had on multiple occasions and a chicken pachamanca, was nice, but not out-of-this-world, Michelin-star worthy in my opinion.I thought the presentation was lacklustre and lacked creativity. And whilst the flavours were there and it was tasty, I also felt it fell a little short. I'm not sure if less effort was made on the food front because we were dining on a deal as opposed to paying the full price, but if that is the case, I don't think they should promote it as Michelin unless they intended on truly embracing that title for their bargain-loving customers.If you want more succulent Peruvian dishes with nicer surroundings - but I should add not for a bargain price, two courses and a drink would cost around \u00a340 - go to Casita Andina!",

The menu really excites me. After visiting twice, I have been impressed with the presentation, bold flavours and colours in each dish. In fact, each dish looks like a piece of art. Great pisco sours and good service. \u00a0 Octopus Olivo, braised octopus, purple corn, botija olive is delicious and the purple colour is so vibrant. The olive adds a nice acidity to the dish. The sea bass ceviche with avocado, yellow tiger's milk and cancha corn was a refreshing start to the meal - as you would expect a ceviche to be. Although at \u00a312 this is quite expensive, when I compare to the ceviche I've enjoyed at Andina/Ceviche/Senor Ceviche etc. The Artichoke Amazonia was one pretty dish, but unfortunately I found it very vinegary and could not finish the whole dish. My dinner dates ordered the Beef Pachamama with yellow potato puree, cows milk, aji panca juice and absolutely loved it. The beef was cooked perfectly.Equally as delicious was the Duck Cocona wth magret, plums, cocona syrup and cusco corn cake. This is a place that emphasizes presentation and sophisticated dishes. A little on the expensive side, but you can tell there is a lot of work behind each dish. I like it!",

Then we ordered the halibut and the beef pachamanca again the combination of flavors and the fresh ingredients were just incredible and we finished it all with the guava ice cream. The only criticism I have will be the space itself, it's rather small and feels just a tad claustrophobic but the food is excellent so you get over the lack of intimacy very quickly.",

    "text": "So this is a bit of a weird review - I've now been to Lima twice. And had different experiences. The first time was a client a la carte lunch. Well that was amazing, the food was delicious, fantastic combinations of flavours. The ceviches are of course absolutely amazing, but the menu itself is just full of excitement. Desserts are not bad either. Of course, must bear in mind it's not cheap... But I do not think it's crazy priced either, especially for a Michelin stared restaurant. The second time, I went for the bottomless brunch for my birthday. Bottomless booze is always a winner, nothing else to add to that!! However, the menu itself really wasn't breathtaking. The ceviche was great but the rest of the menu really wasn't special. I'd even go as far as saying the chicken wasn't even good. I appreciate you must also keep in mind the price, which was cheap! But still I really wasn't convinced this was michelin starred quality, I wouldn't say it was good either. I definitely wouldn't recommend the brunch and I definitely wouldn't go back for the brunch. Nonetheless I definitely want to go back and have the a la carte menu. One more little anecdote - my friends have the Lima cookbook. They fell in love with Peruvian food during the Peruvian holiday. They invited us for dinner and cooked for us, three course meal & even made a few pisco sours! it was delicious! Conclusion, the cookbook is pretty rgeat too! :) Here's my literary review of the day!",

And I just heard it is the first Peruvian restaurant awarded with a Michelin star in the world!I came here because I was craving for good ceviche. No hesitation after I was seated, I immediately chose to order the sea bream ceviche, then the salmon one.Well presented, the seafood is marinated and it has the bitterness like it should be!Fish is fresh and served in great portion.Then, I decided to try their meat. No disappointment with the sweet potato mash topped with minced lamb. I just wish to go back soon!I was wondering how the dessert would be. And.. again it is pleasant to eat the chef dishes. I got the white biscuit with dulce de leche in the middle.The restaurant is bright and is quite busy at lunch time, book your table!Service is really nice.Price is competitive for the lunch. Amazing experience!",

    "text": "Ooh a difficult review to write. I usually write a review based partly on expectation - it wouldn't be fair to hold a mom and pop hole in the wall restaurant to the same standards as a Michelin star restaurantMy dilemma is that Lima has been heavily trailed as being the first Peruvian restaurant in the world to be awarded a Michelin star, which will appear in the 2014 guide. Based on this, my sister kindly took me here for dinner on my birthday last weekI'm not that familiar with Peruvian food, assuming it to be similar to Mexican and south American cuisine. Hence the fact that there were quite a few ingredients on the menu, which weren't familiar to us, such as chia seed, Algarrobo tree syrup and aji panca. Unfortunately, our waiter struggled to convey much about these mystery ingredients, so we just ordered what looked interesting on the menuWe started with duck crudo and scallop tiradito. I must say that the plating of the scallop was exceptional with the delicate this rounds of white scallop meat being paired with vibrant bright orange oil, which looked like the scallop coral. The sweet scallop meat was paired with zingy flavours from the rest of the dish.My favourite dish of the evening was the duck crudo - soft, hardly cooked duck with sweet and savoury elements from the sauce and accompaniments that made it a perfect mouthful. Don't be put off by the appearance of the dish which looks like a Jackson Pollock painting when it arrives My sister and I both love suckling pig and we got a few slices of pork with a green and nutty sauce. Perhaps the skin could have been a bit crisper but this was a competent dish, both in concept and executionWe shared a couple of desserts with unfamiliar names and ingredients but both tasted like ice cream with bits. Nothing memorable to report.Now, if this was a regular meal, I would have said it was a good meal but as much as I hate to be a party-pooper, it isn't Michelin star standard. I understand that Michelin do maybe have to have an eye-catching headline to sell their books but without wanting to put Lima down, which is a nice restaurant, I think Michelin have lost their minds and their palate when Lima gets a Michelin star and Kitchen Table, which has served me 2 of my favourite meals this year, doesn't get one. I'm just asking for consistencyI hope that Lima won't be burdened by their Michelin star tag and suffer like Petersham Nurseries a few years ago, which was unexpectedly awarded a star and was unable to meet the expectation of eager foodies, who turned up and were disappointed, leading to the eventual departure of their star chef Skye GyngellHaving said all that, Lima gets 4 stars and I can recommend their starters",
