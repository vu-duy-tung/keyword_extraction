    "text": "There are three things on the menu: lobster, lobster roll, and the burger. They don't even bother handing you a menu. Each is 20 pounds. Service is good. We first went to the other Burger & Lobster location, where the wait was over an hour. Tthe host was kind enough to call the Soho location and inquire if they had space. Lucky for us, they did, and there was no wait. It was a bit troublesome to trek across the city, but considering how hungry we were, it was worth it. Service continued to be good, with our waiter being a nice guy, funny, and prompt. He did mix up one of our orders though, but I won't dock points since he said he was new. I ordered the grilled lobster. Others at my table got steamed lobster, but safe to say, no one thought about getting the burger. The lobster was a healthy 1.5 pounds with lots of roe and tomale. Each also came with a tasty salad (arugula, cheese, and balsamic) and chips/fries. I don't think any of us finished the chips! It was just a ton of food. Very very tasty food. I admit I was skeptical of the price tag and value of the meal, but everything was so tasty and the place so comfortable, that we were more than happy to leave a good tip at the end!",

The lobster seriously gets you full, but they also include fries and a salad! They also serve a big burger as their 2nd option and a lobster roll as a 3rd option for those of you who don't like to crack the lobster! Definitely saving my money to come here again! Make sure to bring your friends! It's a must go to place if you're costing London!",

There are only three things on the menu: a burger, a lobster roll, and a whole lobster. My friend recommended that we get only the lobster roll and lobster, which is what we did exactly. We asked for the garlic butter with the whole lobster along with the lobster roll. Everything tasted divine, and the cost was only 20 pounds per dish, definitely worth the price! I would recommend this place and definitely am planning to come back again with other friends who have not yet tried this local favorite yet!",

    "text": "Absolutely love this place. There can be long queues, especially at popular dinner and lunch times, but totally worth it. I've tried both the burger and lobster roll, and have never been disappointed. The lobster roll is packed with lobster meat and served on a delicious buttered brioche roll (yes, that bun alone might be a heart attack, but lipsmacking good i say!). The burger almost seems expensive at 20 pounds compared to the lobster and lobster roll, which are all offered at the same price, but definitely one of the great burgers of London.This restaurant has been expanding around London, but I've only been to the Mayfair and Soho locations which are very different in terms of ambience (same amazing level of food). The Mayfair location is smaller and feels more intimate while the Soho location has more tables and feels more modern. These locations have different perks but you really can't go wrong when burger or lobster is involved!",

They were apologetic, and admitted 2 things:- That they were at fault that day at the Soho branch- HQ was also at fault for not getting back to me and it wasn't intentional, and that it fell through the cracks somehow in their communicationThey said it was a sign that they need some training on their side and invited me back to show that they can provide quality food (something I didn't doubt) with great customer service. This was the type of response I was hoping for, though it sucked that it took this long for someone to get back to me. \u00a0Maybe I'll finally get to post a proper review on their food + service! \u00a0There are tons of positive reviews on their food, so at this point, I'm not doubting the food quality... they just need to work on their customer service.",

    "text": "Don't be mistaken here, it's Burger OR Lobster. But what you really should go for is the Lobster Roll (third and final option on the menu)! Who goes for the burger here anyway, when you have another 1000 places in London that do proper burgers?The roll comes as a toasted garlic-butter sandwich, stuffed with pieces of lobster meat. Along come a little salad, a portion of fries and extra sauce. \u00a0It's the combo of the fresh lobster, the toasted-to-perfection bread and that sauce that really makes this a dish worth paying \u00a320 for. I had a whisky-based cocktail (can't remember the name and can't find the menu on their website) which was about \u00a39 and really good as well.Make sure to go there first, put your name down (they call you when your table is ready) and go for a drink somewhere else until it's your turn. Prepare yourself however for more of a fast food service. You get seated, pick your drink, pick your food (there's no food menu) and 5 min later you get served. It's not really a place to hangout or have a relaxing dinner which is a bit of a shame for a \u00a320 meal.",

If you're on your own, you can sit at the bar and don't have to wait at all.On another note - their simple and straightforward menu hits the spot. I don't like spending forever deciding which derivative of the same food I'd want to have. So the choice is lobster, burger and lobster roll each for \u00a320. I would rate them: lobster - #1, lobster roll - #2 and burger - #3. Basically I've had better burgers. I love simple clarified butter which doesn't overpower the flavour of the lobster meat. And oh my...their berry cheesecake mousse is a cloud of happiness (don't be surprised that it's served in a porridge takeaway pot! - it's cool, alright?).I went there with my friends for breakfasts, lunches, dinners. I went there on my own - it's just so very comfortable in there for whatever reason! And I also love the bar seats in this branch, I often ask for the seat there even if I'm not on my own :)The service is quick too.",

My advice - prop yourself up at the bar and have a drink - the cocktails are seriously good!Once you've made the arduous decision as to whether you're going to go surf or turf, sit back and get ready for the beautiful beast to make it's way to your table. I always go whole lobster, grilled with lemon butter, however I have it on good authority that the burger is amazing too though....and i really do intend to try it every time I go, but \u00a320 for a whole lobster? There's no arguing with that.There's now serveral B&L locations across London including the 5th Floor at Harvey Nics.",

I am not a great fan of seafood so I went for the burger. It was excellent but the \u00a320 price tag was a bit high in my opinion. The lobster on the other hand was apparently amazing!The atmosphere and decor of the place is nice and even it's big and busy it was not too loud. They have a nice selection of beers and wine which for London standards are even decently priced.It's a super trendy at the moment so get there early or prepare to queue.

Happy times.The restaurant was absolutely buzzing with large groups of people and the interior had an old rustic American dinner appeal to it with a cocktail bar.I absolutely loved the fact that there was no menu and only 3 options were available. We decided to order a grilled lobster over the choice of stemmed lobster or a burger.Finally when the lobster made it to our table, it looked regal sitting on the silver platter, and at first glance we just knew it was going to be succulent and bursting with flavours. The whole meal looked bountiful with complementary skinny fries, garlic butter dips, and a crunchy salad covered in sprinkles of goat cheese.Read more here and help us growfacebook.com/pages/Food-\u2026",

Burger, lobster and lobster (roll)...are your choices.If you're big on variety, this may leave you listless. I went for the lobster, as did Good Friend. The best choice in terms of a value to money spend. (Plus, to go for anything else would be obscene. In clear violation of Yee Gan O.'s wise, guiding Thrift Gene). Casual glance around the place, it was packed to the max. Like the Beastie Boys' Intergalact, sardines in a can, stacked!We waited at the bar, had to fight for a seat. Eyes rolling, heads lolling, Passive aggressive looks flowin', elbows throwin', Whatever a girl's gotta do for some meat! Well, if the logistics and ambiance are boring you, dude. Then, onwards! Onwards, and on to the food. Sigh of relief, finally seated. Our wait of an hour, completed. Service was spotless, waiter knowledgeable and nice. When asked questions, so silly 'tude or Larry David Krazee Eyez. Brought cutlery, more drinks and two bibs. You know, the kind you get when you eat ribs. Out came the plates and they were large. Not sure if I can finish this, better put Charles in Charge? Salad, a pot of chips/fries, a huge lobster, butter sauce.With the obligatory cutlery, then left to your own devices, you're the boss. Lob offered grilled or steamed, I went for the former with no regrets. \u00a0It was perfect, I dined with no upsets. Easily slid out of it's shell. Dipped it in butter, the salad and chips were good as well. The lobster roll looked huge, filled to the brim,With mayo-ey goodness, enclosed by a lovely brioche bun, prim. Looked far and wide for a glimpse of the burger, tender, brown ground.Like looking for lobster at In N' Out, nowhere to be found. And for 20 quid, I see why. Is the beef Kobe quality, if the price is so sky high? Not sure, because I did not try it. But perhaps someone would say that their money was well spent. Was surprised at the grand size of the venue,Large beer and wine list, more extensive than the menu. But overall, that was okay. 'Cause it's not like you go for the drinks anyway. Enjoyed Burger & Lobster, have to say. And I definitely would go out of my way. To return to this place, although it's pricey.The bathrooms were chic and clean, mirrors pristine, service wasn't too dicey. But if you're a vegetarian, Fair Yelper. A visit is as useless as an empty fridge and a box of Hamburger Helper.",

Wait was long but we stuck with it as that's were we had decided to goEventually got inside, then eventually got seated. By this point wasn't really that hungry Ordered cocktails which were nice and then food. 2 friends I went with ordered the lobster and I went with the lobster rollThey both said it was ok, nothing wrong with it but weren't bowled over especially as lobster is there thingMy brioche bun was gooood and warm but the lobster inside was cold as it was a premixed chopped up lobster. I didn't really like that it was cold and I asked them to heat it up knowing that it could change the quality but they flat out refused in a rather rude way! There wasn't much else to the meal and I ended up paying \u00a330 for a drink and a sandwich so wasn't very impressed by the cost eitherI wouldn't come back again - the food wasn't awful I just don't think it is worth it",

I knew what to expect as I had been to the one near Green Park before. Having said that, I felt that the quality was slightly less than how I remembered it. It was still solid good. Everything was spot on, and I loved all the lobster packed in the tasty brioche roll as I always have!A pleasant surprise were the cocktails. I ordered the Oblisque (name?), and I absolutely loved it.Service was amazing as well. Prompt and also very kind. Finally, the venue was a lot more spacious and stylish than the one near Green Park. Definitely worth a try if you haven't tried it yet!",

    "text": "Before coming to London this restaurant had been put on our list as \" must visits \" due to great reviews from various sites ,and when we finally did get there it proved well worthy of such . The first night we were in London we thought we will go then , so we wandered along until getting to it we were told sorry full up and closing not so far away anyway. So we decided \u00a0 to go elsewhere and come back at an earlier time the next day. \u00a0So coming back earlier proved worthwhile....though around lunchtime it was packed out and we had to wait a little while to get a table . But that's okay. And we grabbed a drink from the bar while waiting. Finally seated our choices were easily made. The Lobster Roll for myself and the Whole Lobster for my better half. \u00a0The service was good, with a smile and the orders came out pretty quickly despite the place being packed out. And about the food....Though i have not eating lobster that much the lobster roll was top notch and would i reckon satisfy even those who detest lobster. \u00a0As for the whole lobster...well the same could be said from the comments i got. All the mains by the way are served with fries and salad. To sum it all up excellent service, food, and though a little noisy due to being a busy restaurant the ambience / atmosphere inside is still good. Nice place to chow down on some beautiful lobster and smack bang in the centre of London too!! Highly recommend!!Just expect a little bit of a wait especially at night. Enjoy!!!",

    "text": "My friend in London is always talking about Burger and Lobster, so when I was visiting last weekend I jumped at the chance to go. There are 6 B&L restaurants to choose from in London - we happened to stumble across the Soho branch and I am very glad I did. Arriving there at 5pm, there was a small queue of people waiting for tables - and after being told there would be a 30 - 40 minute wait for a table I decided that I would wait it out. 30 mins later we were shown to our table and a waitress approached. There is no physical menu put in front of you, but the waitress explains how it works. The concept is brilliant - you pay \u00a320 and for that you get either a Burger or a Lobster. Simple. - The burgers are a 10oz beef burger served either plain from the grill or with bacon and / or cheese. - The lobster is a 1.5lb whole lobster served either steamed or steamed and finished off on the grill with lemon and garlic butter. - They also do a lobster roll - cold lobster meat dressed in a Japanese mayo serviced in a warm toasted brioche bun. All dishes are served with French fries and a side salad. After looking around the restaurant it was clear which was the most popular choice. We both opted for Lobster, to which the waitress said 'excellent choice' - she was right. The dish was fantastic - the lobster was perfectly cooked, halved, in the shell and the fries were fab, especially dipped in the garlic butter sauce provided for the lobster. I fastened my bib, yes BIB, and got cracking on those lobster claws. They have other lobster options available or 'Jumbo' options on a blackboard ranging up to 90lb lobster for \u00a3172!!The restaurant is pretty big but the tables are close together - which makes the experience all the more fun when you look around and everyone else is wearing a bib too! You can't help but laugh. When we left (around 6.45pm) the queue was out of the door AND down the street. The wait was over an hour and half but the people waiting didn't seem to mind. They must have been before and know how good it is. This restaurant in Soho only takes reservations for groups between 6 - 10 people - so for everyone else you just have to wait. The fact I had to wait 30 minutes is the only reason i haven't given B&L 5 stars.. but it was London on a Sunday evening so i can't be too critical. I'll definitely be going to B&L again - and with rumors of a Manchester branch opening on King St soon it will be going to the top of my favourites list!",

    "text": "If you live in London you're bound to have heard of Burger & Lobster, if you haven't, the biggest hint you'll get is the name and the best surprise is yet to come..Can I start by talking about the butter? Because quite honestly if there was ever anything I'd justify dipping into pure melted butter, it's got to be lobster... It just demands it.Lemon and herb clarified butter smothering each meaty yet delicate morsel, yes indulgence is the key at Burger & Lobster and if you can't hack that then just don't bother.My friend, Lauren and I headed there for our girls' night, which it so happened turned into somewhat of a celebration, as she has been announced as first author on a medical journal! So my published friend and I headed for the Dean Street branch of this little, well-known place.The occasion demanded that we enjoy champagne with such glutinous glory - that, as I understand it, is very much the purpose of eating lobster. And of course such outlandishly expensive meat insists the side orders allow you to double said indulgence, no skimping here... So we complied with a *chink* of our glasses and a \"Chin! Chin!\"The thing is, that surprise we're waiting on, is that this particular lobster, of quite substantial size set me back a whole, ooh, \u00a320. \u00a0Not hardly the bank breaking endeavour one expected from the evening of lavish crustacean, smothered in glorious buttery bliss. Let's not forget, with a side of proper potato fries (I stress proper.. not frozen to fried rubbish) and a respectable side salad, dressed with balsamic reduction and parmesan shavings to ensure its adequacy amongst the plate of 'pucka'... So you see, of course we went for the champagne to sip it all down.As I found myself in a suitably sociable surrounding whilst eating Lobster, (there was no one offering to pull my chair out and the restaurant is very much of an American diner vibe, buzzy and loud) I couldn't help but breach etiquette and offer Lauren a round of 'a-claws' for her achievements.....and then we proceeded to fling our lobster out towards each other, because if there's one thing we're definitely not, it's shellfish.So what do you need to know on your first visit?You need to know that the question is not, 'to bun or not to bun?' The question is a simple one for a first timer, 'steamed or grilled?'Oh yes, the first time - I wanted the shell, the bib, the picky fork thing and the passionate pinch of the lobster as I tried to manoeuvre the meat from inside its shell... Wish (challenge) granted! And an option I'd highly recommend, the following steps will provide an optimum dining experience...Choose the whole lobster (pay more for a larger one if you fancy) - steamed or grilled, treat it kindly and give it a butter bath and champagne slide all the way to bed(that's your belly).We both had the steamed whole lobster and it was moist and delicious!Now what's also important as an experienced first timer is that I wouldn't advise you bring a date here until a well-trained cracking and pulling technique has been ascertained, because personally, \u00a0I chose to eat every last bit of it, that pretty pink crustacean. Oh no! It did not defeat me, but the wrestle to the finish line may not have made the most attractive date. Lauren could probably vouch for me... .. I could definitely vouch for her!C.x",

As an American that grew up only eating fresh seafood, this just REALLY doesn't cut it. Frozen lobster completely lacking in flavour? No thanks....I would pay twice the price for the same meal made with fresh lobster. This is not what lobster is meant to taste like...not to mention I had a stomachache afterwards...And the burger is nothing special - so not worth \u00a320. But 2 stars because the fries are good - the best thing in this place actually. Just get a big plate of fries, a small mediocre salad and a glass of red wine if you have the unfortunate luck of ending up here for lunch or dinner. But do not, I repeat, do not get the lobster.",

    "text": "I was visiting from the US and received a recommendation to check this place out from one of my Brit friends. On a Thursday night around 8 pm, the wait was about 30 minutes. Not bad if say. I enjoyed how they encouraged us to drink while waiting by sending over a server to bring drinks. I must say that the drinks were my favorite part of my visit. If you are a fan of Hendricks gin, try the Camomile Fizz. Delish!As we entered the dining area, it became very LOUD! When we were sat, I was a bit underwhelmed. Instead of a traditional menu, the server explained their 3-4 options. Given how loud it was, this would have been fine for one with a keen ear to the British accent however my American trained ear was a bit slow to pick up what the options were. Ultimately, you have a choice between a (1) small steamed lobster, (2) a lobster roll or (3) a hamburger. Each option comes with fries and a small side salad that is covered in balsamic dressing and parmesan cheese. Each option is also the same price of 20 pounds. Apparently our server had an untrained ear to American accents because our order came out wrong. We ordered two lobster rolls and ended up with one lobster roll and one steamed lobster. The food was good; the drinks were better. I'd definitely return for the cocktails but I'd likely eat elsewhere as the lobster was not dressed to impress.",

Now I have been there for more than 5 times and I can say that this is not right at all!! Almost everytime we got friendly and helpful services. Never got rush out!Knowing that they are always busy and long queue therefore the first time we went there at 12 sharp which when they open their door and was lucky that we didn't waited long. we were the 4th table be seated inside. With a baby and buggy you really didn't want to spend too long in the queue and didn't get a good table. There was once, we went there around 2 yish queue was really long. The bar was full of people. The lady told us the wait will be 45 mins and she took our number. We went to some where in soho to have a drink and we got a call in 20 mins to tell us that there is a table for us! And a good tips here is, if you really don't bother sitting nicely at a table and really crave for a lobster.....go straight to the bar. You can have lobster at the bar too. Do not need to wait for a table!!! We really enjoyed watching the bartender making the cocktail and eating our meal there.Food wise I don't think I need to comment more on this!!! Yummy yummy! Can't have enough of it!!! Service wise, very good! Staff are helpful and friendly. They will come check on you with a patient smile not like check for the seek of checking kind like nandos! Lol One more tips, if you do not know how to remove the one whole piece of claw meat out of the claw, please ask any of the staff!! Because there was once I was trying to crash the claw to get the meat and happen that a lady staff walk pass and she stop me and show me the proper way of removing the meat out which is super easy n fast!! So please ask them to show you!!",

To be honest most evenings are busy, at least in the Soho branch.The cocktails, if you are waiting inside, are not the very adventurous, but like most restaurants with cocktails they will be able to make a classic if you request, nicely !I have heard the burgers are good, but I am sure there are other eateries specialising in burgers given the hype over super calorific food in London. I was here for the lobster, and have had consistency in both quality and portions when I have had my B&L lobster! You will be given a bib, give the green light for you and your fellow guests getting as messy and as hands on as you want.The garlic and butter sauce is not the best garlic and butter sauce I have had. but I have seen others pouring the lot over the lobster, which I guess is another experience entirely !Hoping to have more cocktail options on the next visit as the wait can be horrendous.. Having said that, you can put down your name and visit one of the many bars in Soho while you wait for your juicy, succelent lobster!",

The lobster if you take the \u00a325 option is so small that you can hardly taste it therefore I always used to have the lobster sandwich and the burger. (\u00a320 each back then)Since then they opened up in other locations in London and to my delight they also introduced large lobsters up to 8lb but these are very expensive although good. The soho branch has a very nice atmosphere nice bar area but it's very very busy in the evening and starting from 6pm you may have to wait up to one hour plus to be seated. The other location in the W hotel has the same menu but lack of any kind of atmosphere. However it's easy to get seated quick. The prices are too high if you err from the normal lobster but the service friendly and fast",

I'd strongly advise going for the lobster again you have to choices to have it boiled or grilled. I'd definitely go with grilled as it offers a smokey taste to the lobster. Obviously it's not the most meaty fish so you pick at what you can.The atmosphere is great, and it's a good experience most of all. The menu is very basic there's a choice of lobster roll. It's not a place of a food snob but definitely a good shout for a group of people wanting to have a good experience with trying their first lobster dish!",

It seems that the steamed one is less dry.Salad aside is really good. French fries without interest: not homemade.I took the lobster burger. First surprise: it's with brie so I ask without.I hoped to really have a lobster burger but it's just the 10\u00a3 burger with a little lobster on top, so few that you can't taste eat (I est it separately to actually have the taste). Not worth the 9\u00a3 on top of the classical burger (that is really good though). Paying 19\u00a3 (so same price that the lobster alone) was not worth it.If you go there, either take a classical burger or lobster. Don't mix :)Service not that good (many mistakes were done) and not very quick.Great location.",

She showed great leadership and I am sure she will be running the company at some point. Impressive for someone her age to be so aware as to how to treat people and make sure all is well. If I was her boss I would make sure I do all I could not to lose her. If you get a chance to make it in, order a burger as they are all great and tell Agata thank you.",

Of course, theres only three choice on the menu! \u00a320 whatever choice you make. The lobster roll is to die for! Beautiful combination of cold lobster with garlic butter inside a buttery warm brioche bread... Just too good!

Service was great here, the waiter told us we could get everything split in 3s, so they cut the lobster roll and the burger for us, which was great. He was also super friendly and came to check on us every once in a while. We can split checks easily and he even gave us recommendations on what we could do in London. Overall the food was pretty good, probably one of the best we've had in London (we only went to maybe 10-12 restaurants during our stay), but I've had burger & lobster before in New York and I think the New York version was even better. I'd recommend coming here and trying if you've never been. We had a really good experience and a great time here. The only downside was the wait, it was quite long. I think we waited about 30-45 minuted before getting our seats. I'd say put your name down first and go walk around until it's 30 minutes after to come back.",

It's surprising that this restaurant is so busy and only serves those 3 dishes is somewhat amusing. On our first visit, we had to wait an hour for a table. Good thing they have a cozy waiting area where you can have some drinks. On our second visit, we had to wait two hours for a table. The waiting time here is absolutely crazy but it makes up for the quality of food that they serve. On both visits, we had Lobster and Burger. The combination of these two dishes was heavenly. Lobster was very juicy. The garlic lemon butter sauce was the cherry on top. The fries were also superb. On my first visit, service was so so... Oh and I have to remind everyone that you have to check your bill before paying since this place is always so packed, there is a big chance you might get the other tables check, which was the case for us. We were so contented and happy with our dinner that we failed to check the bill. We ended up paying \u00a3140 for 2 lobster and 1 burger dish, which should've been just \u00a360. Oh well, charge it to experience.On our second visit, service was way better. The server was more attentive and made sure that the food will be brought out right away since we were so famished after two hours of waiting. I will definitely come back to Lobster and Burger when I visit London again.",

    "text": "Like most of Soho, Burger & Lobster was packed with large groups of tourists on a Thursday night. A friend and I arrived around 8pm, and had to wait 30 minutes for a table. Luckily, they took her number so we were able to go elsewhere for a glass of wine while we waited, which didn't put me off the long-ish wait. When we got our call, we hurried on over and were quickly seated. Now, if you haven't been before there are three things on the menu: 1. Burger2. Lobster3. Lobster RollAll the dishes are the same price and neither of us could make a decision between the lobster or lobster roll, so we each ordered one and went halvsies so we could try both. On one hand that was a good decision, and the other... not so much. The pro is that both meals were delicious (the lobster roll was overflowing with lobster and packed into a buttery roll; the lobster was cooked perfectly and the meat was tasty), but the con is that, when split in half, neither felt filling enough and we both left just a little bit hungry. Not ideal when a main is \u00a320, but now we know. I'll definitely be back, and next time I'll be ordering the lobster... or maybe the lobster roll... Hmm...",

    "text": "Hey, hey, looks who's about two years behind everyone else? Well, what can I say, I'm skeptical. Why? Because I've never believed that you're going to get your money's worth in a place like this. How could they make a profit selling a decent sized lobster for \u00a320? Well, it's a question I solved last night. We waited an hour and a half to get a table here. It's such a tourist place, literally heaving with Japanese teenagers! It's basically the 2015 version of a Hard Rock Cafe. Complete with staff singing the American Happy Birthday song a total of 4 times when we were there. And the food came out FAST. Well, when you only serve 3 things, they are obviously constantly being cooked. It's very much a production line affair. We had decided to go for a lobster and a lobster roll and share and I'm really torn as to what I preferred as I wasn't satisfied with sharing. They just aren't enough on a half basis to satisfy you. The lobster roll was buttery and delicious, stuffed with lobster meat and once I had half, I desperately wanted the other half. The lobster had good chunks of meat to be dipped in buttery sauce, but was a bit fiddly and I wanted to be eating the other half as well. The fries were fine, maybe could be kicked up a notch with some parmesan cheese or truffle oil. All in all, I was pleased enough with the meal and the cocktail I picked. I wouldn't come back to this location, it's just too touristy and not an enjoyable meal experience for me.",

Reasonable value - mains are \u00a320.00 but the loud 'background' music and desserts were a letdown. (When asked our (very) pleasant waitress had the volume turned down but why so loud we had to ask?) Nice cocktail list and wine choices but desserts need some work! \u00a34.95 for a cup of clumsily put- together desserts was disappointing after a half lobster, salad, lemon garlic dressing and fries. As dessert is the best part of a meal so an Eton mess with some hastily added shop-bought meringue nests took the shine off the lunchtime experience for these two diners.",

    "text": "Before coming to London, everyone recommended Burger and Lobster as a \"must try\"... so I wasn't surprised that they don't take reservations and around lunch time on a weekday, there is 30-45min wait.. at least they'll take your number and call you so you don't have to stand there the whole time.At the bar, they only have three draft beers... one was a bitter that the bartender was reluctant to server me, so I went with the Asahi... a refreshing and popular choice. Speaking of which, they've got a pretty awesome cocktail menu as well...The menu is quite simple. Burger, Lobster roll, or whole lobster.. everything is 20 pounds. Since we're from the US and have great burgers everywhere, we decide to forgo the burger and stick to the lobster dishes. The lobster roll comes with chunks of lobster meat mixed with Japanese mayo inside of a buttered and toasted brioche bun. The whole lobster comes two different ways: grilled (with a smoky flavor, but the drier choice) or steamed.. they give you some tools, so if you don't mind the manual labor.. this is probably my preferred option.Both come with a small cup of garlic butter, french fries, and a side salad. The garlic butter went well with the whole lobster... not so much with the roll... I dipped my fries in it... then tried to not think about the fat as I ate the salad...Overall, a great meal.. but 60 pounds (~$100) for lunch?? ouch!",

We were sat near the lobster room (refrigerated room with tanks full of lobsters). I saw some kids being let into it and naturally l said \"Me too!!\" \u00a0So the waitress tried to settle me and take my order while she said I'll take you once we've taken your orders. Ok i said, we ordered and then were promptly shown in to the lobster room! She said do you want to hold one I was like YES!! its the first time I held a live lobster even though it had its pincers clamps I was bricking it!I went to wash my hands and even before I returned to the table our orders had appeared!Lobsters were quite substantial they come with a gorgeous salad, chips and a pot of garlic butter.I was left feeling slightly peckish still would be nice to have a choice of additional sides.",

Trust me I have had my fare share of burgers in a lot of different places all over, burger and lobster is hands down my favorite! (The patty is quite big so if you aren't a fan of a huge patty and prefer thin and crispy ones this burger might not be your favorite but it will still be delicious!).Now for the oh so simple oh so amazingly beautiful lobster roll. I don't think there are words to describe what happens to my taste buds when I have a bite of this deliciously sinful brioche-y filled to the brim with decedent lobster goodness.

However, rather than being a trendsetter like past yelpers when this joint opened, now we find ourselves dining at B&L surrounded by crowds of CrustAsians snapping their dinners with phablets. This place has definitely appeared on the 'Chinese students in London' to-do-list.Okay, down to the food...the past reviews are spot on, this is a great place and when it boils down to it, it's great value too - as long as (a) you don't get the burger, and (b) you're comparing to London lobster prices not those of Maine, Canada or wherever.We went with a steamed lobster on one plate and a lobster roll on another. The steamed lobster was enjoyable but not that special, it tasted more like a grilled one than freshly steamed. I suspect it was steamed and then left lying around a bit too long before it got to our plate. In contrast, our neighbors bought one of the giant market price lobsters to share and golly did that look good. You could spot the steamed freshness in the shine of the meat. The slightly disappointing lobster may be one thing, but the lobster roll is epic. I've had both the cheapest and the priciest of lobster rolls in the lobster-mad city of Boston, but B&L in London does them better! The buttered bread is what kills it. What an awesome roll it is!Now here's a game for next time you visit B&L - spot the person who got the burger. Who buys a 20 quid burger?",

You can only book (depending on which location you visit) when there is about 6 of you. Luckily for us, over bank holiday weekend there was. If you're planning a romantic meal there, unless you arrive early/at a time when noone else is there, you've got to queue, according to the website - sorry not sorry. 2. There is a limited menu and it is all \u00a320. Order either a lobster, (steamed and/or grilled), a Lobster Roll or a Burger (hence the name right). That's the beauty of it, no fuss, pick one, yum yum.3. Each dish comes with salad and fries. Drinks are reasonably (London) priced, however they add a service charge. Our lunch cost \u00a328 each.4. Pick lobster, you can eat burgers at some many other restaurant. Lobster is the one. The meat was really juicy and tasty, not particularly fishy as you might expect, and was so good dipped in the lemony, buttery sauce they serve it with!5. You get to manhandle it with the claw breakers, poke out little extra yummy bits with the prodder thing you get and finally, wear a bib! Seriously, what's not to love!",

    "text": "So you get three menu choices here: 10pound beef burger, steamed or grilled lobster or lobster roll. That's it, but that is more than a enough, believe me. The menu at the table is a drinks menu. The three choices I mentioned above, all come with fries and salad.There's no reservations here, or rather just turn up early out your name down and wait an hour. But it's Soho you'll find someplace to waste an hour in. We turned up after our hour and there was plenty of space, but still busy and loud. We ordered beer and El presidente cocktail. The waiter brought our my cocktail \u00a0in a manner that which he told us he was El presidente. \u00a0Hmph.The lobster was very good, just so very much to eat. I nominated my partner to do all the hard labour of cracking the claws which had pre cuts in it to assist with the cracking. The lobster was cut into two halves each so you've got more than your fair share to somehow eat that all up.The waiter was friendly and prompt always checking in on us for some reason like we were going to implode at the table from lobster meat.They provide a bib and all the utensils required when eating this type of seafood. I tried to see if any tables nearby had ordered the burger or roll but it seems the lobster is the most popular.Either way I would recommend to others but I'm not sure I'm strong enough to go again anytime soon.",

We went at 8pm on a Sunday - and the line was already out the door to even get on the waitlist. Once we made our way to the hostess, she told us it was about an hour and a half wait. We decided to put our names down, go to Kings Cross to take a picture at Platform 9 3/4 (because I'm a tourist), and back to Burgers and Lobster in 70 minutes. Pretty efficient and good use of our time I would say. Once seated we were told of our 3 options - burger, whole lobster, or lobster roll for \u00a320.00 each. No menu was provided or needed. We both opted for the lobster roll, which comes with fries/small salad, and we asked for butter dressing on the side. The food arrived quickly. The lobster roll tasted great with good chunks of meat. The sides - fries and salad, were also really delicious. Not cheap for a roll but its fresh lobster and really delicious. Would come back to try the full lobster.",

Dingcoming to burger & lobster was one of the best decision i made during my trip to the UK. although the place was small and there's a long wait. it was totally worth it every bit!!!!ordered:*a cheeseburger which comes with fries-20 pounds honestly i don't think it was the best burger i've had but it definitely was not bad at all. the fries was amazing!! i couldn't stop eating those little suckers!*a lobster roll with the garlic butter sauce which comes with fries-20 pounds-heaven oh heaven in every bite! definitely delicious and they are not stingy on the lobster. so definitely worth every hard earn penny. let's just say it was so good that a friend ordered another one to share with my husband. if you're coming with others its okay to share/split that way you can try a little bit of everything. burger and lobster has only 3 items on their menu. what we didn't order was the lobster which you'll get to wear a cute little bib. they use the same lobster on the lobster roll so i didn't feel like i missed out on much. plus saved me the time of cracking and peeling to eat my food. each item on their food menu is 20 pounds. which in the US equals $40 for each item. my party and i didn't have much expectations but when we found out that it was 20 pounds per item we were like it better be good. surprisingly the four of us enjoyed every bite. for the rest of our UK trip we kept thinking about how good the lobster roll was. tips:*restroom is located all the way in the back. separated by gender.*cash and credit card accepted*3 food items on the menu*serves alcohol *small seating area for waiting. *you can provide your phone number and they will call you when a table is ready.*indoor seating only.",

There is no such thing as no wait at this branch. We came at 5pm and had to wait over an hour for our table, but the nice thing is that they take down your number so you can pop on over to a nearby pub for a drink!The restaurant is spacious but has a warm feeling to it. Our server was prompt and attentive. The service was very quick too! Huge plus.We both ordered the steamed lobster. It was amazing. Very sweet and juicy lobster meat. They already cut the lobster in half and crack the claws so very minimal work is required on the customer's end. The garlic butter sauce is also to die for. We were debating asking for another side of the sauce because it was THAT good. Every meal comes with a side of salad and chips which are also very tasty!Very delicious meal, I will definitely be returning!",

    "text": "Disclaimer: my review is based on the burger. \u00a0The reason I'm just reviewing the burger is because of a allergy to lobster that I sadly have to deal with! Burger & Lobster have just three food items that they serve: Lobster, Lobster roll, or Burger. \u00a0Each selection is served with fries and salad and costs \u00a320. \u00a0Burger & Lobster basically invented the \"limited-repertoire\" menu which seems to be the cool, hip thing in London now.Was it a good burger? \u00a0Yes. \u00a0Was it a \u00a320 burger? Probably not... but changing that would ruin the easy to explain pricing system, I guess.Let's face it, \u00a320 is perfectly acceptable for a whole 1 kilo lobster or an overflowing lobster roll. \u00a0However, 20 quid for a burger is pricey and means one expects more; maybe some truffle or foie gras? The burger was cooked perfectly, served with crispy bacon and melted cheese. \u00a0It had a fresh, thick slice of tomato and gherkins and sat atop a bed of lettuce on a mildly seeded (ugh) bun. \u00a0The fries it came with were a generous portion and nicely crisp, but I could've done without the side salad and a few quid back instead. \u00a0Even though this was a great burger, I don't want to pay more than \u00a315 for it. \u00a0If they hope to compete with Gaucho or Hawksmoor for the upscale burger crowd, then they definitely need to reevaluate things. \u00a0Of course, you may not have my crippling disability for eating shellfish, so you'll be just fine with your lobster.Burger & Lobster have basically ended up with an underpriced lobster and an over-priced burger. The restaurant itself is cool, but loud. \u00a0Good service and a nice atmosphere means it's not the place for a romantic rendezvous, but a nice place for some drinks with the crew. \u00a0I write more about it on beeffanatic.com, so give it a read!",

I've ordered the combination platter that comes with a burger and a lobster with fries and salad as sides so that I can try both things at once. It cost \u00a332 for the platter. It would be wise to add either cheese or bacon in the burger as its pretty plain. The cheese add in flavors and it's nice to eat it while it's warm as it melts. I've asked for half grill half steam for the lobster and I enjoyed the grilled lobster better as it had more flavor with it. The special sauce goes well with the lobster and I've added more to the steam lobster to give it more taste. Fries were average as well, and kinda soggy. The service is great as the workers there are nice and energetic! Make sure to make reservation to avoid the long line, and be there early as they are very strict on their reservation policy.",

They said you must try B&L while in London!Obviously I ordered the whole lobster. Steamed and then grilled with lemon garlic sauce, plus fries, and salad. Ordered the Hawaiian punch also (refreshing!).I honestly think that the lobster was sub par (boo!). Yes, sorry. It was a bit to dry for my liking and lack the sweet taste of fresh lobster. Probably I should have ordered the steam one only. Oh well....But for \u00a320 in the insanely expensive London? Sure, this is a steal!!!",

You wont be disappointed!!!!If you love lobster and you are visiting London, you must visit this place!I would avoid the bruger..... at \u00a320, its not worth it!!!!",

    "text": "Best lobster roll of my life. Granted i'm only had 2 previously (one in Boston and one in Long Island) \u00a0So much lobster, perfect amount of mayo, perfectly toasted brioche bun. So so good. Why doesn't this place have a michelin star??? Definitely worth going out of your way for. Visiting from NYC and my friend from college who lived in Boston previously strongly recommended this place. So worth it. Went at 5:15pm on a Monday night and there was no wait. I was still waiting for my friend to arrive so I put my name down and then waited at a table and looked at the drink menu (of note there is no food menu). A guy came over to have my drink order and after telling him what I like he suggested a ivory gimlet, a drink that was not on the menu, but had champange, mint and vodka. It was delicious. When my friend came at 5:30 we were seated immediately. Service was very good. Food came out very quickly. She had the grilled lobster. Which she enjoyed immensely.of note - I'm a small girl (5'2\" 105 lbs) and eat a lot less than most people. I ate the entire lobster roll, some of the salad and no fries and I was very satisfied. If you're larger than me you might feel like it the lobster roll was not enough. For me it was perfect.",

I went with friends and we tried all 3 items. It's more about the lobster, but the burger was also great. It's kind of like diner meets upscale. And it really works. We also have the cheese cake and brownie Sundae for dessert. Both were great, but I have to say the cheesecake was better. The wait was long, however; you can put your name in and go elsewhere while you wait and they will call you to let you know you are getting close. Finally the prices are reasonable for what you get.

Came in a little container (like a yogurt almost) and I saw the girl talk it out of a fridge, so might not have been very fresh. \u00a0Wouldn't bother with dessert at this place again.Came back with a group of girls, and wanted to make a reso, but they only do them for 6+ people. \u00a0There was only 5 of us but I made the reso for 6 and they didn't give us trouble about it. \u00a0So that was a plus! As others have said, volume is really high, but it creates a fun, high energy party atmosphere. A great place to have a good meal in a fun environment.",

I went to visit my friend who lives in London, and works for Burger and Lobster, and she wanted to show me where she worked, so we had dinner here. First of all, there are 3 meals: A burger, A lobster, and a lobster roll. We decided to get a burger and a lobster and split them. We got a little bit bigger of a lobster at an additional cost, but it was worth it. The best burger of my life with sweet pickles, tomato, cheese, bacon and 2 types of beef. The lobster comes pre-cracked for you, and as someone who eats lobster and lived in Maine for a while, I do take it as an insult when someone else cracks my lobster for me. That was until I had B&L crack my lobster for me. B&L cracked the lobster appropriately so that I did not need to do a whole lot of work when getting the meat out. The cracks were not obvious and did not ruin the presentation of the lobster. You get an option of two butters, a regular melted butter and a creamy garlic. I was able to try both, and even though I like melted butter better, they were both fantastic. Also served with your meal is a side salad, equally as delicious as the rest of the meal. For desert we tried a chocolate mousse with chocolate cornflakes on top, and a caramel grand marnier drizzled mousse with graham cracker crumbs. Incredible. \u00a0I highly, highly recommend stopping here for dinner if you are in London. Especially if you are looking for something with a low key atmosphere, and 5 star food. Service was impeccable as well.",

    "text": "I have to admit, that I haven't yet made it to their original location in Mayfair. But anyway, I was at their newly opened Soho restaurant and enjoyed it very much. Burger & Lobster offers a very basic menu, but what it offers is really quality food. It's not a cheap burger shop, but I find it worth the price. The restaurant looks a bit like any random American diner, nothing special really, but the atmosphere is good, the staff very friendly and it is overall a nice place.I went for the burger option and homemade lemonade. The lemonade tasted amazing, although there were probably more ice cubes in the glass than lemonade. Anyway, I really liked it.The big burger came with a salad and fries on the side. Now, the fries didn't look spectacular. Burger & Lobster does thin McDonald's kind of fries, but it does them perfectly. They were incredibly crispy and very tasty. The burger itself looks good and the patty is just as good as you would expect. The cheese and the bacon and everything is great, just the bun wasn't perfect for me. Perhaps because the bottom slice was slightly too thin, after a few bites it became difficult to avoid a big mess. The bottom slice disintegrated slowly and then couldn't really cope with the big patty and all the rest. Anyway, the simple but delicious and big burger is definitely one of the better burgers you can get in London. The dessert then came in a paper cup. So the first impression wasn't the best, but inside, it looked good and the mousse with nuts tasted very good, so besides the packaging nothing to complain. Altogether, a somewhat expensive but filling and satisfying experience. It's perhaps worth to note, that if you like Burger & Lobster, you might also be interested in it's new neighbour, Honest Burgers Soho. I was surprised, that both new restaurants were so near to each other, but as I like both, I don't mind. I will simply visit both from time to time :)",

I got the lobster, which was very juicy and delicious especially with the garlic sauce. The salad was also made fresh. I also ordered the Abfab cocktail, but it had too much ice and was not worth the money. The restaurant had a nice vibe although the music was a bit too loud.While the food was great and I would recommend that people go there at least once, I feel like this place is a bit overrated. It would be a nice place to come with a bigger group of people.",

This is great for girls I think because the roll or the lobster on its own isn't too light or heavy for a meal. I think the burger isn't anything special for the price. The lobster dishes might not be enough for the average guy. My boyfriend thought it was nice but he walked out still hungry and it's not a cheap place. Despite what he thinks I'd still recommend it!",

There is no way that this lobster is fresh on the premises as claimed, it is as tough as rubber (seriously) and chewy like nothing else on the planet! Grilled or steamed, it is tough, the sort of lobster you get only after it has been frozen. You may as well go to Iceland in the high street for \u00a310 and nurture a frozen one for the same effect. \u00a0One of the claws on the lobster was as it should be, soft, flaky with excellent flavour, perhaps they mix fresh with frozen? There is a lot of hype with this restaurant but we will not be going back. Wonderful staff and a nice glass of beer though! : )",

( there is an extra fourth option of a bigger lobster if you want to share! you can even go to the tanks and pick out the one you want). In my opinion I wouldn't go for the burger, it really isn't worth \u00a320, the lobster was OK, giving people baby bibs was a nice touch but the star of the show was the lobster roll! It was so sweet and succulent. A good selection of drinks, it even had my favourite Brooklyn Beer, happy days, but a bit overpriced. By this point you wonder where is the hip? The decor was a nice, having all the light bulbs at different levels was a nice touch. But most important of all was the vibe! this really has a nice chilled out vibe and a great place to chat during dinner. Splitting the check was simply!",

    "text": "I must have been to this place a dozen of times by now. \u00a0Somehow, this place has become the quintessential London dining experience for Asian tourists. \u00a0All my visiting Asian friends seem to request a meal there and the ones I took there all really liked it. Every time I went there I saw hordes of Asian tourists. \u00a0I think there must be a certain attraction to the Asian mindset stemming from lobster being an expensive food item and a \u00a320 bargain in Soho. So I have learnt to bring all my Asian visitors to Burger & Lobster. I even devised a special routine - if you go around 6 pm it's usually a 40 - 60 mins wait but if you go at 7 - 8 pm expect a longer wait of 90 - 120 mins on a typical weekend. \u00a0Usually I will put my name and number down and have them call me, then head off to China Town for some snack and bubble tea. \u00a0That worked perfectly. \u00a0So I was a bit sad when they told me last week that their new policy was that I need to wait at the restaurant and I cannot leave my number and wander off. \u00a0Crap!The lobster and lobster roll are decent. \u00a0If I am lazy I go for the roll. \u00a0The fries are good too. \u00a0But I have had better lobster and lobster roll before. Taking in everything though (price, location, service), this is a good deal. \u00a0Service is always good and efficient, and definitely above average in London. Every time I go there I still ask myself, why would someone order burger when they pay the same for a lobster? Alas, my Asian side prevails. That burger has to wait for another day.",

I am happy to say I loved it and I had the best lobster roll sandwich I have ever had here.Came with a group of 4 and all of us loved the food. Wait was about 10 minutes and once seated service was good and quick. Place is a bit pricey but they give you a generous amount of fresh lobster so I thought it was well worth the price. Lobster is placed in a home made bun that was toasted and buttered to perfection. The thing that puts this place over the edge is the garlic butter they use. It is not like the see through flavorless butter you get in the states. This one was creamy and delicious and the perfect thing to add to the sandwich to take it from great to amazing. Fries and salad that come with meal were both great too.The one thing I felt a bit ripped off on was the drink. We ordered the award winning drink they have (don't remember name, something fizzy) and they filled the cup over with huge ice cubes in a tiny glass so even though glass looked full it was about 4 sips at 12 pounds which was just way too much for the size of the drink. We did not order anymore drinks when we saw their ice cube trick they use to give less product to customer.Stick to the food and avoid the cocktails and you will have a great meal!",

Doesn't really give you an idea of what your in for but I like simple. Having the bar stools at the front is smart, plenty of seating for people waiting and having the menu ready allows you to kill some time before you get seated as it's often busy. Probably getting in the door early is better for a place like this. Service: 5 stars- despite the wait everyone was friendly and we were seated reasonably quick. Our waitress was lovely, very helpful, & friendly. She gave us a great suggestion on cocktails and was on her way. I felt they moved quickly and once your seated your in and out.Food: 4 stars- overall good. I'm a fan of a more upscale traditional lobster tail. But the medium/large char grilled lobster tail was pretty fabulous. The garlic butter on the side is the way to go and shoestring fries you can't go wrong. Overall filling and tasty. I will say 9/10 had lobster opposed to a burger so I think the lobster is the way to go.Their cocktails here are the BOMB! The shared drinks are fun and delicious. The strawberry goblet (can't remember the legit name) was out of this world. Girly but definitely had the right amount of booze. I say treat yourself and go for it. Overall this place is fun, simplistic, good food, and a fresh idea. I can see why it's so popular. Worth trying at least once.",

When my friend suggested we go for lobster in London, I'll admit I was a little hesitant; however, I was put at ease upon seeing the hoards of people when we walked in. I figured if everyone was flocking to Burger & Lobster, it must be great!We had to wait about 30 minutes on a Sunday for dinner but I was able to make my way to the bar and order a bottle of wine for us to sip on while waiting. Eventually we were seated and not given any menus. Why? It's pretty easy for the waiter to explain. You can get lobster (steamed or grilled), a lobster roll, or burger. Each costs 20 pounds. Simple enough!We all went with lobster which also came with fries and a salad. I asked for it grilled but you could also do half steamed and half grilled, if you prefer. Our waiter said it pretty much tastes the same either way. The plates came out pretty quickly and we started to devour. The lobster was meaty and I was definitely filled up when the sides were added to the mix. As I ate and looked around, I was seriously in awe of how something so simple not only exists but thrives. There are other locations throughout the city and we saw one being built not even a five minute walk away. Why stop at Burger & Lobster? I'm thinkin' Ribs & Tacos, Chicken & Lechon, Bratwurst & Steak... Combinations are endless!",

We also shared a Hawaii cooler, a bigger glass than my face! The drink is alcohol free, like a mixer soft drink with lychee, pineapple and cherry. Service guys are really nice and always smiling and welcome to explain the menu. Even though it was the most expensive meal we had in London, but we really enjoyed it.

I have been having lobster since the tender age of 10 and I'm glad I have found somewhere reasonably priced to get my lobster fix. Lobster used to be a treat but because of burger and lobster, I have the luxury of having it whenever I want. I feel like a winner! In this casual eatery you can get either a beef burger or full lobster (shelled or in a roll) for \u00a320! Fantastic idea for the quality of food! You can also have a \u00a330 lobster and lobster by weight. Last time I ate here there were two people sharing and \u00a3150 lobster, so it does vary. Your lobster can be steamed or steamed & grilled, in a juicy herbed garlic sauce, and it comes with delicious side of french fries and a leafy salad. The drinks menu is quite varied and the averages \u00a39. Not to bad for a classy meal in central London!As you will devour your food quite quickly and like no one is watching, \u00a0you are provided with a plastic bib (like a 3-year old) and a lobster fork, to get to the nitty gritty's! This is a great place to come as a group for a special occasion. Also, a word of advice, put your name down on the list; it gets real busy!",

So butterly good, the lobster here made me try and get every morsel out of the shell that I could. Everything at Burger & Lobster costs 20 pounds, so I got the burger and my friend ordered the lobster, which we then shared. You also get a side salad and nice, plump fries. This may have been my best meal in a long while. The burger was cooked perfectly, and while difficult to eat due to its size, tasted great (and what burger isn't overly difficult to eat now?). And you already know about the lobster. It was so good I'd repeat, but that'd be boring. The noise level is extremely high, so be ready to bring your loud voice. I think my friend and I said \"what?\" every minute or so. Also, top notch toilets here with amazing hand soap and lotion.",

All comes with chips and salad at GBP20:Lobster (grill or steamed)BurgerLobster rollQuality of salad, chips are up to standandard.Burger was chunky. I of course love Shakeshuck one, the best ever, but I must say that burger here was good too. Meat was juicy and chunky so if you are hungry, this will satisfy you. The seafood lover cannot stop poking and digging this lobster. It was grilled but plumpy lobster goes well with garlic butter they provide with. You may need to be patient digging meats in shells but I enjoyed doing it as I don't want to eat meal very quickly. We were there almost three hours to \u00a0finish this lobster but nobody asked us to hurry up while people were waiting outside. Nice. (well we wait for 30 min to get in, so I expect people to wait for us too)The chair and table are big enough. The waiters are friendly yet polite. The restaurant was very busy. They told me that this is normal for them so its operation must be very efficient.Conclusion is value for money, ou get good food with modern atomosphere. Overall 4!Personally I like the paints they have on the wall.",

But I had heard good things about this place, and I had promised my work friends i would go.It has an an alpine lodge/nordic inside - wooden walls and spacious.it was rammed for a Monday nigth in jan! was shocked by that, and I hoped the food was good. We had drinks before being seated ( wine wasnt cheap but weas delicious and ice cold in large clean glasses). The bar was large and the restuarnat itself large.The atmosphere was buzzing and busy and trendy.We were seated at a great table in the middle of the restaurant.Service was friendly and efficient and organised.No menus as its simply steak or lobster.but they have a large drinks meny - the cocktais looked delicious.The food was amazing. You get a whole tray of food for \u00a320 - a big pot of salty hot delicious fries, and a delicious side salad with crouons and cheese on, and then either a whole lobster with garlicy lemon butter to pour all over, or a brioche roll stuffed with shredded lobster, or what I went for (a delicious melting meaty huge cheeseburger with pickles and bacon).Its easily the best burger I've ever eaten since I've lived in London for the last 6 years. The Hawksmoor burger came close but it had a funny bone marrow taste and was a little too muchy. Plus this was bigger.For \u00a320 plus drinks it wasnt cheap but nor extortionate either,a nd the experience was well worth the money. The prices were reflected everywhere int he decor, the staff and the general quality.I am already planning when to go back.Ps. the secret is to go in a big group and book (they take reservations for 6 or more), and the bill is simple to split.",

Had seen the silly queues outside the Soho branch before but as it was a rainy Sunday we waited 5 mins at the bar before our table was ready. Ended up staying at the bar. Tenders were friendly. Beers were cold.Basically you are knocking yourself if you don't have a lobster as it appears the expensive burgers subsidise the fairly reasonable lobsters costs. We had a burger and ordered a larger lobster off the board for \u00a340. It was excellent, plenty of flesh and not overly grilled. Burger was good, standard fare nowadays, brioche, cheese, bacon etc. The meat wasn't particularly flavoursome but was cooked right. Not enough fries!!Oh and by the looks of the lobster roll i'd swerve that. Teeny weeny. Atmosphere was lively and service good. Doubt i'd queue an hour to get in. Worth a look tho.",

I always look at people who just bought a burger for \u00a320 in a lobster restaurant and give them one of my looks that says: seriously?! I think you get the idea. Enjoy the lobster. I prefer a steamed one. Also you can choose a larger that the standard 800g lobster. Apparently the big lobsters taste the same as lobster is one of the few animals that tastes the same even when old. If you buy one of the larger ones you'll also get bottomless fries and salad.Do expect to wait though or come early. Last I went we had to wait for 1.5 hours arriving at 7pm on Tuesday.

The lobster was great value for \u00a320, but the burger didn't seem quite worth the \u00a320. For both dishes, they came with really good fries, and a mediocre salad. Although only a small side, I was a little disappointed by the salad...feel like it could have been easy to make it much better. We also shared \u00a0a tiramisu for dessert, which was really quite disappointing. We mentioned this to the waitress, who promised to pass it along to the chef...hoping they improve that! The cocktails were nice, but didn't feel they quite merited the \u00a39.50 price tag. The decor and ambiance is great, and by coming a bit earlier in the evening, we avoidedruth the long wait and over crowding. The service was also good, and all the staff memebers i dealt with were really friendly and helpful.Overall, great evening!",

Usually packed (per my friend) but the wait is usually short. By the time we visited the bar & had our drinks our table was ready.I ordered the grilled lobster (followed what my friend ordered & she insisted grilled) & H opted for the B&L because he can never pass up a burger. The food came out quickly & boy howdy was it ever so good! The salad had crispy veggies with a tangy vinaigrette, the lobster grilled just right, crispy-tender chips & my oh my the drawn herbed butter. H said his burger was top notch, juicy & chock full of flavor. Really enjoyed our meal! The service was spot on, fast & the food delicious.",

However, two of our party got food poisoning from the \"house butter\", evidenced by the fact only they chose to douse their rolls in the sauce and we all got the lobster/lobster rolls. I had thought it smelled a bit strange, but put it off as just unsuited to my taste. The worst part was definitely the food poisoning itself, but a close second was how our server reacted when he came by to collect the check and saw us all freaking out about my dad breaking out in cold sweat, nearly unresponsive, and about to faint. We urgently asked him for cold water and napkins and he just slowly collected and counted the money we left on the bill with no regard for someone obviously unwell. Luckily my dad recovered enough so we could head out and taxi back to the hotel, and he and brother were fine after spending some time in the bathroom. The other aspects of the Soho location were pretty good: we didn't have a wait to be seated, most of the staff was polite if a bit rushed, and the setting was pretty classy. However, the food poisoning and the unprofessionalism shown by the server makes us wary of returning to any of their restaurants. I cannot recommend this place, but if you do, take a whiff of their sauces and food before eating.",

    "text": "Lobster, yum! Give me more!! :)I have anxiously awaited my visit to this well known establishment as it has affordable and tasty lobsters or if you're so inclined, beef burgers or a bit of both! Apparently the menu has changed from the original, expanding to include different sizes and toppings.On this occasion I went with the original whole lobster and thanks to the waitress' suggestion, I got it half grilled and half steamed. Most dishes come with a side of fries and salad in addition to the creamy butter to dip. My dining companion went with the lobster roll which looked equally divine and we were set! The lobster was juicy, flavourful and cooked perfectly. It was easy to pop out of the shell and enjoy its goodness.We also started with the lobster chowder which I will admit was hard to find chunks of lobster amongst the vegetables. However there was no denying the rich lobster flavour and it easily went down especially when shared.They boast an impressive drink menu as well. A range of specialty and traditional cocktails. The Tokyo Dream ended up a bit too tart for me but actually paired well with the meal. I could eat here once a week and hope this chain expands to other countries. The US could do with less Red Lobster in place of this gem. Not to mention the service was stellar and prompt, considering the busy time.",

I got the lobster burger and siracha mayo which were both a little disappointing to me. Most dishes were in the \u00a320-\u00a330ish range. Overall, great food and fun atmosphere",

Definetly wasn't what i expected from my friend's and yelp's reviews. Red Lobster in America has better lobsters and In-n-out has better burgers. But hey, you get what you paid for right? Restaurant isn't expensive. The feel of the restaurant and quality of the food can be best described as \"fast casual\" along the lines of Panera Bread or Corner Bakery in America. Better feel/food then most typical fast food restaurants but not as good as actual sit down restaurants.",

    "text": "Probably the best lobster you can find in London.I came to Burger & Lobster after it was recommended to me by a coworker. I arrived around 7pm on a Friday night and it was packed. They were able to seat me immediately at the bar so I jumped at the chance. I was greeted by the bartender and promptly given a menu. After a quick look I realized I couldn't pick between a burger or lobster so I decided I just needed to have both. Ordered the combo with a medium burger with cheese and a half steamed, half grilled lobster. Literally 4 minutes later the plate was in front of me. The burger had a decent sized patty and plenty of toppings. The lobster had a smell to it but not bad. It was a beautiful bright red color with much of the meat exposed. I dipped a small bit in the buttery sauce provided. The flavor was wonderful and I quickly devoured the rest of the lobster. The only negatives were that fries that came out were cold and if I would have been with a larger group the wait would have easily been over an hour. In total I was maybe in the restaurant for 30 minutes. Service was quick and thorough. I would recommend people try Burger & Lobster. Manage your expectations though.",

Came here on a rainy Tuesday evening, hoping against all odds that the wait would be reasonably short for a table for two. We were told an hour to an hour and a half. Fair enough. We went to a pub down the street. 30 minutes later, my mobile rang and our table was nearly ready. Not bad; but I wish they had given us a more realistic time frame from the start!My dining companion had never tasted lobster before in his life so decided to play it safe with the lobster roll (lest he not be able to crack open the lobster). I opted for the lobster. Both options were absolutely worth the 20 quid tag. The lobster was steamed to perfection, juicy and succulent. I tried my best to get out every piece of meat. The lobster roll was also quite tasty, served on a toasty and buttery bun with lots of meat. All in all, I enjoyed my experience at B&L. I think next time I'll try to go in a group of 3 to get a bit of everything. Although I think the lobster is most def the better deal, I'm curious about this \u00a320 burger!",

There's also an exceptional garlic sauce that is most moreish.Everything is \u00a320 except a selection of overweight lobsters which weigh from 2 to an obscene 7 pounds, enough to feed an oligarch's ego.

Great presentation, good-sized lobster, and pretty good value for money.Tip: It's always packed and they don't take bookings for tables under 6 people, but you can give the hostess your number and they'll call you when your table is ready. When I went, the wait was 1.5 hours so we just shopped for Halloween costume accessories and had a wander. Perfect if you're not dying of starvation.I had the lobster grilled with garlic butter (because why would you have un-garlicked butter?? even if I was on a date, I'd ask for garlic because a] I love garlic more than I love people and b] he'd have to get used to it eventually, because it's happening). It comes with a side of chips and salad. Usually I feel like places focus on the main and \u00a0the sides play second fiddle. These chips were sooooo tasty! Perfectly crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, salty. The salad was dressed well and the vinaigrette did well to cut the richness of the butter I so lovingly attempted to drown the lobster with.",

Environment is laid out very well with the waiting area for drinks only with an occasional dish of popcorn coming your way. They give you a ticket to associate the bill with when in the waiting area so they can transfer the bill when you get seated. Menu is set up to be a selection of one of the three options: Lobster, Lobster Roll or Burger. All come with the same sides, chips and small salad. Lobster and lobster roll are probably the reasons why you come here. Both solid, but not meeting the expectations of the place. Burger is solid as well, but for 20 pounds, it's not worth it.Drinks were interesting as well as they can be hit or miss. Might want to stick with a drink you're familiar with and go with that for the night.Overall a good spot, long wait time with so many people coming through, decent food, hit or miss drinks and a definite try once, but not sure about a return visit.",

My friend went at 4:30 to stand in line and we ate at 6:30 almost...But I guess if you want something decent to eat in London you have to wait. And it's totally worth it!!

And the best is that for 30\u00a3 \u00a0they include two amazing desserts as a combo - cheesecake with a cream that is made in heaven and apple crumble ice cream!

Did not like that they included the desserts in the bill but it was a mistake that was rectified immediately. Do not like the 12.5% tip that they add on the bill as well? even if it is discretionary they should not do it... People would pay the tip for sure! You have the choice to go up to a 5 kilo lobster for about 300\u00a3 so depends on your pocket money the choice is yours ;)",

    "text": "WOW! It's been a few weeks since I got back from London and I still want to go back to Burger and Lobster! Two menu items...- Lobster (roll, grilled, or steamed)- BurgerI got the grilled Lobster and it was fantastic! The shell was cracked just as needed and they provide the adequate bibs to keep yourself clean. What I was most impressed by was the salad. It was one of the best salads I've had in my life where it was organic greens with a hint of green onions and a small tomato.The only big downside was the drinks. 10 pounds for a drink that was 90% ice and the fries weren't as good as the one in the states. Other than that, it's a must try if you're there for the first time.Very nice ambiance. I'd recommend going earlier in the dinner hour to avoid the 1 hour wait.",

    "text": "\"This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the burger - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the lobster - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.\"Ok, so the choice isn't quite that simple as Burger and Lobster offer lobster sandwiched in a brioche roll, as well as large sharing lobsters, proudly displayed by weight - Hawksmoor style - on a blackboard at the front of the restaurant. n On top of this, you may request either a steamed or grilled lobster. \u00a0However, if I had mentioned this before, I wouldn't have been able to use a Matrix quote in here, so there. \u00a0All items - except for the lobster board - are \u00a320 and served with chips and salad, and the lobster is served with a garlic lemon butter sauce. \u00a0Oh, the other option is an upgrade to a bigger lobster for \u00a310 which appealed to my utterly ridiculous gastric system, but less so to my rather more meagre wallet.Although the front of house service was distinctly lacking in warmth, our waiter was most helpful and friendly towards us, especially in reassuring some of my fellow diners that the burger is indeed worth it. \u00a0Personally, I have quite a few reservations about a \u00a320 burger - is it really going to be 2x a Hach\u00e9 burger, or 3-4x a street food one? \u00a0However, Kevin L. reassured me that the burger was excellent and that it was *actually* medium rare, unlike many other burger places.I ordered the grilled lobster and, size-wise, it didn't disappoint in the slightest. \u00a0The standard lobsters are about 1 1/2 lbs in weight and are armed with some impressive guns (claws. \u00a0Which, upon reflection, is an erroneous allusion as claws are more akin to hands. \u00a0Whatever.) \u00a0The quality of the lobster itself was great (better than the Big Easy) - I was impressed with the freshness and sweetness of the meat and my only gripe was that the meat in the body of the lobster was a little bit overcooked, which was a shame as the rest of it was perfect. \u00a0The sides were great, really good skinny chips and a small token but tasty salad (with parmesan sprinklings!). \u00a0The sauce was also tasty, although isn't overloaded with either garlic or lemon. \u00a0I love butter, so this was immaterial to me, but I guess that might disappoint some.Whilst I was busy stripping lobster meat out of every last nook and crannie (hey, it needs a proper lobster burial. \u00a0Or something. \u00a0The legs were a bit of hard work, but highly satisfying), some of my dining partners had a flick through the Burger & Lobster comic on the wall. \u00a0Far from being a children's colouring book, viewer discretion is advised, as there was a rather graphic lesbian scene in it which was a little gratuitous. \u00a0It also totally explained why it wasn't put up as reading material in the loo.Overall, I was impressed and, whilst it's not the sort of place I'd go regularly, I'd probably make a beeline for this place when my next crustacean craving kicks in. \u00a0That said, I don't know if I'm willing to brave a massive queue for the place, especially when there's so much else going on in Soho these days. \u00a0And I know that, ultimately, curiosity will get the better of me and I'm going to have to try all the other menu iterms. \u00a0Just like Pokemon. But edible.",

The restaurant was very noisy and filled with loud music, so perhaps it is not good for the elders (at least not good for my parents). I quite liked the sparking water (only 1 for each person), and we ordered almost the full menu (whole lobster, lobster tail, lobster roll, whole burger). I guess the food were generally all right, but my parents thought the lobsters were not fresh, kinda like dead for a while. So it's not decent enough it you are looking for high quality lobster.

    "text": "So lets get one thing straight. If you have a spare \u00a320 in your pocket, and presented with the choice between a burger or a lobster, you pick the burger, I'm going to assume you're either allergic to seafood or you just make poor choices in life.Burger and Lobster's premise isn't quite as simple as another similar London restaurant (Steak & Lobster, which as I later found out from the waiter, is a bit of a spin off, and there's bad blood between the two places) as you can get combo meals which for \u00a360 which includes two burgers, two half lobsters, fries and a dessert. So basically, don't go for that unless you're ravenous.Seriously.The restaurant itself is nice - there are well spaced booths in a medium lit, high ceilings room, where the entrance is adorned with multitudes of lobster tanks. You can pick out a larger lobster for a pricey sum, but they did look very good - perhaps one for a future trip!The burger (medium rare) and lobster (grilled) were alright - I wasn't particularly blown away, and the dessert menu had limited options. However, they did make very good cocktails, which kept us happily buzzing through the evening.Grab yourself a booth and a decent evening out with some messy undignified food can be had - it's a good night out.",

We waited about an hour in the bar before getting seated at our table. The staff is very attentive, friendly and sporty, joking around and interacting with the guests in a very positive way. The menu is non existing, meaning they only have lobster three ways (steamed, grilled and in a roll), and yes they also serve a burger... which honestly is not the best.We ordered all three kinds of lobster and got a burger for free. The food was amazing and fresh, all for a fixed price. I will take more business meetings there for sure!",

    "text": "There has been a recent trend in London towards restaurants which specialise in just a few dishes. Burger and Lobster opened their Mayfair branch last December and have bucked the current recession and the received wisdom against opening restaurants in the winter gloom by making so much of a success of it that they've recently opened this Soho branchTheir Mayfair branch was as legendary for its queues (no reservations taken) as its food. This Soho venue is bigger with an area available for reservationsKevin L's departure from London gave us London Yelpers the perfect excuse to pay this new branch a visit - at \u00a320 for any of its food options, sorting the bill out at the end was easy!Unfortunately, we were too late to book a table in the reserved area but I headed down early to put our name on the waiting listSadly, Burger and Lobster made a terrible first impression. When I asked for a table for 10, there was an audible sigh from the lady managing the reservation list!! I was a bit shocked to say the least but not wanting to upset someone who can decide how long you wait, I didn't say anything. However, this is not the way to greet your customers and even if you feel that you don't really care because there are hordes of people wanting to get in, it's un-professionalHappily, I managed to cheer her up eventually and we were seated after about 20 minutes. Along the way to our table, we spotted the large lobster tank with our dinner in it. I didn't see a burger tank anywhere and so can't vouch smiliarly for the freshness of the burger! The lobsters come from Canada, ensuring a year round supplyOnce seated, our server explained the almost self-explanatory menu. \u00a320 gets you a whole steamed or grilled lobster, a lobster roll or a burger. All the dishes are served with chips and salad. A little more money gets you unlimited fries and salad but the \u00a320 fed everyone on our table very satisfactorily. For a restaurant that only serves 3 dishes, it was almost criminal that the lobster roll wasn't available as they had run out of bread!My Chinese Value For Money gene was obviously only ever going to let me order the lobster. While the 2 people on our table who had the burger really enjoyed it, I still can't help feeling that the burger eaters are subsidising the lobster eaters!You do feel spoilt as a whole lobster is delivered to you. A bib with a picture of someone who looks like President Assad of Syria on it ensures that you don't get too messy but hey, that's the fun of eating a whole lobster. They supply claw crackers and picks to help you tease out every last bit of juicy sweet lobster meat but unlike some of my fellow diners, I gave up on the legsThe burger eaters did make happy murmurings and Kevin insisted I take a bite of his burger. It was good but not as good as my lobster\u00a320 for a whole lobster is great value for lobster in Central London. If you avoid ordering any drinks from their extensive drinks menu, walking out having paid \u00a322 for lobster including service charge will feel like a real stealSo, full marks for the food but minus one for the practically polar ice cold greeting and the lack of availablility of fully one third of their menu",

Good thing they have a bar so you can drink while waiting, because it was really packed and standing wouldn't have been pleasant. When we got seated, ordering was so easy. Lobster burger or lobster roll. All four of us got the lobster roll, because apparently the roll has more lobster. And what a right choice that was... the bread was buttery heaven and lobster chunks was falling out the side. Even the salad was delicious, everything was YUM!One thing I didn't like was that some of the lobster was cold, meaning it was from the fridge which dampened my expectations a bit because the food isn't cheap. But I'm really happy to have finally tried this place and I would definitely come back, but not in the near future.",

    "text": "I sold my parents on the concept of Burger and Lobster in a heartbeat. So the three of us went here for an early dinner as we had been out wandering around London all day. Now this is only my second venture to a B&L, and the first time I made the mistake of the lobster roll. I had my eye on the lobster prize this time.Then I went for the burger. Maybe I was in the mood for a burger. Maybe I just wanted to know if it was really good. I don't know. My parents both got the lobster, and I was really worried that I would have lobster envy like when I ordered the lobster roll. Luckily, I only had lobster envy in that it took my parents a long time to eat the lobster. While my burger was massive, it was so delicious I managed to scarf it down quickly. Of course I added bacon and cheese, because you want the most for your \u00a320, right? I don't know if the burger itself was worth the full \u00a320, but oh well. And I'd definitely order it again.Maybe someday I'll come back for the lobster. Maybe.",

The salad and fries are amazing, huge burger, big portions, great service, the place is always packed but you can seat at the bar (first come first serve!) and that's what we did! My girlfriend had the lobster roll, she loves it, with extra butter sauce, I am not a big fan of lobster and I can't eat garlic at all, unfortunately the butter lobster sauce had loads of garlic in it, so I was happy with my burger, not the best burger I've ever had but pretty good tho!",

They don't have a menu, but rather they just have three dishes, an entire lobster, burger and something in between which is lobster roll. I tried all of them many time and my favorite is lobster roll, just because you don't need to get messy eating the entire lobster. Burger is good too, but for that price I think there are better ones (very nearby). Also great cocktails and drinks at a very reasonable price.",

    "text": "The world's simplest menu comes to London. You want food? \u00a320, sir! Would you like an overpriced burger, an inexpensive lobster or an equally inexpensive lobster roll? The answer is yes. I would like all of the above. The burger is a pretty standard burger. It's really nothing special. It's not bad but it's not the star of the show here (it feels like blasphemy to talk of a burger like that. Shame on me)You get a decent sized lobster, it's cooked well and the garlic butter just makes it extra beautiful. However, in my opinion, the lobster roll is the main event here and it gets all of the stars. As delicious as lobster is, do you ever get frustrated with trying to pry out all the meat? It's just so tiresome (does this sound like an infomercial yet?). The roll has all of the meat with none of the hassle. And it comes in this gorgeous brioche bun and it's amazing and I wish I had it all the timetl;dr Stop reading this and eat a lobster roll",

You may need to wait 45 to one hours ( no phone call reservation, but walk in to register in waiting list). But from order to serve only take 10 minutes. 10 branches; excellent food, not too many other ingredients, but the fresh lobster ( I ate grilled one). It definitely worth to wait. They call your mobile phone when seat almost ready, even with international number. Amazing food with material itself and cock in right and simple way.",

However, I have tried both their whole lobster and their burger and seen the lobster roll and not been particularly impressed.The burger is filling but very standard as if you could get the same from a barbecue party. The whole lobster was again satisfying but to me does not seem that special; perhaps this is because I come from a Chinese background and we are accustomed to having well cooked lobster anyway. The whole lobster was the right size for one person to eat but with this type of lobster there is not much chunky meat and it does not have much natural flavour; the only thing that gives it flavour in their dish is the sauce that comes with it. I had the garlic sauce which \u00a0frankly along with their chips is far too salty. The only commendable aspect of Burger and Lobster that I have found is that their service is good and their cocktails are rather nice and refreshing which is a welcome relief after their salty food. In short, try Burger and Lobster out if you have a craving for lobster and happen to pass by, but beware there is often a queue and the reward is more for the novelty of consuming lobster than for any other reason.",

Now I have to say I'm not much of seafood person. I eat but I like fillet. I'm terrible when it comes to eating any type of meat that's still on bone/shell. lobster came....... and i did not like it, I did not like the taste and all the effort have to put to eat. I ended up giving it to my friend and I had fries and salad. I understand everyone loves lobster but I guess it's not for me.Now the reason this place gets this stars is not the food but the service. It was terrible, we got charged \u00a38 for service and she did not do anything. She was moody, rude and saw her twice during the time we were there (take order and pay) We were all dissapointed and never coming back here again.",

    "text": "Loved this place, we managed to get a seat straight away at the bar (over an hour if we wanted a table).Service was really quick and being at the bar meant we were constantly topped up with drinks. The iced tea was fantastic.Neither of us tried the burger or the lobster roll, but went for the steamed lobster instead with the garlic butter sauce. It came on a platter, in all it's glory, bigger than I thought it was going to be with a really tasty side salad and fries. It could have been cracked just a little more but it was fun digging into everything.Too full for dessert we were happy with price, food and service. I'll try to go back again to try the other items. We did see a guy getting a burger protein style, i.e. no bun, it gets served under this huge dome of lettuce, it looked really fun!",

    "text": "Don't be dissuaded by the long lines of Asians outside (myself included)-- it is not just a tourist trap. They have three entree options, all 20GBP-- burger, lobster roll, or whole lobster. After some consideration and a quick poll of the bar staff, I chose the whole lobster over the roll. You can have your whole lobster grilled or steamed, I chose grilled as did most others in my line of sight. Alongside the lobster, which they've considerately cracked in strategic places ahead of time, you get a creamy sauce, mixed greens, and fries. The meal itself took a short time to come out and was quite good, definitely worth the price. Make sure to come early (around 5-530) if you don't want to wait for more than 15-20 min for dinner. They take reservations for parties of 6 or more.",

    "text": "Burger. Good. Lobster. GOOOOOOOD (Opt for the garlic butter sauce, it's TO DIE FOR!!).So before I ever stepped foot into B&L, I was briefed on the whole experience. First, there's typically a queue with wait times possibly exceeding an hour+. Second, you have three choices: Burger, Lobster, or Lobster Roll. Third, it's 20 pounds no matter which option you pick. Luckily for me, I came with two friends and we all decided to get one of each and share! B&L even accommodated this by cutting each into three pieces! I enjoyed everything thoroughly... the burger is tasty and the lobster is fresh and delicious. The lobster roll is on the smaller side, but was still amazing. The food was so good, I brought another foodie friend to B&L a few days later. You can also choose a bigger lobster for a lot more $$$ and you can see what they have to offer on the board. I'll also end on the fact that the service was fantastic and the cocktails are strong!",
