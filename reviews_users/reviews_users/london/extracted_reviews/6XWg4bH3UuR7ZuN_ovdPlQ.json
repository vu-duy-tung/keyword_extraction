The decoration and rainforest interior is very realistic and well presented. The food is delicious if you like burgers, chips, hot dogs, nuggets etc. It is a downsized version of the restaurant in Florida, Disneyland, but does the job.",

Before you get to the restaurant you walk through the store selling cuddly toys and then in to the restaurant. There is a bar and chairs for you to sit at which are shaped like animals legs. The restaurant itself is nice and every so often you see the animals move and hear some sound effects. There is a big fish tank. There is a good selection of food on the menu but the price of the food is very high. The toilet facilities are good.",

For something a little different we thought we'd check out the London version. Honestly I was expecting to walk in and find the place filled with kids but strangely enough it was pretty balanced between the kids and the adults (and not in the same party either!) The Rainforest Cafes are pretty similar it seems across the chain - animatronic animals which are fairly realistic and come to life every 15 minutes or so, giant wicked lightening and thunder which also crackles every now and then, rain effects (sound only) and the waterfall type display thing. The only drawback to this atmospheric restaurant is that where we were sitting it was a little noisy and difficult to hear each other. There is a wide range of options on the menu from pasta to grilled dishes to barbecue dishes to salads and sandwiches and burgers. Prices are a little on the expensive side. I think where the restaurant shines is in their cocktails and desserts (actually, the mojo bones are pretty darn good too!) For something a little different check out Rainforest Caf\u00e9 and apparently the R&B club run on Friday and Saturday evenings.",

We were appalled when they arrived and the burgers were actually smaller than a McDonald's Quarter Pounder, and wasn't as nice as the McD's version. Accompanying the burgers, we had a handful of chips each - my husband felt so robbed that he counted the chips on his plate and found he had a grand total of 15. The kids menu included a main course and dessert for \u00a310.90 each. Again, the portions were tiny and their meals didn't even look appetizing. In my opinion they should skip the food, add some activities and just call themselves a theme park.",

However it may be that the novelty of eating in a simulated rainforest environment with stuffed toys watching over you as you eat a burger has grown a bit thin or it may just never have been that cool in the first place, but this place is definitely one for just tourists. If you have small kids then the child friendly ethos will probably suit you down to the ground and you can use the animated background puppetry to your advantage to keep the young ones entertained. However I remember back in the nonwhite when the Rainforest Bar used to be full of twenty-somethings sipping exotic boost cocktails. The food here isn't really worth justifying a visit and the service can be quite frantic. Every ten minutes or so, the lights dim and faux lightning fills the room accompanied by the sound of lightning and elephant noises. As I said above... Great for kids.",

So it was me and 4 children under the age of 12, it was around 4.30pm and I had promised to take them if they were all good (they were all great!). We walked in without making a booking, which was a BIG mistake as the waiting time was about 25 mins. After 20 odd minutes of buying loads of impulsive teddy bears (monkeys, crocs and lots of snakes) we were invited down to the bar area to wait for our table (with 4 kids!!). The service seemed to feel sluggish but the kids were really excited as they thought they were in the depths of the amazon rainforest (great lighting, sounds and mechanical animals).. We were seated near a gorilla which made interesting noises to the amusement of the kids.. After pricey cheeseburgers and milkshakes and lots of photos which weren't that great - I can conclude that the rainforest cafe is something to do once in a lifetime with lots of kids and a big budget!! Oh and make sure you get there early enough to beat the queues (no bookings are made)",

First, the service was weird. The hostess seemed to not understand that we were there to eat. At a restaurant. Crazy, right? Then when my server came around I said I would like to start with a juice--still ordering at this point, then he walked away. Okay. I finished the juice, and we're sitting there, and I finally stopped him and said I was ready. It was like I was speaking a different language, because he didn't understand that I wanted to order lunch. Again. In a restaurant. I got the quesadilla Mexicana and the mac and cheese for my daughter. Yes, dude who didn't wait for me to finish my order twice, she eats people food. That's why. we. are. here. I'm not in the g-damn Rainforest Caf\u00e9 in Piccadilly Circus for MYSELF. So looking around, the other thing that struck me as bizarre was that this is definitely a place to bring kids, but there is a full bar...writing this I guess it makes sense in a way because you would have to be drunk to deal with this mess. My food was...good. I will give it that. I didn't hate it and like that they used the melty Mexican cheese I can never seem to find anywhere. My toddler was all about her mac and cheese. They serve a pretty good portion and it easily can feed an adult. So our waiter finally stops by our table and tries to upsell me on dessert for my child. No. Just the check that I asked for already. Child is getting fussy in her high chair at this point, which wouldn't have been a problem if dude would have hurried up a little. What was good? My daughter's face when she saw her favorite animal, the elephant, come to life. She made a trumpeting sound and they trumpeted and snorted back and she was awed. We also had a grand time checking out the real tropical fish, all the heaps of toys in the gift shop, and coloring on her mat. That made it worth it. Just that. .....I'm pretty sure, looking back, you can get the experience without buying anything if you ask to look around.",

It's really \u00a0cool inside, decorated as a wet, rainy, animal infested rainforest with lots of soft toys around (On the top floor) for the kids. Everyone is friendly, although some people were standing around on their phones. There is a restaurant downstairs with a little bar on the side, which you can order from and have it delivered to your table. I can understand how the provided Sound Effects could get maybe a tad annoying, but overall it's a cool themed little place. But I do agree with people above, this place is mainly meant for kids. Or if you are like me, big kids.",

I went there with some family, including two little children, as it was recommended in some London guide as a place to go with kids. To cut it short: I didn't like it. You pay a lot for average food and you have to suffer an annoying soundscape throughout your visit. Some might like the sound and visual effects, animals, rain, thunder, all that. I found it mainly too loud. Some children were also slightly scared by the blatant sound effects. If you're not happy to pay a lot for a noisy environment, I would not recommend going there. You could get much better food for the same price without irritating noises around you.",

I'd been telling him about this magical restaurant for years. You can imagine his disappointment when he saw the reality. It's full of screaming children for one - that's not a big deal. I can handle that. I can also handle the plastic moving animals and noises that make the restaurant so charming to kids. These aspects I used to love. What I can't handle is the prices. The food is incredibly overpriced, and it's terrible. I know you're paying for the experience, and if that lights up a 5 year olds face, that's great, but they could at least make decent food to go with it rather than what tasted like reheated microwave food that's been slapped on a plate. The food comes out fast. Too fast. That's how you know they're literally just reheating stuff back there. The service was fine and the smoothies were good.... I just feel this place is far too overpriced for such awful food. For what we paid here we could have had a decent meal in a really nice restaurant. A shame really.",

The Rainforest Cafe always came across as a bit of a tourist trap or a place for kids, and so it was my baby cousin's 1st birthday party which brought me here. The decor was impressive. Lots of butterflies, water features, a couple of animated gorilla's which would go off from time to time and a tank full of exotic fish which acted as a nice disturbance for babies when the \"thunder storm\" effect went off (every 30 mins) which had all the babies in our group bawling their eyes out of fear each time this went off! A bit too loud I think... The food was very average for the prices they were asking, but what was most disappointing was my \u00a315 Caesar salad with breaded shrimp. The dish was essentially a whole head of Cos lettuce chopped into quarters, with the leaves all still in tact to the bulb! Crutons sprinkled on top were blocks of bread which were as tough as rocks. Definitely wouldn't recommend eating here, nor bringing kids for 1st birthday parties...If you want a real jungle or animal experience, you're probably better off going to London Zoo. It would be much cheaper too! Good chocolate cake thrown in for birthday parties though!",

My waiting staff have always been really attentive and the food is pretty yummy. Last night I hosted an event with a couple of other bloggers on the Rainforest floor. It's a great space and the staff were on hand the whole evening to bring cocktails (zingy orange ones), grub and sort the music. Food was good with a selection of tasty prawns and chicken on skewers. Only thing that let them down was having the music stopped and lights turned on half an hour before the party was due to end. It was a week night, but even so the space had been paid for so it was a little disappointing to be kicked out early.",

It is full of colours, has sounds of the jungle and just has a pleasant atmosphere. It reminds me so much of Disney land, everything is done very well. If I was taken to the Rainforest Caf\u00e9 as a kid, I would have had to be dragged out from there.We sat and ate, the food got to the table nice and quick, which I never like, but it was warm and tasted good, I had a massive juicy burger, the kids portions are massive, and would have done me ok.There is also a shop upstairs where the kids can play about in, and buy some teddy animals, but it was packed and chose to carry on eating, but ended up leaving the place with a \u00a35 key ring which I didn't put on my keys and have no idea where it is.One other thing, this is actually a club too, and thinking about it now, I cant believe that I haven't been here yet, its been around for years and my mates have always spoken about going but never have... may do soon.",

You enter through a store full of animal cuddly toys and head to the back and downstairs to get to the restaurant. We booked but although that does mean you will get a table you still have to wait around 15 mins (please note that this was in August so was very busy) We waited at the bar for our table and when we were taken to our table we sat just over from a massive aquarium and underneath a cheetah and opposite a gorilla!! Amidst the rain, thunder and lightening! It is a wonderful family setting and for this alone I am giving it 5 stars! The food was OK - good, it was not wonderful but we were all pleased with out meals and the price was good. They did have lots to choose from and prices were around \u00a315 for adults. As I said kids were free so did not really notice how much they were! Our waiter was lovely and friendly but as it was so very busy we waited longer than we would have liked for drinks, food and the bill. It was a wonderful family place and one I will go to again on my next family visit to London, the only advise I would give is book and that younger children/toddlers might find the noise a bit frightening as we did see 3 toddlers getting very upset in there!",

Well you might as well be as it's the Rainforest cafe! This place is awesome and not just for kids. I've wanted to come here for ages and I'm so glad that I did. Looking around the underground beauty it's hard not to be in awe of this replica rainforest - the starlit sky, elephants, gorillas, lizards, butterflies, birds and the sounds of the animals make you feel like you've stumbled across a secret rainforest (in the middle of the West End). There is even a tropical fish tank! How they managed to fit so many things in this space is beyond me. I came here for cocktails and drinks at the bar and there is nothing more surreal than supping on a strawberry daiquiri under the canopy of a giant mushroom, while also experiencing a \"thunder storm\" (brilliant life-like sounds of thunder and lightning effects too). The cocktails were pretty tasty and the bar staff were super friendly. The bar stools are really funky and cute too (they looked like legs of animals - zebras, leopards, giraffes and many more). If you want to experience something different and feel like you've been \u00a0transported to a magical rainforest I recommend coming here. It's fun, lively, exciting and surreal. \u00a0I think it would be really cool to eat in the restaurant too, as you'll be surrounded by the rainforest atmosphere.",

    "text": "Went to the Rainforest Cafe for a family dinner after a show. The concept arguably is brilliant and kids are sure to love it - particularly the moving animal props. The menu has the standard American fare and here are a \u00a0selection of drinks as well. I found the drinks are \u00a0pricey with \u00a35.50 for a 300ml Budweiser and \u00a310-\u00a315 for a pretty ordinary cocktail particularly for the kind of restaurant.Food wise , again I found it pretty ordinary and extremely pricey with Entrees around \u00a320 each and kids menu starting at \u00a312.50. We opted for the Kids Adventure Menu which comes with an activity pack and option to choose 2 sides. My elder one had a baked Potato which came with a small tub of butter and a small bowl \u00a0of salad. The little one had chicken nuggets (around 4-5 pieces) which is sufficient for a child but not worth the money. The side of Onion rings had only 3-4 .The wife and I \u00a0had two starters - I had Buffalo wings, which were big disappointment, this came with a blue cheese dip and Jungle wrap, essentially Tortilla with lots of coleslaw. It was very filling but didn't standout in anyway.We were still waiting for the mains and realised we were pretty full so decided to cancel it, the waiter was helpful and went off to check. He came after some time with our plates mains! I am pretty sure that the food was not plated when we asked to cancel but even talking to the manager didn't help. All they did was to organise two takeaway boxes which you need to pack yourself! We were asked to collect bags for the boxes ourselves and all these from my perspective was poor customer service. I was tempted to take off the 'discretionary' service charge but my wife talked me out of it.The bill came to \u00a3133 for two rounds of drinks for two kids and two adults and the food. Overall feeling - should have gone elsewhere where we would \u00a0have got a bigger bang for the buck. On the plus side, it is an unique restaurant and environment that the kids are bound to enjoy. We however will not be going back!Update : just had the mains we took away. The Wiki wiki Stir fry with chicken and the Aztec Chicken were not bad.",

It really hardly ever is at any of the rainforest cafes. We basically go for the ambiance but this was what was extremely disappointing. None of the animals moved when it was time to. We heard all of the sounds but no movement or light show going on at all. Was a disappointing first time for my one year old but thankfully she won't remember it and we have a chance to do it again somewhere different.",

I didn't come here on my own and sit my grown-up ass to gaze at plastic gorillas while I eat.My niece indeed, loved it here and the little princess was distracted enough to let me and my brother to have a decent talk. Food rate: 2/5. The kid's menu had a big diversity, but Kaitlyn wanted to eat pizza. She ended up eating half a slice and said it tasted like her puppy's biscuits. \u00a0I went for a Rainforest steak burger which disappointed me so much. It looked great before actually getting to taste it. The meat was dry and tasteless. Well, it did have a taste -- raw and disgusting. They should have named it Dry-forest burger. What's not so cool: I find the pricing too high for the quality of the food. Staring at some fake animals won't fill me up.Also: If you're not a kids type of person, avoid this place avoid at all costs! There are plenty of mini persons running and screaming around.What's cool, though: They actually managed to make the interior look pretty realistic for a cafe. Sometimes the staff gets dressed up as animals and it's funny to watch a middle age guy in a neon green frog costume, jumping around children.",

Snickering under their breath as they muttered silly nothing under their breaths. The two men behind the bar were rude to me and my group of 10 people. They treated us like garbage. In my country it makes sense to be very nice or pretend to be at least to make a tip. I was there for under 30 minutes because what the staff also slacked to tell me was that they were about to close. They rushed me to finish my drink and expected me to have left even before then. I appreciate this chain, I go to the location in NY and it is an opposite experience in comparison. I am glad to say i spent so little time there.",

    "text": "It was a childhood dream to actually dine into the Rainforest cafe but sadly the high prices prevented that dream to ever come true then. But because of my boyfriend, he helped me recover that lost dream and took me there. At first it was just a place I wanted to eat for fun and my food expectation were actually very low knowing it was tourist place. When it came to decor and atmosphere I was completely wowed. The whole place was recreated into a tropical forest with great attention to detail too. There was even a dome with a view of the starry night sky, a fish tank with tropical fishes, moving gorillas making sounds every now and then and elephants that flapped their ears. Although I understand it is not for everyone I really enjoyed the sound effects such as the sound of thunder. It brought our meal to life and opened up our other senses.As romantic the place looked with dangling plants and flowers, dim lighting it is not a place for a first date or a very romantic dinner due to the amount of lively excited children running round. It didn't bother us though and we felt part of something bigger when all the staff stood up to sing happy birthday with a volcanic cake for their birthdays. The menu had most of the classic American dishes and we decided to start our meal off with buffalo chicken wings. I was very surprised at the quality of these wings. As synthetic the sauce was they \u00a0tasted fine and kind of how we expected them to be, they were also very well fried, plump and meaty with a lovely crispy skin on top. They were very mild and tasted even better dipped into the creamy light \u00a0blue cheese sauce that came with it.For mains I gambled with the pork baby back ribs. The reason I said so is because I've had many where it is just drenched in a sickly sauce and cooked so much it loses all its natural flavours and texture but I actually really enjoyed these. Although there wasn't much heat the cajun spices flavoured the meat really well, giving different notes of flavour by the paprika, garlic and pepper. The BBQ sauce was nice and light and only to cover the meat and added a good gentle sweetness to it. It was tender and packed full of its juices and yet still had a good meaty texture to it. For the side I chose a baked potato with sour cream and chive and it came in generous size. The flesh was fluffy and soft and creamed well with the sour cream. It also came with a corn on the cob and slices of watermelon which felt out of place. They were both pretty bland but probably because they were not in season.My boyfriend went for the Primal Steak and that is where we felt the quality go down. The steak was tough and chewy even when it came medium rare as requested. For the price it was a huge disappointment. Chips were very average but it wasn't like ketchup couldn't save them. I was happy I chose the ribs. Overall it was a great experience and I still agree it's a place you go more for the decor and than the food as for the same price there are many places that does it better. However it is also a place I wish everyone could go at least once if you're into themed restaurant as it is worth experiencing just once. It definitely brings out the child inside of you. Service was great, greeted at the door with a 'passport' with your name where you hand over to the staff downstairs to get your entry. It's like you're really leaving London...haha! Food came relatively quick and all done with a smile. Definitely a place I plan to return to.",

We waited almost an hour for food, which was better than I thought it would be - I had the chicken sandwich. Very limited menu, hardly any choices on it which seems ridiculous for a chain. We were also charged a service fee which was not deserved, ended up asking to have it taken off the bill which the waiter begrudgingly agreed to after a long wait to \"check with his manager.\" I'd rather go to TGI Friday's if I'm looking for a chain in the area, and I hate that place. I guess the good part is that my niece was entertained throughout, but it is not an enjoyable experience when other families are letting their kids run wild all over the place.",
