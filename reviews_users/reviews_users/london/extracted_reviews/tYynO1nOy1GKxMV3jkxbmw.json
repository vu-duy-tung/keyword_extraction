The queues... yes the queues. The one thing that annoys me about TBT is their no-reservation policy... I feel like a bit of a dweeb queueing up first thing in the morning for a Full English.. but nowhere's perfect. Anyways, the queue was not too bad for us and we were quickly seated in the kitsch restaurant.TBT's food is just gorgeous. Big portions, not too wildly priced and super-friendly super-hipster staff that always have a smile on their faces. Their coffee is delicious too, or they know how to make a proper brew if you're so inclined.Despite the prospect of queuing, I'll definitely be back.",

There must be some day that you sleep through the day wake up then heading to town and feel like have English/American breakfast and you couldn't find a place that do all day breakfast!! And now this is the place!! But please take note breakfast serve up to 5pm only but there are still good choice of other breakfast like food in the menu.Have been heard a lot about this place and always wanted to come but never find a good timing to come. There are 3 of us including my little nephew. My nephew loving his Hot chocolate with mash mellow in the pac man mug I had Potato with rosemary and Pancake with bacon which really enjoyed it a lot. The place is a big small so you need to find your way t squeeze it through table and seat. Overall we had a lovely breakfast time !!",

Their \"cooker\" apparently was broken so after waiting in line for 15 minutes we were told it would take two hours. So we went to the British museum and then came back mid morning. We proceeded to wait in line for an hour. When we got our food it was fine but nothing special. It was a good presentation, but the actual food was a huge disappointment. Not worth the wait. Without a line it might be worth it.",

Either way like the East London branch they comped our meal on the house so they get some stars back. Who doesn't like a free meal, I'm not the judges from Masterchef keeping an eye on the clock or details.All in all it's nice. Real nice but nothing too special.

After I finished the paper I had about 20 minutes left to wait long, of all the people that were waiting inline only one couple ended up giving up. \u00a0 I ended up going for the full Monty and fresh apple juice for breakfast which was quickly served. The bacon was simple amazing and the bread was good bit could have been a bit larger so it could fit the whole egg. I would recommend coming here for breakfast if you have time and just plan for a 45-90 minute wait but the food is worth it",

It's a retro style caf\u00e9 so I love the interior as much as the food as it has a very welcoming feel to it, where you can just chow down and lament over the night before. The staff seem to have an understanding that you NEED your food swiftly and with minimal fuss, because if you don't get it asap you might just die (or at least something horrible is going to happen inside you due to the cocktails, sambuca shots and er what was the rest that you drank the night before?) They're very fun and friendly. As soon as the food arrives a silence of at least 10 minutes ensues as everyone's thinking what a little lifesaver the BC is. Their food is on the calorific side, so dieters beware, but it's so, so good. Their hearty bacon and sausages are bound to please the carnivorous of the bunch and the doorstep thick toast soaked in butter is heaven. Even better dipped in the boiled eggs that they manage to cook perfectly every time. (Thank God, as a too runny egg might just mean game over for the most queasy hangover victim.)Don't you dare order the Special K!",

They've got good coffee, tasty smoothies, delicious sandwiches, and all kinds of fill-your-belly-to-the-max ginormous breakfast dishes, as befitting a spot named after the most important meal of the day.However, the best part about this place by far is the suuuuuper nice and friendly people who work there. If you ever find yourself in the situation of eating and using the free wi-fi in a bright orange jumpsuit, you might find yourself chatting with the fun people behind the counter who will then offer to join in your high-tech scavenger hunt adventure game. They might even give out passwords in return for getting serenaded by Beatles songs, which is a true sign of a fantastic and outgoing cafe staff that I'd like to hang out with. Espeecially you with the moustache.I'll happily kick it in the Breakfast Club any day. Good food and good company = 4 solid stars from me!",

    "text": "The Breakfast Club is more about being brilliantly and kitsch-tastically nostalgic for the '80s than it is about getting a good hearty breakfast in you. The decor, the ambiance and the 'vibe' (yeah, I hate that saying too) are all spot on; from the comedy blackboard outside spouting breakfast-relevant witticisms to the Happy Meal toys from your childhood and the photos of brat pack flicks on the walls, it's a nice place to discover. Portions are sizable and the menu features all the staple breakfast items you'd hope for; but the food is reasonably greasy and in some cases a little on the bland side. Oh, and if you're not a fan of grimeyness then I'd steer clear. I can imagine clean-freaks would get the urge to don the marigolds and give the whole place a good scrub. It's a tiny little cafe so there aren't that many seats, and it can get freakishly warm and smell a bit like toilets if you sit right in the back. But it's a fun place to visit occasionally, especially when you're in the mood for a good old fry up.",

How inconvenient that no matter what time of the morning you turn up, there's a queue minimum wait time of 20-30 mins long. In this circumstance we waited almost over an hour. It didn't seem right to give up halfway, might as well wait for the novelty of it, standing in the freezing cold, the threat of rain upon us anytime.After finally being seated in the \"downstairs\" area, which is very tightly packed, you were almost rubbing elbows with other patrons. Not a concept I am fond of. We ordered orange juice for drinks. For food, we ordered the half monty (bacon, sausage, eggs, beans, grilled tomato & toasted multigrain bloomer), pancakes & berries with maple syrup & vanilla cream, huevos al benny (poached eggs, chorizo, roasted peppers, avocado, fresh chillies & hollandaise) and porridge served with home-made spiced plum & apple compote with toasted almonds. All our dishes were very delicious and very filling. Slight criticism on the pancakes which were very dry and not enough maple syrup, also the huevos al benny english muffin was thin and almost overwhelmed by the toppings. My partner commented the al benny was nicely spicy but he's had better benedicts elsewhere. I really enjoyed the music they played on this occasion, nice ambiance added to the experience. Almost to help you forget the line waiting. I would recommend this place to people without mentioning the queue to test their conviction. But every once in a while it'd be worth waiting to come here, at least I'm glad we've done it once.",

One good thing was that the host would come out every 15 mins to tell you the updated estimated waiting time.",

There's always a queue here but we were lucky and only had to wait around 20 minutes for a table...happy days! The decor is cool with a funky 80's vibe. The staff are all really friendly and there's a really relaxed atmosphere in the place, even though there was a crowd of people waiting outside we didn't feel rushed at all!I opted for the pancakes with berries, vanilla cream and maple syrup and they were honestly the best pancakes I've ever had. The portion size was ginormous and I couldn't finish them but I really really wanted to. My brother got the 'All American' which consisted of pancakes with crispy bacon, sausage, eggs, fried potatoes and a side of maple syrup. He was equally happy with his choice and we barely spoke a word to each other for the whole time we were there...always a good sign!I can't recommend this place enough: If in London, go to The Breakfast Club!",

New Year's Day I waited in the cold for about 45 minutes to an hour outside for this. I started at about the sushi store down the street and slowly, very slowly worked my way towards the front. The storefront is super cute and yellow. It pops unlike the other locations.I had the eggs benedict and the all American breakfast. I've had better eggs benny, so I'd pass up on this. The sausage that comes with the all American is AMAZING. REALLY GOOD. I still salivate when I think about it. Bacon and potatoes could have been crispier. The pancakes were fluffy and moist! The syrup on it complimented it well.Overall, it was good. But I'm not sure if I would wait for it again. Hmm... Debatable.",

I'm a firm member of the 'brunch' club so I thought this would suit me down to ground, which it kinda did and didn't at the same time.I decided to go for a hot chocolate and the American breakfast, although I was eyeing up the Eggs Benedict (but I had to go back to work, and most def would have been starving within an hour or so). At the time I went, it wasn't too busy maybe 10 people max, but it seemed to be too much for the waitress to handle! She had me waiting for almost 15 mins (did I mention that I was on my lunch break), I was a bit miffed, but shrugged it off. Although it had calmed when she took my order, it still had taken her two attempts before my order stuck in her head!! Down to the food, the pancakes were good, very big (smiles) and tasty too. The scrambled eggs were nice too (minus the herb garnish) it wasn't really needed, but the bacon was very fatty and just not really nice. It was cold and didn't look very \u00a0edible, still I ate (no wasting here). The hot chocolate brought memories of my uni days when my flatmate used to put marshmallows in for me (great touch), I enjoyed this a lot! So much so, that I finished it before my food arrived!All in all, it's fine for a quick nibble, but I'll still continue my search for the bee knees in brunch-ery (that should be a real word)! ^_^",

Finally made it in after waiting outside in the rain for 10 minutes on a Thursday and got a seat.Super cute ambiance and atmosphere - it's small (hence the long lines outside). As for the food - I don't think I'll go back though. It felt as if they were \"trying\" to do a traditional American breakfast, but just failed. The dishes were pretty bland - small, tough pancakes (not light and fluffy), overcooked bacon and a sausage that was inedible. I had a breakfast smoothie (strawberry-banana-oats-yogurt) and this was the one saving grace. I'm glad I ordered it.However, I will say this. If I was nursing a hangover - and still a bit drunk - this is perfect greasy-fill-you-up-carb food. Also, I'm told the other locations are a bit better... Maybe I'll try them one day.",

Most of the tables have seats enough to accommodate groups of four, but my sister and I, our two heaping plates of food, and our milkshakes cramped our table. We ordered one sweet and one savory dish and split them between us: the chorizo hash and the apple cinnamon french toast. Both were delicious, satisfying, and, as I just said, enormous portions. Fun fact: chorizo dipped in maple syrup is DELICIOUS. Our milkshakes (strawberry and vanilla) were good but not as sweet as we're used to (admittedly, as Americans). The prices were reasonable, especially considering the portion sizes. The waitstaff were also tremendously friendly and brought us a pitcher of tapwater right from the start, so we wouldn't have to keep bugging them for refills. Final thought: the only thing that kept me from thinking this place wasn't transplanted from the LES in NY is its lack of bottomless mimosas.",

Staff have always been friendly to me and I've never complained about my food.I've had and heard good things about: Full Monty, Hot Pastrami Sandwich, All American Pancakes, Sausage and Egg Butty, Huevos Al Benny (soooo good) and the best freshly squeezed apple juice I've ever had. It just seems like a solid choice for brunch enthusiasts, maybe not the most adventurous menu but come here for very good, filling food and a good atmosphere.",

    "text": "If I'd written this review 2 years ago, I would have rated The Breakfast Club 4 or even 4 1/2 stars but based on my last couple of visits I now can only give it a 3 which is a shame. I fear that the eatery, at least the Soho branch, may have become a victim of its own success thanks to a lot of good word of mouth - which I have provided - and press from reviewers like Time Out and Yelp itself. The food itself is fantastic - full of a wide variety, delicious and extremely filling, even if I have it for breakfast, I can still be full up by late afternoon! Their fry ups, pancakes, smoothies and milkshakes, particularly the Elvis, are simply divine! However what has disappointed me over the last couple of visits is the queuing, seating / lack of and poor service - sometimes resulting in receiving incorrect orders and once my order had to be returned and my friend had practically finished theirs by the time my correct order came out! It was kind of embarrassing as I'd really bigged up the place too so I'm sure my friend thought I was full of rubbish then after such a recommendation!I hope The Breakfast Club improves on the things that I and others have marked it down for and it is ultimately a great place!",

When we arrived, there were about 18 people in front of us. We waited about 30-45 minutes. We were also a group of 18. We were split up into 2 tables which was fine. As other reviewers suggested, the place is unique. They don't use typical tables and seats at all areas of the restaurant. Most of the group either had the Eggs Benedict, American Breakfast or the Full Monty (British Breakfast). All were wonderful and tasty. Good portion sizes suitable for sharing especially when we wanted to sample other foods later in the day. Suggestions: For kids, order side (eggs, bacon, etc.)Try their juices (apple, orange, virgin mojito). Their juices are made to order.",

    "text": "After a morning of careful research on the best breakfast spot in town, I finally narrowed my choice down to 'The Breakfast Club'. \u00a0For starters, how could one go wrong with a place that's solely dedicated to making the most important meal of the day? \u00a0Upon arrival, I was immediately taken back to the \"too cool for school\" breakfast/brunch spots in New York and San Francisco. \u00a0Although these normally annoy the shit out of me, I was quite pleased to see a place like this in London. \u00a0Hip, busy as hell, and nearly impossible to get a seat. \u00a0Fearing the worst, we almost turned around and headed back to the always reliable Balans Cafe...however I couldn't stop staring at the eggs benedict and other delicious dishes that were being served. \u00a0Within 15 minutes we magically found ourselves at a table, practically rubbing elbows with the people right beside us.The decor of this place leaves a little bit to be desired. \u00a0I typically take photos of most places, however from every angle, it just didn't look great. \u00a0I decided to skip the photos and focus on the food. \u00a0I guess one could say it's cute. Let's just say I prefer modern over hip and kitch.The menu was hands down one of the most complete I've ever seen in London in terms of breakfast. \u00a0Spicy chorizo, full American breakfast with maple syrup, streaky (real) bacon, English breafkast, eggs benedict, breakfast burrito, etc. \u00a0I honestly felt like I had entered a portal that mysteriously placed me on the other side of the pond. \u00a0Being a true yankee that has no qualms with scarfing down a 1000+ calorie meal before noon, I opted for the full American Breakfast: \u00a0Two eggs scrambled, streaky bacon, potatoes, pancakes with maple syrup, toast and sausage. The food came out faster than I expected, almost freakishly fast. \u00a0I foolishly thought that I'd succeed in smashing every last bite, but I was clearly wrong. \u00a0That breakfast made the most of me. \u00a0In flavor, I'd give it an A. \u00a0It's really really hard to screw up breakfast food and let's face it... it's not world class cuisine \u00a0I'd give it an A++ for portion size, food delivery time and service. \u00a0I've actually had a tastier breakfast at Balans, but I'll keep coming back to the Breakfast Club to try everything on it's extensive menu until my belly can't handle any more... or at least until I get tired of waiting in line 20 minutes for pancakes that I probably could easily make at home in the comfort of my own kitchen.",

I'd heard so many great things about it, so I arranged to meet with a group of friends there for brunch but ended up having to eat somewhere else the line was so long! It is definitely not one of those under-wraps restaurants. It's good, and everyone knows it. Don't expect the creme de la creme of swankiness when you walk in. It's a divey, hipster, warm place. Not meant for the faint of heart when they see a sticky spot on the table.Of the 2 times I actually ate there, a wait was necessary. Once was around dinner so it wasn't too bad, but the time I went for brunch (knowing about the lines) we all had to wait about 30 minutes. Turnover isn't fast here, so you'll have to slowly wait for your breakfast. The staff there is always nice, playful, and helpful if you have problems with being indecisive like me. The time I went with a big group of friends, we were all starving. After looking over the extensive menu, we decided to order a bunch of sides in order to get variety. I ordered french toast, eggs, bacon, and potatoes. All for \u00a37! It was incredible. The waiter brought me my plate that was filled to the brim. 4 pieces of french toast, scrambled eggs, crispy bacon, and delicious potatoes. I was in heaven, and so was my wallet. I would come here again and again, but the line is so restricting!",

The only saving grace of the food here is that the sheer quantity of it beats your stomach into a stupor from which it doesn't recover until well past lunchtime. The last meal I ate here (an eggs Florentine) was substandard to be kind. There was nothing to set it apart, the spinach wasn't properly drained making the muffin soggy, and the muffin was under-toasted. I've had a better Florentine in a Wetherspoon. Same about the breakfast burritos: Overcooked, dry, crumbly chorizo at an eye-watering price. The one saving grace was the tea (mint) , which was made with fresh leaves and pretty nice, I gotta say. \u00a0 Face it: the food here is frankly average and overpriced.\"But the atmosphere?\"Oh, yes, let's talk about the atmosphere. The 'quaint', 'retro' interior is neither quaint nor retro. It's dirty, under-maintained and rickety. Every single piece of furniture wobbles like a drunkard and feels like it's passed through twelve different schools before winding up in this place.Finally, and this is really the nail in the coffin, you have to queue to get in. Unless you come at particularly unsociable hours, you're looking at around a 20-60 minute wait. Since when was it cool to crowd outside on a rainy day waiting for BACON? Bacon is more important than this, people. There are countless other places in Soho that do a respectable breakfast. The Star Cafe, for example, or even Bruno's.Please. There are better ways to spend your time than queuing outside this place. Do it for all of us.",

I recommend coming right at 9 on Sunday, because we waited for almost one and a half hours. The staff was great: they came out every 20 minutes to inform us about the waiting time and they handed out smoothie samples.We ended up sharing a table with another couple. We could have said no, but we didn't really mind. We ordered the full Monty (English breakfast) and the American Breakfast. It was a lot for a great price. I can imagine that the American breakfast wouldn't really impress Americans, but it was still a lot and good!We didn't feel rushed at all, even with the long line outside and I can definitely recommend their delicious hot chocolate with marshmallows!",

The atmosphere was so chic and there was a bit of a wait. But in SoHo we were entertained. We had no room for anything else. So we were more than satisfied. The English breakfast is popular but people who ordered other dishes such as the pancake and the poached eggs were cleaning their plates . I plan to go back and order something else! Good eats!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went there before going to the British museum on a Thursday morning at 10:20, and waited for at least half an hour outside in the cold weather. The waitress told us the back seating area is closed because of something is broken, and kindly offered us hot chocolate in sample cups, which was really nice. However, when we got to the front of the queue we saw from the window that they were quite inefficient with placing people at the tables - a waiter was just standing there texting on his phone doing nothing, and they needed to talk a lot before assigning tables.For the meal we ordered coffee, full Monty and egg Benedict. I have to say that we were VERY disappointed with the food. First of all my full Monty was LUKEWARM - nothing on the plate was fresh out of the kitchen hot, as if it was reheated badly in a microwave. The bacon and toast were over cooked and the beans were too sweet. Nothing else was as good as I expected and the food being cold made it worse. The egg Benedict did not have the classic hollandaise sauce on top of it. The ham was bland, and the English muffin was not soft inside.In conclusion the food at this place is below the average brunch place I've been too, so I really don't understand all the hype against it. I would probably consider it if there is no line and I just need to fill myself with something, but with the 40 minute wait it is definitely NOT worth it.",

    "text": "In comparison to the clapham one I'd say this is relatively disappointing. It's small which is no problem and the decor is basically the same but sitting down near the speakers was definitely a mistake since all they seemed to play was chart music dating from 2006-2014. Even after we moved it was obnoxiously loud and listening to \"yes I like it\" while I ate my food put me off it. Shares a playlist with Asda apparently. Service was strange, the service charge policy is loose and I think that makes the waiters behave in maybe a bit of a too intimate way. The waiter pulled up a chair and scooched as if he was eating with us while taking our order and that put us both on edge cos it made it feel like there was a lot of pressure.I see the appeal without a doubt, the food is definitely worth going for and arrives quickly. I had the chicken and waffles while my boyfriend had the Mr. Big Chicken and they were both really good. I just think the general atmosphere including the service puts strain on the quality of the food.",

They do really good pancakes; I also tried the avocado on toast (with extra feta) and they were not cheap on the quantities. Really good coffee as well and nice waiters. The queue though is a real problem. I don't mind queuing a bit for a really good place, but Breakfast Club always have that massive queue (literrally going round the corner of the street) no matter which time of the day it is.They are equally good breakfast place around where you won't need to queue.",

    "text": "Can you choose a place to eat just based on the name? You sure can! (Sometimes, it works out!)We walked inside and it totally reminded me of our quirky diners at home. Happy 80s and 90s music played ranging from hip-hop to top 40. Our waiter (on wheeled shoes!) was awesome (more on him later.) Let's talk about the breakfast:Reggie Veggie: Two eggs any way you like (poached por moi), potatoes, mushrooms, \u00a0roasted tomato, bread, veggie sausage--and the curious beans. The veggie sausage was weird; kind of like a doughy fried stick. Not my favorite thing, but I did like everything else. Well, almost. Beans. Beans, guys? Van De Kamp beans for breakfast? I know that it's a traditional breakfast item here..on the bright side, my passing on them just means more for everybody else :)I can't remember the name of what my guy ordered, but I have a pic of it: eggs, sausages, mushrooms, bread, and peppers PLUS huge delicious chunks of feta. That was some darn good feta. Once we finished, we walked outside and saw that the queue was down the block. Wow, we made it just in time. Oh, the waiter. Imagine it's approximately 14 hours later, around 1am. You're walking to your ridiculously late meal at the Duck and Waffle and see a guy gliding down the street. It's our waiter from Breakfast Club and I swear, as we passed each other, we all did the, 'How do I know them?' I mean in a city with over 8 million people, of course we would run into the same person we just met that day in Soho in the Financial district.",

As such, I had the All American breakfast, which came complete with eggs, bacon, sausage, hash browns (which are really home fries) and of course, pancakes with maple syrup. The pancakes hit the spot, but I was hoping they'd be fluffier. And the bacon was not as greasy and delicious as it should've been (considering it's an American plate!). All in all though, it was a great meal, huge portion and delicious. Contrary to other comments about the service, I thought it was actually not bad considering how busy it was. The queue is long (for us, about 45 min, table of 6), but that was expected.",

It wasn't that great, but maybe all of the hip stuff on the walls and the name put my expectations too high.Went there on a random Tuesday for lunch and was promptly seated. I had the All American breakfast and my breakfast-mate had The Full Monty. Food was eh, just okay. I've had much better in London pubs and ghetto diners in the States. My bacon was just like the bacon in any pub breakfast or Tesco, the sausage was okay and the eggs fine. But, it was the small things that made me not enjoy my breakfast.-the pancakes were NOT great. I like them light and fluffy, but these turned into a doughy blob once you start chewing on them - not a nice feeling in your mouth.-I had a piece of toast from the Full Monty and it wasn't even toast. Just soft white bread with some light press/grill marks. Also, the tomato seemed to be thrown on the grill for like 8 seconds b/c it was still like a regular raw tomato with some sear marks on it..wtheck?-food took about 30 minutes to arrive, which was strange as the place was about only slightly more than half full. But, didn't mind too muchMaybe I'm being too picky, but these are small things that don't need to happen.On the bright side, the coffee was good, juices looked great and the place is cute. It wasn't bad enough for me to not give it a second shot, but it's definitely not 4 stars.",

Since moving permanently to the big smoke it's become one of my most regular haunts not to mention winning the hearts of everyone I've ever taken there, meat eater and veggie alike. My personal fave food-wise is the 'All American' - sausage, eggs, bacon, mushrooms, pancakes and maple syrup.I've tried tons of other breakfast/brunch joints, some have been good with great food or a really nice environment but none have had the same great mix of relaxed shabby chic atmosphere, tasty salads or great greasy food {depending on what the doctor requires that day!} and amazing not to mention funnily named smoothies that are worth the trip alone! ('Blue Monday' or 'Mango A-Go-Go' anyone?). The Breakfast Club is the perfect place for the weekend hangover cure, a catch up with friends or a very informal work meeting (During the week their big table at the front is often taken over by the local media crowd for their informal brunch brainstorms).The only downside is that it's small... that's part of the charm too but you might not always get in. Big groups (4+) might have a bit of a problem if the table at the front is taken but otherwise it's perfect. It's worth any wait though!",

I am starting to believe their long queues are just a result of a lot of hype. The portion sizes are big. However, the berries aren't very fresh and the pancakes were not served hot but slightly soggy. The milkshakes are OK. Nothing was terrible, but nothing was particularly great either. There are definitely much nicer brunch places in London with better atmosphere and prices.",

You can actually taste a variety of breakfast depending on your mood of the day.The service was good. Love the maple syrups.Food wise.. too many choices! And unfortunately everything taste as good! I dont eat pork but the vege version of full monty was soooooooo goood! If you are a vegetarian worth the try. The vege sausages is so juicy and fluffy that it taste like real meat.I have yet to try everything on the menu but Very Berry pancakes and cinnamon apple french toast are my top favourites! I cant help myself each time i walk in the breakfast club not to order them!The only downside is that you have to wait at least 1 hour in the queue to get in! Ridiculous right? But wait.. they do take care of you while you wait. I had wonderful hot choco with marsmallow the other day. I love being taken care!Always bring friends with you because good things are meant to be shared!",

I got the All American, which consisted of 2 pancakes with maple syrup, 2 eggs, bacon, a sausage, and homefries. A lot of food for sure haha! Also got some bread on the side to go with my poached eggs.The consistency of the pabcakes was peeerrrrrfeeecct! And the homefries weren't overly greasy which is always a good thing. Im usually not a fan of bacon, but they cooked it just right here, not too crispy, and bot too chewy...yuk! It's a little tight in terma of space, but the decor is really cute, and they've got some vintage looking furniture. Staff was friendly, and service was very quick!If I ever come back to London, I will most definitely stop by the breakfast club at least once. And for those of you travelling to London, please, treat yourself to a magnificent breakfast here!",

You would never see baked beans on a standard American breakfast. The juices are made fresh which I was pleased to learn. The scene: a line outside trailing into the alleyway. I'd never seen a line like this before out here. The wait was reminiscent of any trendy brunch spots back home. Quite cozy inside, a bit too cozy for us than we would have liked since we were seated at a 4-seater with another couple we did not know. Slightly awkward. Servers were very friendly, 90s music blasting (Ace of Base, Sisqo the Thong Song - which I probably hadn't heard since the 90s) and service was quick and orders were turned around fast. I was there on a Saturday so perhaps the wait is better on a weekday.",

I got The Full Monty with an americano to drink, and it was da bomb. My GF got the sausage butty with egg and an espresso, and she loved it as well.To be honest, we went basically as soon as it opened on a Saturday morning at like 8 am, I didn't know that a queue often forms quickly, but I had no such experience. We walked right in and had a great time. I didn't even know that people complained about that until prepping this review but, again, my experience was nothing but flawless. Would highly recommend to anyone because it was reasonably priced and delicious!",

We were seated immediately and that's were the excitement died. The hygiene here was clearly lacking - same table cloth was used to wipe several tables and just placed on a railing when not in use, the waiter who cleaned the tables used the same unwashed hands to get a pen, take our order, bring our drinks, straws, and napkins all while cleaning other tables with the same cloth in between. Then came the food, the much heard of, highly reviewed Full Monty ...meh, it should be called Full Nonsense. Everything was bland and tasteless ...the eggs, bacon, sausage, mushrooms, potatoes, and even the bread ...how did they mess that up?!? Anyhoo, we were severely disappointed and pissed.

Their queuing system is completely ineffective leading to long waits that could be erased with a more thoughtful process. They don't ask people in line for party size, so they seat the first group at random only to realize that the next group would have been better suited to that table. The group behind waits for half an hour for another table to come available just because they didn't allocate seats right. Turning over tables takes forever. The same person is taking orders, busing tables, seating people, processing payments, and serving. All things that could be done in parallel. \u00a0with more appropriate staffing. I don't mind a wait, but I hate when people waste my time due to poor management. Get it together! But maybe that's just the american capitalist in me that can't wait patiently. oh well",

As expected there was a bit of a line but they came out and gave you an estimated time when you'd most likely be served which for 2 of us was about 20mins (it was really about 10mins)It's a small venue but does the job. There are numerous locations all over London and have the same menu with all the classics and more of an American breakfast feel to the place. I had the Elvis shake which is always a winner if you like peanut butter and banana. The All American breakfast is my go to choice even though they have lots of other options. The All American is eggs (done how you want) sausage, potatoes, bacon on top of pancakes with an ample amount of maple syrup! \u00a0always hits the spot. It's a cool atmosphere and you should definitely check it out. The one downside is it's pretty pricey...my breakfast with a tip was about \u00a318 but it is good food! Enjoy",

We started a few shops down just before the Thai restaurant and it took us an hour and a half to get in! But the wait was so worth it!!I got The Full Monty (\u00a310.90) and tried the English Breakfast Tea (\u00a32.20) for the first time. The Full Monty came with a nice juicy sausage that's easy to cut through, poached eggs (though you can get them scrambled or whatever else you'd like), fried tomato, beans, black pudding (which I later found out to be blood pudding), toast, and my favorite mini potato wedges while the tea came with milk.I'm not a fan of black tea so the milk made the English Breakfast Tea bearable. To each their own?The Full Monty was amazing and exceeded my expectations. The poached eggs were amazing and well prepared, tomato was perfect, potato wedges were off the charts, sausage was just fantastic, and the black pudding tasted like dried meat to me and it didn't bother me that I was eating blood.But the best thing we got to end the meal were berry pancakes (\u00a39). Sweet and buttery strawberry and blueberry pancakes. The whipped cream on top was so thick (in a good way!) it made the pancakes all the better. Sweet blueberries and even sweeter strawberries with the soft pancakes created the perfect ending to finish off this breakfast adventure.The Breakfast Club is definitely worth the wait. Amazing food, amazing service, and good company makes this place an amazing place to eat!",

    "text": "Because I'm a Yelper and because I just love food in general, I wanted to do two things in London: try the Indian food and have a traditional English breakfast! With The Breakfast Club, I could check off my English breakfast wish - plus there were so many good reviews I had to check it out!Read through the reviews and saw that there was going to be a wait no matter what, still tried to arrive a little past opening time. Was met with about a 45 minute wait in a line that ended up stretching toward the end of the street. Not too bad of a wait!** AMBIANCE **The theme of the restaurant was very laid back and 80s classic, I loved the cute decor and the wooden tables were so aesthetically pleasing. I will say it's a little crammed in there, I sat SUPER close to the table next to me, I could've bumped elbows with them if I moved an inch. ** FOOD **I had the full monty and my friend ordered the eggs benedict. The full monty came out and it just tasted bland and underwhelming. Even the sausage was just meh. It was edible, it just wasn't that good. The eggs benedict fared a little better, it was cooked well and tasted alright - it looked quite nice on the plate! ** SERVICE **Not sure if I went on an off day but we waited forever for our food to come out. The waitress was also really attentive to the table next to us but not to us? It was a little annoying but at the same time they're a busy restaurant so I can't really fault them too much - I'm sure they do their best because everyone working there seems to be running around but they could definitely improve on their efficiency. ** VERDICT **So overall I think it's decent, but not nearly as amazing as people raved about. I was glad I got to try an English meal though, maybe I'll go back again one day and try some other things off the menu!",

But the food is so good and the quantities humongous, that its no wonder that people make a beeline for this place.The coffee is amazing! Had a cup each when we sat down and asked for a takeaway each when we were leaving. I ordered the chorizo hash - to try something different and it was yummy. Didn't realise how large the portion sizes were and that my hash came with mushrooms mixed in it, otherwise I most certainly wouldn't have ordered the mushrooms on the side! The chorizo were the weakest element in this dish. I normally head straight for the protein in a bowl like this, but I enjoyed the crispy potato more.The Eggs Benedict were lovely - beautifully poached eggs and a lovely hollondaise.He assured me the banana bircher was very good - filling, nutritious and yummy. But it had bananas in it, so no way was I touching it. (I don't like fruits. There! I've said it! Don't judge me)Service was friendly and efficient. Everything on the menu looks so yum. The lady at the next table had ordered a pancake stack of sorts and EVERYONE in our section, was staring at her plate when it arrived. I also want to try their chicken and waffles. Food was pretty reasonable too for the portion size.",

Enough about the weather!I've learned that The Breakfast Club is an experience. You wait in the queue, because that's just what people do. The food is very good! I've tried the Pancakes, Eggs Royale, and Huevos Rancheros. We also had smoothies which were lovely. Would I come back again and wait in that line? No. But it's one of those fun things you do once.",

This place does a solid, no-nonsense breakfast. Neither the pulled pork nor the huevos were anything close to authentic, unfortunately, but it wasn't for wont of trying. Next time we'll be trying more traditional breakfast options, because the kitchen clearly knows what it's doing, and the home fries were amazing. The French toast side, for the Americans, is savoury egg toast rather than the sweet French toast we're used to; good, but be aware if that's not what you're craving.Prices are a touch steep, though consistent for Soho (think a tenner per main) but the portions actually reflect that, so you're definitely not walking out of here hungry.Bonus points for the warm, bubbly Scottish server.

But like everyone else who actually lives in London, when you see a queue outside the breakfast club, you turn around immediately!There's nothing damningly bad. It's just SO. NOT. WORTH. IT. Today I queued for 50 whole minutes with a friend who wanted to see what all the fuss is about (fair enough) and so we waited.. Everyone else in line were most definitely tourists.I normally get the pancakes & bacon, and what can I say, it was decent, as always - fluffy enough (but could be fluffier), perhaps a touch bland and a little stodgy (though not off-puttingly so. I'm nit picking). Personally, Balans is my pancake place of choice. They are just much better - light, tasty, with crispy crispy bacon and cheaper! We also got the pulled pork burger, apple and cinnamon french toast and eggs benedict as well and alas, all similarly average. The poached eggs themselves surpassed expectations, as did the chips (which came with the burger) but really, nothing to shout about and I think we were almost desperate to point out something good.In short, at odd hours of the day, it's a nice chill place to catch up with friends, the decor's all kitschy-pick-and-mix-cute-kinda-comfortable, the staff are always friendly and the notes on the wall are a nice touch but NEVER AGAIN WILL I QUEUE TO DINE HERE. Just go to the one in Hoxton, it's usually far less crowded.Also, they've taken the chocolate caramel milkshake off the menu. MINUS POINTS :(",

A friend and I came here on a Sunday morning at around 8:30 am (we thought the place opened at 9 because of Yelp so we wanted to get there \"early,\" but it turns out they actually open at 8 am) and we didn't have to wait at all. As for food, I ended up getting the Pancakes and Berries, which I really liked. The maple syrup was AMAZING and the vanilla cream...oh my goodness. The fruit was also particularly good - which might sound trivial to mention, but you'd be surprised at how many breakfast places fail on the fruit front. The service was awesome too! Our waiter was friendly and the food came out really quickly, which was nice because we were both really hungry. The only reason why I'm giving a 4 star and not a 5 is because I would've preferred the pancakes to be fluffier. Other than that, the taste was great and so was the service and vintage-y ambience. Highly recommend!",

I got seated right away and reading other reviews and my love for the full english breakfast, I ordered the full Monty. Now it was about $15, which is more than the typical full breakfast. It was loaded however, with bacon, sausage, black pudding, eggs, potatoes, mushrooms, beans, a tomato and delicious Multigrain toast. There was nothing too spectacular about the meal, but it was very filling and I did not have to wait long. Not sure if I would wait over an hour as other people have, but I think for how long I waited, that was a perfect meal.",

There was a line when we arrived before opening, however we were lucky enough to be part of the first few who were seated straight away. One of my friends is gluten intolerant and after asking the advice of the waiter, he pulled out a full list of what she could/could not have. He also didn't seem perturbed about going through the list with her, even though he could have made a fuss about spending so much time answering her questions (very good service). When breakfast came it was exactly what we had wanted and the coffee was fantastic! The turn around time from ordering to delivery was very quick too! Even though a large table had ordered right before us. Although I had heard great things about The Breakfast Club, it's nice to experience it and know it lives up to the hype (without any pretentious vibe).",

The wife ordered a flat white and the chorizo and potatoes dish while I stuck with Coffee and the All-American (pancakes, eggs, sausage, bacon, pancakes, and an angioplasty). Servings were HUGE and neither of us could finish our plates. Staff is very friendly and the kitschy interior has an obviously distinct vintage 80s vibe. As well as an odd introduction of Elvis throughout. The menu will give you a few chuckles if you read some of the commentary. And where can I get me one of the mugs?!",

I went On a Sunday morning around 9am and there was 1 home oil in line but then they left and I just had to wait for a guy to finish paying his bill. It has a very homey feel inside, with random decorations on the wall including an old metal sign. The tables are like something you would find at a garage sale or your grandmas attic. So it felt like you went over to an old family members house for breakfast. I forgot to take a pic of my food but I got the Vegetarian All-American which had pancakes, eggs, veggie sausage, and roasted potatoes. They definitely give you an ample serving of whatever you order so its definitely with the money. Everything tastes delicious. One thing that was different about them that I like is that they serve dressed pressed juices and smoothies. You can watch them making your juice. I got the Slow Boy; which had apples, carrots, orange, and ginger. While we were there the back dope was open to let in some breeze and a drag queen came to the door and was talking to a guy sitting near to it. I thought the drag queen was his friend cause he was laughing but then later one of the staff came over and said how he thought the drag queen was the guys friend but then he came around to the front and was bothering people in line lol. The waiter was like \"welcome to Soho\" lol",

So we rushed to this place and were delighted to see 5-6 different egg options on the menu. However soon afterwards, the waiter announced to us that they don't actually serve breakfast that late in the day. I mean, come on! It's the \"Breakfast Club\" the one thing you should serve all day is Breakfast!Since they have eggs in the menu (and I would think a frying pan) I don't see why they couldn't just make the omelette but there you go.Tip: if you do manage to order, stay away from the chips and the guacamole. Both very disapponting.PS: there's no link between the classic 80s film and this place (not that we expected it but it just makes the name of this place even more pointless and an enigma).",

Even with the 50% off offer, I still didn't see it was value for money and there is no way I would ever want to visit it again. Oh did I mentioned they have one of the most annoying websites?",

The waitress kept dropping things, forgetting to bring cutlery, forgetting our orders - it was beyond ridiculous. The pancakes were completely flat and had a hair on the dish. The poached eggs with chorizo, chili and avocado on a muffin were great in theory but just too heavy and too busy. The Apple and cinnamon French toast with maple syrup was lovely - not soggy, a nice lining old egg batter on the thick cut toast. Whilst the rustic and simple decor is charming, the food was not entirely satisfying. I've been to other branches of this place and enjoyed them and the quality of the food more.",

Pancakes are a bit on the heavy side (I prefer light and fluffy ones), and the eggs benedict arrived cold and lacking flavour. The orange juice comes in a really small cup for the price you pay too. I get that the servers are overwhelmed by the crowds and all, but service tends to be slow. Plenty of other cafes do great brunch (such as St Ali's, Lantana), enough said!",

The only problem is the long queue that can form here in the mornings. I understand that by keeping this in such a small venue, the queue grows and the venue subsequently increases in popularity and renown, but the food really isn't as good or unique enough to warrant queuing for an hour or so to get in (though often you're so hungry by the time you get through the door that it does seem like the best food you've ever tasted!). Honestly, I'd say go if you can get in, but otherwise avoid the queue and go to any one of the nearby hotels and cafes offering similar breakfast fare.",

I think it's quite ridiculous there is such a queue all day every day, it is frustrating because its a great place but who wants to wait outside for 30-40 minutes on a weekend ? Every time I end up going elsewhere instead of waiting. It has that hipster feel to it, it's \"a place to be\", which I like but I'm not bothered enough about to wait that long. Having said that, once inside it is indeed the ideal breakfast place, the look and feel are spot on and the food absolutely great at a totally reasonable price. I do understand people hang around at the tables for a while and have to say that despite the resulting queue I do think its nice the staff respect a lazy lunch instead of encouraging faster turnover. Over all I'm half enthused half frustrated ! Would go again if there is no more than a 15min queue.",

For some reason I thought it would be more like avocado toast but the bun was soft and eggs a little runny. It lacked flavor. Then pancakes were super fluffy and delightful. The whipped cream and berries provided a good balance of sweetness to the pancakes. Both juices we ordered were good too!",

    "text": "The Breakfast Club is a pretty popular breakfast restaurant in London so of course, as visitors, my husband and I had to try it. There was a line when we got there, but only maybe 7-8 groups before us. We waited about 45 mins - 1 hour at 9:30am. It wasn't too bad, except that it was cold! Inside it is cozy, but there was sufficient space so people weren't on top of each other. We were seated along with another couple who came in after us. The food was great, not amazing, but great for London. My husband is a breakfast lover, so we always have to try different types of breakfast food from wherever we go. So onto the food:Avocado & Poached egg- avocado with lemon and pumpkin seeds on rye bread with a poached egg on top. This dish was good, but then as I was eating it, it became too lemony for me. However, still great!Pancakes with Berries with a side of bacon- Pancakes stacked with whipped cream and berries. Pancakes were great, but not the best we've ever had. It was a bit on the dry side compared to what we are used to. The bacon was good, as expected.English Breakfast & Green tea- the teas were just okay, nothing to write home about.My only complaint is that the waiter took the order of the couple who came in after us first and they even had their drinks before someone decided to come to our table to take our order. A bit of disappointment, only because one should be taking orders from the order that people came in.",

The restaurant is very tiny, but cozy with lots of character. I ordered the berries pancakes with potatoes and bacon. My husband ordered the sea salt caramel pancakes minus the banana with the chocolate on the side. We both thoroughly enjoyed our pancakes and bacon! The pancakes were soft and fluffy and the fresh cream on top just took it up another notch! We also ordered tea which was just hot water with fresh lemons and ginger, but it was delicious as well...perfect for a cold rainy Sunday afternoon! I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in London! P.S. The staff is amazing and cheerful and they play a great mix of music!",

    "text": "I bookmarked this place a while ago, so i was glad when a visiting friend gave me the perfect excuse to show him \"a very popular London brunch spot\".We got there around 1 and there was a huge line, but we decided to persevere. Shortly after we got on line, and huge group left, so we developed a sense of false hope about how quickly we would reach the front. And the more time passed, the more we felt committed, and afraid to relinquish our spot only to face another line somewhere else.One hour later, we're finally seated at a table for 4, next to another two-person group. It was annoyingly intimate, but whatever, we were hungry, and I figured that liquor would make everything better.Alas, after flipping the menu over 10 times, we realized there was no liquor to be had. What is the point of serving brunch without alcohol, honestly?Then our waiter comes over. We quickly tell him what we want because, after waiting over an hour, we're starving and trying to salvage the afternoon sunlight by getting in and out, especially since there's no liquor to linger over.The waiter then makes small talk with the couple next to us, and loudly notes \"Thank you so much for asking me how I'm doing. You know some people just come in and quickly order and forget that I'm a person.\"So here's the thing. 1) All the aforementioned awfulness. 2) He immediately asked us \"What can I get you?\", not \"How are you doing?\", hence we responded with a food order and not a conversation.At any rate, I ordered the Veggie All American. The eggs, potatoes and vegetarian sausage were all good, but the pancakes tasted off. Also had a side of French toast, which was a-okay. But the waiters comment left a bad taste in my mouth, literally and figuratively.The great irony of our initial interaction with the waiter, is that at the end, when we paid our bill, we tipped 20%, as is custom where I'm from, whereas the other couple tipped him nothing. Wonder if he preferred the cash or conversation.",

    "text": "+ ALWAYS massive queue, consisting largely of tourists + Minimum of 30 mins wait in the morning + Tasty big American breakfast but certainly NOT WORTH the wait There is always a lot of people waiting outside. For some reason almost all of them are tourists. This time, I got here at about 10.30 on Wednesday morning. Still, a pretty long queue. I waited for about 40 minutes to be seated. I have been to the one in Old Street too. But I feel this one (in SOHO) is the busiest hence the queue longest. As you'd expect, inside the restaurant feels a little crammed and busy. I ordered All American breakfast, which consists of pancakes, two eggs, bacons and roasted potatoes. Potatoes with caramelised onions had a nice flavour of rosemary and other herbs. Pancakes are nice and fluffy. But the main attraction of this place, for me at least, is the generous portion though I suspect it is not comparable to real American size. My verdict is that as charming the place is, it is surely NOT WORTH WAITING FOR 40 MINUTES. Really, why are there queues on weekdays? What do those people do???? (I don't count. I'm in between jobs so I'm ok.) If you are curious though, my recommendation is to order one of the American combo breakfast things, marvel at the portion of it while perhaps exchange some remarks with your friend(s) about the way they serve sweet and savoury on single plate and get it done with. I would feel no compelling need to come back twice.",

Not sure if it was an off day for them or it's the norm, but their breakfast was...well, very standard. I mean, how good can breakfast get? It's one of those hipster places that wants you to pay more for breakfast when you could get it cheaper elsewhere! Admittedly though, the decor was nice, and the pancakes were good, but definitely not worth waiting that Long.",

When we left almost an hour later, the queue had stretched down the block. Get there early!Ambiance is nice- mismatched tables and chairs, Pac-Man art on the walls. We ordered the fresh squeezed orange juice (why don't more places do this in the states?!!) to start. I had the Reggie the Veggie, a full English vegetarian style with beans, potatos, eggs, toast, veggie sausage, roast tomato, and mushroom. It was more food than I could possible hope to finish. My boyfriend got the Full Monty (full English) and almost cleaned his plate. He hates blood pudding but raved this one was done properly and ate it all. Considering the line outside, we never felt rushed or unimportant. The price was good for the amount of food we got and we were full til dinner time. We will definitely come back next time we're in London and will recommend to all our friends!",

All things considering, the line wasn't so bad--about 35 minutes in a Tuesday at around 9:30am. In order to get another couple out of the rain, we agreed to sharing our table. Unfortunately they didn't speak much English, so we didn't make any new friends. The inside is incredibly eclectic, and we had a great time reading notes and drawings left in bits of paper and money from around the globe as we waited for our food. The eggs florentine was delicious--the eggs were poached perfectly. My husband's berry oats concoction seemed small, but it was incredibly filling--and we loved the lingering taste of peanut butter. It took quite a long time to get our bill after we were finished, but that might just be my impatient American mentality.",

    "text": "Based on the reviews I read I had high expectations for this place. It was one of the few brunch restaurants that served a more traditional American menu. Since I'm not keen on a British breakfast, this seemed like the place to go. It was a Sunday around 11:30 and the line was quite long. Based on the reviews I had read this was expected. We waited probably 4mins - 1hr. The host that was managing tables was very nice and informative. He continued to keep us updated on how much longer and when we could expect a table. While waiting in line I noticed that the crowd was definitely younger (majority under 30) which seemed a little strange. The atmosphere inside is nothing to write home about. I wouldn't call it charming. I guess you could say quirky but overall unimpressive. It was quite crowded and they had very few tables. We ended up being seated at a community table with four other people. I was disappointed because they changed their menu after 12. It seemed weird for. Breakfast place to change over their menu. I ordered the eggs Florentine with salmon and my mom got the berry pancakes. Both dishes were good. A solid meal and a hell of a lot better than most other English breakfast choices. However they didn't hold a candle to come of the breakfasts I've had back in the US. I guess it's all relative. My eggs Florentine was cooked well. The hollandaise sauce didn't have much flavor. I didn't like the bun it was served on. It was too thick and tasted like the bottom side of a hamburger bun. Moms pancakes were very good. The serving size was very large. It came with plenty of berries and a lot of homemade whip cream. The cream was very good and so sweet that it really didn't need syrup. I did end up using some though because I thought the pancakes were dry. The orange juice was not fresh which was a bummer. I thought about giving this a three star rating but I thought it wouldn't be fair since it was a good breakfast, fast and had friendly service. I don't know that I would wait an hour in line for it but I also don't know of the other brunch options that London offers. So this may be as good as it gets.",

The veggie sausage was nicely seasoned unlike many others but was definitely an unexpected texture. Finally, the oat milk latte wasn't my favorite - I couldn't really taste the oat milk flavor.

We stood at the front of the restaurant waiting for a hostess for a bit, but when she did come by we were happy to see there was a table open for us. We asked if we could sit at one of the open tables by the window, but she told us we could not sit there because it wasn't clean. Okay.... We would have gladly waited for it to be cleaned off, but that didn't seem like it was an option for us. When we were finally seated we ended up ordering a bottle of champagne, orange juice, eggs benedict, avocado toast on rye, and the salted caramel banoffee pancakes. All of these were extremely delicious! The ambiance in here is great: some old school, hipster vibes. Although the food and the atmosphere were decent, the service was sub-par. We waited a while to have our orders taken, and after we finally got our orders in it took another 20 minutes to wait for the bottle of champagne, and another 10 when they realized they forgot to give us glasses. We also ordered water which came with bits of a black substance floating in it (coffee grounds perhaps?). Either way, it was a bit unappetizing, and the entire carafe was filled with these black pieces floating in it. Even the glasses they gave us for the champagne were dirty and still had other people's mouth/finger marks on it. Two thumbs down on quality control. Overall, this is a cute place to stop in if you're looking for some decent breakfast with a cute hipster vibe- but don't expect a 5 star restaurant across the board.",

I took a longer route from my hotel to do some site seeing and wish I hadn't because right at opening time there was already a massive line out the door! The employees were quick when it came to getting people in and out of the tiny little establishment. However, they did this in a way that wasn't overbearing and making you feel like you need to rush. Super cool guys running the shift! I was torn between the Chorizo Hash and Huevos al Benny. Ended up ordering the Benny! The chorizo sausage was really tasty! Had a nice zing to it and went really well with the avocado on the Benny. They even mixed lemon into the avocado which is a crowd pleaser for me! I got the potatoes on the side and that was probably my least favorite part of the meal. Don't get me wrong, they were good! But they were missing some variety of hot sauce ( would pair amazing with chipotle). The FRESH squeezed orange juice was DELISH. Ordered two because one just wasn't enough! They sell pitchers too for those coming in groups. Will be coming back and sampling everything else on the menu!",

A staff member came out and gave each person an estimate on how long it would take. Since I was dining solo it only took me about 30 chilly minutes. Y'all it was cold!I decided to try the cabbie breakfast. It consisted of egg, sausage, bacon, beans and toast. I wasn't a huge fan of the beans but had to try a traditional dish. The bacon and eggs were cooked perfectly and the sausage had a nice bite to it.All in all, I was pleased.",

I had their \"All-American Breakfast\" which tasted just like home. As an American, I tried staying away from anything we have back at home, but a full breakfast just sounded TOO GOOD to pass up! I'm a huge breakfast lover and the Breakfast Club has my seal of approval! ;-)The pancakes were fluffy, but were sort of plain and didn't quite have that \"buttermilk\" taste. They were still good though, especially accompanied with fluffy scrambled eggs and bacon!! Would definitely love to go back whenever I'm in London again.",

However, we just so happened to be the only party of 2 so we were able to get seated within 10 minutes which upset some parties ahead of us, but y'all know the rule regarding popular brunch places, the smaller the party, the better.Ambiance: Your typical 80s American diner (I can actually call it that because I'm from NYC) with a wall decked out with notes and currencies. Food: I ordered the chorizo hash, which turned out to be a huge portion (I barely ate 1/2 the bowl), but it was super delicious. My only critique would be that there would be less potatoes and more peppers/mushrooms/chorizo so that the ratio would be better. The boyfriend ordered the All-American, which sounds exactly like what it was. A huge platter of pancakes, eggs, breakfast meats, and potatoes. If I could, I'd give this place a 3.5/5. I personally don't think it was worth the wait or lived up to its hype, but if you're in the area and you're craving an American breakfast, this is the place.",

And thank goodness for Yelp in London! Otherwise we wouldn't have known about this place! And boy did it live up to its name!I seriously wanted to try everything on this menu, but settled for the pancakes with fresh cream and berries, since everyone else was raving about them. And now I get the hype! Those pancakes really did something to me (in a food type of way). I could have eaten another stack, but did not want to be judged as that hungry American. The fresh juice was also delicious and refreshing. Not to mention the music! Talk about good taste! So if you're into a traditional American breakfast/brunch, you definitely want to check out this place and then walk the streets of Soho to walk off any guilt you may have from your gluttony. Other notable information is that this place is reasonably priced and can accommodate strollers (and we had a double buggy, but were able to take it apart and fit the car seats on the seats).Pros:-pretty centrally located-relatively priced-those pancakes and fresh whipped cream and berries!!!Cons:-relatively small-crazy queue on weekends, son be forewarned and plan early!!",

We picked the Breakfast Club because who doesn't want breakfast for dinner?! This is the perfect place to eat before hitting bars and clubs too! My friend got the eggs florentine and I had the pancakes. The pancakes were served with real vanilla whipped cream and berries!! SO good! I loved the combination with their Canadian maple syrup. I also got a hot chocolate with multicolored marshmallows! It was amazingly creamy and delicious. My friend enjoyed her eggs as well and said it was very fresh. I've never been here in the morning but I'm sure it's difficult to get a table.. if you love breakfast, check this place out!",

Definitely loved the trendy/hipster vibe inside. I have a major weakness to anything benedict or benedict-like, so I ordered the Eggs Royale (Smoked salmon on toasted English muffin with hollandaise), which came with a small side of greens (spinach?) drizzled with a vinaigrette. Definitely liked it a lot! Also got an fresh-squeezed orange juice with my meal. Overall, I was pretty happy with my meal. I do wish that the portions were a wee but more. Also, one of the poached eggs were a bit more overdone than the other... which I found odd, and the taste of the vinegar or whatever they used was a little too detectable for me... But overall, I would still come back for another meal!",

The place has a really chilled vibe and they have a jukebox where you can request songs and the whole place is filled with quirky decor. there's a couple scattered across London in Hoxton, \u00a0London Bridge and Angel so i definitely recommend a visit if you're ever near by!",

The Soho branch is the original, and there are now other Breakfast Club in various locations around London, including Shoreditch and Spitalfield. I was catching up with an old friend over Saturday brunch so we met outside the venue at 11am. I have heard about the queues but I thought I wouldn't mind since we had a lot to catch up on. It took an hour to get in, so it was technically lunch by the time we ordered. On the plus side, one of the staff came out at some point to hand out shot glass size of their fruit smoothies to appease us. The restaurant is tiny and quirkily decorated, reminding me of small American cafes you see in backwater, touristy spots filled with memorabilia left behind by tourists from around the world. The selection of breakfast items is fab - you can have a full English breakfast, American pancakes with the works, huevos rancheros, or you can opt for the healthy stuff like porridge and muesli. I ordered the huevos rancheros since the description was mouthwateringly delicious and I wasn't disappointed. The plate of food came quickly and it looked better than it sounded. And the taste? Even better!The \"mains\", if you will, seems expensive for breakfast, at under a tenner, but considering I subsequently couldn't eat another thing the rest of the day I would say its a bargain!",

It was pretty good, though I would consider American breakfasts in America a lot more satisfying to the tongue. \u00a0The bacon was really good. \u00a0The pancakes were not so fluffy, but the maple syrup that came with it was really good. \u00a0I enjoyed the hot chocolate here. \u00a0It was very chocolate-y and tasted delicious. \u00a0The service was pretty good, though the restaurant was a bit cramped yet cozy. \u00a0This is a great place for an early morning meal but a little over-rated in my opinion. \u00a0I wouldn't wait anymore than 15 minutes to get into the restaurant but it's good to try.",

On a weekday at 11. This place had to be good. The long-haired, somewhat overwhelmed waiter assured me it would be five minutes; I was skeptical and started yelping other places. Five minutes later I was eating my words as he sat is down at a communal table. And by communal I don't mean a long wooden table with a few chairs between me and the neighbors. I mean legit communal, like sandwiched up next to a couple enjoying their full Englishes.Mom and I hovered for a bit, then got over it and decided we were too hungry to care. And honestly, it didn't matter in the least, the food was THAT GOOD. I had the Breakfast burrito (sans chorizo) and Ma had the Chorizo Hash Browns. We tucked in and didn't notice each other, let alone the couple squeezed in next to us. Halfway through the meal two burly American guys took their place. Send em in, I was quite at my leisure.I finished with a flat white and Mom had an Earl grey. Both beverages held up the standard.Some more pros: delicious food, speedy service, lovely yellow front, plentiful condiments at every tableCons: grungy interior reminiscent of a punk club except not dimly lit, tight squeezeI'll definitely be back!",

It seems that there is a permanent wait to get in here. So it did not come as a surprise to me when I had to wait outside in the freezing cold for 45 minutes on my first visit here. However any anguish was more than made up for by the food. I ordered an English breakfast (the full monty) while my friend went for the huevos rancheros. He liked it very much, especially the chorizos. This came as a bit of a surprise to me as I thought that the sausages were the weak points of my breakfast. But they were more than made up for by the eggs, bacon and the black pudding. My favourite breakfast drink is the banana milkshake and the Breakfast Club did not disappoint on that. A pretty heavy brunch set us back by about \u00a315, which is not excessive. But I don't foresee many visits here. The long wait is a turn off and there are many places which are at least equally good closer to home. But if I spend a whole night drinking in central London ... then maybe ...",

The staff are friendly and there are a couple of comfy sofas at the front, though the rest of the chairs in the back are a bit hit and miss. Also, whenever I go they seem to playing feelgood cheese anthems. A good place to go for well-done English cafe food and smoothies, though I'd avoid during peak hours in the week when Soho's media population descend and eat lunch with their Macs.",

I'm from Texas so breakfast tacos, burritos, and taquitos are a God-given right there, so it was nice to see it across the pond. My friends enjoyed it. It's a good breakfast joint.",

You even have coffee mugs with freakin' Pac-Man on them. And yet, you left me feeling dirty.Dirty because my entire visit to your establishment was tainted by little tiny flies buzzing in and out of my face, my chai latte, my friend's haloumi wrap, and taking my patience with them.Now, I should base my review on the food, yes? (I didn't eat anything but my friend's food looked amaze.) My chai was nice, but it was served in a cup without a handle and I couldn't drink it for a good 10 minutes because I was afraid my finger prints were going to disintegrate if I held the glass for more than two seconds.Flies, in my experience, equal DIRTY THINGS. There must be sticky, scary things on the floor of this place. I appreciate it's been hot this week. I appreciate that with windows open, bugs get in. But this was not one fly. This was an extended family of flies, including all of their inlaws, all hanging out in one particular area - MY FACE.And so, Breakfast Club, I give you two stars. Not only for the flies, but because you may have altered my identify forever by stealing my fingerprints.",

I can't count the number of times I rolled out of bed, grabbed 4 friends, and headed down to The Breakfast Club for some hot greasy (in a good way) breakfast food and a smoothie. The place is small, so most of the time we waited for about 15-20 minutes for a table for 4-5. If you dont like waiting, go in a smaller group, but I was happy to wait week after week for this amazing breakfast. The breakfast burrito is my favorite, with powerful chorizo packed into a bulging tortilla of egg, guac, cheese and probably some illicit drugs. I take my breakfast food seriously, and lucky for me, so does the Breakfast Club. The staff is so friendly and the kitschy wall decor is always a good conversation starter. If you sit in the back on the left look in the drawers for a notebook full of memorabilia left by other breakfast lovers just like you. It's pure heaven.",

Bacon, sausage, eggs, hash browns, black pudding, mushrooms, tomato and a side of toast (as if you needed a side). Its such an amazingly delicious dish, that I am getting irritated that I am not in the UK right now to hit TBC tomorrow morning :( The pancakes are fluffy and delicious, served with warm syrup...

This is the first place I found using Qype and what fabulous results. I got converted to espresso at this place and it certainly packed a punch. Wonderful. The day's most important meal just got its own restaurant. I wonder aloud if one is allowed to eat here all day?",

It was mid-morning on a Tuesday and the place was still jumping, but we got a table right away. It was next to a pretty breezy back-door alley entrance, and that's the only real reason for any points off this place. The Wife had Reggie the Veggie. Great eggs and a passable veggie sausage, but the beans for breakfast put her off. Sorry Honey, should have gone with the Huevos Rancheros like your \"esposo macho\"! As a self-declared Hueveos expert-o, I give this version high marks. Any time your huevos come with fresh guacamole and sour cream, you're already a cut above. The tortillas were laden with eggs and salsa, and the chorizo-less hash was a perfect side for the veggie-groom. All of this in an atmosphere so cozy, it was like breakfasting in your friend's kitchen.",

There are a choice of different sized tables to sit at and an assortment of chairs which you may find yourself swapping about to get a more comfortable one. The brunch menu was one of the better ones I've seen in awhile but as soon as I saw the bacon and egg sandwiches the guys across from us had, I knew that I had to have it too. Just remember to order at the bar or you will end up feeling like a numpty wondering why they haven't come to serve you yet. The menu does state Order at the counter but since we hadn't yet had our morning coffee, we can be excused can't we? The bacon and egg sandwich was delicious and hit the brunch spot. They did forget our coffees which after a bit of prompting from us arrived just after our last mouthful. I can see this place becoming a regular of mine. Next time I visit, i'm ordering the porridge. Again spotted at another table, it looked incredibly good, even the glassware it came in. I'll just hope the coffee arrives in a timely fashion!

As an American I obviously was required to order the All American Breakfast: Eggs, sausage, plenty of bacon, country potatoes, and two pancakes.First off, I'm a big eater and this was just the right amount of food. The bacon was the highlight. It was lean and there was about 5 strips of it. Sausage was good, although burnt. The potatoes were also surprisingly good, and the eggs (free range) were poached nicely. I would have given this place 5 stars if the pancakes were better, though. Sadly they are flat, unfluffy and dull. They use real maple syrup, but it just barely makes up for the poor flapjacks.The price was reasonable (for London) as well. It was \u00a311 for the plate and \u00a32 for a decent cup of tea.Overall this is a solid place to get a good breakfast, though be warned that if you don't come early you could wait in line for up to an hour.",

The three guys running the joint are efficient, but with flare and swag and a chill attitude. \u00a0They are people you'd want to hang out with. \u00a0Which made the rest of my experience all the more disappointing. I have to also say, the food LOOKED good.Bad: \u00a0Let me go ahead and preface this with the elephant in the room: I'm an A-MER-rican (think the Obama pronunciation). \u00a0I love pancakes and pancakes love me. \u00a0So when I saw the chance to try them on this side of the pond, I jumped at it. \u00a0Especially when I saw all the great reviews. \u00a0I usually don't give bad reviews much credence. \u00a0Especially when most people have a positive experience. \u00a0But I gotta tell you, this wasn't a good eating experience. \u00a0This review is for my hommies who are familiar was Cracker Barrel and IHop and even Dennys. \u00a0THIS IS NOT THE SPOT! \u00a0Not for pancakes. \u00a0Maybe if I had tried something else on the menu. \u00a0These cakes were so pretty to look at, but tasted of...nothing. And there were four of these truly offensive items on my plate. \u00a0Again, they looked good. \u00a0But they bare no resemblance to their American counterpart as far as taste. \u00a0They were thick and cakey and needed a lot of help in the form of maple syrup and BACON! \u00a0 Thank goodness for bacon, without which I could not have stomached the customary half portion I wolfed down to be polite (I didn't want to be the rude angry tourist). \u00a0Ugly: \u00a0My face once I left. \u00a0I'm a good actress when it comes to faking the funk. \u00a0But even I couldn't keep up the pretense once I got out of earshot. \u00a0Oh Lawd please help these people!Some friendly advice to the very cool owners: -Add salt (no one is going to get diabetes from a half teaspoon) OR add some yummy bacon bits to your batter. - Check your recipe- pancakes should be light and fluffy, not cakey- Go on doing what you're doing. \u00a0The reviews tell the story. \u00a0Most people seem to like them.Some friendly advice to unsuspecting American tourist:-Don't get your hopes up. \u00a0This is UK style! \u00a0You're on their turf and apparently, salt is not a food group here!",

I went with the Full Monty despite all the other tempting pancakes and egg benedict on offer. A traditional English breakfast which delivered as promised. A wonderful treat, filled for the afternoon of walking the British Museum, meetings and speaking later this afternoon.While the poached eggs were done well (as is custom here in UK), they were wonderful. The bacon was filled with flavor, but the sausage was one of the best I've ever had. Ordered avocado instead of mushroom, and on the toast with the sausage and roasted tomato... heavenly breakfast. I've joined the club. You should too.",

It came with a huge stack, loads of fresh cream, and lots of berries which is my absolute favorite!! The pancakes were super fluffy and paired perfectly with the cream, syrup, and berries. Usually I crave something savory so I took a bite of my sisters and brothers All American Breakfast and they were amazing!!! Cravings 1000% satisfied.Coming from California we don't have that many places like this in my area, so it was definitely lovely to have made it to the Breakfast Club. I wish I could say I would come back here soon, but it is unlikely. But when I get rich and famous and can travel the world. I'll be hittin up this wonderful country first. Until next time, London!",

We decided to wait and ended up waiting about an hour until we were seated. I didn't mind waiting but you have to wait outside and it was cold and raining lightly. They waited on us pretty quickly and the food didn't take too long either. One thing I noticed was that there were a lot of singles sitting at tables meant for 2-4 people. Would be nice if they sat people together or had more tables for 1. I had the avocado toast and it was good but the \"toast\" was more of a cracker (very hard) and the dish was very lemony. My husband had the pancakes with berries and I tried it and it was amazing. If you like sweet breakfast getting the pancakes is a must here. If we make it back to London we will go back!",

    "text": "I've always been a fan of The Breakfast Club. Big portions, decent prices, and tasty food. Only caveat is to avoid peak hours because of loooonnnggg lines (no reservations, unless weekdays after 6pm). The Soho location is the smallest of the other Breakfast Clubs. The menu is smaller, eg) they only offer the Moroccan Chicken Salad (\u00a38.50), and not the other 3 that you see on the online menu (Waldorf'ish Salad, Mardi Gras Salad, Rocket & Parmesan). I was in the mood for healthy, so was impressed with the Moroccan Chicken Salad. Portion was good and got full. It was fresh and not overly done with the tzatziki. The grilled red and yellow peppers gave the salad an extra meaty touch and flavor. Also, ordered the When Haloumi Met Salad Wrap (\u00a38.30). It was delic. Came with a side of coleslaw and some lamb's lettuce. If you're not a fan of coleslaw, cancel it out. The mayo was oozing about and I didn't like it. The wrap was tasty- the balsamic reduction was on point and added good flavor. You can also request to make the wraps into a salad version. Next time I will probably do this because the balsamic would be a good dressing. The juice maker was broken during my visit, so was a bummer. Hopefully they've fixed it by now. It's BYOB after 6pm at this location.",

Your best bet is to get there bang on 9am, or just after 10am as the first wave or two of hangry customers filter it and tables open up.

This place kept coming up near the top of the list.The short of it. Most everything overcooked and dried out. Fortunately, I was not as hungry as I thought I would be, because I didn't find enough that was good to make a full meal. Fortunately, I had a breakfast meeting at a nice hotel the next morning where I was able to get my full breakfast done properly.On the positive side, since I was a single at a busy time, I ended up at the communal table with another single next to me who was very interesting to visit with.",

All the decor takes you back to the 90's, its basically like stepping into a time machine. We have to queue for a good 45 minutes before we got a spot but the line moves pretty quickly. My friend got the vegetarian english breakfast and it looked pretty hefty. The potatoes were on point. I got the berries and cream pancakes and they were amazing. The pancakes are more cake-ey than I am used to, but I was surprised that i enjoyed it. Usually I like my pancakes light and airy but the way they cooked it worked with the berries and cream. The cream was amazing and so light. I honestly could have ate an entire bowl of just the cream and berries. All the staff were super kind and the customer service was on point. Even when we were waiting in line, we had staff members checking up on us, and we even had green smoothie samples. All in all if you are in the neighborhood, and you have time, check this place out. Tip: try to hit the place up before 12pm to avoid a long queue",

We were looking for something unique and wanted to get out of Westminster and tour other areas of London. This had by FAR the most reviews (and top rated) so we took a cab to Soho to check it out. Walking in, (after about a 45 min wait outside) it was almost like a scene out of \"Friends\" or something. The place had a very 90's vibe - complete with the music, atmosphere and even the casual nature of the staff. We were seated and took to the menus right away. Great selection, I opted for a mocha and the Eggs Benedict. My husband had their best seller - the English Breakfast. Both were delicious and just what we were looking for. Despite the wait outside, we were not rushed to leave and it was actually quite calm inside, even though I know how busy it was. The ONLY reason I'm giving this place a 4-star instead of 5, is simply because of the wait, and it being outside. The street had an awful smell and it was dreary, so rain was off and on and just made the wait worse. I was hoping and praying that the wait would be worth it - and much to my expectation, it was :)",

We were told very nicely that we would have to wait outside, there was a queue of around six in front if us. How had we missed them walking in! Waiting outside was nice as it was a crisp sunny morning and it wasn't long before we were given a very tight table. We ordered the full Monty and the half Monty and the portions were huge, only thing missing was a sausage and this was soon rectified. The place had an energetic buzz, and the staff were very friendly. When we left about an hour and a half later the queue was around 20! Great place, highly recommended!",

The glowing reviews and the fast forming queue outside seemed to reinforce this hope.My meal arrived, four pancakes with bacon piled on top. I removed the bacon, noticing that on the same piece there could be areas of cooked-to-perfection and almost-raw, as if, perhaps, they were cooked lying on top of one another and all of a piece didn't have contact with the grill. Ah well, on to the pancakes, the one on top was overdone, the one below it more so, the third...seemed just about right, dark golden brown. I shrugged and dug in, cutting a piece and dabbing it in the pool of syrup on the plate. There were two issues I had with this pancake: 1) it was neither light nor fluffy, more like pound cake, 2) As I was chewing through this heavy monstrosity I caught a glimpse of the last pancake below it and felt bad. The last one was so badly burned I felt I should have rightly saved the one I was eating as a donor for skin grafts for it.The waiter breezed by with a smile and dropped off more syrup. Yeah, that's not the problem here.",

I had heard of several friends meeting regularly at this \u00a0venue despite its notorious wait times so I jumped at the opportunity when I could make it to this famed establishment. At the outset, the cramped quarters and the consequent wait in the bracing cold did not set things up well, but I counted on the food being divine, to make up for that. Now, I'd say the food is probably 3 stars - A-OK. Portion sizes are generous, nothing is offensive and everything is as expected, and quite reminiscent of American brunch menus. But really, I failed to see what the big deal was, and therefore, I couldn't help but rate it only 2 stars...would have been 3 stars if I didn't go in with such high expectations!",

I have no idea how they remain so paitent! You don' feel pressured to leave when you finish your meal which is nice, unless you are in the queue looking through the window at someone taking 30 minutes to finish a cup of coffee!",

    "text": "Probably one of the better places to get breakfast in Soho, but I'd suggest going to the Shoreditch branch instead. There's always a line at Soho, and the inside is really cramped. Waiting 30 minutes for brunch and then having to sit on a stool with my back rubbing against someone else's table (and having to get up whenever the table next to me wants to leave, or is seated, or has to use the restroom) isn't very pleasant.The food is good, but not fantastic. They serve English and American breakfasts like you'd find in a greasy-spoon diner, so don't go expecting the healthiest cuisine. The eggs are good but the pancakes were rather bland. French toast was so-so--not as well-seasoned as it should be. On the plus side, prices are reasonable and portion sizes are decent. The smoothies are one of the highlights--try the \"Green is Good\". Coffee isn't bad either--something a lot of diners do shockingly poorly, so I'd give them a 4/5 for the coffee.Service is very hit-or-miss--more recently, I've found it leaning towards \"miss\". The ambiance is friendly and casual but not too tacky.Overall I'm a fan of the Breakfast Club, but their Soho location isn't a shining star. Stick to the eggs and smoothies, try to beat the rush, and hope you get a good seat. Otherwise, go to Shoreditch.",

    "text": "'Eat my shorts!'I'd just like to start by saying that I desperately wanted to like this place yet left wanting to tell my waiter to do just that. It's a shame considering The Breakfast Club is one of my favourite Molly Ringwald films just after Pretty in Pink.Let's start with the service; this is where they definitely fell short. Cafes are, in my own personal opinion, a great place for 'table of 1s' to go and not feel completely 'out of sorts'. After a friend had raved about this place, I decided it was a good spot to get a bit of lunch and spend my afternoon out of the office getting work done without the concern that the waiters and waitresses would be breathing down my neck to 'get out'. \u00a0Not even close. Upon arriving, the hostess/waitress sat me in corner table that faced...wait for it...a wall. I wondered if I was being punished for being a table of 1 and not having more people with me? Perhaps I should have pulled my significant other out of work or invited the homeless person I saw earlier that morning for a late lunch just to subsidise their pay check? Regardless, I decided not to be a stereotypical New Yorker by demanding another table. After all, it was semi crowded (though towards the end of the lunch rush hour) and I didn't want to make a huge fuss. When the waiter arrived to take my order, it was as if I was asking the world of him. I was worried I might really upset him when I asked, a few seconds after taking my order, for a glass of tap water with my meal. For the duration of my time there I felt as though I was perpetually in the way of the waitstaff. Par sitting up entirely straight in my chair and ensuring my arms did not dare leave the perimeter of my table, I found I was getting knocked into more than most customers in the cafe. Perhaps this was because they sat me at a table that was probably once used for storage? I felt a bit like Milton from Office Space. Leave my stapler alone Lumberg! (Or in this case, let me drink my coffee and read my manuscripts in peace!)Once finished, I could feel the hovering presence of the waiter, expecting me to pay and leave. Seeing as the wall was my beautiful scenery for the meal, I was unable to tell if the main dining area was full. As I felt I had just as much as I could handle for one meal, I paid and exited the cafe. Upon leaving I noticed, much to my dismay, there were three free tables in the main area; all capable of holding more than 3-4 people. Now that I've just rambled on about the service, I'll leave a few lines for the food. To be honest, not much to say really. Good halummi and humous sandwich (though to be honest it was primarily spinach with three pieces of halummi and a thin layer of humous) and the coffee was satisfactory. In the end, I left less than impressed, and with slim chances of every returning. Bah humbug.",

Uber-cool media types tend to pop in here for a quiet drink and chat or a hearty breakfast.The cafe offers sandwiches, smoothies, salads and the traditional English fry-up, which I chose to have this time. The eggs were on the good side of runny, toast chunky, baked beans plentiful and I washed this down with a mint tea. My friend Kate, also had a fry-up with fresh orange-juice. You get a lot for your money here, given the location and the staff are friendly and very polite. The atmosphere is very relaxed and I would definitely recommend the cafe to people who just want a chilled atmosphere to catch up with a bunch of friends on any given day. It tends to get very busy during lunchtime however, it's pretty much expected given its popularity.",

While I'll agree with the other yelpers that it's not the most delicious, amazing breakfast you've ever had, for London standards, it hits the spot.Come here if you want a hearty, greasy brunch that is sure to give you food coma afterwards.I came with a friend on a Tuesday morning. It wasn't too crowded and the service was fast and friendly (keeping in mind that service in London tends to be abominable, this might be one of the few times where I was happy with it). I ordered the Scrambled Eggs and Salmon, which was so big that I pretty much passed out afterward. Had the Mango Go smoothie too, which was okay, but you won't miss much if you didn't try it. My friend had the Pancakes with fruit-- came as a stack of 4. I had a bite and actually liked it (though if you're a fan of only the light fluffy kind, I can see how you wouldn't like it). Would definitely come back :)",

    "text": "I love pancakes (and I don't mean crepes. Well, I love crepes too, but in a different context. This time, I mean the thick, puffy, carby discs, doused in maple syrup, that are apparently not called 'pancakes' anywhere else in the world but North America). Despite the fact that I rarely eat pancakes, I have been craving them for, now, five months -- a craving so long and miserable, yet so decidedly ignored until today.After waiting outside of the nearby Apollo Theatre for nearly three hours this morning (look out for my review of that, which will come shortly after I see a show there tonight), some friends and I decided that we deserved a hot, filling breakfast and a very large caffeinated beverage. Two clicks on the Yelp app later, and a short walk down Berwick Avenue, and we arrived outside of the bright yellow, exceedingly friendly-looking establishment that is the Breakfast Club Soho. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a very smiley, hipster server (how do these things go together? cannot compute) and immediately shown to our tiny-and-squashed-in-a-corner table. To be fair, since the restaurant would make a hobbit hole look like Versailles, all of the tables are shoved in some sort of corner, and are awkwardly close to one another. We were then approached by an even smilier, multiply-facially-pierced and heavily tattooed server (everything I've known about trendy people has been a lie) to get our food and drink orders. Since a few of us had a difficult time deciding amongst the menu's numerous brunch favorites, such as huevos rancheros, breakfast burritos, eggs benedict, and more, the server took time to give recommendations/explanations and point out which dishes she liked best. As I said before, with pancakes on the brain, there was no question about what I was getting. Hence, I ordered the Ham so Eggsited (and boy, was I) -- pancakes with cheddar, ham, and a fried egg -- but switched out the ham for some hash browns. I wasn't expecting what came next, but I'm not sorry it did. Sooo, very, completely un-sorry. The cheese (and I'm assuming the ham, normally, as well) was slapped between each of the three pancakes, and melted to perfection with residual heat. The fried egg was artfully placed on top, with the yolk running everywhere. Lastly, this magnificent delicacy was placed in a golden pool of maple syrup, soaking in all of its sweetness (and high fructose corn syrup). Oh, and the hash browns (which are really home fries, as Jenn mentioned below) were served in a dish on the side. BUT I STILL PUT THEM ON THE MAPLE SYRUPY PLATE ANYWAY (clearly, living on the edge). The resulting combination was the perfect mixture of savory and sweet, crispy and fluffy, sticky and smooth. It was a party in my mouth. No, actually, a full on rave.This meal, which could have easily fed two, along with my Americano, was \u00a310 exactly. I have spent more than that at one go on packets of M&S biscuits and Percy the Pig sweets. While I couldn't afford to eat like this every day (both for the sake of my bank account and my arteries), I'd say it's a pretty good value for money. And it scratched my nearly half-year pancake itch, so there are no complaints here.Go to Breakfast Club Soho! Will check out the Hoxton and Angel locations soon to compare awesomeness levels.",

Especially if you have a party of 3 or more as most of the tables are for 2. We went at about 11am on Sunday since nothing opens in London til about 11/12 but wished we went at 9 when it opened as the queue had about 6 people before us and from what I could see through the window everyone had just started eating! Anyway went back the next day and got a table no problem. The decor is very kitsch and 'cluttered' with mismatched tables and chairs and with only about 9 or 10 tables in the cafe it is certainly small! Ordered orange juice, pancakes, granola and a full monty breakfast. Yes the food takes a while to come which I actually quite like as you can tell it's cooked to demand. The orange juice was freshly squeezed too. Portions are very large! It took 3 people to finish off my granola with yogurt and berries as it was so big! Pancakes came with fresh berries, yogurt, and a little pot of maple syrup (I hate it when places pour the syrup on the pancakes as they just soak it up instantly and the pancakes taste dry) Full Monty breakfast had 2 fried eggs with runny yolks and big doorstopper slices of bread along with beans, sausages, bacon etc I would say very good value for money especially for the portion sizesPancakes were just under \u00a35, Granola was \u00a34 and Full Monty was \u00a38 Definately recommened just be prepared to wait!!",

    "text": "A great place for any time of day, not just for breakfast! The eclectic decor, great food and location are just right for a either a mid-shop lunch for those who start early, or a meeting spot for those who don't often see the morning!! And the fact tht it doesn't do alcohol makes it the perfect get away spot for the morning after the night before for those of us for whom the hair of the dog is more hinderance than help!Food is wholesome, filling, tasty and cheap (ie amazing!) and the service is always very friendly, if not always totally on the ball I also have had to chase up drink orders in this joint!A regular haunt wrapped up in pretty paper and tied with a bow. With bacon.",

They have nice yoghurt pots and freshly squeezed juices and smoothies. I get coffee from here somtimes. This branch is much cosier than their newer Islington location. Here you'll find couches and benches to relax and enjoy the free wi-fi.",
