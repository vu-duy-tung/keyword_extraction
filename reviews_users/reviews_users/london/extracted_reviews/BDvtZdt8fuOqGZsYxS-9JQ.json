But beware my male colleagues had to get seconds because it's really not enough to get full, so it might be too expensive if you have a big appetite. I also commend their decor: modern, stylish and minimalistic, it's a great place to bring down-to-earth clients who appreciate good quality food and design. Can't wait to come back here!",

While they do have a decent amount of seating, they certainly cater to the Itusu/Wasabi/Abokado lunch crowd (though admittedly more interesting and tastier). And quite frankly, the food is more suited to a lunch crowd-- even if you're eating in, you pick your beverages/salads/sides from a refrigerated case, then order from the counter then sit down.Can you tell I came here for dinner and was left a bit wanting?It was really good. I wish it were near where I work because it would be an ideal lunch: flavourful, light, healthy, quick.For dinner, however, I would have had to spend quite a bit of money to be sated, and at that point, I might want a proper sit down sushi restaurant. 4-stars for lunch, 3/2 for dinner.",

Places where the temaki culture is huge or rapidly growing. So if you are interested in trying these amazing sushi cones, I would definitely recommend Yoobi. Great atmosphere, excellent and fresh ingredients and a very nice temaki menu. A menu that goes from simple to deluxe options and that shows that they thought about it and tried to take it a step further with their temaki creations. What can I say more? Elaborate and delicious temakis!",

The flavours were good, and as you may know, i looooove myself some sushi on any night ending in a '-y'. I kinda preferred the maki which all their temaki comes alternatively in because you can share it, but everything was still really good.My only bugbear was that perhaps the rice was overcooked(?) because it was a little too \"squidgy\",but heir Miso was wonderful and I can see myself coming back :)Staff were friendly and I loved the presentation of everything.

I've also had the 20-hour cured salmon and some of the specials - the Philadelphia and the King Crab - all good choices. And now, they also have mochi ice cream dessert! They list about 20 different flavours, and when we were there, they were sadly out of most of them, but the toasted sesame and frozen yogurt ones that I did have were delicious.

    "text": "The freshest darn Sushi in town!!Of course the independent sushi bars always trump the chains..Stand alone Yoobi specialises in Temaki- hand rolls which have been inspired by the large Japanese population in Brazil oddly enough! The sushi cones are surprisingly filling and very reasonably priced (\u00a33.20 for a simple hand-roll). I would probably have two for lunch and be pretty stuffed!The staff here are always so accommodating and make you feel part of the Yoobi family. Almost makes you not want to leave :)The service here is incredibly speedy, perfect when you are on a tight lunch break and not to mention on a diet and want to avoid the dreaded fast food chains..I would recommend the spicy tuna and tuna tartare Temaki and finish off with the epic ice cream Mochi!Definitely pop in if you want a quick, delicious lunch that won't leave you feeling sluggish to power through the rest of the day..girlyvsfood.tumblr.com",

I can't decide.Yesterday was exactly one of those days. Decided to have a pre-dinner meal, as you do. I ordered the fresh wasabi tuna, citrus salmon, tuna tartare and salmon sashimi. All were A-OK, it wasn't phenomenal by any stretch, but it eased the craving, even if just a little and their flavours do work together very well. Their ingredients are fresh, from what I can tell. No complaints.Except one. There's always a complaint. Haha. The soya sauce, I don't know why and how people source this soya sauce, but it's the same one that they serve in your M&S sushi or any wretched sushi, it's a heavy soya sauce which is too salty and leaves a slight bitter taste. Stop it, please. It kills anything and everything good. The temaki is sufficiently flavoured and so I don't use it for that, but it ruined the sashimi for me. =(",

    "text": "I really love Yoobi. Don't expect sushi rolls or nigiri in the traditional sense though, the attraction of Yoobi is their speciality: Brazilian-influenced hand rolls.Done up in seaweed cones full of rice and awesomeness, each temaki I have tried has been perfect. Spicy tuna has a great level of heat. Citrus salmon is my favourite, with a wonderfully zingy mayo blending with the fresh fish and crunch from croutons and green-as-can-be salad. I've also tried the 20-hour cured salmon, which includes some asian pear to really add some freshness and texture, making it quite distinctive from the other dishes. You can get the same menu in roll-form if you so please, but I prefer to leave that style for the traditional Japanese delicacies; besides the temaki feels a bit different.Yoobi also does sashimi boxes as well as simple desserts, sides, and soups; though I am yet to sample any of these. They have Brazilian \"Guarana Antarctica\" in cans if you feel the need for a caffeine hit whilst you're in there; otherwise the usual drinks are available on top of a help-yourself water station.With 3 categories of temaki each containing varying levels of complexity, it's easy to pick out the items you want. Service is friendly and food comes quick, and in a handy container if you order take-out. If you're sitting in, the restaurant has a lovely light feel to it; given the casual nature of the food and the service, it really fits. Yoobi is a little out of my price-range for lunch, as I tend to be hungry enough for 3 rolls, which will cost you around \u00a310 depending on your order. Still, it is good value, tasty, and different, which can only be applauded!",

The temaki rolls are made fresh when you order, so they don't have the plastic-ky softness that pre-wrapped ones do - even the places where they're wrapped in the morning I find the rice tends to soak into the seaweed wrap.Fantastic miso as well. Great for a short, sharp stop-off with great quality sushi to boot. \u00a0I go for the Scottish Salmon every time as I like clean flavours, but there's lots to choose from on their small but perfectly formed menu.",

What even is that.Partner ended up waiting for everything to be made which defeated the whole purpose of ordering in advance.Salmon was good, but not great. Tuna was forgettable. Yes, the temaki are big--but they're stuffed with more rice than filling, to a huge degree, as are the rolls. It makes for an unbalanced mouthful.Up side, their rice was of good quality, but I felt like the price and flavour didn't actually meet in the middle.",

The Citrus Salmon and the Spicy Tuna temakis have been my favorites thus far, although the Scottish Salmon is really tasty as well. It's also nice to see that the fish they use is all sustainably sourced!Will continue to order from Yoobi in the future.",

Quite a few large chains have stopped stealing tips as a result. If they don't change, they deserve to go out of business as customers stop spending their money at places who rip off the customer and rip off their employees.Please do not eat at this restaurant until the owners publicly state they have changed their policy and staff will get the service charge that is added to the bill.

That is very surprising as the place was rather empty and the staff were not busy at all. We ordered two hand rolls and sashimi. The two hand rolls were brought over with no napkins, wasabi etc. These are small portions and go down quickly. After waiting a while we asked where the sashimi was. A little later, we were served with food that we didn't order. That was then taken away. Finally about 40 minutes after initially ordering (food that requires no cooking), we got the sashimi and the two hand rolls (again!!!). The wasabi and dipping bowls came later, in a reverse of the regular order of the universe. After complaining to the manager he apologised and discounted the bill so I'm giving it two stars for trying to correct their errors. Still I would rather they train their staff to pay attention to orders. The food is fresh but expensive for the small quantity you get.",

They specialise in temaki rolls, but you can chose your base option (3 types of salmon, tuna, veggie options, etc.) and then pick between temaki or maki rolls, if sushi-cones aren't your thing. I've ordered a citrus salmon temaki (delicious, also topped with tiny croutons), a seasonal miso soup and a set of salmon sashimi. The temaki and the miso soup were the best I've had in a long time, though the sashimi was fridge-cold which is really the only fault I could think of about this place.

    "text": "Simple yet satisfying, Yoobi is the type of eaterie that I wish I worked next to; for their signature Temaki rolls are a good value and charismatic treat that I could easily gobble up. Food is served quick, clean, appealing to look at and super easy to consume. I had the spicy tuna Temaki roll as was specifically recommended by a friend. The seaweed roll was noticeably crispy and fresh in taste and texture and it is well balanced with the quantity of its sticky rice and tuna contents. There is a spicy sauce that gives the roll it's 'kick' (thankfully not wasabi). I also tried the Tiger Prawns and Yellowtail Maki rolls, which were beautifully put together with chilli flakes or black seeds evenly sprinkled around each roll. With these I found the filling itself to be a bit lacking in flavour and substance but they were still pleasant bites, especially alongside the traditional soy sauce and wasabi combination with a small side of pickled ginger.\u00a0The drinks were uniquely authentic too, as the Aloe Vera with honey drink is from a Taiwanese bottle and is refreshing with a the usual aloe vera bits but no unnecessary addition of sugar whilst the Guava juice seems freshly bottled with a subtle guava pulp.In short Yoobi is more simple than plain and more noteworthy than forgettable; a decent place to visit for a quick Japanese pit-stop. I do wish it had a bit more variety on the menu but what it does offer is commendable. I would rate it 3.5 stars if I could.",

Between the two of us we ordered two sets of makis and three temakis with mochi dessert at the end and it came to \u00a345. If you're looking for real sushi this isn't the place but it's good for casual meal.",

Yoobi is my favorite!They've started offering table service in the evening which is sometimes a bit awkward, but generally pretty good. The food remains, as ever, delicious. 20 hour cured salmon with the pear slices = delightful. My standard order is some variation including the spicy tuna (which, depending on who mixed up the spicy sauce on that day can be warmly spicy or blow your head off awesome) and the citrus salmon. Citrus salmon is decidedly my favorite temaki offering. It's bright and fresh and light and just delicious. I have once had the special king crab California roll temaki, and it was super yummy, but that one is just a touch pricey for my wallet to be eating on regular basis when I am perfectly happy with the amazing salmon options.Giant handrolls, friendly service, and it's easy to fill up a stamp card if you come even sort-of often! So so good.",

I fell in love with Yoobi, and I still think about it today.In the middle of Soho, I walked past this strange place a few times. Hand rolled sushi? Why?Being a sushi-vore, my friend Martina and I decided it was definitely worth giving it a go.The place is cosy and clean, and most of the dishes are prepared in front of you at the work station.Their speciality is hand rolled sushi. You chose the filling, you chose the format, and you enjoy. They recommend 2 rolls if you're hungry, 3 if you're starving. I went for 2.I stayed relatively traditional: one with tuna and avocado, another one with salmon. And some Green Tea Mochi for desert. It did not disappoint.The fish was super fresh, and the recipe just worked. The rice was not crunchy, and perfectly seasoned.Om. Nom. Nom.Perfect lunch. When can we go back?",

Its a hand roll place, so if you want regular sushi bites you can have that too but its a little bit more expensive. \u00a39.00 (regular sushi bites) vs. \u00a36 (hand roll). I had the spicy yellow tail and it rocked my world so I had to have 2. Yes 2. Don't judge me. I was hungry. Plus the Unagi special roll. Yum town. I tried someones veggie soup and i gotta say, holy crap that was good. Miso soup but with a lot of veggies and tofu. It was really lovely. They have a lovely lemongrass and ginger infusion tea concoction that was really nice. Great service, plenty of space, great for last minute plans for a group. The food was really lovely.",

First off, they put broccoli in the miso soup. Huh? Very weird and somewhat off putting. Don't get me wrong, I love broccoli, but in miso soup? Not the right taste/texture combination. The edamame had so much salt on it that I had almost a full plate of salt left over after shaking off all the edamame beans onto it.",
