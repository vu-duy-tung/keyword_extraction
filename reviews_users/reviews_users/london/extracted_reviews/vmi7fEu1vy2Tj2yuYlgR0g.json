My last visit involved me revising a booking upwards for a Saturday night with only two hours' notice, but there was no hint of it being anything other than a pleasure. On arrival, I discovered that my European guests had arrived over an hour early due to a time zone mix-up but they'd been looked after really well. If anything, the waitress was more concerned about them maybe being stood up rather than them arriving too early. Food here is top notch. The 'Ottoman's Feast' set menu gives you a great selection of hot and cold mezze, which we'd have happily eaten as a meal in itself. The mains of various succulent meats are lovely. If you've got any room for the desserts, they also hit the spot. Lovely atmosphere, lovely food, lovely service. You really can't go wrong here.",

I love the decor and the setting, the pretty ribbons on the napkins and the freshly baked bread. I was introduced by a Turkish friend of mine, and have been going back ever since. In fact, I rate it so highly, I'll only ever take my really good friends there because it's not just for anyone!The starters are all really good, I like Kisir and Iman Bayildi and I like the mixed grill for the main. The main course portion is just huge and because I go for the special lunch menu which has lots of little samples of the starters, I can never finish my main. All the food there is just really good and so is the service. They have quite an extensive wine menu and I've sampled their non-alcoholic cocktails which are lush as well as the mint tea which they pour the proper way..(with the long drop).",

This is a Turkish restaurant with a lot of class and style, in both the ambience and the food. Literally everything was presented amazingly well. And all the food had a mastery and a finish you rarely find. Some of the basics, like Lokum (Turkish delight), were done so well as to be almost unrecognizable. I ordered the Ali Nazik, which was lamb chops with a tomato/chilli salsa over pureed aubergine. The presentation was great, but the taste was out of this word. The lamb was cooked perfectly, the aubergine had a garlicky spiciness that was refreshing, and the salsa was right on the money. For dessert... (I am just salivating writing this), I had apricots, rolled in pistachios, stuffed with clotted cream. And get this... where one normally would expect a pit... there is instead a walnut. So it's like \"oh crap, there's a pit, can't bite through there... oh wait... YES I CAN.\" I absolutely have to come back to this place.",

Our meals came out at the same time in a proffessional manner with two waiters . At the bill time we were presented with a gorgeous plate of turkish delight [the real stuff] \u00a0 Its a bit expensive \u00a0here with a main averaging 15pounds but you can also get the mezze dishes for 5 and 6 pounds each. The wine list has everything you could want spirits, cocktails, mocktails, champagnes etc prices start reasonable and go to the top end \u00a0All water is available but we had tap which I like and I prefer to pay for wine not water.I love this restaurant its a bit posh but doesnt have to be. I think it would suit any occassion from an intimate date to a party of many , there is lots of room and a great ambience. some places you go to for just the food and some you go for a lingering dinner with company, \u00a0drinks and dessert with nice service and this is that place.",

Some may criticise me for going to a Turkish restaurant and ordering a rib eye steak, but no one would utter a word of disapproval when they saw what beautiful goods were placed before me to make my rumbling belly smile.... It was simply, wonderful. This accompanied by a gorgeous bottle of red wine made it one of the best meals I have eaten in a very long time. I also tried everyone's more traditional Turkish selections which were also yummy but the steak is to die for, it even converted a vegetarian for the evening! The only criticism of this place is that it is pricey, but its not surprisingly because of its location and the quality of the food, and as the saying goes 'you get what you pay for' and my goodness its worth it, I would pay twice as much for another steak just like that one.

We were immediately seated, a very good looking waiter promptly took drink orders and brought some really top notch bread. Warm, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, almost a foccacia like consistency. it was very difficult to stop gobbling up the bread along with the olives and oil that accompanied them. We got 2 appetiser a cold and hot meze - eggplant stew almost, and spicy garlicky Turkish sausage. Both excellent. For main courses we got the Lamb stew over mashed eggplant (mine!) just delicious. I was very curios how the mashed egg plant might be prepared...it is almost like babaganouj with more texture and minus the Tahini. Hubby got the Meatballs in a tomato sauce, it was incredibly delicious. Dad got the Monk fish and shrimp kebabs, I thought it was lacking in salt, the good looking waiter got me some zatar to sprinkle on it..I was happy. Mum got the Seafood stew which was out of the world. The portions are just right (read not American portions) even then I was way too full. We ordered dessert but couldn't eat it, had to wrap it to go! Mum had Turkish coffee (of which I had a sip) ...again very good.

From a very early age, this wee Flora lady loved her food - and contrary to popular behaviour of children her age, she loved trying new and interesting cuisines: Japanese, Nigerian, Caribbean, Spanish... the more strange veggies and spices the better. However she did not venture to eat Turkish food, as she thought that the only item on the menu was - wait for it - turkey. Poor Flora. If only she had gone to an amazing Turkish restaurant like Kazan where she not only could have tucked away in a seductive venue with golds and deep reds and magic, but she would have seen that the menu included everything from chargrilled minced lamb with kashar cheese, kirmizi biber, and king prawn, monkfish and scallops simmered with mediterranean vegetables. (And yes, you can guess why I ordered the Biber...) That's what I recently devoured. \u00a0And it was pure divinity.Poor poor Flora. (She'll be happy to know that no turkeys were harmed in the writing of this review.)",

The sweet chili sauce that came with it was perfect. \u00a0The combination of flavors persuaded me to ask the chef what he used as his base for the sauce. \u00a0Luckily, he told me, now I just need to figure out what else he added to it. \u00a0This calamari was leagues above fish! \u00a0If you want excellent calamari, this is the place. \u00a0Both main courses were cooked to perfection and flavorful. \u00a0My only issues with the dish were that the salad and fries were not seasoned at all. \u00a0If they just take the time and season both sides, it would immensely elevate the dish and probably attract more customers. \u00a0The ingredients they use are already fresh and you can tell but to further set themselves apart from others, they need to do something about those sides. \u00a0I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but I couldn't because of the aforementioned issues. \u00a0I would definitely recommend this place and would come here again. \u00a0The staff were friendly, spoke relatively well English and the place accepts credit cards. \u00a0The d\u00e9cor of the place is contemporary.",

The sharing meze makes for perfect party food and the wine menu is extensive. But, and there is a but, there is something just missing for me. The food is mouthwatering i can't deny that, it's posh Turkish fair, but in Dalston you'll get treats just as tasty and authentic for less than half the price. Also for groups over 7 you have to leave card details, what's with that?I would totally go again, but just not tomorrow. Actually I've eaten so much I may not even eat tomorrow!",

    "text": "The May meeting of the supper club saw us 10 strong and headed to Ms Kelly's choice: a mid-week Turkish feast at Kazan. As we were a large party we were seated at very pleasant table downstairs where our neighbours consisted, in the main, of a few other largish groups. A nice enough space but if I was in a couple or a small party I would certainly have preferred a table in the upstairs room which was more appealing with a cosy but opulent feel. Despite being a mid-week night both rooms were full and there was a nice buzzy atmosphere throughout the restaurant. We kicked off with a round of cocktails while we had a look at the menu. My Pomegranate Mojito was a nice variation on a classic, well put together and pretty good value at under \u00a36. Plenty of choice on the menu, without being \"war and peace\", meant there was something to appeal to all our dietary requirements and quirks. To start we shared a few plates of the seafood and mixed mezze. These came with plenty of excellent bread which was much appreciated by our very hungry party. All the mezze were good and significantly better than many other Turkish restaurants in town. The smoked salmon was really very good indeed and the seafood plate would be my choice on a return visit. For the main course I had the Emperial Seafood Guvech which was a combination of king prawns monkfish and scallops in a tomato and white wine sauce which was served with giant bulgur. A well thought out marriage of texture and flavours, it was well executed and very tasty. Other mains seemed to go down well, although a couple of the party commented that some of the dishes were nothing out of the ordinary and a bit bland. Our end of the table were washing this down with well chilled bottles of Moko Black Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc; crisp and full of flavour this went very well with the fish dishes. The wine list had some good selections with plenty of choice under \u00a320. Service was quick, friendly and efficient and the staff were good at dealing with the \"demands\" of our very varied party. While not a cheap option, mains are around \u00a314 - \u00a315, this is a pretty good choice if you fancy something a bit different for your supper in the Victoria area. Probably would have got a 4 if I had been eating upstairs. If you are in the mood for a pre or post beer one of my favourite pubs The Cask is only a couple of minutes away and is very highly recommended.",

Desserts were surprisingly creative: rose hip ice cream, a vanilla custard, apricots stuffed with cream and pistachios, a small triangle of chocolate cake, all washed down with fresh mint tea. \u00a0Definitely try to save room for dessert!",

The evening meals, including a good range of mezzes, vary in price - expect to pay about \u00a330+ a head for dinner. Plenty of vegetarian options available. The service has always been very friendly, although it can slow up when they are busy, as well as getting a bit noisy. Great for a get together with friends, but lunch is a better bet for business.

We got a seat quickly even though the restaurant was packed.We ordered a starter each and wanted to have a piece of lamb that was labelled as \"two persons minimum\". We ordered that and the craziness started. The waitress had no idea how to deal with our order. She said that ordering one main course for two wasn't okay so we needed to order one each even though it was for two. She had no idea if it was coming with sides - it sounded unlikely given the price but there were no sides on the menu. After a while, her boss came to us and say that we were crazy ordering one piece of lamb each and we should share, as we wanted to do initially. Then, the waitress said that we can have chips or rice as a side. My friend took chips as the least bad choice and I insisted to get vegetables. At the end, we discovered that those sides were actually not included and we ended up ordering something we did not want.The service was simply HORRIBLE. One of the worst I had in a long time. The waitress shouldn't have been working there and following that experience, even if the food was good, I'm way less inclined to come back here. Sadly.",

This was posh, but the food very good, which in im opinion is always inverse, ie more posh, less quality. We ordered two mixed mezze platters, one of which was seafood. Then each ordered a main, mine was Adana kebab, which comes with rice/chips and salad. The other mains were Imam Biyaldi n lamb kofta. Excepting my hubby , he didn't like the Imam Biyaldi, which he thinks is way better in Green lanes , Stokey. The Adana kebab was delicious, succulent, juicy and well seasoned, though was expecting two kebabs instead of one. If you are very hungry, may not suffice. Also ordered Baklava with rose ice-cream which was also delicious. The baklava was almost Gaziantep standard with a delicious pistachio filling and not overtly sweet. The Lokum they served with the mint tea, was great too. 45 pp, with two bottles of wine, 2 cokes. Pricey, but in that location, to be expected. Would go back.",

I'm not a connoisseur of Turkish food, so I can't say exactly what it is, but it was similar to salsa - chunky, slightly spicy - I could have eaten it on its own. When we first arrived, the service was really impeccable and attentive, but as business picked up towards the end of our meal, I got annoyed at how rude our waitress was.

Both the cold and hot mezze were good. As for main, I don't think anything quite beat the Sultan's Shish Kebabs. Juice cubes of lamb grilled to perfection with rice and salad. If it is good enough for the Sultan, it is definitely good enough for me. I have friends who tried lamb cutlet and chicken and they all gave good reviews.

    "text": "Due to its Ottoman heritage, a lot of Turkish restaurants pride themselves in their roots and take on the challenge of serving 'Ottoman cuisine', which is a step higher than your standard Turkish cuisine. Since the Ottoman empire consisted of such a vast territory, it is only logical that it's cuisine is a melting pot of different influences, coming from regions such as the Balkans, Persia, Armenia, the Kaukasus, and the Middle East. Ottoman cuisine, in one word, is indulgence, getting a taste of what Sultan S\u00fcleyman might have felt like. Something like feeling quite like royalty when high-tea-ing, right? Kazan restaurant is highly accesible by public transport. It is located at the Victoria Tube station, so we easliy got there by public transport. It is the first restaurant that calls itself Ottoman,to actually being worthy of that description in terms of interior; the whole room feels so luxurious and exotic with its golden detailings typical Middle Eastern patterns. I had booked a table in the lounge, so we sat on a comfortable couch with embroidered cushions. The only minus here was that they had stuffed the tables so close to one another that you could practically look into one another's plate. Not that the food didn't look appretising enough foor that though... On to the food! As for starters I took kadayif prawns, which are king prawns, wrapped in phyllo, fried and served in paprika mayonnaise. And boy were they good! I am a huge prawn fan, but the only person in the world who always makes them good enough for my liking is my grandma. But Kazan restaurant managed to exceed my expectations: the prawns were juicy but still had a nice crunch to them at the same time. My husband was absolutely delighted to see they had 'Arnavut Cigeri', (Albanian liver), which you cannot find anywhere in Belgium (and which is even hard to find in regular Turkish restaurants in Turkey as well). and he was absolutely amazed at the quality of the liver. Liver apprently is not easy to cook, and certainly not in that exact typical way, but the way I understood it from his gestures, Kazan nailed that one as well. Main course then; my husband had Adana K\u00f6fte; which is strictly speaking not an Ottoman dish, but a typical Turkish one, to be found in many a Turkish snack bar. Yet, the preparation method was what set this K\u00f6fte apart from the rest, since according to my lyrical husband it was; 'Adana K\u00f6fte on a Gault Millault level'. I had a kuzu pirzola, which are lamb chops, and I have to say; I cannot remember the last time I have ever tasted a lamb meat so soft, and so full taste. The fries that were served with both dishes were excellent as well. (coming from two Belgian residents, that says a lot, no? ;)) As for desert, we both had a little assorted Ottoman dessert plate with a delicious piece of baklava, a chocolate piramid, and some rose ice cream. Of course, this is just a small look into what Kazan has to offer, since the menu is so extensive. I just have one suggesition for the Londoner, or those visiting London; come and have dinner here, you won't regret it!",

The environment is on the classy/high end side, with black walls and low lights.

You as a restaurant manager shall decide what do you want to be, and then STICK TO THAT IDEA, do not try to add tons of tables to a classy place or you'll just end up in losing clients on the long run.Me and my lady tried the ottoman feast, as it seemed to have most of the appetizers present on the menu and a mixed grillade.First thing, THIS IS NOT TURKISH: it's just a middle eastern restaurant, it has NOTHING TURKISH. Cold dishes includes olives, hummus, beet salad, other boring non turkish stuff. Hot appetizers, a sausage, samosas and a couple of other stupid things (including grilled cheese, seriously DAMN GRILLED CHEESE).Mixed meat, lamb chops koftas chicken wings and chicken breast.Finally dessert, baklava, chocolate and ice cream.IT HAS NOTHING FROM TURKEY. Those things just make me angry, if you want to be a turkish restaurant BE A TURKISH RESTAURANT, DAMN! no yogurt (do you know the term yogurt derives from the turkish word yogurt?!), no ayran, no soups, no pilav rice, nothing, NOTHING!!It's disgustingly FAKE and places like that SHOULD BE CLOSED BY AUTHORITIES!Ah and on top of that, the food is not turkish but it's not good either, I mean it's not bad, but there is no reason for paying that amount of money for such a stupid meal with boring things...Damn, YOU ARE IN MY BLACKLIST!",

The waiter was basically nonexistent, and we were hardly tended to. The vegetarian mezze were ok - the haloumi was grilled perfectly, and the red pepper-type spread was also delicious. Besides that, I thought things were too aggressively seasoned. For the main dish, I had the vegetarian shish. I have to say it was quite good - the feta was perfectly mild against the earthy vegetables, and the rice and salad were quite good, too. I felt the only thing lacking was that it could have used some cacik. I ordered a small side of it, and was brought the appetizer version for that same price. Overall, the food merits at least 4 stars, and the service about 2.5.",

Mains were the mixed Kaxan grill, not a disappointment and hit the spot. Just the 4 stars from me but will return",

For starters, the Falafel was crispy and tasty, and came with a creamy dipping sauce. The Baba Ganoush was also very good, served with bread. We also ordered the lamb and the \"Limon I-tavuk\" chicken (lemon & white wine sauce) which were both amazing! We were served rice and cooked vegetables (eggplant, peppers, and zucchini) with our meal. On our visit we had good service from a friendly staff. Street parking.",

Of course, the best pieces they give you only a small piece of but distract you with other decent meat that it's still worth it. It came with a salad that was not excited to be there. Fries even less so. That's why I'm giving it a 3. The hummus was good but I've had better back at home (which is an international city but not like London so that's another mark). However, it was pretty full for brunch and I liked the atmosphere. If you want to try Turkish food for brunch, then this was fun.",

The portions were good and the taste delicious. We shared a bottle of sauvignon blanc and finished the meal with dessert and coffee. The service was great and the room was pleasant and filled with light on the first sunny day of April. My only slight pause in not going for the full five stars was the size of the bill which, with service, amounted to nearly \u00a385 - which I felt was a pretty large amount for a mezze lunch.",

The starters were great, but let me tell you, the lamb was cooked IMPECCABLY, just right. They were hearty chunks grilled on the outside with a pink center, it was so tender and absolutely delicious. The chicken was also seasoned and cooked to perfection, I didn't know you could get so much out of chicken breasts.The meal ends with a small plate of complimentary Turkish delights, which I've never liked, but they were so good that I had two.Bottom line?

    "text": "This is a first class turkish restuarant in Victoria, I have been there with the family on a number of occasions and we have tried many of the dishes in the menu and they were all cooked to excellency apart from some exceptions.the restuarnat has three rooms, each one has its own decoration, with two of them using an Ottoman style decoration and the other using more usual design.Before going there it is worth making a reservation so that there are no unpleasant surprises, and asking about which room to book is also worthy.As I said, there are some exceptions for the quality of the food. Casseroles are below average, and Baklava is of a lower quality than what you might find in some local shops and it was the worst I have tasted in a turkish restaurant.Thier website currently shows a 50% discount if you book a table in thier branch in the city (but I haven't been there). and this restuant offers a take away menu (no delivery available). Prices are roughly 30-50% less than the price in the restaurant with the same portion sizes which is very good for someone who lives near by, as you might expect it doesn't offer all the items in the restaurant menu.",

I would strongly recommend the food, which is delicious and is great for both veggies and meat eaters. I found the service really good (particularly the Sir Ben Kingsly look-a-like waiter) but it is quite relaxed and unrushed, which may not suit everyone. Expect to pay about \u00a325-30 per head with wine.",
