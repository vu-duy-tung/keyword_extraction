Reasons to love this place:1. \u00a0It is in a very interesting little spot that is easy to miss, if you aren't really looking. This makes it a \"find\" for a non-local visitor like me! Just across the street from Liverpool Station....still sort of hard to see - Clue: It is right by KFC.2. \u00a0It is open 24 hours.3. \u00a0Full and very diverse menu - \u00a0and everything is available at any time.4. \u00a0You get great food for a very reasonable price.5. \u00a0The service is good, and they turn the tables quickly ( at peak times there is a line....but it moves pretty quickly. )6. \u00a0Eyes Right, and you see the kitchen, and the people cooking for you - I like that!So far on our visits we have had: Eggs Benedict - awesome, cooked perfectly, very tasty. \u00a0Also, the traditional English Breakfast - complete with baked beans - interesting and good! And my son ordered the Bacon & Cheese sandwich - nice portion of lean bacon with melted cheddar cheese...I'm Jones'in for the Eggs Benny now, as I write this review...",

    "text": "24 hour goodness at an affordable price... shall I go on?This used to be one of my locals, and an absolute favourite despite not actually servicing alcohol... it was more like Polo Cafe at the time, and almost had an old school feel to it which I loved.Alas, a massive refurb has happened... mostly for the better, although I do miss the old vibe. Above said, for all intents and purposes this has become even more of a 24 hour treasure by most standards as they now serve alcohol and have far more seating than they used to. The service is friendly, but can be a bit sporadic depending on how busy they are and perhaps not as attentive as when you were all stuck in a small space, and the breakfast food is perfect for those late night fixes. I'm sure they serve other things, but to be honest I've always gone for late night/early morning breakfast which doesn't really disappoint given the hour and price... they do all the standards, including poached eggs, etc. I suppose it says something that I'm looking forward to a 24 hour tube service so I can find myself here on some weekends now that it's no longer my local... sure there are late night takeaways, McDonald's, and even the elusive Duck and Waffle, but my claim is staked squarely in the middle here. Four stars because it's not \"epic\", if it were a standard 9-10pm place it would be a different story, but make no mistake this is personally a 5 star place for me as it is.",

    "text": "We ordered a hot chocolate and a vegetarian breakfast that had these really nice sausage shape things with vegetables and other things in them, it was really tasty.the hot chocolate was great as well and it seemed kind of cheap too maybe. Have you ever been here, literally open 24 hours when we went in we ended up sharing a table with some other people.One of these was a man with his girlfriend who might not be his girlfriend much longer, because as we were about to leave he started saying things like 'You only tell me you want to break up in the middle of (swear word) Liverpool Street at 3 in the morning' and other things like that. The woman didn't say much, I think she might be a bit scared of him but I don't know. she had a black eye. \u00a0When they first sat down the man said 'is she sleeping' (referring to my friend) and 'why is she so tired?'.He stopped talking for a bit then looked at the table and said 'did someone just eat breakfast?' and pointed at our plate. He said some other things.Another man came in and asked if he could sit opposite me.He started talking to man no 1. I got a newspaper from a shelf and looked at it. I started doing a crossword because I thought it might dissuade them from engaging me in conversation but I could feel man no 2 staring at me as I did the crossword. Man no 2 had bought two different meals and mixed them together.Man no 1 said to the man that was sitting opposite me: \"Hey man I'm waiting for some friends, do you mind if I have a bit of that\". he pointed at man no 2's food. Man no 2 looked at him like, are you serious and said \"nah man I can't do that, I can't do that\" and looked at his food. Man no 1 looked away and started talking to his girlfriend. Man no 2 said \"I can't do that\" again quietly. Feel like Man no 1 was testing to see if he could get some food for free but it didn't work.I could feel Man no 2 staring at me or my lap where I was doing the crossword. I thought, 'crosswords bring people together' and felt dumb or like an advert. He did this for a long time then he said 'Damn, how'd you get so fine' and 'You just grew up like that, right' (he was definitely drunk)Man no 1 saw me doing a crossword and said, 'If you want to know someone that can do those, its her' and pointed at his girlfriend. He said 'I mean it, she's the one you want, so if you get stuck, just ask her, she can do them'. No one said anything for a while, Man no 2 ate his food. Man no 1 seemed to be ignoring Man no 2. Man no 2 finished his food and said things about the crossword I couldn't really hear. he repeated himself a lot and I heard \"Don't get stuck on that one crossword trust me\" or something like that. \u00a0Man no 2 said 'OK I'll leave you alone if that's what you want me to do' waited for a bit, said \"No?\" then, \"OK I'll leave\". He shuffled out. Eavesdropping 101, after Man no 2 left, it seemed like Man no 1 was trying to start an argument with his girlfriend. It got to 4 am and we left.",

My friend, who consumed the entire toxic dish, was even worse off, vomiting multiple times over the course of a single Eurostar trip to Paris. She still has not fully recovered.This was the worst meal I have ever experienced in London. I am shocked that a well-known establishment like this one could have such low standards of quality control. I'm also embarrassed that I brought my unfortunate friend here for a meal, which poisoned her.Polo Bar should be ashamed of themselves for serving a fish so bad that a mere two bites could poison a customer so thoroughly as to completely incapacitate them for three days.

I am not qualified to speak on that, obviously, but I FELT it, I really did. Or something else, perhaps. Read on, help me out:Old and new? The young immigrant night-shift servers chatting loosely, labouring in the harsh-lit stuffy flimsy soulless classic forgettable-period interior, oppressed by weird dull early-20C soggy big-band vaguely patriotic standards. It's the owner, music-wise. That's what they tell me. He's got a notion of something that doesn't exist, it seems, and so insists on the period tunes. The result is not good. Stark yellowlit nighttime post-alcohol oasis manned by 20-something continentals with [insert corny old English composer's name here for perfect sentence] lilting out of the speakers. I love it.Good and bad? The familiar enshrined English breakfast, teetering on the edges of delicious and despicable, the intensely chemical-salted bacon stroking a craving with almost gagging intensity, the egg pleasant enough, oil-greased but thankfully not oil-drowned, the beans a touch dilute but not tragic, inducing palatal acceptance as a starchy counterpoint, the sausage of strange loafy texture beyond nomenclature but thoroughly, shockingly, satisfying to both mouth and stomach. It's hearty and filling and completely indecipherable by the gastric apparati: some straddling of immiscible good and bad, there is no middle ground. I can hear in my head (it's 2:30am, post-alcohol, OK?) the spectres of drunkards and tourists and bearded old men through the ages offering every sort of pronouncement on this meal. It's not what it could be. But is it what it, like, should be? Uh. \u00a0I don't know. I feel alternately queasy and sated. An insomniac's angular fluorescent haven in a sleeping city, is this place real? Have I eaten a physical meal or just ingested an uneasy part of some collective dream-conscious? I half expect to shuffle out onto cold Bishopsgate and glance back at a shuttered shopfront. Hm. Well, I don't look back but DO retreat into extracorporeal over-ear Beach House from an upper-front-left night bus perch. Let the stomach make its pronouncement in the morning.",

I called back and was able to place my order after I was transferred to someone else because the woman didn't want to take my order (I know this because I heard her in the background refusing to take it.) when I finished placing my order I was told that it would be ready in 10 minutes. I had a train to catch so I needed it to be ready when I arrived. I got to the general area but couldn't find the restaurant so I called again and was yelled at instead of just explaining to me where the restaurant was. Once I found the restaurant I went inside only to find out that the cook had no idea that there was a pick up order placed and the food hadn't even been started. At this point I was a bit upset and really didn't have any more time to waste. The lady at the register said she would start the food now but wouldn't start it until I paid even though she wouldn't tell me when it was going to be done and I told her that I was in a rush. All in all, I would never go to or advise anyone to go to this establishment due to the aggravation and hostility I received.",

We really enjoyed our meal here. The only tough part is that I think the restaurant is somewhat \"narrow\" meaning its a tight space spread over three floors. We were brought up three flights in order to get to our table. Not a problem is you are mobile but if you had any sort of mobility issues, this would be a difficult place to navigate. The bathrooms were very antique-y and had pull string flushers (so funny). The only thing that made me uncomfortable was that there were blinds to cover large windows to the bathrooms/toilets. I could kind of look out and see the communal sinks outside...this made me somewhat paranoid that others could see in. But it certainly was not the end of the world. Considering this is a 24 hour restaurant (reminds me of what a New Jersey diner might be like in London) I think this was a great little spot to have a really hearty English breakfast.",

They have a heat lamp in the back which is great since the front door stays open. Had a flat white coffee and the vegetarian breakfast. Very hearty. I needed to charge my phone and there are many sockets. Ordered a black coffee as I waited. Sat for nearly two hours total eating and having coffee.

Why not!?You could nearly miss it completely, with its tiny shop front on imposing Bishopsgate (it's right opposite Liverpool street station). \u00a0However, the inside is somewhat of a tardis and has 3 floors of super-cool subway tiles and old-school diner decor.The food is delicious - I opted for a philly cheese steak sandwich and my partner for eggs benedict. Both were delicious, and great value for money! \u00a0The service was mega friendly and relaxed, so they're happy to let you do your thing, without being hassled or feeling the need to top up your drinks ever half an hour. On the downside, however, I paid \u00a33/4 for a freshly squeezed apple, lime and spinach, which came in a tiny glass, smaller than a half-pint (in my pics). I don't think that was very good value.So, you ask, why have they lost one star...?It's the atmosphere. Given the positioning on a busy street, this place should be heaving all of the time, but it was Saturday night, and we were one of two tables in (I didn't check upstairs, however). It could be the fact that they insist on playing dance music at a high volume at night (I'm here to hang out, not dance! I don't want to have to shout), therefore you can only have a conversation at one or two of the tables on the ground floor. Who knows? It's not exactly a hipster haven, though.All in all, i was pleasantly surprised and I would certainly go again! Perhaps in the day, this time, to see if they've turned down the music...",

We sat in the upstairs section of the bar and it was excellent. The menu is American Diner style as is the decor, but not in a naff over the top way. The menu has a range of burgers, hot sandwiches like philly cheese steak (yum) , omelettes, breakfast food and loads of different types of fries with toppings like bacon and cheese.I had the fish finger sandwich, great value at 5.50 and stacked high with hot fish and salad. The sweet potato fries were brilliant, so much so we ordered more. I tasted some of my pals food and it was all pretty good. There was a good selection of drinks including local craft beers and the one waiter upstairs could have not have been nicer. I was not expecting it to be so good and the food to be so fresh and tasty. Don't think you could find a better late night spot so reasonably priced with great staff. A winner and would definitely go back.",

Two floors of seating with a great menu selection of 'fast food' options including all day breakfasts, brunch, lunch, dinner, burgers and desserts. Literally no matter what time of day you could eat whatever food option you choose. They also have 'award winning pancakes'.Sadly I was only here for a coffee meeting today and in honesty the coffee wasn't that great but what I will say is I loved the overall vibe here and the staff - they were friendly, chipper and laughing and joking around which was a nice escape from the busy streets of the City of London.I'm definitely going to head back here for a late night meal. Any business that's 24 hours is fine by me and from the general Yelp hype it's definitely worth the visit.",

At night, the restaurant turns into a bar.I came here with a friend on a weekday afternoon and were seated within 10 minutes. The floor space is small but the restaurant has three floors. They seemed pretty booked out for lunch, luckily my friend and I were able to grab one of the last few tables on the third floor. We ordered from the all day brunch menu. I got the American breakfast seeing it was July 4th and I'm from New York, and my friend got the Lox bagel with scrambled eggs. It was pretty interesting to see an American twist to the traditional English Breakfast. In terms of flavors, both the American breakfast and lox bagel were alright. The scrambled eggs were smooth but could be more runny. The American breakfast was decent and came in a pretty big portion but the hash brown could be more flavorful and the pancakes could be fluffier (yes, the American breakfast comes with pancakes, and bacon too). Overall, ingredients were fresh but flavors could be refined but I'm not complaining because it wasn't expensive. The best part about the restaurant is probably the decor, it gave the restaurant a fun and energetic vibe. The staff however weren't too friendly (but we did come at peak hours. I probably wouldn't come back but I'll definitely think of this place when I'm out in the wee hours.",

It was a standard English breakfast offering, and was really not greasy at all. It wqas washed down with two cups of English breakfast tea. My othere diners when for an Omlette and a Bacon sandwich.

    "text": "Usually I rate a restaurant for its food and if I was, I'll give this place three stars because with the prices they're charging you can probably go to a greasy spoon and get something similar for a lot cheaper and probably includes a drink. But the reason why I'm giving Polo 24 bar a four is because there's actually a place in London that opens 24 hours a day, located conveniently and not charging the world like Duck and Waffle lets just say. Plus the place looks pretty cool, very odd mid century British cafe decor with weird taxidermies on the wall. Let's just say it would be very hard not to fit in as you will get the business people, the group of friends and the tired builders.Service is a hit and miss. Depends on who serves you, what day you rock up and of course, what time too. I usually don't care what service I get as I sympathise with anyone working through the night and maybe doing the occasional shift work. Half the time they don't seem to care about us either and ignore the fact we have entered and want a seat. Ha! Win win situation.Food is pretty standard. Nothing that particular wows anyone and can be a mix bag at time. Depending on what you get it usually comprises of lots of different things and there's usually two or three things that are right and one or two things that are wrong. So we turned up at 22:00 after exhausting ourselves over some petty argument and every restaurant kitchen was closing. Only this place springs in mind and cures our hunger.We were seated upstairs which had the lights dimmed for relaxation and ordered the following:English teaStandard Tea from PG tips served better than you'll have it at home which makes it more special. Tea was in a classic ceramic teapot and milk was served in a cute glass bottle. Somewhat makes it taste better.Hot milkThey serve hot milk without giving you a weird look. Told you you'll fit in ;)American breakfast My American breakfast consisted of sausages, bacon, two fried eggs, a grilled tomato, sweet potatoes fries, mushrooms, pancakes and maple syrup. It was a pretty awesome combination. Don't think I can find anything quite like it anywhere else. Of course if you took each ingredient apart you'll find it's pretty simple but very filling. Pancakes were a bit dense but mixed in with everything else it would do. The best part was the lovely baked sweet potato fries, crisp and sweet and the perfect thing to dip into my runny egg yolks.Sticky toffee pudding  Just the standard good old sticky toffee pudding. Everything about it was right from being moist to sticky. Served with custard which I wished had more but for presentation it was served in a little bowl. After you got your food you're pretty much left alone to talk and relax as long as you want. The waiters were pretty much doing the same. It's a cool place with three floors so you don't usually need to reserve. It's comfortable too and great for emergency hunger spikes. \u00a0Oh and they do good burgers too!",

We were in the Trading House and a city drinker overheard our despair. He told us about Polo Bar, a local late night food haunt over a couple of floors offering decent food into the early hours. Yes, our prayers had been answered. We headed on down to Liverpool Street and literally across the road from its entrance, there was Polo. You have options here, you can buy to go. Choose from massively filled hot dogs and much more, or you can get seated on one of the floors via a skinny staircase. We were put on the 2nd floor which already had other hungry revellers. We sat, perused the menu and were impressed with the offering although a little anxious about what would actually turn up to your table once ordered. Pranvera ordered ribs and damn they were big. This portion is not for the faint-hearted and even being hungry at this time of night, I think this is definitely a dish which could be shared. I went for steak which came with breaded mushrooms and onions on a pile of chips. Her ribs came with sweet potato chips and a gorgeous BBQ sauce. Considering this was quite late night, I was impressed with the standard of service and food. It was also not massively expensive to compensate for the inconvenient hours these poor folk have to work. I liked Polo and if I am ever in the area again in need of a twilight food injection, this will be my spot of choice.",

We all decided on some dishes from the menu, and one by one we were told the item we wanted was sold out, so we took another 10 minutes to decide on other items, and this time only half of the things we wanted were sold out, but then randomly were told the ribs we wanted to start off with were no longer sold out. We think it was just a miscommunication with the staff and the kitchen, but the food we got was all alright, but nothing to write home about. Solid place for late night eats, just dont come in with any high expectations as they may be sold out of your first and second choice.",

    "text": "It was my last day in London and I had not yet experienced the full traditional English breakfast.In the early morning hours, I was able to find Polo Bar, which was conveniently located near the hotel I was staying.The bottom level is an Italian bakery and while I was tempted to get a cannoli, I was here for breakfast.Now if by some chance you, my reader, are unaware of the concept of the full English breakfast, let me explain.The full English breakfast is a breakfast plate consisting of eggs, bacon, sausage, fried tomato, bread, and mushrooms. Sounds like a typical breakfast right? Well, the stuff gets deeper. The last few items baked beans and black pudding, make this breakfast unique to the UK.Once that plate was set down on the table I went straight for those baked beans. They are sweet and pretty much what I get from a can. Not necessarily a bad thing, but nothing unique here. Very simple molasses flavor. The beans are soft and break apart easily. Now, bite into that bacon. This isn't typical bacon, but more like Canadian bacon or a slice of ham in terms of thickness. Lacks the crisp, slight char and gratuitous saltiness of the beloved American bacon. Rather, this bacon is mild, soft and chewy. I enjoyed pairing it with the beans as they compliment one another. Salty, sweet, chewy, fatty. It's a crowd-pleasing combination. The sausage is a breakfast sausage so don't expect a juicy interior or satisfying snap. But it has a simple flavor profile, slightly grilled, greasy, savory and a little spicy. Also is a decent length, girth, and density, unlike other breakfast sausages that are mostly grease and filler. Bread is very crisp and slightly blackened. Thorugh and deep buttering. Butter has a nice creamy and cultured taste. The mushrooms are sauteed and have a chewy texture. Tomato is partially cooked and has a nice balance between that raw acidic tang and roasted sweetness. Semi-melted texture with some juices pooling underneath. Sunnyside up egg has a slightly rubbery white, but the yolk is is the perfect texture. Slightly thick and runny. I enjoyed coating the sausage in that runny egg yolk. But the egg does seem to be a cheaper egg as the white has a slightly rubbery quality. Either that or it was cooked too quickly...or maybe it was a lower end egg not given the love it needed to reach full sunnyside up potential. I saved the best for last. Black pudding was the gem of the meal. Has a nice bready texture with a sage undertone. No, it doesn't taste like blood, but there is a distinctly savory quality here. Soft and moist with some solid bits of grain. I really enjoyed the complexity here. Furthermore, it doesn't need to be paired with anything to enhance flavor. The full English breakfast does a good job of covering the food groups. The focus seems to be on savory and salty. Only sweetness comes from the beans, which is still kinda savory. Each item by itself is simple, but together as a whole it is a satisfactory experience.",

Friends enjoyed their meals as well. This was a great find for a late night eat.",

There was nothing open in the middle of the night where I was staying so I followed shady Google maps walking directions here. When I got here it was completely packed on the first and second floors. I was lucky to get a table. Later I found out this is across the street from the Aldgate tube station, which is probably better than wandering abandoned streets in 30-degree weather. The service was fast and the food came quickly. The bf and I both ordered burgers and chips. The burgers were excellent, however, I would caution against ordering the chili burger. The UK definition of chili burger (a burger with sliced jalapeno) is apparently not what it is in the US (a burger with a ladle of chili on top). \u00a0There are definitely a lot of travellers getting oddly timed meals in here. They offer breakfast foods as well as full plates, so there's something for everyone here at odd hours.",

On my birthday, my husband took me here for lunch, it wasn't at all busy so I was happy we got a table right away, there are three levels and a lot of steps but it was definitely worth it. Our server was a really nice man, he let us take our time while we looked at the menu, we were being the biggest tourist taking photos of everything going on. The decor is so fun, the huge British Flag in the window and hopefully a fake stuffed bear. I ended up ordering sausage and mash while Bryan ordered the Polobar Steak Supreme Burger with a side of chilli cheese chips. We were so excited to see chilli on the menu, little did we know they were going to sliced chillis! I laughed so hard, a little misunderstanding but really delicious either way. The portion size is huge, there was so much mash I couldn't finish it all! The food was so good and Bryan said it was the best burger he had the whole trip. After our food, we ended our lunch with homeade scones and clotted cream along with tea and a glass of bubbles. We also had a slice of carrot cake as my birthday sweet. It was wonderful and they really used cream cheese frosting which I am a stickler for. We chatted for a bit with another server while ours went home, she too was really lovely. We had wanted to Scotland and told us the best ways to get to the train station that would take us to our airport! She was amazing, I wish I had gotten her name! Thanks so much for the hospitality Polo Bar, we cannot wait to come back!",

The burgers are awesome and the American style greasy spoon to go feel is sparky. 3. The variety is a big draw with everything from classic fry up to 'Chorizo and Guac Eggs Benedict on a sweet potato base'!!!!The bad:1. I found their Vegetarian breakfast underwhelming with the bubble and squeak being cold and the hash brown (just the one) being definitely de-frosted without any crispiness or golden glow. 2. Service can be a little slow even when it's not that busy and unfriendly. 3. Bloody mary was very bland. Not impressed.

And while I'm not the biggest fan of heavy American food- being that I'm an American- it's actually pretty good. The fare from the hot dogs to the breakfast platters, which are served all day, are all great. The pancakes come in many different varieties, the drinks are plentiful, and the seasonal specials are always worth a try. Just know that it is very much diner food, and if you're used to surviving on salads and quinoa, this might not be the place for you. Given that it's near a lot of cool hangouts like the Sushisamba right next door and pubs galore, it's the perfect place to grab a late-night bite with your friends after all the other kitchens have closed.",

My husband had a full English breakfast with scrambled eggs tons of bacon, blood pudding, baked beans, scrambled eggs with bubble and squeak. I had bubble & squeak - kind like eggs Benedict but gorgeous poached eggs with stunning and tasty super orange yolks sitting on bubble & squeak (mashed potatoes with smashed peas...so good), delicious bacon and topped with an awesome Bearnaise sauce. Service was great. Coffee perfect. We even went back for afternoon tea and dessert. Too bad today was our last in London. It's right near Liverpool tube Station. Don't miss it",

OK was fine for midnight on the Sunday. The bacon with my pancakes was actually delicious, like most British bacon. The pancakes were overcooked and not hot, which was weird. They were like the pancakes I used to make when I was eight and couldn't figure out when to flip them. Maybe the Brits don't do pancakes the way Americans do. Maybe that's the way they are supposed to be.Thank goodness I could eat those pancakes with bites of delicious bacon.The green detox smoothie was also delicious; it's healthiness made me feel better about all the bacon.",

    "text": "One of the few 24 hour spot in London. It's pretty good and cheap! Actually, it's damn tasty. This was my second time eating here. I had the salt beef! It's seasoned well and ready in a hurry. If you're partying in Shoreditch/East London, come here after the club for some hearty drunk food. My only gripe is that they leave the front door open. So if you dine in and sit downstairs, you'll be freezing the whole time. Nonetheless, the food is worth it!",
