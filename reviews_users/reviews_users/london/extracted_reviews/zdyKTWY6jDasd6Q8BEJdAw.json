    "text": "Visited London this summer and was yelping good places to eat in the soho district and came across honest burgers. For a UK establishment, 4/12 stars and 92 reviews is pretty impressive seeing as yelp is not used as proximately as in the US. I ordered the honest burger and asked for it cooked medium but it still came out on the pink side. Now, i'm not in my native country so i'm not comfortable with things being undercooked but I decided to just go ahead with it anyways. The burger was tender and i liked the bun. It was nothing I hadn't had back in california, but overall still a good quality burger. The fries which everyone seems to be a fan of were too \"gingery\" for my taste. There is a definitely a strong taste of ginger.. and the lemonade was not very good either, didn't taste like real lemonade. Overall it was a decent meal but for 12 pounds, i would explore my options.",

The vibe is less LOUD CLUB BURGER TRENDY PANTS QUEUE FOREVER HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA and more hey, come, relax, have a burger. If they don't have a table, they'll take your number and call you. You can go to any nearby pub. There is no anxiety to get there at stupid o'clock for fear of having to stand outside to wait for your dinner as a sign of the restaurant's desirability.And even though we were told 45 minutes for a table, it took no more than 10. Which meant that I had to finish my lager VERY quickly, but there are worse fates in life.I'm still giving this five stars because it was really just so freaking enjoyable. The staff was great from beginning to end. Really friendly. It's cozy and unpretentious. There isn't f'ing paint and noise and fugly thrown all over the walls to look like, I don't know, an East Village basement metal bar? I don't even know what that decor is going for. Anyhooz, the beer is also good. I'm so glad there's an Honest Burger in Soho now. OH! And the fries!!! Those fries are incredible and deserve so many stars and kisses on their own.",

    "text": "On a never-ending (and incredibly tasty) quest for the best burgers in Britain, Honest Burger was inevitably going to be a stop. But when they were only down in Brixton serving up burgers in a seemingly perpetually crowded shop, I had a little hope of trying them out. Luckily, the new Soho branch is tucked away off Dean St and hasn't yet been noticed by the vast crowds who typically roam those streets in search of food.After a morning of intense training in Regent's Park followed by some highly entertaining shopping in the local charity shops, I popped into Honest Burger for a well deserved bite. I had the intention of trying out the namesake burger (bacon, cheese, and onions on an all-beef patty) but the cute waitress seduced me away with the special. This decadent dish was a black pudding and beef patty with a smoky brown sauce and a sweet apple tempura (which I initially thought was an onion ring!) served with HB's house chips.The burger was good with rich meaty flavours from the beef boosted by the black pudding. The black pudding supported the meat rather than hiding it but I'll have to try a standard beef burger there to really talk about the meat itself. Needless to say, it was a juicy tasty patty that I thoroughly enjoyed. The apple tempura was a new element for me and the sweetness of the apple helped balance out the richness of the patty. I'm not sure what exactly the sauce was, but it helped keep the patty moist and tied everything together. The bun was a win with the soft bread absorbing the sauce and juices although it did fall apart in the last few bites causing a small mess. Or maybe that was just me...I never seem to be able to eat without getting my hands a little dirty.I washed it all down with a delicious Samuel Smith Pale Ale served in massive bottles. I've never see Samuel Smith before (being much more familiar with Sam Adams) but a good brew for sure.Last, and definitely not least, were the chips. Wow...just wow. These are by far the best chips I've ever tried. Not just in Britain...I mean ever! And I've gone through Hawksmoor's beef dripping chips, Heston's triple cooked chips, and made dozens of variations on my own (what can I say...I love chips!). But after just one, you know why HB insists on serving a portion with each burger. Hell, I'd come back here just for the chips!So I probably should tell you why. These chips are imbued with rosemary. You can see the flecks of rosemary on each crispy wafer and you can smell it wafting out of the kitchen. It's amazing how good rosemary and potato tastes. The chip itself was crispy on the outside yet fluffy so fluffy inside to a degree that implied double or maybe even triple cooking. The full flavours of the rosemary made my mouth water and they were salted just perfectly. The bottle of ketchup provided was almost an insult to the quality of chip served.Overall, for \u00a312 for the burger and chips (normal burgers range from \u00a37-9...the special was \u00a312), it's an excellent value offering. On the burger alone, I'd give it the #3 spot under Patty & Bun and Kimchi Cult, but when judged as a package with chips it's definitely at the top.",

She suggested Honest Burger, saying that the Louisiana burger had been recommended. I'm always up for a good hamburger, so I was excited to give Honest Burger a chance.We got lucky, as we were able to get a table right as we walked in, though we were toward the end of the lunch hour on a Saturday. It's probably the kind of place where you should get a reservation if you can, or be prepared to wait. The Louisiana burger was no longer on the menu, but if I remember correctly, there was something involving chorizo and spiciness as the new 'seasonal' option, so I was glad to give it a chance instead. The burger was great--juicy and messy and rich in flavour. The rosemary fries were also delicious. We had water to drink, but there was a sumptuous lemonade that I saw at other tables and will definitely be giving a chance the next time I stop by.Service was good, and the atmosphere was quaint and funky. I liked all of the warmth and wood feeling--it was unique but not trying to be something fancy, just a good place for a good burger.",

Such is the way with London dining in 2013. Bah Humbug. But you don't fool me, I think you need to go the extra step to realistically be in with a shout of 4 or more stars if you're marketing yourself as some burger experience. GBK and Byron have been around for a decade and still are decent. Why do we need Honest Burgers? Is GBK's delicious Kiwi-burger secretly telling us lies and mugging us behind our backs?Why we need Honest Burger is revealed once you've had your first few bites sitting in the little restaurant. We need it because it's a worthwhile combination of good meat, chips, soft drinks and a nice family-feel atmosphere. Just make sure you don't go at a busy time.

From the time we enter all the good signs were there; the limited variety of different burgers (a sign that they are purists and they know that a good burger contains so many things), the default cooking for the burger that is medium \"pink\" (a sign that they are proud about their meat) and lastly the pace of the plates emptying all around us. I had the honest burger and it was as good as expected. A little disclosure: I classify a burger as great when a feeling of sadness comes along with the last bite. Here that was precisely the case, along with a feeling of certainty that for my rest couple of days in London I will revisit it for sure to keep the memory of this place as fresh and as pink as their burger was.

It is always a rare treat to be able to enjoy my meat patty with a bun when one has Celiacs.The ginger beer was very spicy yet sweet and enjoyed that it was served in a Mason Jar.The fries (chips) were full of a salty rosemary flavor and even though I was full I managed to eat them all. Also huge plus that the fries came with the price of the burger rather than having to order them separately.

The individual ingredients were not necessarily ones I tend to enjoy, and I've been to a fair share of burger places that don't believe vegetarians are within their target audience and therefore do not make an effort when it comes to vegetarian options. So, I was skeptical to say the least. Boy was I wrong. I would DIE for this fritter -- it was everything I wanted in a meal and more. Their fritters are also off the beaten path of vegetarian substitutes, which is always welcome. I would recommend the fritter to anyone with tastebuds, not just vegetarians. This is not something I think of as a \"passable substitute\" since I do not eat meat -- this is something I'd travel across the city to have for dinner (which I have done).The service at Honest Burgers was also well-coordinated, professional, and timely. The first time my friend and I ate there we were in a rush to see a performance, and despite the crowd the employees seated, served, and got the check for us in excellent time.

Bonus!I ordered the Honest Burger (cheese and smoked bacon) cooked medium-well. It was tasty, but to be 'honest' (see what I did there), it lacked that juiciness that you'd get from a Patty & Bun or Shake Shack burger. Their menu says they're cooked medium/pink unless otherwise requested, but I always have them medium-well, so the additional cooking time couldn't have dried it out.The thin rustic chips (skin on) with rosemary were surprisingly addictive...and a great big heap of them too. Everything was serving in a camping style enamel plate (not a fan!), but I guess its way better than just greaseproof-paper like the other trendoid burger joints.I'd give the burgers 3-stars and the chips 5-stars.",

    "text": "In the latest stop in my London tour of HB locations, I find myself in Soho. Pretty great, considering a few of my faves (wahaca, Bone Daddies) are also nearby. It's also a stone's throw from Burger&Lobster, so keep that in mind if you're given a two-hour wait like I've been both times I've tried going.On a Sunday evening, there was still a 30 min wait. Luckily, they employ their other locations' system of taking your phone number and texting you when your table is almost ready, and again when it IS ready (convenient if you've ordered a drink at a nearby bar and now need to down it and pay).I was perhaps a little too excited to try what I had come to believe was the greatest mash-up since Bowie and Mercury - the BrewDog burger. Spotted it on the menu, but I had to ask about the special beer served on the side (burger alone is \u00a311; and \u00a315 for the special, which is a \u00a33 discount on the bottle of Bourbon Baby).Sadly, I wasn't all that into it. The candied bacon wasn't crispy, but sloggy and dripping in the BBQ that was liberally applied. The BBQ was already fairly sweet, so I don't know that the \"candied\" bacon (or the sweet saut\u00e9ed onions for that matter) really added anything to this other than that it looks pretty good on paper. So this one wasn't for me, but I should have known given my recent life choice of being a burger purist.I didn't mean for this to be a review of a specific burger rather than this new HB location, so I'll note that service was excellent - quick and friendly - this location has slightly more seating than the Camden and Brixton ones. As such, it def feels less unique/indie/cozy. Sigh, can't have it all I 'spose.",

I will forgive the undercooked burger as they had a trainee on the grill, seemed for a Friday at 2.30 they were still rushed.FoodI think I went in on an off day. Burger was undercooked, I didn't get my salad, I seemed to get the dregs of the chips (third the size fries). Gluten free Burger bun was not as yummy as usual. I saw my friends fritter, they could work on the vegetarian option. I think it was a bad day.SummaryAlright... Could do with more staff and more space, or fewer chairs.

Its located near Kings X station, so you can politely escape from anyone who is of the No. 2 personality type.Honest Burger does simplicity very well, and that is a good thing. Plus, its one of the few 'high-end' burger joints that serve (quite lovely rosemary salted) friends included in the price of their burgers.+ Pick a meat or veg, pick one of 1-3 options, or a special. Done, blam, get it in your mouth. In fairness its a rare occasion I say it, but ALL of the burgers are good. + Chipotle mayonnaise is delicious, and very more-ish.+ Decent selection of beers (I had The Honest Pale Ale from Beavertown) served in a chilled tulip-glass.+Kick-ass staff. 'Honestly', if there is an option for an Honest Burger near you when you are craving, go there. Its far better than the majority out there claiming to be burger wunderkinds. And is definitely a lot less grott/greasy/dark than MEATmarket.",

When the order came, it was a bit of a whomp whomp moment. The burger is quite small in size. To be fair it did fill me up, but that's because I cleaned up the fries that came with and drank 5 cups of water. I think should be slightly bigger or at least fill up the burger with more of the dressing so it doesn't look so empty and a bit sad. The taste was good and I liked it because for whatever the name of the place is worth, it sold me- \"Honest\" Burger. I'm a stickler when it comes to ground meat/beef patties/factory processed meats. So when the website says the meats are supplied by Ginger Pig, I'm already engaged. When I choose to buy meat, I support farmers that grow stress free cows with a hay and grass diet. Staff was nice but a bit slow. Would help if they were a bit more attentive as we were trying to get their attention many times but they would walk right pass. Overall the meal was good and I like the quality. \u00a0I'd visit again when I'm craving a burger.",

I do like a good burger and everyone was raving about this place when it first opened but I couldn't justify waiting in the queue for hours back then sooo only just finally decided to give it a go as we had a bit of time to kill and there was only one couple in the \"queue\".What I mean by \"queue\" is that there doesn't actually seem to be any organised queue.. You rock up, tell the waiters you want a table for two and then I guess they simply remember the order in which different people came because there wasn't any writing down of names /list or anything.. Thankfully as we were second in line this didn't affect us, but for the 15 or so people that came after, I really wondered how they would all get seated in order...Any who! I'm waffling... THE BURGER! I tried an honest burger seeing as that seemed to be the main thing.. And well ... It's an OK burger. Nothing amazing, or out of the ordinary - I've had tastier burgers at Byron's and Shakeshack tbh. The chips were also OK... The lemonade was nice... The onion rings were pretty tasty... The service was pretty quick so that's a plus... But I just wouldn't queue for more than 15mins to eat here.. It's really nothing that special.Oh the other good thing is that they have gluten free buns! Hurray for coeliacs everywhere!",

Honest Burger's relaxed atmosphere makes it a perfect place for a date or small gathering with friends. Make sure you put in a reservation, as I was quoted at a 2 hour wait when I visited. I grabbed a beer and explored the nearby neighborhood, as it is in quite a fun part of London. Honest Burger's most popular burger bears their name the \"Honest Burger\". It features a flavorful patty cooked to order, red onion relish, smoked bacon, mature cheddar, pickled cucumber, and shredded lettuce. Upon receiving my burger, I noticed that there had been no sauce applied. I tried it without sauce thinking the onion relish may be the intended topping. I noted the condiments on the table and quickly added a healthy portion of mayo knowing it would create a rich and creamy effect with the savory red onion relish. After applying the mayo, I had one of the best burgers in London in my hands. AMAZING bacon that is amongst some of the best I have had in all my travels (best bacon in London, so far). Compared to the very best burgers I've had the bun was a little too toasted and the beef was not quite as juicy.",

The onion \"jam\" and bacon additions, along with the meat cooked to pink, made it a very solid offering. My main criticism were the lack of \"optional\" toppings (included being tomatoes and eggs, to of my personal favorites). The bun itself is reasonably good, but I also couldn't call it anything particularly standout. Overall, very good burger, very reasonable pricepoint (particularly for London) and great ambience for an informal meal. It's a tiny place, so I recommend going if you're on your own or with a small group; they also don't take reservations but were very nice about letting me sit for a bit while I waited for my friend to join me.As the other reviews mention, the real differentiator here is the rosemary fries (chips, as the Brits would say). They come standard issue with the burgers and sandwiches, and you can also order extra on the side if you are so inclined.See my menu photo for a full representation of this restaurant's offering!",

E and I both went for the Honest burger - patty with red onion relish, smoked bacon, mature cheddar, pickled cucumber and lettuce, which comes with signature rosemary fries. Washed down with ginger beer and homemade lemonade.....So the verdict - did the Honest live up to all the hype? Yes. Yes it did. It's not quite my best burger in London - that title is proudly held by the folks over at Patty & Bun but it's a very close second. the patty is nice and juicy and the bun is robust enough to stay together right until the last bite. the chips definitely get a special nod - plus its becoming increasingly rare for restaurants to include chips alongside the meal instead of charging you extra so that's alwaysa good thing.",

I'm a big burger fan and can safely say that I have been too all the top burger joints over the last couple of years (and I keep going back). I have been to Honest around 15 times. Where does honest rank? Their beef, chorizo, manchego.... burger was the best I have EVER had. Not just in London. But ever. (Been to 40 countries around the world!)Their regular burgers and specials since are good but fall behind Patty & Bun in my honest opinion. Still lacks behind some burger places in America (except for that damn special!)Their fries will always top the London burger scene, rosemary fries. Fantastic. They also benefit from having a iPad waiting system, which competitors are lacking. This allows you to grab a drink elsewhere if the wait is long (and it will be). Definitely go!Ps. Can you bring the special back or offer it to me for one day?",

However, as another reviewer commented, the flavor of the patty was quite bland and it wasn't very tender. The fries were fine. Service was friendly. Ambiance was OK but music just a tad too loud.

I've tried the Honest Burger and I also tried their special at the time which had jalapenos all up in it. Both burgers were pretty good and definitely filled me up. I wouldn't go as far as saying it's the best burger ever. It's not in my opinion. But they pride themselves on using great British produce.

The standard for burgers in London is high, with local favorites like Patty & Bun, Byron, and GBK already contesting the American influx of chains like Five Guys and Shake Shack. I ordered The Honest and my main problems with it were: 1) The burger was not served hot. Lukewarm at best. 2) The patty was smaller than the bun and not juicy at all. It felt like it was equivalent to maybe 4 bites at most. 3) The bun was disappointing. I am used to brioche buns in London and this was not noteworthy at all. Felt like a mediocre bun that you could have picked up at a supermarket in America. 4) The rosemary chips they served us were tiny shards of potato that were more appropriate to eat with a spoon. Is this what they serve you after 9 pm? Their potato leftovers?And then finally, this is the only place in London that I can remember who gave me the bill before I asked for it. By that time it was 10 pm but the location isn't supposed to close until 11 pm so I thought that was very premature and unnecessary.",

    "text": "Other than being a huge ramen fanatic, I am an equally huge burger fanatic. For some time now, since having tried the heavenly deliciousness of Tommy J's in Davis, California, USA, I have been on the hunt for a burger to topple the flavor from Tommy J's.While Honest Burgers isn't quite a Tommy J's, it definitely makes it to my list of London's top burger joints.Now, let's get real. There are fast food chain burgers that are frozen patties and meant to rely on sauce to give you flavor. Then there are REAL burger shops where the meat is seasoned properly to bring out both the natural flavors and the master seasoning. Honest Burgers falls into the latter category. My girlfriend and I ordered the Honest Burger (hey, you don't know a burger after your restaurant's name unless it's good, right?) medium-pink and two jars of their homemade lemonade. Lemonade? Tasty. The Honest Burger? Even tastier.The grill masters in the kitchen definitely know what they are doing when they are preparing and grilling these patties to make them so succulent and flavorful. If you're in the area, I would definitely recommend this burger stop for some tasty burgers.And if you're in Northern California, USA sometime... I highly recommend traveling to Davis, California and stopping by \"Tommy J's\" (inside a bar called Froggy's). The world's best burgers are still made there.Cheers",

I was so let down! \u00a0I got the Honest and subbed cheddar for stilton. \u00a0Where was that stilton? \u00a0I have no idea because I couldn't taste it. \u00a0And there is no sauce to speak of on the burger, so mayo had to be added. \u00a0But despite the addition of the mayo, and despite the fact that my burger was a pleasant pink color, it was quite possibly the driest burger I've had since moving to London. \u00a0Seriously dry. \u00a0Bizarrely so.That being said. \u00a0The chips are fantastic. \u00a0Probably in the top 3 of chips, and for a person who isn't the biggest fan of rosemary, that's a lot coming from me.We sat outside, so service was nonexistent. \u00a0We had to fetch the bill ourselves, and I noticed that of the three tables outside, one other table had to do the same, so not a great batting average. \u00a0I find the menu extremely limited as well. \u00a0If you're only going to offer three burgers, you better make sure they're done extremely well.Maybe I just had a fluke experience, but sadly, I don't see myself coming back.",

She took me to Honest Burgers. She had hyped it up A LOT. I was expecting great things. I took her recommendation in ordering the Honest burger, while she opted for the vegetarian fritter burger. I was curious why my burger monster of a sis would opt for the veggie option, but turned out she's had everything on the menu at least twice and was having a non-meat day.The Honest burger at \u00a39 (fries included!) was the most flavoursome burger I've eaten since I had the one at Goodman last year (and their burger is pretty damn good). The fries with rosemary salt is out of this world, and to top it all off I could eat my meal with an ice cold fresh ginger beer in hand! For real this is my top combo.Anyway, that soft warmed bun, the onion relish and the smoked bacon and mature cheddar hit my tastebuds to deliver a perfect mouthful of burger with every bite. No extra sauce needed or falling apart burger bun. Even my sis couldn't resist and ended up taking a bite out of my burger. So much for non-meat day. It was Sunday she commented...Meat-free Monday is tomorrow.",

And he was right, these are not your behemoth Byron burgers but very medium sized and managable, I didn't have to unbutton my pants or anything after. I've passed by the HB in Brixton and thought it looked very hip in design, this branch looks decidedly IKEA and middle class. Lots of pine furniture. Not so middle class though when they plonked ketchup and Hellmans' mayo in a plastic bottle on the table. My Diet Coke came still in the can. Uhh, no glass? \u00a0Listen, you can't be middle class in price* and style and then ghetto burger bar in other ways. Be consistent. Those cocktails that come in mason jars trend was fully in place though. We upped our 'meh' to an 'hmmm' when the food arrived. Initially the rosemary chips blew me away, they were fabulous. But the more you eat, the more heavily salted and seasoned they start to feel in your mouth. The burger was quite good. I'd defintely go back again for one. And \u00a38 price tag was a totally reasonable meal. I'd be happier if they offered starters too, I do like to feel like a glutton leaving these places. * \u00a311.50 for the special burger! What a jump in the price tag!",

A truly simple burger with strong bold flavours.

The onion relish is painfully sweet. Not the kind of sweetness that you can get from caramelizing onions, but rather the kind you get from adding a ton of sugar. It ruins what is otherwise a decent, but not great burger. The meat is in a nice thick patty, but not nearly the flavor of Shake Shake.I've had problems with incorrect orders and then when it was fixed the plate came out with the original portion of chips, now stone cold. It was corrected eventually, but frustrating nonetheless.",

We got there at the perfect time and didn't have to wait for a table for four, but noticed as we were leaving that a long queue has formed, so arrive early!The menu is simple. Order a burger and it comes with rosemary-flavoured chips. Beef burger is the star, although there are chicken and veggie varieties, plus gluten-free buns too. You can configure your burgers as you like it (medium rare? Extra patties? Curry sauce? No problem!)There's also a good selection of drinks, including local ale (bottled) and cocktails to wash down the burgers and chips. Great spot for quickly refuelling if you are nearby.",

They also play the \"organic\" and \"hipster atmosphere\" cards, which makes you even happier to eat there.Last good point: prices! Even for being in the middle of London (that is clearly not the cheapest town around) prices are really reasonable, as you can count your burger/fries/drink for less than 15\u00a3.Looking forward to my next London trip, be sure I'll pass by Honest!",

Our trip has taken us to many a burger joint around the Soho/Oxford street area. The latest joint was Honest Burgers in Soho. The menu is small but easy which clearly helped the chef as out orders arrived very quickly. I ordered the Honest burger and honestly it was great! The meat was cooked perfectly and full of flavour and best of all the fries come WITH the burger instead of having to order them separately. This automatically gives Honest an extra point in my book. The best thing about this place was that when we were finished we walked back to the office and all commented on how comfortable we felt i.e we weren't stuffed to bursting point which is usually the case on Burger Wednesday. This wasn't down to the portions as they were very good. I think it was just because it was such a clean and well cooked burger. I for one am really happy that so many great burger places are now dotted throughout London town and Honest is easily up there with the best!",

We were told by a very friendly host that its going to be an hour and forty-five mins for a table for two. Hmmmm. We were almost discouraged but we toughed it out. We really want to try HB. So we left our number and ran an errand to kill sometime. Thankfully by the time we returned to HB we got seated almost immediately. The process of ordering was quick as they have straight-forward menu. I had the cheese burger while my husband had the HB. In just few minutes our order arrived. Ohhhh looks good! The burger did look a tad small but my husband and I thought it was just adequate. The meat patty was juicy and the other ingredients that came with it tasted pretty satisfactory together. However, I cant help myself from comparing it to my favorite burger (in-n-out)--the special sauce. It would have been perfect if that sauce was added to it. On the other hand, my husband and I were impressed of the crispy rosemary chips (fries) that came with it. It was really delicious. We will definitely come back here.",

This place is small with two tables outside, one for four, the other for two. Inside, window seating is a counter with three seats and then about a dozen tables inside. It was controlled chaos and managed to get in just before another lined formed outside. The selection is limited, but with a burger that good there really doesn't have to be any more on the menu. The Honest burger should be the only choice. Just a really great burger. Fries were nicely seasoned and a fair drink selection. Five stars if we did not have to wait so long to place an order and to get the bill. One person handled all of that and with his head to the ground, there was little chance to get his attention. He made it busier than it had to be. Any with the noisy group of birthday people, it was almost to the point of obnoxious. Get rid of those two, and this is easily five stars.",

The burger was delicious - simple, no frills and accompanied with yummy rosemary fries. My only small gripe was that we were a table of about 7 and they forgot an order, a bit unfortunate, but the waitress was extremely apologetic, notified the kitchen immediately and took it off our bill. Not used to seeing that kind of service in London! Would definitely come back when the burger craving hits.",

Just find it a bit kinda 'your done, get out' and this is kinda honest burgers approach. It kinda put a damperner on the visit and considering that we were on our third round of drinks and looking to order another round of food, which is good, they could do with sorting out that part of the business.",

Burgers in London are known to be simple, just your beef patty, lettuce, tomato, and bacon so that the quality of beef is highlighted, while NY burgers are known for speciality toppings and sauces. Honest Burgers is exactly the epitome of what London burgers are acclaimed to be. The patty wasn't seasoned, which you would assume would be bland, but it was actually the opposite. The burger was so flavorful and dripping in its juices. You were able to taste the pure beefiness. Add the perfectly seasoned Rosemary fries and you have a complete meal! Also, another thing to note about the burgers in London - you don't feel guilty and weighed down while devouring it and after you finished your meal. It's a win -win situation in my books!",

So it's my last day here I walk in and I see theres 3 types of burgers you can get. Chicken / Beef / Vegetables. \u00a0You know im a little T-Rex so I had to go with the beef. It comes with beef, red onion, smoked bacon, matured cheddar, pickled cucumber and lettuce. Your order automatically comes with a side of rosemary chips. Its actually huge as I could not finish all my chips.The burger was fantastic, big juicy patty it looked to be 1/4 - 1/2 lb. They cook it how you want so I asked for medium. All the ingredients in the burger are so tasty the fat pieces of bacon, the pickled cucumber, cheddar, red onion, gives it an amazing savory / delicious / a tiny hint of sweetness taste as you eat this. \u00a0After taking my first bite you know when you just shake your head like yeah this is good this is good this is really good.. and you don't say a word and continue to demolish your meal, thats what this was.The rosemary chips were a perfect compliment to the meal and it was delicious!Also look how they put the straw in my coke can, they bent the opening tab thing forward instead of how we usually put it towards the back and stuck my straw through there. \u00a0These English people.. they're on to something mate....!",

They also default to medium (on the medium rare side), which I rarely get in the UK. \u00a0It was the perfect burger. \u00a0I had the Honest Burger, which included cheese, a nice onion relish, bacon (not overpowering), pickles and lettuce (which I didn't notice, but that is a plus). \u00a0Also includes rosemary chips (fries for my American friends), which were crispy and had a nice distinctive rosemary taste. \u00a0I was a little disappointed in the onion rings, they just did not have much flavor. \u00a0The burger, though, earns five stars on its own.",

Their rosemary chips are just amazing and their beverages are good too. The staff was so friendly and fun. It took a while to get our drinks but it was pretty busy so I didn't mind. I will definitely make it a point to go to Honest Burgers now every time I am in London.",

The buns are jut perfect \u00a0the right consistency. The beef burger was one of the best I've had. Same bun \u00a0and just the right balance of moist medium rare meet \u00a0with a well grilled exterior.We also tried their coleslaw which was delicious with added dill.I only had tap water but the table next door had home made lemonade served in jars, which looked fun (yes, I need to get out more).Although I didn't have room \u00a0the veggie burger looks amazing \u00a0it's cauliflower sweetcorn courgette fritter in a bun \u00a0with all kinds of delicious sounding salad things.The bill is presented in a retro tin box, which is also a fun and quirky touch.If you can deal with all the model types and uber trendy Soho crowd that come here \u00a0you are in for a treat.Prices I'd say are average or reasonable \u00a0\u00a38.50 for the chicken or \u00a37.50 for the beef \u00a0both include a choice of fries or coleslaw. I will definitely be back and not least because of the tasty food, good value and superb service.",

No thrills.My partner enjoyed the chicken burger and said it was exceptional. So maybe thats worth considering. The Rosemary fries are nice as well, big portions that come with each burger. This is a nice touch, in a city full of burger restaurants that think they can charge separately for fries.Homemade lemonade was cool too, could have been a little bit sweeter but the glass that it came in was brilliant.Only negatives were that there appeared to be construction/building sounds coming from beneath the floors in the restaurant. Very loud banging and drilling that ruined the atmosphere for us and the couple besides us.",

However, there wasn't a sheet to take down names. Their waiting list was one waiter who had to remember your name and how many were in your party, in addition to serving other guests their orders. It took us 20 minutes for him to even talk to us to take down our name for party of 2. During that time, we witnessed two disagreements between the waiter and other parties. He apparently thought one group had left when they didn't and another had made a reservation and it somehow got lost. We were told the wait was over 1 hour so we left, went across the street to Barons and were seated right away.",

I thought the rosemary chips were alright but I occasionally got a grassy bitterness from them that didn't really do it for me. And back to the burger. I got the cheeseburger with stilton. It was solid, for sure, but I didn't get any 'wow' factor. I'm still giving this place four stars because the food was very good and the service was efficient and friendly. Definitely a worthwhile stop on the London burger circuit.",

A little bit of a puzzle to find but it's basically directly opposite Burger and Lobster if you're on Dean and directly opposite Byron if you're on Wardour. Ironically those two places are also burger restaurants but you'd be mad to miss out on an Honest burger for a \u00a320 burger from B&L or a burger from Byron. Don't get me wrong, Byron's pretty good, but it ain't an honest burger. The place is small and it gets busy most nights. They don't take bookings either so don't you go jumping the gun thinking you've outsmarted us queuers by making a booking. Menu is simple and short. You can't go wrong with a classic honest burger but you can take your pic from the other burgers on the menu. All burgers come with homemade rosemary chips. Chunky like a proper British chip. You can substitute chips with any of the other sides, staff are happy to do that and won't make a fuss.There's always one lager on tap, a gluten beer option, and soft drinks as well as cocktails. Food is excellent. Burgers are always cooked perfectly (medium but on the rarer side of medium.) Service is fast and friendly. Amazing every time. Don't miss it if you're in Soho and want a burger.",

This was about 7-10 min walk and thankfully there was a table outside as we walked up. After careful debate, we chose to get one of the honest burger and the buffalo chicken special then split the meals. As we had just arrived from Edinburgh by train, I was starving (read: murderously hangry) so we grabbed an order of onion rings when ordering our drinks. The drinks arrived and were delicious. I suggest almost all of the cocktails since we tried 4 of them in our short visit. The onion rings were flipping enormous and audibly crispy. They had fennel or anise in there which gave it quite a different flavor in the batter. Then the sandwiches arrived. Holy crap. That delicious crispy chicken. I will have dreams about you, my darling. Covered in hot sauce and blue cheese, you made my entire being happy. Especially since we had not had a chance to eat much that morning. The burger was delightful. The chips/fries were rosemary flavored and perfectly fried. I would go back here next time in London and that looks super likely in the next few trips.",

    "text": "HB for the win Listen, burgers are not unique to the US anymore. Yes, there was a time when the world turned their noses up at this type of food, but those days are long gone. London, much like Paris and other European cities is going through, or should I say, has already gone through a burger revolution. It's very easy to find a burger that will run circles around a lot of places you'd find in NYC, and Honest is one of those places (honestly...had to don't hate me). We happened upon this place our first day in the city, fresh in from Edinburgh in need of a bite. This place was a pretty easy call, it had simple food, great reviews, and a nice cocktail selection. We grabbed a couple of seats at one of the small tables outside, ordered up some large sized drinks (the spiked lemonade was quite good), and settled in. First up were the spicy onion rings, they were pretty much perfect, large, beer battered (I think), and 100% big enough to split between two people. Speaking of splitting, they had a new buffalo chicken sandwich on the menu that we both wanted to try, so we did half of one each along with half an honest burger. It was SPUER hard to pick which was better, as the burger was really really good, but I think I have to give it to the chicken, it was amazeballs. So there you go, not only is the UK better at burgers now, but they are also better at frying chicken and making it spicy and delcious. The USA is going downhill I tell you.",

    "text": "Went to Soho's Honest as an ambitious group of 8 and miraculously found a table on a Saturday evening. I ordered the following:- BBQ chicken wings- Beef burger with Stilton- Rosemary salted chipsThe wings arrived first and are an interesting take on the barbecued chicken wing. They are more tangy than sweet but it works, especially when combined with the raw spring onion sprinkled on top. There is a satisfying crisp which borders on the chicken being tough to chew on but again this works.I broke my number one rule when ordering burgers and managed to undo the whole point of getting the simplest burger on the menu. I wanted to judge the quality of the patty itself but in adding Stilton, the subtleties in the meat's flavour were lost on me. I love Stilton and I love burgers but not together. I was in a large group ordering under pressure, we all make mistakes.The fries are satisfying and fit into what seems to be a company policy of cooking things for just under too long. They arrive in a beautiful golden brown hue and are basically crisps by the time you reach the small pieces at the bottom. As a fan of slightly burnt food this was paradise. They are more salty than rosemary-ey but that isn't a complaint.It's pretty cramped with a shortage of toilets but with really friendly staff and food cooked to (just short of too long) perfection, Honest is well worth the visit.",

Thankfully the coriander & other spices weren't overpowering, & the pesto sauce I added went well with the flavors of the patty. I'm always looking for a veggie burger that isn't made with black beans & this one went above & beyond with using veggies creatively. The only minus was consistency, which was softer than I would've liked. Honest Burgers are served with Rosemary Salted Chips but I also had to try their onion rings...so good, but so greasy!

Burgers and burger joints are dime a dozen, so when you find one where the burgers are juicy and not too oversized, where the toppings are balanced for flavors, not to just heap on the fats, that's really cool. This is a nice cozy one, with a great wait staff. Hiding on side street in SOHO, it can get busy, so waits may be a thing. Wait! It's worth it.",

There was a slight smell of pork coming from the bacon, but don't let that trick you - the patties were all beef! \u00a0The chips were good, the veggies were fresh, and the burgers were filling. If you are trying to gain weight; you can order double meat & cheese!Standard soft drinks available, as well as limited bar options. The Honest Cup was a vodka drink similar to the live-child from a mule and a mojito. I recommend this drink! \u00a0Quick service, and low prices. Try 'em out!",

By far the best decision of the night. The 15-20 minute wait outside in the cold rain was worth it. While we waited, one of the waiters would consistently come outside to keep everyone updated on the wait time and make a joke or two. Staff was very personable which made waiting less annoying. After finally getting a seat we ordered the Soho Burger and the limited time Guacamole Burger...both delicious! We opted to get double burgers instead of singles which turned out to be a little too much food but that led to some tasty leftovers. We also ordered a side of the curry sauce which gave the fries an interesting kick of flavor. Overall I said this was probably in my top 5 burgers I've ever had. Go here and thank me later.",

Their fries (chips for you Brits) are seasoned with I believe rosemary which is a perfectly compliment to their crispness. I also had the apple, red cabbage, beetroot coleslaw which is not your typical side slaw (I think it was the first thing I finished). And to top it off they have Daura Damm which is IMHO the premier GF beer. Whether you need to be GF or not, this place is doing a mic drop on any other burger shop around. Don't miss it!",

    "text": "The London burger scene has improved dramatically over the years, and while Honest Burgers is one of those spots that represents the city's budding burger scene, even Honest Burgers still falls flat in the category that burgers back in the states are quickly mastering: patty flavor. Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?With a reputation for having the best burgers in the city (Next to Patty and Bun and maybe some Byron locations), Honest can play host to some significant lines, but on a Saturday night I only had to wait shy of fifteen minutes before I had my takeaway burger. Service is friendly and accommodating, and the location prime just off the main strip away from the noise and drunk folks. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?I'm honestly teetering a bit with this one. For years now I've said that no fast casual burger should ever exceed $15.00 (11.61 GBP as of August 2016). My Hometown Burger at Honest came to $16.10 USD, although to be entirely fair it was the menu special that was priced at a significant premium. It wasn't a big burger, but given it was a special I can really only fault myself here. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?As I alluded to earlier, everything about this burger was good right up until the patty. The bun? Well proportioned, buttery, and fluffy but not to the point of being obtrusive and distracting. The toppings? Marvelous - with bacon, smoked something or another, lettuce, and melted cheese that came together brilliantly. But then, when everything seemed in place as though a London burger joint would finally compete with what's commonplace stateside, the patty fell flat. Walk into a stateside burger kitchen and you'll see salt, pepper, onions, paprika, chorizo, and all kinds of other goodies being grilled right into the raw meat as it evolves into a patty. The result is often a patty so flavorful that you don't even need toppings; and in my opinion that's the measure of a truly special burger. In contrast, my burger patty at Honest fell flat, and was essentially tasteless without help from the toppings. So close!Single Star Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?All Honest has to do is flavor up their patties and we'll have a winner. Until then, not so much. No Star Granted.",

Although the interiors are not as funky as Tommi's, I found this place definitely more comfortable.The burger itself was heaven. It was the perfect medium rare. The bacon and the cheese balanced out the flavors excellently.And they serve Samuel Smith Ales, which is just beautiful. I do think the chips were a bit too much on the \"homefries\" side, but then, I guess I'm just spoiled by fries in Toronto.So 9 bucks for a burger? I don't mind, if they continue serving burgers from heaven.",

I went with the Tribute, an American style burger with streaky bacon, American cheese, burger sauce and mustard and pickles. A great combination of ingredients but too much sauce masked the beef and bacon flavour.Chips are served in the price of the meal which is nice as many burger joints nowadays count them separately. The chips were excellently done with Rosemary and a hint of lemon. They rounded off the meal really well and I think by the end they were the part I most enjoyed. Daily cocktail for \u00a35, served in a jar, was a nice drink to compliment the meal and prevent it being too heavy. Today's was gin, cucumber, and lemon. Perfect before a show if you can get a table. It's a really small restaurant, seating about 30, but they have a fairly quick turnover rate and the possibility of booking ahead. The size is one of the reasons I enjoyed the place so much, it wasn't loud but it had energy.",

    "text": "Ugh Honest Burgers I had such high expectations for you. After reading the mountain of insanely positive reviews on Yelp, I wandered to Meard Street to try one for myself, and left quite disappointed. When I arrived it was full but one table, which I was given. I instantly loved the feel of the place. It feels like a vintage cafe in Brighton or somewhere by the sea, and decent music was playing over the speakers. The food at people's tables looked great and I was excited. I chose The Federation Burger; a \u00a313.50 special that was just basically the Honest Burger, but double the cheese, patty and bacon. It came out with rosemary chips after about 15 minutes, and I inspected. The burger patties were nicely medium cooked, the bacon was a bit overdone, and for some obscure reason the onion relish and pickles were put on both the top of the burger under the top bun, and at the bottom of the burger under the bottom patty, which automatically made the bottom bun really soggy and it disintegrated almost as soon as I lifted it. The whole thing was just a bit lacklustre. It was dry and flavourless, and the rosemary chips started excellent but then left your mouth feeling really gritty and got sickening quickly. I'm hoping that I've just had a bad experience, and it was in no way bad enough for me not to return, but if my next experience is similar then there probably won't be a third.On a positive note, the cloudy lemonade in a little jug is absolutely delicious. I would happily drink 100 glasses of it. Yum.",

    "text": "In addition to being absolute tourists, this past week Erica and I have been exploring a bit of London with our friends Matt and Lea. In a quest to find a great burger around here, we stumbled upon a place called Honest Burgers that isn't too far from where we're staying in Soho.They have a really straightforward--honest--menu. A chicken burger, a beef burger (options for cheese or \"Honest\" with bacon, red onion relish, lettuce, cheddar, and pickles), and a fritter vegetarian burger sandwich thing.A Honest beef burger with fries and a soda costs \u00a310.5 (about $16.5) making it one of the more expensive meals I've written about.An Honest Burger: beef, red onion relish, smoked bacon, mature cheddar, pickled cucumber and lettuce.On a Sunday night, it seemed not too busy, though it is a rather small place so you might see a little wait before you can have a seat.One bite into this burger and I was honestly amazed. It wasn't anything fancy, it was just that they managed to do it exactly right. The meat was cooked perfectly medium rare. The relish was surprisingly amazing. The real English bacon was heavenly. It's not a large burger, but I can say it was the perfect size.The chips (french fries) were wonderful. Served beautifully with a rosemary salt which gave them a unique and very tasty flavor.Having been away from America for the past week, I thought my opinion might've been easily swayed. Tonight, we visited Honest Burgers again. All four of us. Lo and behold, it was again amazing. Had to double check. Big fans all around, every single one of us enjoyed it.",

That was a first for both of us but we think that the flavour combination of the burger (the relish, the blood lettuce, the cajun spice, the bloody mary sauce) was good enough!Oh and the chips with rosemary salt were AMAZING! so crunchy and again well seasoned!Can't wait to go back and try their original burgers!",

    "text": "Honestly, a really good burger place.Clean, wooden tables with no coverings or unnecessary flowers in pound-shop vases. Clean chairs, small space but cosy and actually the type of space I like to sit, eat, people watch, chat or get up close & personal with my food.A black board with the limited, but good food choices is on the wall - although they do have a menu with the same.I like these places that don't spend ooo-gobs of cash on over complicating a space but instead concentrating on the food and service. They do it very well here.I don't do queues or waiting for food and I didn't have to here. Arrived just after they opened and got a seated right away. Order taken and I checked out the scene while smelling those burgers cooking. I think I got a bit excited. I was here to check out the Brew Burger (featured for 1 month only). I passed on the matching Bourbon Baby brew (don't eat or like chocolate flavours) but the server recommended the Big Wave. It's a Hawaiian beer with very light citrus undertones - this helped with the fries; more on those below...All the burgers are cooked medium. I had to minus the bacon & cucumber which they were happy to accommodate. Juicy and flavourful. It's a finger lickin', two napkin burger. The 1st of two slight negatives are the fries. Rosemary fries - no big deal IMO and the Brew Burger could stand alone without them. The flavour of the fries was slightly masked because they were overly salty & a bit overcooked. They do have other sides but frankly, the burger is the star of this show.Even though it's small & people do queue here, you are not rushed to give up your table. Very good service. No constantly interrupting you mid-bite either. They balance things just right here.I more than like this place & I'll be sure to make a return visit....oh, that second slight negative? The music could be turned down a bit so patrons don't have to raise their voices to talk.",

As I caressed the burger the bun was glowing like the most beautiful sun I have ever seen. As I bit into the burger my taste buds exploded with delight.

I have eaten a lot of burgers. But none that have compared to the greatness that Honest Burgers has been offering me for a long, long time. I must admit I have been holding off on reviewing this place for a while because I needed some London hamburgers to compare it to. And guess what? Honest are still undefeated champions in my estimation!They cook the burgers to pinky perfection (although they are more than happy to serve it however you would prefer) and conseal them in a perfect, yet slightly sweet tasting bun. I have tried all of the variants that they offer here, but still my favourite is the plain classic simple hamburger - everything within is just perfect. The sweetness of the onion relish as it balances off the taste of the bun and the salty beef patty. Heaven! Combining this with what I believe to be my favourite chips currently being served in London and you have a heavenly combo. I think that Byron burgers are pretty good. However, I really feel that their standard of chips to let them down, and compare these to the rosemary salted Honest chips and you are really in a different league.I think that they have done a good job in establishing the decor here that now runs cohesively through the rest of the Honest branches. Nothing too swish, more of a \"shack\" concept than fine dining, but I feel that this fits well within the context of eating a hamburger.The staff are trained well, on the whole. Without being over the top, they serve you well and have yet to let me down.They offer a number of craft beers which I cannot really comment upon as I do not drink beer! However, I do often have their Honest cocktail which is a gin & cucumber-based affair and this is really great. Another area where I think that they do well is that they do not add a service charge to the bill. I always feel that you inevitably get better service when the staff are actually working for their tip as opposed to knowing that very few people will ever question that it is on the bill. And with Honest, they do it right!So all in all, well done Honest! You are my favourite burger in London!",

Well, I guess that the wait is worth it as the burgers are truly delicious. The buns are soft on the inside and toasted on top and bottom and make the perfect covers for the meat which is oh, so heavenly rich in flavour. There are lots of items on their menu but I'd definitely go with the burger. As I said, the sluggish service is not a constant thing but I guess it come to luck if the place would be crowded.",

On the food front, they constantly deliver perfectly pink and wholesome burgers, with great accompanying ingredients. You really couldn't go wrong the way they do things. The chips are also top notch with their rosemary salt. Contrary to raving about food, I'm going to talk about the Honest Burger experience. This is the burger place I come to most frequently. It's not my favourite burger of them all, but they make coming here so easy. So you roll up to Meard st, which in itself is a great little cobbly road where you can see suckers dining at Wahaca, and the recently added Bunnychow (not sure about this joint), on the other end there's Burger and Lobster, Duck Soup and Cay Tre. You'd really struggle to go wrong here. But tucked away tidily is HB. Just before the tummy grumbles ensue, I would guide my devoted attendee(s) through Soho, traversing all the delectable delights of this little hub, stop by HB to put my name down, then continue on for happy hour cocktails, froyo or ice-cream. There's plenty to keep you occupied in and around Soho. A spot of shoppping up in Carnaby St never did anyone harm either. You'd check your phone from time to time and HB docks your digit ever-closer to 1. I've never seen a 0 on the webpage - but I do know that means my table is ready for me.HB is a great dining experience, I would rather wonder than wait outside on a cold evening (Patty&Bun). I understand that queues are good PR, but I just want to enjoy my food, and I'm sure you'll all agree that our time is valuable. Thank you HB for respecting that.Happy waiting - it's just up to you to find the best wait possible.",

    "text": "Honest Burger is my favourite burger joint in London. The American and Louisiana burgers remain my favourite of their specials, even enticing me to travel to the portobello road restaurant to get my mitts on the American which is permanently on the menu there.Being gluten free I love that they are one of the only burger places in London that offer gluten free buns. They even have gluten free beer. The burgers themselves are high quality meat and cooked pink (or more if you prefer). Read: super tasty. And only a tenner including chips, which is why I'm in there on average once a week. Scrummy!",

It's so good I can't believe I'm not eating one of their burgers right this very second.Not only won't they balk at rare requests (suck it, City of London) but your order is guaranteed to come out beautifully red and ready to be devoured. The rosemary fries aren't to be sneezed at, but they're drastically overshadowed by the meat.These are the best burgers in London, and I don't throw out that title casually. I've probably had burgers in dozens of locales from seedy to swanky, and Honest takes the cake by leagues.The last time I was here the special was basically a holiday burger, and while it was a great deal pricier than the standard (~\u00a313 vs. \u00a38-9.5) man it was GOOD. Of course, how can you go wrong with Camembert on a perfectly cooked slab of beef?",

Great for the continued exploration of the local pubs!I ordered the burger with fries and on every occasion I felt unsatisfied even after making omissions to the burger (red onion relish wtf?) My main boozer is just down the road so this is very convenient on a Friday or Saturday night. The burger is cooked well the slice of cheese doesn't get a chance to melt and the listless lettuce is unappealing, but at least its served on a sourdough type bun.

Overall it was an ok experience, but not great, there are many better burger places closeby.I eat my burgers well-done (just Google \"fecal matter in burgers\" and you can see why!), which you have to ask for here. What I got was a completely dried out patty with a very \"off\" consistency. I know burgers can be well-done and still juicy - I eat them all the time - so how they got it this dry, I don't know, it was a first. The relish was overpowering all other taste in the burger, so eating the burger was like eating red onion relish on bread. A red onion sandwich basically. Not great. And not a burger.The rosemary fries tasted great, but we're oddly chopped in tiny, tiny pieces, it was like a crumble of fries at the bottom of the plate. Why serve these? Made no sense. They are included in the price which is good value - no extra cost.I didn't get any water until I had finished eating, so clearly service is very very stretched here. Nice enough, but waiting 20 min on water is not great. \u00a0No napkins either, had to take them from a table next to mine.Weirdly they had no mustard on the tables - just ketchup and mayo.So all in all this place seemed to have potential, but very poorly executed and managed, it seems. It wasn't horrible, just not good. I wouldn't eat a burger here again.",

The burgers are pretty small but well made, quality beef, great aromas and the fries are pretty awesome.We ordered the honest burger, plain burger [just beef] and a cheese burger, as extra we also took some onion rings which are really yummy, and I put one in my burger - awesome upgrade!The bun is fresh and soft, and makes the whole thing even better.They also have Tabasco sauce. happiness! :DHad a really good experience and good time. too bad the burgers are so small.",

So, naturally, upon hearing all of the great things about Honest Burgers, we had to stop by when we found ourselves in London.We ordered the Honest Burger, the Specialty Burger, and two jars of their home-made lemonade. The Specialty Burger tasted a bit muddled to me (a lot of flavors going on that didn't really work), but the Honest Burger was absolutely amazing. A perfect medium pink (or medium rare as we Americans like to call it), just the right amount of toppings, and simply delicious. While this isn't the best burger that we've ever had, this definitely makes it to the top. The side of fries is also sprinkled with rosemary salt, giving it a unique herbal flavor that I've never tasted in fries before.Oh, and don't skip out on the lemonade. It's sweet, tart, refreshing, and perfect to go with your burger :)",

Honest.I had discussed going down to Brixton to visit some friends who live in the area, but then we decided to check out the chocolate festival at the London Film Museum, so I suggested we just hit up this branch of Honest Burgers (as he wanted to try it as well, but the queue was too long when he went by).So we came for lunch. There were three of us, and while there isn't a lot on the menu (a chicken burger, three beef burgers, a veggie burger, and usually some sort of special burger), we all found something that we were craving. I went with the special. It was a beef burger with Welsh Monterey Jack (Haha. When did people start making American cheeses outside of the US?), grilled courgettes and a spicy slaw (can't remember if it was chipotle or habanero).So yeah, the burger was awesome. I love how it comes medium (although it was much pinker than medium, more medium-rare I think) standard. Burgers should not be well-done in my book. Pink and rare and juicy in the middle is the way to go. And these were juicy. And delicious. And the slaw was amazing.Oh and they come with chips! Not just any chips, but ROSEMARY chips. And Rosemary is my favorite herb (pronounced 'erb). But they weren't overwhelming in Rosemary, they were just perfect. And they were crisps and fluffy. These chips are outstanding. And they come with the burger!I will definitely be heading back here. Lunch on a Saturday was surprisingly easy to get in for, but the place was pretty full by the time we left!",

    "text": "How I didn't put on weight on our trip is frankly a miracle, because burgers were our go-to meal and we had a lot of them over the six weeks.Honest was one of the best we had, we agreed that one other place in Portugal had burgers slightly better but their chips were sad, crispy (burnt) bits and these Honest chips were flawless. So as an overall burger & chips ensemble Honest was the best we had. If you like blue cheese in general, try their burger with it in. Don't be scared, it's a fearfully delicious pairing.",

They are juicy, cooked on the rarer side \u00a0of medium, with onion relish and any other condiments. \u00a0The burgers are huge!! We didn't think we'd be able to finish them....but we did! And the fries, the fries with rosemary were Devine. \u00a0Friendly service too. \u00a0Can't recommend this one enough.",
