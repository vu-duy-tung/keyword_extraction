There was nothing truly moreish about any of the food my companion and I had; surely, no one over the age of 10 is impressed by large portions. Service was friendly, if sometimes slightly incomprehensible due to accents. The only reason I'd return would be for the cocktails which were good but expensive: my Mojito de luxe at \u00a310.50 was not the costliest potation on the menu. If I understood him, our waiter said the joint offers 60 kinds of Mojitos!",

The setting and d\u00e9cor is very artsy and modern and quite pleasant. The other bar guests look young, hip and trendy and this creates a cool vibe. For our meals we chose chicken on lemongrass skewers and beef cooked two ways for starters and for our main courses we had oriental salmon with mushrooms and Cuban style barbeque chicken. All the dishes were interesting in the modern combination of Asian and Latin flavours but I came away disappointed overall, mostly because my salmon was glaringly overcooked. It oozed the creamy goo, which seeped from between every flaky layer in my fillet: a sure sign of having been overcooked. As a result, my salmon was actually dry and chunky. My other criticism was that it was far too big and overall, it tasted quite boring. My sister's chicken was far better but overall I expected much more, especially given the normal price a meal. For this price, there are far better meals to be had.",

Going to Asia de Cuba is worth the calamari salad alone. We also had the prawns to start (which were also delicious). Our mojitos were blended perfectly. As an entree, the seabass (which my very well travelled friend had never tried before) said it was the best fish he'd ever tasted and to side it with the fried rice with avocado.Again, I've been to Asia de Cuba in LA.... but honestly, if you're looking for a hoighty toighty night on the town, get dolled up, have some cocktails, have some yummy (yet expensive) food, and enjoy the moment.Wouldn't be an every weekend kind of deal, but def good for a special occasion.",

    "text": "Asia de Cuba is located in the very chic St Martins Lane Hotel. Walking into the lobby of the hotel you're met with a row of golden seats shaped like teeth, a giant flower vase, giant chess pieces, candles, garden gnomes dressing chairs \u00a0all very funky though almost seeming to try a little too hard. The restaurant is quite funkily decorated. It was all mainly white space with giant fat poles scattered throughout the room which themselves were decorated with pot plants, books, pictures, and decorated as a couch/padded wall. Not sure if it had to do with the time of day but it was also very brightly lit which is welcoming after dining at many mood lit dimly lit restaurants. The dishes at Asia de Cuba are a mixture of Asia and Latin cultures \u00a0hence the name. Looking at the menu it seems to be Asian ingredients with a Cuban spin. I've not come to Asia de Cuba yet due to the prices - starters seeming to average around \u00a320 and mains \u00a330+. However, apparently the main dishes are intended for sharing and are very generous in size so that goes some way to explaining the hefty prices. We went on an offer for \u00a325 which would get us any Bento Box plus a Mojito which was very good value for money. Food was delicious and great attention to detail had been paid to the little things. We were all very full after eating but that didn't stop us sharing a dessert - we had to go the Mexican donuts with butterscotch sauce. In a word - divine. Would have licked the plate if we hadn't been sharing! For all the feeling of chic the restaurant is actually pretty chilled and relaxed so you will definitely have a good time here at the restaurant. The food is great but the prices a little prohibitive this makes Asia de Cuba the perfect place to treat yourself now and again. My main objection to Asia de Cuba is the 15% service charge. Swanky restaurant or not I don't believe any restaurant has a right to charge this much \u00a0unless of course they offer to spoon feed me!",

    "text": "I went to Asia de Cuba on Saturday and had a truly exciting culinary adventure. Situated in the rather chic St Martins Lane hotel I had a rather opulent meal there. This is a place you go to when you want to go somewhere and push the boat out slightly, but trust me it's worth it. We were greeted by very friendly and attentive staff who explained the menu to us and made recommendations on certain things on the menu. Now to explain the menu a bit the prices on the dinner menu seem astronomical, but the portions are huge and when I say huge you could feed the whole of Asia and Cuba on what comes on the plate. Also the ingredients are of very good quality. We had a cocktail each which were balanced perfectly and mixed in very interesting ways. I seriously challenge anyone to want to criticise their mixology. To start we shared their signature dish of the Calamari salad 'Asia de Cuba' (crispy calamari with chayote, hearts of palm, banana, cashews, chicory, and radicchio, sesame orange dressing) and oh my goodness if this was the calamari salad to top all calamari salads this was it. The diversity of textures, flavours and very generous amounts of calamari almost made this a meal within itself. The sesame orange dressing was subtle and acted as a great catalyst for all the other flavours to come through. We then had Miso cured black cod, Cuban black bean and edamame salad which was garnished with some tempura shisito peppers. With that we added a side dish of plantain fried rice with avocado salsa. Now black cod for a long time I have liked but have found it to be a little overrated for what it is. After eating this I can now see what all the fuss is about. This cod was also huge. We were served two lumps of cod the size of a child's fist and the beans with edamame had a subtle hint of lime. The edamame with the black beans also worked together nicely as the edamame gave a freshness to combat the creaminess of the beans. This coupled with the rice and avocado made for a beautiful hybrid of flavours. It was also very light. The rice had a nice delicacy about it too as well as a slightly toasted flavour which went well with the small chunks of plaintain and small bits of other vegetables. They take fusion and they create things that really do work well together. With this we had some Riesling which also complimented the food very well as it was very cleansing on the palate. After this I was starting to feel a bit full but we were determined not to be defeated by the food and also another lovely thing I must add about the meal we had, was that everything we ate didn't sit heavily on the stomach or was over seasoned or sauced. We decided to brave a dessert and the staff were very kind in allowing us to have a smaller sized portion of one of the desserts as again the size of most desserts would have been enough for 4 people to share and really pig out. After a little deliberation we decided to share the rather interestingly named 'Coconut invasion' (coconut, white chocolate ganache and rum-flamed banana layer cake with dulce de leche ice cream) and this seemed to be a cake that was a cross between sponge cake and cheese cake and was rather dense. Luckily the dulce de leche was quite milky as this cut through the cake, and rum flamed bananas that were served on the side. The interesting wedge shape felt like we were eating a sculpted wedge of multi layered art. The presentation of food here is contemporary and eye-catching. The waiting staff were incredibly attentive and very friendly. I will definitely be going back as I feel the menu and I have unfinished business to conclude. I also feel that my views on fusion food have been changed as it isn't a case of just using coconut instead of cream in everything or spattering everything in coriander and calling it 'fusion' as I have experienced in the past.",

Once you are at your table you feel comfortable and almost homely (if only I had service like this at home). The food was fantastic, very original fusion food but all worked very well. We had tuna with wasabi mash - deeeelish, and slow roast pork belly - melt in the mouth. Very good wine and superb deserts. And they made us espresso martinis even though they weren't on the menu and they were the best espresso martinis I've ever had. I have no idea how much it was as I was being taken out so wasn't allowed to see the bill. But anywhere that doesn't put the prices on the menu worries me. As they say, if you have to ask, you can't afford it. I would imagine that to be true of Asis de Cuba, but if I could afford it, I'd go there all the time. Oh, and if you do go, make sure to check out the loos. I don't want to give it away but once you find them you may not be able to leave",

A very friendly lady interrogated my colleague and I at the door Is this your first time sir? Anyway, she explained to my colleague the concept of the restaurant and how sharing of food works. This seems to be their standard way of greeting but I must admit that it works. Not only are we able to know the menu, I think their CHAT LINE helps people to feel at home \u00a0which exactly how I felt by the time we were seated at our table.Our waiter was introduced to us. Then again he made us familiar with the menu and quizzed us again . I told him that since it was just the two of us dining that we would like to have the starters and main served at the same time.I was over stuffed during my last visit. Since my guest is not a big eater, I requested only 2 of their signature dishes: calamari salad and rhum roasted pork. Before we could finish our beer, the food arrived. Although I was famished, I was hoping that the food was served a bit later. And for this reason I am not giving a perfect score.I did not enjoy as much the calamari salad as I did the pork. I regret for not having the Thai beef salad instead because I remember from my last visit that I preferred this to the calamari. But the pork was simply divine. Very tender and rich in flavour. When the waiter was deboning it in front of us, you could almost see the meat naturally shreading with a few strokes of the utensils.All throughout the night, I have never felt for a split second that we were neglected. Someone was always coming to pour wine or check how we were doing. They were so attentive and miticulous with the table setting \u00a0on, during and after the dinner. When the waiter saw a tiny bit of the pork sauce (a dot) on the table cloth after he cleared our plates, he immediately produced a cloth to cover the somewhat untidy section. His attention to detail was superb.I had a double espresso. I was so full I could not be tempted to have desserts.We thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The ambience, the hospitality and the food blended perfectly well \u00a0I will definitely keep coming back.",

Honestly, the only memorable 'taste sensation' (my new word now stolen from Master Chef) were the churros and sorbet. The food was inventive, and the service was great. BUUUT, I think this is more of \u00a0a place to stop by for cocktails and maybe a few appetisers.",

You'll soon be satisfied by a celeb hobnobbing hot spot, a designophile's dream and one of the more interesting menus in London. You will then give them all of your money, and leave wondering if it's expensive because it's chic, or chic because it's expensive. (You will then go to Leicester Square and get a McFlurry from McDonalds to ponder these life truths.) The venue is absolutely gorgeous, as is the staff, as is the clientele, as is the food. You'd be silly not to know going in that you'll be charged an arm and a leg, so I won't even touch on this point that seems to be the centre of many complaints. Here's the catch -- these portions are meant for sharing! They are enormously priced because they are enormously portioned. And on that note, they are enormously creative and delicious. Combining Asian food with Cuban food doesn't seem to roll off (or down) the tongue easily, but it in fact bodes beautifully. I will certainly be back to explore their cocktail and chocolate menus... \"Thai Chilli cocktail encapsulated in chocolate? Yes please. Here's \u00a325 - impress me.\"",

The atmosphere was great, very modern, young and trendy. The food was edible and service was attentive and at times a bit too friendly and bill, however, was completely out of proportion. The food is fusion and generally very inventive but the quality was average. It was tasty and nice, but, in all fairness, not especially outstanding. The squid and artichoke salad was delicious a but it tasted like the chef shopped at Sainsbury's rather than spent time on selecting the freshest and best ingredients to get the best flavours. Service was very helpful and friendly. The waiters were very good at advising us on the wine and the courses. They were a bit overly friendly for my taste, as they were obviously required to act as if they were our life long best friend rather than waiters. I also did not like the fact that they felt like reinforcing this impression by touchingmy escort for the evening and patting him on the back as often as possible. Apart from that (and that is a matter of taste), they were extremely good and efficient. The bill was also a disappointment, coming at 70 pounds for 2 taking into account that we only had a glass of wine each, and shared desert). In total , a fun place to go to, but the food department needs a lot of work and really over-priced.",

Plus it attracts more than its fair share of try hards. Some people love that, but it's just not my bag to be surrounded by people who want so bad to be cool!The decor confused me, it was partly like a sort refurbished gym, partly like a cosy pub? It didn't work if you ask me. Vintage books and paraphernalia I get, but it didn't work with the stark floor and walls. The waiters were lovely but \u00a0lacked direction and leadership it seemed to me. For instance - they didn't note down who was having what, so would arrive with food at our table and have to shout the dishes to us, interrupting conversation and causing stress to everyone. It's a small thing I know, but it's what sets amazing service apart form average in my opinion. Now the food, I totally get fushion because I am from New Zealand the land of pacific/asian fushion. I didn't think they nailed it at all. The seared tuna with wasabi peas was DIVINE, cooked to perfection and amazing. But the sides completely didn't go, fried noodles, egg fried rice? It was all so ordinary in comparison. Also I loved the wasabi flavour with the tuna, but thought it was weird to use wasabi peas - they are like pub-grub to me now! We had a set lunch menu that was pretty well=-priced, so the cost wasn't so much of an issue. I wouldn't go again unless someone else (preferably some sort of faceless corporation) was paying. A girl's gotta eat!",

The rib eye is exceptional, although I beleive coffee is used in the preparation, which might have explained why I couldn't sleep later.

There are large pillars covered with pictures (of what looks like Cubans) and random pillars with flower pots hanging.. I loved the single hanging lightbulb as the light for every table (I tried to pull an Albert Einstein kinda picture by sticking my head under one to take a picture... Lol it did NOT turn out so well haha) Anyway, back to the topic... Food! When I first heard Asia de Cuba.. All I actually heard was CUBA... And my face turned to a look of disgust. If you've been to Cuba, you'll know what I'm talking about. The food in Cuba is horrible. Overcooked, tasteless, spiceless.. But I gave this restaurant a shot and boy I'm glad I did! It's definitely not traditional Cuban. We took all the waiters recommendations and started off with the Triple Berry Mojito and regular Mojito. I loved the triple berry more than the regular (less taste of alcohol) - tip: order it with a little less ice... They come served in Mason jars overflowing with shards of ice! Loved the drinks so much we decided to have another round of the same! As our starters, we got the Crab Croquetas and Thai Beef Salad. The salad I personally could have done without... But the crab croquetas and green mango slivers were amazing (remember to eat them while hot!) As our main, we shared the Cuban Coffee Crusted Rib-eye with sides of Lobster Boniato mash, Yuca Mojo fries, Bok Choy with roasted garlic. Our Coffee Crusted Rib-eye came perfectly cooked and had the right amount of flavor (although I couldn't taste any coffee...)... The lobster mash was amazing! Definitely worth getting!! The bok choy was probably next and the yuca mojo fries (cassava fries) didn't get any points in our books! For dessert we ordered tea (I got the camomile) and carrot cake... I usually love carrot cake and was really excited when dessert hit our table! Unfortunately.... It looks much better than it tastes! It has some weird ingredient in it that gives it a really odd after taste... After EVERY bite. I was not a happy camper..For two people our total came to just over \u00a3210.",

    "text": "I took a friend here for her birthday after we saw Twelve Angry Men at the Garrick (Great play, grotty theatre). We started off with a drink in the Light Bar (ginger and lychee Champagne) before going for a 6pm reservation into the restaurant. The restaurant is impossibly cool with trendy decor and extremely fashionable, yet friendly and fun waiting staff! We had the tasting menu, which I thought was extremely good value for money - through Top Table we got it with a glass of champagne for \u00a355 a head. (If you don't book through Top Table, then it is \u00a360 each with no champagne). \u00a0It was a LOT of food, and we had added in the ceviche tasting course too. We started with an amuse bouche of tuna tartare and sesame seeds on crackers, which were delicious. We then had the ceviche tasting plate - three different types of fish in different sauces with giant prawn crackers and plantain chips. This was actually my least favourite course, it was a bit too doused in lemon and coriander for me (coriander tastes like hand cream to me!) I love plantains, but the chips were a little like very very hard cardboard. The starter was calamari salad, crab croquetas and Braised oxtail and kimchee dumplings. My favourite was the crab croquetas, with a delicious dipping sauce. The salad was very nice, and I wasn't so keen on the dumplings, as the pastry was a little too crispy and felt just a bit underdone. We then cleansed our palate with a phenomenal mojito sorbet before moving on to the main course. Seared tuna on wasabi mashed potato and Cuban BBQ Chicken. Both glorious, although the tuna on wasabi potato was a revelation - absolutely perfect and soooooooo tasty! If I go back again, I may well just have two portions of that...We had a dessert plate that involved chocolate brownie things (a little too sweet for me_ some banana cake (yummy!) some ice cream (also yummy) and some Mexican doughnuts (my favourite). We washed it all down with the best viognier I have had in ages at a really reasonable price. Altogether it came to just shy of \u00a3200 for two of us to eat our own body weight in fantastic food and drink quite a lot of champagne and wine. It's not for an everyday experience, but for a very special occasion, it's absolutely fantastic.",

    "text": "Asia de Cuba is the restaurant of the St Martin's Lane hotel. If your ever having trouble locating it, look for a big yellow revolving door! It's a little above my usual price for eating out but as a treat it was well worth it. We were greeted with a smile and our coats put in the cloakroom for us and then seated. I love the decor of this place and it is a spacious room. Once seated we were offered water right away and the waiter explained the bottomless brunch options. While I was tempted to go for this option I hadn't budgeted for it so I fully intend to return in the future to try it. Instead I had breakfast from the fields with poached eggs and English breakfast tea. It was delicious. I cleared my plate. My dining companions and I decided to share dessert, Mexican donuts with caramel and thai chilli chocolate dips. You can have just one or the other if you prefer. The donuts came freshly prepared and had a little bit of sauce already in them. I like that is was just a little bit because it gives you freedom to add a little or a lot more yourself. A liked both sauces but I loved the caramel. This is one of my favourite brunches to date. If the waiter had been more knowledgeable on the selection of teas and fruit juices (they were not on the menu) on offer I would be giving it 5 out if 5.",

    "text": "First, it's hard to find this place because it has no sign outside, so I was expecting it to be nice inside. It was alright in terms of atmosphere and decor, but not that special. The service was good though although they do take a long time to bring the food. We tried the salmon pancake with ginger and scallion ceviche and it was ok, although the salmon wasn't particularly fresh and the pancake was thin and hard like a cracker. It was spiced interestingly though with latin-asian fusion way and we liked it although it wasn't that special. We had the scallions and the duck for starters and the scallions were spiced nicely too but the duck was not very memorable. I had the rib eye steak for the main and it was terrible, I had to search for meat because it was mostly fat, and it was really bland. The bok choy with garlic was decent and the yucca fries, but the steak was so bad and the food so expensive that I really don't think it's worth coming here just for a few spices drizzled together in an interesting way. Ok but not worth it.",

    "text": "Another really hyped place. Specializing in Rum based drinks and the asian-latin fusion food. Portions are very large here when compared to other places. Plus it's the restaurant in the hotel and it was only a matter of time before getting a meal here.Started out with two dishes for the group: SCOTTISH SALMON AND SALTED AVOCADO HELADO - nice and well balanced. A great starter to have.SPICY HAMACHI AND PLANTAIN THREADS - plantains were not as crunchy as I would have preferred as it would have been a great texture to have with the hamachi.My main was the CUBAN BBQ CHICKEN which was recommended from our waitress. It was a solid dish. Chicken was moist and bbq of the tamarind had nice flavor. Like I mentioned above, huge portions here and this is was huge. Definitely a good recommend. Props to her.Desserts equally are huge. Mexican doughnuts were good with butterscotch filling and sauce on the side. The Cuban Opera cake was also quite good, but you must be a chocolate fan for it. Overall a good spot but one of the more pricey places around. Weekdays are days when you can walk in and get a table. Weekend, then you'll need to plan ahead and reserve.",

    "text": "When I checked into the St Martins Lane Hotel at around 10:30, I was hoping that whatever restaurant they had would still be open. \u00a0To my pleasant surprise, it was Asia de Cuba and it was not only open, but also was buzzing with activity. \u00a0I was able to get a seat pretty quickly without a reservation and it seemed like a pretty good table in the middle of the dining room on the upper of the two teirs to the room. \u00a0In classic Morgans Group style, the room had high ceilings, white walls, with big round support columns, plastered with framed pictures. \u00a0 The crowd was upscale and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.My only complaint with this place was my wait when I was seated at the table. \u00a0I waited quite a while to be greeted by a server, but once greeted, the service was great. \u00a0I will chock it up to a miscommunication between hosts and servers. \u00a0My server, a charming Italian woman was excellent and made my travel-weary bones feel right at home.I started off with a glass of red wine. \u00a0One thing I noticed is that i found the wine list to reasonably priced for an upscale restaurant. \u00a0For dinner, I had the grilled strip steak with gingered chickpea fries and calabaza melon slaw. \u00a0Although I found the melon slaw to be a bit *meh*, the steak was excellent - grilled perfectly to order and the chickpea fries were very good as well - a sort of reminded me of a tofu tempura, except with actual flavor.I had a very good dining experience at Asia de Cuba - great food and great service. \u00a0It was exactly what I needed after a long flight.",

    "text": "I love places like this.Call me a design snob, but I appreciate the style detail in this place. I'll get to the food in the minute, and it is worth the wait in my view, but the style of this restaurant in the St Martins Lane hotel is what first hits you. It was designed by Philippe Stark which should tell you what it's like if you know anything about his incredible design work. It has different visual and tactile textures, it has sharp lines, impressive lighting and simple but powerful objects around the well designed seating to always give you a visual backdrop with lots of contrasts.The food is Asian fusion and is designed to be shared. There is a high percentage of fish in the menu, but there are good combinations of ingredients to provide some contrasts in the food as well. We had 3 starters between 4 of us, smoked salmon on thin Spring Onion pancakes along with some crispy octopus and some crab croquetas. All were delicious, the salmon was on wafer think crisp pancakes that made your mouth water.Mains we had Miso Black Code with Edamame mash (I'll come back to that little delicacy), Seared Ahi Tuna (\"I don't like Tuna unless it's excellent\" complained one of our crowd. He wasn't disappointed), and Cuban coffee Ribeye. All were incredible, cooked to perfection, enough to share with a little left over to tempt you with one more mouthful.the Black Cod was divine, and the edamame mash was something so simple, yet so incredibly yummy. The sort of thing that has you making little noises with each mouthful to give the game away.All in all, a stylish hang out with food that fits perfectly. For us it was \u00a3360 for the meal which also included deserts, water and wine for 3 of our party of 4. It isn't for everyday, but if you want a great meal in stylish surroundings in central London, you can't really go wrong.",

The tuna starter was an OK dish but not more, while the chicken on lemon grass skewers was bland and the chilli sauce tasted like it came from a jar. From there things went downhill. The honey glazed pork was almost too salty to eat and the salmon was of bad quality and overcooked. Saying that, the food was not too bad, still edible. The service on the other hand... The waiter decided to sit down at the next table while taking the order. The cutlery were dirty and after the starter they took the cutlery away without giving me any new ones. I wondered if they had received any training. On top of it all they ask for 15% service charge. Also, a bottle of still water was \u00a35, far more than I have payed in far better restaurants. Would not recommend it to anyone. There are many better places to go while paying the same amount and you would definitely be better treated.",

It's so trendy there aren't even any signs to help you find the place - which I found at the far left hand corner of the lobby of the unmarked St Martin's Lane Hotel, after the receptionist directed me with a knowing sigh that told me she does this ten times a day...I loved the decor - there's something about stacked bookshelves that just makes me happy, as does the colour yellow, so I was coveting most of it for my house! I thought the Asian/fusion posters that fill the side wall were also very cool.I also loved the service - I could have hugged our server Vicky she was so damn friendly. It helped that she was also seriously generous with the drinks - we went for the bottomless cocktails menu for \u00a348 with unlimited mojitos, bellinis, mimosas or DIY bloody Mary's, and Vicky was soon racking these up for us (whilst ensuring we drank responsibly obv)!The food was plentiful but just 'ok'. The starters were presented in a fun cigar box to share between two; some hits, some misses, great dips though. We each chose an a la carte main, which ranged from smashed avo on toast to duck confit and waffles, and were all quite tasty. Then bottomless Mexican donuts to finish, stuffed with choc and caramel sauce, which we were far too full to make good use of!I think we were all a little shocked when the bill came and listed just how many bellinis we'd gotten through (eek) but it was a fun treat for a sunny bank holiday weekend :)",

Ok, so that doesn't work as well as Sunday funday but seeing as we had brunch and I got to have a Bloody Mary, it seems quite apt.We had some trouble finding the hotel and the restaurant due to the lack of signs - I always just thought it was some offices above the Gymbox. Even once inside the restaurant it doesn't scream Asian/Cuban fusion... more library than anything else.But the food was good, as was the cocktails (apart from the first dodgy round). But the stellar thing here was the service. Probably amongst the best two or three waiters I've ever had serve me. Five stars on his own.We'll be back again, because the food/service makes the prices worth it. Also a Bloody Mary bar. Awesome.",

    "text": "Not one to normally go into town on the weekend, I miss out on the great brunch offerings London has to offer. So when I had to be at a work thing in the late afternoon anyway, it seemed like a great chance to come try Asia de Cuba's Bottomless Brunch.For around \u00a350, you get unlimited cocktails (from a choice of 4 - mimosa, bellini, mojito, bloody Mary), a selection of starters for the table, a main course, and unlimited doughnuts.I'm not much of a drinker but I do love a mojito, so I started with one. Holy cow, it was so strong - I think they missed something out (it had no lime taste or sweetness). When the waiter saw I wasn't drinking it, I explained I don't drink much alcohol and he immediately offered to start bringing me virgin cocktails, which I accepted. The best one was a quite sweet one with hibiscus flower (not floral, just delicious!)The food came quickly, with some black bean dip that's lovely. Then some ceviche which just isn't my thing. I tried it, but the fish was a bit thick and it was a bit much. Then the warm apps came, and the ropa de viejo spring roll was the best - so delicious - but everything was good. The mini Cubans were tasty (but not as great as the full-sized one my husband had for his main!). I didn't eat the chicarones as I'm not a fan of skin/fat but the taste of the bit I tried was spot on.By this point, I'm completely full. Then my main came - eggs Benedict Cuban style, with pulled pork. The 2 bites I managed were delicious.Then they brought doughnuts, which I somehow managed. They then brought more, which I did not! They were good, but not amazing enough to make myself sick over. ;)The service was FANTASTIC. I didn't catch our waiter's name, but he was friendly and charming and deserved the big tip we left.We did arrive quite late due to not being able to find it - apparently it's a corporate decision by the hotel to not have any signs outside denoting the hotel (it's the revolving door by the GymBox). Not sure why the restaurant didn't have any signs (come in to the hotel and walk to the back left of the lobby). Worth seeking out, if you have a couple of hours and a bit of cash to through around at a weekend!",

    "text": "Been wanting to go here for a while having walked past this pretty much every day for 3 years.Asia de Cuba is inside a hotel which is known to be frequented by the rich and famous. \u00a0Along with it's location, it can be a place to spot actors from the local theatres.Had a early booking at 6:30 pm and was warned that there was a 2 hour turnaround on the table which I am never keen on as, if they don't have a busy night they will happily let you sit there (which indeed they did) but if they were busy, we would have been kicked off which I feel makes a restaurant look like they are only interested in the financial aspect rather than the customers experience.Any how, we chose from the set menu. \u00a0I had the crab croquets which were tasty. \u00a0Lovely and crispy on the outside with fluffy insides served with a small fruity salad which helped keep it light. \u00a0The starter was cosmetically pleasing also.I then had the sticky chicken which was nice, of a decent size and with a light salad served with it also. \u00a0Again served cosmetically pleasing.Seeing that we were not being kicked off, I squeezed in a dessert which were half a dozen little donuts with a sauce. \u00a0My dining partner was not having dessert but we had the usual two plates and two spoons so we could share. \u00a0SHARE!!! SHARE my dessert??? \u00a0You must be crazy (told the waiter this also!). \u00a0They were tasty little light donuts and enough for just one, let me say that again, ONE person to eat :).Our waiter was very nice. He was friendly and helpful and had a little banter with us which made for an enjoyable evening. \u00a0Sometimes in 'up market' restaurants, the waiters can be a little 'aloof', but our waiter was great. \u00a0Although I didn't think the food was spectacular, I'd come again as we both enjoyed all of our dishes and the waiter made it an enjoyable experience and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant that night made for a good dining experience.",

The bottomless cocktail menu was very limited and there was only very \u00a0minimum alcohol \u00a0in the drinks. I had four of the \"Bottomless\" drinks and at the conclusion of our meal I felt as though I had not even had one cocktail.

    "text": "I was extremely excited when I learned about the best place - it combines my two favorite cuisines and the menu looked fantastic. But I was overall not as impressed as I wanted to be with the actual food. My impression is that many of the dishes do successfully combine both Cuban and Asian elements (and ingredients), but there is a difference between putting different things on a plate together and actually creating a different dish that combines the two cuisines. I had the red snapper ceviche, which was amazing. It was properly bathed in lemon juice and the chili added (only 'Asian' element) gave it a perfect kick. It was not an interesting new creation, but I would have it again any day. The second dish I had was the plantain fried rice. With a name like that, I was looking forward to having fried plantains cut up and mixed into the rice, but my imagination got the best of me. The plantains were not ripe enough and three slices were laid boringly on top of the rice. Looked pretty, but didn't live up to its name. The avocado ceviche that topped it as well is undermentioned in the name and was by far the best part of the dish. Service, once it got started, was excellent. The decor is interesting, but apart from the fantastic array of chairs and the bookcase, doesn't say much else, especially nothing else to do with the theme. I was hoping the books would at least be in Spanish or Asian languages, but that was not the case. Maybe some more artwork could do the trick. The centerpieces were lovely, so points on that.Overall, the place is overpriced for what it offers. You are paying more for atmosphere and location than for the actual food. Nevertheless, there are very few places in the world where you can find Asian and Cuban food in fusion, and I hope this place lasts and improves. Maybe I would go again.",

This was a nice change from the LA location where servers / hostesses can be quite snobby. Our waiter handled our party or 12 with ease, and was chatty and kind the entire evening.Ambiance: This restaurant is gorgeous. The decor is minimalist with a quirky twist.Food: Fabulous from start to finish. We ordered so many things so I'll just note the highlights (for me). Scallops appetizer, salmon, lobster mashed, plantain rice, and the sticky rice. I don't eat chicken but the BBQ chicken received rave reviews, as did the ceviche.We brought a cake from outside, which the hotel cut and served for us. For this service they charged 5 pounds per person, which seems high but maybe for London it wasn't? This was the only minor criticism I had the whole evening.Bottom Line: This restaurant is NOT inexpensive but the great food and service justify the high prices. I'm sure we will visit again soon!",

    "text": "I booked a table here as part of a recent trip down to London. The trip was part of a birthday celebration so I wanted to eat somewhere a little bit special. I picked Asia de Cuba for three reasons: the menu of Asian and Cuban fusion food sounded interesting, the location is great (wanted somewhere close to theatreland) and, of course, I'd read good things on here. On arrival the restaurant makes a great impression, sitting at the back of the extremely stylish lobby of St Martin's Lane hotel. The decor of the restaurant is clean and contemporary, the dining area dominated by rows of huge columns encased in black and white photos and old books. The service was great from start to finish, with really friendly and chatty staff who were attentive without being overbearing. Our waitress recommended a few dishes to us and talked us through the menu, she was always on hand if we wanted something. On to the food! We both ordered from the pre-theatre menu, which is quite the bargain at around \u00a327 for three courses (bearing in mind that main courses alone on the a la carte menu are \u00a321 and up). I went for the calamari salad, a house speciality, to start. It is really worth a try! Heaps of crispy salad sprinkled with lightly battered calamari rings, cashew nuts, banana and a zingy orange dressing. Adam S. went for the crab croquettes and whilst these were also very tasty the portion size was tiny in comparison to my salad. My palomillo of beef main was also very tasty; pan seared beef topped with fried onions and peppers and salad, with a peppery sauce. To finish I had the Cuban opera, a layered chocolate opera cake served with coffee mousse and icecream. We washed down our food with a couple of cocktails. I started off with a raspberry cloud caipirinha, which was bursting with raspberry flavour and really refreshing. After that I had a similarly refreshing triple berry mojito, perfect with my food. All in all, a really nice dinner in a lovely setting. I think that the pre-theatre menu is excellent value for money. I'm not sure, however, that I would be totally happy to pay full price. The food was tasty but for \u00a325-\u00a330 for a main course I would expect more wow.",
