    "text": "Franco Manca in Chiswick - Pics at The London Foodie(thelondonfoodie.co.uk ) Dr G and I recently went to the newly opened branch of Franco Manca in Chiswick with fellow food blogger Su-Lin of Tamarind & Thyme. Unlike the Brixton joint, the Chiswick branch is a real restaurant \u00a0it feels modern and casual with a massive mosaic-tiled, wood-burning oven dominating its entrance. I liked the simplicity and understated elegance of the d\u00e9cor, the long communal tables, and the uncluttered and airy space. Much has been said about Franco Manca, its slow-rising sourdough pizza base (minimum 20 hours), and the organic Italian or locally sourced ingredients (see Su-Lin's great review on Tamarind & Thyme). I was however still impressed to find how delicious their pizza dough was \u00a0this was for me the main event regarding Franco Manca. The dough was elastic with a deliciously chewy, dense consistency like good quality sourdough bread. The crust had been beautifully charred giving a woody, smoky flavour to the dough. Also impressive was how affordable Franco Manca's pizzas were, priced between \u00a34.50 and\u00a36.90. This is much better value than similar Neapolitan style pizzerias like Rossopomodoro or Pizza East. We shared three of the starters Aubergine alla Parmegiana, Garlic Pizza Bread and Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella. The aubergine was beautifully made, and so was the rather large garlic sourdough bread. The buffalo mozzarella was, in my opinion, not as sensational as the one I tried at Rossopomodoro, and the addition of tomato sauce to the mozzarella overpowered its delicate flavour. As for the pizza, Su-Lin and I went for Meat Special @ \u00a36.90 (wild mushrooms, wild boar, smoked buffalo mozzarella). This was very good, with a generous topping of mozzarella and mushrooms. The wild boar salami was also a nice addition. The pizza base was sensational, and the fact that it was a white pizza (with no tomato sauce) did not detract from the overall experience. Dr G went for a Number 5 @ \u00a36.80 (tomato, cured organic chorizo (dry and semi Dry), mozzarella). The tomato sauce tasted fresh and had probably been made on the premises. It was again a delicious pizza with authentic ingredients. We shared a bottle of organic Dolcetto \u00a39.20, this was a simple and rustic wine and although well priced, it was disappointingly of not very good quality. Su-Lin had a 250ml bottle of organic lemonade \u00a31.80, and we both wished we had ordered the same. Cost: around \u00a345 (\u00a315 per person) including a bottle of wine & service. Likes: sensational sourdough base, good quality & authentic ingredients, very affordable prices, and free filtered water. Dislikes: limited wine choices (only one red and one white option). Verdict: One of the best pizzerias in London, serving excellent sourdough pizza base at very affordable prices. It may lack the glamour of Pizza East or Rossopomodoro's central location but their pizzas are second to none and will set you back significantly less. Highly recommended. *Update* - Since writing this post, I heard from Giuseppe M. of Franco Manca, this is what he wrote: Many thanks for you kind comments. Since your visit we have changed the house wine (which was there only temporarely) and have replaced with an organic wine. This makes possibly the best value for money in London. The wine list also includes 5 reds and 3 whites now. We work with an organic farm in Italy and this is the new outcome. I sometimes hear from restaurants I review but I'd never had such positive response, thanks Giuseppe! The London Foodie on 2nd March 2010.",

I know there is a lot of Hype around this place, and we are a sceptical people, us Yelpers, but this place is TOTALLY BOMB.I don't like meat, but for those of you who dig on swine, the meat pizza was PORKTASTIC it has pepperoni, chorizo.. prosciutto... other meats that I can't remember. I think the crust was my favorite part. I wanted to roll my pizza up into a ball and make a pillow on it, and sleep on it everynight.There was an instant silence that fell over the table once we had all finished the meal. We all had a moment of silence for the Pizza's that we loved, and we mourned them and wished we had more pizza. but I honestly don't think i could have eaten anymore pizza. AND THE PRICE WAS AMAZING.DAMN YOU FOR BEING SO FAR AWAY. However, if you were closer, I would probably fantasize about a Pizza bed, and at \u00a36 a pizza, I might be tempted to make my Pizza bed dream come true.",

I couldn't step foot in W4 for until 2008, however Saturday night was another welcome return to the High Road as I hit the new boy to the Brixton ancestral pizzeria. The interior was a little naff I must say, however it was the modestly priced food and broad selection of recommendations that compelled me to visit. The slow-rising sourdough taking a mere 20 hours is the unique selling point. The veggie-friendly buffalo ricotta (I know, I thought it was mozzarella too but then again I'm a bad Italian) loaded with crisp zucchini made me very happy. I'd only comment on the house white being served in a tumbler, which made me grimace on arrival, but nonetheless went down a treat. A victory for value and taste.",

This Chiswick location gets the added plus(or minus for some) in that it seems more like a full sit down restaurant, rather than a quirky tasty add on to Brixton Market.Alan's 5 Slices Review SystemI've had many but I'll review my favorite. Tomato, Cured Organic Chorizo (Dry & Semi-Dry) and Mozzarella+1 (1/1) Crust- One of the best crusts of ANY pizza place I've been to, Italy and New York included. They use a very unique sourdough crust that is so soft and a bit doughie. Tastes like perfectly baked bread.+.9 (1.9/2) Sauce- Very simple sauce of what tastes of fresh tomatoes turned into sauce and a sprig of basil. What makes it great is how fresh it is how the flavor that comes from such simple ingredients.+1 (2.9/3) Cheese- Love the cheese. Nice and flavorful buffalo mozzarella. Always tastes so fresh. Not the weepy, waterykind, this kind keeps its flavor intact and lets the sauce do its own thing.+.8 (3.7/4) Toppings- Two very nice types of chorizo. One a flatter and one thicker. They flatter one looked a bit like salami or pepperoni, but had a classic chroizo taste. The thicker one was even more flavorful and juicy. Both extremely flavorful and authentic. +.8 (4.5/5) Atmosphere/Service/Price- The Chiswick is a much different atmosphere than the Brixton counterpart. It seems like a nice modern Italian sit down restaurant, while still keeping the great value. It is an astoundingly good deal for any of the pizzas, but the classic Margarita is only 5.50. If you can find a better deal in the ridiculously overpriced city of London, please let me know.Final Score:Franco Manca - 4.5 slices out of 5Best pizza place in London, probably the UK and in my top 10 of all time.",

Nothing mind-blowing or worth going out of my way for, certainly. Although, that being said, the prices are pretty amazing, so maybe it IS worth it. The best part of the meal though had to be the totally gluggable and inexpensive wine I got to go with it.",

Seriously. The only pizza I've ever had that has even come CLOSE to being this good was in Naples- no surprise as Franco Manca uses Neopolitan flour- and Zero Otto Nove on Arthur Ave in the Bronx. And the only reason I liked that place was because it reminded me of Franco Manca!You CANNOT beat this place for value for money- especially in London where most restaurants act as though they are doing you a favor by ripping you off in price and serving you sub-standard food by waitresses who don't speak English.Franco Manca, I adore you and your pizza!!",

    "text": "I used to live in Chiswick years ago when the high road was really boring and had nothing to offer apart from Pizza Express on one end of the scale and unaffordable nouvelle cuisine (this was the eighties after all ...) on the other extreme.Franco Manca is the latest surprise which forces me to reconsider my prejudices against this part of West London ...I went for a late dinner with an Italian friend the other day - she felt at home and I felt like being on holiday in Italy. All the staff are Italian and the food seems authentic, too. We also experienced some typically (!?) Italian chaos with partially missed orders and forgotten wine top-ups - but somehow this only added to the atmosphere.I like concise menues, and this one is just the right length - they also have changing specials, so you are unlikely to get bored. I also like restaurants which take pride in the origin of their produce, and Franco Manca ticks all the boxes.The sourdough pizzas were delicious (I like mine a bit crunchier, but I suppose this is the way it's meant to be) even if the toppings were a bit sparse. My friend asked for extra tomato sauce which was added without any hassle.I had a baked aubergine dish which was the perfect starter size - it was still sizzling when served.Meat eaters will probably be even more excited as there are loads of special types available.The wine list is lmited to a couple of organic varieties which are available in white or red. I like the fact they are served in tumblers rather than stemmed glasses - this goes with the general relaxed fell of the place.Meals in pizza joints tend to be over too quickly and most restaurants are in the fast food league as a result. I didn't feel rushed at Franco Manca, indeed we ordered another glass of wine to enjoy at one of the tables outside.",

I knew about the Brixton branch and had heard many, many people sing its praises, so we couldn't walk by the Chiswick branch without giving it a try. The pizzas are just wow. Yes, I'm using wow as an adjective. My prerogative. I went for pizza #6, the tomato, anchovy, caper, olive, garlic and mozzarella, with some fresh chili on top. It had a very good crust to pizza ratio (unlike Pizza East - boo! hiss!) and was just loaded full of flavour. I'm not a big crust eater, but I polished this bad boy off - it was soft, yet crusty, a nice balance. The pizza I went for could've been very overwhelming with all the strong ingredients, but it was just right, with a real balance of flavour. Worth the trip to Chiswick. True fact.",

    "text": "Praised as the best pizza in London by a ridiculous amount of people, I had to try it out. Amazingly, the Brixton branch is only opened for lunch, so me and my trusty foodie friend gritted our teeth and took the district line (boo) to Turnham Green (oh, I mean Chiswick? My bad), where a new, evening branch has opened. After fairly skipping into the resturant in excitment, we perused the menu. We decided to order two pizzas, sharing half each. We went for their Meat special (Parma ham, rocket and mozzarella on tomato) along with menu no.6 (mozzarella and chorizo on tomato). After a 20 minutes wait our pizza's were placed on the table. A good size, slightly flopping over the edge. Lifting up mine (I had first go at the meat special), I noticed the base was so thin you could see the light shining through. The toppings were absolutely delicious. Rocket, Italian style ham and shavings of grana padano are my new topping selection to emulate, Flavorful, filling but not stodgy at all. I could have eaten the whole thing. But sadly, I had already promised to share half with my slow eating friend. Over she handed her chorizo pizza, as regretfully I watched my delicious meat special float away. The chorizo pizza was sadly affected by being a little cool. Thin pizza gets cold pretty quickly. Despite this, and the curiously limited amount of cheese on the base, you could still taste the awesome potential of a pizza topped with melt in the mouth, greasy chorizo. It would have been far far better warm though, and that I truly believe. Overall, this only half lived up to the all encompassing hype. The meat special, though slightly more pricey, was worth every bite and was by far our favorite. Is it worth the long slow trek on the district line? No, not really. If only they had a branch closer to central London; but for now, they do not, and I probably won't make the effort to go there again. There are other places, maybe not as good, but not as far out either. In short, I loved Franco Manca, but hate the district line. I'm sorry.",

For dessert the choice is too much: my faves are the tiramisu, affogato (espresso over a scoop of vanilla ice cream) and polenta (fluffy cake made of yoghurt and raspberries drizzled in syrup and with a scoop of yoghurt!).",

Needless to say I'm shocked after the heavenly pizzas I've enjoyed at Franco Manca's original restaurant in Brixton. The pizzas I had at Chiswick were nowhere near the Brixton ones and comfortably inferior to those from any of the common pizzeria chains.There are some saving graces to Franco Manca's branch in Chiswick. One is the ice cream, which is surprisingly good. I also like the way that scoops are served in individual glasses, allowing the experience to be one akin to an ice cream tasting rather than a straightforward dessert. Another plus is the silky jazz in the background. The service though is a little mixed - sometimes quick, sometimes not so quick.Still, Franco Manca is first and foremost a pizzeria and loudly sells itself on that fact. So I think it most appropriate to rate its Chiswick branch on the quality of their pizzas. 'Meh, I'm still coming to terms with my disappointment', would sum it up.",

Mr Manca I must say you haven't got much of a selection, you should consider expanding on that.  Well I'am sad to say this but your pizza didn't blow my taste buds away. The pizza base was rather burnt on the sides, the ham....well the bits of it was just so-so. The tomato's and mozzarella I enjoyed... but the sourdough base did nothing for me, I suppose I like my normal pizza base (maybe you should give people that option of choice between the two).

I prefer my Francos experience to be within walking distance to my flat, to be full of people similar to myself (read: relaxed and not too fussy) and a little more intimate. The Chiswick Francos obviously isn't that. It's a trek to get here. It's a much, much bigger restaurant with a more formal feel, and when we visited on a Saturday lunchtime, full of families with kids. They were everywhere. Screaming, crying, throwing food and cutlery all over the place. (and that's just the parents... wheeeyyyyy)So if you're reading this, and have kids and want some delicious pizza, you can't do better than here. Because the pizza is still as good as the Brixton orginal and there is plenty of space for little Sebastian and Isobel to cause merry hell.That being said, you're less likely to have a long queue here and they do have some additional menu items to try out. I'll say it again though; still my favourite pizza in London. By a country mile.",

I've here three times in less than a month, always seated and served speedily. The pizzas are delicious ( I always go for the vegetarian or vegetarian house specials), their burrata starter melted in my mouth and their Sangiovese organic wine was worth it despite its tiny cup serving. All that and paying under 30\u00a3 \u00a0for a filling meal for you is definitely worth the full marks.",

That is authenticity at it's best!!  this was our cheapest meal while in London and one of the best as well, so good that I went twice while in town. Next time i'm in London Franco Manca will be my first stop for dinner or lunch.",

The sourdough base, in my opinion, is what gives Franco Manca pizza the edge on other pizzerias. \u00a0The base is always thin and soft, but just firm enough. \u00a0 The chili oil is also fantastic. \u00a0The heat is strong, but just right. \u00a0For a casual evening out, I would highly recommend Franco Manca. \u00a0I will definitely be back!",

I love that they stay open pretty late compared to other restaurants around because my group could only get together later in the night for dinner. The ambiance was casual and relatively modern. The space in the restaurant was a little bit tight and it was very narrow and deep. We grabbed a table in the back corner. It was pretty crowded which was a good sign, but also very loud.Our server was nice and checked up on allergies for our group as we requested. This restaurant is very careful with allergies. We started with one of their special starters of the day, \"Buffalo Mozzarella + Langhirano Coppa.\" It was a plate with thin cold cuts of cured beef with fresh mozzarella, arugula, and tomatoes. I really enjoyed this. I loved the cold cuts and the mozzarella. It tasted so fresh and was a nice little snack before the meal. For my meal, I ordered the pizza with Gloucester old spot ham (home cured), mozzarella, buffalo ricotta, and extra tomato sauce. I really enjoyed my pizza! I really liked the sourdough crust and I liked the fact that the crust was not too thick. I loved the ham and cheeses on my pizza as well. They didn't skimp out on the meat which was good. However, I did want extra tomato sauce on my pizza and I felt that they barely put tomato sauce on it. I still really enjoyed the pizza though!I thought that the prices were also very good. Overall, casual ambiance, friendly and careful staff, great prices, and great food! I would definitely recommend Franco Manca.",

    "text": "Apologies now for the long and boringly detailed review, it made me feel better!I had heard a lot of really great stuff about Franco Manca, but the higher you are in my expectations, the further you have to fall!There was only a small queue, which moved pretty quickly so that was fine. I had heard great things about the potato pizza, but unfortunately there wasn't on on the menu so I opted for the vegetarian spacial, with an extra potato topping (offered on the board). Our waiter said he would have to check this with the chef, who sent back the message that it was fine and so it was ordered, along with olives, garlic bread, burata, three other pizzas for my companions and a bottle of wine.The burata and the garlic bread came - no olives. By the time we asked about them we decided it was too late so just scrapped them - but not before our waiter had simultaneously looked confused about our question of the olives, whilst trying to blame the kitchen staff for not sending them over.The burata was absolutely DIVINE! And I am told that the garlic bread was tasty too. And the mild organic white wine was dangerously drinkable :)Time for our pizzas to be served, exciting! But our waiter came and said there was no potato left, even though the chef had okayed it earlier. So I was pressured into the garlic pesto (which was actually nice!), after saying no to the artichokes suggested by one of my dining companions (she had ordered extra for her pizza and was singing their praises! But I wasn't sure). We were promised free Limoncello for the table.Two of our pizzas arrived - all good.Mine arrived - no potato of course, but yes there was the garlic oil... and there were the artichokes I'd said no to. Oh well.And so we waited.And waited.And started eating at the insistence of the last remaining diner waiting on her pizza (coincidentally the one who was excited about artichokes).Eventually we managed to call our waiter over to ask whether the last pizza was coming. Again with the confusion and lack of recognition of the order (even though he had entered into discussion about it at the time), mixed with trying to blame the kitchen, saying they 'drive him crazy'. But, although she tried to say she wasn't even hungry anymore so not to bring the pizza, they brought it over. To their credit, they didn't charge us for it, which helped to rectify the situation.We ordered affogatos for dessert (they were great!), and the restaurant delivered on their promise of free Limoncello for the table. (This went further to rectify the farcical evening!)By the end of the night we had had another bottle of wine and to be honest found the whole thing quite funny. They took the artichokes from my pizza off the bill,so they really did rectify every mistake fully, and the food that we did have was all delicious and lived up to the high standards set by all my friends' previous rave reviews. I am sticking with a 3 for this review just because of the service but I will be returning and I have no doubt that my updated review will result in a higher score!",

We enjoyed approximately 20 minutes of fading daylight before the skies opened up and unleashed a torrential downpour. Ducking into a bookstore, we decided to see what the trusty Yelp app had to say about dinner. Behold, Franco Manca. I love it when restaurants cut the bulls*** and just focus on a few things they can do well. This place does pizza, and does it very well. Forget 4 pages of mediocre Italian, Franco Manca gives you just a few starter choices and 4-5 choices of pizza. One size fits all. We ordered a mozz started which was awesome, and said no to the house wine in favor of fresh lemonade. The pizzas were awesome. Cooked to perfection in a woodfired oven, with a delicious bubbly sourdough crust and the perfect amount of toppings. We enjoyed the ham, and also the chorizo. ::kisses tips of fingers::. Delicious!Service was attentive and friendly, and I almost laughed when I saw the bill. I think we walked out spending about \u00a310 a person. If it wasn't so, so far from me I'd be in here all the time. Thank you for the refuge Franco Manca, keep on keeping on!",

They have moved most of the picnic tables to the back of the restaurant and placed a sleek row of two-tops in their place. A nice touch as it makes the space feel bigger. The problem with this new seating arrangement is that they did not move the coat hooks which are attached to the wall. The coat hooks are now either behind a chair or so close to the chair belonging to the table next to yours that you don't feel comfortable hanging your coat on said coat hook.Nothing has changed with the rating - still four stars. Also still no change with their menu though you can technically build your own pizza by ordering a pizza (e.g. the cheese, basil, and tomato) and then adding on toppings (where your topping selection are the toppings from the other pre-defined pizzas on the list). I still wish they had pepperoni or even created a menu that was a bit more user friendly. I don't know, something just seems off with the way their menu is laid out.My husband and I had excellent service this time around. Job well done!",

I always go for the chorizo with extra rocket, he always goes for whatever is on special that day. The sourdough is excellent and I feel full and satisfied afterwards. I've also been to the tottenham court road branch and the service is great at both. Really one of my favourite pizza places and generally places to eat in London!",

    "text": "Stopped in here for a quick lunch; and indeed I was not disappointed with the speed at which our food came.In terms of choices; it is quite limited with six options of pizzas but I do bare in mind any alterations can be made. But with extra topping choices; for a pizza place I did find it limited. The first time my husband has asked for onions and they didnt have it. onions. I tried the pizza with the ricotta, courgettes, mozzarella; added chillies and tomato sauce. Really tasty and filling. For the price totally worth it. My husband had the margarita pizza with chillies and He wasnt disappointed. All in all; the kick of why this pizza is so tasty simply comes down to the pizza dough. The toppings etc cannot say I havent had better; but the sourdough base is the kicker here and its evident from the first bite to last. Definitely worth a visit. Great taste. limited options.",

    "text": "I love the concept at this restaurant: complete transparency. You can see the pizza being made in front of you if you sit at the front of the restaurant, and there are details \u00a0on the origins of all the ingredients on the back of the menus.I ordered a personal pie with British cured ham, mushrooms, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese. The dough was fluffy and charred to perfection. No complaints about any of the ingredients. On each table were two types of olive oil which were perfect for dipping a little of the crust into.The service was quite attentive too; all I had to do was look up and a server was there as soon as he or she finished the task at hand.To top it off, the prices were extremely reasonable.",
