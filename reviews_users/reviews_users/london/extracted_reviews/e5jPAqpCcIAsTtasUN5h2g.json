Everyones food was good with the exception of mine, I order schnitzel for some reason, which was average, I was left feeling a little cheated by myself for ordering such a stupid meal. . . . but that was my own fault! Would go again, but, this time for breakfast as many other reviewers state.",

Service is relaxed and friendly but highly efficient. The building is remarkable and atmospheric. the restaurant was full but not intrusive, great atmosphere.",

But it should be kept as a special place, otherwise it will probably lose its charm. The decor is wonderfully old school and smart and the crowd here are really interesting to sit and watch! I had afternoon tea next to Bill Nighy the last time I was here - I couldn't quite hear what they were saying (sounded interesting though!) and I didn't want to get noticed for earwigging! A brilliant place for Sunday brunch - but call up and book far in advance. During the week if you get here early and want breakfast, you don't need to book because can go into the little side room where they serve the same food. You need to book for the main room though. A lovely really English place that I always come out of feeling lucky that I live in London.",

It's all about the atmosphere. The breakfast is lovely, every detail of it. A London classic.",

Not convinced that having a bottle of Heinz tomato sauce on the table would live up to my definition of posh, particularly surrounded by all the silverware though! Could have been decanted into a nicer serving dish! I had a pastry to start, followed by a full breakfast whilst my partner also had a pastry and Eggs Benedict, which he said was wonderful.

First time I had a superb Wiener Schnitzel with potato mash. The meat was so tender that I could cut it with my eyes; the fried coating so light and still tasty; the mash was perfection, the stuff of The man who ate everything, if you catch my drift.Breakfast was also very nice, with nice eggs, mushrooms, bacon and sausage and black pudding.Normally I wouldn't eat the latter; however at the Wolseley I decided to try and in fact it was worth: it's absolutely delicious, very delicate.The breakfast is also very very nice and worth a visit.The menu has many many more interesting entries that I could have possibly sampled.Service is ok in my experience. However upon booking you're told how long you can keep the table from when the booking starts; something that a lot of people might find off putting. For that kind of people it's recommended to avoid busy times, book an advance and arrive on time.",

    "text": "Ah, the Wolseley. Sophisticated yet unpretentious. Grand yet unassuming. The Wolseley had been on my list for a very long time, so I decided to finally frequent it a few days after my birthday, as a belated birthday treat. For all the finery and the fantastic service, breakfast is quite reasonably priced. The interior is even more impressive than its almost formidably grand exterior, with checkered marble floors, vaulted ceilings, and arched entryways. The waitstaff are all impeccably dressed and the menu is fantastically organized, inspired by European breakfast items (Croque Monsieur and Madame) but with chiefly English accents (Eggs and Soldiers). I, of course, had the Eggs Florentine. Definitely the best I've ever had, and I would know as that is usually my go-to breakfast item if a restaurant has it. I liked the extra sour zest in the Hollandaise to balance out the starchy muffin and the neutral eggs. \u00a0There are of slightly heavier items options, including muesli and French toast. In fact, I already know what I will get the next time I go. And there will be a next time. I will be having the Potato Rosti with Avocado, Tomato, and Hen's Egg. The thing I really enjoyed about this Ritz Hotel neighbor is the fact that it is actually quite relaxed in it's dining attitude. Though the majority of the crowd at 9am sharp were business breakfast bound, there was a younger crowd dressed almost sloppily and it seemed to usher no second thought in anyone. There was a complete blending, a warm buzzing conversational energy. It was just loud enough to have to lean in to speak but not so loud that you were left yelling at your eggs. Just a complete harmony.I am normally quite a hard sell, and would have veered on granting 4.5. But at the end of the meal, my lovely companion offered to pay for the meal as a birthday treat- at which point the waiter overheard and wished me a happy belated. He disappeared and when he returned, he had in hand an adorably packed item, which turned out to be a Danish with a 'Happy Birthday' marzipan accent. Sold. Lifetime customer.",

    "text": "Probably one of my favourite restaurants in London, and always a go-to for a quick breakfast or lunch while shopping or something more special for a special occasion. Let's start with breakfast, absolutely spot on every time. Great choice and variety, top quality as always and a really reasonable price. Eggs Benedict, pancakes and kedgeree are always a popular choice with my groups. Lunch is great too, can chose from the bar menu for more simple dishes, such as sandwiches, brunch dishes or burger. Or can go for the al a carte, with a great selection of seafood, oysters or a choice from the grill. I always find myself going for the croque Monsieur and a side of fries and a glass of chilled champagne when I fancy a delicious simple lunch. The afternoon tea is absolutely amazing too! Really good price compared to it's competitors, but personally, it's as good if not better than some like Fortnums. The cakes always vary; and you can request more of some or less of others if you fancy! The scones are always warm and fresh, and the sandwiches are divine. I think what really makes the afternoon tea is the very classical and relaxed atmosphere, in the amazing surroundings of an old car showroom. It's grand but accessible atmosphere, is on par with it's spectacular service. Very attentive and polite. The one minor problem is that as with many busy restaurants in London, there is a turnover of tables, so if you occasionally run over your 2 hour time period and they need your table, then can tend to start to usher you along, but still with manors and not throw you out! Dinner is great, again can choose from both menus, I'm sure they will pretty much do what you want there really, very flexible. There is a great wine list, and the cocktails are great! Overall, would definitely recommend for breakfast, lunch and dinner! \u00a0And tea too if you fancy!",

    "text": "Two of us had dinner here. \u00a0We didn't realise there was a separate vegetarian menu, they seem to have a lot of menus, so we had a limited range to choose from. \u00a0We had tomato soup for starters, which was delicious, in the same way a tin of Heinz is if you were to add as much butter to it as they did.Main course was fish for both of us, and it was very good but not really memorable. \u00a0We ordered some of the lower end wines and they were both very good. \u00a0Dessert was certainly the best course by far. \u00a0My friend had the passion fruit meringue pie, which was first-rate, perfectly done and my blackberry and apple crumble hard to criticise apart perhaps for the way it was kind of slopped onto the plate.That would have all been fine, it was all good stuff, but it came to more than one hundred quid. \u00a0We had a voucher that we received as a gift that covered most of it, so I didn't mind, but you are clearly not only paying for what they put on your plate:The service was fantastic. \u00a0Entirely friendly and helpful, just the right amount of it too, though they must still have the till system from when it was a car showroom in the 1920s because the waiter spend a long time trying to produce a bill. \u00a0And the decoration is lavish. \u00a0I really liked being there. \u00a0Their menu is quite interesting; I'd love to know if they can do a proper Wiener Schnitzel and the breakfasts look amazing. \u00a0In summary, I'm glad I've experienced it but the food was not quite good enough. \u00a0I hope to come back to try the breakfasts.",

Beware of costs--pricey and not a normal tourist destination. The inside of the building is just beautiful. \u00a0Wood, brass, dark marble. What a treat.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like The Wolseley - or at least the afternoon tea experience - but it looks like I sadly set my expectations too high. My friend and I had reservations for afternoon tea at 4:45 pm on a Sunday, and my first impression of the place was: wow. There was a doorman who kindly opened the door for us, and the reception was extremely courteous, seating us right away. I ended up getting the afternoon tea with green tea, and about 5 minutes later our tower/tea came out - so definitely a plus for the quick service. Unfortunately, it went downhill from here since the food - overall - was just not satisfying. The sandwiches were mostly bland, except for the celery one which was served inside a delicious tomato-flavored bread. The salmon sandwich was alright, too, but I would've preferred a bit more salmon to enhance the taste. The desserts weren't amazing either, with the exception of the New York cheesecake which was PHENOMENAL - the perfect creaminess and flavor. The other desserts proved to be less satisfying, especially the Battenberg which was quite dry and was coated with an artificially-orange-tasting marzipan. The tea was also pretty disappointing, as it did not taste fresh at all. It left a bitter taste on my tongue, which I found doesn't happen with higher quality tea leaves. Fortunately, I did at least thoroughly enjoy the scones + strawberry jam. The scone was warm upon being served and had a wonderfully fluffy interior. The jam though - oh my god - that was by far the best part. It tasted SO good - especially with the warm scone - and I probably devoured more than half of the jam they gave us.Overall - weighing all aspects of my experience - I thought afternoon tea here was just ok. The presentation and setting were beautiful, but the service felt a bit brisk and the food was generally disappointing.",

    "text": "So my friend just popped back for a week from Hong Kong and she was raving on about the cheesecake from this place. We scheduled a last minute meeting for tea here, although we did try to book first. My friend was told that it was fully reserved but we can try to walk in.Lo and behold, counting our lucky stars, when we walked in at 430pm on a Saturday they found a spare table which they need back at 6pm for dinner, and we thought why not, 1.5 hours are quite sufficient for tea, so we were seated.The decor of the place is pretty grand but you are not charged extortionate prices for the pleasure, which was of course, very pleasurable ;) I opted for a cream tea which consisted of 3 scones with the normal clotted cream and strawberry jam and went for Darjeeling tea, and my friend asked for Earl Gray with a slice of cheese cake.The food was good but nothing spectacular. While I thought the cheese cake tasted pretty average, maybe excelling at being more smooth in texture than usual, I wouldn't really say this is a thing to die for. The scones were also pretty much what one would expect, although I really appreciate the place giving me plenty of clotted cream and jam to slather generously over my scones. Nothing like not enough toppings to go around to spoil your mood right? I have had a look at the afternoon tea which includes the sandwiches and also other desserts, but it didn't really strike me as that much more fanciful than other high tea places. Now if they were doing super cute themes like in the Landau (i.e. Valentines theme, Fashion week themed cakes/desserts), I would be more tempted to give this more stars. Service is good, the decor is good, the food is so so, therefore this place gets a 4 stars from me!",

I dressed down (really down as I was tired on a night out the night before) so when I arrived at a place like The Wolseley, I felt like a tramp! =) They didn't treat me any different to the other well presented customers. I've always gone for the Egg Benedict. I've had others Egg Benedict in various different places but I have to say that it is incomparable to the one done here. The hollandaise sauce was perfect. It can't get any better.Their croissants & other pastries are very delicious too. Their hot chocolate is not made from syrups unlike many places I've been to and chain coffee stores. If you would want to try this place out, you should make a reservation online. You might end up having to wait in the bar until a seat is available as it does get busy. Fear not! They will still get you tea/coffee/fresh juice whilst you wait to be seated. There is a turnaround of 2 hours per table.I love this place!

This is my third visit here, the first two for a spot of breakfast and now for my birthday luncheon. This restaurant is perfect to mark a special occasion, and serves classic British cuisine. The interior looks lovely and the building is Grade II listed. Once a motor showroom for bankrupt Wolseley motors, and then later a Barclays Bank, the Wolseley has retained it's beautifully high ceilings and Japanese lacquered style from the twenties.The atmosphere is great, the staff are helpful and not too pretentious. They did accidentally mix up my chicken soup with chicken salad, but all is forgiven as they were so apologetic and quick to rectify. They also gave me free chips with my yummy fish main-course to make up for it (I am blatantly so cheap to win over - probably should have asked for free champagne right?). The chicken soup was a nod to Jewish cooking with matzah balls, and to add to that you could even get it served with a salt beef sandwich if you desired. The soup was pretty good, but sadly not as good as grandma's.Fantastic place. It is quite pricey but if you order carefully and forgo the alcohol you can eat here without the need to sell off the silver.Best birthday evs.",

My friend and I ordered some combo which comes with dessert and your choose of tea. the place is very elegant and classic. Price is reasonable.. the combo my friend ordered was only 20gpd ( typically it cost 30gpd-40gpd) for a place like that. Keep in mind this is a famous place so you may want to make a reservation in advance I had great experience here.. i think Americans should start this afternoon tea tradition too",

The W delivered !Delicious meal, followed by yummy dessert. The only thing I would criticise is the ma\u00eetre d's attitude when we walked in. You have to field the necessarily snobbish, \"do you have a reservation?\" at 6pm; but then his rather heavy-handed, \"I will need this table back by 7:30 Madame\" - I was all obliging smiles and courtesy, but HONESTLY!! Do I look like some sort of lothario who's going to sit in this little 2-seater booth ALL NIGHT, with my 11-year old son?? It's Monday people! Puh-leezI wish you could enjoy the ENTIRE experience.

We came here on a Friday night at around 930. The place still was packed and people still kept pouring in. We didn't have a reservation but they managed to give us a table. Decor is opulent, grand, matching the historic building. It is noisy an the atmosphere is buzzing. the crowd is totally mixed, you will see tourists in shorts and flip flops, but also women wearing evening gowns and gents in tuxedos. Service is good, knowledgeable, friendly and attentive. Even when it's packed they keep their cool.They have a nice wine list including a good selection of wines by the glass.The food served here is classic and traditional, concentrating on French and British cuisine. I was surprised how good the quality of the food was, ingredients were fresh, everything cooked to perfection. I will make sure to come back and make a reservation in the main dining hall. This should top the experience I already had.The Wolseley is sure expensive but worth every penny!",

The ingredient quality is fabulous so the simpler the better so the taste shines through. The biggest attraction here though is the amazing atmosphere and the big room itself.

And, there are many fresh juice options, such as Pineapple, and Carrot & Ginger.My husband and son both loved the Haggis and Eggs.I loved that they had small (1 egg) and large (2 eggs) Eggs Benedict options. One egg is enough, for me, and I always feel so wasteful, or overly stuffed, when there are 2. The Eggs Benedict was delicious.It is a pretty place, to have a meal. There is a very relaxing atmosphere, although it is higher end.",

    "text": "This was my first experience having afternoon tea. We did not have a reservation and did a walk in with 4 people. We waited for about 30-35 mins which was not bad considering the entire restaurant and bar area was packed. Originally they wanted to seat us in the bar, but I didn't feel like sitting in the bar while having tea (the atmosphere felt too rushed), we asked the host if it was possible for the dining area and he was quick to say no. After speaking with one of the managers they were kind enough to seat us but we were told we had to be out by 6pm since that table had a reservation already (figured 90 mins was plenty of time to enjoy our tea). Our server was friendly and quick to serve us. We did not get the champagne and ordered the regular tea option. The scones and strawberry jam were delicious, the other pastries were not that great in my option. There was a variety of cheese cake and yellow looking cake with some chocolate mousse but they were too sweet in my opinion. The little sandwiches served was also good, but really anything extraordinary for what we paid but ok. I think I would of been happy ordering 2 types of 2 and just scones. Not to mention we ordered the Wolseley blend and didn't think it was that strong, next time we might just go with the Early Grey or think it was English Breakfast option. Again the experience was fun and the service was good, but a bit pricey for the food options I think, but then again it is London so everything seems to be overpriced. We payed around 75 pounds ($120) for 4 people.",

We had one order of the traditional tea with the tiered platters, finger sandwiches, etc and the my mom just got a plain cup of tea. Dad got the cream tea which just was tea and scones. Plenty of food for all of us if not more than we needed. Great pastries, lots of tea to choose from, and great service.

I suppose it was about time.We reserved for 5:45 (last slot for afternoon tea). We were greeted very warmly and although we had arrived about 10-15 minutes early our table was ready for us. They offered a coat check, and a coat rack near our table however as we had plenty of space we kept our jackets with us.Our waiter, just to start with, was brilliant. I never caught his name but he was on top of everything and was great in all his services. The kind of waiter whom even when he is focused on one table is still looking out for the others.I decided to order The Wolseley Imperial (note: the actual menu is much more extensive than what is available online). It was delicious, sharp, chocolatey and decaffeinated all at the same time. It came with a chocolate and a very small glass of water. As my gf will definitely review about her experience I'll skip out on that, but I will tell you that the tea sandwiches, sweets and scones (+clotted cream & jam) that came with hers were all scrumptious and served elegantly. Our waiter was even nice enough to bring me out an extra plate when he saw I was sampling from her selection.Afternoon tea is fun.",

    "text": "So this is really a two part review. The first time I went to the Wolseley was for afternoon tea and I thought it was a five star experience. \u00a0Waiting in the bar before being seated eating the delightful cheese puffs and drinking champagne it just felt really fun and swanky. The tea itself was really good and I thought a great value for money. \u00a0I totally recommend going there for tea and when people come to visit this is a destination that I recommend. The second time I went was for dinner, it was an overall disappointment. \u00a0Probably because my tea experience was so first rate I had really high expectations, unfortunately the expectations feel disappointingly short. \u00a0I ordered the Sole, one of my favourite fish dishes, and it just lacked flavour. \u00a0Service was okay, but not super efficient, and to top it all off it really aggrieves me to pay a cover charge. \u00a0I totally understand restaurants needs to cover their costs, but I would prefer paying a little more for my meal than having a cover charge attached, it feels like a slap in the face. On the continent I am more forgiving of the cover charge, but to date the Wolseley is the only high end restaurant I've been to where cover attaches so it's not the norm. \u00a0I will be back for afternoon tea, but it is not a dining destination for me for dinner.",

    "text": "This review is for breakfast only. We made a booking here based on a friend's recommendation. Little did I know that she had only come here for tea, and not breakfast! On a Friday morning, the restaurant was bustling with businessmen (and women). We even saw one businessman whose secretary came in late but immediately pulled out her notebook and furiously started to take notes! (How oldschool)!Hubs and I really wanted to try some classic English breakfast food, so he had the English Breakfast and I had the Eggs Benedict (with ham). I ordered the large, and that was the typical size I'm used to, which comes with 2 halves of an English muffin, the poached egg, ham, sauce, and nothing else. I imagine the small only comes with one muffin. The English Breakfast was a bit more exciting and we both really enjoyed the black pudding, which we've never had before. Overall the food was pretty good, but very pricey with no \"WOW\" factor. They charge you the same, i.e. an arm, for an Americano (they don't offer filter coffee) or other espresso drinks, which is weird to me. The Americano was drinkable, to say the least. I should have had a latte instead so that the milk could help cover up the taste. I was also surprised that the service wasn't that great even though they charge pretty high prices. The servers really weren't all that attentive and we had to flag them down for everything. Another weird thing is that shortly after sitting down, one of the hosts came up to my booth, reached behind my back to grab my umbrella, saying that another customer had left it, and started walking away with my umbrella! I think normal people would ask if it's OK to look around the booth where I'm sitting and also ask if the umbrella is mine. How many millions of Londoners carry a black umbrella on a rainy day?!I probably wouldn't come back here, for breakfast or any other meal. I really don't like pay high prices for average service or less.",

Only one of our scones were fresh but the contrast it drew from the others that were hard as rocks was startling enough for us to request they be taken away. One of our party of 3 actually was a baker and an afternoon tea enthusiast and noted her scones only ever get that hard after they've been sitting be out for a few days. Beyond stale scones, getting the attention of waiters was nearly impossible and even when we finally did, it took a second request for hot water and another 30 minutes before it came. The automatic service tip included with the bill for such terrible service was insulting. The Wolseley seemed like a promising alternative to the ritz, which is next door, however, if you really want the classic afternoon tea experience, don't do it here. Spend the extra \u00a310 and go to the ritz.",

Nevertheless, we were willing to pay the going price of 37 pounds for the afternoon champagne tea at this generally well-reviewed former auto showroom.The room is, as noted, elegantly appointed, aspiring to the grand cafes in Paris and Vienna. And after being graciously welcomed, we were prepared for the fantasy to continue. But this was not to be. We were brought down to earth almost immediately by the fact that for some reason, we were among the few tables that were left bare without a tablecloth. When we asked for one, it was dutifully unfurled, with considerable help on our part. We were also surprised by the presence of paper napkins when other tables were laid out with cloth. Again, our request was rather peremptorily fulfilled. Maybe it was a sign of superior staffing, but we found ourselves confused by the fact that we were waited on by at least four different people, though it was difficult to find anyone who actually paid much attention to us. Water glasses were left unfilled and teapots unrefreshed. \u00a0The food was fine and we were impressed by the beautiful tea tray and specially designed tea strainers.But frankly, for 37 pounds we expected much more attentive service. And a more enjoyable \"afternoon tea\" experience.",

    "text": "I had dinner here tonight with a group of friends, latish, around 9:30. Since we had not booked a table ahead of time, we had to wait, which was fine and what we expected. We found a space at one of the bars and had a very nice cocktail, and the bartender was happy to explain the details of the drink we chose, and yes, it was indeed quite tasty.Once we were seated, we were not quite as happy. Our waiter was slow in getting to our table, but once there, he was able to recommend a nice wine for one of my friends, and was quite able to explain the various menu choices. \u00a0Once he took our order, however, it was quite a while before we saw our food. We were not served all at the same time - one friend had to wait and encourage us to eat our food before it got cold, rather than waiting for him to be served. Once we were all eating, our drinks glasses got empty and stayed empty until we managed to flag down a passing waiter and get some more. The food we had was quite good, and we really enjoyed it. I started with the escargot, which was served too hot - but once it cooled down I fell in love with the garlicky buttery goodness of it. \u00a0I had the grilled trout, and it was delicious. \u00a0Two friends tried the kedgeree, and said that it was quite good. The fish special (it was Hake tonight) another colleague had was deemed OK but rather bland. But, we were very frustrated with the inattentive service. When paying top dollar for an evening out, we expected to be treated better than that. We actually had to go find our waiter to get the check so that we could leave. And that is the only reason I knocked their review down from 5 stars. I would actually have knocked it down to 3 stars, but.....they redeemed themselves with the dessert. DO NOT SKIP DESSERT! IT IS FABULOUS! I had the treacle tart, which was sweet, but tempered by the side of slightly bitter cream. Oh yum! It was so good. One friend had the \"Pot of Chocolate\" which he said was divine. \u00a0The chocolate \u00e9clair was exquisite as well, and don't hesitate to try their ice cream dishes. All wonderful. This made up in large part for the inattentive waiter.So - if you can put up with the poor service, this place is worth going to. Just go when you have plenty of time and keep on top of the waiter if he is too slow.On the way out, the doorman called a cab for us, which was a lovely touch, and greatly appreciated. I'd be willing to give them another try to see if the service improved - maybe we just hit it on an off night.",

Fabulous.Located on Piccadilly, next to the famous Ritz Hotel, proudly stands The Wolseley. I was impressed instantly. Its a very grand, high ceiling, swanky establishment. which I felt, strangely, quite New Yorkesque. The staff were smartly dressed, uber helpful (even seated us though we were 20 mins early for our reservation). I strongly recommend booking. It was packed. It was a Monday morning but absolutely nothing felt 'Monday morning'. Everyone was glam, I sat next to a Hermes Birkin for heavens sake. Which leads me to say,seating is relatively tight but I felt it added to the ambiance and lively buzz. The food. I had two boiled eggs and soldiers. Which were cooked to perfection, obviously organic and large in size. Winning. Exactly the right amount of soldiers too. Was also well presented. Gush gush gush. Other half had a sausage sandwich with relish. He didn't speak whilst devouring it which always indicates he's in heaven. At the end, he declared 'it smashed it'. Great with words is my boy. The staff also brought over a birthday double choc brioche (mentioned 30th bday when booking). Epic. And obviously on the house. I will dream about that beauty for a long time to come. Yum.Now, the bill arrives. This whole jaunt, latte, apple juice and water,came to 20 English pounds. Including service. You'd pay more in a rubbish service station!!! Hubs will mention this fabulous priced meal to day he dies, as he loves a bargain (slight Jewish heritage). We will come back again. And again. And again. I want afternoon tea next. And then dinner....we looked at steak prices too...still really good value. Swoon.",

I've come here twice for breakfast this trip and both times I've walked away kind of meh about the food and experience. Had the eggs Benedict the first time - it was good, VERY fresh eggs! (Although one of mine was over cooked) Ordered the large which is the normal portion size but it's much more filling because the muffin they use is quite thick and heavy (didn't love it) - for sure could have gotten away with a small that day. Also had a cappuccino which was nothing great (TRAVEL TIP: go to MONMOUTH for the best cappuccino you may have ever had. They said best coffee in London but it may have been my best ever. It def. put up a challenge for even cappuccino in Italy!) The next visit I had the French Toast and my bf had the Crispy Bacon Roll with Fried Egg. Mine was just whatever - nothing to write home about but not bad. My bf really liked his sandwich - I tried it - it was good but again - nothing special. To drink I had the hot chocolate with whipped cream which LOOKED amazing but again, fell short for me. Also the second time around the service was kind of whatever. The first time was fine though. Both days we did not have a reservation, we were able to just go in and be seated.",

That's what I like about those kind of places. Yes they're posh and luxurious but everyone can go in (I saw tourists with giant backpacks).The place is really luxurious, the waiters are over polite and the choice for breakfast was amazing: Traditional british, baskets of bread, viennoiseries cooked on the premise, all the eggs you can wish for...I had avocado mash on toast and a cappuccino. I am ranking those 2nd on list. They were delicious (but lacking feta in my taste). Coffee was a bit blend, but I like really really strong coffee.Overall a good experience, just a tiny bit pricey (my breakfast cost me \u00a317, ouch)",

Hands down the #1 recommendation was always The Wolseley. Everything was impeccable from the reception staff who accommodated a table change, to the knowledgeable server, who never made us feel rushed, to the iconic and stately interior to the food, which was cooked to perfection.I had a large Salad Nicoise and my friend had the Wiener Schnitzel and french fries. Everything was cooked to perfection and washed down with a gorgeous bottle of Bordeaux. In fact, we enjoyed the place so much that we returned later in the afternoon for another bottle of wine.I would highly recommend the Wolseley and will make a point of dinning there every time I am in London.",

The waiter was annoyed and got the cook to come and see me. He warned me that he would do it but only for that only time! The whole experience was weird and unpleasant. I would not recommend.

    "text": "I left London over a week ago and all I dream about is tea and scones. I absolutely LOVE love love The Wolseley.A couple friends and I had planned for afternoon tea after doing a few touristy things and shopping on Bon Street. Since we didn't make a reservation (the place is packed, I suggest you do), it was about a 25 minute wait for three. They asked us to wait in the bar area which was great for chatting and sipping on whatever libations until our table was ready. While small, the bar had great energy and was chill.By the time our table was ready, so was my tummy. We ordered tea for two even though there were three of us. If you ask, they will make your sandwiches vegetarian (no crust, because that's how they do). The earl grey and darjeeling tea were both sooo good, I couldn't decide which one I liked best. Presentation here totally makes the experience. Not only do you get three tiers of delicious noms, clotted cream and fresh jam on lovely china, but your tea comes in a silver set- completing the experience.The scones. I'm drooling just thinking of them. These scones are absolute perfection. Take one, cut it in half, pile on the clotted cream with a dab of strawberry jam, and take a small bite. I promise you will want to wolf this down, but don't. Savor the flavor, texture, warmth, and crumb. They also don't start making them until 3:00pm which means they are as fresh as you can get. After eating these scones, when eating others you will always seek the same perfection. Nothing compares!So now that I've told you about afternoon tea, I can also tell you about breakfast.The eggs benny with salmon was so delicious, I almost ordered a seconds! The English muffin it was served on was totally noteworthy. It remained fluffy even with all the hollandaise sauce smothered all over it. The hollandaise was so well flavored and balanced I've already recreated it at home! I very much loved the cappuccino with a touch of cocoa.I can't even tell you how many times I came here (I mean, I can if I look at my bank statement) and each time I left satisfied and happy. This place needs to be on the top of your list when visiting London. Let's just say I came here almost once everyday if not twice.",

I was really looking forward to the experience, but ended up being quite disappointed from their food. To start off our meal, we ordered lobster bisque, it was cooked with cognacs so it doesn't taste good at all. Maybe just not what I was expecting. I also got the large benedicts which came with two eggs and ham to share with my friends. The bread that came with it was pretty bad. Super hard to cut with our knives. We also had the pork belly, which tasted a bit weird and was really dry, I think it was cooked with pear or peach so more of a sweet taste to it. We ordered their rib eye steak (medium), but it was raw in the middle. My friends also got their earl gray tea and black/breakfast tea, both were unimpressed. The meal was pricey overall, about 32 pounds per person and really not worth that price. I'd recommend going somewhere else and avoid having your lunch here, service was extremely slow and you get charged 2 pounds per person for cover charge.Maybe you'll have better luck trying their afternoon tea.",

We wanted to get our bill and water and tried to call any passing waiters but they were either just too busy or ignoring us considering surrounding families were getting attention. One staff member apologized and got our bill to us quickly after that. There seems to be a big staff prescence but they couldn't help a table of two.",

If I had more control over my wardrobe (aka, not trying to pack a week's worth of clothes into a small carry-on), I would wear nicer clothes because this place is super cute. You won't be turned away, though! They even have a doorman who is SUPER nice! It would be easier if you make a reservation if possible, but can be on standby and still make your way in for high tea. I LOVED THE HIGH TEA. Boyfriend and I had this recommended to us by boyfriend's cousin, and we went all out on the full high tea: Tea, scones, desserts, finger sandwiches....love. It was so beautifully served and everything was delicious. The venue is lovely and beautiful and impressive. Service is nice as well. Everything is served beautifully, with lovely dishware to intricately made food. The scones are GREAT and the clotted cream...cmon America. You've been making terrible decisions lately (I mean, we just found out Trump is president...are you kidding me), but we can make 1 step of progress by bringing around scones and clotted cream. This was one of my favorite experiences in London. Do yourself a favor and check it out. It's a little pricey IMO (about $35 each when I went, which I understand changes with the exchange rates, etc), but 100% worth it!",

We didn't get a chance to go to the bar but also looks great.The food was incredible but very easy to get large and rich portions. I had the quail eggs (wow, just wow) followed by schnitzel with creamed spinach on the side. Delicious but filling! Luckily I also had enough space for the chocolate eclair.One of their meals or drinks (I can't remember) was also called the Lucian after Lucian Freud, who used to dine there, which was cute. Especially for my girlfriend who had read his book.Make sure you get a booking in advanced as it's almost always packed. We had a late dinner (9:45) and was still very lively.",

    "text": "I was waiting for a friend by the Green Park tube station and stumbled onto this place in the shadow of The Ritz and decided to have a peek inside. Beautiful space. High ceilings. Smartly dressed folks.I thought i'd try my luck at getting a table, though it looked full. There was a 45 minute wait without a reservation, so I put my name down. I was already about 30 minutes early to meet my friend, as i thought it would take a while to find a suitable restaurant for lunch on Sunday; she didn't mind waiting another 15 minutes, either.We ended up being seated right next to the entrance to the restaurant -- in the entryway itself. My friend told me that if she was on a date with me, i would have lost points with her. I think that getting reservations is probably a good idea, which makes this place kind of a gamble for the impulse diner... especially if you're entertaining a guest. Considering that I was dressed like a Levi's store mannequin, i'm kind of surprised that they'd want to seat me in such a visible location. i'd say it would be bad for business but the bill ran pretty high... so i think they did OK.We were about 45 minutes early for the afternoon tea menu, but managed to snag some incredible steak tartare and some of the most delicious shrimp that i've ever eaten in my life. I've been searching for a shrimp that compares since my visit here a couple months ago to no avail. I'm from a city on the Pacific coast, and we know our crustaceans -- The Wolseley knows them better.A great dining experience, with some good wine and interesting conversation. I'll be back for afternoon tea.",

We walked by The Wolseley on our way back to the hotel and decided to stop in. We were dressed pretty crappy (like typical tourists, hey, at least we were warm) and asked if they had a table for 4. They said we would have to be out by 6:30, which was almost 2 hours, plenty of time!We did the 19 pound/person afternoon tea, which came with a pot of tea for each of us, scones with clotted cream & strawberry jam (that was my favorite part), tea sandwiches (cucumber, roast beef, egg, cheese, salmon), and assorted pastries (my favorite was the battenburg cake).The atmosphere at The Wolseley is awesome, it used to be an old car showroom, then a bank, and now a restaurant. The interior is black and white kind of art deco style, but not. Very hard to explain, but very classy looking.We came back to The Wolseley for dinner a few days later and like before, the staff was very friendly, but the dinner food just wasn't as good as afternoon tea. I would highly recommend afternoon tea, dinner, not so much.I love The Wolseley, the staff is SUPER friendly even if you are dressed crappy, they will happily seat you.

We came with a large group and the staff could not have been more accommodating. Our first meal was a late lunch and was great. Classic English fare, with modern touches as well. The Welsh Rarebit was delicious as were all our dishes. Breakfast the next day was even better. The classic English breakfast was just the right portion and the black pudding and bacon were especially good. Great service, terrific food and they even had the bag of guide books put aside that we had forgotten there the first day we ate there. The main room can get a bit loud but they have a quieter side parlor or two upper balconies as well. A lucky find.",

Especially when you get up on Saturday before 10 o'clock.I recommend to make a reservation ahead, as Wolseley is well liked by many early Saturday morning shoppers.We ordered porridge, boiled eggs and of course a proper English Breakfast. The table is nicely equipped an sugar, marmalade, honey come in little pots.I recommend the earl grey tea as breakfast tea with milk.The place is very light - and if you are able to get a table on the inside balcony you can overview the whole restaurant or simply read the Financial times week end edition. Not only have you already read up on the weekend news but also are ready when Bond street slowly wakes up.",

The service is impeccable. \u00a0We were sitting upstairs on the balcony. \u00a0They pointed out a little buzzer that we could ring for service at any time so that we wouldn't feel neglected, but that never happened as the waiters constantly came up and down the stairs to refill our pots, check our cream and take away empty plates. \u00a0The manager came twice to make sure we were doing okay.3. \u00a0The quality of the tea service is incredible. \u00a0They offered six different types of sandwiches, perfectly baked warm scones and an assortment of small desserts. \u00a0We polished them off as though we hadn't eaten in a week. 4. For all this you would think that the price should be outrageous, but it's not. \u00a0Afternoon tea will set you back \u00a320 per person, but it's more than worth it for several hours of delightful chat and more than a full meal of food and goodies. In all my other reviews for afternoon tea spots, I've ended with \"in a city known for its tea, you can do better.\" \u00a0Doing better is going to the Wolseley. \u00a0*Note: you MUST make a reservation, and likely more than a week in advance. \u00a0They fill up very quickly and it's next to impossible to walk in for tea.",

If I could choose an afternoon tea place again I totally would somewhere more unique that doesn't serve 1) basic sandwiches and pastries and 2) diluted tasting tea.The best food was the scones, hands down. Sadly we were full and asked the server if we could pack some jam and cream to go with our to go pastries, but this place is apparently too bougie to do so. Lame. Waiters were also running around, not very attentive. I guess my expectations were too high (have I been spoiled by good food and service? But this is a $$$ place with high reviews). Looking around and people who were eating dinner, their food seemed better than the afternoon tea menu.",

The fondant hot chocolate is amazing. Hot but not too hot. Delicious dark chocolate that's not overly sweet. The fishcakes with poached egg was very nice. The fishcakes itself was excellent. It gets lost a bit in the hollandaise and poached egg but still very good. I would recommend the small portion as that was more than sufficient.",

Everyone that works here wants you to have the best experience too, and it shows.We came in right before the holiday and were seated immediately! Talk about good timing. The place was absolutely FILLED.The Afternoon Tea special is about 25 pounds. It comes with delicious little tea sandwiches, bakery pastries, and of course, warm scones! The tea kettle dishes out 3 solid cups of tea, and by the end of it, I still wanted more!My boyfriend also ate the lobster bisque and was shoving it into his mouth like all the lobsters were going to die out tomorrow, which tells me he thoroughly enjoyed it!",

    "text": "I thought this place is a pretty touristy destination, however, when I came for breakfast/brunch, it was a surprise that there were many locals! Mostly business people. I guess tourists come here for afternoon tea? :PThe building structure and ambience is amazing, really has the old European feel. We ordered tea & coffee (the latte was also surprisingly good! Huge pot of tea, always a plus), eggs benedict, breakfast basket, fish cake, pancakes and french toasts. The portion was pretty huge, and I think it is nice that there are options to order a cheaper and smaller version (1 egg benedict instead of 2). I share the breakfast basket with a friend, and ended up couldn't finish my full portion eggs benedict (and skip lunch the same day). The fish cake had a very strong fish smell, so it wasn't my favorite even though it was recommended by a friend. All the food are decent and delicious, but the one with wow factor is the pancakes! They are thick and fluffy! I like the breakfast basket as well, all the pastries are small but with good variety.Perhaps they still have tourists problem, so our waiter informed us that they cannot help us take a picture, but we can take a group selfie ourselves? :P I did make a reservation beforehand--they have limited seating available for online reservation, but Wolseley is very responsive via email reservation as well! (Take into account of time difference). We got a more preferable reservation time via email. However, since it was breakfast and apparently more locals, the table changing rate is pretty fast, I think for smaller group (2-3 people) you might not need a reservation. In reservation they also mentioned there's a time limit (1:30), but they didn't mentioned it or ask us to leave at all.",

Our brief for the club is that it needs to be opened from 7am weekdays, and needs to be easily accessible to our offices. The Wolseley is definitely not somewhere I could afford to eat dinner at, but breakfast is super affordable. It is typical old style London class, with tons of seating, and surprisingly at 7.30am it is packed out.The menu is standard breakfast menu, with lots of options. You can pretty much add any extras to your meal. I had mashed avocado on some seeded crusty pasty thing (sorry forget the name) and added 2 poached eggs. My friends had food envy when it came out. Definitely the pick of the table. My favourite part of the experience was the coffee. Most places for breakfast give you the smallest coffee cup in the world, and I always end up having 2-3, but here they give you and entire pot to yourself, and a huge cup. So I was in coffee heaven!!! All in all the experience was amazing, and I'd go back again in a heart beat.",

The steak arrived very small, nearly cold and was completely tasteless. The schnitzel had no flavour and there was very little meat on the two lobsters that were brought. It was very disappointing seeing as every item we ordered for the main course was over \u00a325, in addition to the multiple bottles of wine that were bought. One desert was brought with plastic wrapped around it. The service is sub-par and the staff have a very irritating habit of bringing odd numbers of dishes to the table and then taking ages to bring the rest of them. The restaurant itself is beautiful, with a very busy atmosphere- but it is not worth the money. We waited for 2 hours to have one course. A far better meal could be had at any number of much less expensive places.",

I was a little skeptical about coming here, thinking that by now this place would simply be a tourist trap, but it was the contrary and even exceeded my expectation. We were seated quickly even though it was busy, gained access to free wi-fi without a glitch, and had great service. I was undecided about getting a slice of cake or the afternoon tea special (consisting of finger sandwiches, 2 scones, some small desserts/tarts, and a choice of tea), but our server was very helpful and suggested to split an afternoon tea special and get an extra \u00a0pot of tea. The server even gave us some additional sandwiches. The highlights for us were the warm scones with raisins along with clotted cream and strawberry jam. It was literally heart-warming. The tarts (we got passion fruit/meringue tart, pistachio sponge cake, and passion fruit macaron) were delightful as well. The finger sandwiches were meh, but the sandwiches are part of the afternoon tea tradition. No complaints about the English Breakfast and Afternoon Blend teas; with some milk, the teas were simply \"lovely.\"Tourist or not, one cannot go wrong with the Wolseley.",

The four of us ended up staying for about 3 hours and no one said anything to rush us. Great service, good food. What you get for your money is probably not worth it, but afternoon tea is one of those things you can splurge on for the experience.For about \u00a322, it came with a pot of tea, finger sandwiches (egg, cucumber, smoked salmon, celery, and curry chicken), an assortment of cakes/pastries, and scones with clotted cream and jam. I remember a macaron in there somewhere. Everything looked fresh and carefully prepared. Presentation was exquisite. Although nothing was particularly unique, what they offered was well made.One last note... this is a classy establishment, but it's one of the few where you don't have to dress up. We came in jeans after a morning of wandering about, so it worked well for us. Other people around us were dressed nicely though, and this is by no means a casual place.",

    "text": "I walked in and was immediately taken with the beautiful interiors as well as the energy of the place. \u00a0The place reminds me of Balthazar in NYC with a little more posh to it so I had relatively high expectations. \u00a0It wasn't stuffy at all, as one might surmise from the entrance..and the eye roll from our cab driver when we told him where we were going. \u00a0 \u00a0We had the crayfish avocado salad..which was just okay. \u00a0The steak tartare was delicious, although my friend thought it was bland. \u00a0I may not be the authority on steak tartare because I'm not a fan of mustard or onions so I prefer mixing tartares myself. \u00a0However, the Wolseley's take was already mixed, but not a whole lot of dijon mustard to contend with. \u00a0Very good. \u00a0There was also the chicken liver and foie gras terrine, which was an enormous bloc served with the thickest brioche I've ever seen. \u00a0Not big on the thick brioche, but considering how much terrine they gave, it was nice to have enough bread to put it on. \u00a0We also had the oysters which were fantastic.The bulk of my meal is always the main course and my roasted pheasant was sadly, very dry and quite bland. \u00a0Another friend ordered the same thing and was sadly poking her poor little bird while we eyed our friend's plate of calf liver. \u00a0It was definitely the tastiest dish on the table, if not a little heavy and over-bearing as a main course.My coffee was lovely. \u00a0They took enough care to shape the froth prettily and serve it on a lovely tray served sugary syrup instead of sugar cubes. \u00a0A nice touch as I really needed the coffee to gear up for a loooong night at Movida.I really want to like the Wolseley more, but I feel like we just didn't quite order the best dishes. \u00a0However, it is a such a pretty place with impeccable service, I would come back to have the afternoon tea everyone's raving about in the reviews the next time I'm in London.",

    "text": "Great Breakfast in a proper British setting.I try to visit the The Wolseley whenever I visit London. \u00a0Yes, it's definitely a people watching spot, but I go for the coffee and the food. \u00a0This is London after all. \u00a0You can see famous people everywhere. \u00a0So don't bother them if you happen to see them at breakfast. \u00a0 They like to eat too. On my last trip, I flew in from the east and so was up early after my first night in town. \u00a0I arrived just as they were opening at 8:00, so I had the place mostly to myself and service wasn't an issue as it sometimes is. \u00a0There's a wide range of choices for breakfast. \u00a0Start with the pastry. \u00a0The Croissant aux Amandes is my favorite. \u00a0The Pain au Chocolat is good too. \u00a0If you have been getting your exercise in regularly and your cholesterol is under control, try the Baked Italian Egg Florentine. \u00a0Yum! \u00a0 The coffee is expertly prepared in the Continental way. \u00a0I guess they have just been practicing longer than us. \u00a0There are plenty of healthy choices on the menu too, if you are trying to be good. \u00a0I know they serve lunch and dinner later in the day, but I can't comment on those menus, everyone I know goes there for breakfast. \u00a0As I said the service can be a little off at times. \u00a0Some members of the staff, especially the non-English staff I might add, are a little haughty. \u00a0Don't let them get to you. \u00a0They are the ones working in the coffee shop serving you after all.Note to Americans: \u00a0You might think The Wolseley is a little imposing when you first visit with its proper British decor, the posh menu choices and the controlled chaos that goes on here at busy times, but give it a shot. \u00a0Most of the people are very nice and you just can't find a place like this anywhere in the states.",

The building and interior are beautiful, no doubt. The entire experience overall, however, doesn't quite live up to the hype. Some of the staff have a sense of entitlement and I got the \"oh you're American\" vibe. Some of the staff were amazing. The tea was neither amazing nor horrible. It was pleasant to drink. The food as well was pretty good overall. Would have liked to get a macaron on our tray but what can you do. We wanted to do an all out tea while in London and this was what it was. Great venue and decent fare but I'm sure there are just as good high tea options for a fraction of the cost.",

She was very uncommunicative and gave very condescending and snappy responses. She kept informing me I could not order the high tea before 3pm.

I then waited around 10 minutes for her to come back and take my order and she never did, so I ended up leaving because I got so fed up of waiting.

In addition, when you leave Ireland for England, you'll leave the razzers (Irish bacon - it's like ham and a really thin pork chop had a kid) behind, and find something much more like American bacon, also known as \"bacon.\" Over our ten days in Dublin and London, we saw a full gambit of interpretations of what is sold as \"traditional.\" The biggest range was in the black pudding dept., and The Wolsley wins that battle. Absolutely best blood sausage in the Isles! (Well, of the half a dozen that I tried).The Wolsley is also the only place I've ever seen watermelon juice offered, so of course, I had to order it. Yep. Watermelon juice. Tastes like watermelon.This place is fantastic, and absolutely the first place I'd recommend for breakfast in Piccadilly. It's like eating in the foyer of the Chicago Field Museum or some city hall or courthouse or something, with all the marble surfaces and the cold and austere but elegant design motif. Very formal service, five star presentation, and of course, great company made for an awesome dining experience.",

We split 2 full Afternoon Teas between 3 people, which was more than enough, given that the servers generously refilled our scones and sandwiches at no extra cost. When I asked if our leftover sandwiches could be packed for takeaway, the waiter gave us a new set of sandwiches. The food itself was tasty, especially the scones and the sandwich with tomato bread. The ambience was classy yet relaxed, so even as tourists in relatively casual clothing, we felt very comfortable. Overall, I would definitely recommend The Wolseley for afternoon tea despite the higher price point, as you will get your money's worth!",

We were mostly ignored by our waitress, but when she did show up, all of our (very ordinary) requests were treated with the utmost disdain. On more than one occasion, she walked away from our table and immediately began gossiping with the other waitstaff, laughing and looking in our direction. This type of bullying behaviour made for a totally unnerving and humiliating experience. When we finally expressed our displeasure, the manager was quite apologetic and had someone else take over. However, we then had to deal with the waitress continually walking past our table, muttering under her breath and glaring at us. Deplorable. It was a miserable meal.",

No one does brunch like California (except maybe NYC), though the Wolseley made an effort. The lavish, beautifully appointed dining room is a lovely experience, and the service is top notch.The food however, is quite underwhelming. We ordered the benedict (which several people on Yelp claim is the \"best benedict they've ever had\") - tasty, but really nothing special, with slightly chunky hollandaise sauce (and hollandaise sauce really ought to be perfectly velvety and creamy), the fish cake plate, which was more like a seafood cake with bits of shrimp and other unidentifiable mashed up sea creatures and smelled VERY fishy, and the 'crispy bacon roll,' which we imagined to be something like a flaky, dreamy pastry with bits of bacon in it, but turned out to be just a pile of American-style bacon and egg on a hamburger bun.Honestly, I had rather elevated expectations of this place since it's such a traditional London institution, and all the other reviews are so positive. However, once you get past the beautiful atmosphere, and compared to some of the more amazing brunch experiences available in other big cities, the Wolseley is really average at best.",

I go regularly for dinner with friends, but it is famous for its high tea, which comes with their own blend of tea, sandwiches, scones (jam and cream) and pastries. If you're visiting London, and want to experience what British culture is really about, head over to the Wolseley for high tea and sit back, relax and absorb the atmosphere of this wonderful place.Dinner is also a great place. Reservations are recommended, but if you don't have one, they reserve the Salon for non-reserved diners who can arrive and wait to be seated. While doing so you can get a superb drink from their exhaustive bar. I usually get a Vesper, one of my favourites. They make them perfectly, great balance of sprits and vermouth.I usually get the quail eggs and hollandaise followed by their signature Ribeye, which is to die for. I usually end up comatose afterwards. Try the treacle tart or apple strudel for dessert, served to perfection with abundance of flavour.N.B.: For anyone who doesn't eat unpasteurised dairy products, their cheeses are made from unpasteurised milk. But they do taste amazing!!",

Originally a prestigious car showroom commissioned by architect William Curtis Green turned now restaurant. They have breakfast, afternoon tea, lunch, and dinner. I've been here for dinner now a few times. Everyone in my party seems to order oysters and steak tartar and love it. I'm vegetarian and they have a special vegetarian menu that you can request with additional veggie options on it. If you want to find out your options in advance just e-mail the reservations department like I did as it changes. The bill here can add up but if you are coming here for dinner it's probably going to be a night out you don't do too often. The service is always excellent. Only con is that the seating downstairs can get quite loud and you feel too close to the next table sometimes. Tip: They have a few tables upstairs that are more private and uncrowded. They even come with a little button to call your waiter/waitress easily as you are sitting upstairs to make sure you have good service. They may not always be available but if you are offered one definitely sit upstairs!",

After a spontaneous little shopping spree around Piccadilly I decided to make the best of the early evening and treat myself to a dinner at The Wolseley. I was given a place immediately and got a table in the salon. A nice little room that is separated from the bigger dining room.I decided to order duck \u00e0 l'orange, the main of the day. I started my dinner with some nice bread and tasty butter. For drinks I got a glass of Gr\u00fcner Veltliner, an excellent Austrian white wine.My main was very good, a delicious succulent duck in a great orange sauce. Definitely a dish I would order again. After I had finished my duck, it was time for dessert, so I briefly looked at the menu and ordered the petit chocolate pot. And yes, it was kind of small, but it was very good with a strong chocolatey flavour.Throughout my entire stay, the waiters always topped up my water before I could even think about asking for more. I call this brilliant and attentive service. For me, The Wolseley lived up to its reputation, I had a very enjoyable dinner and there is no question that I will visit this place again.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch to celebrate 2 of my friends' birthday. It was probably cos I had too high expectations for the decor that I was less than impressed with the interior. Also, even though it's supposed to be a classy kind of restaurant there were people from all walks of life and it didn't feel too intimidating like The Delaunay. Brought a birthday cake to celebrate but the restaurant host told us that they only serve their own food. That was fine, so we requested for them to keep it. Somehow or another, one of the waitress brought it to the table where the birthday girl and boy were sat to confirm that the cake belonged to us. Well, that ruined the surprise we had kept for our friends and we were utterly annoyed with her lack of decency to keep things discreet. I ordered the soupe de poisson and salad nicoise - both were fish-based dishes. The soupe de poisson was exceptionally \"fishy\" and the salad nicoise had slightly too much tuna. Confit of Duck was good, but my friend didn't like the lentils (personal choice). Another friend loved her Loch Duart Salmon where she took a particular liking to the lobster cream sauce. Besides this, the Pot-Roasted Welsh Lamb and Grilled Rib Eye received no complaints. A slight annoyance was the missing steak knife when the steak was delivered. But the waiter delivered it promptly when asked. After that we ordered dessert where the vanilla millecrepe & banana split were satisfactory. We liked that our server was pleasant enough to interact and crack jokes with us. The highlight of the lunch was Wolseley's complimentary macaron/strawberry tart dessert to celebrate our friends' birthday. That took our friends by surprise because they did not expect anything after the blunder made earlier by the waitress. So even if we could not have our own cake, we managed to make the lunch special and memorable.tl;dr: we loved the food, ambience and our pleasant server but the ditzy waitress with the cake was the blip to an otherwise memorable birthday lunch.",

    "text": "I went to the Wolseley on Sunday for lunch with my fiance, another couple and their 1 year old baby. I had heard wonderful things and I must say that I was a little disappointed with the experience. The service was fabulous and the ambiance was really lovely although not as cosy as I had expected - a little cold and hectic. My main issue was with the food which was not up to par in my opinion. Way too basic for what you are paying for it. My friend ordered an omelette and she literally got just an omelette on her plate not even with a garnish of any sort. I ordered the tuna nicoise salad because I figured in a place like this they would serve a tuna steak with the salad, not canned tuna. But, they served it with canned tuna. I really wanted to love this place, but I'm not sure I would go back. I would rather spend my money on lunch or afternoon tea at Claridges or the Dorchester, if I'm looking for a special luxurious 'British' experience.",

Deliberated over the menu quite a bit and asked lots of questions, our waiter seemed to be new because he wasn't very knowledgeable about the food, although did say the lemon meringue was very good. We both settled for the burger and fries, which were very good. I went to the toilet and my friend was asked if she had decided on her pudding. We didnl;t think this was right, and from pudding onwards felt quite rushed, puddings were very quick, felt like they had come out of a microwave because of the speed but were very delicious, our coffee arrived and then we were told at 8.10 that our table was booked from 8.30 and we could finish drinks in the bar, we said ok, and our bill arrived less than a minute later. We felt that we were being watched and rushed, we eventually left at 8.25 leaving half a bottle of wine behind and half drunken coffees. Overall the food and atmosphere were good, and the staff polite - but we felt very undervalued - we had two courses, wine and coffee each so they made \u00a385 from us - we deserved a little better treatment, wouldn't rush back...5/10 or 2.5 stars out of 5",

    "text": "#537 To truly experience any country, you should avoid simply glancing over its sights and settling into a nice McDonald's restaurant for your meals. Instead, it takes focused and deliberate attempts to steer clear of the typical offerings a tourist would partake in to appreciate a country for its authentic character. So, for a guaranteed excellent experience with afternoon tea in London, the boyfriend and I decided to forgo the typical option of patronizing The Ritz and, instead, booked a 5:45PM reservation for 2 at The Wolseley. Reviews on Yelp assured us that we would not have to deal with unnecessary snootiness and their menu seemed just as (if not more) quality-controlled as The Ritz's. The establishment is not difficult to find and it's located on a high-profile street (Piccadilly) in the city. We were approximately 10 minutes early for our reservation, but the host so graciously welcomed us with a bright smile that we knew it didn't matter. He offered to coat check our belongings, but seeing our hesitation, he quickly suggested the coat rack several steps away from our table instead. What a gentleman. Our table was already ready for us and the host delicately adjusted the table so I could slide into my seat without any problems. He then pulled the chair out for my boyfriend. Seriously, the service was impressive. Our server gave us several minutes with the menu before popping over, but because we weren't ready, he quietly slipped away. I assumed I was simply going to go with their Afternoon Tea, however, their menu proved more extensive than the sample available online. In the end, I decided to go with the Champagne Tea instead, while the significant other went with the Wolseley Imperial. Once our orders were in, we were treated to a ringside view of an argument between the couple sitting to our left. We were perplexed as the woman angrily (and shrilly) berated her boyfriend, yet apologized profusely, at the same time. Her counterpart, however, sat there sipping on his tea and looking at the table. Suffice it to say, we breathed a breath of fresh air when they left. Our drinks arrived rather quickly and I was impressed with their silverware and teapot. The Wolseley Imperial literally came out on a silver platter with a piece of chocolate and miniature glass of water. I commend the bar staff's attention to detail! My green tea was perfect, with a crisp air to it and heavy caffeinated finish. Unfortunately, they brought it out boiling hot, which burned my subsequent cups. But, I found that the strong flavor contrasted the sweetness of my cakes well. Speaking of which, all of their food offerings were delicious. My order came out with five different servings of finger sandwiches (egg, chicken, celery, cucumber, and smoked salmon), but my favorites were undoubtedly the egg salad and the smoked salmon. If only we were allowed to put in requests! As for the cakes, I was satisfied. The boyfriend, however, enjoyed them much more than I did. The marzipan-coated multicolored slice of cake was a treat, while the macaron was a chewy, almond delight. Unfortunately, I found the rhubarb tart to be sickly sweet, so I pawned it off to Adam B. to devour within seconds. The real winners of my afternoon tea, however, were the two delicate and chewy scones that topped my tower. They came with thick clotted cream and strawberry jam, but I could easily have done without just to enjoy the full flavor of my fluffy scones. Once I finished off the food, I was stuffed. I had already sipped my way through 4 cups of tea and a food coma washed over me quickly. But, the saving grace was the champagne that our server promptly brought over once he realized we were done. The champagne woke me right up and we were off to dinner. Of course, we were happy to tip the compulsory 12.5%, but we would have tipped more if it weren't already added to the bill for us. I definitely recommend The Wolseley above all other places as I'm sure you won't receive any haughty behavior here. Wolseley, you'll always be my first!",

The service was great and all the staff were lovely. When we ordered the Afternoon Tea for two, they explained us right away the food in more details and what was available for refills.The finger sandwiches were nice ( salmon + cream cheese, chicken tarragon, cucumber, and I can't remember the two others, sorry!), and once we were finished the waiter asked us if we wanted refills (of course we did). We didn't have to wait too long before the second round arrived =).The scones were delicious, not too big, not too small and not too dense either. The jam and the cream were very good too.As for the mini cakes, my only disappointment was to not get 2 of each to share with my friend. We ended up cutting them in half so we could both try them all.Needless to say, we were (very) full after munching of all of it.",

I don't usually frequent posh places like this, so I tend to feel a bit out of place, but the service was excellent and they treated us like we belonged there.As we were leaving, the manager gave us macaroons to go as our drinks were supposed to be covered by my friend who booked the table for us(she didn't know that we don't drink), so they sent us home with goodies instead. We also walked out the door at the same time Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Burton did. So, it was a pretty cool experience over all. Brilliant service and delicious food.

It was so good that we went back for dinner tonight.The food was okay, expensive but tasty enough that it was almost worth the $$$. What really did bother me was the very poor service - not enough waiters to go around - and more importantly, the very strange 4 pound cover charge that appeared on our bill out of nowhere. \"It is for 2 people to be able to make a reservation so they could sit in the main dining room\" was the explanation. So I pay to eat food but I also pay to sit in the restaurant? Very strange. The waiter took it off, which was nice, but I doubt I'll be back when there are SO many better places to eat in London.Bottom Line: Go for tea and sit in the bar area, otherwise you'll be assessed a dining \u00a0room fee!",

Certainly make a reservation, though. It's quite busy otherwise. The afternoon tea selection was brilliant (their finger sandwiches were amazing -- an interesting arrangement of flavours on good-quality bread) and I especially liked the scones and strawberry jam! The assorted pastries are also quite nice -- while they're small and may seem insignificant, each bite still has an intricacy to its flavour.

Not wanting to shell out 70 pounds pp, I decided to book a table through opentable for me, my brother and my dad at 4pm. A little bit on the later side of afternoon tea, but boy am I glad I picked that time.After a semi-stressful Barclays bike ride around Hyde park (stressful because finding a place to return your bike almost deters me from the experience entirely) we walked over to the Wolseley. The doorman in a top hat graciously opens the door for you and your eyes set on a charming black and white interior filled with servers bustling around with tiers of scones and tea sandwiches in their hands.We were seated immediately and selected our tea options and desserts. The service was attentive and prompt, and the food delicious! We loved each sandwich, scone, pastry, jam, cream they had to offer - and the portion size was very generous!! This was meant to be an afternoon snack, but we left feeling very full.I hope you caught up on my foreshadowing earlier...but because we came relatively later, the dinner crowd was coming in while we were finishing up our tea and GUESS WHO pops in with his two daughters? Clive freakin' Owen. I'm pretty sure he is as close to British (movie) royalty I'll ever be seated 5 feet away from. Our humble family of 3 did not want to disturb him during his dinner so we inconspicuously pretended to take photos of each other only to focus on him in the background. Unfortunately, one of his daughters caught us in the act but Clive just turned around and flashed us a smile!Honestly, I would have given afternoon tea at the Wolseley 5 stars anyways but the fact it was teeechhhnically afternoon tea with Clive Owen...I would have given 10 stars if I could!",

But at \u00a314 I'd expect a certain quality. Luckily they followed through. I had just arrived in London after an 8 hour bus journey where I slept for half an hour, and as soon as I stepped off the bus at Victoria (well, as soon as I picked up a triple shot drink from Starbucks to wake me up), I checked Yelp to get some good suggestions of nearby breakfast. After a one stop tube journey, I walked past The Ritz and into The Wolseley. I did feel slightly underdressed, but the staff in no way made me feel this way. They were incredibly lovely and welcoming, and I was shown to my seat right away. The eggs Benedict came out around 10 minutes after I ordered them, and they were incredible. Definitely the best I've had. The staff were so lovely and kept asking if I was okay, and my entire visit was lovely. I'd definitely return here, maybe not for dinner if breakfast is \u00a314, but definitely for breakfast again. If you're looking for somewhere to go for breakfast/lunch/dinner in London, I'd definitely recommend here. Go!",

    "text": "Many years back, I read an article in Metro about best restaurant in London. The Wolseley was awarded for Best restaurant for breakfast! This is how I come across knowing this restaurant. It was a last minute plan on a Sunday evening that we decided to go for afternoon tea. I called to reserved a table but it was fully book for the day. The waitress advised me to walk in and wait for table. We went there with my baby and buggy. As soon as we walk in we were impressed by the ambient of the restaurant then follow by the friendly staff welcome. Staffs were very helpful, they were trying their best to seated us with a table that have space for us to park our buggy beside. I was desperate to get a \u00a0table, I told them is ok I can leave the buggy and carry my baby or put her in baby chair. Then the waitress check on my baby and said \"she is sleeping I do not want to wake her up. Let me try\" I was impressed. So we waited for a while and we got a table at the left side corner table of the restaurant. It also less noisy compared to the inside middle part of the restaurant.I ordered a set of afternoon tea with a pot of their house blend tea. My husband not a dessert person so he ordered a rib eye steak from the dinner menu. As usual I started my afternoon tea from the bottom, what I remember there were the usual cucumber sandwich, smoke salmon sandwich, egg sandwich with cress and ...... Then 3 pieces of cakes at second trey and 2 scones at the top trey. Overall I grade their afternoon tea is for sure better than Fortnum and Mason(from the cafe) but below Dorchester and Ritz. Average but very happy! Lovely time there!!The steak was perfectly cook for my husband as he wanted medium well. Juicy and tender. I would recommend this. Overall I rated 5 stars because I was very happy with their service and food. I will for sure come back for their breakfast but I have to remember to make it there before 11:30am!",

I did some yelping in the area and found this place, I didn't realize how fancy it was until I arrived there, I knew my meal was going to going to cost me a bit but hey, I was on vacation. When I walked in I was immediately greeted even though they looked busy. I had to wait a few minutes for a table and while I was doing that I was looking around, the environment really makes you feel like you're in a high end fancy restaurant which I'm not really used to. I was started off by a nice waitress but then I had different waiter that was very short and would only say 2 words to me. The food was excellent, I got pancakes with a side of bacon and I gotta say I haven't had great breakfast in a while so this definitely topped it off. Great place to have breakfast if you're in the area or a tourist if you're willing to spend some money! Only small complaint would be that the servers could be more involved with their tables.",

They said we had an hour and half for lunch before they need the table. \u00a0Being vegetarian, I looked at their vegetarian menu- I ordered the chilled heritage tomato soup as a starter and the spiced puy lentil and chickpea cake for the main course.

I thoroughly enjoyed it and if I do get an opportunity may just go to the Wolseley to try their Puy and chickpea lentil cake.My friend ordered a desert - one of their specials-I tried it but the Puy lentil was still my favorite. Overall was well worth the trip especially for my friend who had heard so much about the place.Service : Excellent, warm and helpful staffAmbience: lovely ( very British- old feel), high ceilings, chandeliers, Large room, comfortable dining space Food: above average to very goodMust Try (Vegetarian): Spiced Puy lentil and chickpea cakeRecommendation: Definitely worth trying for the experience",

No amount of good food makes up for the poor treatment.They are famous for their breakfast. \u00a0We had reservations for 10:45am and were seated promptly and offered coffees while we waited for our companions to arrive. \u00a0The rest was downhill. Our waitress pretty much disappeared. \u00a0We flagged someone down to order a bottle of champagne - it took 10 mins for it to arrive. It was much too warm and the cork exploded out, with a considerable amount of fizz spilled on the table. \u00a0The waiter sloppily poured our glasses, and came back to only halfway wipe up the mess that he made.After 20 mins our waitress finally reappeared to tell us we needed to order in the next 2 minutes as they were going to stop serving breakfast. Seriously? Maybe if she has come by the table sooner this wouldn't have been an issue.I wanted pancakes with fruit but no blueberries. \u00a0From the other tables it looked like it was a mix of strawberries and blueberries, but she claimed they only had blueberries and no other options. \u00a0They were advertising \"apple and blackberry compote\" as an addition to yogurt, so after a confusing exchange she finally relented to letting me order that as a side dish to the plain pancakes.The food did not all come out together. \u00a0Eggs came without toast, pancakes with no compote. When we inquired about the compote and my friend's croissant, someone returned to tell us there were no more croissants. (Why did they wait until all the food was on the table to tell us this? It was the only thing she had ordered!) \u00a0The \"compote\" turned out to be an ice cold dish of cheap applesauce with some blackberries thrown on top. \u00a0I suspect this was improvised and either the waitress didn't place the order properly or they had run out.Throughout this experience we had to constantly try and flag someone down for everything - syrup for the pancakes, butter for the toast, the bill, the credit card machine to pay, etc. \u00a0This was supposed to be a special occasion and at best, we were treated like an inconvenience. I won't go back.",

We arrived a few minutes prior and were seated by a host that greeted us, who then dug into his computer - without saying another word to us. We awkwardly stood there before he decided that it was okay to seat - or look - at us. Their baked goods are made in-house, from croissants to brioche, it's done here. They are set in tables in the middle of the rooms - to showcase them. In a place that charges for butter, then it better have something to look at, right? Oh, you read that right: they charge for BUTTER when you order TOAST (which does not come with any meal, and is a cost by itself.) And the marmalade/curd/chocolate spread for the toast (or baguette, in our case) was an ADDITIONAL charge. I was surprised that they didn't charge me for the napkin. For the record, I wouldn't say that I throw money around but when it comes to food.... but I'll admit that's where I spend my money. This, was a waste of money. My husband ordered coffee with milk, and I ordered an Americano. The Americano came out in a pot, which was unfortunate because the coffee was bitter (?) so I had a lot of bitter coffee. We looked through the menu, him choosing the gruyere omelet (zero accoutrements like bread, fruit, or starch) while I chose the Florentine (spinach) eggs benedict for myself (again, no accoutrements.) They have two sizes, one regular and one large, \uffe112.50 and \uffe120.00 respectively. Dang, I thought. That must be one helluva benedict. I ordered the large one, not really sure knowing what it meant.I'll save you the suspense and tell you what a large benedict here is: It's whole untoasted room temperature English muffins (not cut in halves) with the poached egg, spinach, and hollandaise sauce on top -- making it way too bready on each bite. The hollandaise was good, as was the egg and spinach.The service was robotic and charmless. Not formal/informal/rude/polite -- literally robotic in manner and voice.I'm bummed that this was my last meal before leaving London. As I told my husband: I chose poorly :( 55 GBP I'll never get back..",

    "text": "The Wolseley sits atop the list of timeless London restaurants. Located in the heart of Piccadilly, this European caf\u00e9 is known not only for its classic menu, but also for its lavish Venetian decor. Here, you can order pretty much everything from a simple bowl of yoghurt to an unnecessarily extravagant caviar omelette. Because you pay a premium for the ambiance and dining experience, food runs quite pricey. Reservations are recommended, even though they're open for basically the entire day. Just goes to show how popular this place is.// Eggs Benedict (\u00a39.25 small / \u00a318 large) - 4 starsIf someone asked me what a quintessential eggs benny looked like, I would use a picture of this dish. You have your perfectly poached egg, creamy Hollandaise sauce, fresh ham slices, and toasted English muffin.// Bavette Steak (\u00a319.50) - 4 starsOur waiter mentioned that this steak is only served with medium doneness. Although the flap is generally a pretty tough cut, I thought they did a good job of preserving its tenderness. The b\u00e9arnaise sauce added a nice rich flavor as well. Served with a side of pommes frites and gem heart salad.",

My friends and I had made reservations months in advance to make sure we got to experience this place during our stay in London and we were not disappointed!This is one of the quintessential places to go for a classic tea service. The ambiance is elegant without feeling pretentious. The service we received was excellent and professional, our server took time to explain recommendations and made sure we were thoroughly enjoying everything. We had so much fun dressing up and sharing delicious tea, scones, tea sandwiches, and mini pastries. To top it all off we had champagne and a chocolate dessert.I only wish I could have tried their breakfast, lunch and dinner offerings!",

    "text": "My last meal in London at the Wolseley was an absolutely delightful experience. \u00a0One thing I wanted to try during my visit was a \"Full English Breakfast\" - and from my research, the Wolseley came highly regarded as a London breakfast institution.I woke up early just so I could make the trek to Picadilly and be there right when they opened. \u00a0I was seated immediately and was impressed by... well, everything. \u00a0The servers and hosts were all extremely polite and carried themselves professionally. \u00a0The interior of the restaurant was posh, elegant, and refined. \u00a0The atmosphere was casual, yet formal enough for both tourists and business people alike to enjoy their Friday breakfasts. \u00a0It just felt so... well, classically British, I suppose, haha.I ordered a green tea and the \"Wolseley Full English.\" \u00a0Again, service was impeccable. \u00a0The tea came out in a special silver serving platter with its own tea strainer. \u00a0Fancy! \u00a0The Full English breakfast came out soon after and I couldn't wait to tuck in.As an American, we hear tales of the legendary \"Full English breakfast\" - hearty, heavy meals meant to be enjoyed at a local greasy spoon after a late night out rather than in a fine dining establishment. \u00a0And maybe that's true. \u00a0But the Wolseley version blew me away. \u00a0I didn't think it was possible to really \"elevate\" eggs, bacon, and sausage - but they did. \u00a0The scrambled eggs were uber rich and creamy. \u00a0The portabello mushroom was perfectly grilled and absolutely juicy. \u00a0The sausage was meaty yet tender, with a nice subtle sweetness to it. \u00a0My favorite was the black pudding - I'd never had this before and was eager to try it, and I loved every bite. \u00a0It was rich, flavorful, and sweeter than I imagined it would be - but it worked perfectly. \u00a0I wish more (or really, any) breakfast establishments in the USA had black pudding on their menus, because I would order it every time!Despite the heaviness of the meal, the Wolseley version of the Full English somehow felt \"light.\" \u00a0I'm not saying it was a healthy meal - after all, it had bacon, sausage, and probably an ungodly amount of butter and cream in those delicious scrambled eggs. \u00a0But it's a credit to the Wolseley that I ate that whole dang plate and still felt pretty good about it after.OVERALL: 5/5. \u00a0I see why the Wolseley is so highly regarded. \u00a0Excellent atmosphere, service, and an amazing Full English breakfast. \u00a0I'm so glad that I had the chance to experience this during my trip to London, and the next time I come back I will definitely return again.",

We were sat on the small upstair area, which was cool that we had a good view of the whole restaurant from above. However, the services up there was bad. I had heard great things about their services, but we didn't have any of that. I had hoped that there would be some special Wolseley twist to afternoon tea since it is so famous, but nope, there is really none. Just plain old over-priced finger sandwiches, scores and desserts.

Service at the bar was great. About 5 mins passed and the hostess told us we will be seated soon and the tables were being cleared off. We thought okay great we will be seated early! \u00a0Almost half an hour later, other people are being seated and we are still waiting! Then the hostess comes over to tell us it will be about 5 mins because she's waiting for a table to pay and leave. Umm what??? You told us a very long time ago that the table was being cleared! How is it that you're now waiting for another table to get up??? We were pretty upset and I didn't even want to eat there anymore but we already waited for 45 mins. Soon after we complained we got seated...Our waiter greeted us and I asked him a question about the tea menu to clarify something and he mumbled and I thought maybe he didn't hear me so I repeated and his response was \"you just order whatever you want\" and shrugged with this annoyed reaction. I was so freaking mad. Having to wait so damn long, then to get a waiter with an attitude, completely ruined my first ever Afternoon Tea experience. Very disappointed with this place. Only good thing is that I saw Russell Brand and he said hello.",

Fast forward nearly a 100 years and it still feels so very decadent, albeit now for speedy lunches rather than speedy motors. But posh cakes, posh cars, same same aren't they? Their afternoon tea service team may as well have been a motor sport pit crew, fast acting with well timed finesse. Their afternoon tea is truly an art form. Every attendant cool as a cucumber sandwich, the team highly choreographed like a Bob Fosse flick on the stage of this impressive \u00a0set with high ceilings, slick marble; once housing a bank, now a dining hall and this really does feel proper fancy.I usually could care less for afternoon tea; cucumber sammiches, macaroons and such likes are not really my thing, but this was really special. You can also bank on the effort that's in the exquisite delicate flavours. I loved the chicken and tarragon finger sandwich which was rather lovely and the scones, oh my, light light light, all the better to butter them over with heart clottingly cloying fresh cream and strawberry jam. After gallons of tea, as they kept topping our pots up with hot water, I finished this date with a Pimms sorbet, decadently topped with prosecco, not much mind, but enough to transport me with a sugar and caffeine high, out on to the pavements of Piccadilly feeling like a right lady muck.",

    "text": "Our first Afternoon Tea experience. Considering none of us have tried Afternoon Tea (\"High Tea\") before, it was a must-do while we were in London. The Wolseley seemed like a decent choice with good reviews and it was not too pricey. Making a reservation on their website was quick and simple, too.The Wolseley is a fancy restaurant and it looks nice inside. It would have been fun to sit at a table in the little dining area upstairs, where you can view the whole restaurant from above. I would have requested that had I known about it at the time of booking our reservation. We were not able to find out whether there was a dress code as well, so we went for smart casual just in case and it was fine. (I was surprised to see a couple men in jeans and Converse sneakers.)It was a busy Wednesday night and it was quite noisy, surprisingly. We had 'afternoon' tea at 5:30 PM because that was the earliest reservation available (we were a bit last-minute in making our reservation). The service was all right, but it seemed like the servers kept changing on us which, I thought, shouldn't have been the case being a classy restaurant and all. For our teas, we chose The Wolseley Afternoon Blend, English Breakfast, and Assam. I liked all the teas, but my friend thought the Assam (a black tea) was not as strong as she expected.When the food came, we all thought...that's it? (It was our first Afternoon Tea experience after all.) But the food was surprisingly filling.The best part was the fruit scones. They were so fresh and so good with the clotted cream and the strawberry jam. It was delicious! Out of the five sandwiches (smoked salmon, chicken, cucumber, celery, and egg), the smoked salmon was my favourite. The chicken was decent, too.Unfortunately, the desserts were disappointing... Out of the seven different kinds of pastries, only the chocolate \u00e9clair, the fig tart, and the cheesecake were all right. I was expecting the desserts to be good, if not, really good...By the end of our meal, we had a little bit of everything left so we got it all packed to-go. The server showed up with a bigger box than expected, and he told us he slipped a few more scones and pastries inside. That was quite nice of him, since we loved the scones!All things considered, I don't think I will be coming back to The Wolseley for Afternoon Tea, but I do want to give their breakfast or brunch menu a try. As for Afternoon Tea, I definitely want to see what The Ritz and Fortnum & Mason have to offer in comparison to The Wolseley. Sadly, that will have to wait until the next time I visit London!",

Recommend to book the reservation to avoid waiting with hunger.",

We waited about 15 minutes and they gave us a table near the bar. \u00a0The restaurant was beautiful and the hostesses were exceptionally courteous and proper. \u00a0 We came because we wanted to experience the \"afternoon tea\". \u00a0We were originally planning on having afternoon tea for 2 but the waiter had suggested that if we weren't very hungry that we can just order tea for 1 and share. This was a great suggestion and that's what we did. It was a good thing because the actual pastries/sandwiches was extremely underwhelming. \u00a0the Sandwiches were \"wonderbread\" typed bread with a slice of something in between and the crust cut off. So one was a slice fo salmon, one was a slice of cucumber and can't remember the other. The salmon and cucumber slices in between the bread was cut paper thin so you only get a very subtle taste. \u00a0then there was 2 pastries, can't remember what they were. and 2 scones. The scones were pretty good but i think what made it spectacular was the clotted cream they gave you to shmear. The tea we had was the \"wolsley blend\" which was quite floral and tasted better than my expectation. The tea pot also was quite unique....it was big and reminded me of genie's magic lantern. \u00a0In all, it was a good experience and we had a good time. it came out to $42 so we were glad we only ordered for 1.",

    "text": "Hands down my favorite place to dine whilst in London. Our previous visit in 2016 we dined with my sister & her family. They're members so we got a choice seat & there was plenty to look at (ahem, Joan Collins at 12 O'clock). My memory is a bit vague on what I had but I did LOVE the endive salad. This time around & since it was a short distance to our hotel we opted for breakfast with my niece & her fianc\u00e9. This place is super busy during breakfast as it is a very popular place for breakfast meetings. I suggest making reservations. We were seated promptly & again loved the table. I started with Earl Grey & H decided to go with The Wolseley Imperial which just about had everything in it: mandarin napoleon and cognac, long espresso, hot milk topped with chocolate and whipped cream served in a schmancy glass. I admit it was very tasty! For food, I ordered the large Eggs Benedict (you can order just 1 which is the small) because I knew H would want to have a bite or two since he ordered the jambon & gruyere omelette. The food was delivered piping hot & OMG the best benedict I've had (and I've lived a very long time). Two perfectly poached eggs sitting on slices of ham, topped with hollandaise. All this on top off a scrumptious muffin. The muffin was so soft, pillowy, & toasted just right. Hmmmm. I'd fly across the pond just for the benedict.As usual, the service was stellar even though the atmosphere was frenetic we felt like we were the only diners there. And huge shout out to the really kawaii girl at the next table that not only polished off the large portion of EB but also a serving of waffles with fresh berries. Have no idea where she put all that food.",

I was not, however, a huge fan of the service. It seemed that other tables were getting reasonable amounts of attention, but the waiter that took our order actually never came by our table.... ever again. No one offered us water, and no one came close enough that I could flag down (or would make eye contact with me) to check in at all after our dishes were served. I had to flag down a waiter walking by at the end JUST to get the check. I'm not sure if there was a weird handover since it was just after lunch hour, but with a place as nice and classy as this one, I would have expected significantly better service. It's unlikely that I would return again for lunch.",

    "text": "I was craving a good hot breakfast just about everyday I was in London because of how cold it was. Ricky found this place and made reservations for us on the last day we were in London. Located on Piccadilly... right next to the Ritz....this place is packed on weekend mornings, make sure you have a reservation. The architect William Green originally constructs this place in 1921 as a car showroom for the Wolseley Motors. After it was a Barclays bank, and then a Chinese restaurant \"The Orient at China House\". Lastly in 2003, it was reopened after restoration and renovation as an upscale restaurant by Chris Corbin and Jeremy King. When you visit you can see and feel the history. It is just remarkable and beautiful. I was personally of course quiet fond of the Asian pieces located throughout the Wolseley. This place since 2003 has won multiple awards and been one of the highest profitable restaurants in London. When we arrived it was December so the interior was decorated with Christmas decors which was a splendid sight. It brought a joyful ambiance to the place. When we arrived, we were seated immediately due to our reservation. Thank goodness because I was starving.Immediately after bring seated, we ordered as we reviewed the menu in the cab on the way over. Hubby and I both ordered French toast with berries with an order or smoked salmon and eggs to meet macro protein daily requirement (even on vacation lol). It was good. It is quiet hard to mess up breakfast food in our opinion lol. Oh and we ordered coffee and OJ of course. It was delicious breakfast. Breakfast here feels upscale, but fun/youthful/laid back which really is a lovely way to start the day. Not like the Ritz next door where it can feel kind of stiff and quiet (I do prefer that for afternoon tea though- relaxing and soothing time). And during the holidays the festivity bring a fun and romantic bounce in the air. I highly recommend paying a visit here.",

    "text": "I had such a great time at The Wolseley! This was my first time having high tea in London, and everything was top notch! Service was impeccable, food was good, but the tea selection could have been a bit better, as there was only one choice for non caffeinated tea. I absolutely loved the decor of the Wolseley, from the front entrance to the bathroom! It was such an experience, and I truly enjoyed myself. While researching places to experience high tea and trying to make reservations, we were unlucky because most restaurants charged upwards of \u00a360 per person and were oddly booked on a weekday. We got a recommendation here, called about 2 hours ahead and were able to be seated, and seriously we enjoyed ourselves! I've told others who visited London to come here as this is the premiere high tea experience.",

We came on a busy Sunday morning and to be honest my initial thoughts were a bit underwhelming. We walked in. Staff seemed busy and not particularly interested in our arrival. However, we were shown to our table quickly. Dining room was grand but had a feel of a busy brasserie, with quite a casual vibe.Service actually wasn't great, which is shame because I'd heard such good things. All our waiters seemed a little indifferent to us and not at all friendly.However the good - the food! My eggs arlington (their version of eggs royale) was brilliant with beautifully creamy hollandaise. We also shared some french toast which was really delicious. So ultimately the food was great. But it was quite pricey and service was poor which does let it down a bit as it undermines the whole experience.",

In London, English breakfast is a must.The Wolseley is a very popular and impressive spot to get a lovely English breakfast in the morning. It's highly recommended that you make a reservation here. We were able to get a table as a walk-in, but we came almost as soon as they opened on a Sunday. By the time we had finished our meal, the restaurant was packed and couples and families were crowded around the main entrance waiting for their tables. My BF and I both ordered the English and the Wolseley English breakfast tea. Our tea came out first. Since we ordered the same tea, we got a big teapot. The tea was full-bodied and rich. Although I typically do not like taking sugar or milk in my tea, English breakfast goes very nicely with these condiments. The English comes with your choice of fried, poached, or scrambled eggs with bacon, sausage, baked beans, tomato, black pudding, and mushroom. Everything was delicious! If I wasn't so full, I would have eaten a second plate. I only wish American breakfasts were served with proper baked beans, black pudding, tomatoes, and mushrooms. It really enhances the overall meal and creates layers of flavors. This is a pretty traditional English breakfast - no frills.One downside is that they charge for toast. Also, the service is very perfunctory and somewhat slow. It's not too unexpected given how busy this place gets to be, but it also makes the experience stiff. The price is also pretty steep for breakfast.",

You could just as easily have a business meeting as you could a first date here. The sandwiches, scones, & petit pastries that make up Afternoon Tea service was absolutely filling. Halfway through our meal, our waiter asked if we wanted any more sandwiches or scones; we balked at the thought of more food. A few of the sizable finger sandwiches contained heavy cream cheeses, & though the pastries were tiny, they packed a rich, decadent wallop (think: cheesecake, marzipan cake, chocolate cake, etc.) Hearty & a bit overwhelming at times for a meal that is supposed to be quite dainty. Would not return for afternoon tea, but would come back for breakfast. My decaf earl gray tea was fine, though I wish there was more of a decaf selection. \u00a337,50 per person. Outstanding service, sat us promptly for our reservation, & checked on us frequently.",

We hoped to walk-in for breakfast/brunch at 10AM on a Saturday and were in luck - they had a table for 3 people, though a bit after we were seated there was already a 30 minute wait. I ordered the English breakfast tea and the two eggs with toast soldiers. Everything was beautifully presented and tasted impeccable. My meal, made of the simplest ingredients, was such a delight! The sourdough toast was perfectly chewy and buttery. My companions' meals were also beautiful. The ambiance was grand and classy, and there seemed to be a nice balance of locals and tourists in the clientele. Though the experience was a bit pricey, I thought it was worth it, especially as a treat for our last meal in London.",

To say that it was a disappointment was an understatement. The avocado had simply been sliced and dumped on the plate, along with a grilled tomato and two giant mushrooms. No seasoning whatsoever. My dining companions' pancakes and fruit yoghurts didn't look that much more impressive. And in an extremely competitive brunch market (I could have opted for nearly any little establishment in Dalston or piled-high waffles and pancakes at favourites such as Granger & Co., for example), this experience simply didn't measure up.

Everyone around us was dressed in suits of the banker's variety. Everyone was conducting business (we even saw a secretary taking notes!). And that meant that the waitstaff knew that people were not paying attention to them, allowing them to take shortcuts and make mistakes. Our orders were taken quickly and we were served with equal speed, but we were forgotten after that. Whenever we did want something (sugar for the coffee, or jam, for instance), we had to tell the waiter twice in each instance to get the desired item.

The portion is pretty generous for the price, location, and the style of the restaurant, so generous I couldn't finish my order! But a pleasant surprise was that they just gave us extra scones and instead of just putting in our leftover jam and cream into a container, they just gave us the nicest containers that were filled up with new jam and cream.

When Yee Gan asked what I most wanted to do in London, I said, with no shame, that I wanted traditional English afternoon tea. I am sure somewhere in his head he groaned a bit ... but hey, when in England ... you must!Luckily we got in without any reservations (although the place is very busy usually) and got into one of the last seatings for afternoon tea around 5pm. They have many different sets to order from, and we ended up just ordering one set between the two of us because we had dinner plans later on. The tea was served in a very nice silver tea pot and our dessert / food / sandwich tray came out quickly after. I love all the gadgets they use to serve tea and all these cool things you rarely see in the US because we are not a tea culture there.The treats were delicious although I think my favorite was the little green tea mousse thing! Highly, highly recommended, I had a wonderful time. Thanks Yee Gan O.!",

I remember being crushed because I really wanted to check off this quintessential English restaurant from my short three-day stay in London. Wasn't meant to be I thought.On our second day, we went to Buckingham Palace and decided to cross Green Park to make it to Piccadilly Circus. I had forgotten that we would pass the Wolseley! And I'm glad we did. Without a reservation and in need of something to eat, we were greeted by a nice doorman. We got a table for lunch. Not in the main \"eating area\" but in a side room. I ordered the classic Egg Benedict (the small portion), which is basically a fancy version of an Egg McMuffin from McDonald's. That is not meant to be a stab. It was amazing and went well with my cappuccino. My mother ordered a steak that came with a salad and frites. She said it was her favorite meal in London.P. S. The bathroom is impressive. It's underground and below the enormous clock.",

So I ended up making the reservation online. My friend and I wanted a true English breakfast for our last day in London. I have found this place on yelp before I got to London. We had breakfast on a Sunday, right when It opened the place was packed. Everything on the menu looked really good. I ordered the English breakfast.. Since I am a vegetarian, I told them to give me more mushrooms beans and eggs and take out the meat. I've fell in love with baked beans ever since I \u00a0landed, and their baked beans were really good. I also love how fluffy the eggs were! The rest was just whatever's. Maybe I was just not really in to veggies in the morning.Go try this spot out when you get a chance, they are kind of pricey though.And don't forget to make a reservation, it's usually packed.",

Sadly, the service was a little spotty, we kept having to flag people down and were never asked if we wanted any coffees or anything after our main plates were cleared. Food was all good but to be perfectly honest, not spectacular as I've immediately thought of a few better versions of what I had ordered that I wished I was eating. It's actually a good value for money unless you go for something like the caviar omelette. I think there's a time and a place for the Wolseley, and it's something you should do if you're in the market for treating yourself but don't let the fact that you haven't been keep you up at night.",

Although their dining room was booked up, they seated me in one of their two parlor rooms, which was very lovely and suited me just fine.

We didn't enjoy the Eggs Arlington as much as the Eggs Benedict as the salmon made it a bit too salty for our taste. The omelet with jambon (ham) is nice and solid on the outside but very soft inside. The decor is very unique and the people at Wolseley were also very nice.

    "text": "Once again, thanks to my visiting Yelp Elite friend Lorrie M from San Jose who gave me an excuse to treat myself to the 'tourist in your own town' experience \u00a0when she visited London last weekendOne of the must do experiences on her list was to have afternoon tea. To be honest, it's a ritual that I had never considered - my Chinese Thrift Gene won't let me pay \u00a342 for tea at the Ritz when that could get me a great proper meal elsewhere, However, when in Rome with a tourist........... heheLorrie had a scary amount packed into her 3 day visit and her small time window for tea on Sunday afternoon actually made it easier to organise by cutting down the optionsThe Wolseley has a colourful history, having been a car showroom and a bank but since opening its doors in 2003, it has attempted to retain an air of a grand European dining room and you will see diners dressed up in their finery to partake of grand British classic dishes, which makes it an ideal to enjoy a quitessential traditional English afternoon teaDespite its air of grandeur, it's nice that you can dine in here in casual clothes without feeling out of place, while being able to enjoy the cultured ambiance, They also serve afternon tea til 6.30, which is later than most placesWe were seated without much delay despite not having a reservation. As we were due to have dinner in the near future, we shared one afternon tea between us, which turned out to be plenty, especially as we were offered a free refill on our sandwiches.I think Lorrie enjoyed the tradition of the 3 tiered tray with sandwiches (crusts cut off of course) on the bottom, cakes on the middle tier and home made scones on the top, served with clotted cream and strawberry jam. The tea was also served in a nice traditional teapotEverything tasted lovely in an afternoon tea sort of way. The egg salad sandwich was my favourite sandwich but our favourite item was the fluffy scone - I showed Lorrie how to split the warm scone and slather it with clotted cream and jam. It's yumminess which makes you want to break out in a verse of Land of Hope and Glory!For visitors to town, the Wolseley provides a chance to experience a tradiional afternon tea in a splendid surroundings without breaking the bank",

Their comeback to the capital probably post the end of a non compete period is another story. The Wolseley on the other hand is probably closer in execution and positioning to another of their great success stories , The Ivy. The common theme here is that the food at both is no great shakes in fact for me the food at The Wolseley just does not cut it. Hand on heart I cannot recommend anything on the menu and say it is good or even average be it the Salade Nicoise, Steak Tartare, Salt Beef, Hamburger, Weiner Schnitzel, Steak Frites or any of the deserts with the possible exception of the Banana Split. If the food is not the basis of your decision-making when selecting a restaurant in this price bracket then you may find that you can have a pleasant evening in another David Collins Architects restoration.",

(damn yankee!)my friend and i came here for afternoon tea on the suggestion of (and in the company of) her friend who frequents the wolseley for the same. a wonderful space that isn't stuffy but harkens to a bygone era of sleek style and class. incredibly friendly service, too! the clotted cream was so yummy as was the strawberry jam, and the scones weren't dry at all. and, of course, my earl grey was oh so yummy. as melanie k. said, apparently you do see famous people there, but umm, i had no idea who they were. apparently we were in the company of someone who owned a soccer team [err, football club?] or two. great location -- get off at green park, head towards the ritz (the building with the flags sticking out) and go past it a block or two. easy-peasy.p.s. umm, they seem to not really have a strict dress code--i spied a guy in there in a sleeveless shirt (tho, to his credit, he was wearing chinos... O_o), which is kind of disappointing. i hate dressing up, but i say at least put a little effort into it! (guys, a nice button-down and jeans would be fine, imho)",

The service was exemplerary , the staff were professional but completely approachable, and we felt very much at home. We were suffering slightly from the excess of a night at Ronnie Scotts the previous evening, and so ordered up a hair of the dog in the shape of a couple of bloody marys \u00a0these definitely hit the spot and were a great accompaniment to our eggs benedict. Service works like clockwork, which you'd expect with the number of staff, but it's also the little touches in details, such as the silverware, and the way food and drinks are presented that make a visit here such a great experience. We loved it so much we returned the following day for brunch \u00a0and were not disappointed. We tried the croque madame and the fishcake with poached egg, and the fresh juice of the day \u00a0all were exceptionally flavoursome and well cooked. We're spoilt for anywhere else for breakfast now",

That may be the case for some shallow folk, but I've never had a bad meal there (but then again, I've never had to pay the bill, so I would say that!). I'm yet to eat there in the evenings, but the breakfast and afternoon tea has always been superb. The haggis with duck eggs was probably the most fantastic breakfast I've ever had the good fortune to eat, and the selection of croissants were gorgeous as well. With regards to the afternoon tea, I have no comparisons, but that doesn't mean I don't know what makes the elements good. The sandwiches were lovely, and the scones were pretty much perfect. The design and layout was great, be it on ground level or the balconies. Plus it's not even overly expensive! (Cost is obviously subjective for must people, but relatively speaking it's worth every penny)",

Its a fantastic period building, originally commissioned as a car showroom in the 1920's, and was then a bank and Chinese restaurant before being restored and refurbished to reopen as the Wolsey in 2003. Food here is as you might expect expensive but because the menu focuses on snacks rather than meals its very feasible to visit and enjoy light refreshments without too much damage to the bank balance. Also hot water refills for pots of tea are free (unlike Starbucks and Costa Coffee etc) so for tea addicts its probably quite good value! My friend had her last birthday get together here which was very good fun. Prebooking is recommended to ensure you get a table.",

Unless you're a regular, you won't get the best people-watching tables but the service is brisk and the menu is simple with something for everyone - like many other establishments founded a few years ago, they specialise in new British International cuisine, which is a euphemism for upmarket comfort food. I have always enjoyed the Wiener Schnitzel. They also do an afternoon tea in a more congenial, less lugubrious way than some of their colleagues in the neighbourhood (The Ritz, Dorchester, Browns, etc). Still, if high afternoon tea is what you want - and nothing else - I'd recommend the Dorchester or Claridges, because they are more glamorous without all the pretension (of the Ritz).",

I was tired and hungry, so I decided to Yelp! a place for dinner. This place came up, it looked good based on positive reviews. I walked in and asked for a table; the guy took my request and asked me to wait. I stepped off to the side and a couple of minutes later another guy approached me and started telling me that they had a really long wait. He told me that I would have to wait beyond half an hour, but despite that he couldn't guarantee me a table. Then, he started giving me some bullsh*t story about how they are reserving tables for people coming from another restaurant that had to close due to some bullsh*t problem they had today. I noticed a couple of things pretty quickly; 1. pretty much everyone in this place was White (except the one guy they sent to talk to me) 2. since I had been walking around London all day, I was dressed casually (jeans and tennis shoes) everyone else NOT.I got the hint, so I walked out. I still felt tired and hungry, but now I also felt discriminated against. My suggestion if you decide to go here is to call ahead, make a reservation, dress up and maybe, just maybe they will serve you... but, no guarantees!!",

Out of the three, I'd rate the Wolseley as my second favorite (or second least favorite is also possible...) after the Langham. The tea was good, the pastries were tasty and the scones were a great mix of flakey and buttery. I'm no scone expert -- but the scones at the Ritz seemed far too cakey while the scones at the Wolseley seemed like the perfect mix of flakey, dense and airy to be a great clotted cream and jam carrier. Another big upside was that the service was friendly, although it was some times a little hard to get a server's attention. Also, we arrived a little late and I was catching up with an old friend -- we had lots to talk about. Too much apparently, the Wolseley asked us to leave and free up the table, which I thought was a bit odd, though understandable.",

My place of work employed a chef from the Wolseley who would cook us the most spectacular lunches. The Wolseley is a lesser place without his cooking. Nevertheless, it's not the food that let this review down.The architecture (marble pillars, arches and stairways and \u00a0Venetian and Florentine detailing) is beautiful. The building was originally a Wolseley Motors showroom in the 1920s and has been maintained as such. I suggest dressing well to fit in. It wasn't the architecture or atmosphere that let this review down either. The drinks however, are what stopped me from giving them five stars. Nobody in this establishment (including the bar manager apparently) knew how to make a Cocktail Vodka Martini. My table agreed. Despite being as specific as possible regarding the details of my desired poison (extra dry, over ice, one cocktail olive) they still brought me vodka in a cup.Dinner is wonderful. The bar is dreadful (if you drink Vodka Martinis). I hear from others and the posts below that tea is great.",

    "text": "In my hours-long research sessions while planning the cuisine schedule of my trip to London (museums? shows? don't be silly) I came across one piece of advice that was too persistent to be ignored: you must go to breakfast at The Wolseley. Alright then, I'm not one to ignore advice from fellow Yelpers, let alone the entirety of London dining-out sites.So I came, hopes in hand, for a delicious gastronomic experience. I even skipped dessert the night before in preparation for my croissant basket. The decor is brilliant, as my mother commented, reminiscent of \u00a0Balthazar in NYC. The menu required some interpreting but eventually I settled on the bread basket (essential) and the gruyere omelet. Sigh. The basket came with plain croissants, pain au chocolate, and almond croissant, a rich chocolate cakey deal, and one other unidentifiable pastry. It was alright. The pain au chocolate was undeniably the winner.My omelet was...boring. I could have made it at home and it didn't come with any extras. No potatoes, no fruit, no bacon or fat-laden sausage. I was unimpressed.What I will say for The Wolseley is that it is a fantastic people-watching arena. Located in Mayfair, just east of the Ritz, there is an air of importance about its diners. Business being conducted. Socialites putting ketchup on their pancakes. Dirty youth who could only be assumed to be massively successful rock musicians that I cannot identify because I am not posh enough.If anything, go for the atmosphere. Or the poached eggs, which my co-diner thought were \"perrrfectly cooked.\"",

Ordered Darjeeling and at first I thought that I had not let it steep enough but after 5 minutes, I realized that there were simply not enough tea leaves in the pot to make anything other than pale, watery tea. \u00a0Coasting on its reputation? Who knows. But there are certainly \u00a0much better options in London than the Wolsey.",

Sometimes the old ways can show us how we should be today.The food there is gorgeous, and the setting, inside an old car showroom, is a grand place to eat. High ceilings, open spaces, and the fixtures and fittings all lend itself to a fantastic eating experience.It's always busy and getting a reservation is a must normally, however, they always keep some tables back for walkins so even if you haven't got a reservation, try your luck. But don't expect joy if you turn up with a party of 10...For me, the Eggs Benedict is a winner for me. They've been perfect every time I've had them.",

It was def. a bit high class in terms of the staff but was told attire is casual and can we wear anything. Would be a fun time to dress up though. The finger sandwiches, crumpets, and little desserts were pretty good. Crumpets were the best part. And the best best part was the AWESOME butter. Best and creamiest butter I've ever had hands down. Jam was good too. The tea was very good. We expected to be charged for the second pot but were not. We ordered one afternoon tea plate thing for two, since we had a late lunch. That was more than enough for a light snack for the both of us. There are probably better deals for afternoon tea at other places.

I ordered the eggs florentine and they were the best I've ever had. The bread wasn't so much an English muffin as it was more of a softer, doughier bread and it was phenomenal. The poached eggs were cooked to perfection- many I had in London were cooked too much. We also ordered the French toast with bacon and again another winner. I loved the table settings and how all the plates served have the name 'The Wolseley' on them. Coffee is served in these beautiful silver coffee pots that make you feel like royalty. As to service, it doesn't fall short. All the servers were attentive to us even though we were sitting away from where everyone was. Several came upstairs to see how we were and if we needed anything and were very quick to get us anything we needed. It definitely made my dining experience one of the best I had in London!

You see these items on breakfast menus every where, but The Wolseley presented them in a much more elegant way.

We arrived 30 minutes too late so we ended up having a quick lunch instead. The restaurant is beautiful with high ceiling and had a bit of European brasserie atmosphere. The dress code is casual but smart. Our encounters with staff members were great however our server was very aloof with all of his tables. I think he forgot to put in our order because someone else who was not our server came to us to apologize about the delay of our dishes. It wasn't even that long to be honest but he asked if we'd like a coffee or tea while we wait which we appreciated.Food was fine. I had a Gruyere omelet and hubs had the Eggs Benedict. Both dishes were simple and elegant. Reservations are highly recommended. We arrived without one and awkwardly waited for a table in the bar area for a good 20-30 minutes.",

The place was packed, buzzing, with a great atmosphere! The Brits clearly love their afternoon tea, because most of the tables by us were filled with Brits, not tourists. The waiter asked us which tea package we wanted to do, we selected the full Afternoon Tea, with scones, sandwiches and desserts! I opted for the Wolseley Afternoon Blend Tea, and I can't remember which one my hubs got, but basically they were both very good! We're not normally big tea drinkers, but I don't know, maybe it was being in London, or at the beautiful Wolseley, but either way, we drank and drank tea with milk! The presentation of everything was just lovely! The tower of the treats, in 3 levels, was adorable, and the giant teapots with all the herbs inside, and the little strainer, were just so cute! The scones were by far the best, warm, served with butter and jam, omg, I want some now!! There were four kinds of mini crust-less sandwiches, some better than others, but all tasty, and the BEST part, free refills of those sandwiches! The waiter asked us if we wanted more, and I mean, we didn't NEED more, but YOLO, so we got a second helping and ate them all! The mini desserts were so pretty they were tough to eat (jk, not that tough) and my fav was a mini strawberry tart. All in all, this is THE place to go for Afternoon Tea, you'll have a lovely time and will likely not need dinner that night! So plentiful and delicious!",

Both my mother and I were happy camper. From a tea perspective, their cakes and scones were very fresh and my mom enjoyed the experience very much. She thinks the tea is smooth and really loved the texture of the scones. My son had the fresh mint tea infusion and it was very refreshing. the creme burlee was also light and crispy.

My caramelized grapefruit was delicious. However, the bircher muesli was way too thick and had way too many raisins. Both people who ordered it didn't like it. Also the Eggs Arlington was a bit odd tasting because the smoked salmon was so cold it made the hollandaise sauce cold as well. Our server never checked back with us until we flagged him down for the bill. Too expensive for not so great food and bad service. Won't be returning.",

The display was set up really well. The waiter was courtesy and prompt. The Chips was a bit undercooked. I will give the another shot based on the large menu and the outstanding customer service.",

We were seated promptly and our waitress was great and friendly and explained the menu well. But from there our experience went down hill quickly. The waiter that dropped off our tea was gruff and didn't bother to explain except to cluck at you when you attempt to help him move things around the table so he could set the items down. Our waitress then disappeared off the face of the restaurant without even letting us know, so we couldn't even order more plates/tea even if we wanted to. All around us other waiters were checking in with the tables on either side of us to see if they wanted anything else but continued to ignore us. We had to flag down a waiter to grab our check and get our food boxed, our boxed food came, but our check didn't. Had to check with another waiter, still nothing. It took the third waiter to get us our check and he promptly threw it down on the table without even a comment. The food wasn't even good enough for it to be an excuse for them to be so pretentious when we were nothing but polite. I'd rather spend the extra \u00a320 or so and go back to Sketch than come back here again. Save your money and don't bother wasting it on bad attitudes.",

Not to say this spot isn't worth a visit, and I like the idea of it for an occasion or special night out, the Wolseley does fit the bill for atmosphere. On bustling Piccadilly, the sweeping dining space has the feel of old world style dinning room, but more New York then London.",

They once accommodated a friend's dietary requirement which we had forgotten to mention in advance.My favorite pastry was their raspberry and chocolate tart, really delicious. As afternoon tea can be a bit filling, they offer to take away the leftover pastries, sandwiches and scones in a box, which is great because then we get to enjoy their food for a bit longer.Overall, a very classic but quality afternoon tea, where anyone is welcome despite the fancy decor.

It's probably smarter to make reservations ahead of time because you'll have to wait in the small bar area.

    "text": "Vacations in London fall into two camps: shoestring or splurge. \u00a0The Wolseley is meant for the latter.I had lunch (steak frites) here several years ago and I finally had my chance to come back for another dining experience today. This time, it was afternoon tea. For \u00a319.50, you get tea of your choice, finger sandwiches, an assortment of delectable pastries, and scones with strawberry jam and CLOTTED CREAM! \u00a0I recommend adding either a glass of champagne or a champagne cocktail to round out your experience. I chose the French 75 (champagne and gin).Other reviewers have mentioned the rather grand space. If you eat here, spend some time to look at the chinoiserie detail. \u00a0The bathrooms (through the door to the rear of the dining room and down one flight of steps) are very nice too. \u00a0I love the solid fixtures here.Overall, the Wolseley is a great stop for a trip to London. Given the type of clientele, it could be slightly intimidating to walk in here. \u00a0However, the service I've experienced has been truly fantastic. \u00a0I highly recommend it for lunch or afternoon tea.",

However, I'd like to make mention of the stunning afternoon teas with service, scenery and sandwiches to rival its better-known neighbour. I've lost count of the number of friends and family I've brought here as part of their time spent visiting London but can assure you that the feedback has always been extremely positive. With an interior that echoes NYC's Grand Central Terminal, it oozes 1920s charm and refinement without making you feel ill-at-ease. Top that off with phenomenal service and a tray full of delicious scones, petit fours and sandwiches and I'll be talking like I'm an extra in the House of Eliot for days.",

I could not really tell my boss otherwise !!Venue: beautiful, very chic, relatively pretty crowd and quite smart ! The lighting is gorgeous and puts one is a great mood !Food: the most important part for me, alas cold and disappointing ! Come on guys bring all the parts of a dish together or closely follwoing each other. My oysters came with the tabasco only and then 15min later came the putter bread and shallot vinegar(and i checked my watch to see how long it took) !!! Now if i was there with friends I would have called my waiter and reminded him, but since I was with the work crowd I did not want to seem picky (which I know I am)I was so angry, but it got progressively worse !!My colleague, asked for a side of mashed potatoes \u00a0with his main dish and they forgot ! when reminded they took another 10min to bring it and it was COLD when it arrived !! come on, i know i am particular but cold potatoes are disgusting !!!my steak was mediocre. It was clearly good quality meat sadly it was cold by the time it arrived !I think what is best to be had is the breakfast or tea ! hots meals are definitely not their forte !!",

In fact, when I excused myself from the table at some point during the meal, the waitress mentioned to my dinner partner \"Isn't it nice to go out and splurge every once in a while?\" She made a wise choice to say this to him and not me. \u00a0Yes, were appropriately dressy and we ordered well. Maybe it was because we are American? I can only guess at why she deemed us so undeserving. Perhaps if I had arrived with a more prestigious guest I would have been encouraged to enjoy myself.",

    "text": "Just had dinner there, and I found it to be very overrated. Although the architecture and the decor is nice, overall I found it to be very theme-y. There was nothing authentic or interesting about it. I ordered the lobster cocktail. The lobster part of the plate was good - but I was completely disgusted by the mounds of pink salad dressing covering it. It was too sweet, to tangy, and just way too much. I didn't even taste the lobster nor the bits of avocado hidden in the salad. For a main course, I ordered trout and puy lentils. I really can't image anything more plain. The trout was simply steamed, and the lentils were not at all seasoned. I hated it. Is seemed as though everyone else's meals looked better than mine. At a restaurant of this reputation and price, that should never happen. The service was acceptable (I've had worse in London) but not at all remarkable. My waiter was a bit arrogant. I dont care how sophisticated a restaurant thinks it is, service should never, ever be arrogant. I had the Wolseley blanc de blancs brut and it was quite nice. The waiter recommended a red wine for my fish which I enjoyed. I skipped dessert fearing I would be disappointed. Instead, I had a cocktail at the bar which was very good (but I was surrounded by annoying tourists).I give it two starts because the space and the decor was lovely. I loved the nice linen napkins and the banquettes. But overall, it felt gimmicky, like a theme restaurant. And the food was terribly disappointing.",

    "text": "Yes, it is a little posh, but I love nothing more than to get my good weekend threads on and come to the Wolseley to enjoy breakfast or brunch with the girls on a special occasion. This place is just delightful - decadence in abundance but minus the pretentiousness. It is apparently popular among celebrities and the fashion elite but when my boss (who falls into neither of these categories) requested that I book him and a client here for brunch as it was 'just amazing' I thought it could also be the sort of place that I may try as my boss has great taste when it comes to London haunts. When I did take the girls there, we didn't actually spot any celebs or fashion elite (they would probably still be in bed actually), just a group of nice, seemingly normal folk who probably mix in the media circles but keen to keep themselves to themselves. The Wolseley makes fantastic, strong coffee and beautiful freshly baked croissants for breakfast. It also has a coffee room which stays open on weekdays until 12pm. The other menus range from good old fashioned English tea type delicacies such as Eggs Benedict and muffins, right through to American style burgers in addition to a good selection of snacks. Definitely book ahead on the weekend as it is extremely popular. If you are looking to step up you usual breakfast meet with the girls, they will love this. Uber chic.",

I felt very much like a character from a P.G. Wodehouse novel, being waited on by Jeeves...or is it Wooster? Always get confused. The Grade II listed building is all marble floors and imposing pillars and the 20s decor looks like it hasn't changed one iota since its car showroom heyday. Of course it's expensive but a snack here in your best frock will not be soon forgotten. It's glamour, it's glitz, it's a step up from the Ritz!",

Sure, you'll often find yourself next to a TV news anchor enjoying a power breakfast, or a fashion designer picking their way through afternoon tea - a personal favourite was dinner with my dad next to footballer Freddy Ljundberg and his dad - but this is merely testament to the place's lasting quality and style. Five years after it opened, the Piccadilly restaurant is still perpetually busy throughout the day, serving meals and snacks from breakfast through lunch and tea to dinner. The menu spans Europe and America, with long-forgotten teatime classics - has anyone seen a vanilla cream horn for fifty years? - sitting happily alongside burgers and more sophisticated dinner time fare. Although booking is not essential, and it is usually possible to grab a table off the street, if you want to make sure, it's probably a good idea to phone ahead, especially if you want to sit in the lively main room, the most atmospheric place for a spot of people-watching.",

The first thing that will blow your eyes away is the splendor of the building; very high ceilings, really stylish deco, well, everything to make you feel in a nice and posh place.When you come in, a smiling staff welcomes you and makes you feel like you are a regular customer; that is priceless! Then, the food... OMG!!! Breakfasts and brunch have been scaled up to a whole new dimension since I had them there!! The attention to the details is amazing. The pastries are just out of this world!! :)My recommendation: if you want to go for a lunch, make sure you book before to avoid disappointment.I can swear, once you've had your breakfast/brunch there, you will not want to go anywhere else!The Wolseley is somehow bringing a true French touch and blends it with perfection with the British sense of luxury.",
