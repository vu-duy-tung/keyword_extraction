Not so much selection, but still pretty solid. I returned after 1.5 years during a short weekend visit to London, and the man at the counter recognized me! Probably because I was the American girl who always came here alone, but cool nonetheless. The prices were raised, but still a good deal.",

James and I had a foolish goal of \"getting our moneys worth\" by trying to eat more servings than anyone really should, but un-heroically we only made it to 2 plates. oh well, better luck next time, and there WILL be a next time.",

It's not a beautiful place and not one where you'd likely linger, but for a quick fill it's ideal. The posters all over the walls encouraging a vegan lifestyle are an excellent talking point, and one I'm actually in agreement with, but I'm not sure the amount of salt that comes on the food is in line with the health benefits this place claims!As for the food itself, it's good but by no means amazing. As the price is low, the amount of vegetables understandably has to be skimped upon in favour of cheaper options like chick peas. There are chutneys, mini popadoms, salads, brown and pilaf rice, and a selection of basic samosas. It's all good and hearty, but a little on the salty side, and something you'd likely be disappointed in if it weren't for the price.But of course the price is why you're there, so if you're after some shockingly good value Indian food then look no further",

But Indian Veg Bhelpoori House does exactly that: all you can eat vegetarian buffet for \u00a33.95 every day from midday till 11.30pm. Just 5 minutes walk from Angel tube, this place is also in my favourite location in London.When I went on a week day lunchtime, there was no waiting, we were simply shown our table by the lone guy running the show and then left to eat our way through as much as we could manage. There was a selection of salads, three types of rice and four or five curries as well as naan breads and various bhajis. All of the curries were relatively mild, or at least there were no eye-watering dishes (which was good for me but others might see that as a down side). \u00a0You could also help yourself to drinks from the fridge and then pay for everything on your way out.There are some amusing posters on the walls claiming that the vegetarian diet is how all the Bollywood princesses achieve their beauty. The rest of the wall space is full of vegetarianism promotion, and reasons for leaving your carnivore habits. As a meat eater this didn't put me off it actually made me wonder if what they said was right...The food was really delicious and didn't leave me feeling ill (like so many all-you can-eats often do). It wasn't too busy and the people in there were a real mix, from single individuals to families, from friends and couples to people on lunch meetings. It's not the sort of place to go if you want to be treated by attentive waiters, but if you just want some good, tasty food and are happy to serve your self - this place is excellent.",

Combine them with a choice of three different types of rice (including brown rice), papadums, fried onions or some of the interesting orange-flavoured cabbage salads (try it yourself, surprisingly, yes, this combination does work!). Food was good, great value, certainly, especially considering the calorie per pound value ;-) I wish it had been less greasy and more varied in taste. Drinks are very cheap and they have some great fruit juices and all sorts of teas on offer. Even though I've had much better Indian food in London, the uniqueness of this truely, utterly (am I going to far calling it militantly?) vegetarian place was well worth the visit. Make sure you sit in a good spot where you can see as many of the posters as possible. Anybody who has read the weird facts poster on the wall - I'm still trying to figure out what the longest word of the English language is. It said it is a part of the DNA and contains more than 1000 letters?",

The feeling is slightly if a community cafe or a canteen, but that adds to the charm. They have a great selection of drinks ranging from 99p to \u00a32.50.

It has to be one of the cheapest dinners in London. As most Yelpers have been saying, this place does only a few different curries and some weird fried noodle things. It isn't made to order; it's a self-serve vegetarian Indian buffet. Stick to the curries and rice and you'll be all right. The bottled beer (Cobra, Tiger, etc.) is not too expensive either. The best part is the vegetarian propaganda signs which try just about every conceivable angle to justify vegetarianism: \u00a0They give you some pithy Ralph Waldo Emerson quotes. Or if you're a \"hard facts\" type of person and all that Transcendental ho-hum bullshit doesn't get you hot, read all about the quantities of resources that go into producing one kilo of beef. Or find out that Famous People (Einstein, among others) once said things that could, when taken out of context, be construed to be vaguely about the merits of vegetarianism. If none of these really have you convinced, look no further for vegetarian inspiration than one of the restaurant's most famous customers, 1994 Miss South Asia, posing happily with the owner. If you're forever unconvinced and just have to land your eyes somewhere, try the \"Thoughtful Quotes\" sign, which assembles little disparate nuggets of wisdom, from Picasso on art to (ironically?) Goebbels on propaganda and the state.",

Even the most devout carnivorous i have taken here have rolled out suitable stuffed and satisfied. With salads, breads, at least three varieties of curry jammed packed with veg and pulses and brown rice as well as the usual pilaf on offer you are guaranteed to find something to suit your tastes. The staff are really friendly and diligent - the buffet is never empty or cold as can often happen with restaurants of this kind. This is a great place for vegans, and they can cater for parties of up to 20 this is one place you absolutely must sample at least once.

Fried things are not great cold, however. In my opinion, just get a sizable plate of rice, slop on the least greasy looking curry, add some pickle/onion/chutney and go to town. Then go back, even if you're not hungry, because that's what one does at a buffet. Eating out, filling your impoverished student tummy, and all for under a fiver?

I can't rate it higher than 3 stars though as it has the Marmite affect, you either love it or you hate it. The basics are simple, you pay a couple of quid to sit and eat you body weight in veggie curry. Expect lentils, sloppy dishes and self service. It's really what I would call the lazy dinner option as it's on my way home from work.It's around \u00a32.50 for the food and about \u00a31 for each drink. The tables are a little squished together and the decorations tacky as hell but that is all part of it's charm. If your not a veggie when you go in you'll definitely consider it by the time you walk out, if not for the tasty food but for the vegetarian propaganda that is slapped on every inch of wall available. It's also a good place to eat on your own as it's fast and you don't end up hanging around all night and feeling that little bit uncomfortable.This little place is also hidden from the tourists so generally you get a lovely mix of locals and their friends. Well done Indian Veg Bhelpoori House! Oh and if you can't remember the name of this place when you are there, just walk down the street and it's a few doors down from The Elbow Rooms.",

You are eating organic ingredients. You can eat the place into bankrupcy (please don't). I can only ever have one plate. Most importantly, in my opinion, it tastes great.I highly recommend adding a portion of their orange, lemon salad. It adds a light, refreshing, citrussy bite to what could be quite a stodgy meal. \u00a0If my 5* rating doesn't lure you in then maybe the all powerful celebrity of Miss Philippines uk \u00a0will.

The decor is nothing fancy; rather there are posters everywhere advocating vegetarianism which I loved. And blaming carnivores for warfare :)I am drinking a star because the owner/person at the till was pretty grouchy. I asked him what some of the sides were as there were no identification on them and that request seemed to annoy him. He also just grumbled a thank you when I paid.

    "text": "Indian veg has been a long established restaurant in Angel on Chapel market, opened in 1985 and still successfully running today. Although set up very much like a canteen with its simple green cramped layout, it's will probably be one of the most memorable vegetarian Indian you'll go to serving a large variety of delicious vegan and vegetarian dishes, self service buffet style and costing only \u00a36.50 whilst being surrounded by walls covered with strong ethics posters about animal cruelty, being vegetarian and some with more factual information about food. It's like no other vegetarian Indian restaurant I've been to which gives it that bit of unique charm. It's a very relaxing no fuss place with not even music playing giving a sense of tranquility or for some the silence can be too much to handle.We were pretty much seated straight away and from there it's pretty much help yourself to the homely cooked vegetarian dishes in the buffet area. Staff were quite absent but somehow made me more comfortable reaching for seconds and even thirds. They were very helpful when needed, like pouring out tap water when you ask. The buffet area was divided between starters which included onion bhaji and fried vegetables, Mains consisted of vegetarian and vegan curries such as paneer with peas curry and mixed vegetable curry. Also a wide selection of sides such as aloo peas, mixed dal, bread salad and spicy potato mashed and all can be eaten with brown rice or pilau rice.On the other side were all the raw salads such as carrot and white cabbage and red and white onion salad and the healthy option of fruit as a dessert. To be honest, the dishes changes quite frequently as last time I went they also had poppadoms. Also there is a longer list of desserts but that's on a separate menu where you will have to pay extra. Everything I had (which was pretty much everything) was lovely and homely. All seasoned perfectly, wholesome and flavoursome. You must try the spicy mashed potatoes which were just incredibly fluffy and very well spiced and out the mains I enjoyed the paneer peas the best with the added cheese, giving it that extra creamy touch. Everything was quite mild so suitable for most palates. Like I said before, don't feel bad about asking for tap water even at the low prices. They are more than happy to serve you it if you ask. There is also a huge selection of bottle drinks at the front but even better is a whole menu of homemade drinks with vegan options such as soya mango lassi. Indian Veg is a restaurant I highly recommend for everyone. Even though it's vegetarian I didn't feel like I was missing out. It's so budget friendly as well offering a self service buffet 7 days a week, both lunch and dinner.",

    "text": "Great philosophy and solid food for excellent value, though I wouldn't give it more than three stars. Everything was literally Indian veg, per the restaurant name. A reasonable variety and good flavours overall. However, nothing spectacular to blow my mind. It was literally worth the money we paid for. Service was good overall, though we did not have much interaction with the servers, given it was buffet. Ambience was cozy and local -- a very Indian kind of atmosphere. Walls were covered with vegetarian propagandistic posters. One of my friends said this place has remained exactly the same since he first visitors twenty five years ago. Gives you a sense of the the philosophy of the place.",

They have some finely chopped salads, a variety of curries (although a lot based on peas and potatoes) and some crispy onion rings and mini bhajis to put on top.Walls are plastered with vegetarian propaganda and the virtues of a vegetarian diet.They have a variety of fruit juices (cans and bottles) and also fruit lassis to order.Don't come here if you want an overpriced concept eatery with a scene and hip design and like to queue up round the block for the privilege. You won't like it.Do come here if you like down to earth quirky places that are unique, good value and want to eat straight away.",

    "text": "A small and atmospheric (in its own special way) place which provides truly great food for a very reasonable amount of money. It's a buffet so you can eat as much as you want from those amazing vegetarian dishes, including a salad bar with several salad choices (I love the onion salad which is basically pure onion with spices - super healthy but don't eat it if you're on a date!). You can get a wide variety of drinks, including lassi, both with cow and soya milk. They are reasonably priced but sadly not bottomless haha. The only reason I give 4* rather than 5 is because the general atmosphere is very modest and may not appeal to some people. There are a lot of posters on the walls advocating vegetarian eating against anything else, sometimes quite aggressively, and that could appear just slightly annoying. For me personally it's not a problem at all but I thought it's worth reflecting in my review. Also staff can seem a bit cold but if you are a regular they will quickly start recognising you and being quite friendly. In concluding - I'd say it's definitely worth visiting and having a meal at the Indian Veg, especially if you want some yummy vegetarian Indian food. Beautiful meal for a beautiful price!",

I've been here 3 times, and only because each time I've tried so hard to forget it, I did! \"Vegetarians Paradise\", only if you are a veggie into S&M.I've lived in India, and I've visited here with Indians, and I've visited here with vegetarians. And none of us would rate the food highly. It suffers from the same problems that can plague low-cost 'Indian/Bangladeshi' curry/poori houses: the food is just bad.How can a culture that can serve me the most amazing veg food, enough to make me abandon meat, often at the side of a road from a cart, be so miserable in a large kitchen restaurant? Stodgy, lacking favour, chapati/roti not fresh (often stale in the banquet, where everthing just is luke-warm). Oh I could go on... Please, let me do you a favour and save you from here. If, like me, you crave good Indian food then just walk to Millman Street across from the Brunswick and visit Salaam Namaste. If you need good veg food, then go elsewhere.(You got a star because we'd a great laugh once bopping around to Salmaan Khan's song Bhanjara)",

Anyway, the place can seat quite some people. there were 3 types of rice and 4 types of curries.. tbh they all tasted blend and tasted about the same- and yellowish with tons of potato. the only more tastable one was the coconut based curry with paneer cheese, and potato. just a note, all of their dishes are heavy on potato. it was like eating a potato feast with the occasional appearance of some chick peas and cabbages. remember. potatoes.then there's the bhaja -fried onion dish and another fried dish, pompadom and some domed shaped crisp bread. all quite oily. heart disease here I come! 3 types of cabbage salad, and 2 onion salad. comes with 2 watered down salad sauces. oh, and some unhealthy crispy rice topping thingies. and yep, that's all. sure 4.95 all you can eat would def fill you up with the help of a stomach full of potatoes. but I'm just not sure about the quality and variety, and feels like I can get better curry from M&S.",

Yes, \u00a32.95! 15 years later, it's soared to a heady \u00a35.95, but c'mon guys, that ain't bad for all you can stuff in your fat face, is it. And it's damn tasty. And it's entirely vegetarian. So all in all, this herbivore is pretty bloody happy. Don't forget to try the salads, especially the yellow fella - it's not all about the curry, you know. And treat yourself to a delicious lassi. And if your date doesn't offer quite the scintillating conversation you'd hoped for, the walls are absolutely plastered with vegetarian propaganda to keep you entertained through your meal. Woohoo, have your \u00a35.95 (cash only, please) at the ready!",

I am not a vegetarian but I didn't even miss the meat.I feel like there's a joke in there somewhere...Yeah so anyone who has ever tried to spend less than 10 on a meal in London will understand why that's the equivalent of finding a unicorn.",

If you're poor, hungry and cold, head for this place - It's a bargain.

The buffet food selection is second to none of the average Indian restaurants and take aways anywhere in London, freshly cooked bread still warm being my favourite, and the drinks selection is just the best around. Healthy fruit juices from British farms, premium and regular fizzy drinks, freshly prepared vegan mango lassi, and a plump desserts list. The decor won't please if you're hankering after the sterile, hospital waiting room style that seems to be in favour among the crowds these days, it's a cross between a small family run eatery and a diner with walls completely plastered with vegan articles, trivia and dietary facts, on giant posters. I loved the ambiance and the truly diverse crowd, a real local original and a relaxed atmosphere.",

    "text": "At \u00a35.50, this vegetarian buffet is good value. There's a selection of salads, rice, poppadoms and unidentified fried dough things, with three different curries and dahls to choose from. The poppadoms could have been slightly crispier but that's a minor thing. It was all quite tasty and maybe the spiced potato mash was slightly too tasty. There was a lot of potato. The curry is too greasy to have buffet-level amounts of though. It's bring your own drink which cuts down the costs, but there is a wide variety of non-alcoholic drinks available to buy there too. Being honest, it's not the food that would have me coming back here, it's nice enough but there are other attractions...I'm definitely no seal clubber but I am as partial to lumps of nutritious animal tissue as the next man. Indian Veg Bhelpoori House is not my usual scene but I love vegetarian food too. However here animal tissue consumption of any kind is, let's say, frowned upon. THE WALLS SHOUT AT YOU. About lots of things. But mainly about the eating meat. Every surface is covered in incredible, bizarre signage. One particular sign (over the salad bar) extolls the benefits of drinking water. I thought the benefits of drinking water would be fairly standard but apparently it \"aids body lubrication\". What even is \"body lubrication\"? \u00a0Is body lubrication just excessive sweating? Am I slipping into some kind of figure hugging amniotic sleeping bag? We will never know. I my have misread the sign however under the extraterrestrial blue light of the most amazing light fixture I have ever seen. It is the chandelier belonging in the play dungeon of a mortician-cum-80s-pimp. From the outside you would never know it was a restaurant and you wouldn't really be any the wiser on the inside. I should really be talking about the food but the visual assault on the senses is extraordinary and a main reason I will be returning. It is a relaxing, affordable place to go, if you can find it and if you can deal with the placard-laden interior. This place is Morrissey in the guise of an obscure subcontinental buffet restaurant.",
