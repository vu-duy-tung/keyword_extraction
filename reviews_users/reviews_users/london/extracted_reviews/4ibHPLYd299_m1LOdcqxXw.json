I must say over all, delicious. My 4 star rating comes from the service. We sat downstairs and as another review stated, we felt a little forgotten about. We were there to have a nice relaxing dinner, but by the time we were ready for the check we waited almost 30 minutes and then started to hunt for our server upstairs!",

I had a carafe of tempranillo, fig and goat cheese starter, authentic beef bourgignon, espresso and chocolate mousse. \u00a333 isn't cheap, but for that meal is affordable, because it all *was* gourmet. The decor is fun and colorful, the waitresses friendly and authentically French. It's possible to spend less there, for less dinner: the tempranillo was \u00a311 of my total. But the mousse was especially good. :)",

    "text": "Interesting place. It's a great deal, particularly considering the location. The food's average-to-good, but definitely nothing to write home about - classic bistro cooking, the flaws being e.g. too tough beef bourguignon, lack of flavour in a couple of the dishes. However, a few things let it down. First, the service, while friendly, is slow and inattentive (whenever we needed one of the waiting staff, there was no-one to be seen and I spent more time than I liked trying to catch their eye). Second, the decor is basic but a few things need some touching up, and e.g. the cutlery/glassware look very much like they belong in a school canteen. Third, the wine selection is very ordinary, which is shame for a French restaurant - we had one of the more expensive bottles and, while inoffensive, it wasnt very interesting. I'll definitely bear it in mind for the future, but you won't find me going out of my way to come back, and especially not with a date or someone I'm trying to impress. There are much better restaurants in this kind of category (Comptoir Gascon instantly springs to mind, as does Le Mercury).",

At two courses for \u00a310 the menu provides great value and often contains some exciting ingrdients such as duck breast or sucking pig. The staff are casual but attentive and friendly. It is often busy has a vibrant atmosphere.Another plus point of the restaurant is the way that they respond to a problem. We had an awful meal there (on one of our 30 odd visits) and they could not do enough to put it right. Without wanting to sound too sentimental this restaurante has been part of some great memories for me and everyone should give it a go. Some of the best value food in London.",

    "text": "Well, it was our last night in London and we were looking for a suitable restaurant. \u00a0Being the Yelper that I am, I set about with researching. \u00a0We have some picky eaters in our group, so that added another element of difficulty. \u00a0As a bunch of Francophiles, I thought a French restaurant would be a good choice. \u00a0Based on the preceeding Yelp reviews, we finally settled on Savoir Faire. \u00a0I was intrigued by the basement grotto, so when I made the reservation on Open Table, I requested that we be seated down there. \u00a0This was good because we got a bit raucous and silly as the meal progressed. \u00a0Well, we were not disappointed by Savoir Faire in the least. We all ordered the two course, prix fixe menu. \u00a0I began with the roasted figs accompanied by stilton and prosciutto. \u00a0They were just lovely! \u00a0Then I tucked into the magret de carnard, but I felt that the duck was a bit over-cooked (Erin agreed). \u00a0I also had a nibble of Maeve's beef bourguignon. \u00a0Delicious! \u00a0The gnocchi that Courtney had was a bit odd looking, but she said it was good. \u00a0Chris and Miguel both had the Creole chicken and they cleaned their plates. \u00a0We also had about 5 bottles of some white wine (Chardonnay, I believe). \u00a0For desert we ordered a couple creme-brulees, the banoffee pie (my favorite!), and a very sad chocolate mousse (more like a pudding cup). \u00a0The wait-staff was nice, but we often felt a bit neglected at times. I guess that's what you get for hiding away in a cave. \u00a0The murals on the walls also provided some amusement for our group and some of them were pretty risque! Overall, a tres bon experience!",

Overall an ok experience, but nothing really that stood out, hence we probably won't be going back.So to the details... As we arrived we were seated downstairs and the whole area smells of a cellar or a damp basement, which isn't very pleasant but you quickly get used to it. One of the reviewers mentioned images of 'naked ladies' plastering the walls, which we've seen none of - a bit disappointing:)The service was very friendly and attentive, but the food took forever to arrive, so make sure that you allocate plenty of time if you decide to visit. We ordered a french wine (unfortunately I don't remember the name of it), which was recommended as 'owners favourite' and it was in fact quite nice and affordable.The dishes are quite big, so even the most demanding stomachs shouldn't be left disappointed, while those with smaller tummies make sure to NOT eat the bread that's brought in at the start, I know it's fresh, with a crunchy crust and tasty, but otherwise you won't be able to finish your dishes:) I had lamb following recommendations of numerous reviewers and my wife had duck. Both dishes were quite nice, but they were very much like home-cooked food I haven't felt anything exquisite about them.So to sum up, the service is great, food takes a while to arrive, the dishes are more like home-cooked rather than French exquisite cuisine.",

For me the atmosphere was quite right - this place is 20 years old and has been in private hands - a good sign with so many chains and cooperations popping up in this neighbourhood. Service was very friendly and good. I can totally recommend this place and would go back - maybe even will on my next visit in London.",

This is honest cooking from honest ingredients and served well, and it is not a fancy place. I mean to compliment them by saying their food was like \"grandma's good Sunday cooking\". We each had goose rilletes, then Burgundian beef stew and lamb shank both with creamy mashed potatoes, carrots and broccoli. The wine we selected was adequate, and priced well. The ambience is humble but clean and quiet enough to converse. Overall very satisfied.",

We felt comfortable just hanging out for a long while and enjoying a leisurely Sunday meal with friends. I had high hopes for the fried goat's cheese. It was good, but I'd give it a pass next time. Also, two people at the table ordered ceasar salads and said they tasted oddly salty. Other than those complaints, everything at the table got rave reviews from starters to mains and desserts. And the wine! Delicious. For location, good food, and price point, it's definitely a gem that we'd go back to anytime.",

Based on Yelp reviews, we dropped in here after exhausting ourselves with an afternoon in the British Museum. Like what everyone else says, it was a treat.. the *best* meal we had during our vacation (but.. well.. not that much competition really.. people are not kidding when they complain about British cuisine), reasonable prices (because we dropped in early, around 6 they gave us a special, lower-priced \"Pre-show\" menu, I guess with smaller portions and one course options that suited us just fine). Enjoyed our meal and wine and just sitting in front of that damn fine window looking at the world come and go so much we ended up ordering dessert and coffee.. just to stay a little longer.",

    "text": "My mother and grandmother were visiting London and I was tasked with finding a place near them for a nice meal on a Friday evening. I am pleased to say that Savoir Faire ticked all the boxes we needed for this situation: we needed decent food but not too expensive, with a decent atmosphere but not too loud, walking distance from Russell square, and able to take booking at short notice. We tried a few Italian places near by, but they were not picking up the phone. Their loss, as Savoir Faire allowed us to book online with very little notice; and all four members of our party enjoyed ourselves.The menus were printed on a couple of sheets of A4, in about as slapdash a fashion as you could muster, and then stapled together. But that didn't detract from the selection of great sounding French dishes. The selection was a little modest, but it did have a \"light menu\" of smaller plates and salads. Ideal for the varied crowd at our table.From the photos I expected quite small but beautifully executed gourmet French dishes, but in actuality it was more classic cooking at affordable prices. That is no bad thing: I cannot resist a beef bourguignon and this one did not disappoint. Flavoursome beef just melted in the mouth alongside creamy mash and rich sauce. Even the most basic of seasonal vegetables; carrots and broccoli, were lovely. Everyone else seemed very pleased with their lamb shank, chicken salad, and duck breast.The service was great too; numerous waitresses were very attentive, swift with drinks, and then left us to chatter long after our last course was finished. The freedom to relax and finish drinks after a meal is a real plus on any venue, I absolutely detest being hurried out of the door or hassled for the bill.The menu as I mentioned was a little on the small side from what I'd expect, but it was by no means bad, and everything we ordered food-wise was excellent. The only real complaint I could give was that the Irish coffee I had afterwards was pretty foul - but I'm not going to get on the back of French restaurant too much for this mistake.If you like classic French dishes, a good atmosphere in a relatively small place, and a good bite to eat at short notice, you should definitely pop in here.",

    "text": "This review covers two different visits:1- After our exhausting British museum visit one afternoon, my friend and I stumbled upon this tiny restaurant and recalling that it had been packed the previous night we figured it would be a good place for a much needed dose of caffeine and sweets. \u00a0At the time we were the only customers there. \u00a0Turns out they have the best latte and Banoffee pie in town, and with a French name you'd expect nothing less- except when we got their business card we noticed that the owner is actually Persian! \u00a0Classic switcheroo! \u00a0Service was also good (by one of the owners I believe). \u00a0There we rested like weary travelers of the days of yore, connected to their free wi-fi, snapped a pic or two, and eventually headed out, highly satisfied with our experience. \u00a0 4 stars2- We returned a few days later, in the evening this time- hoping that the delicious offering on our previous visit was a prelude to amazing things to come on the dinner front. \u00a0We made a reservation and when we showed up the place was packed, which we took as a good sign, but there was an eerie tension in the air - most customers either looked irritated or were actually complaining about something - it looked as if many had been waiting for a really long time for their food to arrive. \u00a0This time, our waitress had a bit of an attitude problem, which for a small family run restaurant was a little unusual, but luckily wine came to our rescue, there was no great delay with our food and when it did arrive, while not mind-blowing, was above average. \u00a0The place definitely has an 'intimate' setting, not necessarily in the romantic sense- well perhaps that too- but it definitely feels cramped when busy, so be prepared to get fairly up close and personal with your neighbour. \u00a0As a result, it doesn't score highly for me on the comfort front. \u00a03 starsp.s. \u00a0nowhere is this size inconvenience more... ummm... inconvenient, than the shockingly small bathroom - absolutely horrible- it's midget sized I tell ya! \u00a0Avoid a call of nature at all costs - or perhaps try it to fully appreciate my horror! \u00a0Overall 3.5 stars but since we can't do halves, I'll round it up to 4.",

I've been here three times now for my work's Christmas lunch over the years (including 2013) and have been happy each time. Savoir Faire's chief strength is its impressive value and quality for the prices charged. Sure, it's been overhauled by Le Mercury on Upper Street, but it's nevertheless much better than most restaurants in its price range. Meat is tender, vegetables well-cooked and desserts satisfying. Service is friendly and accommodating, to the point of allowing us to this year stay a little longer to indulge in some post-lunch quiz action.Here's to Christmas 2014!",

It was the nicest salad I think I've ever had! So many fresh and well-prepared ingredients and beautifully char-grilled chicken to top. The creme brulee wasn't the best ever, but it was tasty (and I can rarely resist a creme brulee)! \u00a0My husband had the beef bourguignon and raved about it.

    "text": "I love Yelp. And I love it even more for directing me to the wonderful and divine Savoir Faire. This restaurant is like a breath of fresh country-air in the centre of a busy, bustling and let's be honest, slightly dirty city. Family owned and family run, this is a great slice of rustic French cuisine. I went here with a group of nine on a Friday night. Our table was ready, our waitress was superb and we were made to feel really welcome. The wine list was a hit with my partner (the aspiring amateur sommelier) and we kicked off the evening with a lovely Riesling from Alsace, called Rifile. This was so good (not too sweet, and perfectly balanced), and I even went to my parents local wine cavern Byrne's of Clitheroe, to find some more bottles of the stuff. Fab. I went for the foie gras - wonderfully rich and perfectly matched with the apple and brioche. For my main I went for the Sea Bass which was again, exquisitely cooked and the tomato and pepper sauce delicate and flavoursome. Between nine of us we hit most of the items on the 2 courses for \u00a316 deal. Bargain. Other highlights included the salmon gateaux and the rich duck dish. Yum. We were so relaxed we even took in some desserts and coffee. My friend even venturing to try some grappa!!!I did also venture into the small private dining area as I was intrigued by the murals. Now, I thought from previous reviews that the murals were hand painted BY Lautrec, now I'm no Art Historian, but they looked pretty new to be around 100 years old. So, I think they're probably a copy and homage at best. Still pretty though!Quite simply, Savoir Faire is great, fab and brilliant all at the same time. A perfect place to chill with friends whilst sampling some top notch French food. This isn't haute cuisine, but all portions are generous, tasty and definitely value for money. I'll be back in a flash, as soon as I persuade some more friends to go, judging by their emails the next day about how fab the food was, I don't think it will be long.",

The decor is also lovely with an ambiance that makes me feel within the renaissance era. The food is fantastic and quite authentically French. What is surprising is the price. For what is one of the better dining experiences in London, this restaurant is very affordable. At under \u00a320 for a main meal this is excellent value.I hear there are secret tunnels within the restaurant that you can dine in for a really exclusive feel.

I've been several times, and have never been disappointed.My first time there was with a group of 6 on a Friday night--we had no reservations and the entire lower ground floor was reserved for a party of 40. Rather than shoo us out, the friendly (understandably flustered) wait staff seated us in a cavern-like room behind the curtain, under the stairs. (My friends and I affectionately refer to this room as the lair.) \u00a0 Because it was such a busy night, the kitchen was a bit slow, but we were kept happy with the well-priced (not so bad) carafes of house red (their old-fashioned pimms is also mixed quite well). The food was (later I found out, always is) amazing--the lamb dishes and goat cheese appetizers are my favorites, and the desserts were wonderful (and good for sharing). \u00a0 After we were finished, the waitresses (probably exhausted), let us sit for as long as we wanted to finish our wine. I would recommend this place to anyone--for a group, a date, or even by yourself because it's that freaking good.",

This is a very veg-unfriendly place. There was only one vegetarian option among the main course ... gnocchi. My friends didn't like it and they ended up having a horrible dinner, made worse by the fact that i enjoyed my share of the food. So i ended up having to pay for all of them :(So this turns out to be one of those restaurants where i would like to come often but i won't be able to since i can't bring my friends along.

(Let's just say that the singing candelabras named Lumiere and the les poissons loving chefs were absent from the experience.)Humble and unpretentious, Savoir Faire has been one of my favourite London dining experiences to date. Not because of fancy views or exquisite menus, but because these folks are living their dream and doing it authentically -- and that is beyond admirable. Savoir Faire is not a chain nor a franchise, but rather a 10-year old family run restaurant. \u00a0It was so family run that when I called for a reservation, I had to spell out the words \"E-i-g-h-t P-M\" so the French speaking host could decipher my American accent. Each table gets a basket of freshly baked bread, every menu item is made 100% in house, and they source only the best-wines-for the-money. In fact, the entire experience was quite affordable -- a two course meal for \u00a316 seemed like stealing.On that note, I stole the grilled mushroom with melted mozzarella and roasted pepper AND the Nile perch with roasted garlic and lime beurre blanc. Others indulged in grilled mussels, pan fried foie gras, lacquered duck magret, treacle-glazed pork belly, wild boar and mushroom terrine ... it's agonizing typing this out because it makes me want to turn around and go right back. Really, the experience was perfect. Quaint, unpretentious, delicious, affordable -- and to give credit where credit is due: all thanks to Tom E's talk thread suggestion! \u00a0;) God, I love Yelp!

    "text": "I'm sad to say that my romance with Yelp has been on the rocks recently. Don't get me wrong, she treats me right- it's me that has been the lazy one not putting the effort into our relationship. She give, give ,gives, telling me where all the best restaurants are and tracking my favourite reviewers. Like an ever faithful lover, she's always there when I walk in through the door at the end of the day, tired and emotional with no energy to type. And what do I do in return? Skim the cream of the crop for reviews before sneaking off to...watch TV! Well I'm a changed woman now. Savoir Faire has made me see the error of my ways. A restaurant this good needs to be Yelped with tender love and respect. Finding places like this is what made me fall for Yelp so hard in the first place and, it made me realise, I know we're meant to be together, through the good times and the bad...So anyway, to the restaurant. Where to start? With the food? The incredible sweet cinnamon glazed duck breast with an oh so tiny cube of dauphinoise? Or the phenomenal (and pungent) mussels floating in garlic butter?Or maybe you'll get a better sense of Savoir Faire if I tell you about the wine. Our fruity Rioja was the hussy of vinos. She went with all of us, snogging us hard before leaving us desperate for more. For the second time in this review- I was in love (so I wear my heart on my sleeve!).If I've left you in any doubt, Savoir Faire is an amazing restaurant. Everything about the place is as French as you could imagine, from the staff to the decor. Stunning Lautrec murals are painted across the walls in the back room and baskets of home made bread arrive at the tables with the minimum of fuss. The prices here are incredible too. Two courses of tasty, tasty French fare cost only \u00a316 and I am in no doubt that it was worth every penny. After this rambling review all that's left for me to say is Yelp, I'm sorry. I'll never take you for granted again.",

    "text": "After telling as many of my friends as possible about Savoir Faire, I still don't know why most people have never heard if it.It's a small ground floor French restaurant with a dungeon-like cellar perfect for groups. The cellar consists of the entrances to several former smuggling tunnels dug to take moonshine and stuff into Soho from outside the old city limits. These tunnels are mostly blocked now but the entrances make for wondereful private dining alcoves and each has been fitted with a large table and candlelight. If you are thinking of somewhere good to dine with a big group, then think no more - a private tunnel table at Savoir Faire is ideal.Did I mention yet that the walls of some of the alcoves are painted with murals by Toulouse Lautrec?Or how about that George Orwell used to come here to write his weekly Observer column?On top of that location and history stuff, it's also an enjoyable meal. French food in London can run so ridiculously expensive for tiny portions with an astronomical wine list and snotty waiters - not here. The food is well-priced French classics, hearty yet elegant, the wine is carafe-served and affordable and the staff seem to be a decent bunch. It's like they want to break every stereotype for french restaurants.The final bonus of this great find is that it's right close to The End and is a great place to start a big night out with friends.",

In terms of the food alone, however, I wasn't all that impressed. The menu sounded promising, but I was actually disappointed with how the food turned out -- not that it was bad, it was just average to good at best -- not quite up there with the consistent 5-star reviews. My steak carpaccio was seared far too much; the sauces for the duck and the lamb tasted the same to me, the duck had too much fat and not enough crisp. Everything else was fine, but not spectacular.Bottom line -- I like it, and it's definitely worth checking out, but doesn't quite go up there with my favorite places to eat in London.",

An off the menu tarte tartin closed. R. had soup and then then a very nicely done sea bass. Kids were delighted with omelette du fromage and burger & frites. \u00a0The wine menu did present a bit more of a challenge than I would have expected with too many single grape new world wines but we were happy with our french bordeaux, young but a nice light taste that fit our fish and risotto.

Maybe it even deserves 4 stars, not sure.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to Savoir Faire on the basis of the 4.5 star Yelp rating. Thinking we were in a cosmopolitan city like London, the rating meant a lot to us in selecting the restaurant. \u00a0We were very disappointed.We started with the mussels which were grilled and then served with a pernod butter garlic sauce. \u00a0The mussels were the best of the dinner and we rated them a 7 on a 10 point scale. \u00a0Things went down hill quickly from there.The second course was the warm goat cheese and fig salad on arugula (\"rocket\") bed. \u00a0It was mediocre, despite our high expectations. \u00a0It could have had more arugula which would have added to the experience, and fresher \u00a0rather than wilted.The third (main course) was the Entrocote Steak Frites. \u00a0We ordered it medium rare. \u00a0It was cooked to the right temperature, but the steak was as tough as shoe leather, despite the chef pounding it for a long time before cooking it. \u00a0The french fries were okay.For dessert, we had Vanoffee which was a pie with toffee and banana and whipped cream on a graham cracker shell. \u00a0It was good but not spectacular.The service was pretty good and we had no complaints about the serve staff. \u00a0Finally, the ambiance was just fair. \u00a0No table cloths, paper napkins, etc.In summary, Savoir Faire does not deserve more than a 2 star rating. \u00a0It is inexpensive, but very average.",

    "text": "Cutest little french bistro in central London. Two of us were there for dinner on a Sunday night and it gets really busy so try and make a reservation ahead of time. Dinner comprised of a set menu of two courses with a range of options for the starter and mains. We had the grilled mussels and pan fried foie gras as our appetizers and they were both excellent. For our mains, we had the fillet of sea bass and the braised lamb shank. Although the lamb was good, the sea bass was definitely better - so good! Tried the creme brulee for dessert but I thought it was pretty average. There is also an extensive wine list to choose from. There can be a little bit of a wait for the food to arrive when the restaurant is really busy, but it's not excessively slow by any means. The food is excellent, the atmosphere is cozy, the decor is quirky and fun (there's writing on the ceiling!) and the service is friendly and efficient - definitely worth a visit.",

I couldn't give this restaurant a higher rating though because of its 2 star hygiene rating by Camden council, \u00a0I don't really understand why such an otherwise amazing restaurant would take such a lax attitude to food satety but it isn't a good sign. Hopefully they'll take it on board and try to improve as it's otherwise a wonderful independent restaurant in central London, a welcome alternative to so many identikit chains.",

The flavors are simply astonishing... Although the duck texture was average. Even still.. Epic dish! This is a return over and over places folks! Oh and... Price? It will make you spin your head... The prices are that of a typical chain... Not too high. How? I dunno but I am coming back tomorrow.Ok update (3 minutes after posting!) the texture of the duck is killing me... SO chewy! But... Still 5 star. Why? Flavor... Unique flavor in the whole dish... Everything on the plate is so enriched in unique and DELICIOUS flavor I don't care. Plus it's only a few pieces like that.Sorry 4-star review people who always do 4 starts even when they say it's great! (Why oh why do people do that?)... This is 5 star at its best!Oh... And I hate the French. But you get five stars for food!",

Stepping off a busy London street you are immediately transported to a bistro that could be anywhere in France though I like to imagine myself being somewhere in Provence, wild fields of lavender filling the air with an aroma like to no other....anyway....back to the food!For my starter I went for Goose Rillettes served with Spiced Plums, the rillettes had an excellent texture, neither too fatty or to smooth, there was still a nice consistency to it. I sometimes find rillettes made more like a pate, blitzed to hell and back. The goose with the sweet and spicy plums was a lovely match and very tasty.For my main Herb-crusted Rump of Lamb with Celeriac Puree, Balsamic braised Beetroot and Herb and Tomato Jus. Im a sucker for lamb with a crust and this was done supremely well. Cooked with great attention in a pan then oven roasted to melt in the crust the lamb was still beautifully pink. Celeriac is one of my favourite vegetables and the puree was smooth and well seasoned. Delicious.Washed all of the lovely food down with a bottle of red, reasonably priced and delicious.Finished the night with a French coffee and toddled off into the night very content.",

There are two menus, the lighter menu is 15 pounds and includes an entree and your choice of a dessert or appetizer and then there is the 23 pound dinner menu that includes an appetizer and entree. Both are available at dinner periods and both are delicious (I ordered off the pricier dinner menu while my partner ordered off the 15 pound menu and we were both beyond satisfied). I had a glass of house red (\u00a34) and we both shared a dessert afterwards (\u00a36.50) and the best dinner I've had in London came to a well-spent \u00a350.Service was prompt and friendly and they were even able to fit us in without a reservation, though we came very early. If you plan to eat here after 5:30 I would definitely make a reservation. Off of the cheaper menu I highly recommend the duck legs and off the more expensive menu the lamb shank is delectable.PROs:- Great french cooking- Not dirt cheap, but for what you get it feels like theft- Very close to the British Museum, 5 min from the main entrance. About 10 minutes walk from Holborn station.CONs:- It gets busy quickly, even on weekdays. Make a reservation unless you are willing to take a risk.",

The service started off as very attentive and we ordered a bottle of house white wine. The waitress quickly brought us a bottle, poured it, and left. Before we knew it we realized she had poured us each a glass of red wine-not what we ordered. This issue would have also been prevented if they showed us the bottle of wine and permitted us an initial taste as every other restaurant does. After much confusion with another waitress who was on her first day and barely spoke English, she was able to help us to amend the issue and she then brought us our white wine. She filled the glasses to the brim-no exaggeration.The starter and main meal was delicious. My friend got the mussels which I would highly recommend. The lentil moussaka was also delicious. Salads were pretty standard, nothing amazing. Overall I would recommend this restaurant.",

Ambiance: small casual restaurant, dining on the street level and a dining room downstairs. Not very lavish but quaint. The location is great for people watching, located on a busy intersection. The narrow staircase and lighting on the way to the loo could use some work.Service: two servers at dinner were very helpful, efficient and welcoming. The servers for lunch were not as pleasant, one hardly said a word but smiled a lot. The other server yelled at tired Japanese tourists who sat on the chairs outside. Not very hospitable.Food: we really enjoyed our dinner here. I ordered the baked mussels which came in an escargot dish and had the traditional butter, herb and garlic butter. Great for dipping the wonderful bread. My wife ordered the steak frites and I had the calf's liver. Both were very good. No dessert. Lunch was not as flavorful. We ordered salad, Caesar and the house salad. Neither were exciting, lettuce was not crispy and the vinaigrettes were not very flavorful. Add the less than enthusiastic servers, I wish we went elsewhere for lunch.",

The place is small and a little quaint, and quirky with the, interesting, wallpapers. It seems really underwhelming upon entrance, but the food we had was truly phenomenal especially considering the prices.The two-course prix fixe menu was a great find in an otherwise such an expensive city. I had mackerel as an appetizer followed by sea bass. Both were cooked and seasoned really well. We also had a bottle of tempranillo and finished the meal with cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and lemon tart. It truly felt like fine dining on a shoestring, and we got the best of both worlds. My friends also raved about everything they ordered (caesar salad, lentil moussaka, etc). I believe we overheard the servers speak French, which only provided a reassuring sign since there's a better chance the chefs are French as well. The service might be a bit lacking at times - or am I just too used to the American standards - but it doesn't detract at all from the overall value of the restaurant.",

    "text": "A cozy restaurant with fresh ingredients with a homecooked touch. I actually felt as if I was sitting in a house being served by my friend's family. The food is good, but waiting almost an hour to have it put in front of you was tough. I had a group lunch and we were on a tight schedule so we promptly ordered at noon hoping to be done before 1PM since we had class. We all ordered different things around the table and were served our appetizers while we waited for main courses. As we were sitting there, I could tell we were getting antsy and constantly checking the time because we knew we were running out and we were going to be late. Not really sure why it took nearly an hour for the food to come out, but I think it's something they should work on for people on a time crunch during lunch time.When it comes down to the food, it was nice. Not exactly out of this world amazing, but it was definitely a nice light meal. The service was good since we were the only ones in the restaurant, but my only gripe is the long wait for the food to arrive at the table. Maybe I'll be back, but not when I'm in a hurry.",

The soup is neither too salty nor greasy, with lentil, carrot, and some other veggies. I ordered fish soup for entr\u00e9e and I think it would be better if they can squeeze more lemon juice in it. The carafe and water glasses are not very clean though. But the bread is superb. My boyfriend ordered Lamb kidney for starter and Duck leg for entr\u00e9e, he said it was flavorless but I think they are okay. This cafe would be good for you if you are looking for some delicate food with light flavor, and also, if you have enough time since the waiting time is a little long than I have expected.",

Easily the best meal we had in London (yet nowhere near the most expensive). We hit some big name restaurants and none of the cooking was as spot on as Savoir Faire. The preparations were beautiful and delicious. Savoir Faire is a small, unpretentious, neighborhood restaurant. It is casual and comfortable, but the food is the epitome of French style. We had a very affordable bottle of Chateaudeuf-du-pape. I have to admit that I have forgotten after a almost a month away from home what we had for a starter. We both ordered chicken for dinner. It was moist and delicious with a wonderful array of vegetables, perfectly prepared. We shared a dessert. Everything was perfect.

A few friends and I came here after seeing how it was so highly reviewed on Yelp, and when we got to the restaurant we were surprised (but I guess happy) at how empty yet small it was. There was probably only one other table occupied, and a total of 7 tables in the room we were seated.The menu contained a lot of options, but I wanted something light so I ordered one of the vegetarian dishes. I can't remember what it's called, but it had mushrooms topped with mashed garbanzo beans/chickpeas and a side of broccoli and carrots. I'll admit that when the food first came out I was a bit skeptical since it's not the prettiest dish, but the first bite destroyed any doubt. The taste and texture of the mushroom paired with that of the garbanzo beans was amazing, and the broccoli/carrots were wonderfully cooked as well. I especially liked how the sauce was light and only used to enhance the taste (rather than drenching the food in sauce, which is kind of common nowadays in a lot of restaurants). After finishing I was well-satisfied and happy.Overall a great place to eat if you like authentic French food! I loved my experience here (food, service, and the super cute decor).",

The house wine was also good for the price.The scallops were perfectly cooked and paired well with the apples. The duck really shined - the skin was crispy and the meat was succulent and delicious. I also had the tarte tatin for desert, which was not overly sweet and paired with a very nice custard.The atmosphere was cozy and warm, and the prices were reasonable for the location. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I came here for a quick dinner before a show. It's puzzling to read all these rave reviews, which almost makes me wonder if we even dined at the same restaurant.I ordered the pre-theatre 2 course dinner with chicken liver pate (starter) and lamb moussaka with salad (main). The pate was good (3.5 stars) but the lamb moussaka was just ok (3 stars). For the price (\u00a315.90), it wasn't bad, but I just don't see why I want to come back here. My girlfriend ordered the special 2 course dinner (\u00a325.90) with traditional beef bourguignon. She was complete underwhelmed by the quality of the food. I'm sure she will give 2 stars or even 1.When it comes to the ambience, some may say intimate and romantic, but I thought it was cramped and grungy. We are not returning here for sure.*****************************If you found something useful in my review, please hit \"useful\" so that I can improve my reviews.

Service was slow but polite. The atmosphere was incredibly relaxing and it felt like one could stay at the table all night talking and unwinding. I got the braised lamb with stuffed mushrooms as a first course. The mushrooms were well seasoned and topped with a generous helping of herbs and goat cheese (double yum!). The lamb was cut into thick, juicy slices and resting on a bed of roast potatoes, steamed carrots and green beans, mashed potatoes, and ratatouille. Absolutely fabulous. Everything tasted amazing. The only incident was the small deep fried ball of meat that came on the side of my plate. I thought it looked like some sort of deep fried organ so I didn't eat it... I wonder if it landed on my plate by mistake during serving.",

They only had 2 meal menus, but since we were hungry, they allowed us to order extra starters.The food was excellent. From starters to desserts - pate, lamb kidneys, the sea bass, lamb and duck - each one perfectly cooked. And some of the best French fries that I've eaten in a very long time. They had some excellent wines and the whisky cheesecake was outstanding!Wish I had found this place before my mum and dad visited, would have loved to take them here on one of their many visits to the museum.",

The food is incredibly reasonable especially considering how amazing it all tastes! The staff was wonderful - they answered our questions happily and were very attentive. They even offered some suggestions of things to go on our trip to Paris. My husband and I shared some wine, French of course, and were pleased! For appetizers we had the goose rillete and \u00a0baked goat cheese - it was an amazing start to our meal. For dinner my husband had roast duck, which was perfectly cooked, and I had seared sea bass which was delicious! The skin had a crispness to it without drying out the fish. We ended the meal with cheesecake which honestly, was the best we've had! The texture was almost whipped it was so smooth and light. \u00a0Without a doubt I would recommend this restaurant. There is nothing about the experience that I could give lower than 5 stars to. If you ever find yourself in London, on or near Bloomsbury way, stop in for a bite. You won't regret it!",

    "text": "This tiny French cafe was a great choice during our stay in London. We were craving something fresh and yet still delicious. They have a pre-fix lunch menu with a salad and a meat option. The salad the day we visited was a roasted pear salad, it look so good but I wasn't hungry enough for multiple courses. I did end up with a salad though and so did another guest in my party. I ordered a butternut squash and goat cheese salad and it was perfectly dressed and a larger serving- I would recommend! The other salad ordered was a warm chicken and avocado salad- which was also very tasty and a large portion. We also had a steak and Brie sandwich on a fresh baguette- it was perfection. The bread was so fresh and soft yet the outside perfectly crispy. Everything we ordered was great and I would highly recommend this spot! The upstairs area is smaller and doesn't have air conditioning, which is fine normally but we were visiting on an 80 degree day- so just keep that in mind! The downstairs area is larger and cooler, but lacks the charm of the upstairs area, however this would be better for larger parties! Go here!",

    "text": "My friend and I had a late lunch here around 2:30 pm on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. We came from the British Museum, which was just a short walk away. It was fairly empty at the time, so we had our pick of indoor and outdoor seating; we picked a small table inside, right by a window, and got a nice view of the street and nearby buildings. There was also plenty of seating, as well as toilets, downstairs, although no one was sitting downstairs because it was so sunny outside (the downstairs area was quite dark but would probably be cozy in the evenings). We were greeted promptly by our server.Both of us ordered the butternut squash and goat cheese salad (my friend is a vegetarian). The food came out pretty quickly. I was pleased with how generous they were with the toppings; they had completely covered the greens with goat cheese, sliced nuts, and squash. The salad came with dressing on, but I'm sure you could ask for it on the side. It was really tasty; there might actually have been too much cheese, but as goat cheese is my favorite, I was pretty happy with it. The salads came with 1 basket of bread that we split; we wound up ordering more, since there wasn't that much in the 1st basket. The bread was accompanied by some seasoned olive oil, which also had sesame seeds in; it was pretty addicting for me as a bread lover. However, as it was a French restaurant, I was expecting the bread to be better; it was good, but I wasn't as blown away as I have been at some other French/Italian/Spanish restaurants.For dessert we split (well, I had 75% of it) a pear tarte tatin (when asked, the server informed us the dessert special of the day was mango sorbet). The tarte was a good size and really tasty; it was served warm. If my friend had been hungrier, I would've wanted to order 2 desserts, as the tarte wasn't really big enough to split equally between 2 people (although I have a big appetite so your mileage may vary).The restaurant had a great atmosphere and a nice view of the street. We were allowed to take our time and weren't bothered much by anyone throughout our leisurely meal. The facilities and tables were clean. The ceiling was decorated with some humorous sayings, so look up if you visit. Our meal came out to be about \u00a315/person, including 1 glass of wine, 1 dessert, and an extra basket of bread. I really enjoyed my lunch here and would happily return if I'm ever in the area again.",

It's served with oil for dipping.For dinner I ordered a mixed greens salad and the vegetarian tagine. The mixed greens (smallish) included frilly greens, a few slices of tomato and a creamy dressing. It was alright. The tagine was pretty good though. It included cooked carrots and apricots in a flavorful sauce with mint over couscous. I just wish there were a few more different veggies in there. My sister ordered the large vegetarian butternut squash and goat cheese green salad. It was super flavorful and the portion was generous. She also ordered the fries (chips), which were a little thinner than I normally like but not bad. I do like how there are several vegetarian options.Our waitress was pleasant and helpful. The decor is fun and nice. I enjoyed the quotes written on the ceiling.If I come back to London I would visit Savoir Faire again.",

The food came out quickly, however the waitress disappeared for a long time when we were dining and it took about 30 minutes longer to finally get our check.",

Although tasty enough, steaks were stringy and fatty. That lost a star from the review right there! I also felt that starters were lacking in portion size. Overall though, I did really enjoy myself, but that was probably due to the stellar company I was in! The ambience was pretty good in the restaurant, but d\u00e9cor was a little rough in places. Service was pretty slow and inattentive, but to be fair, this was possibly because we were tucked out of the way in the basement, like a pack of grouchy live-in mother-in-laws.

The ceasar salad was a staple and the stewed beef with mashed potatoes was perfectly savory. i LOVED!!!we got one bottle of wine for about 17 quid, and entire dinner cost about 65 quid (tip included) so really affordable and delivers great taste for the cash.The lowdown- there are two floors for dining: ground level and lower level. the restaurant is situated on a corner, so on the ground level you can do good people watching and have access to the bar. Lower level is cozy, dare I say romantic and the walls are adorned with oil murals of tasteful nudity and big mirrors here and there. - the bathrooms are cavernous and are truly tiny, but cute. To enter the women's restrooms there are literally 3 different doors. The only time i felt claustrophobic was in there.- there is NO music in the background. I didn't like that, and that is part of the reason why i took the 5th star out .- the crowd is diverse in terms of age, so don't expect to go there and find collegiates in mini skirts, but rather groups of people wanting to have a laid back conversation and a good time without having any use for background encouragement. - I suggest you go with your partner for a quiet night out, or with parents. not the place to go for loud fun.FOOD delicious!!! i will go back : ))",

You can't go wrong with the Boeuf Bourguignon or the Lamb Shank. Zey've added a fig appetiser which is worth trying. Every dish is tastefully executed and presented. Deserts not quite as good but if in addition zey had a patisserie chef zey'd have to raise ze price, so happy to keep it as it is. Done my best to make it clear zis review is coming from a Frenchman...",

    "text": "So we were at the British Museum and looked at Yelp for something close and this place had 4 stars with 90 reviews so we went and boy are we glad we did. \u00a0The foie gras was top notch and for dinner the beef borgunone (spell check does not work) was perfect with the fat rendered just right. \u00a0The duck was probably great for a non duck conniseure, but it is one of my favorite dishes so i judge harshly if not exactly right. \u00a0Overall the writing on the ceiling is entertaining and the atmosphere is laid back and comfortable, the staff were very polite and as you can see our experience is rated 5 stars.I definitely suggest trying this place, if we are in the area and in the mood for French we will be back, most likely the next time we are at the museum.",

    "text": "Perhaps one of the worst things about Yelp is the expectations. I was expecting a lot out of this place from all the reviews, so I brought my sister here. I can't seem to remember what she ordered, but I had the escargot and a lamb dish. Both were decent, but were really not that great. The lamb was too chewy and the escargot was also lacking some hit-the-spot Frenchy goodness. Nonetheless, it is nicely located in central London and has a nice restaurant setting. I guess you could give it a try if you're itchin' for French food within the area, but personally, I wouldn't itch to go back here again.I also might want to add how funny it was when my (also American) sister asked for a glass of iced tea. The response she received was a facial expression which read \"what the hell? ICED tea?!,\" which obviously came from the English waitress who couldn't understand why on earth one would want their tea ICE COLD. The lack of frigidity to my drinks was definitely something I had to get used to whilst living in London :)",

    "text": "We went there on the very strong recommendation from our hotel as \"the place to go\" before heading off to the theater. How right they were.First, the food. It was superbly prepared using obviously fresh ingrediants. Presentation was very nicely done. This is not some big chain establishment with a million things on the menu but a small, family run place that has a selection that is both authentic and just plain delicious. As mentioned, the restaurant is not some huge chain so reservations are in order. We had a small table with a setting that my wife and I would call romantic. This is the kind of place you go if you want an authentic bistro experience. We might not have gone in had we not known about it from the hotel but there is a reason they have a steady stream of regulars.As for the people, our service was top notch and very attentive. Max, the owner, spent time chatting with us. Leaving aside that he is fascinating in his own right, that he visited with us is and wanted to make sure they were meeting our expectations, which they far exceeded, is a reflection of how we found everyone there to be. Our server was especially helpful for our dinner selections and she was very attentive during the evening.I think it simple to sum up our experience. If you want a large chain menu and food, don't go here. If you want superb food with obviously hand picked fresh ingredients and expertly prepared dishes, don't go anywhere else. Max is terrific, the staff is terrific and our total experience was simply perfect. This unmistakably is a gem.",

The upstairs was very pleasant, and the downstairs looked like a cool place to hang out if you had a large group. Had some Pernod because it felt like the right thing to do. Will def go back but not really in a hurry. Booking via the OpenTable widget above was lovely.",

I can only speak for one dish on the menu, a dish that shall not be forgotten any time soon, the beef bourguignon. Truely a comforting experience, Heartily recommended.",
