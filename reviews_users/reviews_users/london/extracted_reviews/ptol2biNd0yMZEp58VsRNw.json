Ignore the polite hawkers on Brick Lane with their promise of free booze with your meal, and continue on your pilgrimage to one of the gems of the East (End of London). Muhib manages to separate itself from the crowd by having a delicious attitude toward spicing, which means that each dish tastes different from the next. For veggies, prepare to enjoy the most fantastic Paneer Shaslik - that's not on the menu by the way, you'll have to ask. While it's certainly not the cheapest restaurant on the strip, Muhib offers good quality, well made dishes in decent portion sizes and a conversation-friendly environment. I'd recommend brightly-lit Muhib for group meals as opposed to romantic dinners, and get dishes for sharing to enjoy diverse curry flavours. Price: roughly around \u00a320-\u00a325 per person",

    "text": "A friend and I decided to come in here on a Friday night when looking for a curry house on brick lane. Although we were a little torn between trying out one of the neighboring restaurants that were offering free wine and champagne, we decided to go with yelp recommendations, and we were glad we did. Muhib was pretty packed but they were able to sit us right away. The house red and white wine were 8.95 which was great if you are looking for somewhere cheap to eat and drink. We decided to share 4 veg dishes and had the popadom and dips to start. My oh my the dips were incredible, by far the best selection I have had in London. I have no idea what the different options were but all of them were tasty and incredible. By the time we got through those we were already full, but when the entrees came we managed to scarf those down as well. \u00a0We went with one of the lentil dishes which was good and incredibly garlicky, the alo gobi, which was a small portion but also good, the vegetable curry, which was also decent. The highlight of the meal was the vegetable korma which was incredible and I would go back solely for this dish. We ordered naan and mushroom rice to go with the veg dishes but really had wayyyyy to much food. All in all a tasty find on brick lane that I would definitely go back to, with more people, so that I don't feel physically ill upon departure.",

It was by far the worst visit ever.Before i even get to the food, the service was impeccably bad. We had a reservation at 9pm, but had to wait atleast 20minutes to be seated. Then to top it off, our orders took a whopping 45minutes to arrive - which is unacceptable.When the orders did arrive (after reminding the waiter about 2 times), there was the wrong curry served. We order for a balti curry, and they served us chicken tikka masala (which they made extremely spicy - not the kind of spicy that appeals to the palate and has a sophisticated blend of flavours, but simply a downpour of chilli powder). The chicken korma felt like a Tesco Chicken Korma with a huge amount of sugar (now i would prefer the Tesco one anyday). This could go on, and on...but in a nutshell, the worst experience with service and food. Have you lost the plot, Muhib?",

Decor: The restaurant has beautiful china ware, in a nice looking restaurant that is slowly showing its age (seats which were clearly expensive and custom made, are showing their age) is very pretty and made us feel like we were in a fancy indian restaurant. Service: our waiter was prompt, polite, helpful, and friendly. Entrance: they have a guy at the front who tries to woo you to come eat there (all the restaurants on Brick Lane have that person. This guy was the least 'pestering' of them all, but we should have negotiated more with him. We got one free round of drinks, we have heard of others getting that, a 20% discount, and a free entree. Perhaps at less busy times, or perhaps people who were less hungry. I didn't mind paying full pop for the food (minus the first round of drinks) as the service and food were so delicious. I would go back there every week, but regrettably I do not live in London. Note: Muhib is farther up Brick Lane than most of the Indian / Bengali restaurants, but I highly encourage you to pass the others by and give this place a try.",

Not as obtrusive as many of the places, even though they do have a barker out front trying to get folks in to dine, but so does every other place on Curry Lane. \u00a0Attractive china from Churchill's. Decor is silk tulips and old prints, but it's ok. Comfortable seating. \u00a0Music can be a little annoying, but you go there for their outstanding food. \u00a0 \u00a0 Papadum is very good...try it for an appetizer because the dipping sauces are a great complement, going from a sweet chutney to a spicy onion. Terrific curry dishes and the tikka masala is amazing, and they serve large portions. The naan was cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of spice. \u00a0Beer goes perfectly with the food, especially Kingfisher, the Budweiser of India.Good wait service and pleasant folks. They offered us a complimentary drink, but after the beer, we declined.All in all, a great place. Give it a try if you're looking for authentic Indian food.",

Using a taste card ( upto six people I think ) you get 50% on the full food menu apart from fri and Saturday. And yes I know some of you are thinking I don't like Indian or curry or even spicy food! They do goregous mild curries or even 'English' dishes ! But then again why would you be on brick lane looking for fish and chips! Food was served promptly and portion size was plentiful . You left with that feeling I could fit in an extra mouthful but then realise you would probably pop!Drinks are at London prices so you have been warned ! Just a quick word of warning ! You will find curry hustlers on the street - come on come in they will chant and claim there chicken tikka is from a recipe that came from the great Lord tikka himself and all this gubbins ( mancunion for rubbish ) Worth a trip out !",

    "text": "When you walk along Brick Lane picking an Indian restaurant can be daunting because there are soooooo many! Which one do we choose!? Well, luckily my lovely husband did his research and picked Muhib because when we have to make spontaneous decisions we're quite rubbish at it. We walked into Muhib around dinnertime on Sunday, maybe it was a little earlier because almost no one was there, but we've discovered that that doesn't really mean anything. We were seated and had a terrible time deciding what to eat because there were so many options! Don't worry that's not a bad thing. Our server was nice and helped us make a decision- we went with the Prawn Spread and Veggie Samosas, and the Fish Curry and Veggie Thali. I loved the Veggie Thali because there were so many options! And they all tasted great and different. I've also become a fan of the prawn spread. It's these prawns in a nice tomato-y tikka sauce over a fried bread. Very nice and flavourful. They also have paratha which we had a go at but it's nothing terribly special- I'd go with the naan instead. The servers weren't very talkative and didn't really smile, but they were still really nice and helpful!",

    "text": "Came here while on vacation in London. Every restaurant on Brick Lane looked similar, but this one had the friendliest door man so we came inside. Food was absolutely amazing. So good that during our week long visit we came here twice. The second time we visited the waiter and door man both remembered our names, where we were from, and the meal we most enjoyed during our first visit. Granted both trips here were within 4 days of each other, but considering the large volume of clients this venue encounters I was genuinely surprised by their ability to recall such detail. It felt like you were dining in with close friends. Everyone was so warm and welcoming. And did I mention the food?! Hands down our favorite meal we had while in England. I strongly recommend.",

    "text": "Great Indian food on the infamous Brick Lane. I found Muhib primarily on Yelp, which was incredibly helpful because of the overwhelming nature of Brick Lane: curry hustlers, flashing lights, an onslaught of aromas. Which to choose? Interior (as most places on Brick Lane) is faux upscale. Cheesy in a polyester kind of way, but cheap and cheerful nonetheless. We went with the chicken tikka masala, lamb curry and garlic naan. Fresh flavours although probably a tad on the sweeter side for my liking. Still really, really enjoyed it. One small downer was the service - on the slow side. Took a long time for the food to arrive. On the upside, the wine was on the order of 3 pounds a glass. Thus began a night that ended at a diner at 4am. Thank you, Muhib.",

The haggling that goes on the streets at just about every restaurant is silly but it was agrred that we would try this restaurant. I am glad we did. Our drink order was taken and we ordered simosa, butter chicken and their house special balti with lamb. The food took a little extra time but it was worth it. The food here is incredible and it would be my siggestion to try the house special balti. It was heavenly!The service here was very good and I half to day that this was the best Indian Restaurant I have been to in years. I am impressed.",

    "text": "Came on recommendation of a friend. Waiters were friendly. Excited to see thaali on the menu along with chaat.Unfortunately, the sauces served with papadums were full of emulsifiers (ingredients that thicken and foods quickly, creating more volume and mouth feel), which I'm allergic to. They make me swell up. Not the restaurant's fault, but when you have a lot of emulsifiers, it means you're cutting corners on ingredients or using bottled sauces. The chaat was served hot, instead of cold with rice chips as traditional. The thaali was decent, but the basmati rice tasted stale and there were artificially colored rice in the mix. The raita was missing cucumber. While there's always regional variations in Indian food, the food just seemed too processed. If you have food sensitivities or are looking for Indian food like your friend's mother cooks, keep looking.",

    "text": "With a week in London and a pretty insane amount of Indian food on Brick Lane alone, the fact that I spent one of those meals going back to Muhib a second time says a lot about how good it is. The lamb vindaloo here is for real- not punishing, but flavorful and just hot enough to be sweaty by the end. Prices are pretty reasonable, not the cheapest in town but certainly not the worst either. Service can be super slow and a little deadpan, but it honestly beats the more intense guys hawking the other restaurants on the block.As a curry junkie utterly spoiled by the wealth of good Indian food back home, I didn't know if London curry would be as good as what I can get delivered to my house. This is definitely on the itinerary for my next visit!",

As one of previous reviews describes (which I haven't read before entering the restaurant), the dishes are very sweet, which is a strange concept for Indian food, isn't it? Also, an extensive choice of so many different dishes from almost all corners of Asia is suspicious too.Service is extremely polite though.",
