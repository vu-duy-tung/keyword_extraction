From the moment you set foot inside the building, you know you are in for a good night - whether you are going for a full on experience in the restaurant, or are just hanging with a drink in the bar.. this is not a place to get disappointed. It is possible to order meals in the bar too, from fresh salads to the flakiest cod. The menu get small daily tweaks, so you know the produce is as fresh as can be. And oh, the drinks are sublime too.",

    "text": "I have a couple of problems with Clove Club. \u00a0Actually, only one of those problems is specific to Clove Club and the other is with restaurants like this in general. \u00a0CC doesn't seem to know if it should be fine dining or casual and the whole contrast is very jarring and comes off as pretentious. \u00a0Secondly, I am so bored with 'tasting menus'. \u00a0I can understand if you are the Fat Duck why you'd have a tasting menu, there is a lot of technique to show experience and showcase. \u00a0But here you are served fried chicken, it might be dressed up in a Christmas tree but it's still just fried chicken. \u00a0The menu here should definitely be a la carte and it should be casual because that is the food that is served. \u00a0Its sister restaurant 10 Bells is exactly this and it is wonderful and I love it. \u00a0CC on the other hand is trying to be something it is not.Re: the food, it was good but a little bit boring. \u00a0They do change their menu regularly so the descriptions below may not be around when you visit.The good dishes we had on the day were: \u00a0the fried chicken (although you only get one piece per person. \u00a0It's the same chicken at 10 Bells except you get a lot more to enjoy), pigeon sausages (wonderfully seasoned and gamey), 20 day dry aged Challans Duck (perfectly cooked, skin crispy and the flesh soft and tender), Amalfi lemonade (the sourness was quite the shock and then you get to the sweetness and it was like a party in your mouth) and the blackcurrant leaf icecream (intense and a perfect end to the meal). \u00a0There were some very forgettable dishes too like the smoked roe, beetroot & yoghurt (this tasted like any kind of canapes you'd get from M&S - which is solid but why served in a place like CC), tuna tartare (completely not enough dressing), thornback ray (plain and nothing to recommend it).And everything came out so slowly. \u00a0We were well and truly bored by the end. \u00a0It felt like the food kept coming with nothing to remember it by.",

    "text": "I don't usually like being the bearer of bad reviews, but I thought my experience was important to share for others who might be likeminded.TL;DR: I left hungry.My friend and I had a reservation for the bar, and ordered:Cocktails: Japanese whiskey thing was refreshing, and maybe my favorite part of the experience but nothing to return for. Pisco Inferno was delightfully named but confusingly flavored, as my friend didn't get anything pisco-y from it.Bread and butter: Would have been fantastic if not seemingly baked from frozen--the bread was warm on the outside, but cold and wet in the middle. The texture was actually perfect for me, up until I hit the clammy parts. It was upsetting.Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Pine Salt: Tasty, but I was distracted by the set-up being an overabundance of pine nesting that made me wonder if they throw the nest away every time, or if the nest had been reused. Neither thought made me happy.Raw Orkney Scallop, Hazelnut, Clementine & Wiltshire Truffle: I usually love raw scallop, but I didn't love this combination at all. There was something weird about the textures that reminded me of slivered styrofoam and brined slime. This was a personal preference, as it really worked for my companion.Roast Cornish Cod, Borlotti Beans, Smoked Garlic & Tarragon: The only thing I remember about this is that I let my friend have most of it because it didn't really do it for me. I wasn't being terribly gracious, as there wasn't a lot to share anyway.Clove Club Salad with Radishes: Definitely the best-executed food we had, mostly because the lettuces were super fresh.Smoked Kielbasa & Sweet Pickle Mustard: They forgot to bring it out, but didn't forget to put it on the bill. The servers apologized, but I wish they had just remembered to bring it when we wanted it.I really do wish Clove Club the best, as I see they have made many of my friends so happy. But I can't recommend it based off this experience, unless you really crave a side salad with a refreshing cocktail, in which case by all means, it's got your number.",

From there the experience started...Chose the wine pairings and then within just a minute or two our dishes started to arrive. Everything was interesting and exciting and innovative but at the same time not overly fussy or silly. A stream of flavours, textures and combinations designed to please the senses and it all worked. A standout was the raw scallop with brown butter and truffle. There were some quirky dishes such as duck and ginger broth with 100 year old madeira (you drink the broth and then sip the madeira). The wine pairing option was quite a bit more but a real treat and each dish had a wine option so I think I tried about 10 different wines, including dessert wines. Everything was highly coordinated in timing and perfectly executed with the chefs in the kitchen on show and working together in a focused manner.Different from a classic Michelin restaurant experience and maybe more exciting. The restaurant itself is in a low key, almost minimal interior but warm, not cold. Service was superb. Low key, friendly, just on point.In terms of value, I also give 5 stars. Pricey yes but excellent all round so good value.I want to go back if I can get a reservation again!",

    "text": "Amazing food, amazing service, amazing drinks. In short, this place is amazing, and you need to go here.Located in the bustling and uber-cool Shoreditch neighborhood, it's your best bet to make a reservation and show up on time. I was lucky enough to come here with a local who knew best how to navigate the menu of multiple small plates, and among the four of us in our party, we shared just about every plate on the menu, in addition to a few cocktails and a great bottle of wine. The Clove Club really shines when it comes to meat and cheeses; their charcuterie is simply not to be missed. The care and thoughtfulness that goes into combinations and presentation is very apparent and much appreciated, too. Another thing you're going to want to try? The fried chicken -- it's simply sublime. Our servers were incredibly sweet and helpful when it came to making recommendations not only for what to order, but how much of what to order. I think they enjoyed us enjoying them, because on top of the two desserts we ordered, they gifted us a third because they 'though we might enjoy this, too.\" Such service!While the vibe is on the hipstery side of things, the mood is anything but and the food, cocktails and service give this place the clout to do whatever the cripes they want with their decorative choices. I, for one, will be returning here immediately upon landing in London whenever that next happens... And it will happen, I can assure you.",

I hate using the metaphor \"journey\", but from the first bite of the delicious pre-menu snacks, that's exactly what it felt like; A journey through the English countryside.

The Flame Grilled Mackerel (with English cucumber, elderflower and sorrel), the Duck Broth & Hundred Year Old Madeira, the Yorkshire Grouse (with elderflower and golden turnip) and last, but not least, the Amalfi Lemonade & Sarawak Pepper dessert. Damn, that was good! I will for sure return here next time I'm in London. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Was blown away by this place on Thursday evening. The first thing you notice is the venue itself. Set in the heart of Shoreditch in what seems to be an unassuming grey ex governmental building from the outside. You immediately walk into a view of dried meats and a buzzing but equally laid back bar and smiles from all the staff. The restaurant is located at the back and with its huge old windows was perfect for a hot summers evening.The staff were attentive but non intrusive and exceptiinally friendly and our particular waitress had great knowledge of all the courses and wines and helped us make an excellent choice on drinks.The menu itself is a set tasting menu of \u00a355 with supplements for some extra courses. Before the meal you are given some amazing bite size snacks. Despite their size, each set off a taste explosion in your mouth.This was then followed by 8 (ish) courses of sheer culinary brilliance. Everything was delicious and impossible not to savour. A particular favourite was the aubergine puree served with one of the courses. In addition the bread and butter side is made there and even the butter was delish!This meal was finished off with two separate desserts and when the bill came this was served again with further smaller and equally stunning desserts. \u00a0It would be impossible not to leave this place 100% sated. A London must do!",

The latest venue of the \"Young Turks\" impresses in ways, not least of which is their addictive and delicious Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Pine... a dish that I could see myself coming back for again and again (think: the best Popcorn Chicken you have ever eaten). Other dishes were generally strong as well: Pigeon Sausages, Chicory Salad, and the Beef Short Rib main (with a delicious schmear of mashed potato) all stood out. While some of the tapas from the \"Cold\" section did not particularly impress, I would be quick to point out that everything was more than edible... and we left our plates almost uniformly clean.Service from start to finish was very good. A last minute change of our reservation from 4 to 2? No problem. I also appreciated that the wait staff all seemed very into food... and all had insightful opinions on the menu. The only miscue was with regards to wine recommendations: our Bourgonge Rouge was not close to impressive, albeit drinkable.",

    "text": "Since moving to London, my mother really likes to find out about new and interesting restaurants for me to try. The last time I was home, she had printed out something from the internet about the five best restaurants in Shoreditch. I had to roll my eyes, because Shoreditch is that place I love to hate. It's so trendy, it's not even funny. And usually things seem to be too trendy for their own good and ultimately aren't really as good as they think they are or that the hipsters think they are. However, I was curious (and I have been to a few decent places in Shoreditch), so I glanced over the list. The Clove Club really jumped out at me because they mentioned \"de-boned puffed chicken feet\", and I immediately knew that this was going at the top of my list of restaurants to try when I finished my vacation.Well, due to Nava N.'s imminent return to London for a few weeks, I convinced her (and her beau) to come to dinner to give it a try. Checking their website they offer a five-course tasting menu for \u00a355, but if you pre-order, you can go whole hog and pre-order a nine-course menu for \u00a385. So yeah, nine courses it would have to be, so I sent them an email to set up this experience! The menu had no mention of the chicken feet, so I was a bit disappointed, but I'm aware that places change menus so I shouldn't be too bothered that the course is missing.The venue itself is really simple and modern. Not elaborate, but really well done. There's a bar area (where we sat and enjoyed some really delicious cocktails to start the dinner) and a dining area with a few tables and a big open kitchen. We were sitting on the other side of the room, so I didn't have a great view of the kitchen, but I did get to glance that way a few times to see the chefs bustling around the kitchen.So the tasting menu starts out with snacks. Apparently snacks are the new \"in thing\" for tasting menus. Not that I mind. There were a lot of snacks to be had. The first of which: THE CHICKEN FEET. It really made my night to know that I was going to eat the dish that convinced me to try the restaurant in the first place. Oh yes, the chicken feet. And it was really delicious. Like crackling (but chickeny). The came a selection of house-cured meats, a peanut and mint roll and a cracker with a fishy cream on top. All were delicious. Then came out pine fried chicken, tarts with a hazelnut oil and mini cheese sandwiches. The chicken was perfectly cook (and moist thanks to the use of thighs). The cheese sandwiches were heavenly with a slightly chilled bechamel between two light and crispy crackers. Finally we had sausage with a green ketchup that was a just a burst of flavors in your mouth. What a great way to start the meal!This was followed by mullet sashimi (though the American guy bringing it to our table called it mackerel, so who knows). Light and delicate and you can't go wrong with daikon radishes. Next was a potato soup with cockles and beans. Really light potato soup! I didn't know it could get so creamy and yet so light! Then my favorite course of the night: the squid. It was cooked perfectly with an amazing indian spiced sauce. One of the best squid courses I've eaten. The following course of turbot was also really well done (and I usually don't like fish unless it's seafood), and the elderflower and fennel puree was delicious. Next was a cheddar tart (where the cheddar just oozed out of the shell). Really good. Then a duck broth with 100 year old madeira. Nice, but the madeira was hard to taste over the broth. Then we had a black pudding dish with peach (although they said it was lowquat), and we all enjoyed it quite a bit. The last savory course was duck with seeds and grains, and while I really enjoyed the duck, I wasn't a fan of spelt risotto (I never am, I think it's a texture thing). The flavor of the spelt was nice, but I just couldn't finish it.The two desserts both consisted of ice cream, and they were both really delicious. The first was a Pepper Ice Cream with a lemon cream on top. The pepper was really subtle and hard to taste, but I could have eaten that lemon all night. The final one was black current leaf ice cream with a black current jelly, and it was a perfect end to the main courses. At this point, it was getting late, so we had to get the bill and get rushed out, so I didn't get to try the coffee. But they did deliver three petit fours at the end of the meal for us to try. One was a little cake that was heavenly. The second was an almond and coffee chocolate bar. The almond was really subtle, but the coffee was really in your face. I loved it. Finally a candy with a liquid center made of fernet and creme de menthe. It just finished up with a lovely burst of mint to end the meal.Unfortunately, they don't do wine pairings, which was a bit of a let down, but I had my partner figure out some good wines to go with the meal. I can't recommend The Clove Club enough! We'll definitely be back in the future.",

    "text": "Now that I've had two visits to the Clove Club, I feel like I can give a more holistic review. To be fair, my first visit started out with a bit of bickering between me and my partner over why I booked the bar area for 8PM on a Tuesday rather than wait for the 9:30 reservation for the set menu in the dining room. My argument is that it would be a long dinner to be enjoyed without worrying about rushing home (more on that later). All resentment faded away when we realized we were literally sitting next to Kiera Knightly in the back room of the bar. So there was that. \u00a0The pros of the night were getting drunk on delicious cocktails \u00a0(I mean it's a Tuesday, but now we're sitting next to Kiera Knighly - so why not celebrate and send a couple shots to her table as well - yes that happened .)The cons were...well, sitting next to Kiera Knightly - so the staff was pretty indisposed and starstruck and focused on making sure everything (literally everything) on the menu was delivered to her table while we waited ages for the dishes we ordered. I think we had about 4 waiters through the night as they could come over to us and drop food and get a glance over to the table. So much for consistency, right? That being said when we did have a chance to interact, everyone wa nice and chatty. \u00a0So, I suppose you might be wondering about the food. \u00a0If you go for the bar menu, don't miss out on the buttermilk fried chicken. You'll also find this on your snacklist on the set tasting menu if you decide to come back and try that. \u00a0The buttermilk was by far the best dish that we tried at this sitting.My second visit is where I think I can give an actual review. My girlfriends and I have a monthly wine club and to celebrate the Holidays and relieve us of our hosting duties, we decided to do a wine and food pairing at the Clove Club. \u00a0I need to mention that we didn't provide any dietary restrictions in advance and there is a set menu. \u00a0One of my friends has a deathly shellfish allergy and we realized upon arriving that a few of the dishes in the set menu had shellfish. \u00a0Without having to say much the staff was super accommodating. Wine pairings: Do it. And if it's a celebration - start with the prosecco. The prosecco they had available was organic and \"cloudy\" and though not you would traditionally imagine when you think prosecco - a delight. \u00a0The sommelier knew his stuff and it really added to the experience to have him pop over for each dish and explain the pairings (plus if the kitchen is going a bit slow - he will make sure you always have a full glass to taste with!) We left with a wine list in hand for future wine club inspiration. \u00a0Food: As I mentioned you'll get to try the buttermilk fried chicken as part of the snacks here. \u00a0As for the other food. So - great! My favourites include the scallop and venison but there really wasn't one bad course. \u00a0I'd suggest making reservations pretty far in advance if you're looking to dine in the set menu restaurant, though the bar seems to have more accommodating seatings at the last minute.",

    "text": "I can't agree with the previous reviewer who suggested that fine dining in a casual setting came off as pretentious. It's true the setting is casual / down to earth and the food is top notch, but I didn't get the impression they were glaringly try-too-hard or attempting to pull off a fake overpriced hipster chic. Rustic wood floors & tables, open kitchen and hanging hams fit with a laidback Shoreditch vibe, and the area perhaps doesn't lead you to expect a lot of michelin-quality food options. Perhaps if the clientele had been City suits from a couple of miles down the road you would have looked at the decor and pricing more cynically as if it were just the latest 'new alternative' place to separate you from your cash. But most of the guests seemed to be couples or good friends having a fun time without being too formal or too raucous. Didn't spend any time in the bar as we had quite early reservations on a Friday evening, and it filled up relatively quite quickly between 6.30 and 7. Staff did a good job; while it was less busy some of them were standing around a little awkwardly but not in your face. The \u00a355 per head tasting menu (5 courses plus some snacks and other titbits) was good value, although by the time you add on a round of cocktails, some inhouse cured meats, pay the supplementals for an excellent optional course, have coffee and a couple of bottles of excellent wine - you can triple that, pre tip (12.5%, auto-added).So, not the kind of place you go every week or every month, and with so many other fine dining choices in London I've yet to try, I'm unlikely to be back for a while. But I'd recommend it and give 4.5 stars if that were an option. As it isn't, I can't justify 5* so will have to just say 4.",

To begin with there are 4-5 cocktails that are pretty fantastic (in our party we tried four and they were all good). Then there are small starters that include salami, cheese, and some yummy radishes. The real piece de resistance however was the buttermilk fried chicken. Trust me you will want the basket all to yourself. The sole was great too, with an Indian twist. Finally the fennel mousse for dessert is certainly not the most delicious thing I've ever tried but the combination is interesting and worth trying out. Atmosphere was very trendy and extremely friendly and efficient staff.",

We chose to have the wine pairing with our tasting menu and it was perfect. The service was flawless and the staff was extremely knowledgable and helpful.After visiting Alinea // Chicago several weeks prior to The Clove Club, I found myself asking how The Clove Club will live up to it. In a nutshell, it was a close second to Alinea. Even though The Clove Club had the best dish I've ever experienced, the service fell just a little bit short of Alinea. Overall I cannot wait to visit the clove club again!

    "text": "I came here for dinner with two friends last night after booking a few weeks prior. As is widely known, The Clove Club requires advance payment when booking, which is very unique, but some other things I noticed were that 1) it was very hard to know when dates would open to be available for \u00a0booking, as the site just says the end date that it is booking until, so it was only through consistent checking of the site that I booked at the very start of October for a November date 2) I did not think about the fact that there will be gratuity added later, so you will have some additional amount to pay, regardless of whether or not you get drinks / supplements and 3) you can upgrade to the full 9 course menu when you get there, so that is not a problem. The venue is very cool, as it is part of Shoreditch Town Hall, but there is a separate entrance that is well marked so finding it was not a problem. We have a large comfortable table in a quiet corner, but the bar was quite loud and the seats didn't look very comfortable, so I am glad we did not book for that area. The other remarkable thing I noted was that it was a very casual vibe for a Michelin star restaurants; our corner was decorated as if it was a living room, and there were rustic wooden tables and no white tablecloths. I loved it! We had the five course set menu, which was predominantly seafood based, but also came with several courses of amuse bouches and petit fours, so it ended up being a lot of food that took us over 2 hours to finish. I also thought it was very interesting that each course was presented by a different person, which made me think that it may be the responsible chef in the kitchen. The most memorable dishes was an amuse bouche with crab and hollandaise, the smoked mallard that was presented to us in its entirety at the table before being plated and the tarte tatin that was simply incredible. We also got the \u00a350 egg yolk with white Alba truffle supplement to share, and while the truffle servings were extremely generous, I didn't think it was worth the price. The sommelier was very helpful and recommended a white wine from the southwest of Italy that we really liked. I would definitely recommend the experience!",

    "text": "Heard a lot of good things about The Clove Club and I took two foodie friends from out of town there and this place didn't disappoint! We had a wonderful evening tasting delicious food and enjoying great services which were not typical of London restaurants. The restaurant only serves a 5-course tasting menu, and based on previous reviews, the price has increased to \u00a355 (from \u00a347 April 2013). However, it is still great value for the high quality and innovative food on the table. The dining room was intimate and you can see the open kitchen at one end of the room. As soon as we were lead into the dining room, people behind the kitchen greeted us. They were so nice and warm and I feel that they were really happy that we came to dine tonight. Before the tasting started, there were 3 pre-courses, which included the famous buttermilk fried chicken & pine salt, pieces of juicy deliciousness with fresh pine salt, simply heaven. We also ordered their house cured Jamon for an extra \u00a316. It was good, but I have tasted better. The tasting started with horse mackerel tartare covered in picked rhubarb & turnips. The presentation was so pretty and the taste was extremely refreshing and delicate. A very strong opening. Then followed Cornish monkfish with white asparagus, cinnamon and curry leaf. I love how the warm and sweet flavor of cinnamon compliment the taste of monkfish. The heaviest dish was lamb with seaweed sauce. It was quite an unusual combination. Both have very distinctive flavors and I would never have dreamed of putting the two together. However, it worked beautifully together, and I especially loved the fatty part of the lamb, so very delicious. Then we were transitioning to the sweet part of the evening which took the meal to a new height. The warm blood orange, sheep's milk mousse and fennel granita was divine! The palate cleanser which was not even listed on the menu turned out to be another highlight. It was a lemon soda mousse, which was fluffy and tingled on your tough. We all loved it. Last but not least, we had apple tarte tatin. And in typical tasting menu fashion, we got some last sweet treats of house made chocolate. We thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience and it is definitely high on my recommendation list.",

It's not a huge wine list, but there's a good variety.To start:- Beet root and apple granita with walnut cream: the cream was definitely nutty and interesting- Cornish crab tart with crab hollandaise: the spices reminded me of Old Bay and were good with crab- Buttermilk fried chicken and haggis buns: the haggis buns had a good spiced onion flavor. This dish is actually at In Situ in SF right now. This was my favorite of the amuses even though I don't usually like haggis The meal:- Red Cornish mullet sashimi: with thinly sliced black radish and tarragon - Raw scallop (signature dish): I thought that texture and flavor wise, the scallop could have used a bit more. The hazelnut and toasted hazelnut actually obscured the sweetness of the scallop - Chestnut and oyster broth: served like a chawanmushi - it was like a creamy spinach and seafood chowder. This was very warming and satisfying, and the Scottish seaweed was very unique - Monkfish: cooked in malted barley oil with Jerusalem artichoke and coffee- Buckwheat pancake: I liked being able to pick it up with my hand. It had chicken, a long pepper, a mustard leaf, and devil's spices (similar to what was on the crab) - Madeira from 1908 - you first get to taste it on its own, and then they pour in warm duck consomm\u00e9 with fermented cabbage. The consomm\u00e9 was rich but clean and had a nice hint of thyme- Fallow prickett: a bit gamey for me. The Szechuan pepper and black currant made it very interesting, though- Yorkshire grouse (add on supplement): we didn't expect for it to be quite so gamey, and we actually had a comment from one of the servers that was kind of like \"well what did you expect?\", which was very off-putting. The elderberries and bread sauce were enjoyable To finish:- Amalfi lemonade and an Appalachian ice cream: the lemon was very clean tasting, which I appreciated- Jelly of champagne and summer berries: I don't usually like fruit based desserts, but this was good for the end of the meal- Islay whisky gel caramels: alcoholic bonbons with a fragile shell and liquid insideI think everything in concept was very creative and interesting, but the execution wasn't quite what I was expecting or hoping for on some of the dishes. \u00a0I do enjoy feeling like you're sitting in the kitchen and being able to see the chefs in action. \u00a0The meal ended up taking about 5 hours. I appreciate that we were never rushed, but it did last a while. \u00a0The price was quite reasonable for what we got, and the sommelier was great.",

Since opening earlier this year, the Clove Club has been getting quite a bit of hype among London's foodie scene, and for once the hype is well-deserved.For \u00a347 quid you get an fantastic and semi-reasonably priced tasting menu. Some of the dishes were simply amazing---mackerel tartare I'm looking at you. My friends raved about the fried buttermilk chicken. The pan grilled red mullet was also well presented and rather tasty. The only dish that was just ok was the roast barbary duck--a bit bland, but every other dish was a culinary work of art.Service was friendly and helpful with the wine selections (we opted for bottles instead of the \u00a340 wine pairing) as well as accommodating dietary restrictions. The tasting menu was easily adapted to for lactose intolerance---even down to the diary free chocolates at the end!All in, the Clove Club is such a great spot. Definitely worth checking out. If you can't get a reservation for the main dining room, the front bar serves more casual food for walk-ins.",

For me, the highlight was snacks to start off including fried chicken with pine dust, home made bread (absolutely delicious) with homemade butter, and lightly flamed mackerel... The rest of the meal was not bad but not great for my taste - everything was in good quality though. \u00a0 Service was friendly - really enjoyed the evening.",

    "text": "We dined at The Clove Club on our last night in London and the first night they used the ticketing system. We were really excited to do the extended tasting menu and to try out this highly rated restaurant - part of the Worlds 50 Best List - 66 on the list. We started with a series of different snacks from the kitchen. All were absolutely amazing. I would say the best was their house cured meats or the buttermilk fried chicken with pine salt that everyone talks about. We were lead through a series of dishes, that range in size. Some of the tasting dishes were quite smaller than we expected (cheese tartlet with malt; duck and ginger broth) but still packed amazing flavor. Some of the dishes were really delicious, well seasoned, prepared and composed. We loved the raw scallop with clementines and oysters; slow cooked lamb with spring onion and mutton; or the \u00a0chilled pea mousse (amazing!!!). Some of the dishes were good but not great though - the pollack with curry leaves was a little over cooked and the foam wasn't needed, and the desserts were good but not amazing. We dined at the Ledbury the night before, who also had a fresh strawberry tartlet, and the quality of the strawberries and the dessert itself didnt even compare with the Ledbury. Overally it was a really great and fun night. The atmosphere was casual but still intimate enough for a date or personal event. It is also fun to watch the kitchen at work. I wish Chef Issac was a little more personable and talked to us or some other tables though; but on the contrary to that, every dish we had was brought out to us by a kitchen staff and explained thoroughly. In addition the wine selection is extremely reasonable and the cocktails are amazing!",

We booked the restaurant months in advance through their reservation system which required payment upfront. It was a little terrifying but there was no way we were going to miss this meal. We decided to go with the five course dinner menu at 65 pounds. I didn't expect five courses at a fancy restaurant to be filling but my stomach felt like it was going to explode by the third course. The restaurant had a very simplistic look to it. The service was top notch. The food was delicious! Quality and execution was spot on. We tried an assortment of things and it was all really well done. All the flavors worked together and everything on the plate had a purpose, even the smallest sauce on the side added to the dish. Their infamous fried chicken had great seasoning, with tender chicken on the inside, a good crunch on the outside. Their monkfish was deliciously soft. The potato soup was super creamy. A wonderful, fancy experience!",

    "text": "I am no culinary aficionado and don't eat at places like the Clove Club except for 'once in a lifetime/extremely special' events. But I do like food and I like good food even more. On our vacation through Europe, my wife and I had selected two high-end restaurants to eat at - one in Paris and the other being the Clove Club. The Paris one was highly rated with plenty of articles saying it was the hottest place in town. We'd left pretty disappointed and so walked into The Clove Club with low expectations. As you can see by my 5-star review, we were blown away.Walking in the door, I believe we were greeted by every member of the staff. There may have been a dishwasher that escaped us, but the committee was in full force. After being seated and getting our water, we were given options on beverages to get us started. I wish I remembered what we ordered, but both were non-alcoholic with mine being a sort of limeade/tea and my wife's being a smoked lemonade. After walking all day around London, they were both refreshing, with mine being quite delicious. We also chose to do the 'soft drink pairing' which was \u00a330 per person (which I don't think was listed anywhere, but much cheaper than the other pairings offered).Before I start talking about the food itself, let me talk about the staff. We had no less than 6 different people that 'served' us throughout the evening. Each one was very friendly, but our main server - a petite Italian lady - was one of the best servers I've had anywhere. We were able to strike up small conversations with the staff throughout the evening and they were great at being just normal human beings.The food was a parade of individual delights. They say it's a 9-course tasting menu, but that doesn't count the \"selection of snacks to start\". I'll outline them individually, so if you don't want to have the surprise spoiled, skip to the end.-=[ Snacks ]=-A. Frozen gazpacho - Not the official name and there was more to it, but we kicked off the evening with a food slushee. \u00a0Round 1 and we already were impressed. The gazpacho was very flavorful and was balanced with a cream that I unfortunately don't really remember the flavor of.B. Crab tart with hollandaise sauce - I'm not a huge crab fan, but these were delicious. \u00a0Maybe the hollandaise and seasonings worked their magic on my tongue. Well balanced flavors and a perfect texture combination.C. Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Pine Salt (Fancy Chicken Nuggets) - Reading other reviews, people are knocking these bad boys. Ignore those food snobs - just because something categorically similar can be found at McDonald's doesn't mean they can't be enjoyed. And enjoy we did. These are not shredded chicken dunked in fry batter and then bathed in a vat of hot oil. You get a solid chunk of actual chicken flavored in a way that makes you feel like a kid again. And yes - they're as succulent as you could hope for.D. \u00a0Battered meat balls - I only vaguely remember these, but my wife said they were meat in a corn-dog style batter, in a spherical shape. Another twist on a childhood memory.-=[ Main Courses ]=-1. Hay smoked wild Scottish sea trout, jersey royal potato, and Sansho - Basically ground trout tartare in a cream sauce with straw fries for texture. I was a little nervous as it looked like raw fish. \u00a0I've had sashimi and lightly smoked salmon, but I'm not really big on it. Silly me. This was really good. The trout was flavorful, the creamy sauce appropriately rich, and the potato added a nice crunchy element.2. Raw Orkney scallop, hazelnut, clementine, and Manjimup truffle - This was my least favorite dish, but my wife's favorite. That said, I still enjoyed it. The slimy scallops dominated the texture, but that IS the nature of scallops. The fungi were pleasant and the overall flavor was still good. Scallop lovers won't be disappointed.3. Chilled soup of Courgette (zucchini), Chrysanthemum, and smoked ham - This was my wife's least favorite, though I really liked it. Again, she still enjoyed it though, it was just low on the ranking. You drink this like a tea. The presentation was striking and mine actually got prettier as I sipped it. (Who have I become that I call food pretty!??!)4. Baked Dover sole, green peppercorn hollandaise, and spinach - My biggest regret here is that the dish isn't served as a standalone meal, large enough to indulge in for an evening with extra to eat later. WOW. Simply delicious. Even the spinach was great. \u00a0:)5. Hot smoked lamb ribs, mint and seaweed jelly - My wife does not like lamb. Mark this as the first time she's liked it. The flavor was not pungent like lamb can sometimes be. I'd say it was comparable to some great Kansas City barbecue in texture.I'm getting a character limit warning on Yelp. The rest will be up to you to enjoy. I was simply so impressed that I wanted to share the entire experience. The Clove Club is a once-in-a-lifetime experience (for us) and worth the adventure. \u00a0Plan for 3 hours!",

    "text": "While researching for a trip to London, I came across a list of The World's 50 Best Restaurants and saw that The Clove Club was ranked #26. Upon further investigation, I also found that it earned a michelin star and was ranked #1 in London. Needless to say, I was sold. I made a reservation for lunch and settled on the 9 course tasting \u00a0menu for \u00a3110. While I normally don't spend that much on a meal, I figured it would be worth it for the 26th best restaurant in the world. By the end I wished I had saved the money and put it towards some other part of our trip. We spent 3 hours here, which was a nice break from sight seeing, and while the staff here was very friendly and the services was great, the food didn't impress me like I hoped it would. Overall the flavors were not as unique and mind-blowing as I had been lead to believe based off of other reviews. While some dishes like the suckling pig belly and 100 day old Lincolnshire chicken were great, others were just OK or a miss. With a rating like #26 in the world, I expected each one great. In my opinion, try if you want to say you've been here, but otherwise save your money and use it elsewhere. BTW, anyone else wondering why specifically 100 days for the chicken? Would anyone really notice the difference if it were 101 or 102?",

    "text": "Made reservations to Clove Club a few weeks prior to our trip to London. Reservations were fairly easy on their website, and what's best (or at least in my opinion) is that you can choose ahead of time what kind of dining experience you're looking to have: Just drinks, a la carte, tasting, etc. My fianc\u00e9 and I chose the tasting menu, the only catch or plus (whichever way you see it) was you had to pay for your meal upon booking. To be honest it's the same as placing a deposit for your reservation. I don't know about you but, paying ahead of time instead of seeing a gi-normous dinner bill, psychologically hurts my funds a little less. But let's move on to the experience! We were running a little late (past 15 mins) to our reservation, so we had called ahead of time to let them know. (Their policy honors a reservation up to 15mins of the booking time). The person on the receiving end didn't seem to mind, and when we got there, we were immediately seated. The dining hall was modern and contemporary, and reflected their dishes like they said it would. The amuse bouche dishes was lighthearted and fun, but highly executed nothing short of what you should experience at such a high end restaurant. The mains were as good as the amuse bouche, obviously with more complexity, but just the same integrity. From the SCALLOPS, SWEETBREAD, and DUCK. How impressive is it to drink DUCK BROTH mixed with and a glug of 1908 bottle of Madeira wine? I wasn't expecting to order two different bottles of wine with dinner (white with the seafood, red with the duck and sweetbreads), which was money wisely spent than by the glass. The food was excellent, the suggested wines were just as great, and I truly enjoyed ever minute spent dining at the Clove Club. The experience, was just another round of sprinkles on my ice cream trip to London. The Clove Club in my opinion beats Estela (NYC) on the Top 50 Restaurants of the world list. Totally worth the value and the experience, no questions asked.",

    "text": "Last night of our trip to London which included some good (Hardwood Arms, Lyles, Marcus, Nightjar), some meh (Ametsa, Dandeylyan), some awful (Greenhouse). Our expectations were ridiculously high and I left thoroughly pleased. I love the ambience, the quiet electricity in the room . The very open kitchen helps, and comfortable albeit slightly crowded seating. I like the lack of white table cloths; and I prefer a water bottle left on the table. The staff goes above and beyond to make you feel special; corny but true and really hard to pull off actually. Who Evers hiring here is doing an excellent job. Wine list is concise with many above average options for good prices. We enjoyed a Prager Riesling with a little age and a Cru Beaujolais with even a little more. And some Port and some Scotch. They poured a 1908 Madeira for one of the courses. It was exquisite.The food was memorable and sums up pretty much everything I love about the tasting menu format when it goes right. Mackerel, Sardines, the Pheasant consomm\u00e9 Madeira dish were my faves but it was all so good.This was top 3 for me up there with Commis and Meadowood. It may be the best meal I've ever had.",

Honestly, we were disappointed on the other items, except the the Buttermilk Fried Chicken. I am not sure about the tasting menu but we might be want to try the menu if we are in the area again.",

To reiterate my point about the generous portions, I was so uncomfortably full by course 3 that I would have unbuttoned my jeans right in the middle of restaurant if it wasn't such a classy place (and if i had less dignity). I couldn't even bring myself to so much as lick one of the chocolate caramels they brought out at the end...and desserts are my jam. Long story short, come here for an impressive meal and be prepared to eat.",

While you don't get the crazy creativity of a Heston Blumenthal here at The Clove Club, what you do get are unbelievably fresh and well-paired flavors. For instance, I usually can't stand sardines. However, one of courses was a raw sardine, and it was absolutely delicious. Not even the faintest hint of fishiness to the flavor. Other standout dishes include the fried chicken (wow!) and the fresh scallops (wow wow!)Just as important, the staff here is fantastic - casual, but they clearly know their stuff. Dinner isn't cheap here, but if you can swing it, I'd highly recommend a visit!",

They served me the following dishes before I told them I don't want any more food from the tasting menu I had already paid for in advance: 1. Crab tart (average)2. Smoked eel on cracker (dry and average) 3. Buttermilk fried chicken with pine salt (average) 4. Raw mackerel with smoked sauce and dashi broth (good)5. Smoked trout tartare with caviar and potato sauce (this potato soup will haunt me for a long time)6. Raw fish with horseradish on cracker with warm broth (good but the broth made it average) 7. Bread course sourdough with home made pancetta and coppa (average. Supermarkets in the south of Italy where I lived sold better coppa and pancetta also bread was average)8. Fish with smoked hazelnut foam and leeks (it tasted like bland hospital food and the leeks were raw)9. 100 day old farmed chicken - breast, thigh, crispy skin feet, smoked sausage (sausage was good but rest average and that crispy feet skin was so bad and lacked seasoning) At this point I decided I couldn't handle anymore food from their kitchen and left hungry (ate a wild boar burger at a bar nearby, dumbfounded and pondering how this place could possibly make the world's top 50 list)Ps- the FOH tried hard to salvage the situation - offered me complimentary sake (which I declined) and a whisky based cocktail that I accepted (and was delicious) but there was nothing they could do about the food which truly was subpar.",

They keep it simple with a prepaid tasting menu, and you can choose to add wine pairings if you want. They also have a tea pairing, which is really cool, especially for those who don't drink. Dinner starts with a tiny Bobby Bean Tartlette. I swear, London has the best green beans in the world, and it only gets better when you add fennel and lemon verbena mousse.A Crab Tart comes next. Delicious and a great presentation.A basket of Buttermilk Fried Chicken, buried in pine branches, sprinkled with pine salt. Tastes like Christmas. A gorgeous dish of tomato, nectarine, ham jelly is next. It looks like a garden and tastes like Versailles. They say that Scotland had an exceptional crop of Cep Mushrooms this season and it shows. They're just shaved and raw, and wow, I've never had a mushroom taste so much like a mushroom!Time to swim with the fishes. The Dorset Clams are awesome and then there's a meaty Sardine Sashimi with an awesome-sauce sipping broth. Scallops stuffed with nori are so tender! The crab broth adds some brine to them. The MEATS! The Aged Loin of Pork is a like a cross between ham and bacon with the texture of a very tender steak. And I love the breast of Grouse. It's like a duck but lighter, and I love the berry sauce it comes with. Dessert starts unexpectedly with Szechuan Pepper Mousse, and I'm so blown away by the surprise pepper ice cream at the core.Potato Jam resembles the inside of a French fry, and a slurry of potato mousse carries its sugar well. I didn't think this could be a dessert, but it's \u00a0kinda perfect with caramel ice cream.A flight of house desserts, and the meal comes to an end. Profiteroles and truffles are predictable, but then they bring on these jellies that are based on a favorite drink of Fernet and Creme de Menthe. It's like a soft, enjoyable punch in the mouth. Top-notch ingredients, great creativity and presentation. Why does Clove Club only have one Michelin star? It deserves two!",

    "text": "Raw Orkney Scallops, scallops, scallops!! More on that later...We took a couple of friends visiting from Texas for a surprise Birthday / Anniversary lunch. After almost getting lost (walking into the Town Hall building) we found the proper door - wasn't hard to miss with a brass Clove Club sign above it. The restaurant is amazing - nestled into the old Shoreditch Town hall. We were seated in the front - amazing ambiance and light from the big windows. There is also a more closed off area in the back with view of the kitchen.We wen't with the lunch tasting menu - washed down with bottles of our favorite Tempier Rose.All the dishes were very memorable and well put together. Especially good:- Smoked Trout cigars. Beautifully delicate and smokey taste.- Pine salt buttermilk fried chicken. AMAZING! It came in a basket of pine needles. The chicken was incredibly succulent and moist.- Charred mackerel - I believe they used a blow torch to char the outside. Very delicate and flavorful. - Amazing pork (I don't fully recall the preparation).The highlight dish.. Raw Orkney scallops. These were covered in generous truffle shavings and a thick inky sauce. To die for! We had a similar dish at another Michelin restaurant the next day with a similar dish and it didn't even come close! The scallops just melted in the mouth. More please!!! Having planned ahead - the restaurant surprised our guests with hand written Birthday / Congratulations cards and Happy Birthday candles. Nice touch! The meal ended with a selection of little chocolates, cakes and nibbles - beautifully presented.Cannot wait to get back here for dinner!",

    "text": "WOW. Whatever expectations I had about eating at Clove Club were obliterated and exceeded. My \"experience\" (because \"meal\" is too much of an understatement) at Clove Club was sublime: the food, people, staff, decor, and wine all meld together perfectly to provide a truly memorable and delightful event.It's not hard to speak in such hyperbolic terms about an establishment that manages to dole out a culinary adventure without the fuss. The interaction with the staff and the setup of the space fosters a feeling of dining at a friend's place rather than at a restaurant. In terms of the food, I can't pick a specific favorite because I was too busy trying to roll my eyeballs back to the front after each bite...each and every item was superb and the wine pairing took things to another level.Your pocketbook will certainly hurt, but I would skip dining out for a week to have even just one course here. I am fortunate to have a kid brother who treated me to a visit, and it will certainly go down as one of the best moments in 37 years of life.",

I was sat at the bar for my 5 course lunch. I had the company of Rob the barman, who is a top guy - even giving me recommendations for his fave restaurants for later that evening. And he was my geographical hero, giving me directions to Moorgate (which was only down the road as it goes). He explained each course and was chatty enough without being overbearing. Service was quick and efficient. The drinks he made were stunning - the sweetdram rum and clementine soda aperitif was sweet but refreshing and the railway sangaree cocktail was potent and delicious - the addition of porter to an otherwise sweet cocktail was inspired!The food was exceptional - the tasting menu consisted of snacks (spider crab with brown hollandaise, buttermilk chicken, haggis ball), tartare of trout, sea bass, roast fallow deer, burnt clementine granita and a warm apple tart tatin, plus further sweet snacks at the end (mini apple muffin, salted chocolate and a very boozy and potent ball of deliciousness!).Every course was spot on and I wouldn't have changed a thing - quality ingredients, cooked and presented to perfection.I can't recommend this place highly enough. A worthy entrant to the worlds top 50 restaurants. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I absolutely would",

It was that good.My eyes got so widely opened while having the course of \"Duck, Morel & Ginger Consomm\u00e9 and Hundred Year Old Madeira\" that I had a hard time trying to blink. It was so smooth and comforting, amazing!! The smoked lamb ribs were so delicious and Gods know the Brits can really cook lamb.Just a friendly reminder to bring an absolutely empty stomach for the 11 courses tasting menu, it will be such a waste if you were too full to enjoy every dish on their menu.",

    "text": "I knew I was going to love The Clove Club when I took a look at the cocktail menu and they had a drink called \"Powys and Gwent.\" Not being native to the UK I assumed that Gwent was a reference to the video game The Witcher. \u00a0Any place that can combine video games and artisan cocktails is ok in my book. \u00a0When I inquired about the name the bar tender was kind enough to stop by our table, discuss The Witcher, and then let me know that Gwent is actually the name of a kingdom in Wales. \u00a0Tasty and educational!In addition to cleverly named cocktails there are many reasons why I absolutely loved The Clove Club. \u00a0The menu is fascinating, delicious, and unique, the staff warm and charming, and the overall vibe of the place is of people really enjoying themselves (both staff and patrons).The tasting menu was a delight (and they only do a tasting menu, so not much choice there unless you opt for the vegetarian menu). Pushing some interesting envelopes of native British ingredients and flavors. \u00a0Interesting that for a cuisine that is almost devoid of spice the Chef is able to provide such a rich and flavor packed experience.The array of little bites to start were all wonderful. \u00a0I particularly enjoyed the Crab Tart & Brown Crab Hollandaise. \u00a0Even the Haggis Bun was yummy, and I am not a big Haggis guy. \u00a0I do have to point out for all the folks who have raved about the Fried Chicken that it is indeed good, but I recommend you try the Fried Chicken at Roister (in Chicago) before declaring it the best.The menu was a very interesting journey through 9 courses, which resulted in a very satisfying evening. \u00a0A few stand outs for me were the Spring Herb and Smoked Herring Broth which was deceptively rich with wonderful, velvety herbal overtones with an accent of Herring. Not at all what I expected. \u00a0Grilled Pollock, Grelot Onion, Cinnamon, and Curry Leaf was wonderfully subtle and the addition of Cinnamon Salt which you add yourself had a huge and very delicious impact on the dish. \u00a0Hot Smoked Lamb Ribs were absolutely delicious and a bit of a revelation (I've eaten many ribs, but never lamb). \u00a0The only dish that wasn't a complete winner was the 100 Day Old Lincolnshire Chicken - it was a bit dull compared to everything else.However, two of the dishes were so good and surprising they almost caused my head to explode. \u00a0Duck, Morel & Ginger Consomme and Hundred Year Old Madeira is ridiculously deep and layered and is a umami bomb. \u00a0The presentation of the dish only heightens the mind blowing first sip of this. \u00a0And then for desert was Wild Fennel Granita, Ewe's Milk Mousse and Warm Blood Orange. \u00a0The granita is amazing - bright green and pleasantly herbal without being sweet. \u00a0But the entire dish is brought together by the warm orange. \u00a0I was shocked at the huge difference made by having it warm. \u00a0Both of these dishes were genius.Service was very good and friendly. \u00a0It is totally in keeping with the character of the place. \u00a0Our staff were all clearly very happy there and described the restaurant in terms you usually here about a family. \u00a0It is clearly a unique place. \u00a0Our wait team was from many different countries in the EU, I wonder what happens to a place like this as Brexit takes hold. \u00a0The Clove Club seems to be a shining example of the power of the open model, so hopefully nothing gets lost. \u00a0I must also give extra special props for Dr Henderson's Bon Bon, which was one of the small bites presented at the end of the meal. \u00a0It is a genius way to end the meal - not sure who came up with this, but it is stunning. \u00a0The Bon Bon is a small drop shaped bite- think an M&M - which is filled with a mixture of Cr\u00e8me de Menthe and Fernet Branca, per Dr Henderson's old hangover cure (based on the brief explanation which was provided with the Bon Bon). \u00a0Not sure if the story was true but this bite perfectly wrapped up the meal - bravo.All in all this was a lovely evening and one of the most interesting and fun meals I've had in ages. \u00a0While this is clearly fine dining there is not an ounce of stuffiness to the experience.",

    "text": "The Clove Club was our first stop in London, and it certainly didn't disappoint! We ordered the full lunch tasting menu (which is the same as the dinner one), and enjoyed every dish except for 3-4.Some of the highlights from the meal were there the Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Grilled Red Mullet, and the Burnt Clementine Sorbet dessert. The Clove Club's fried chicken beat any fried chicken I've had in the states - it was so impossibly moist that I almost want to label it \"juicy\"! The Red Mullet surprised me because I typically find fish dishes slightly bland, but this one had a ton of spice and flavor. And the clementine dessert was one of the best ends to a meal - slightly sweet but-oh-so satisfying. The dishes that we didn't enjoy as much were the Raw Scallop with Truffle, Chicken with Morels, and the Broth of Smoked Herring. Instead of the typical shaved truffles you would get on a dish, the scallop course came with chopped truffle pieces (hard to fully taste in our opinion), and we felt like that raw scallops and truffle was a strange combination. The chicken dish, while well-cooked, felt like it didn't belong on an expensive tasting menu, and the herring broth was quite forgettable. Overall, we felt our meal was enjoyable, but didn't top the list of our favorite tasting menus. Given that we weren't fans of about a third of the courses, we probably wouldn't come back the next time we're in London, but I would definitely still recommend this place for locals who live in the area!",

I highly recommend just ordering the full tasting menu experience. Dishes seem very complimentary. One of our party got the optional dish of a risotto with Alba White Truffle which was delicious.The Raw Orkney Scallop was definitely the highlight of the menu.Great service, servers happy to answer questions about each dish.",

I didn't find any cocktails on the drink menu that appealed to me which was kind of a bummer.I read great reviews about their buttermilk fried chicken but compared to the US I think it fell flat. It may just be a cultural difference. I didn't like the cut of meat they used and felt that there was way too much breading. I liked the pine bowl presentation.",
