    "text": "As someone who was raised on Mexican food (real Mexican food) I was disappointed. I know I should not be entirely surprised as Mexican food has yet to make in in the UK but at least the restaurant did a few things right.You might laugh when you walk in, but 5 Stars on decor. I have to admit,it \u00a0is just like home. So it was nice to walk in and feel that little bit of cheesy warmth. \u00a0Although I felt a bit anxious when I realised my table of three was being watched by at least 5 staff not doing anything. The entire meal. The margarita was no bueno. In a margarita you should at least be able to taste the fact that there is tequila in it, sadly I could not. I have a feeling it was a margarita mix. And the stuff that they put on the rim... for the wrong drink. I did order the veggie burrito knowing that it could not go wrong. Yeah, I was wrong. There were ingredients that belong in Chinese food in that burrito, not Mexican. It also lacked many of the main ingredients (aka salsa, beans, cilantro, etc). I found it so sad the only thing keeping me from going into the kitchen and giving a free training session were my friends.Rice and beans are a staple, which means they belong in everything. I am hoping their chef reads this because I desperately want this restaurant to make it and will give tips if allowed, I miss good Mexican...",

But after a while, and a few well made Mojitos, it starts to add to the charm. Generally there'll be some groups wearing Sombreros: they have a seemingly inexhaustible supply. You can even get ponchos too if you are lucky. \u00a0What you will notice is that this place is generally quite busy.On to the food. Portion sizes here are big, I doubt very much that you'll leave feeling empty. It's your standard Mexican food, burritos, tacos etc. However, my personal favourite (not sure how authentically Mexican this is) are the Barbecue Ribs. They are pretty awesome, the meat just falls from the bone.Service is generally ok, although I did have one occasion when in a large group there were some \"extra\" items added to our bill. I managed to go back the next day and get a free meal for two out of them though. Just double check what you are paying for on the night when there's a lot of you.All in all a cheesy night out with lots of reasonable food.",

It's decked out like every other tex mex place around the world, with garish blow up Corona bottles and the like everywhere.However, what started as a mission to find nachos turned into us all ordering food. I had chicken quesadillas, Jules had steak fajitas and Michelle had chorizo nachos. All of it was gorgeous, and we got through two pitchers of frozen margaritas to wash it down. Two shared desserts later (hello toffee waffle!), and the bill came to \u00a325/head. Bar-gain.The amusing up-selling from the waitress wasn't even annoying, in fact, I applauded her tenacity.We sat with mexican hats on, gabbling about nothing, laughing and arguing about films. Plus, it was only 10 mins walk from Paddington. I can't wait to go back.",

One of the first thing's you'll notice is that everyone is wearing sombreros (and the staff give them to customers to wear if you wish). \u00a0But the food is not very good and it's very over-priced for the quality. The tortilla chips tasted like Doritos that were just put in the oven. \u00a0Every thing they serve is essentially mince meat (no matter what it says on the menu--burritos, enchilads, tacos, it's all just mince meat), and it's not particularly flavorful. And the drinks were watered-down, so even a jug of tequila mix won't give you a buzz. \u00a0 If you come from America (like me), where there's a lot of great Mexican food, you will most likely be disappointed. But if you don't know any better, shrug your shoulders, give this place a go (and keep your expectations to a minimum).",

Fun place, lots of character, silly sterotype Mexican music but all in all ok.Menu is large and full of the usual tex-mex fare. We were not really hungry so decided on tapas and some beers and virgin cocktails. The food was ordered and came fairly quickly, it was ok, but was very much the frozen ready made varity bit of a let down for the price. The waiter also seemed annoyed we didn't order mains, the place wasn't heaving at the rafters so I don't really understand his attitude. The food was ok, homr-made claimed sauce didn't really taste home made, but BBQ bottled style. It was just ok.We ordered waffles for afters. again ready made, ice cream had ice crystals in it and squirty cream :(The only reason I'm giving this place a two is their choice of cocktails, the food is ok, but over priced and I feel their are better ready made type tex-mex palces oyt there that do put a bit more effort into the bits that aren't ready made. The reason it loses out so much apart from the food being so-so, is two people in our party had dodgy stomches after eating here, nothing too bad but still.Wouldn't come back.",

Just avoid the prawn and crab tacos...they are a no go. The prawns are well shrimpy and the crab is untraceable.

It's a bit cheesy in terms of the decor - there are lots of large sombreros and blow-up bottles of lager, with some slightly naff wild west murals to boot, and the staff wear ponchos and straw stetsons. If you can get over that then you'll be pleasantly surprised - lots of authentic, filling mexican food and its quite cheap - we had a two course meal for two with drinks for less than \u00a330. If you're in the mood for a celebration then this is a good idea for a venue too - there are even more drinks choices than there are meals, including a page's worth of cocktails and there are margheritas and sangrias by the jug :) Recommended - oh, and there's a website - locomexicano.org",

Bizarre! Atmosphere -Not Mexican! think Disney world on a really small budget. It is a dirty little restaurant. Worst part is they play what they think is \"Mexican music\" at a volume so high you could not possibly hold a conversation with the person sitting next to you. Food -Not even remotely authentic, this restaurant is owned by the same people that own a Turkish restaurant around the corner.

I think this place is very generic and the food is what you would expect in a standard Mexican restaurant. \u00a0The place is very cluttered and not comfortable. \u00a0Our table was actually sticky from previous people. \u00a0Staff in general was polite \u00a0and friendly.",

    "text": "The food was really good- our first Mexican experience in London. Staff was friendly enough. I had the beef burrito and it was delicious, as well as a Strawberry Daiquiri which was slightly too strong- but better than being too weak I guess!Atmosphere was okay- music was a little too loud, and they obnoxiously played the Happy Birthday song (extra loud) at least three times while we were there. I wasn't expecting a quiet atmosphere by any means, but it was a little too much noise. Service was fast, friendly- the only other thing I have to say was that the ladies bathrooms were absolutely disgusting. Toilet paper everywhere, wet floors, dirty nappies lying on the floor... I'm very glad I went to the toilet after my meal, otherwise I would have been put off of eating there.",

Staff is very kind and the hospitality was good! The food was excellente and we had burritos, fajitas, nachos and enchilladas. Portions was good for the price and the taste was really good. Both the salsa and guacamole tasted great. Fun place for both families and goups of friends alike. A good place to eat and drink at the start of an evening out!",

Don't expect a memorable Mexican feast here. \u00a0Go to get a fill f decently representative Mexican food.",

The service was good, esp considering we were hanging out for a few hours. \u00a0I really enjoyed the mixed dips and the guac didn't taste like it was out of a packet! The enchiladas were very tasty - with a somewhat Indiany taste to me :) \u00a0I agree that the food isn't totally authentic with the veggies used, but it's flavourful and looks home-made.I would guess it was a family business, run by Cypriots perhaps?We also had a pecan pie for dessert which burnt my tongue a lil but tasted great with the toffee fudge ice cream!Would deffo go back if I was in the area! \u00a0Good efforts people :) x",

    "text": "As an American living abroad for a couple years I've have a distinct lack of Mexican food in my life. Therefore, I'm willing to overlook somethings when I go to a Mexican restaurant in, lets say, London. I can overlook things like the server having no idea what we're talking about when we \u00a0ask for a salted margarita glass. I can also overlook that when said margaritas arrive, they had what appeared to be, table salt on the rim. Whatever. Any port in a storm. Very strange guacamole? No biggie. \"Sour cream\" that had green specs in it. I can deal. What I can't deal with is extremely rude, push-you-out-the-door service. Our food came out (which was decent actually), and we asked for some hot sause. The guy came back with the hot sause, and our check. Seriously? we haven't even started eating yet. We continue to eat and as we finish (still not done) the guy comes back with the credit card machine and asks \"do you want to pay with a card or with cash\". Again, seriously? still working on the food here. I give him my card, he scans it and asks \"how much do you want me to put on the card?\" Is this some cultural thing I'm not familiar with? how about you put whatever the bill says? This is all just incredibly rude and pushed what would have been a decent experience into the realm of crap-tastic. AVOID!",

    "text": "I would hardly call this mexican.The service, for starters, was horrible. The restaurant wasn't even crowded when I strolled in here on a Sunday afternoon and yet I was left waiting for some time to order and again after I finished my meal. The food? Hmmmm. Nothing seemed fresh or prepared to order. The chips and dip left much to be desired. Both seemed to have come from a bag purchased at a local Tesco. Hardly anything worth paying \u00a36 for.I had the beef tacos and was honestly surprised the meet was quite tasty, however, the taco shells appeared to have come out of an Olde El Paso taco dinner kit from a week ago. Not fresh and so bland. Super disappointing!Still on the hunt for good Mex in London, but won't be trying this place again!",
