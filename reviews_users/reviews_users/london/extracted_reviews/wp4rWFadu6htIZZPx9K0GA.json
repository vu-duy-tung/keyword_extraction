Oh. \u00a0The staff are nice. \u00a0Maybe there's another reason. \u00a0They all seem thrilled to be working at Chipotle. \u00a0Which would be weird even for America, but it's super weird in the customer service wasteland that is the UK.",

The one I got in london looked like a starved developing world refugee(good P.S description huh ?)I got a steak burrito which i have to say was measly not only on the meat(which is the expensive ingredient), but on the rice and salad which \u00a0essentially cost nothing !!really their management needs to stop cutting corners and be more generous, one is forking \u00a37 for what is essentially a fat sandwich !!the thing is as much as i complain of the quantities served the ingredientsare good quality and better than what local chains serve !!i am not too sure whether i will visit again, but will keep you updated on their stinginess !!",

    "text": "I was rather surprised during my trip to London for the Olympics to find that London has finally discovered Mexican food exists (will Latin American cuisine be discovered next?). There were Mexican food places everywhere, even taco trucks, but alas I was rather leery of trying Mexican food in London (c'mon, who's ever heard of English food and jalapenos in the same sentence).However, I was traveling with a companion who's been living in Korea, and hadn't made it back home to the US for 2+ years, and was missing Chipotle so she was adamant that we eat here for lunch.I originally ordered a steak fajita, but after viewing how dried out the steak was (it was cooked beyond dead) I quickly changed to the barbacao. I got my usual tomato salsa, salsa verde, and sour cream mix.The tomato salsa is NOT the chunky salsa fresca you expect to see. It's a soupy, pureed mess that \u00a0is more like a chutney in taste and texture. The salsa verde looked like the stuff you can find in the US, but didn't have the heat factor. The barbacoa was moist, but missing the tang and zip of original Chipotle meat. The rice was also missing the cilantro-lime flavor that makes it so complementary to the fillings.All in all a filling meal, but I could have had much better food for the 7 GBP price. For ex-pat Americans truly missing home, you'll probably be satisfied with the food here, but for those that get to return home this Chipotle is worth skipping unless you just want to see how different the food tastes. Hopefully other Mexican food in London tastes much better than this sad offering, as although not authentic, Chipotle in America actually has flavor.",

But you have to know that Chipotle is THE THIRD BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN THE UK. Period. Hands down. No questions. (They're only the third best because I make the best and the Yelp etiquette of not naming other businesses prohibits me from naming the second best.) No cheddar cheese here. And \"chips\" mean a cut-up-and-fried corn tortilla. In the states, I shun Chipotle like I shun Starbucks. If there is anything more authentic, local business or the like, I'll always go there first. But here in this wasteland of Mexican food that is the UK, they deserve every 2p I can throw their way. They may be assembly line, but it's good. And you know, they are (unlike so many other fast food in the UK) fast.",

    "text": "I decided to finally hit up Chipotle recently as I needed to head to Oxford Street, and I had a craving for Mexican food.Expectations were high. In the US, I always saw Chipotle as a safe bet when other Mexican dining options were not immediately available, and I was hoping Chipotle in London would offer the same safe bet option.Walking into the restaurant, the d\u00e9cor was familiar, I already felt a bit at home. The downfall of this d\u00e9cor, however, is that the restaurant can get quite noisy since there is nothing to absorb the sound.I walked up to counter and asked for crispy carnitas tacos. The tacos were packed with carnitas, salsa, sour cream and cheese, and guacamole (which costs an additional \u00a31.40, by the way!). Dinner for two including non-alcoholic beverages, cost nearly \u00a318. The price was a bit shocking for what you get, but I was hopeful that the meal would be worth it.The tacos were OK. I found the tacos to be a bit too full to eat easily (1/2 was guacamole, so at least I got my money's worth there?), and the carnitas were a bit too crispy in some places, and unless you can eat in record time, your last taco or two will be a bit soggy by the time you get around to eating it.While the prices are a bit more than what you would pay in the US, and the tacos weren't quite as tasty, I would be inclined to return to Chipotle. The size of the tacos and burritos alone is almost worth the price, and the guacamole was definitely worth the extra \u00a31.40.",

Did I like it? Sure. But I wouldn't go so far as to say I loved it. Will I return? Well, stranger things have happened.

    "text": "I love Chipotle and have been waiting for this opening eagerly, keeping my friends posted on the delayed launch.I was dutifully there in line on May 10 and sad to say, was woefully disappointed.Here are my main issues:1. \u00a0Tortilla - it was bulky, stiff and tasted nothing like the soft, delicious tortillas that mold to your burrito in the U.S. \u00a0It seemed like they were trying to make the tortilla more healthy but in so doing, utter utter fail in the taste category. \u00a0Also, I saw several tortillas get thrown out because of intra-tortilla tears so this may be a far-ranging issue that goes beyond taste and into ingredient quantity and rolling technique.2. \u00a0Rice - the quality of the rice just seemed off compared to what I have seen at other Chipotles. \u00a0it tasted coarse and none-too-fresh, to be honest.3. \u00a0Tomato Salsa - no fresh tomato salsa. \u00a0none.4. \u00a0Quantity of Meat (and other ingredients) - this may be related to #5, but there was a clear reluctance on the part of employees to heave in the mountain of meat and other ingredients that give a Chipotle burrito its very identity, possibly because they know they will have to deal with it shortly.5. \u00a0Rolling Technique - packed very loosely. \u00a0I understand that the restaurant has just opened up but burrito-rolling is not rocket science. \u00a0Two folds and a roll. \u00a0You don't need to make a thousand to understand what makes a good roll. \u00a0Tightness is key.6*. \u00a0Price - much more expensive than Chilango and Tortilla. \u00a0I wouldn't mention it but given #1-5 above, value has come into play. \u00a0Why pay more for less? \u00a0I will not return until I hear that the recipe has been fixed. \u00a0Seriously, how hard is it? \u00a0It's been done.... over....and over....and over again.I suspect that Chipotle was trying to adapt to local tastes and ingredients, which sounds good in theory, but as they say - in theory, practice and theory are the same; in practice, they're different. \u00a0You're a chain. \u00a0Your responsibility as a chain is to provide a consistent and familiar experience every time I see your brand name. \u00a0That responsibility is heightened when you are as beloved as you are - the cost of popularity (some say obsession). \u00a0It is a competitive imperative when you launch in an environment of existing established burrito chains making very good burritos at lower prices.I'm sorry, Chipotle. \u00a0This may sound harsh but you have to be the most honest with those you love.",

So i was excited when i heard that they were opening a store in London ... though i was sure there was no realistic hope of getting cheap food anywhere on Charing Cross road.The store is large ... with very few furnishings and seats. A lot of the space is left empty and so it doesn't give the impression of a crowded store that i got in the US.The burritos are good and tasty. They are expensive ... at over \u00a36 for the meat options (chicken, pork and beef). But they compensate for the price with the quantity. The amount of food we get is significantly larger than in Chilango (which by the way is my favourite burrito joint in London). \u00a0But i can't understand the \u00a31.40 i had to pay for the guacamole. That's more than double ... almost triple the price at comparable places. I hope its because they use pure avocado and others use fillers. The drinks are also a rip-off ... with a very small amount of margarita at close to \u00a34. So a burrito and a drink can frequently set you back by more than a tenner.Overall i believe my experience at the London joint was good, though not as good as it was in New York. If only the prices (especially of the sides) were even remotely close to reasonable, i would come back often.",

    "text": "The worst Mexican in town at the highest price. What a joke. Having lived in the USA we were really excited for Chipotle, but they've really managed to screw it up. First off, the prices, yup. Ridiculous. They just put a pound sign in front of the USA ones, making it far more expensive then my personal favourite and the ONLY authentic Mexican in town, EL BURRITO. FYI, if you offer peppers, your cuisine is not Mexican, it is Tex-Mex. Okay, so after the offensive \u00a31.40 for guacamole you are looking at \u00a39.00 which is frankly unfair. I asked about the guac and they said it's expensive to make. No it's not. It's actually cheaper to produce than in California. Avocados are a fruit and they consume a lot of water. Most of ours come from Israel... Anyway, he gave me my \u00a31.40 tablespoon of guac and I paid for our food. Me and the mrs were well excited to dig in. At first bite I thought, \"that's odd.\" Took another. It was very salty. Gross salty. Wanted to make sure I wasn't being crazy, so the Mrs tried it. Yup, gross, spat it into a napkin. Went back to the counter asked the guy to try the pork as it was oddly salty. He came back and said that it was saltier than usual and he'd tell the chef. What about me moron? Nothing. So I ate around the pork and my lady was kind enough to share one of her tacos. I only realised after a few bites that she was willing to share because it wasn't very good. FYI, she had the shredded beef and it had zero flavour. Their salsas and guacamole as are lacking in flavour or zip of any kind. It was quite a strange experience. I thought franchises had some sort of quality control. Not here. Never again folks. Never again. I recommend EL BURRITO, then TORTILLA, then WAHACA.",

While it is more expensive than in America, the taste is still the same, and it seriously hits the spot when you haven't eaten all day. The service was quick, and pretty standard for London food service. I had the vegetarian burrito with pretty much all the fixings and the hottest salsa, and let me tell you, the guacamole is fantastic!

I've been away from home for over a month, who can blame me for hitting up a Chipotle in London? \u00a0It's different, but that's not entirely bad. \u00a0They do have the same selection of Tabasco bottles lined up neatly at the condiment/utensil station and they have the brown rice option (which I like) but I don't remember seeing a taco option. \u00a0Maybe I was just tired and my eye was on the prize (a fat burrito).I honestly didn't think the portion sizes were that different from back home. \u00a0In Denver, the burritos have shrunk over the years, but that's not a bad thing, necessarily. \u00a0The pico tasted the same... the chicken was slightly saltier and the HOT salsa, while tasting ever-so-slightly different was still spicy.Someone mentioned the lack of soda fountain. \u00a0Yep. \u00a0No margaritas or beer either... I don't think I saw chips and salsa on the menu, but for a taste of home, this really hit the spot.The staff were all incredibly friendly (there was even an American behind the salsa station!) and I didn't feel let down. \u00a0The pricing, for central London? \u00a0A steal! \u00a0For any Americans traveling over here, yeah, the dollar doesn't go as far, but you'll find that problem at McDonalds and the Gap... and Anthropologie, too.Chipotle why did it take you so long to hop over the pond? \u00a0I'm so glad you're here now!",

The restaurant is average sized with a nice furnishing - the usual you can expect from a fast food joint. The food is excellent - just as it is in the US. You really get what you expect. I'm getting hungry just thinking about their awesome guacamole. We've been to this restaurant twice - first time the service was very good, no problem at all. The second time though I had a few problems communicating, the lady behind the counter didn't seem to understand that I wanted two tacos instead of three and she was weird in general. But it all worked out in the end and we left the restaurant well fed both times. I really hope this won't be the last restaurant in Europe - it would be awesome if Chipotle would open a restaurant in Germany.",

Now, I recognize what an absurd statement that sounds like, and its intended to speak to the complete lack of anything resembling decent Mexican food in London in general, but Chipotle just gets it right. I also concede that burritos/tacos represent a very small part of the Mexican culinary catalogue, but there's nothing better in any of the other parts of the cuisine in London either.With full customization, properly prepared tortilla, meat, cheese, rice, and guacamole, and a reasonable price point, it always makes me a happy camper.

As a cynical Southern Californian, Mexican food is my holy grail. Yes, there has been endless, pointless arguments about \"true Mexican food in London\" and that horse has been beat to death. I will not go down that road, as I have sided that London Mexican food has its own category. While Chipotle is a California chain, their recent branching out to London has allotted me another option in London Mexican food. Having appointments in the area and a hungry stomach, I ducked into this Chipotle and ordered myself a delicious lunch of beans, rice, chicken and salsa. They know what they are doing here. They virtually perfected it in California (barring the minor occasions of e.coli poisoning) and have maintained what has made them so popular amongst surfers and the lot in So Cal. My recommendation, ditch the burrito and go straight for the Bowl. You get more food and it costs the exact same. I am partial to the chicken and medium salsa. I will go as far as suggesting that Chipotle's medium salsa is the best I have had in England. Bold statement, but I stand by it!",

And now that I'm a newly minted veggie, I opted for the veggie burrito bol for lunch. First off, the few reviewers who griped about the skimpy guacamole portions were clearly NOT served by whoever made my lunch. There was enough guac to swim in on my plate. It was epic, and I clearly was not going to complain about that. Other things that elevate Chipotle above the other usual suspects for me include salsa that actually tastes like salsa, rather than like BBQ sauce (c'mon folks, we've all been there with Mexican food in London before...), actual black beans, and friendly servers who have clearly been trained in America. Oh yes, I'll happily pay \u00a37 for that, gracias.I will shamelessly say that I am a big fan of the addition of Chipotle to London's burrito scene.",

Tender spiced beef, crunchy sauteed peppers, spicy salsa, and cooling sour cream. If portion size was doubled and rice was added in addition to the peppers I'd be a very happy man. For the price, it's a bit lower in value than I'd like but not too unreasonable.I appreciated the speed that the burrito was made and the abundance of chipotle tabasco made this a pleasurable dining experience and I'll go back next time I'm craving a burrito...and hope for a more generous server!",

I see people have commented how pricey the Burrito's are however you have got to realise you get what you pay for - in this case ethical, free-range and organic ingredients though I do agree with other reviewers - the Guacamole is far too expensive and though I am more than happy to pay extra for organic/free-range meats, I do expect a similar meat portion size which in this case looked to be under. For this visit I plumped for a Chicken Burrito with hot sauce, brown rice, black beans, cheese and lettuce and took a beer to wash it down. It was superbly wrapped meaning it didn't fall apart as I demolished it and the flavours balanced out nicely with the kick of the sauce intensifying near the end though if you want more sauce, you can help yourself to Tabasco brand varieties at no extra cost. For me this was a great Burrito experience along with the space but if you're still undecided which Burrito palace to visit or simply want more, then I suggest you read the 'Burrito Diary' of GirlCheese who's reviewed a LOT of places along with the different types of Burrito's in each girlcheese.posterous.com\u2026  Enjoy!",

In another lifetime, if for some bizarre reason I decided to eat at a Chipotle, I would have donned a mask and darted in, ordered, and darted out. Undetected.I can say this quite confidently bc not only have I frequented the Baltimore taco trucks - yes! they have a pretty tight and delectable food scene there - I've worked in some high end pan latin restaurants with some kick @rse authentic and very real Mexican chefs, eaten with frequency throughout Mexico and Cali and Arizona, and been the side kick along on many of my American friends' Mexican cravings...thus, I am pretty darn certain that I know what's good and what's awful Mexican. And I'm the girl who never used to even LIKE Mexican food. But sometimes, oh sometimes, I just get a craving for beans, rice, guac and salsa and think crapppp....Chipotle it may be. The lesser of the evils - bc thus far, London's Mexican offerings have left me pandering.Which is how I found myself standing at the counter of Chipotle in Charing Cross asking for the chicken burrito.

Chipotle, literally the McDonalds of Mexican food has the whole: \"no matter where you are, it'll taste like one of ours\", formulas down pat.If you've had one before you know what to expect. If you've not, then it's the Americanized and commercialized version of what they would never sell you street side in Oxaca but which passes as pretty decent healthful Mexican once you cross that border.It did the trick. And I can't believe that they didn't even adjust the prices across the pond. That's the real travesty here. That and the fact that I willing paid it!",

    "text": "I suppose it's fitting that my first Yelp review be on Chipotle. You see, I have a rare eating disorder. Since I was a child, all I want to eat is Burritos. Don't get me wrong - I eat other foods too. But I think about burritos when doing so.I love Burritos. I've been eating at Chipotle consistently for nearly 10 years now. I wouldn't necessarily say Chipotle has served me the all-time greatest burrito, but what I can say about Chipotle is that they have a consistent dining experience. That statement applies from eating at various Chipotles across different states in the U.S. to eating at Chipotle overseas, i.e. London. A few years prior to my relocation to London a Chipotle opened up nearby my office in northern California. Somehow, prior to my move, I became tired of Chipotle. I am not sure if it was that particular Chipotle or just Chipotle in general. It may have had something to do with the frequency in which I was eating there or maybe it all began with the fact that I ate 3 GIANT burritos in one sitting on the opening day of that location... I don't know. But the point is, I was all Chipotled out if you see what I mean. Then I moved to London. Perhaps it's the fact that I am hard pressed to come by a decent Burrito here in London (no authentic little taquerias) or maybe it's the ever-so-slight-difference in flavor that the ingredients found in London yields, but this place has rekindled my love for Chipotle! It's like I'm young man without-a-care in the world and a mad-hankering for burritos, all over again!As I said before, Chipotle offers a pretty consistent experience. The dinning experience is pretty consistent to what you would expect in the states. The taste is pretty consistent to what you would expect in the states (I don't bother with the guacamole at Chipotle...). The affable customer service is pretty consistent to what you would expect in the states. The portions are mostly consistent to what you would expect in the states (remember, they will never tell you NO if you nudge them for a little more of one ingredient or another... Extra, extra, extra cheese please!) Heck, even the numbers on the price tag are pretty consistent with what you expect in the states. You want to pay 6.95 for Burrito? No problem. Oh pounds not dollars you say? Who cares! I've been eating at Chipotle London pretty regularly for the past 6 months now. And I've noticed they've actually honed their techniques on the pinto beans. Previously their pinto beans were pretty hard-core. Literally. Now they seem to got 'er down and cook them a little longer. They've achieved the right level of mushiness. Bravo Chipotle. One of my all time biggest complaints with Chipotle is the fact that you have to buy your tortilla chips. It's probably not that big of a deal in the grand scheme. But growing up in the states, you become accustomed to the giant vats and endless supplies of gratis tortilla chips when you go to any mexican restaurant. Then along came Chipotle and changed that model - no more free chips. Eventually I got over it. But I've noticed at London Chipotle, they can, at times, be a bit skimpy on the disbursement of chips. And that has stirred up some feelings of past resentment. But not to worry. Where Chipotle lacks in the chip department, they definitely make up for in customer service.If you're genuinely not happy with the quantity of chips provided in the paper sack (as I've been a few times), simply go up to the counter and let them know. They typically empathize with your dissatisfaction and hand you another bag. They allow you to keep the first bag too. Not bad... Well, not bad for something most mexican restaurants give away for free (Ok so maybe I'm really not over it...) But nonetheless I never abuse their kindness. I only complain when there's like only 3 or 4 chips in a bag, or when I am super-duper hungry... (just kidding)Anyway, for now, Chipotle London is my Burrito haven. And that's quite alright by me.",

What goes with that is that the food is thoroughly Tex-Mex, with the flavours dampened down. And I have to say that the formula hasn't travelled all that well. On my last visit here, it was a busy Saturday lunchtime ; there was a queue of a good 15 people, all of whom, it has to be said, were dealt with efficiently. I noticed three points:1 \u00a0Every single person in the queue ordered a burrito, not a taco or a salad \u00a0is this because we Brits don't really know about tacos I wonder ?2 \u00a0The menu is exactly the same as in the US \u00a0the sole difference I noted was that the prices were of course denominated in \u00a3 not $. So , what in the US is a $6.95 burrito is50% more expensive here. Oh dear.3 \u00a0Even more oh dear, the barbacoa burrito I had was a good 50% smaller than it's US equivalent. And it smelled vile \u00a0not off, just not good.So , in essence, we're being bilked. Not good \u00a0up the portion size, reduce the price, but as it stands, it's somewhat overpriced and not great food.",

Given that fact, if you've ever eaten at a Chipotle in the states, you will be sorely dissapointed with it here. \u00a0They use the same exact formula but get rid of all the flavor and taste. \u00a0The rice is usually hard and the guac and salsa don't have much taste. \u00a0I have officially given up on this place. \u00a0Also, they don't have fountain soda.

    "text": "I was a HUGE chipotle fan back at home and was really excited when the first one opened in London. If I were reviewing this at home, I'd give it 5 stars since seriously, I'm obsessed with this place, but I guess I'm downgrading it to 4 stars because of the price! Anyways, for all you Americans who want a comparison..THE MENU- Meat selection is the same- Salsa selection is similar as well, but it appears they have one more category of red salsa, and the corn option exists but the corn is a strange whiteish color instead of yellow- several miscellaneous items such as \"margaritas\" exist under drinks, also drinks are not refillable (per much of London's restaurants) and instead you purchase bottles/cans (certainly no free bottomless drink for flashing a student ID!)- THE ALL IMPORTANT RICE: 80% similarity.. feels a little less soft and more like individual rice particles instead of a scoop. also, instead of just one rice option, there was TWO... one white and one brown (both had cilantro)THE PRICE- the same but not. same numbers but in \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3, so approximately 1.5x moreTHE VENUE- same metallic furniture and brownish decor- similar stands with same napkins and SAME CONDIMENTS (yes, they did have all the tabascos! regular, smoked, and green)If you're an American missing chipotle, it'll definitely be close enough to make you happy.. so let's just suck it up and pay the \u00a37 even though we know it should be $7 :P",

    "text": "My true love in life, the burrito! Having moved home to London from California, my heart was broken at the thought of never being able to have a torpedo burrito again. Especially when I remembered that when I left England, their answer to Mexican food was Chequitos (blech).My US expat friends - rest easy knowing that the Chiptole burrito is intact, along with their lime and rock salt chips. Unfortunately, we're dealing with UK portions here. I literally gasped when I saw how many chips were in the brown bag - it's just like getting those quarter filled bags of Walkers crisps!!I have to agree with some of the other reviews on the rice, it's just not as soft as the US. For whatever reason the rice is cooked al dente, but on the plus side you get the option of having healthier brown rice. The servers are a little stingy when it comes to sour cream, cheese, lettuce so don't feel shy about asking for more - they'll always add more and for no extra charge.Price wise you're paying double the $ value I'm afraid. Two burritos and a burrito bowl costs me around \u00a320! I guess that's the price we got to pay for a taste of semi-real Mexican food. Still waiting for the day a taco truck finds its way to London!",

    "text": "Sorry Chipotle but I'm just not feeling it. When I saw the hoardings going up opposite Foyles I thought \"Oh good\", my American friends were pretty excited and I'm always hearing how much certain people miss Chipotle. In the last few years there's been an explosion in places to get a burrito in London but the Mexican food density is still nowhere near as high as in California and there's a big difference between genuine Californian-esque burrito places and terrible faux-Mexican Restaurants. I felt a bit like this place was a cross between the two, it's obviously part of a chain so I wasn't expecting much character, which was good as there wasn't any, it looked like the whole place had been designed as a cross between a Magnet kitchen and a McDonalds. The first time I intended to go was just after it opened and there was a queue outside the door. We went elsewhere. The second time it was still busy but not quite as bad. I ordered my burrito but had to take some time to explain the system to my confused friends. I felt embarrassed by the price, thinking this was a \"fast food\" kind of place I told them it'd be quite cheap but at \u00a37-8 for a burrito plus \u00a31.40 for guac I was a bit gobsmacked. The burrito I had was pretty lacklustre, the meat was tough, the ingredients were all separate so it was a mouthful of rice followed by a mouthful of beans rather than them all mixing up nicely. Halfway through the flimsy tortilla gave up and burst in the tin foil meaning I had to finish it with a knife and fork which is the perfect sign of a bad burrito. Similar things happened to my friends. Even then the resulting, grey mess wasn't that nice, I actually left some and people who know me know I would never abandon a burrito unless it was seriously dire. I don't know why I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1. I mean I guess it wasn't as bad as it could have been, it was at least clean, the toilets were alright and the staff were friendly, it's got an excellent location too. A major but selective gripe is that being a rather rotund person (probably through too many burritos) I found the tables too low and small, the chairs were fixed so I had to squeeze my tree trunk legs in between the seat and table. Uncomfortable. Anyone who says this is the 'best' Mexican food or anywhere near needs to click that box at the top and search for 'burritos' and 'London' because seriously, people, there are so many way better places out there.",

Cause they were the OG in the gourmet burrito craze, those who shall not be named copied them from start to finish, and now Chipotle is coming here to lay down the law. And I can get behind that. Their tortilla chips were absolutely divine, with just the right texture, amount of salt and pinch of lime, the salsa was spicy and the guac was thick and delicious.

There was a black girl who was very kind, but had no technique in terms of rolling my burrito and it fell apart in my hands as I ate it. Awful. She needs more training.5) They have incredible Belvoir spring water drinks which are pricey at 2 pounds but so worth it when you are on vacation.6) Their food is not consistent in the sense that I had VERY spicy beef one day, and then perfectly spiced the next, then under spiced on the last try! Their cooks are either not following the exact recipes given or they are just winging it, which sucks.",

On my arrival early evening on a Monday, the queue was out of the door, mostly Americans and other tourists wondering what was going on. After waiting 20mns I made it to the counter. There was no question I was going to have a burrito. Taco - to small. Bowl - really, just throw my ingredients in a circular shaped basket, I don't think so. So a pork burrito it was.The two main competitors to Chipotle is Tortilla and Chilango. So how did it stack up against them. Shape, size and ingredients were pretty much the same. Price - quite a bit more. \u00a318.15 for two burritos and a non-alcoholic drink, WTF! The all important taste - it was good. Although it was not so good I'd be prepared to spend the extra dosh when I slightly, just slightly prefer the mightier and more filling taste of a Chilango.This place is good, with clean burrito's and i've heard, dynamite nachos and guacamole. This place is a 3.5* eatery, but seeing as I gave Chilango a 4*, and the potentially fatal shock I went through when given the price for my food, sorry Chipotle, you get a 3.",

    "text": "Whether you're an American expat or a curious Brit, London's first and only Chipotle is kind of like a rite of passage. First off, far and away the biggest complaint and the main reason for the star docking: The prices are obscene when you convert pounds to dollars. I realize that it's a novelty and the only one in the UK, but it's a bitter pill to swallow if you're used to $6 tacos and burritos at home and now find yourself paying $10-$12. You're also stuck getting cans or bottles if you want a drink; there's no soda fountain.The food is good and generally tastes the same way it does at home. I appreciate the brown rice option, and the fajita veggies are a little more varied. It's comfort food where it counts, and I suspect that this will be enough for most people. I don't think Chipotle does enough to educate people about the ordering process. I went with some friends and had to walk them through it. This is fine, but it can really clog up the lunch-hour traffic if someone has to ask about how to order. Seating is also at a premium during the peak hours, and sometimes it's standing room-only, which makes eating a burrito kind of a pain. You'd think they'd have a bigger place for a flagship restaurant.Bottom line: It'll hit the spot, but it'll also hit your wallet.",

The Chipotle chain gives tasty flavours and great portions and a reasonable price of around \u00a37.I hadn't been to this branch before, but was surprising my flatmate for her birthday by bringing her sister down for the weekend, so where better to do this reunion that a burrito bar, right?! I know that's what you were all thinking, anyway.Nice atmosphere here, long table down the middle of the store means you feel more sociable than just being stuffed onto small tables. When you're a party of 6, it's even better than trying to push 2 smaller table together. Not too packed at 7pm on Friday so you can sit down. I had the chicken burrito with brown rice (healthy New Year's Resolution kicks in there) and medium spiced salsa. I like the medium here, it's the right balance so you get some heat without exploding!I preferred my burrito at another chain to this one, hence only 3 stars over the usual 4. It was a bit wet and not put together well so it fell apart on eating. I think they should have drained the chicken a bit more. But great flavours, lots of salad, sour cream, cheese really bring out the beans and coriander rice. \u00a37 is a bargain in the middle of London too!Yum yum!",

The same stuff they offer in all the chipotle's across the world and the prices is the exact same...6.95 for a burrito...WAIT A MINUTE, but it's in British Pounds!!! So it's actually 1.6 times the price of an American burrito, if you overlook the fact that they also give you less of each ingredient.Still tasty though.",

    "text": "It sort of bothers me that when people review Mexican restaurants they completely ignore the stratification of the cuisine, and compare fast-food places with trendy high-end Mexican (which in London still bears little resemblance to American Mexican, let alone actual Mexican food). \u00a0Seldom do we compare a hamburger from McDonald's with the incarnation found at Bar Boulud, but somehow all \"Mexican\" places are compared with one-another.Chipotle is not Mexican food -- it's American. \u00a0It's the fast-food version of a Mission style burrito from San Francisco, and for fast food, its great. \u00a0I went last night and had chips, guacamole, a burrito, and a quesadilla \u00a0(shared, not alone; i am not a pig). \u00a0Everything was fresh, yummy, filling and quite cheap. I prefer this place to Daddy Donkey, Chilango (poor imitation, imo), and of course, the second rate places littered around town.Sure, don't go here expecting the same cuisine you had on your lovely vacation in Oaxaca in 2003, but don't shit on it because they serve fast food.",

It still took a while to get our food, since I think it'll take a few weeks for the staff to become as fast at making burritos as their American counterparts. They ran out of tortillas for burritos! Unfortunately, I had to get tacos instead.So is the London version of Chipotle the same as the American version? Pretty much, but not exactly. The chips and salsa taste the same but the amount of chips they gave us in a single bag was puny -- about half the amount in an order of chips from an American Chipotle. The numeric values of the prices are about the same as in the US, except that it's in pounds here instead of dollars, so yeah, that makes it about $10 for a burrito, whereas the most expensive Chipotle locations in the US (the ones in NYC) charge about $8 for a burrito, if I remember correctly.I was happy to see that they offered Brooklyn Lager (for the NY expats)! They also had Goose Island for the Chicago expats. :)I think Chipotle will do quite well in London. I definitely plan on coming back and bringing some more natives with me.",

Many Americans are of course highly disappointed with the Mexican food available in London, so I was curious to see how this direct transplant from the USA (rather than an imitation) compared to my other burrito experiences in London. I was however encouraged that the two raised-in-the-US Yelpers I came here with, Erica U and Kerrin R, were happy to come along.And, I have to say, I was pretty satisfied with my experience. I went for a beef burrito with brown rice and the other usual fillings (guacamole excluded) and I liked it: good quality, and fresh ingredients (not something that can be guaranteed if my experience at other burrito places is anything to go by), particularly the beef, which was excellent.Service was good: quick and friendly. I didn't really see what else they offered but I believe it included beer and the usual tortilla chips etc.The interior is worth a mention too: no colourful decor with boppy music often found at other burrito joints. Instead, a rather understated if modern combination of low hanging lights, metal stools and a lot of light-coloured wood. Overall, I liked it.",

I opted for a carnitas burrito with brown rice and guacamole.A few reviewers were bitching here about the portion sizes being smaller than the US... No way! \u00a0This was the biggest burrito I have had from a chipotle. In fact the foil wrapper didn't even fit around the circumference. Maybe they have optimized the sizing since opening.Overall it was pretty similar to the US version but the brown rice and wrapper didn't bring anything to the party in my opinion except giving it the air of something slightly healthy which I really don't think it is. Also the cheese tastes like real cheddar cheese rather than the bland American cheese and the salsas are slightly different.Overall tied with Chilango for me for top burritos in London.",

THEY also were very tight about the extra salsas, the woman said she wouldn't charge me this time, but they usually do charge. Some of the menu has changed, but I guess that's to be expected overseas?P.S. If you want lemon, expect a lime.

It's got the same vibe. However I like this one more as the restaurant has big windows and it feels more laid back. My review for the other store also is the same though, I've eaten at both and they is nothing to differentiate the quality or range between them - in fact, or any of the others I've visited worldwide. Here's what I wrote for the other store - which also hold true for this one: Chipotle do some of the best burrito's in London I think. They're around \u00a36-7 each depending on your fillings and extras. I like that you're burrito won't be soggy, that the contents are fresh and you know what you're getting - the same as you would in any of their chain stores, a filling tasty meal that's one of the best great fast food option's out there. I personally love that they have Negra Modello, one of my favourite beers of all time, a darker more caramel version of normal Modello. It's the best beer for burrito eating by far, and I'd recommend that you splash the extra cash to round off your meal this way. They also have a great selection of hot sauces to suit any palate. Do watch out however as they charge \u00a31.40 (or around that price), for guacamole, which I think is a rip off.",

There was a bit of a line, but it seemed to go down in no time at all.- The staff were sooooo nice! I wasn't sure which meat I should get for my husband, so I asked for a recommendation. The lady behind the meat-area then gave me a pot with some of each meat to try, so I could choose the yummiest! How friendly is that!?- I chose the veggy version for me.

However I was pleasantly surprised!I opted for chicken tacos (the soft ones) and chose my toppings. Probably the only thing about Mexican food I like is guacamole... But you had to pay for it which was slightly disappointing. It came to \u00a36.70 (without the guac) which I suppose is reasonable! The chicken tasted really good, but it was just a bit messy to eat, but that was to be expected! The only thing that I found a bit annoying was that I couldn't hear the lady properly when she was asking me what I wanted on my tacos, therefore I felt I missed out on having more on it because I just wanted to get to the end and pay! However I think I would come back here again and maybe try a burrito or 'bowl'.",

Getting to the counter I was faced with the following questions:-What would you like? BurritoWhite or Brown rice?BrownBlack or Pinto beans?PintoWhat meat?SteakI thought that would be all that was required... I was wrong... As soon as the tortilla had finished heating it was laid on it's piece of foil and the filling started, or at least it should have. The same server was doing the filling, and I experienced a little deja vu...White or Brown rice?Brown...Brown rice is addedBlack or Pinto beans?PintoPinto beans are addedWhat meat?SteakSteak is added...What was the point of asking me in the first place?The fillings at this point didn't seem like a huge amount so I bulked it out with cheese, sour cream, mild salsa, corn salsa, lettuce and guac. The guac is expensive, but I seemed to get the last of the current batch which meant a little extra than the guy in front of me.The burrito itself? Decent enough, the meat was very wet though which it didn't seem to be when it was being put in the burrito. Literally dripping out of the bottom. Nice to have tabasco on hand in both red and green varieties to add to the burrito itself. The stools could be better if they could be moved a little, being fixed does make them a little awkward. Look, it's a burrito, it's good and it's quick and probably healthier than a burger and fries. What's more to ask?Probably would have been 4 stars if not for the duplicate questions and the price of the guac.",

Some Minnesota (\"...soda-pop...\"). And a sweet Southern \"y'all\". Almost like being back in the States!Anyway, the food. I've had Chipotle's in the US and I've had their competition in Reading. This was just as good as the former and better than the latter. Fluffy soft burrito with a nice-sized scoop of coriander-lime rice, a scoop of delicious chopped chicken, some corn salsa (Too mild. I should have had them add a spicy one.), sour cream and guacamole.Rather than Coke or bottled water, I opted for something different and grabbed a can of San Pellegrino Limonata. Nice touch. I didn't notice if there were beer options.If it's your first time, have the burrito. But if you must, the salad or the bowl are solid options. If you're a veggie, they also have options without beef, pork or chicken, such as grilled vegetables.Because the place is so packed, good luck finding a seat. You may have to wait a bit.",

    "text": "This is how my brain reacted when it found out about a Chipotle in London:\"OMG CHIPOTLE MUST EAT NOM NOM NOM\"It's not exactly the same as back home, but that's because they source all of their ingredients locally. It also explains the high(er) price tag. Yes, it's more than Chipotle in the states, and it's comparatively expensive to other takeaway shops. But you'll notice on the big board that you can see where all the meat comes from. And since there are a total of TWO Chipotles in the U.K., not an empire, they can't exactly command discounts from bulk buying.Still, it's absolutely worth every pence. Just a few months out of the states and away from my beloved Mexican food is enough to make me rapid for some properly spiced chicken, and in this regard Chipotle is pure heaven.There are a few notable differences here. Namely, you can get brown rice instead of the traditional white, the peppers include red and yellow bell peppers, and the mild salsa is less like fresh pico and more like a traditional salsa with a sweet kick.But it's still Chipotle through and through, and it's brilliant. Go, nom.",

    "text": "As a Californian visiting London, I was impressed with the amount of Indian cuisine available everywhere, sit down, takeout, expensive and less expensive. It reminded me of the plethora of Mexican restaurants back home. Tacos are a staple food for me. I eat them several times a week and can eat tacos pretty much any time, any place. I like them in all varieties and price points and this includes the crunchy hard shell-ground beef variety. All kinds of tacos have potential to be good tacos. I've got some favorite hole in the wall places at home, but I am never above a good Chipotle chicken or steak taco, a veggie bowl or a big ol' burrito.It was a long, cold visit in London. Too many beers. Too many jacket potatoes. Too many potatoes. Just a lot of potatoes. And maybe too many curries. Never too much tea, however.It was time to have a teeny, spicy reminder of home (just once).Chipotle in Charing Cross was like a taco beacon for a late lunch. I told myself it wouldn't be like home and that I should be okay with that. It was almost like home. This close. So very close to every Chipotle in the US, but for two things:1) Corn tortillas2) Fresh pico de galloThese were not an option and I just felt sad for every Londoner who doesn't get to enjoy tacos with those two things.I will eat a flour tortilla burrito, but my heart belongs to small, yummy corn tortillas and fresh tomato, onion, pepper, cilantro and lime/lemon pico de gallo.London wins on so many levels, but not this one.Sorry Chipotle, London. You made a valiant effort and I am grateful, but I probably will stick to Chipotle USA.",

    "text": "I was incredibly excited to see a branch of US burrito chain Chipotle open up in London. They're a little behind the curve though - so many burrito places have opened up recently that they're not the big guys in town. Burritos here are pricier than at other outlets (Benito's Hat, Chilangos, etc) and a lot more expensive than the burrito trucks (Luardos, Daddy Donkey). Burritos are about the same size here as other places in London (but smaller than the burritos I remember from back in the US). If you're ok with paying 7 quid for a burrito (add guacamole for 1.40!!) then I guess this is the place for you - otherwise, while the quality of the ingredients is maybe a bit higher than the other places, you might still end up feeling a bit ripped off. A few positives - the carnitas I had was full of porky flavour and there was a nice selection of Tabasco sauces to amp up the spice. There's also pretty decent seating, which makes it a good option for a fast, sit down meal in this part of town, where you can still get out for under a tenner a head. I wish I loved it more - I'll just have to go back to the ones in the US to get my proper Chipotle fix.",
