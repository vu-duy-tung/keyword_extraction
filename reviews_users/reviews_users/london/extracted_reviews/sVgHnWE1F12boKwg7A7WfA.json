Sadly, this was my experience recently when looking to book this venue for a large group. As host of corporate executives, business people and various community members there could have been an opportunity to shine for future bookings alas we were not afforded that opportunity. I cannot report on table service or quality, however the venue looked lovely inside, the facilities were clean and the outdoor space was beautiful. I was told it was being redesigned so looks like they'll have something new soon. Maybe it's great for dinner or drinks for two, but I can tell you they're not interested in large groups, y'all.",

The restaurant has a nice clean classic vibe with upbeat music and an outstanding, warm service team. \u00a0My son ordered the pizza which was excellent, a perfect thin crust, and right amount of cheese. My daughter has tortellini with mint and pine nuts. Fresh and not drowned in heavy sauce. My wife had the Cornish hen, also tasty. I had the sea trout. I found it fresh and not over cooked. It had a fennel and cous cous side which was excellent. The side salad was outstanding too, with an amazing dressing. Also had a side of fresh veggies, which was kale with garlic and chili. Finally my wife and I shared the Panna cotta. Also not overly sweet and really creamy. The kids had hot chocolate, which yet again was well done and not overly sweet. What can I say. \u00a0For me it hit all the right points: \u00a0nice, comfortable, clean environment, nice music, great service and fresh, well prepared dishes with lots of veggies and nothing drowning in sauce.

People came and went and all were sat in the cabanas despite having no reservations for those seats (im positive they did not). the manager was flustered a little rude and forced several people to move upon seating themselves in cabanas. but after a while she gave up and let people sit where they wanted in the cabanas. We left at 11:00 and the 'reservation party' never appeared to show up.

However, by the luck of God, the booking was cancelled and we were able to be seated in one of the Igloos! Yay, us! We were not that hungry to begin with so we ordered a couple of tapas to share.

    "text": "Coppa Club aka Nope-a Club!We were seated right away on a Saturday night at about 9pm (didn't expect much of a wait for a later service anyhow). Didn't make reservations so didn't sit in the igloos. Our server greeted us with a bottle of water and a joke and asked us where we were from. He gave us some time to take our order. Took our order, still seemed amicable. And then after a bit the bartender brought over our drinks and our starters arrived. Our main courses arrived almost 30 min after we received our starters and the rib eye I ordered to be medium rare was well done. I don't normally send it back, but we were celebrating my birthday and I thought I deserved a steak done how I liked it on my birthday! So I asked our server and he apologized and sent it back. Meanwhile, my sister finished her entree (crab linguine - not too bad). And I ate some of the house salad I ordered as a side. Avocados were passably ripe and some of the lettuce was past it's freshness (we could tell even in the dim light!) While waiting for food, I saw a server lift up another colleague ... just casually carried her sideways and talking with another colleague as she was dangling there. Later on she went to address a table next to us and bent over the table ... guess who was trying to eat her starter with a derri\u00e8re next to her (yours truly). And we observed our server running around all stressed. We also overheard conversation about crying patrons and witnessed a lady complaining to a server. It seems tensions were high with the staff and there might've even been issues with servers taking each other's tables? That was our best guess. It's like everywhere we looked, there was drama unfolding which really took away from our service. It ended up becoming quite entertaining though. Food tasted mediocre by the time it arrived and I can't say anything particularly remarkable about it. \u00a0Oh! For you drama lovers - we didn't know the actual story behind the complaining lady but she talked to multiple staff and we eventually saw the doorman/security walk with her. Our server came to ask us if we were done eating and he seemed frustrated so we didn't ask him for the dessert menu, and to be honest, by then I wanted to have it elsewhere anyway, if that meant salvaging a very underwhelming birthday. I wasn't mad at our server as he got seemingly distracted and visibly frustrated as the night when on, I actually felt terrible. Coppa gets 1 point for effort, but 0.5 for execution and I'll give them 1 for food.",

Very stylish looking place overlooking the river, gorgeous views (especially if you can nab a seat outdoors or by the large windows). Quality of food & drinks were top notch and reasonably priced for the City. Complimentary water regularly topped up too. Surprisingly, the bar wasn't too packed despite being a great location for both city workers and tourists (though I'd still recommend booking if there's a big group of you). The service upbeat and friendly, the only downside being that the drinks occasionally took a while to come out - I assume because the cocktails are popular and the bartenders take their time over them.",

Group morale is at an all time high. This London trip has been an emotional roller coaster but thanks to Coppa we are all happy as a hippo. We were a big fan of the staff and the ambience of the restaurant. It's conveniently located next to the Tower of London and all kinds of other great British things. Prices were not bad at all for such a great place. The eggs Benedict on the salmon though \u00a0probably my new favorite breakfast item. So tasty, fam! I wouldn't lie to you. Strongly recommend",

Cons: I had severe dietary restrictions and made this clear to the waiter. Him and I discussed what the kitchen could make that I could eat. He even went back to the kitchen twice to remind them. When my dish was brought out (about 30-40 minutes later), an extra five ingredients (some of which I specifically stated I could not eat) had been added. I also found the restaurant to be fairly expensive and loud. I give it two stars instead of one because of the waiter and ability to get a table, but all in all, much more attention should've been paid to my food, and we ended up having to leave because of this because we didn't have time for it to be remade.",

The service is fast and very friendly and if one has questions they can answer every single one. The food was delicious; but for my purposes and that's to be fed up, the portions were definitely too small. Wich is why we ordered a desert. The cheese cake was delicious and after that, one could say that that was definitely the highlight on this evening. Nevertheless, there is something I criticize; If you'd want to make a reservation for the evening, you couldn't because they are not used to pick up the phone. And when we arrived these wonderful looking igloos with a gorgeous Thames view were already filled with people.",

    "text": "Skating at the ice rink or sightseeing at the Tower of London? If you find yourself by this historic landmark, I recommend sauntering over for a cozy bite to eat!Situated a few buildings away from the Tower of London and right by the riverside, the Coppa Club is a prime location to dine while enjoying the sights. They even have these clear hemisphere shaped pods for outside seating that instantly draw your attention and envy--although I imagine the people inside might feel like they are on display or animals at a zoo exhibit. Anyway, those pods were all reserved when we talked to the greeter, so call early if you want to eat in one of those!There was no line when we went in on a weekend night although there was a fair amount of people inside. The place seems spacious, with a bar area as well as traditional dining area. Stepping out of the biting cold, we were taken to the back and quickly got settled.With your typical fare, salads, pasta, steak, fish, etc, I ordered the trout. Our server wasn't particularly helpful in the decision process nor did he seem particularly cordial or patient.The food took a bit of time to arrive but wasn't too long that I noticed the time passing. Being the uncultured fish connoisseur that I am, I was surprised when I took a bite of it and thought it tasted exactly like salmon! Guess I can't really taste the difference.I thought the trout was satisfactorily tender and the skin was perfectly crispy. The citrus flavor from the orange was a great touch, and the side of couscous (or some thing resembling that) was a great pairing. My only complaint was that I wish the portion size was a bit bigger. I guess you should probably order an appetizer too if you come here.I would recommend booking the outside pod dining experience if you know you will be around the tower bridge area!",

    "text": "Traveling alone is difficult enough, and unfortunately this restaurant decided to add to the headache. On a Thursday evening I walked up to Coppa and asked if there were any seats available at the bar for one. He hostess said no, then said 'well you can just get a drink', THEN said 'and maybe some nibbles'. When I told her this was fine with me, she said 'well maybe they will serve you a burger or something'. It was the oddest welcome I have ever had at a restaurant! When I assured her this would work for me, she moved to the side and said 'well come in then'. I felt as though I had been through some kind of initiation process. I found a single seat at the bar, and the bartender came over quick enough given how busy they were. I ordered a glass of wine and asked for a food menu for the bar. He said the entire menu was available, which was quite confusing given my experience with the hostess. Anyway, I ordered the crab and avocado appetizer (surprisingly different than what I was hoping for) and the super greens salad (great!). The bartender automatically served me the larger glass of wine (yay?) so would recommend future diners tell them the size they would like up front. Overall, I don't know I will be back. Even if I were there with my usual entourage, I'd rather patronage a restaurant that treats their customers well.",

The view is amazing, I watched London Bridge the entire time that I was not watching the igloos. The service is amazing and the servers were attentive. I ordered the steak and that is the best recommendation I can make. I really enjoyed my steak. Though the portion was small, they did sprinkle some greens on top. This was an amazing spot to eat at.

Instead, we took our chances with a walk-in for brunch at 9/10am in the morning. With our luck, the four of us were led into one of the pods shared with another table of two. Even with our luggages in hand, we were able to fit comfortably inside. Coppa Club has the best aesthetics going on from the palm leaves hanging above the pods to the silverware on the table.Since it was my last meal in London, I decided to opt for the English Skillet Breakfast (\u00a39.45) and a Lean Green Juice (\u00a35.45). I felt like I needed some veggies and energy, so the green juice helped. As for the English breakfast, it consisted of two fried eggs, sausage, dry cured streaky bacon, Spanish black pudding, field mushrooms, roast tomato, Heinz baked beans, and toast. I wasn't a huge fan of all the ingredients on the plate to begin with and trying this dish only reconfirmed it for me. I'm not mad since I really wanted to try the English baked beans that London is so well-known for. Despite that, the meal was still pleasant; but the Waffle Benedicts (\u00a38.45) that the rest of the table ordered were very tasty. Overall, pretty place with London views in a igloo pod.",

    "text": "I absolutely loved Coppa Club when I had lunch there last week. I would recommend making a reservation in advance and asking to be seated in one of the igloos outside that sits out on the water (make note that these are shared igloos so you won't have a lot of privacy)! The restaurant itself is quite large so we were able to be seated inside right away with no reservation. Coppa Club is located in a very central location of the city, right next to the Tower of London and about a 5-10 minute walk to Tower Bridge. They offer a wide variety of food options. We started with the bruschetta which was so-so and then had a burger and a margherita pizza. The pizza was delicious and had amazingly thin crust! We finished out meal with the apple rhubarb tart which was very flavorful and flaky. It clearly was made to order!Overall, I would definitely recommend Coppa Club but beware that this is not a restaurant where you will have that quick of service. We ended up staying for a little over an hour and a half which we did not expect to happen but we are also Americans who expect things to happen a lot quicker than normal!",

    "text": "Last night I went to Coppa Club with a group of friends to experience the glass igloos. The igloos themselves are quite cute, warm and make for a lovely evening. The service of the restaurant however was quite terrible. When we were seated we were told that approx 5-6 menu items were not available. The way we were told is that the waiter took a pen and crossed items off of a paper menu, there was no apology or no suggestion of other items to order. I asked the waiter how good the food was and the response I got was \"ehhhh.\" It was clear from the beginning that we were not off to a good start. When it came time to order our mains one member of our party ordered the trout. He was then told after everyone ordered that they were out of trout and more menu items. Another member of our party is Vegan and was told that the vegan item on the menu was out of stock. They made an accommodation by allowing her to get the vegan burger without a bun (as the bun was not vegan). When her meal came it legitimately just a patty. There was no side, no sauce or no toppings, it was fairly pathetic. Another of my friends ordered the carbonera and was told that it wasn't real authentic carbonera. When the food was delivered the waitress dropping it off was clearly uninterested in providing us with service. The food itself was good. Finally when the end of the night came the hostess barged into our igloo and instead of politely asking us to leave and stating that they had closed she exclaimed very rudely that they were closed, we had to leave and they did not have a licence allowing us to there. Mentioning their lack of licence seemed fairly aggressive and absolutely unnecessary considering we had not intention of staying on. This was also particularly interesting considering that when we left the staff were cheering, drinking and getting ready to party. As a result one must ask whether they wanted us to leave due to their lack of licensing requirements or because they wanted to have a staff party. Either way it was quite disappointing. All in all, the glass igloos are a nice experience but this the staff of their restaurant could do with a lesson in customer service.",

Seriously...the dripping Wisteria from the pergolas are enough to stop and sip on some vino while copping the perfect backdrop for your next snapshot. The food and service, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired. I ordered the crispy fried squid and the Flash Steak and Fries. I was impressed by neither. \u00a0Both bland and made me want to ask for hot sauce...something I don't typically do, nor did I. London has been a stunning place to visit, but I've yet to dine in an establishment that knocks my socks off...this one included. Tragic. Service was lackluster as well. There were two other tables around us who also seemed frustrated with the lack of presence from the staff. One customer finally got up to find their server as the other severs scoffed. Not impressed.",

    "text": "I really love dining here, as they have a lovely outside space overlooking the Thames. \u00a0However, they have just changed their setting from igloos to cabanas a couple of days ago, and an outside bar. \u00a0So looked to check it out for lunch.Looks very pretty covered with imitation wisterias and greenery (looks very real), and very comfortable seating with outdoor sofas and wicker armchairs. There is a strip of space heaters above on the structure, but it does not give out much heat, because of the surrounding wisterias, they can only be set as low. \u00a0Blankets were also available for the cooler weather, like today, but when the sun peeped out from the cloudy sky, it was very pleasant. It is always nice eating alfresco, and food seems to tastes better. \u00a0We started with the sticky chorizo sausages with honey, mustard and smoked paprika glaze, and garlic bread. \u00a0All very delicious. Wish the portions were a bit more generous though. \u00a0For mains we ordered the flash steak with watercress and skinny fries, and the corn-fed chicken with lemony rosemary juices,house slaw & skinny fries. \u00a0The steaks came either medium raw or medium well done, although when you asked for medium well done, it came medium raw! \u00a0As steaks go, it was not particularly tasty, very average. \u00a0The chicken, however, was really succulent, tender and very tasty. Do try their Homemade Berry Lemonade with cherry puree, blueberry & blackcurrant cordial, fresh lime and lemonade, or their Orange and Passion Fruit Cooler, with passion fruit, lime,freshly squeezed orange which is very tangy and refreshing but I thought too much ice, and not enough drink. \u00a0However, I much preferred the Elderflower and Mint Limonata with elderflower, fresh lime and mint and soda. A really comfortable and pleasant way to dine, with lovely views, and probably during the summer nights with the night views lit up, the ambiance would probably be even nicer. \u00a0Another reason to come back.",

    "text": "Given that Coppa had mixed reviews of great and horrible reviews, I figured might as well give this place a chance. Unfortunately, I made the wrong choice. Thankfully there was no wait so I'm not as upset- no wait for mediocre food and service. However, the night progressively got worse. So it started off with my friends and I ordering food and wine. The first turnoff was when my friend asked to taste the sauv blanc and the waitress said she couldn't because they only go by bottle, yet the menu had an option to order a glass? So we went with another white that she recommended, just to find out it was all sold out. We then decided to go outside for about 5 minutes and even told her we would be right back we were just taking pictures right outside of the restaurant because they have nice view while we wait for the food. As we got back the food came back with no bottle of wine. She then brought us wine tasting option after the fact that there were no more bottles of her recommendation???! So we chose a bottle of wine to pair with our food, but we waited another 5 minutes until the bottle finally showed up. After that we lost sight of our initial waitress for most of the remainder of our time there. So after that fiasco, my friends and I finally had time to just take our time to eat and chat. Mid chat I get interrupted by another server asking if I was ready? Confused I asked excuse me? She then explained that she was asking me if I was done with my food, mind you I had a decent portion left with plenty of wine left. I politely said no I'm still working on it. A few minutes after another server comes up literally interrupting and asking the same thing?! With this horrible service you would hope for at least decent/good food since it had a spectacular view right?! NOPE. We had the bruschetta, fried squid, penne carbonara, and crab linguine. The bruschetta was soggy and bland(how do you mess up on such a simple dish?), the carbonara was also bland, the linguine was dry with no crab pieces, and I guess the fried squid was the most decent out of the bunch(but I've still had better).I normally don't write this much on yelp, but everything about this place (minus the view- sucha waste) was horrendous. BE AWARE.",

We were able to dine in one & it was very cool. Look forward to trying their cabana next. We started with the truffled fried gnocchi. Pretty good but would be better with a touch of truffle salt. Someone else ordered the bruschetta. It was a very small portion. Impossible to share with more than 2 people. I had the nice house salad starter. Loved the avocado in it & dressing was tasty. For my entree I ordered the 1/2 portion of crab linguini. It was delicious and I regretted not ordering full size portion. \u00a0We went ahead and ordered some bread to go with our dinners. It is phenomenal. I imagine they make their pizzas from the same dough, so I look forward to going back to try one. We had excellent servers. Very friendly & helpful.",
