    "text": "Keeping in tradition with other strange Japanese brand names such as Pepsi Ice Cucumber and Water Salad Shop, the name of Hi Sushi Salsa is a conglomeration of one of my favourite foodstuffs and a Latin dance. The food here is so good that the cleverness of the name actually becomes more apparent: the Salsa bit is only there to describe the dancing of your taste buds across your mouth when you take your first bite. They've got a really nice window display to boot!As you walk in you take in the pleasant, cool and dark surroundings that include a post-modern water fountain and teppan tables. Our order included a 12 piece sashimi dish along with various other sushi platters, and the clear winner of the day: Scottish beef tataki with green leeks. The salads are special too. Though the prices are quite steep at this restaurant, your dining experience will be second to none. When you get up to leave this lovely restaurant, romantically set along the Camden canal, you might just not want to leave.",

    "text": "Three words - All You Can Eat and by gum I can and I did! Hi Sushi is a little out of place in the grunge and grime of Camden lock, but during our six months living there, I was so glad it braved the goths to exist. Inside the door, you walk across a little bridge over a fountain to your seats. At first glance I thought we would be sitting cross legged on a cushion, Japanese style, but there is a hole cut into the floor for you to sit normally. Sweet, I hate eating uncomfortably. We always order the All You Can Eat menu, but there is a huge a la carte selection also. The All You Can Eat option consists of three mini menus. You choose about 6 things from each, tempura, noodles, edamame, miso soup etc, but the only actually All You Can Eat stuff is the sushi, which you can get again and again. The first time we went, we refilled the sushi about twice more. I felt like the blueberry girl from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, nearly had to get the quiet, smiling staff to roll me out the door. Since then we have reigned it in and I noticed that they have put a little warning note on the order sheet, that if you leave a load of food behind you, they will charge you for it. Well I totally agree, there are waif thin teenagers wasting away outside on the Lock and you're in here wasting food like a Sultan... tsk!Can't recommend Hi Sushi enough, I think it's about \u00a313 each for the All You Can Eat option and the food is fantastic. You might want to fast for a few hours first, just to get your moneys worth :-)",

    "text": "On several occasions I have threatened to never come back to this establishment but their fantastic all you can eat deal keeps me coming back. It starts with the staff not offering the \"all you can eat menu\" by default and their general despondent attitude once you resolve to ordering this. The restaurant boasts traditional Japanese low tables which I don't love either.With all this negativity in mind I keep heading back and the reason is that for all the food on offer for just \u00a316.50 I'm willing to take all these setbacks. You can begin with a selection of 8 dishes as \"starters\". There is a fantastic choice from teriyaki to yakitori specialities as well as your expected miso soup and edamame.The sushi selection is limited to 8 selections but is very fresh. The 2 sushi chefs make all the portions on the spot guaranteeing you are getting a good experience. As the night goes on the portions have a tendency of becoming smaller but considering it is an all you can eat menu the really hungry can offset this by ordering moreThe decor is young and funky and loud music is played which isn't a problem for me. They also offer some very tasty and well priced cocktails including several variations of mojitos.To conclude, I'm not sure I would visit this Hi Sushi as often as I did if the price was not so favorable. However it is always nice to be able to fill up properly with decent sushi without having to worry too much about how it will hurt your wallet.",

They have large, sunken in tables to give you that feel of sitting on the floor without the discomfort sitting on the floor, set aside from other tables so you don't feel so bad about being a bit loud. The food is good, lots of tame favourites for the unadventurous, plus a few interesting fusions of Japanese and Latin flavours (yes, the 'Salsa' is for more than just flare). There's a fixed price a la carte menu, again great if you've got a large number of people and want to order a bunch of different things, but can still keep the price reasonable for everyone. They have great cocktails too. Best to make a booking for Friday and Saturday nights as loads of people wander in from the Markets.",

    "text": "Ok, um, WHOA. Hi Sushi Salsa, are you serious?! \u00a317 for all you can eat?!?! Including cooked items like tempura and teriyaki?!?!!? Omigod, I am so excited I can't stop using question marks and exclamation points??!?!?!?!?!?!?!?Ok, this place is crazy. For \u00a317/head (not available on Saturdays), you get all you can eat (with stipulations) Japanese food. They've got a list of sushi and sashimi items that you can have unlimited portions of, as well as a list of cooked items. You order the unlimited stuff as you need/want it by ticking boxes on the little slip of paper where the options are listed, and you order the cooked items all at once, 7 items per couple. We tried to order just a few cooked things--tempura, a green salad, and some curried something--because we were anticipating filling up on sushi, but the waitress said that the portions of hot stuff were rather small and that we should get all 7. I wish we had stuck to our guns and only gotten a few, because it ended up being So! Much! Food! We only had room for a few sushi items after all of the hot stuff, which ended up being an order of salmon sashimi and a few small maki rolls. In the interest of full disclosure, the entire menu is not available for this deal, just a selection of maybe 20-ish cooked items and 15 or so sushi/sashimi options, but everything listed looked absolutely lovely and we had a hard time choosing. Next time, we're going to starve ourselves for the day before we head out to Hi Sushi Salsa, as we didn't have the appetite to take full advantage of the abundance of yummy food. It isn't very often you have someone waving free sashimi in your face. The quality of the fish was, considering the price, quite extraordinary. It would have fit in just fine at other more pricey Camden sushi joints like Bento or Sushi Waka. With buffet or all-you-care-to-eat places like this, it is easy to overlook shoddy quality so long as you feel like you got your money's worth, but Hi Sushi Salsa provided fantastic quality as well as quantity. With service charges and a flask of sake, our bill came to under \u00a350, and I was more pleasantly stuffed than I've ever been on sushi. Well done, Hi Sushi Salsa!",

The sushi is not exactly bottomless as you are only allowed to order certain dishes a fixed number of times, but having said that, my friends and I have never once managed to eat more than we are allowed, though the allowance for the good stuff runs out fairly quickly. If you, like me, are vegetarian, then stick to the ala carte menu as the vegetarian buffet selection is not particularly extensive. Service however is not five-star. During one visit with a group of friends for a birthday do, I was a little offended when the staff refused to let me order from the ala carte menu, implying that I would have my friends (all of whom were having the buffet) to order some food off the buffet menu for me discreetly.

I use quotation marks because it's not exactly all you can eat, as will be explained. We needn't reserve a table, plus every time I've come here it has been pretty quiet. The restaurant is low lit and trendy, and you get to sit on the floor just the way the Japanese do it (well almost). It's not obvious that they serve buffet unless you ask. They then give you a slip of paper where you select what you want to eat from the selection of sushi listed. You can order up to five times. PLUS, they serve a selection of hot Japanese food as well but that can only be ordered once. Now although it's not exactly \"all you can eat\", the platters of sushi succeeded in gratifying 5 sushi lovers! We were beat by the 3rd round! We couldn't go on any longer...

    "text": "After much badgering by my partner, I finally went to Hi Sushi. A group of us went last night and I must admit, I was approaching it with some trepidation - I occasionally will have an Itsu if no other option presents itself, but I'm not absolutely crazy about sushi. On top of that, the Hi Sushi she wanted to go to is in Camden - I really am not a fan of Camden, finding it too alternative for my old man pub drinking tastes, I am glad I did jump out of my comfort zone though for a few reasons.The food is good (I've seen a few people reviewing and complaining that the quality isn't what you expect; if you want \u00a0top end sushi and the price it comes with then go to Roka. To complain about quality of sushi at a place that has an all you can eat option is really narrow-minded and expecting way too much) and really is plentiful. The one-off dishes that you can order add a really nice splash of variety to the standard sushi that I'm certainly used to from Itsu, and the atmosphere really is cool, with a few animes in the background, good music and the oft-mentioned seating in the floor (I admit it completely threw me at first, raised more than a few laughs from our party). The staff, whilst on occasion a little bit wayward with their attention, were really friendly when they were on hand, even giving you some joking encouragement to keep eating into the third platter they brought out ('is he your boyfriend? I wouldn't bring him next time, he really isn't helping you and your friends finish this lot off! maybe bring another girl') They really did want you to get your moneys worth.All in all, I really enjoyed the food (especially the price) and the atmosphere at Hi Sushi, and whilst I won't be rushing back to the one in Camden (because it's in Camden more than anything else) I will certainly recommend it to family and friends and will be locating the nearest one to me in either Wapping or Kings Road.",

The decoration as soon as you walk in is amazing with the bridge and small river under The sushi chefs are all in a drop down kitchen as soon as you walk into the restaurant. I love the unique seating here with the \"drop down\" tables and there is lots of leg space under the table. Whenever I order sashmi, the fish always tastes really fresh, no matter the time of day I come here. All the fruity cocktails here is also really good and are the perfect amount of sweetness for my liking. The service here is quick, though sometimes all the other food will come out and the rolls take a lot longer which is awkward when in a group and everyone else is waiting for you to get your food so they can all begin eating, but I can't really fault anyone for that Sushi Salsa has become my go to place to satisfy my sushi craving whenever I'm in London.",

The buffet is \u00a318.80 and you get one round of hot food (5 items, we got fried salmon, calamari skewers, fried calamari, shrimp tempura, and gyoza), 1 order of specials (another 5 items, we got clam sashimi, prawn nigiri, and some other nice items...), and then 5 rounds of regular sushi (5 items each, for 5 people they gave us 18 pieces per item). The hot food and the specials went well, then we were amazed at the amount of food for the regular sushi. I think the best value of the ordinary items is the salmon sashimi, where they just pile fresh salmon, but 18 pieces of the actual sushi is really difficult to finish. It's fairly ordinary stuff, like a California roll, or a spicy tuna roll, but nothing spectacular. It was a good meal after 1 round of the regular sushi, but we really struggled to eat much on the 2nd round. But of course, they charge \u00a35/person for food wastage, and we got told off by the waitress when we asked for our bill, so we put in our best efforts and maybe left like 10 pieces on various plates. Overall, I think these things are fun once in a while, but the fun stops when you have to force feed yourself, so be warned about the large portions that come with the regular sushi.",

They give you two menus \u00a0- a hot one that you can order once from, and a cold sushi one that you can order from 7 times!!!! The hot food was banging and the sushi hit the spot completely. The waiters are just kind of there. They take the little order cards and occasionally walk by so you can flag one down for a drink, but the service isnt why you're there. The table next to us were getting all kinds of yummy looking things from the regular menu, so i may have to splurge some time and go back. for \u00a340, we each had a drink and enough food to roll us through to the next day.Colour me happy.",

I wouldn't want to pay any lower as I wouldn't want to compromise on the quality of ingredients!Other great bonuses of this restaurant are the sunterrace by the canal that gives it that awsome \"only in London\" feel making it an absolut haven for the summer times and on Saturdays when they have DJs palying, it's just perfect to set the mood before heading out to Clubland.On the downside are the overeager staff that have been moulded into robots of the table turning conveyor belt mentality, reining supreme in the restaurant industry in London today. Forgive them father, they do not know better. They do achieve absolution with great ambiance and food though so personally, I'm good.",

When we arrived the lady at the door rudely told us there was no table.- We were told we could only stay for an hour and 15 minutes, annoying as we were there for a birthday meal, although they told us even people with bookings are only allowed to stay for an hour and a half!- Ordering from the all you can eat menu was SO complicated, there are some really weird rules on only ordering certain things once, being able to double up on other things and only choosing a set number of different dishes for the table.- Some of the sushi came COVERED in bright orange mayonnaise... Gross.- The hot squid dish we had tasted old and was really chewy.- Sorry, the music was too loud... and terribleThings I do like:- The sushi and sashimi without the orange gunk tasted surprisingly fresh!- The tempura was actually pretty good, not too greasy and not soggy at all.- The ambiance (bar the music) was cool, I love how they've decorated the place.- You can eat all you like... sashimi.- THE PRICE THE PRICE THE PRICE!!!!!!!!!!",

However, we enjoy the 'all you can eat' sushi deal, so we went back for a friend's birthday this past Sunday. The staff were completely unhelpful and rude when we asked for two separate order forms for such a large group and then demanded that people who weren't taking part in the buffet (soon to become known as the lucky ones) sit away from the rest of the buffet eaters.However, we decided to stay there as we were excited about the buffet and did not want to ruin our friend's birthday meal.Of the 14 people who attended the dinner, EIGHT are now suffering from horrible food poisoning. This includes both fish eaters and vegetarians. I am posting this because this should not be ignored and I hope my comments will influence others to eat somewhere else! Bento Cafe is very near by on Parkway and is delicious and fresh with friendly staff. My suggestion is to eat there instead.Be warned!",

    "text": "This review if for the AYCE aspect only. The regular hand rolls are comparable to those sold at Tesco Express in the deli section. In terms of value, you pick 5 items by filling in a bubble. The staff then makes the decision how much to bring you based on the number of people in your party. Another gentlemen orders the AYCE and his portions that were brought seemed the same as our portions for 2 people. Perhaps living in So Cal we are spoiled with the abundance of fresh fish and fantastic AYCE \u00a0restaurants. We thought we would give it a try and we did. Box checked, won't return.Other Concerns: 1) Sitting on the floor: Initially, this is cool I thought. Then I saw the frowning face of the wait staff who has to literally bend over to take your order etc. Had a couple spills of water and sauce as a result of this bending. Also, watch your fingers as they may be stepped on. I also saw a wait staff trip over a seat cushion. Good thing she wasn't carrying hot tea. Finally, I found it challenging to get up again at the end of the meal. I could just image the added issues if I had some saki or other drinks. Yikes!2) Welcoming Environment: I didn't feel very welcomed when I cane in. No one said goodbye when I left either. 3) Bill: Price is now 23 pounds for AYCE. Comparable to the states with regards to price, but that is where the comparison ends.",

    "text": "This review is for \"All you can eat\" at Sushi Salsa:Here is how it works - within 1.5 hours, you get 5 rounds of sushi with up to 5 items each round. You also get one round to order up to 7 hot food items and one round to order other special sushi items.All orders are made according to the number of people in the group. The sushi isn't the best but it's pretty fresh for all you can eat. My favorite item from the all you can eat menu was the salmon sashimi and my least favorite was the salmon skin roll - the fried salmon skin was too soggy. There's also a pretty good selection for hot items but they can be filling! I recommend the shrimp tempura and agedashi tofu. One of my complaints is for the spicy rolls. These are prepped and cut the same way regular rolls are, but served with spicy mayo on top of each piece. I would've liked it more if the spicy mayo was mixed with the fish first then rolled and cut into individual pieces.Besides that, everything else was satisfactory! The staff were attentive despite how large and busy the restaurant was. They constantly refilled our teas and waters, removed our empty plates and were timely to take our orders.Overall, Sushi Salsa doesn't serve the best sushi in town but it definitely does a pretty good deal for all you can eat considering the price and the quality of the fish. I'd recommend this place for strictly that.",

We went for the all you can eat buffet which is \u00a319.80 for 1.5 hrs which doesn't seem cheap but it is compared to what you get. We were 3 people and you can order 5 rounds of sushi choosing 5 different types of sushi each time. The sushi is freshly prepared then and tastes amazing! In addition to that you can order 7 other dishes which were really good too. In the beginning you might think it won't be enough but we didn't come further then round 3 of 5 before we almost rolled out of there. The atmosphere is really nice and there are two open kitchens. The staff is really friendly and welcoming. They charge you if you leave to much food behind but I think that's a good thing to do, know your limits! As I loved the place and the sushi, I will definitely return!",

    "text": "We came here on a date night a few months ago but neither of us were quite hungry enough to stuff ourselves with sushi, so decided to try the Ramen instead. I might still come back to fill my belly with all you can eat sushi another day.Awesome-sauce:- It looks nice. I like the dug in tables in Japan, but haven't seen them in the UK- The menu is quite extensive and not too pricey- My (slightly strange sounding) tonkatsu ramen was interesting. It was a bit like a mixture of katsudon and ramen.Less impressive:- It's not uber-authentic and seems to be run by Chinese staff (you can see the notices to staff are all in Chinese.) this isn't a biggy, just don't expect to order in Japanese.- The ramen were a bit too squishy and the broth was a bit salty. I've had far better in LondonPro tip: \u00a0If there is no 'tabehodai' (all you can eat menu), just ask for it.",

It is a big, fancy, corporate looking restaurant. It holds a lot of people too. It is not cheap and not that small \"Japanese\" style sushi place I like. Kind of cold and busy. But the menus were odd and extensive but I've enjoyed other sushi restaurants in the area more. I'm not saying the food isn't good, just that the atmosphere could be a bit more enticing.",

The main let down was the service of the staff there. I understand that many will not agree with me but sometimes when I dine, I like the relax friendly feel to the people who are working there and it really disappoints me the staff are very mundane and of course I don't expect them to jump around like circus animals!When we ordered, the waitress had the biggest frown and when she met our ways put a 1 second smile. when they served the food on the plate they didn't land it in front of us but slid it like a dog bowl and the soup even spilt. No eye contact and just quick serving ready to get rid of us. My boyfriend put the plate to one side and it was clear it wasn't finish because we put it on our side and the woman bent forward to pick it up just before my boyfriend started to reach for the plate to finish it. we felt embarrassed to stop her because she was so quick and didn't ask us if we were finished at all.",
