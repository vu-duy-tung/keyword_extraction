    "text": "The American Diner touts itself as a good old-fashioned diner like Pop's in Archie comics. To a certain extent it does achieve it's aim especially in the menu. The decor and layout seems a little posh to be a diner though. Still, it's a nice place to eat and is near the shopping heavens of Oxford Street and Regent Street, not to mention Carnaby Street. It's a fairly large restaurant with plenty of seating and a nice little area at the back with natural lighting. The service is also quite friendly and helpful. The food - which is the main bit - is good though not exceptional. Perhaps we just ordered the wrong things, but the breakfasts did not seem like anything to write home about. The pancakes the people next to us were having looked fabulous though. A special mention for the milkshakes - they are gorgeous, sinful and have about 50000 calories in them! Not only that, a single milkshake order comes in a jug with enough for 3 glasses! Not for the faint hearted or the dieters of this world.",

A few people have commented below about the quality of the burgers. They certainly weren't the best burgers you'll ever have but my decision to go with a chilli burger seems to have paid off because I thought it was great. Perhaps the chilli overpowered the taste I also like the fact that they gave a choice of how you wanted it cooked. Not enough burger places do that here in the UK. The sides on offer here are great. We had skinny fries and onion rings but from what we could see on other tables, everything looked good. And then the drinks There's no way I would've gone near an alcoholic milkshake that contained JD and peanut butter unless I'd already've had a few light ales. But I'm glad I did. Alcoholic milkshakes are the way to go and I hope to see more of them on menus elsewhere in London! Little side note about the toilets: blue for boys, pink for girls. We had fun laughing people get that wrong But then as I said above, them alcoholic milkshakes were gooood.",

Sadly, those days are gone \u00a0the hipster vibe is getting more pronounced, and nowhere is this more evident than in the completely lackadaisical service provided, in exchange for a 12.5% service charge. With that said, if you don't care how your food is served to you, it is pretty good. There's a decent range on offer, and the milkshakes are excellent. Toilet facilities are average, and the place gets busy particularly at weekends, so you might have to wait for a table. The food is probably worth it, but the service isn't.

The first time I went (ashamed it wasn't my last), and for reasons beyond understanding, I ended up ordering a waffle concoction from their blue plate menu. Unlike normal waffle meals, it was topped with bacon and cream, or some equally disgusting waffle combination, which normal waffles would shun. Needless to say, the rest of the evening was spent feeling rather sad, dirty and cheated. Luckily the portions are so so tiny, there's no risk of any permanent damage. The second time I found myself at this place, I had something Taco (or burrito?) related; so average I'm struggling to remember. On my third \u00a0and so far final \u00a0visit, I ordered a cheeseburger. Again, a safe option and very average tasting BUT, who serves burgers without fries?!",

You can eat indoors in booths or outdoors and people watch, of which ive done both. A huge choice of food too, it took ages for us all to decide our order, the waiters/waitress are helpful and friendly. Dont leave without trying one of the alcoholic milkshakes, there are a good view to choose from, or order a regular flavour and add a shot of your choice. I went for the Colonel Parker, with peanut butter and Jack Daniels among other ingredients. Ive had burgers both times, just about finished them, but the chili fries defeated me, as tasty as they were, i was just too full. One of my friends had one of the all day breakfasts and found that delicious. Would visit again, but maybe one of the other locations this time, there are another 2 in London i believe. Good location too, just off Carnaby St.",

I've been a few times because I don't like to judge somewhere on their first attempt only... but it doesn't quite match up. First thing they need to fix are the burgers. Sure, they might be a reasonable price but they really aren't very good. The fries, however are world class. They dress the servers up in old american diner style outfits, but they are usually unfriendly and from eastern europe which sort of kills the vibe you're expecting in this place. There are some good things - it's usually mostly empty so you can get a comfy seat, and they offer alcoholic milkshakes including one genius unlikely sounding combination of bourbon, ice cream and peanut butter. Sounds pretty awful and my friend from Birmingham laughed at me when I ordered it, then tried it and said it might be the best dessert he'd ever tried. So go for that, but if you want food you're better off eating at the Soho Pizzeria down the bottom of Carnaby street.",

The food does take quite a while to come considering the simplicity of it, and we were there very early in the evening so it wasn't really busy at all. I went for eggs Benedict and it was just average. The Hollandaise was a bit thick and tasted too buttery for my liking. The mushroom burger looked pretty good though and came with some Cajun sauce but when we asked for some more we got given seafood sauce... odd. The hot-dog was very simple and a bit overpriced. We were served by 3 different people overall which isn't ideal and one of our waitresses had just had a tattoo and had her arm covered in plastic... might have wanted to cover that up while you're serving people food. On the plus side the music was pretty good. Note: the fried portions are huge, we could have shared 1 portion between the 3 of us.",

Lumberjack's breakfast (pancakes, eggs, bacon, syrup) tastes delicious and really hits the spot. Mmmmmm. And the alcoholic milkshakes were deliciously dessert like. I added sausages to my breakfast which I would NOT reccommend doing. I expected proper sausages (perhaps that is an english expectation, but got 3 little cocktail sausage things which I thought was overpriced and lame.The service was friendly but sort of lazy. I was feeling relaxed and unbothered about this but my boyfriend got a bit irate so depends on your mood.And it is a little pricey, but for me, affordable as a treat.

This is sort of true you could get breakfast if you wanted it but other than that you had the options between burgers or the wonderful American corndog. Seeing that I am not into hot dogs \u00a0,I decided to go for the burger. The burger was good and cooked nicely. The chips that I had ordered were average (but they gave you a lot). First off the part about breaking your wallet for my whole meal which included: diet coke, chips and a burger game out to 12 pounds. For 12 pounds I could of eaten at McDonalds about 3 times. But I guess I need to remember that this is London and not some small hick town diner in the US.The decor was a mix between Mexican and disco. The music was good expect for the fact we were sitting close to one of the speakers. The service wasn't great, but not horrible either. It was our servers first night ever working. So overall I think if I had a choice between The Diner or McDonalds, I would most likely go for a Big Mac and fries for a third of the price.",

Burger was good (my dining companion doesn't like pickle so I lucked out) and the food was alright. I like the mock diner thing - but old American movies make me smile. If i wasn't a fan (and secretly hoping someone would jump up and sing a number from Grease on the bar) then I think the whole thing would have been lost on me. Service was friendly but inoffensive. Food was good (great if you're hungover) but nothing to shout about. But I do like it. And I like that the burgers are only about \u00a36 - MUCH cheaper dinner than GBK. I think they deserve more than three stars, but they're good, not great. Perhaps if I'd had a milkshake instead of attempting hair of the dog with a beer, the rating might be slightly higher.

Now, you've just been away on holiday to California for three weeks with your best friend, and you make a hungover trip to Soho on a Sunday lunchtime to relive those awesome American breakfast moments. Maybe a breakfast burrito, some blueberry pancakes or eggs benedict. Now hold that image in your mind, with the palpable excitement of getting some proper slap-up yankee grub in central London. The disappointment is that the guts of The Diner are unflinchingly British: - the portions are tiny, especially for the price, and certainly for what's supposed to be an American diner- the service is slow, inattentive and aloof. A bit like being served by a bunch of disinterested, overdressed hipsters who would rather be hanging out drinking vermouth in a Hoxton hairdressers or something.- the food is about 70% authentic. So I would not recommend it for breakfast. However, the burgers and fries are perfectly serviceable. The decor is naff but comfortable and in this neck of the woods, there aren't many good mid-priced joints to choose from. Oh, and the coffee was the only thing better on this side of the Atlantic.",

I'm afraid I can't really comment on the rest of the menu, as no matter what time I rock up to the diner, I just can't help but go for the breakfast fare. But I can tell you that the service is alright, the decor is quite fun and the milkshakes are pretty good. But the real benefit of a trip to The Diner Soho is getting to enjoy everything that's brilliant about American breakfasts but in portions just under half the size.",

The service is SO slow- why on earth did it take 45 minutes for my hot dog and onion rings to reach the table during a semi-busy lunch time? 45 minutes?! I couldn't believe it. The hot dog was fine but the onion rings were horrible- very greasy with dark brown bread crumbs (I am a massive fan of onion rings and was really let down by these)The staff are very friendly (and attractive) but the atmosphere isn't very \u00a0exciting. Whilst I can see why they steered away from overtly retro decor, like at Eds, they could have made it a bit more fun, like at Lucky 7's. \u00a0Their Curtain Road branch is a lot better, but this one doesn't feel any different to a Gourmet Burger Kitchen.",

The front part of the Diner has a bar also, and the decor is quite dark. I especially love the all black tiles in the toliet - although you need to guess which toilets to go in - they are colour identified! Blue for boys Red for girls, its fun to watch people get this wrong though! Food is not amazing, but what you would probably expect from an Actual American diner and prices reflect the quality of food. There is quite a big selection, including all day breakfast options, such as pancakes & eggs and bacon. An ideal place to eat if you fancy something unhealthy and greasy. Also do great milkshakes, including alcoholic varities, and my favourite Dr. Pepper. I have also never had a problem getting seated in the evenings and Saturday lunch here. It is a cheapish and cheerful place to catch up with friends.",

My extra dill pickles and fried onions hamburger was juicy, super beefy and if you like alot of toppings like me a bit sloppy - in a good way. I steered clear of the alcoholic milkshakes - not sure my taste buds are into bourbon, peanut butter and other strange combos. The fries and onion rings are also worth mentioning, tasty indeed.The interior holds no surprises, thankfully they haven't gone OTT on 50' kitsch, booths come as standard. We had to wait for a table, but sat at the bar and had a drink - all very civilised. There are better all american 'diner' experiences out there, but the burgers hold there own, on the pricey side, but the service in particular our waitress was great. I will return.",

If you don't wanna completely pig out but wanna feel like you've been done justice, get the Taco Salad! It's a salad, but it's in a Taco and has a lot of meat. So it's better than a salad and more pious than a burger or hot dog or what have you! The \"hard\" milkshakes are my weak spot, all the milkshakes are generously poured and you can literally just go there for a shake with a mate and it will be worth your while. The all-day breakfasts are great too. Like, everything's great, nothing too adventurous but you're guaranteed to find something you'll like.The staff are always hip and friendly and one even charged my phone for me behind the bar on a quiet afternoon (not the wisest thing to do, because this is London and people are wiley and beady-eyed, but I was desperate!)",

Being from California, the fare was on par to the 101 Cafe, with a mix between burgers, Mexican, etc. Unfortunately, there were was a noticeable fault - the Onion gravy fries were runny.

For me its the ultimate comfort food!!The chili here is exactly right with the right amount of ratio of chunky meat and kidney beans which is mixed together with a \u00a0mildly spicy sauce that is then poured over fat chips (thin fries are also available) which is then topped up with real cheese and not that liquid kind which i loathe.The other item off the menu i can recommend is the butterfly Cajun chicken which is a favourite of my friend this does not come with fries but the prices here are so reasonable that ordering fires on the side wont cost you the value of a main.Its a very standard diner style restaurant which sometimes can be great if your looking for a casual, relaxed place to eat.",

Being told we had a 30 minute wait for a table should have been enough to deter us but no, we stuck with it, all the way to a disappointing end. Actually, the experience was disappointing throughout, not just at the end.Besides being unnecessarily dimly lit - providing a slight safety concern as there are some low steps that start and end rather abruptly - The Diner is not a particularly pleasant place to be. It's very busy and has the atmosphere of a large children's' party which is at the height of excitement, except, there aren't many children present.As for the food itself, it's a little unimpressive. My chicken burger was a bit smaller than I expected considering it cost nearly \u00a37 (that's just the burger, chips are sold separately). Also, the burger wasn't a particularly good chicken burger as the chicken was difficult to taste. I could taste a lot of Sage but not a lot of chicken. A Sage burger with a hint of chicken would be a more appropriate name for what I received. Not completely awful but certainly not of a good standard.So, dark and decorated in a faux-American diner style (hence the name) with pictures of deceased American celebrities such as Elvis and Kurt Cobain hanging on the walls, because we need visual aids to explain to us all just what America is exactly.They serve beer and other alcoholic drinks but I don't think even they can make a good time here.Nevermind,Ian",

The staff are dressed and made up with the 50s look as well, though they're young and attractive so it's cool rather than mawkish and vaguely depressing. The food is as one would expect; hot dogs, burgers etc. The lunch/dinner food is good though not exceptional, although the bar has a good beer selection. Instead, it is best to come for the breakfasts which are well-done, and perfect if you are a little worse for wear.",

I think they literally had 3 people taking orders, bussing tables and seating people. My first diner experience was in Soho with my sister. Had I known about this place the day before I would have taken my best friend there who was visiting instead of settling on the place next door (utter crap - DO not go to that place to the right of the diner).I had already feasted at Yauatcha a few hours before so decided on a coke float (how many places serve that?! I love it) and my sister had a slice of their apple pie which was more like apple cake really. Not bad, but not great.My second experience was in Camden. This time I was ready to chow down and man did I. My ultimate favourite diner food when I lived in New York for college was the 'lumberjack' breakfast. This consists of 3 short stack pancakes (think American BIG portion pancake circumference here), eggs and bacon with a huge dousing of maple syrup...heaven. The Diner serves just that - on a lovely big plate of goodness. They have everything from Mac and Cheese to Corn Dogs to Huevos Rancheros to French Toast. If you're craving some stodgy good ol' American diner food, this is the place for you. Prices were okay, not too different from what I would expect in London and you will definitely leave stuffed.The downside is the service and lack of Oreo shake on their menu! Had this been a real reflection of the American diner I would love for it to be open all night long with jukeboxes at each red booth.",

I'd recommend it for brunch, as the eggs are lovely and they have a nice variety of pancakes. There is free wifi (maybe so wifi-enabled qypers can write their reviews live?) and a hilarious cocktails menu. I have yet to try a single cocktail, however, as I always stop at the milkshakes. The hazelnut one is to die for. Really. And not only they bring you a massive glass? They also bring you the metallic container with the left-over ice cream and milk mixture in it!! So you get nearly 2 glasses worth. It is delicious!! It's definitely worth a visit if you're hungry and around Carnaby street. One afternoon I went there with some friends and we only had milkshakes. The staff were very friendly and didn't encourage us to leave at all!! I was very impressed.",

(Even though last time I went they were out of rootbeer. But they APOLOGIZED profusely, so it was fine. I forgave and had a Coke instead.)",

I went with a group and we all got a burger of some sort. I ordered the original burger medium rare. It was pretty good. Kinda small and I finished it pretty fast. I love that there isnt any tax it london so you pay what you see on the menu. The fries are a joke however, they are small, dry, and they dont give you alot. We sat in this underground area which was kinda cool. Not sure id come back again though.",

    "text": "Although I'm not entirely pleased with the food here (more on that later), my main issue is with the terrible service. \u00a0I used to come here once in a while if I was in the area and had a hankering for some cheese fries, and put up with the long wait times as part of the experience (though obviously, they're not part of an authentic diner experience). \u00a0However, the last time I was here, service was so appalling I doubt I'll ever return. \u00a0In addition to being ignored for a good 10 minutes after you walk in the door (which happens every time), we were then placed in the tiniest booth I'd ever seen, even though the restaurant was practically empty. \u00a0I politely asked if we could sit in a slightly larger booth nearby instead, and the server copped quite an attitude. I guess because of this, she didn't return to take our order for 30 minutes, and that was only after I flagged her down. \u00a0Her response, said with a sneer, \"Oh, were you ready to order?\" \u00a0We then had to wait an hour to actually receive our breakfasts (bearing in mind there were only three other tables full in the entire place), and when we got them, they were cold, and she had forgotten my fries, which didn't arrive until after I'd finished eating everything else. \u00a0We never received an apology for this incredibly crappy service. So, the food. \u00a0Coming from an American, I would definitely class this place as a typical British bastardisation of American culture. \u00a0I've only ever had breakfast here, since I don't eat meat, and don't ever get a hankering for weird vegetarian tacos. \u00a0The pancakes are particularly disappointing. \u00a0They are tiny (generally pancakes take up an entire plate, unless specified as silver dollars) and are something I could make much better myself, even just using Bisquick. \u00a0The French Toast is also not great, though edible. \u00a0Their milkshakes suffer from the same malady as every milkshake I've had in this country, thin, thin, thin. \u00a0Do people ever even use actual ice cream in milkshakes here? \u00a0The only things I really liked here is the cheese fries, mainly because I prefer skinny fries to chips, and they don't use that horrible orange cheese sauce like most places in America, or at Ed's Diner. \u00a0Ick. \u00a0I also appreciate that they offer orange soda (other than Fanta), but it's not a great example of its type. \u00a0They would have been better off going with Stewarts, or even just Orange Crush or something. \u00a0So to sum up, terrible service, ok food. \u00a0Maybe if they hire someone who isn't a disinterested hipster, I'll consider coming back, eventually.",

Not only was our ridiculously priced burgers cold but our ridiculously small \u00a35.00 chilli cheese fries were too. Even at \u00a38.00 a burger, fries are not included. To make things worse, when we received our bill there was a \u00a33.50 service charge added. When I can hands down say that was the worse service I've ever had. Basically a lazy group of unprofessional looking 25 year olds moping around. Disgusting. Just as I was happy to be leaving one of the staff members, as we were stood under the shelter putting our coats on said \"I know it's raining but move out the way\"......Not acceptable.",

    "text": "So, you'll be horrified to know that some of my friends who have lived in London all their life, and they've never ventured down Carnaby street. (Oh, the horror) That could be down to two reasons. 1) Clearly, I have far too much time on my hands when I should've been studying.2) I'm secretly a hipster (not so much a secret now...)So it's like WE HAD TO GO, I mean there is no choice, I MUST show them a whole new world, like aladdin and jasmine on their magic carpet ride. I mean, it's SUCH a hard life. (I kid!) So my birthday rolled along and I dragged them along to try out the hard shakes and the burgers.I'm not going to lie, I never even looked at the food part of the menu. I saw HARD SHAKES and I was already sold. I mean. Bourban and peanut Butter. WIN. and do you know what else is win? They give you a scoop of peanut butter on the side of your milkshake container. What's not win. The gherkins were pretty rubbish. they didn't have a POW that cut through the immense amount of meat. I ordered the arch burger which has a pulled pork topping. ( Yes, I'm going through a pulled pork binge these days, AND WHAT?!) The burger started off well, but it didn't keep me going. I think I'm jaded after burger quest. I left half my burger and just ate off the pulled pork topping. To be fair, the burger was PRETTY ginormous. I wasn't wowed by The Diner but it's a sound 3 stars. And I'm sorry, the gherkins are pretty damn crucial.",

I shall tell you, but in case you've already guessed, it was The Diner. Choice made easier by the way since a friend I was with had a burger craving.Quick service (9pm) we each plumped for an expected cheeseburger and milkshake, splitting some fries. My medium rare burger was actually medium, but I forgave the friendly (if a tad slow) waitress this since it was totally yummy. Sweet potato fries are a must here and cheese skinnies were a good option too. The triumph of the menu here are the shakes, especially the hard ones. A hard shake, I hear you exclaim? Why yes dear reader, hard in this case means laced with a generous dollop of alcohol. I had a brandy Alexander (an old favourite) which was nicely flavoured with Nutella and chocolate pieces. Minus top marks here for price (\u00a37 burger is great hut you can get a better burger at better price at Grillshack) but all in all, a definite recommendation. Leaving whilst they were playing 'Gold Dust' was the icing note cake - top top however, don't mosh when full. Lots of burping ensues.",

    "text": "You know when service and food are so terrible that you literally use the establishment's own WiFi to download the Yelp App and write the review while you are sitting waiting... Let me start by saying that I grew up in the food industry and in family owned restaurant businesses I am happy to endorse the places that need to be recognized for their excellent customer service and commitment to food quality, however, this place is not one of them. After spending a few weeks in Istanbul, we were craving a taste of home. So off to the American inspired diner! From start as we walked in, the host couldn't seem to be bothered to show us a table. When we asked to be seated away from the cold door he acted annoyed. So we weren't especially being ingratiated with welcomes or even average rate service. Next we waited...15 mins. When the waiter finally came to our table, we found out they were out of the items we came for, but no worries we informed them of my dairy allergy anyway. \u00a0After we ordered, the waiter came back three times to ask questions about my simple order of two eggs, an English muffin with peanut butter, a sausage patty, and some tater tots. The waiter said the cook wouldn't clean the area where they fry the sausage and that they would have cross contamination for the tater tots. I assured them that I could have the tater tots. Then we waited...again. 25 mins. We asked for drinks--water and milkshakes for the children. They brought two waters for our party of four. We had to ask for the other two waters and they seemed annoyed. This wasn't a high volume time but a 2 pm lunch. The restaurant was empty--only three other covers. Thirty minutes later we got out food: a plate of three eggs, an insipid gluten free muffin, and a side of tahini. When I asked about my order they seemed confused. Then the wait staff, who didn't have anything else to do, hovered near our table and used foul language (the f word, etc) near our 7 & 9 year old. Then we finished/picked at our disappointing food (no taste of home here), and asked for the check. And we waited... Again. I can see the waiter and host and bartender are sitting together just talking about nothing. So after another ten minutes we asked again. No apologies or anything were offered. Do not eat here. There are so many unique and amazing restaurants in London. This not our usual go-to but we thought it would be fun to take in a more tacky/campy place but this wasn't it.",

    "text": "The Diner is one of those places that feels american to people who have not been in America. That is probably due to the fact they have stuck everything American they could find in the decor and somehow booths have to make it authentic, right? Despite that I can not say I was disappointed with my visit there. The first time I went was a Saturday night when it was quite busy but my friend let me know that they do alcoholic milkshakes and I'm never one to turn down alcohol and Oreos. Now, you will say that the oreo shake is not one of their 'hard' shakes on the menu, but fear not, just ask them to make it so and they will. Then I thought I should go back during the day and try some of the food. I was quite intrigued by the Californian burger with guacamole and while not being the best burger ever it was pretty decent. Since my friend and I thought that it was very American to get a lot of food we ordered the sweet potato fries, the cheesy fries and the onion rings as sides. Both of the fries were amazing (I absolutely love fries) and the onion rings were all right. I let my other friend in the oreo milkshake secret and she lived it as well and overall we had a pretty good time. I do want to go back to try the corndogs as I've never tried those before but in terms of burgers you can find better ones elsewhere.",

Generally if I go to the diner it's because I want some food, don't want to wait too long and don't have any specific cravings (or I'm cravings burgers etc). They do a bunch of different things, so pretty much anybody will find something they like. They give you loads of food (share chips). They do a great range of drinks (milkshakes are awesome, as is the juniper pale ale). If you're in the area and need a refuel I would recommend this place. It's just a straight forward food place. Nothing fancy, not too expensive, but it does what it does pretty well. You may have noticed quite a lot of non committal language so far. That's on purpose. It's good. It's not amazing. You might have to queue a little bit (location location location...) and the food is good but it won't change your life.",

    "text": "Being from New Jersey and all I know a thing or two about diners. After a failed attempt to pay a visit to a closed Mother Mash, we found ourselves at a diner simply known as The Diner.We were promptly seated with our drink order taken. Without hesitation, we decided to try London's own Camden Town Brewery's Hells Lager and Wheat beers respectively. We then proceeded to order an Arch Burger (topped with puled pork and monterey jack cheese), Diner Mac and Cheese, and Wet Fries (fries covered in brown gravy). Don't judge. Everything was delicious and just like after a night of drinking, we soon regretted consuming the high number of calories that we had when everything was said and done. As far as selection, quality, and drinks go, I was very impressed with The Diner. On the other hand, the service was quick and efficient, but almost a little invasive. My guess is that our server was getting off her shift and was trying to hurry us out as soon as she could. Every two minutes, she was clearing our plates, asking if we were finished, and watching us like a hawk. I know what you're thinking and no, they were not getting ready to close. I know this because there were still many other people in the restaurant and even a few that walked in as we were nearing the end of our stay. So in conclusion, The Diner is an excellent option if you are looking to dive into some comfort food and wash it down with a grand selection of beer, cocktails, or even hard milkshakes in a very laid back, relaxing atmosphere. For a diner, that is not in America, or the Garden State for that matter, they are a solid option.",

    "text": "For the last few weeks, there has been nothing I've wanted to eat more than a wonderful, American corndog. So I searched throughout London, found this American style diner, and went twice. I went the second time to make sure it wasn't just a bad day for the restaurant and the corndogs were in fact trash. Nope, they're not real corn dogs. They're hot dogs that have been breaded a bit. Nowhere near the kind of corndog I'm used to. I went with a few Brits who have tried them in America and they agreed with me that those were not real corndogs. Now, you might say 'Wow this chick is crazy'. Well, I very well might be. But the rest of the experience didn't make up for it so I was left feeling really underwhelmed. The rest of the food was fine. Not great, but it was food. I asked for a glass of tap water because my bloody mary was seriously peppery, and it came 25 minutes later. My friend asked for a refill on his drink at the same time and he had to ask again when my water came. I would rather crawl into a hole and die before waving at a server or snapping my fingers to get their attention. But considering how long it took me to get any server (not even my table's!) to make eye contact with me so I could ask for a straw I could have walked to a corner store and bought one in a shorter time. It's fine, if you are looking for American food to feed the craving it'll do, but it's not the best and there was always something a bit different with the food. I'm going to continue my hero's journey for corndogs though.",

Haven't eaten or drank much water today, and we were in a mission for some fish and chips. Well, turns out we failed in that department, and we stumbled in this place because we were so damn hungry. I ordered the The Diablo burger, and holy hell of name of the devil in Espa\u00f1ol... it is to die for!! Don't let the name fool you... no heat whatsoever. This thing was huge in presentation and even better in taste. It HAS to be the pickles that make the taste buds explode and pop in the mouth! I ordered a side of their tater tots... I kid you not, it is the best tasting tots I've ever had. It's almost borderline of a tot and fried hash brown. Big and crispy in size. So perfect to quench the hunger pangs (hangry) of my wife and my happy go lucky and lost in London friend . I definitely recommend this hidden little gem, which yes, serves American style cuisine, but damn, they just about do it better than home. Enjoy walking through the shops, grab some beers from some local pubs in Carnaby, and stop by for some tasty food!",

    "text": "Yet again, my friends and I found ourselves indulging in another place's culture... and going to an American restaurant. They did us average justice. I was in love with the vibe and ambiance of this restaurant. The hanging lights were cool, and the theme was really interesting. The music was good too, but it was rather loud. The booth we were seated in was a bit cramped for six people, but it was still okay.Casey was our server, and he was real nice and patient. Almost all of my friends ordered the shakes, and they were dangerously delicious. I certainly would recommend the Oreo Shake. One of my friends ordered a margarita, and it was pretty expensive and not a big glass, so be weary. It was also very strong, so, again, be weary. I ordered the Freakshow Chicken, and it tasted a lot better when I first tried it than when I was finishing my meal. It was a pretty small serving for being an acclaimed dinner basket. I switched out the hot sauce for their famous sauce, and I was happy with that choice. When I asked for an additional sauce, which by the way was an extremely tiny little paper cup, I wasn't told that I would be charged a whole pound for it, which really upset me. One person in my group was vegan and said there were lots of options. She had a vegan vanilla shake and thought it was only acceptable. Apparently there's way better out there. Two in our group got cheeseburgers and said it tasted like something from McDonalds. They were also disappointed that it didn't come with fries or really any side. Another got mac & cheese and fries. She thought the fries were good, but the mac & cheese could have used more cheese. She did say that, for a side, it was a lot of food. The egg on a muffin was the last thing our group ordered, and my friend really enjoyed it. I'll say, it is great that breakfast is served all day. Ultimately, prices were decent and so was the food, so I think I'll give this restaurant three stars and I'll also be holding a grudge about that sauce.",

This was an inspired suggestion by my guy after a disappointing dinner elsewhere, and a good place to warm up after being frozen by the unexpected return of winter in June (well done UK)...We didn't have to wait long as we nabbed two high seats at the bar and started enjoying the completely overdone diner theme and jukebox tunes. My guy has a weird knack for choosing drinks for people so I trusted his choice of a 'Choconaut' hard shake for me. He wasn't wrong. Rum, dark choc liqueur and choc ice cream, that altogether tasted like a boozy version of Belgian Chocolate flavoured Haagen-Dazs (obv the best HD flavour) with yummy little bits of chocolate in it too. His bourbon and peanut butter choice was a little too peanutty for me but he was happy with it.The staff were ridiculously difficult to get the attention of, but redeemed by the cheeky guy behind the bar who err may or may not have obeyed a throwaway comment to go heavy on the bourbon in my guy's drink! I can't comment on the food, but the hard shakes might just bring me back to order the exact same thing again...",

    "text": "My kids begged to come here tonight because they missed the food from home, \u00a0mainly burgers, fries and a good milkshake. We saw the so-so reviews but decided to give them a chance, mainly because my kids wanted it so bad. The kids ordered blueberry pancakes, burger and hot dog and milk shakes. .. all quintessential American food. I ordered a hamburger and hubby ordered catfish poboy. I also ordered a root beer float, \u00a0well, \u00a0because I missed home too. When the drinks came out, the kids' milk shakes were soupy and warm, not frosty, thick and malty like a milk shake should be. My root beer was warm too, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that quickly melted to cool off the drink. My kids hated their shake and refused to drink it, and that's saying a lot since \u00a0that's one of the reason they came here for. When I mentioned the problem with the drinks to the waitress she seemed put off and said she needed \u00a0to call the manager in order to fix it. The manager came and quickly gave me another float, this time with chilled root beer. The waitress took my daughter's milk \u00a0shake to replace but never came back with another drink. \u00a0She finally did after I remind her that she had taken away the milk shake to replace and had not done so. \u00a0I had a feeling she was avoiding our table altogether. About the food: \u00a0burgers were very dry, the blueberry pancakes were actually plain pancakes with blueberry jam on top, and the other foods lackluster in taste and quality. \u00a0The bill came out to almost 70 pounds, quite a lot considering we were eating pretty basic foods and had 2 kids meal. \u00a0They charged my daughter the replacement drink, and I had to ask them to remove it, and added a 12% service charge to the bill, which I didn't appreciate at all....Overall, bad food, bad service, the WORST meal \u00a0we've had in London, to be sure. This place \u00a0does INJUSTICE to the American Diner experience .",

My friend got a more bog standard eggy breakfast which she enjoyed as well. It is a great location and we sat outside in the sun! Not a bad price including a cocktail. Next time a group came for dinner and we sat inside. It's quite dark and loud but the waiters were nice. I got a burger (we all did) and I really thought it was average as a bit dry. Everyone else seemed to enjoy but it wasn't amazing. With a few beers and sides it became quite pricey and not good value at all. Won't be coming back for dinner although their hard shakes (alcoholic milkshakes) look good and food wasn't bad just better value for nicer burgers else where.Will be coming back to sample the rest of their breakfast menu tho!",

This does give you the options on the choice of sides you want or none at all.I went for the most healthy option that I could find on the menu, a Cheeseburger salad (\u00a310). This was a bunless beef patty where the bun is replaced by salad. The salad consisted of lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, croutons, shredded cheese with Diner burger sauce and mustard.As well as the original fries, The Diner also has other fries to choose. I found the Wet Fries (\u00a33.40) disappointing as for me the gravy was too water down and did not have much flavour. The Chilli cheese fries (\u00a35) was better than the wet fries but it was not the best version I have had in London.Overall, the food was okay but nothing special. It would not been a place I would choose to dine but considered this dining evening as an opportunity to add on to the places visited in London. \u00a0When I looked around that evening, I felt like I had a mirror of seeing myself dining here in my younger days. For me this would had been a restaurant that I would had gone in those days.",

The atmosphere is akin to a backstage lounge yet the staff are friendly and approachable even as they are spinning cocktail mixers. My brother ordered pancakes as it was around 11, but as a Leeds-trained Yelper I went for the burger to join the burger quest.After witnessing the couple beside us who sat down 10 minutes after we did receive and finish their meal I asked our waitress how our meals were doing (accepting that burgers sometimes take longer than the apparently vegan meal out neighbours were eating) and it turned out their had been a printing error in the kitchen. The meals were out within 5 minutes of this and as an apology and goodwill gesture we got the whole experience for free!To summarise - lovely food, lovely staff, lovely place! Would definitely recommend!",

    "text": "Yet another mediocre attempt to recreate an American diner by restaurateurs who apparently haven't been in many. The main issue here was the inconsistency: some things were great, some were terrible. The staff were absolutely bored and disinterested, and bordering on rude. The food breakdown: Creamy Nut hard shake was fantastic, boozy enough without being too boozy; the side of French toast was fine and used actual maple syrup, though the toast was a bit thin; sweet potato fries were of the pre-frozen unsalted variety, as expected, but no complaints. The so-called Reuben was totally inedible, served on cold white toast (seriously?), sauerkraut right out of the fridge, cold meat, cheese not only didn't melt but was stiff, horrible salt beef, and of course the whole thing was stone cold. It wasn't one of those cases of \"this isn't [insert the food it claims it is] but it's still ok on its own merit\", it was the sort of thing you'd expect to eat at a Soviet canteen during particularly lean times.On the other hand, the Cali burger was perfectly cooked to medium as requested, though it lacked house made guacamole, and came on a decent roll, with the toppings an afterthought. Diner wings were mushy with no hot sauce, but hot sauce was made available at the table. The blue cheese dip they came with was weird, with a foamy texture, and blatantly pre-packaged; it certainly didn't taste anything like blue cheese dressing. Freakshow wings have an offensive name but were nicely crisp and served with a good dip. The whole place was understaffed, and from start to finish the food took over an hour to come, which is sort of ridiculous.The take-away message: you'll find things here that you really like, other things that are really just inedible, and you have to be prepared for poor service and a very long wait. On the other hand, you're likely to get in without a huge wait for a table on a weekend brunch, so there's that.",

    "text": "Sometimes when you're traveling you need a little taste of home, something to keep you grounded while traveling, a comfort in the memory of good food. That is where I found myself during my second day in London, and the reason why I chose to go to The Diner.I checked out the menu online, and it looked authentic, you know truly American. There were numerous versions of hamburgers and hot dogs, basket combo's of fried proteins with French fries and coleslaw. They even had blue-plate specials. Now come on who doesn't remember those from their childhood. Plus, they had a decent selection of vegetarian dishes. I was sold.Oh, how foolish I was to think I could get real American diner food here in London. The menu may have been authentic, but the food was in the words of many Londoners, rubbish. It was as if they photocopied an American diner menu, but hadn't a clue as to how to prepare any of the food.The tomato soup (usually one of my favorites) was loaded with garlic and onions. Blindfolded I would not have known there were tomatoes in the soup. It was watered down, thin, and other than the onion and garlic flavorless.The grilled cheese sandwich was far worse. It was wrapped in paper (as is usually served here in London with fish and chips), it only helped in holding in the grease of the cheese. The sandwich was thick, heavy, and literally falling apart from the grease. I have no idea what sort of cheese they used, as there wasn't any cheese flavor, just bread and grease.I suppose here in London, no one is going to know what true American diner food is like, but let me tell you something, nothing about the place remotely resembles it, except for the menu.Love from my dog bowl to yours...happy eating.Shatasdogbowl",

    "text": "This place is so barf, I can't even. Im a kind Yelper, you know me, but barf barf barfathon. The drinks were borderline terrible. They were literally NOT meant for human consumption, and the wine was used car fuel with a sprinkle of deception and unemployment blues. Just absolutely preposterous. We didnt try the food, but good on us for not - I dont usually fancy the actual physical action of throwing up, unless Im in a really classy toilet in Mayfair.",

One good thing was the milkshake that was quite good probably one of the best things on the menu",
