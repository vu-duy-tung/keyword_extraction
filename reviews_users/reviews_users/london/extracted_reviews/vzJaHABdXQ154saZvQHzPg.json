Sauces - very good to excellent. \u00a0I had bernaise and peppercorn sauces and loved them both. \u00a0If you are a sauce aficionado, order more than one of each.Burger - usually a daily special. \u00a0Very beefy and flavorful. \u00a0They cook it either med rare or well done (nothing in between). \u00a0Order it med rare or it is too dry.Side salads - comes with the flat iron steak. \u00a0They use coarsely ground dijon mustard vinaigrette and it tastes great.Eggplant with parmigiano - another great side dish. \u00a0Properly seasoned and tasty.Fries - go great with bernaise sauce, that's why you need more than one side of sauce.Great service too!",

    "text": "Flat Iron in Covent Garden is a prime destination for a decent steak. And if you go with the flat iron cut, this place - one of the three branches anyway - must be the unbeatable favourite in London for any budget-conscious steak enthusiast.Flat Iron opened its third branch in London. The restaurant is located seconds from Covent Garden and houses a little butchery showroom at the front. If you have been to Flat Iron before, you know what to expect: exposed brick walls, wooden tables and stools, and most importantly of course the signature mini meat cleavers. All presented in a friendly, muted, light with various kinds of mostly rock music in the background that seemed timeless, if I remember correctly - I was there for the food after all, not for the music.I immediately got a table - however, if you are a group of more than four, I guess you will most likely have to wait. Just like the other two Flat Iron branches, I predict that this one will also be notoriously busy. My dinner started with a slight disappointment. The lovely waitress explained entertainingly which meats they have as specials today by showing where the cuts are from on herself. Definitely more captivating than simply pointing to the cut on the back of the menu. Unfortunately, by the time I placed my order, they had run out of the cut I wanted to try. One other option sounded a bit rustic, and the third was too large for me. So I setteld with the signature flat iron steak. Not a bad choice by any means, but I would have liked to try something different this time.I spontaneously decided to go for a red wine and after I asked for a non-oaky recommendation, I ended up ordering the Brambley French Malbec. The wine had a deep, red colour, strong and heavy, with a bit of fruit. Usually, this is exactly not the kind of wine I order, but for a medium-rare steak, this sounded like a good match. Overall, I did enjoy the wine, but next time I might go for one of the lighter white options instead. The second set back followed when I noticed that they did not provide popcorn at this branch. Well, maybe they do, and I was just unlucky, but after I got used to the tasty popcorn at the other branches, I had the feeling that I was missing out on something.All the hiccups were quickly forgotten when the beautiful plate of slate and wood arrived with the elegantly presented, sliced steak. It looked bigger than I remembered, but it could well be exactly the same size as at the other two restaurants.They have definitely perfected the flat iron steak over the years and without a question, you will struggle to match this quality and taste for a similar price in London. The steak is perfectly cooked, medium-rare, with a pleasant beef flavour and a tender, buttery texture that melts in the mouth. This steak is as good as a flat iron steak can get.The side salad that comes with the steak is okay, which is perhaps the highest praise I will ever give to any salad. I had chosen to get some fries together with my steak. Fries are supposed to be salty, so I cannot fault them on that. The little fried potato strips are as accomplished as the steak. They are a golden, crunchy delight. I would almost go as far as to advise you to go there only for the fries, really.The charmingly quirky pepper mill on the table made my dinner just a little bit more fun. And for me, steak and fries can always benefit from a dose of freshly ground black pepper corns.Motivated by a little history about one of the first ice cream makers in London with a shop in Covent Garden, Carlo Gatti, Flat Iron offers a complementary salted caramel ice cream with Dominican chocolate shavings. Salted-caramel-everything slowly becomes boring at a time when it seems more difficult to find a dessert without salted caramel, than with it. Accordingly, the highlight of the small ice cream dessert were clearly the strongly flavoured, delicate chocolate shavings.All in all, Flat Iron in Covent Garden is an outstanding steak restaurant with friendly service, where you will most likely get the best value for your money anywhere in London - if not the world - when it comes to their signature flat iron steak. A \u00a0full dinner with a glass of wine, a salad, a steak, chips and a dessert comes in for as much as you usually pay just for a high-quality steak. That alone is an achievement.",

They expect people to do this, so they will 'rush' an order when you're half way done if you want; it will be to your table as you're finishing the last bite of the first one. They have various cuts available, but I'd stick with the flat iron steak. I had two and was stuffed. Their salad dressing is pretty good, too -- Italian with a touch of mustard flavor. My girlfriend got the the hamburger with bernaise sauce.... Mmmm tasty. The fries were about the best I've ever had and I heard they drip steak juice all over them, which would explain their mouth watering flavor.The service was good and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The ambience is like a cross between a local pub and a steakhouse, and they serve you a complimentary ice cream cone when you're done. They had salted caramel ice cream topped with bitter sweet chocolate shavings for a nice sweet treat to top off the scrumptious dinner. I'm visiting from the US and we have nothing like this place there. I'd recommend this for anyone that wants a juicy, flavorful steak that happens to be derived from their very own farm ( which apparently is where their meat is from, which explains why it is so affordable). 5 stars all around... Better that Ruth's Chris for a quarter the price and twice the portion.",

This steak comes with some mixed greens and you can order from a list of sides. We went with the fries and the eggplant. They also have changing specials, there was a burger and another type of steak, I believe, the day we went, but we came for their speciality and we were not disappointed. After waiting for over an hour for a seat at this very popular restaurant, which doesn't take reservations by the way, we were finally seated and got water and complimentary popcorn while we looked over the menu. The steak itself is tender, was cooked a perfect medium rare and was seasoned beautifully. There are a number of sauces to choose for your steak, we opted for Fred's special sauce and the b\u00e9arnaise. Both were delicious and paired well with the steaks. The fries were crisp and seasoned, the eggplant was a huge winner. The layers of eggplant, cheese and a beautiful tomato sauce were heavenly and had the steak not been as good, I would have eaten this as a main dish. The steak with the greens was a measly \u00a310 which is awesome considering the expensive downtown location. The sauces were \u00a31 each and the sides were \u00a33.50 I believe. At about \u00a315 each we were quite happy with our meal and would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes a good steak. Another highlight of this meal was the free ice cream you get at the end. With your receipt comes a token which you bring to the front and exchange for a caramel ice cream, dipped in dark chocolate shavings in a fresh waffle cone. It was a fantastic way to finish our meal.The ambiance is really cool and cozy and the service was great. The restaurant is beautiful, albeit small but it adds to the intimate environment. At about \u00a315 each we were quite happy with our meal and would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes a good steak in a cool environment.",

Well, this is one of those places where the chef got something right and didn't fuss with it!A quality steak at 10\u00a3 with things like chips etc on the side. That's it. There were specials like a larger steak and one really large steak to share on the chalk board. We stuck with what they obviously know.Steak was very tender. Broccoli and asparagus cooked perfectly and the chips (fries in our country) were good enough to order seconds. As if that wasn't enough, we were given a free token for a ice cream at check out. We got the Carmel dark chocolate cone they offered because it would be rude to say no. The chocolate was a bit dark for me but if you like 72% cacao, you're going to love it!The servers were also cheerful and knowledgeable! Our was was 45 minutes, as advertised when we walked in. No worries, just enough time for a drink with the young crowd and a preview of the menu.Lovely evening! Thanks Flat Iron!",

Enjoyed the twist on a classic cocktail. On to the important part:- Food: flat iron steak - 10\u00a3 was a steal. It came out a perfect medium-rare. Sides - creamed spinach and chips. Everything was fantastic, perhaps a little heavy though. - Service: Really friendly server Ollie who had some great recs! Try the peppercorn sauce. - Decor: Big fan of the atmosphere that wasn't too loud and enjoyed reading the signs about the beef we were eating. Maybe too much info though haha. Overall would definitely recommend going to! Try to hit it at an off-time although you'll likely still have a wait. Budget a couple hours and enjoy! P.S. Don't forget to snag the complimentary ice cream on the way out",

    "text": "We got there on a saturday just past lunchtime with a party of four and expected a queue. Incredibly we were immediately allocated a nice table and given enamel mugs filled with pop corn to munch on while we perused the (very short) menu. Basically it's steak, a couple of specials (also beef related) on the board + a few sauces and sides. That's it. Find whatever it is that you do well and stick to it. :)We skipped cocktails and started with beers; my Beaverton IPA was ridiculously good: fruity and smooth. The wine we ordered afterwards was so good the table went through three bottles - sadly the name was forgotten, though it is hardly surprising after all that booze.For a tenner you get a reasonably sized piece of beautifully cooked cow. They do recommend it medium rare and it's your best bet as long as you don't mind a bit of blood. Amazing quality meat is often destroyed by overcooking; \u00a0not here. The side salad is just a bunch of somewhat limp leaves and doesn't do it for me, so I barely touched it. If you need greens with your meat + carbs I'd suggest ordering another salad from the sides menu. For our sides we ordered the chips because: beef dripping! Best fries, done the best way: crunchy outside, fluffy inside. Yes. :) My choice of sauce was bearnaise and it was on point, matching the buttery texture of \u00a0the beef so well. One order of creamed spinach never materialized, though, but later showed up on the bill - it was promptly removed after we mentioned.Service is friendly and attentive; they do hover a bit, but maybe it was because of where we were seated. As a final treat, since they don't mooch about with dessert menus, after you settle the bill you are given a token for a free ice cream on your way out. That ensures people will not sit there idly when there's salted caramel ice cream (with chocolate shavings + a good quality cone, it needs to be mentioned) to be had. Customer leaves happy = tables quickly vacated = next customers also happy. ;)",

    "text": "Last May, I visited Flat Iron's second restaurant on Denmark street just outside Soho. \u00a0I've just tried out their third, and largest yet restaurant in the heart of Covent Garden - proving once again that London's desire for beef has not waned.The Covent Garden restaurant features a glass-fronted butchery room that shows off the beef as you enter. \u00a0Downstairs there is a working on-site microbrewery and just inside the front door you'll find and old-time ice cream counter. \u00a0And it's worth noting: they give you an salted-caramel ice cream for free when you're on your way out!The menu is still anchored by the \u00a310 flat iron steak - it's juicy, rich, flavorful and tender if you don't ruin it by ordering anything above medium-rare. \u00a0But, what I saw on my last visit is that Flat Iron is getting into daily specials that go up on the blackboard as the evening wears on. \u00a0We enjoyed a \u00a312 flank steak, shown here, in addition to a flat iron. \u00a0They also were rotating through some other cuts on the chalkboard as we ate. \u00a0I saw a little sirloin cut and chateaubriand being written up there after all the flank steaks were polished off by the hungry horde.As ever, the resident special is the b\u00e9arnaise-smothered burger, but you'll only hear this from the wait-staff - it won't appear on that new specials board. The burger is served on a toasted sesame seed bun with some diced onions. \u00a0That's it - direct and to the point. \u00a0You can get a variety of hipster-sounding dips to spice it up a bit, but I like it as it is. \u00a0The ground beef is up to the standard of Flat Iron's steaks - a bit lean for a burger - but delicious nonetheless.Next up, I'll have to try out their newest location in Shoreditch! But for now, you can check out my full review: beeffanatic.com/2016/06/\u2026",

The restaurant is a lot bigger than it looks from the outside!We both ordered the 'Flat Iron Steak', it was beautifully cooked and definitely lives up to the hype. We shared sides - chips, aubergine and creamed spinach. The bearnaise sauce was a little tangy and not to my liking so I'd probably get peppercorn next time, although the creamed spinach acted as a nice sauce! \u00a0I was recommended the Plum & Apreol Spritz by the barman, it was very moreish and I'll definitely be getting it again next time.The free salted caramel ice cream at the end of the meal is a very nice touch. Although it was busy I didn't feel rushed or pressured to pay immediately after finishing our food, which can often be the case in places like this. We were able to eat our ice cream at the table and had a bit of time for our food to go down before leaving, which was nice.All in all a great place to come for a quick, cheap dinner.",

Wait, you're saying that just because I'm a meatlover makes me unable to judge objectively ? Yes, there's the meat, but there's also the idea & the attention to details, and that's where Flat Iron seduces.The idea - as simple as offering a great flat-iron style steak for a tenner. For this price, you'd expect the meat to be OK, but trust me, this was much more than just a standard OK.The details - first, this branch (their third in total) looks amazing from the outside as well as the inside. We've landed here by chance, looking for a cheap restaurant in the area (good luck) and well, we found this fancy-looking steakhouse.Thumbs up for : - the butcher room, where a cool dude cuts fresh meat on the spot.- the huge block of ice on the bar : it's pure compressed water, with no single bubble, which makes it last 48 hours !- the token, given to you at the end of the meal, to enjoy a great free ice-cream. Boom.- the team, very pro and enthusiastic ! Heads up to Paolo, one of the cool italian dudes, and Lucky, the ice-cream lady.The place is full every single day, but it's clearly worth the wait. A lovely dinner and global experience for 30 pounds, that's decent right ?",

    "text": "The Soho Flat Iron was recommended to me by a fellow Yelper, but when I heard that there was normally a two hour wait for a table I was ready to delete it from my bookmarksWe were immediately seated. A server explained the menu and the specials and we ordered. The food and drinks came out quickly. Everything was well prepared and fresh. I ordered the flat iron for 10 \u00a3, and the dripping cooked chips. The dripping chips were amazing. They're french fries with steak drippings (i.e. the delicious fatty part) drizzled on. Like everyone else said, the steak was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and a decent cut. The only issue I had was with the \"salad\" that came with the steak, which was mixed greens in a cup with dressing. I ate all of it though, because I can't just be eating beef and potatoes can I? I also had the lime/mint house fizzy, which was basically a non-alcoholic mojito and delicious. I can only imagine how good the other options were. After eating, we were given after dinner ice cream. It was pretty good, and a nice touch on a relatively cheap meal.",

The salad is so fresh and the fries were delicious. On our way out, we had the free ice cream . The flavor was bizarre couldn't tell if salty or sugary but it was yummiiii first time i finish an ice cream . I am not an ice cream fan. I wish I can give 6 stars to flat iron .

There can be a little bit of a wait as it's so popular and they don't have many tables for groups but it's always well worth it and the great barman making fantastic Old Fashions means that the time flies by. The waiter was great fun, manager friendly, food amazing, perfect minimal menu with just one type of excellent steak so no long debates about over-priced Chateaubriand. I've been to a lot of steak restaurants in London and this is by far my favourite. Even the creamed spinach is amazing and the free ice cream, served with a smile, rounds the meal off perfectly.I'd wanted to go to Flat Iron for ages but was a bit put off by the queues at their smaller branches so was so happy when the big Covent Garden one opened. I've been here both with groups and as a couple and both experiences are excellent. I can't recommend it highly enough.",

    "text": "Flat Iron still knows the way to my heart! This latest outpost in Covent Garden is brighter and more spacious than their others, but the menu is the same - flat iron steak cooked to your liking with a choice of sides. And of course, a mini meat cleaver utensil to get stuck in properly.There's still the no reservations policy and ensuing queues, so we got there early - about 6.15ish - and were seated immediately. Perhaps a liiiittle too close to our neighbours at the communal table to enjoy date night to its fullest but cosy, and coathooks were appreciated.There was a burger special available on the night but we both went for the steak, medium-rare. It was as tasty as I remembered from the other branch, beautifully pink inside and actually chopped small enough that I didn't strictly need to use my cleaver (but obvs I made some token use anyway!). The sides were much more buttery than I remembered though - it oozed from the creamed spinach, and was a strong taste in both the chips and the initial popcorn they brought out to munch. Maybe it's a tactic to make you thirstier?! If so it worked with us and our merlot, which they serve in very hipster jars poured into tumblers rather than proper wine glasses.The highlight for me was the amazingly friendly service - from the smiley front of house who enjoyed my relief that there wasn't an hour's wait, to our lovely waiter with perfect manners. I felt really well looked after. The only service tweak I'd suggest is to make sure the bar keeps up with the kitchen - both ourselves and the couple next to us got their drinks after the steaks had arrived, which wasn't the most relaxing way round.A tasty and budget-conscious choice at \u00a322 a head which included a good amount of wine, service, extra sauce and even a dessert on the way out - yep, as you pay the bill they give you a token to redeem by the door for a salted caramel ice cream cone. Definitely ensures you'll leave with a big smile on your face :)",

By the time we were served our lunch they already had a line waiting to be seated. Sadly they don't take reservations. But turnover is fast. They start out with a bowl of popcorn. Then the steaks and sides (fries and vegetables) cooked to perfection. \u00a0 Upon leaving they provide you with a homemade caramel and toffee ice cream in a cone to go. A great lunch experience at a very reasonable price. Food quality, service and value 4 stars. Check them out if you are in London.",

    "text": "Rating this establishment has been a bit of a roller coaster. I walked into the restaurant thinking, \"easy 5, I love the vibe this place gives.\"We(a group of 3) waited half an hour for seats and got put at a table made for four. The waitress brought us a small bucket of popcorn and I was shocked at how satisfying popcorn can be when eaten out of a bucket.The thing that made me question my judgment about the place was when the waitress sat down in the fourth empty seat at our table when taking our orders. That's not necessarily bad, just a little surprising. It caught me off guard. Anyways, they only have one entree available: their flat iron steak. For sides, we got the roasted aubergine(or eggplant for you uncultured folks). The eggplant was just ok. So at this point I'm doubting my Initial hopes of this restaurant. But then the rest of our food came.The salad was pretty nice, but the steak WAS SO GOOD. It was juicy, tender, and beefy. Everything you can hope for from a steak. The sauces we got were the peppercorn, horseradish, and the Freddy's one. The peppercorn sauce was pretty good. The horseradish was ok. The Freddy's was somewhere i between those two. I wish I could've tried the Bernaise though. And here I am wanting to give this place a 5 again.We finished our meal and it took way too long for our server to get our check. So now I'm swinging back and forth unable to decide if the food was worth the service. But then something magical happened.WE GOT FREE ICE CREAM!!! Ok ok, I know what you're thinking. \"It's probably just some average vanilla ice cream.\" I'm here to tell you no. Guys, this ice cream is a total game changer. It was buttery and a little salty, perfectly sweet. Honestly it might've been some of the best I've ever had. Like I might come here again just for more of that.Overall: service is meh, food is yum, ICE CREAM IS FREE AND DELICIOUS.",

The flat iron steak they serve comes with a side salad. They don't take reservations but we were a party of 7. They took my name and number down and told me that it will be about an hour wait. 20 minutes later, I received a call and they said a party had cancel and to head back to the restaurant; which was 5 minutes walking distance from our hotel. \u00a0They had a ribeye special that feeds up to 3 people that was 35\u00a3. We ordered that and 3 flat irons but our server told us that they sold he last ribeye so we all ordered 6 flat irons. Two orders of chips, a few drinks for only 30\u00a3 per person. Highly highly recommend if you're ever in London! I wish they had one here in the US!",

I found this restaurant on Yelp, and there were good reviews, so I decided to come here for dinner.When I arrived here around 5:30pm, there was about a 20 minutes wait. I had two options to chose while waiting: wait inside or give them my phone number, so they could text me when a table is ready. My phone didn't work in London, so I waited inside. After 20 minutes, I was called to be seated. They gave me complimentary popcorn. There were one long table, and people would sit next to each other. A person next you is very close that you can clearly hear their conversation. The server came, explained the special menu, and the popular dish which was flat steak medium rare. I ordered the steak as recommended. There were some sauces and sides but I didn't get any.The food came in 15 minutes, and it looked good. It came with a small salad. My steak was perfectly cooked and very tender. It seasoned well and flavorful. It was well worth the price. The portion was generous. If you're starving, I recommend to order sides. Otherwise, you'll be satisfied.The service was good, and the staff was friendly.You'll get complimentary ice cream after the meal which was good! The wait can be long if you come during the busy time, but it's worth the wait. I will come back here whenever I'm in town.",

Walking around London around the Piccadilly Circus you'll find 100's of varying restaurants and after a couple nights in London we got the layout down and there were some good and bad places we found. This was one of the GREAT places we found. My wife was craving some steak and greens so we searched high and low for a steak place to satisfy our cravings.We stumble on this place with great lighting and and very hip modern design. We checked the prices and for \u00a310 you get an 8oz steak and salad which really tickled my pickle, a bang for your buck ? I'll take it any day. So the waitlist was about \u00a01 hour and 40 minutes.. I was going to walk away, but the wifey wanted to stay saying that most places over estimate that wait time(which they did we only waited about 40 minutes) boy was I glad we stayed.So we went in and waited with some popcorn and soda while we waited they do have a bar at the front to get you a little frisky while you wait to be blessed with the best steak of your life. Then we were sat and greeted by our waiter that was very attentive and informative about the menu. We went with the strip steak sides of cream of spinach and fries, peppercorn sauce and brendise sauce. Let's start with the sides the spinach dip alone was a pinch of salt too much BUT I saved it by dipping the potato fries in them which in turn made them better. The peppercorn sauce was my favorite very light and gave the fries a nice little buddy to mingle together with on my tongue. The salad was prepared In a metal cup o think it consisted of arugula and mixed greens but that salad perfectly harmonized with the main entree.And now the final and most important part. THE STEAK. Wow like I said I took my first bite and I couldn't even speak I took another and I still could not speak. Food usually don't do this to a human being but this must've hit some synapsis in my brain that have never been touched. But this steak was an experience to remember, it melted in my mouth and I know that saying is redundant, but that how you describe this juicy tender meat. I read on the wall about some info they have on the meat you're eating that day such as how long the cow,the cows been alive, what it's been fed, what farm it came from. And I guess everything just ties into each bite I had I really didn't want it to be over I was just so taken back by the excellence that my wife and I was served. Put simply go here if you're in London. Best steak and best meal you will have as well as experience.",

I found Flat Iron by chance by searching for restaurants near my hotel in London that were open Sunday evening. After reading a few of the reviews I decided I would head that way and I was not disappointed. This was easily one of the best steaks I've ever had, even better than the 45GBP steak I had at Jamie Oliver's Barbecoa near St Paul's Cathedral. My only complaint was that I was not able to purchase one of their signature cleavers as a souvenir as they were sold out (must be popular!). The staff was beyond accomodating & and the entire expericne was one for the books.",

This is another one of those gems, that I would have never found without yelp. I love \u00a0covent Garden and this place was right off the square.First I was seated next to some yuppies from America who were trashing my man DJ, but I did not let that get to me. Lord, help the because they know no better.Regardless, I ordered the signature flat iron steak rare, although the burger looked tempting, but the waiter talked me down, and encouraged me to get the steak. I also ordered a side of horseradish sauce and chips (fries), an 8 ball rye Ipa and gamma ray pale ale.The steak was cooked in butter and seasoned in smoked salt, and served on a platter. I used my mini butcher knife to cut this bad boy, and it was the best cut I've had in a long time. The fries were crisp, and the salad was lightly seasoned. So when you come here, get the steak, you will not regret it.",

Upon telling Lucky I was vegan everyone laughed but she informed me that they had sides of steamed broccoli and cabbage that could work for me and of course I ordered 2 of each! Not only were they delicious, but they were cheap and filling as well! I spent \u00a310 on my meal as opposed to the \u00a350 my friends ate, we were all satisfied so thats all that matters! Lucky had good conversation and knew the menu and ingredients very well, also hooked all of us up with an extra ice cream at the end! (Ice cream is Not vegan, i gave my cones to others).Ultimately this was one of the most memorable and best dining experiences I had on my 3 week trip to the UK, and I am surprised that it was at a steakhouse. Thanks for a good time and nice memory!",

This provides a opportunity to visit many of the shoppes and vendors throughout the area whilst waiting. The food was excellent and the service friendly/ efficient. \u00a0The ambiance was chic with upstairs and downstairs bars. \u00a0Lively and interesting. \u00a0Cheers.",

    "text": "If you're craving some steak while in London, Flat Iron is the place to go! We visited the location in the middle of Covent Garden, and as expected, it was very popular! Fortunately, we noticed a queue forming already around 5:30pm and put our name and phone number on the waiting list, since when we came back later around 6:15pm, the queue had jumped to a whopping 1.5-2 hours! Definitely recommend dropping by a bit early to ensure you snag a table before it gets too crowded - you can walk around and browse the rest of Covent Garden while you wait! Flat Iron is known for their signature flat iron steak, which comes with a small house leaf salad on the side. The menu focuses solely on this, so it makes for easy ordering (hopefully)! You can also choose to get their ribeye instead, and/or pair your steak with some of their sauce or sides. Both of us ordered the flat iron steak special and shared sides of market greens (British broccoli for that day), aubergine, and chips. The steak comes pre-sliced and was tender and tasty. I couldn't stop talking about the mini cleaver that you get to cut your meat instead of a regular steak knife - it is so adorable that apparently they had to put a note on their menu to please not steal it and that it was available for purchase for \u00a310 if you liked it that much! The chips were crispy and delicious, and the boyfriend particularly enjoyed the roasted aubergine and the peppercorn sauce as well. The service was the only thing that missed the mark a bit - our waitress took an extremely long time to acknowledge us and take our order, and then it took a while to get her attention to give us our check at the end despite her clearing our table and confirming previously that we didn't want any more drinks. They were unfortunately out of their limited Yorkshire beer too for the day.Otherwise, the trendy ambiance and good food made for a great visit! I think we both wished that we got a bit more steak, but for \u00a311, it wasn't a bad deal at all. There was complimentary popcorn at the beginning of the meal and (my favorite part) salt caramel ice cream with chocolate shavings for dessert! You just take your receipt up to the counter as you're leaving. It was so, so good and a fabulous way to end the meal!",

They were nice enough to let me sit at a table anyway because they said it will get busier and then we'd have to wait longer for a table. Great service.While waiting they give you delicious popcorn. And you can get refills if you want.During our visit they had some specials like a burger and another cut of steak. But we stuck to the flat iron. It tasted like buttered popcorn in the best way possible. I'm sure a sauce would be good too but it's not needed.We also ordered the chips and they were perfectly cooked.To top it all off, the hazelnut ice cream covered in freshly shaved chocolate was probably the best ice cream I ate in Europe and I had a lot!I also ordered a fizzy passion fruit drink which was so good but sadly so much ice for \u00a33. I wish they had this where I live cause I could come here all the time. It may seem basic, but it's a don't miss place for me next trip.",

Cocktails are bottom tier of drinks for me, but i loved these!The bartender was very friendly and nice. They really put care into making their drinks.We were seated less than 10 mins later also downstairs.We ordered our steaks medium rare. One came a little more medium than rare, but both were acceptable. The steaks are seasoned well and very juicy. Use the cute machetes to cut it up.The salad comes in a little pail and was very earthy tasting with a pretty acidic dressing, but it was good.We also got crispy drippings chips batch #128 which were okay, but nothing special.The food came very quickly and our server was extremely friendly and pleasant (but also everyone else we came into contact with in London?!)He was very good about refilling waters and checking up on us.At the end of the meal, they will give you cute baby machetes in which you trade in for ice cream upstairs by the door!Toffee Ice cream was the ice cream of the day and it was served in a crispy wafer-like cone. Toffee isn't my favorite in general but the ice cream was pretty good. I did really like the cone though!So REALLY, it's steak + salad + ice cream for \u00a311.WORTH IT.I'll definitely be returning.",

It is al carte, so be mindful you have to pay extra for sides. Regardless, it was worth it. Everything was delicious and well done. The service was quick and friendly. Our waitress sat next to us as we ordered-- something I have never experienced in the States. They gave us complimentary gelato afterwards, which was a great surprise! Finally, the ambiance is so cool. It is communal style; we were seated at a long table next to others dining--again, something I have never experienced in the states. I would highly suggest this place if you are dining in London. When we come back, we will return to Flat Iron again for dining.",

We also ordered the burger special that came with the same meat, but the sauce it came with was just to die for! We actually used it to dip the flank! After devouring the first flank, we actually ordered a second flank because it was that good! Some cons of this place is that they serve only one meat a day (I don't really think this is a bad thing because they make it really good!), and the sides (fries, sauce, etc) are extra and kind of pricey. They also have a ice cream station in the front, by the bar, that seems to be really popular. Again, only 1 flavor a day. AMBIANCE: This place is big. The tables are arranged pretty close to one another, so be prepared to get cozy! They have a bar upstairs/street level, as well as downstairs (no seating downstairs). Lights are dimmed and gives off a warm homey vibe. SERVICE: Everyone is really friendly and works really quickly here! Upon arrival, without reservations they will ask for you number so they can call you when there is a table ready, but we didn't have a UK number so we got a buzzer instead! Verdict: I highly recommend this place if you are visiting London! It's a cheaper alternative for fancy restaurants that serve similar meat (with casual environment of course) !",

My friend recommended it but said there can sometimes be a waitlist up to 3 hours because it is that good! Luckily for us we came in on a Sunday night so we only waited for about 15 minutes and were able to take a seat at the bar and enjoy a few drinks before transferring to a table. You are seated with complimentary popcorn then i ordered a steak well done with a side salad and green beans. The steak was cooked perfectly and didn't have a single part of fat in it and the green beans had a seasoning on them that made me wish they never ended. At the end of the dinner you receive a complimentary ice cream for free at a little homemade ice cream set up near the front. Icing on the cake!",

    "text": "After traveling all day and flying into London around 9pm, we were famished and looking for places to eat our first solid meal of the day and found Flat Iron to be open late. We were told that it would be a 10-15 minute wait which was fine since that would give us time to situate ourselves with the menu and have a much needed drink at the bar. The place was packed on a late Thurs evening and we were seated at one of their communal tables so there really wasn't much of a personal space. Our server was friendly and explained that for 10 pounds, their one entree consisted of a flat iron steak, and small side salad (you can order other sides like chips or veggies as an add on). She also explained that they also had late night specials for the same price but the cut of the meats were more tender and that basically it's a bang for your buck or in this case pounds. We ordered the L.C. which was part of their specials and added on chips as a side.Both our medium cooked LC steaks were nicely cooked and though the side salad was very small, for 10 pounds, I really can't complain. The meal ends with a token given to you to take to the front of the restaurant where you will receive a chocolate sea salt ice cream cone. YES. The only drawback of the meal was when we were looking at our check, we saw that a donation was already added on to the meal. The last time I checked, a donation is given voluntarily by the person donating it. We weren't even aware the restaurant was participating in any charity so that was a bit of a turn off.",

I figured it would be good when the host told us that it would be a three-hour wait. I was only in London for the night and I wanted good food, so I waited. I put my name on the list and explored Covent Garden - which is now my favorite little section of London. When sat down, I was given popcorn to snack on and water immediately. The menu was super simple to read and and I ordered the recommended flat iron steak with a side of fries. The price was great for what I got. I like how they also presented you with \u00a0a flat iron to chop the steak, too. It just adds to the fun experience. And, the steak was delicious! Afterward you get a token for a free ice cream on your way out. So, essentially dessert is included. I loved that part!",

It was fairly easy to drink and was tasty. We then sat down and ordered, flat iron for me (11pounds), ribeye (16 pounds), for the hubs along with chips and peppercorn sauce. This also came with a nice light greens with some vinaigrette. We also got popcorn to munch on. The steaks came out medium rare which was perfect. Mine was sliced into pieces and the ribeye wasn't. We smothered the peppercorn on it. It was delicious. My flat iron wasn't as good as the ribeye and was a little chewy but that's why the diff in price.

As for drinks, I ordered the spicy red italian wine which I would recommend (it is not actually spicy). We also got the flank steak, special (cut 3 from the hindquarter), chips and spinach. The flank steak also comes with a green salad. It depends on the special, however I would recommend the flank steak. Cut 3 was a bit too beefy and chewy for my taste. We also ordered a the pepper sauce, but it was not needed. The meat is very good by itself! However, if you do order a sauce, you can certainly share it between two people. Also, make sure to take a look at the walls for the specials (I.e. Burgers or different cuts of meat). At the end of our meal, we were also given free tokens for ice cream. The ice cream was very good and the perfect finale to our great meal!",

The steak was cooked to our liking with bernaise sauce which was amazing. The drinks were excellent as well I had a strawberry and basil fizz and my mom had Malbec wine which she raved about as well. One of the best parts is the FREE salted caramel ice cream on a cone dipped in fresh 70% cacao chocolate shavings. It was truly the icing on the cake. The prices were extremely reasonable as well. If you have to wait to be seated it is well worth your while and I would strongly recommend this to whomever is in London! I wish we lived closer so we could come back!",

But is beautifully tender each time. You don't get a ridiculously large portion but that is a good thing in truth. And reasonably cheap for what you get. Plus a freebie ice cream. Only one small criticism - they could be a tad more creative with the sides.",

If you have American Express card, it is not accepted here either. Overall experience C+. True, it is relatively cheap, but quality wise \u00a0- not even a \"budget Gaucho\".",

AFTER we sat down and ordered our meal. The ice cream was the only reason I ventured a far, this is entirely unacceptable as I feel I have been taken advantage of and my trust has counted for nothing. After enquiring if they had any alternative desserts we were ushered to the door and told that we will have to come back tomorrow to pick up the \"free\" ice cream tokens. Unacceptable on all counts, 0/10 would not recommend a restaurant that pries on loyal customers. I hope you're happy I spent all night finishing a box of Kleenex off instead of a bowl of the creamiest most decadent churned to perfection cow produce",

The limited menu admittedly really put meOff before but they are great at what they do and obviously take pride in serving good meals. Helpful staff will explain all the beef cuts available and there is even a cow map on the back of the menu if you want to see the placement. On my last visit (as pictured) I was so desperate for their aubergine side twice over - I got it as a main meal and it really lived ip to expectations alongside a mustardy salad i wasn't keen on but also twice cooked with lots of flavour chips and creamed spinach that is rich Tasting but so moreish.

We went at 6 on a dark January Monday so didn't have any trouble getting a table, although it was still unbelievably busy, considering. We were sat at a central table that was pretty close to our neighbours, but no more so than your usual London restaurant. The strangest part of the experience was that our incredibly chatty waitress kept walking past us pretending we were invisible, and so took ages to take our order and even longer to clear our plates, despite being very 'on it' with the surrounding diners. That said, the rest of the staff were excellent, and none of this detracted from the food.Which, as always, was absolutely excellent. The steak was perfectly cooked, the chips were (and always are) some of the best I've ever tasted, and although I nearly always forget about it until I've devoured the meat, the salad was delicious. If it's your kind of thing, go for the bearnaise sauce - so, so good. The free salted caramel ice cream on the way out was creamy and wonderful, and much to my delight caused some raised eyebrows in the pub we went to afterwards, considering it was about 2 degrees outside.The cocktails are also wonderful in every Flat Iron, so even if it's a Monday in January (or rather, because it is), you should definitely have one!",

It was too a painful wait as they have a waiting system where you leave your number with them and they will text you when a table ia available. Being in Covent Garden theres many choices to do within the waiting time - pubs, bars, coffee shop, shopping. Just make sure it is somewhere with phone reception.This branch is pretty cool because they have little den tables which are great for large group. But shame its no booking. The food is standard across all their branches. So their signature \u00a310 flat iron steak which is served with a pop of green salad. You have the option to order sides and sauce. I usually skip the sauce as the steak are pretty well season and juicy. The side can be share and I do like their creamy spinach which is like a sauce of it own and the cheesy aubergine. The flat iron steak is usually tender. But the one I had at this branch was not as tender. But then may be it was just that day.They have other cuts that are special of the day. These will be slightly more expensive. I tend to skip them because the flat iron is a good piece of steak and for the price. I suppose if I want a steak and not bother about the price then I probably consider other places. However it gives a variety to customers.What good about this branch is they give you a free ice cream cone on your way out as they dont have a dessert menu like they do at their other branch.",

It's worth it!My friend and I got their signature flat iron cut as well as the knuckle cut and the burger of the day (I'm sorry I can't remember which cut of meat they used.)We also ordered a side of fries and two drinks.The Flat Iron was so tender and the flavor was on point! They sprinkled it with a bit of sea salt and it just tasted like the perfect balance of beefiness and saltiness. I enjoyed the side salad they gave as well. It came with a light tart dressing which helped ease down all of the meat we were eating. I REALLY enjoyed the burger. When it came out it looked like they had burnt it but it really wasn't. There was slight char on the outside of the burger but it was juicy on the inside and packed with flavor. The creamy sauce that they top it off with rounded out the whole burger!The Knuckle was a lot chewier than the Flat Iron. I felt that it wasn't as flavorful either. Next time I would just order two of the Flat Iron. \u00a0The waitress was attentive and patient enough to explain to us what each cut would be like and what she would recommend. Bless her for serving us at such a late hour and still being so patient and friendly!The kicker is that they give us a free ice cream cone at the end of everything. It's topped with shaved chocolate which is great!If I get to visit London again I would definitely come back to this place with the quickness!",

    "text": "We went to Flat Iron at Covent Garden location tonight as two couples and waited about 45 minutes (90 minutes was the original wait time) before seated at our table.Our table ordered 2 steak specials, 2 sides (fries and aubergine) and all the sauces on the menu. The steak was really delicious, one of the better ones we had in London.This is a great place to meet with friends for dinner after work as they have a casual atmosphere and great drink options.",

    "text": "Straight forward menu, excellent steak for the price. Had a lovely waiter and the restaurant itself had a relaxed feel with it's minimalist vintage decor. Would have taken off half a star for the unimpressive parmesan and aubergine side dish, but the complementary chocolate ice-cream made up for it.",
