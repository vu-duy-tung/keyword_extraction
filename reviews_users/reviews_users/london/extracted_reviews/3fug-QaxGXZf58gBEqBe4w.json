    "text": "Bistrotheque is quite unexpected tucked away just off mare street, and is a strange mix of three separate rooms offering very different \u00a0experiences. There is a small bustling bar where everyone is tightly packed in sipping cocktails, another bar with weird and interesting cabaret shows, and a spacious restaurant upstairs serving really good food - I strongly recommend the steak, but maybe not the gnocchi. It's not exactly intimate though and does maybe retain a bit too much of the warehouse feel, but the service is good and overall the quality of food makes it well worth visiting - even if it's probably a bit pricey.",

It's very posh inside, but not in an uncomfortable, pretentious way at all. There is quite a large choice of foods, all vary in price, not cheap, but you certainly get what you pay for. I had the mussels in a cream sauce, and these were exquizite. It's very atmospheric, dimly lit, and light banter on each table. It's a great place to go for a special occasion, and it feel exciting going there, special to know that it exists. Celebrites have been known to go here too such as Scarlett Johansson, even Madonna. Its very jazzy. The Desserts are to die for, I highly recommend the white chocolate cheesecake, it makes your mouth water with overwhelming pleasure! When finished, you can then go downstairs into the small club and bar, where a cabarat act, and other drag acts are held! Loud music, cocktails, and entertainment. What a great night.",

Bistrotheque is certainly worth trying once as it is different and quite cool with its brasserie menu and white decor in the middle of the East End. But the place is probably trying to be too cool and the restaurant experience tends to disappoint. What will NOT disappoint is the amazing cabaret under the restaurant, we attended the Christmas Carol sung by 3 drag queens and it was really hilarious in this small theatre with a bar at the back and a great vibe and crowd really.",

The first time I went, the food was good (though not as great as the prices might lead one to expect); the second time, my lobster was so overcooked that I couldn't get it out of its shell, and my companion's stake was tough and flavourless. The one thing that doesn't disappoint is the cabaret. Well worth a look and a reservation, the entertainment includes a drag duo and a young female singer doing covers of rock tunes through the ages, accompanied by a sole piano. Particularly brilliant is her Queen medley. Not to be missed. Shame about the food. I really wanted to love this place.",

I mean, I totally understand being charged for service if I have dinner, but for 3 drinks???

Pre-dinner drinks at the light and airy bar on the ground floor were great. There are also a few tables outside, if you're so inclined. The food at the restaurant (open plan, you walk through the kitchen, impossibly hip wait staff and clientele, but all in a very friendly and welcoming environment) is very good and not overly priced. I had oysters and steak tartare and they were delish. My companions tried the razor clams, which they said were a bit too salty, the steak and the pan fried gnocchi, which they loved. The post-dinner cabaret was spectacular. Johnny Woo and Gateau Chocolat were fantastic, mixing old school cabaret with stand up comedy, razor sharp, slam-worthy poetry, opera and even mime!

It makes for an entertaining start to a fantastic experience. To get to the dining area, one has to pass through the kitchen which is always interesting to observe.

If you get some added entertainment for another 5 pounds \u00a0that's even better! This is the package you get at Bistroteque in Bethnal Green, located in a little side street just off Cambridge Heath Road. You have to pay some attention not to walk past the inconspicuous entryway, but when you have finally found your destination you are rewarded with a modern, bright and spacious dining room with high ceilings. Since I have moved to London I am a sucker for big open spaces. Compared to Vienna where I used to live before everything in London is so crammed together and I really miss the feeling of vastness and space. Certainly no reason for claustrophobia at Bistroteque. There were a range of really attractive sounding dishes on the Prix Fix Menu, so no reason to order from the a la carte. The Stichelton, Pear, Pine Nut, Chicory, Spinach starter turned out to be delicious. The combination of bitterness from the chicory, sweet pears and pungent cheese worked so well together and even though it was a simple dish I enjoyed it very much. Also successful, fresh and summary was the second starter of Grilled Spring Onions, Romesco, Parmesan, Herbs. I have to say that the spring onions was the most forgettable part of the dish. The romesco however, which is a Catalan sauce containing red peppers, garlic, nuts and olive oil, was beautiful. I would have happily eaten the herbs, the generous parmesan shavings and the romesco without the onions. Stichelton, Pear, Pine Nut, Chicory, SpinachGrilled Spring Onions, Romesco, Parmesan, Herbs The grilled chicken with garlic was again a very uncomplicated dish. The chicken was very nicely cooked, tender and juicy and didn't overpoweringly taste of garlic. They could have put some more effort though into the condiments. There was just a heap of rocket without any dressing. I loved the beef tartare which was just right. Right coarse consistency of high quality beef, right degree of spiciness and right amount of capers and gherkins. The chips it came with were to die for!grilled chicken with garlicbeef tartare We only had space for one dessert and went for the Chocolate and Rasberry Cake. The rich and moist dark chocolate with a hint or raspberry and some creme fraiche to counterbalance the sweetness was a perfect end to a very nice mealChocolate and Rasberry Cake Bistroteque doesn't do sophisticated cooking. If you want this there are other places to go to. If you want to enjoy simple, well prepared, classic dishes with a strong French influence in contemporary atmosphere, you might be very happy at Bistroteque. I haven't told you about the entertainment yet. Downstairs from the restaurant is a small theatre with bar where you can enjoy cabaret at its best. Well, let's say the Lip Sinkers that play there one a regular basis are truly excellent. This time we went to see 'Under Construction' which is performance platform for new and established performers to show their new work. It probably depends on the evening and who is performing, on the evening we went we decided the 5 pounds we paid in entry were about appropriate for the quality of the performance. Having said that I really liked the lady below and even if you might see some acts that are rather let's say mediocre it's still a very different night out. I will go again!",

We were surrounded by 2 full walls of antique wood panelling. The large mirror reflected our shiny smiles and the colorful freshness. The music is still there, slightly calmer and discrete :) It is an industrial meets bistro look, hidden on the 1st fl. w/o any signs outdoor...yet as you're up the stairs, the original glass panes from 1930 make Bistrotheque a light and airy space.

    "text": "Bistrotheque is a perennially fashionable bar-performance space- restaurant particular popular during Frieze festival housed in an unlikely backstreet of Bethnal Green.Approaching Bistrotheque there is little to give it away amongst the other warehouses. It is announced by a courtyard with a few smokers and a security guard, which was useful as I had arranged to come here with a bunch of friends to see the Lipsinkers Show.We met (after many phone calls confirming the location) in the bar. The elegant bar is in a narrow building with one row of seating against the wall, with the bar along the other. There is low lighting and the d\u00e9cor is a successful mix between warehouse and upmarket. \u00a0There is a great cocktail list and well stocked bar, which has seemingly contributed to the bar's success. The place has a pleasant, louche ambience. The crowd was fairly mixed, smarter looking people mixed with hipsters. Most people drinking were there for the show.The performance area is next to the bar and is entirely seated. If you're planning to see a show it is worth booking as there are only about 80-100 seats and it often sells out. There's a small bar in here too, although you probably won't get a chance to go to it during the performance (the performance was great and held my attention throughout). There is a cosy, speak-easy atmosphere here which is added to by the bar staff's readiness to keep the bar open for a few after the show ended. I had a great time at the Bistrotheque and look forward to going again. If you're planning to go with a group its worth noting they operate a 'no hen parties, no stags or parties over 10'.",

My partner had the roast chicken. All in all, our opinion converged. Ordinary. Nice service.

    "text": "Delicious. An actual brunch that goes beyond a fry-up or eggs florentine & benedict in London, with the decency to not be over by noon. In fact, it doesn't start till 11, and if you arrive before that on a Sunday you will have no indication from the closed black warehouse shutter that there is a serious restaurant there. Yet it is packed by 12.The birchermuesli was sweetened with an incredible honey that had a toffee undercurrent, the three pancakes were fluffy, and the crumble & custard was delicious.",

Visited recently with my boyfriend and it was an amazing experience. The staff are incredible, dont know how they found such intelligent, kind, polite and yet professional people. They are just enough to make you enjoy your stay and to be satisfied. The decoration is stylish and gives the place a really expensive look. There is a wide range of starters, mains and deserts in the menu, which is designed really nice. Not to forget about the classic wines and other drinks, which are a lot as well. In overall this one of the best restaurants in London, I strongly recommend it!",

    "text": "OK so this is a food review, if it was a cool place review it would be 5 stars, a bar review, probably the same but a Sunday Lunch/Brunch review only 3 stars, sorry. They may well all have been a little hung over from a good Saturday night as that is the only explanation I can think of to explain why the delicious food was let down by two annoying things.Let me start with what I really like \u00a0the venue is just brilliant, real warehouse style, great decor, cool attitude, great design, easy booking, really tasty food, good drinks. In particular I loved the taste of the food I had \u00a0crab salad, black olive gnocchi and a creme brulee, well presented, well seasoned and intelligently put together. The others in our party of five were similarly complimentary and there was not a bad or even average dish amongst all that we ordered.On the down side there were a number of items on the menu not available at 2pm on a Sunday afternoon and we only discovered these by trying to order them a small point but bigger was the idea that 5 gnocchi are sufficient for a main course - a starter maybe but wow, that really is light eating. Particularly mysterious as other mains were a good size or even generous (check out the half roast chicken on the menu!). I was going to say something however our waitress disappeared and that was the other issue \u00a0the service started brightly and was pretty good but then had a major hiccup and at one stage I had to stop a passing waiter and ask for the dessert menu \u00a0suffice to say we felt forgotten.When I mentioned this however the reaction was really positive which shows this is a good place to go \u00a0the desserts were given complimentary and there was an additional discount on the bill when it came.Perhaps I am being a bit harsh with just 3 stars, I will have to go back and try an evening and see what that is like, perhaps I just hit them on an off day. I would definitely recommend it for a cool place to eat and I expect it really is much better than we found it.",

It was absolutely delicious.I've been there before about 8 months ago, but the place has achieved the impossible and seems to have improved when it was already fantastic. \u00a0The ambience of the venue is great with a trendy yet comfortable industrious warehouse feel. The food is delicious. It is not as cheap as other places in the area, but it is worth the expense. The staff are friendly and efficient and despite how busy the place grows, you never have that \"we need to speed up before they usher us out\" feeling. I'm not sure why I don't go there more, I will do from now on. A great find.",

    "text": "I'm not sure if it gets any better than Joseph T's description of \"perennially fashionable.\" I could try to top it, but I'd probably just end up using a thesaurus to come up with awkward replacement phrases like \"ceaselessly newfangled\" or \"imperishably contemporary,\" which sound more like botched plastic surgeries than a delicious savvy incomparable dining experience. So all that said, even with the over-hyped food and mysterious locale, Bistrotheque really delivered. The venue itself oozes cool as the simplistic design of whitewashed brick walls, hanging light bulbs and metal tables direct all of your focus to the food. There are a few other \"atmospheres\" that have been created in the space including a burlesque bar downstairs and an area of dark wood and chandeliers upstairs.However my focus was purely on the food (surprise, surprise...) and it didn't disappoint: fresh fruit infused cocktails were quickly followed by appetizers of fried squid, pigeon breast and pig's head terrine. \u00a0You'd think that after the mention of pig's head my appetite would have disappeared, but it was quite the opposite: as my pork chop arrived, I only briefly wondered if it was from the same miss piggy before diving fork first into my pool of pork-liciousness. (I only came up for air during brief but heavenly sips of my cocktail.) \u00a0Surely a hot spot for romantic dates and groups of foodie friends alike, I would highly recommend experiencing Bistrotheque and all of its glory for yourself. Just make sure you bring your GPS along!",

    "text": "I think people need to come here for the adventure alone - that is if you can find it. Our little group of 4 was trundling all over London in our cab trying to find this place and when we arrived, I think our cabbie was just as excited as we were (mainly because it was a 20+ quid ride). But once you walk through the wee garden you know it's all gonna be worth it. You have your choice of the lovely dark brown bar on the first floor or up the stairs to the restaurant. Or, for the very daring, the \"Burlesque Room\" - but that's for high rollers and let's be honest here, we were starving, so we let our bellies do the leading and rushed up the stairs. The restaurant has a very minimalist feel and you walk through the open kitchen to get to your tables. Really lovely rustic foods but with a twist - and all said and done, a very decent price. We shared the fried squid, pigeon breast and pig's head terrine to start - which were all superb - and for our mains the steak, sea bass, pork chop and lamb. All of us licked our plates so suffice it to say, we were a happy lot. There were a few couples having a romantic tete a tete over a glass of wine, but it also proved the perfect ambiance for our group.I guess as the saying goes, some things are worth the wait (or the hunt!) and Bistrotheque is definitely one of those things. Highly recommended and I will be back (with a GPS) next time I'm across the Pond!",

Being so close to Vyner street, the heart of the East End gallery scene, Bistrotheque attracts an eclectic mix of people, the fashion crowd, artists and regulars combined. \u00a0The building is an old warehouse, and doesn't feel particularly grand as you make your way through the very rough entrance. \u00a0The restaurant upstairs is fairly minimal, with a grand piano in the middle, chandeliers and whitewashed walls. \u00a0 The staff are incredible, very friendly and they certainly know what they're talking about when it comes to the food & wine. \u00a0 The menu is geared up for the meat eaters so being a vegetarian the options are pretty slim. \u00a0The fish is always good though, and everyone raves on about the steak. \u00a0I know that a lot of people go for the fish & chips, so they must be worth a try... maybe next time. The best time to go has to be a Sunday afternoon for brunch. \u00a0Work off that hangover with blueberry pancakes and a bloody mary, while listening to a man playing pop covers on the grand piano.  \u00a0It sounds strange, but seriously, it works.",

It was quite quiet when we went (a Thursday evening) and the surroundings were understated but elegant. Definitely my kind of place to drink.Upstairs, there's the actual restaurant, which has a completely different feel to the bar. It's very modern and \"chic\".

For a Monday night, the place was really pumping, probably more so than any of the other restaurants and bars in the area. It may have had something to do with the fact that it's Christmas time, and Bistroteque can cater for big parties.I had the chilli squid for a starter, which was delicious but quite small. For a main course I had the softest, most amazing steak that I have had for years. Finding a perfect steak just doesn't happen that often, and I was very excited.There are burlesque/cabaret shows down stairs. I didn't go into the show area, but from what I could here from outside, it sounded pretty wild. The place is has a minimal kind of design with a big emphasis on white.

Dark, silent, bit dodgy-looking and positioned next to an imposingly large cash and carry warehouse, you'd be forgiven for scurrying past it quickly, in case some hooded vagrant jumped out at you from the shadows and demanded the last fiver from your man- or handbag. But fear not. An undiscovered Jewel lies down there. Home to both a modern European restaurant (top floor) where you can enjoy a range of delights from huge rock oysters to a traditional roast; and two bars (bottom floor), the smaller brighter one of which is more of a pre-drinksy location, the darker cabaret room being the place that has hosted the shows that have given the place its outrageous yet innovative reputation. If you've never been treated to performances by Laquisha Jonz, Bearlesque (Imagine seductively teasing burlesque performed by fat, hairy gay men), Tranny Lip Synching or Johnny Woo, now is the time to make up for lost time. Fusing cabaret, with stand-up comedy, performance art, song and other things that defy classification, this is definitely the place to go for an evening you'll be laughing to yourself about for weeks afterwards.",

We ate:Starter: Stone bass tartar Main: Sea bream with fennel and orange & the skirt steak with portobello mushrooms and a shallot butter sauceThe starter was nice but nothing special. I've tasted that typical soya ginger chilli sauce in so many dishes before that it didn't come across as anything special for me. The sea bream was a bit too soft, almost mushy, the flavours were rather bland. The skirt steak needed a lot of additional seasoning. It came with a shallot sauce which had only been poured on one slice of the steak leaving the other pieces plain and unloved. Each dish yearned for something else, perhaps a contrasting texture and better seasoning. If I were to come back it would be to sit by the bar with a glass of wine and enjoy the surroundings of this beautiful restaurant.",

So for some strange reason, I got the pancakes (I think I miss maple syrup on occasion). Given all that pancakes and bacon are, I thought this dish was really accurately priced at around \u00a35. I like it when a place acknowledges what a dish is, in spite of the niceness of the decor and surroundings.The live piano music (Lady gaga's hits from last year, arpeggiated and remade into light background music? sure!) is nice, the service (with their iPads) was good, and overall it was a very pleasant experience.

It's hidden because if everyone could find it, I'd never get a table again!Chapter 2: Fresh orange juice, cute menus, amazing options. Let's try them all!

Very hip without being douchey (well, except for the patron with five buttons on his shirt unbuttoned - chest hair! - but I suppose the restaurant can't keep a guy from letting his douche flag fly). The food was great overall. I went for the prix fixe menu, which at just shy of \u00a317.50 was a pretty good deal. Salad was good. My salmon was a bit undercooked for my liking; the server apologised and promptly got me a new fish. (Believe it or not, I don't think the chef, who was visible in their open kitchen, was too impressed with my send-back.) I think it's worthwhile for a restaurant to note in their menu how they cook a meat, especially if they're in the habit of doing it medium rare. Anyway, once the more-cooked salmon came it was delicious, and while I waited the manager brought some tasty salami for us to munch on. Dessert was a rich but delicate creme caramel.We sat at the bar and, naturally, enjoyed a few bevvies on the evening. I had my first Negroni (the thinking man's drink!) and the lady enjoyed their Cucumber Flip and, later on, their Espresso Martini. The Negroni was decent, but I'm not really a mixed drink/ cocktail guy; I would have gone for a beer, but their prices on beers from The Kernel were extortionate. For about 50p more I got the Negroni rather than a Kernel Pale Ale.All in all it was a great evening. Wonderful ambiance, attentive service, pretty good value. I will definitely come back to this place.",

    "text": "Oh baby, the brunch was crazy! (in the best way possible!)I love Eggs Royale. It's safe to say it's one of my favourite dishes ever. Bistrotheque knocked it out of the park. Eggs poached to perfection, a thick and tangy Hollandiase and thick slices of smoked salmon on perfectly toasted muffins.Combined with a reasonably priced pitcher of bellinis (\u00a328.50 and managed to get a good 6 drinks out of it!) that were fabulously made: lots of prosecco and thick raspberry puree, not just a 'hint' of raspberry like the last brunch.The decor was simple-chic and it was quite nice to be nestled away in the corner. The only suggestion I would have is a stronger extractor fan--as we were near the kitchen, we caught very strong whiffs of burnt toast (some rookie...) and it took nearly 20 minutes each time to clear. It did dim the experience a little but not so much that I won't be eager to go back.",

    "text": "Oh-oh Dorothy I don't think we're in North West London any more.Woke up on the wrong side of the Regents Park Canal this morning after a night out. So what better way to christen my newly found one-day status as an EastEnder than to visit East's fashionable restaurant Bistrotheque for brunch. \u00a0Luckily my friend Al was on hand to indulge my fancy, so off we hopped down Cambridge Heath Road. The place itself is in a converted clothing factory, hidden on a side-street, amongst Cash 'n' Carries and warehouses. It's not very obvious to spot - fine in the daylight, but perhaps a wee bit off-putting to find alone during the dark disco-hours. The entrance is unmarked- but you can hear the chatter from the downstairs bar on the road, and you know you are in the right place. Once inside, and in the upstairs' restaurant we were greeted by a rather cool looking ma\u00eetre d', with oversized med-jar specs. We had been told to book, and so were ushered to our seats very quickly. Although the restaurant did appear busy there did seem to be a few empty tables available for on-the-fly visitors too.The restaurant itself is nice and bright. The walls are whitewashed and the ceilings are covered in industrial looking pipes. The temperature felt slightly warm so I had to strip off a layer, not an easy task as the layer in question was underneath my dress. Although cabaret is held downstairs in the venue, there are limits to my burlesque behaviour - so I have to clarify I did this change in the loos.One look at the menu and it was 'See you later brunch' - it was lunch all the way baby. It was hard to say no - three courses off the set lunch menu comes in at a reasonable \u00a321. If ordering off the standard lunch menu, bear in mind the food is seasonal and varies- my waitress crossed off at least half off the dishes of the normal lunch menu. The food was great value, delicious and amazing quality. Lovely salad to start, then succulent roast beef with trimmings for mains. I'm quite new to eating red-meat after years of abstaining, and I have been disappointed with all the roast beef dishes I have since eaten. However I found this gorgeous and enjoyed the added goodness of the caramelized onions in the gravy. Dessert for my friend was strawberry pavlova and for myself a cr\u00e8me brule, we found both immensely satisfying. Our friendly waitress even remarked that she had never seen a ramekin as clean as mine, and asked if I had licked it. I deny this, it was purely spoon scraping, honest gov. Our waitress also had draped on her person an illustrated tea towel specially commissioned for Bistrotheque and available to buy, however although extremely cool I declined - 6 towels for \u00a330 was still a bit pricey. In fact more than dinner itself.Lunch was just what I needed to defeat the going-out induced hunger. Singer and musician Bishi also agrees as I spotted her settling down to a meal. Whilst snooping at other people's food on their tables I could see that it is definitely worth another visit for brunch - the pancakes and the eggs Florentine looked fantastic. I will be back. One complaint though - 7 hours later and I'm still not hungry. Which is a shame, you may have gathered, I do rather like eating.",

Just.Brunch portions were definitely on the small end of the scale, and managed to sate only with a few side dishes. The food was above average, but then again, so was the price. Having said that, while runny yolks are a must, some of the poached eggs were actually a bit undercooked for my liking.The service was fair, but not without very minor niggles: the water never arrived, the tea and coffee came without milk and getting the bill was a challenge.Still, the pianist was fun. And the dinner menu looks interesting. I'll give it a whirl one evening.",

We went for a Sunday brunch and had an excellent selection of dishes ranging from the mini fois gras burger (lovely, perfect size), to oysters (apparently very good) and salted caramel tart. At no point did we feel rushed and the waiter was just the right level of attentive.I would give 5 stars, but it is just a touch expensive what for is really just quite simply cooked food and standard ingredients, but really is a lovely alternative brunch option.

The restaurant is hard to find, yes it's one of \"those\" places like Please Don't Tell in NYC. Sure that's part of the fun, but we ended up blowing 20 quid on the taxi ride (why don't all taxi drivers have GPS, we were going around in circles at one point). Ambiance was somewhat minimalist, cool but a bit cold. The tables were simple marble tops and the walls were all white. Service was good, but the real standout was the food. I started with the spicy squid for an app and had the sea bass as my main. Both were absolutely excellent dishes, very delicate with complex flavors and perfect texture. Definitely a restaurant worth going out of your way for.",

The pure white warehouse style decor is very cool but the club downstairs is really where all the action happens! This venue has a range of cabaret shows ranging from burlesque to drag and everything cool and funky in between. We saw an amazing burlesque show - very entertaining and the mojito cocktails definitely help you on your way to having a great night!The crowd is generally very cool - you tend to see groups of arty fashionistas and all the too cool for skool type celebrities and DJ's. Definitely worth a visit but make sure you're up for a lively night. No wall flowers allowed!",

    "text": "Situated down a pretty horrid side street in the industrial area of Bethnal Green is this cool little haunt compromises of a bar, two dining areas and \u00a0a cabaret club. It's in a converted factory and the inside of the main restaurant is still pretty stark, but they've made the most of the big spaces and the dark wood and bright white walls cut a clean edge. If you head for the bar you're met with a completely different style with a very narrow room, minimally lit, far darker and more seductive. The velvet stools lining up and the gorgeous bar mirror are so nice. I've tried out the bar before dining and the setting certainly enhances your mood along with the rest of the typically East crowd who hang out there. Design wise it's an inviting space, but the crowd does have an air of exclusivity about them that I can imagine may put some people off. But then again, they don't take reservations for the bar tables which is good. Choose the cocktails if you're going to drink as most off the classic list have an appealing little twist. The Espresso Nut Martini is just one of my favourites. The food is a suave Anglo-French affair and is moderately priced. It changes seasonally and last time we went I played it safe and has the gnocchi that was perfectly cooked. They mentioned that the menu was changing again early December so I'm looking forward to what Christmas offerings they'll come up with. The room is so attractive that I really like it here, the baby grand in the corner is just so sexy.Oh I should also mention that this place is most famous for the cabaret nights, with drag and other such spectacles happening in the cosy, candle lit cabaret room. I haven't tried these out yet as, but apparently they're sophisticated fun not to be missed.Although for such a damn cool place, which is obviously working hard to attract (and welcome) a certain crowd, I do wonder what they were thinking when they decided on the uber tacky name. Ah well, it's comforting to know that even Bistroteque have their bad days.",

During this first visit as well as multiple future visits I have been eating my way through the brunch menu and been very impressed by a lot of the options. My favourites are the rhubarb pancakes (probably the biggest portion size of the whole menu!) as well as the avocado & poached eggs (I love cornbread and the eggs are poached to perfection!). While the food is amazing, the service can be very hit-and-miss. Mostly my issue with the service was just that I had to ask multiple times for some tap water for the table. However, on my latest visit I was really put off by how clearly the waiter tried to turn around our table as quickly as possible. I had a reservation for 11am. The second we were seated the waiter hovered to take our order. Shortly before noon our plates were almost ripped out of our hands even though I was still eating and the second the plates were cleared the bill landed on our table. I understand that busy places try to turn tables around for another brunch seating, but I don't think it is ok to rush people out after just an hour.",

Unfortunately, the cabaret closed a year or more ago and the pianist only plays on the weekends..... STILL... Was a brilliant meal out for all!Service was slow (pre dinner cocktails took 20 mins plus for example) so why 5 stars I hear you ask.....The ice cream.But, before I come to that I should say I think the burger here is one of the best I've had outside of America. The beef is freshly ground steak meat but done the day before so whilst they won't do you a rare burger they will do it medium rare and its oh so juicy and goooood! I'm seriously fussy about my burgers - the bun was amazingly fresh and doughy and the Gorgonzola was awesome all melty in there...The chicken looked pretty cool too - I stole a bit of my friends but was too distracted by my awesome burger to take any photos - sorry!So, anyway, back to the real deal - THE ICE CREAMI just was minding my own business ordering the banana and peanut sponge with dulce de leche sauce and as an after thought asked for a scoop of the homemade Icecream on the side.......It arrives, I have a little spoon of the ice cream before attacking the very nice looking sponge and BAM. Oh. My. God. It was like they took the best vanilla Icecream in the world and the whipped clotted cream into it and then thought, I know lets whip some liquid meringue/marshmallowey stuff into it too. I seriously was blown away. I gave my pudding to a friend and proceeded to order 2 portions of just the Icecream and then sat there making funny noises ignoring everyone else at the table. When I woke up the next morning, the first thing I did was check out deliveroo and just eat to see if I could order 3 portions of Icecream to my home the next day.The food here is really good but seriously, that vanilla icecream...... I'll be going back and ordering 3 portions sometime soon...I think I have a problem....",

    "text": "5 stars for ambiance.Service was average - service was impersonal and felt rushed and tough to pin down a waiter to ask for things (e.g. more tap water, condiments, etc) especially given they tack on a service charge on your bill.Food quality was hit / miss. \u00a0Went there for brunch for my Dad's birthday. \u00a0Here are a few thoughts on what we ordered. \u00a0Starters1. \u00a0Labneh was excellent - very good flavor profile. \u00a0Well executed - was not served with any bread (although bread available complimentary upon order) - this was probably the best dish we had.2. \u00a0Charred asparagus - asparagus were on the smaller end and hollandaise was good whilst difficult to tell what to do with egg yolk (execution was mediocre).Waited a long time (30+ minutes) for the mains to come out even though the restaurant wasn't busy. \u00a0All the waiters seem to congregate around the bar / kitchen but really not much service other than random shouts of orders from the chef (common in kitchens which gives it a real cool feel).Mains1. \u00a0Fish and Chips - batter on fish was soft and was fried until almost burned as an effort to cook it - it was still uncooked. \u00a0Served with chips (which are double fried served on side) and mushy peas. \u00a0Would suggest they serve a small green salad with this like a few mesclun greens to balance the meal. \u00a0It felt like the dish wasn't fully put together. \u00a0This fish and chips could've been executed much better without much additional effort with nothing to differentiate it from other fish and chip dishes at other establishments.2. \u00a0Avocado poached eggs. \u00a0Two words- disorganized mess. \u00a0Not sure how I was supposed to eat this. \u00a0It was basically unseasoned cornbread topped with 2 poached eggs, avocado smash (which was over processed into a baby pur\u00e9e) with an entire bush of coriander (coriander wasn't cut up so there were stems and everything). \u00a0There was a puddle of Tabasco on the side which didn't help the fish at all as the cornbread base sucked up the spice. \u00a0Too many strong flavors on a plate with no cohesiveness. \u00a0The avocado smash is probably some of the worst I've had, unfortunately.3. \u00a0Chicken - pan seared leg, thigh and wing (cheap cuts that can withstand overcooking). \u00a0Skin was tough and not crispy. \u00a0This was served with an arugula salad. \u00a0Again, the presentation wasn't great and the dish was very underwhelming. Drinks1. \u00a0Santa Clara was good - could be served in a highball instead of an old fashioned glass.2. Americano was luke warm when I received it. \u00a0Wasn't a good brunch roast.3. \u00a0English breakfast tea was served loose leaf which was nice.Overall I gave this place 3* based on the ambiance which trumps the downside of the food / service experience. \u00a0Unlikely to recommend.",

    "text": "Bistrotheque's brunch and dinner are both excellent. \u00a0While hard to spell and hard to find (keep going, it's down there on the left, welcome to Tower Hamlets) the service is impeccable and from experienced hands.The restaurant is on the upper floor of a large late 20th century light industrial unit. \u00a0The sort of thing that, in this part of London, was surely built where a bomb once fell. \u00a0The building was reborn as service industry space in the early 2000s and originally planned as a multi-purpose gallery and restaurant. \u00a0It is now exclusively the latter. \u00a0The internal doors are glazed with square-grid wire reinforced glass, the external window panes are held in with original hand-set putty, and the concrete floor is marked with paint and dents from a former life. \u00a0All very authentic, and the restaurant space itself is respectful to the building's origins: kitchen, bar, piano stage and dining area are all built into one very large room. \u00a0If you look above the kitchen you'll see it's just a partitioned off area. \u00a0The metal-truss roof is exposed with naked white-painted ducting visible from edge-to-edge in the style of modern open plan spaces. \u00a0If it weren't a restaurant this would probably be a software startup's offices.The bar is a large oval pit with iron sculptures and seating for around 25 people, offering space for walk-in diners and the best view into the kitchen. \u00a0You can make table reservations as well and we ate at the tables in the seated space. \u00a0The white-paper table cloths have important and pithy life advice written on them of which you should take note.Brunch is incredibly popular here, and with such a large space turnover is rapid and you won't have to wait long even at 11am on a Sunday morning. \u00a0I had eggs benedict: cooked properly with a sauce on the lighter end of the spectrum and surprise spinach accompanying the ham, and on good chewy sourdough toast. \u00a0Very well plated. \u00a0My fellow diners had the slap-up Bistrotheque breakfast, a modest example of a full English that subs out your regular starchy-thing and replaces it with what must be deep-fried potatoes gratin. \u00a0They call it \"layered potato\" and it's a thing of golden brown beauty but also a bit like eating a pile of crisps. \u00a0No slur on the excellent dish, but if you insist on eating with cutlery expect one in five attempts at cutting to result in an explosion of potato bits pinging across the room. \u00a0Don't be embarrassed if this happens -- look at the floor around other tables and you'll see you aren't the first. \u00a0Brunch drinks and coffee excellent and a pianist was present. \u00a0Conversations were interspersed with \"is he playing Supergrass?\" and similar questions. \u00a0The music catered for those who grew up in the 90s.Dinner a few weeks later was Mersea Island oysters (from the Thames estuary in Essex, not the Liverpool homonym), salt cod brandade (a kind of rillette), steak tartare, cod and chips, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and chocolate pudding. \u00a0We also had a glass of sweet PX sherry, one of Bistrotheque's Dilligint cocktails -- a close relative of the G&T made with house tonic and dill -- and a bottle of Vin de Pays d'Oc viognier. \u00a0The fish batter was crispy without pinging around the room when you cut into it. \u00a0The steak tartare was generous, hand chopped and chunky, with a good strong mustard tang. \u00a0The other star of the meal was the salty ice cream that came with the choice pudding. \u00a0An absolutely embarrassing amount of food and drink for two people, so \u00a3130-service-included seemed extremely reasonable. \u00a0They have Gelas Armagnac here but we had to be responsible: the walk home was along the canal.(ps: Thursdays evenings are currently special fish nights. \u00a0The culinary team do a trip out to the fish docks that morning and serve up what they find for dinner in the bar area. \u00a0Sometimes a drag cabaret accompanies. \u00a0It'll be the next thing we try here.)",

Bistrotheque is proof that chefs are modern-day clerics- if you stir the right things together, they'll put me under a spell. You know my favorite brunch combo is bloody mary + oysters + eggs benedict (and mac and cheese where available), so it's what I set out to try here. Easily the best eggs benedict I've had... possibly ever. A lovely, buttery sauce, nice little jersey rocks to start, a well-made drink... I really don't have any complaints. The creme brulee had a brulee to win all brulees with vanilla seeds at the bottom for a little surprise. We caught the tail-end of the live piano music and got to hang out for a little longer than we were probably supposed to have the table for as they were changing over for dinner and it was a perfect Sunday in East London. I absolutely love it, despite my friends-that-can't-use-google-maps' complaints, I would be perfectly happy to become a fixture that props up the walls on a regular basis.",

    "text": "I was questioning my Google Maps as I walked down Wadeson Street. There were no signs of any public businesses, just warehouses and flats. As my blue dot was reaching the flagged address on my app, I could hear the sounds of a restaurant but couldn't see any sign of an entrance anywhere. I decided to do a little more investigating and found an open door. A man emerged and told me that Bistrotheque was upstairs and I headed right on up. What I found was a welcoming open space and a very friendly staff. I had a 11:15AM brunch reservation for 3 and they happily walked me to my table.If I had to guess, Bistrotheque seems to be a well-kept secret since you have to be looking for it in order to find it. It's not on a main street where many people walk by so it's not likely that you'll just stumble upon it. As I was waiting for my friends to arrive, a member of the staff took my drink order and asked if I'd like a newspaper while I waited, which I thought was very thoughtful on his behalf. When my friends finally arrived, we decided to share an order of the pancakes, maple syrup, and bacon and each got a dish of our own. I decided to stray away from my typical order of some type of eggs benedict and went with the unique duck hash which was recommended to me by the server.When the food finally arrived, we all decided to share amongst eachother so I got a bite of everyone's dish. The food was very good and overall it was a very good brunch. The pancakes were the highlight for me and thought it was a good idea for all of us to share alongside our own personal brunch dishes. The duck hash was good, but I wasn't amazed by it. Aside from brunch, their dinner menu looked amazing so I may be tempted to head back to try it. As for the atmosphere, this may be the first time I've listened to a live piano player as I was chowing down on brunch. Bistrotheque is great little find in an area you'd never think to find a nice restaurant. Just a piece of advice, if your map app tells you you're in the right place, you probably are... just look for a set of doors and find your way upstairs.",

(or, possibly: butter AND cheese...AND cream?), and the duck confit, though also tasty, was extraordinarily rich. \u00a0If I had gone to Bistrotheque with the expectation of a French restaurant (its cuisine is categorized as \"French\" on Yelp), I would have been disappointed. \u00a0The real highlights, for me, were the space itself, the staff, and the drinks. \u00a0On that alone, I'm willing to give the mains a re-try, especially since the night pre-Christmas feels unfairly unrepresentative of an average service. \u00a0Have heard the brunch is killer, so that's on my stomach's bucket list. \u00a0Yelp note: who'd ha' thunk that cream, creme de cacao and tequila would make an awesome cocktail? \u00a0YOU'RE WELCOME, LIVER!",

Not only is it in a random sort of area, but the fact that you have to walk down an alley to enter just contributes to the overall vibe that it presents. I was in awe of the open-ness and beauty of the space, and it just had a great vibe that is very rare to find. I will definitely be coming here any time I find myself in London.",
