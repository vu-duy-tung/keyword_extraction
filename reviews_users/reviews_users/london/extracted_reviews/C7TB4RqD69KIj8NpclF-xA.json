    "text": "I discovered this place a few months ago, and keep coming back. The upstairs cafe is great for lunch. There is a regular menu, but usually get tempted by the 'specials', which focus on using seasonal produce. I also really enjoy the mezze, fish and charcuterie platters, which are great shared with a friend over a bottle of wine. (charged at retail price - excellent!). The downstairs shop is fantastic for browsing afterwards. Lots of interesting jars of olive oils etc. Recently they have added their own lines to the range, and the natural kitchen piccalilli is now a staple in my fridge! The meat counter is as good as i've found in London, the pies and chicken kievs well worth taking home for a quick dinner. There is loads more for me to explore here, as have yet to eat downstairs, or try their cakes! So will be back soon!! Highly recommended!",

    "text": "Marylebone High Street is owned by an aristocratic family, who are selective in who they allow to operate on the street. As a result the street is home to many independent, high-end shops. The Natural Kitchen is a typical example of this. It is an organic food shop/cafe that sells a limited but diverse range of goods from around the world. As one would expect it is all fairly expensive, though seemingly justifiably so. I was on Marylebone High Street at the weekend with my sister, doing some Christmas shopping, and we stopped in at the Natural Kitchen for some late lunch. There seem to be three floors. The ground floor has some tables amongst the food stands and a few counters; cheese, meat, oils, etc. The basement floor has more food and the first floor is the cafe. The cafe is a decent size with quite a lot of chairs and tables. We sat near the back window and were promptly served. I had a rare steak sandwich and a cappuccino. The coffee was okay and the sandwich was real good. The meat was of a high quality and cooked as described. The bread was fresh with a good crust. The only downfall was I made a bit of a hash of eating it as I wasn't sure whether to use the knife and fork or just hands. My sister had a coffee and a Croque Monsieur, which was done properly with Bechamel sauce. It came as \u00c2\u00a320 for the both of us, which is expensive, but \"justifiably so.\" A great shop to buy presents, some choice items or just to stop in for a good quality snack.",

From meat to cheese to packaged treats, you're sure to find something delicious you can take home and claim as your own.Case in point: Today they had an entire free range chicken for 10 pounds. \u00a310! I opted out of the effort that would have taken and picked up two chicken burger patties instead (\u00a31.50 each!) as well as some side salads and sweet treats and subsequently blew everyone away with my 'home-cooked' meal. The secret's always in the sourcing, right?",

They have a great juice bar: both ready made and 'choose your own ingredients'-- but don't get too excited there, you might end up with a mighty blend of gag! other than lovely cakes, which are quite overpriced, they also offer this amazing cup of bite-size cakes that carries all the variaties they have in store. \u00a31.95, well, always better than paying \u00a34 just to realized you're not in the mood for a creamy slice of carrot cake (wait, I don't even think that's possible). anyway, natural kitchen carries a clean wholesome feeling offering anything from gourmet to ready made to 'quickie lunchies and munchies'. small strip of outdoor seating, and more cafe like seatings inside and upstairs.a salad lunch deals range from around \u00a37-\u00a39, lovely quiches and pies, fish, and overpriced salad options. the best bet for a quick lunch option would be their pint sized 'ready made' salad cups-- especially the one with crayfish+rocket and pasta. p.s., they have more than 3 kinds of coconut water (to those up for the hype) and some magical bottles of cold press juices.",

    "text": "I had such high hopes for my lunch from The Natural Kitchen when I picked up the cardboard takeaway box and it weighed roughly the heft of brick. The thought of that much mass going down my gut had me salivating.Then I actually tucked into my spinach Greek pie, Greek salad, and lentil salad and realised I was sorely mistaken. Honestly, I'm not sure how it's even -possible- to make a Greek salad so tasteless. Typically, cucumbers have a refreshing zest to them, olives add a briny counterbalance to the dulcet tomatoes, and fatty pungent feta rounds out the smorgasbord of flavours. Though the textures were all spot on, this was readily the most bland Greek salad I can ever remember consuming.Similarly, the lentil salad was perfectly textured; if legumes can be qualified as al dente, these would be the epitome of al dente-ness. Sadly, that's about all I can say in their favour. Again, I might as well have been eating lentil-shaped cardboard for all the taste sensation I could detect. I've never wanted some bright olive oil and sharp balsamic so badly.The spinach pie was nominally better. At least it tasted like -something- as opposed to -nothing-. It was honestly a relief from the humdrum of the rest of my meal.If I was a total health nut, I'd probably be all over this stuff, but I actually enjoy eating tasty food, even if that means it has unnecessary calories attached to it. Though the value of a takeaway lunch here is grand, I wouldn't spring at an opportunity to dine from here again.",

I eventually opted for some olives and a fennel tea, after asking the waitress if the poached salmon was wild, or farmed and being told it was 'organic' but she didn't know where from. \u00a0But rather than telling me they didn't know, she went off on one saying it wasn't possible to know where the Salmon came from.. A real shoddy response for a place that's claiming to be a 'natural' kitchen.. Apparently as long as you use the word 'organic' it appears to be enough for most people :( well not this Paleo eating diner, who wants to know what their food was fed before it reached my plate.Well anyways, aside from not being open or honest, about the source of their food, which understandably probably doesn't matter to 99% of the population, when they did bring the tea, it was filled so much that a little of it splashed out of the teapot, or perhaps that's just how the teapot is, as it did drip a little when I poured out the fennel tea.. As for the olives.. I hadn't asked for any 'stuffed' olives, and whilst most were just regular olives with stones, the first was really strong with a bit of marinated garlic in it and further down, there was one with a pimento jn it, which would have been ok, except it was a little overly marinated, and the olives tasted a little bitter..If you eat meat, bread, dairy, and don't care about your organic food not being grass fed, or wild salmon, then I'm sure the other food is probably ok, but if you're eating Paleo, and want to be sure of where your food comes from, then like for me, this may not be the place for you :(",

Personal Amanda problems aside, Natural Kitchen still has lovely salad options and delicious juices-galor. I did finally manage to eat upstairs for their brunch, my only complaint being they put us down for the wrong time even though I checked twice. But come on, no-one died over that. Anyway, the brunch options were good and the food was delish as well. It's a solid place to stop for a nice refreshing breakfast, brunch, or lunch.",

It's an overwhelming place -- especially with all the lunchers buzzing about, circling the cases, grabbing the goodies and scouring for seats. Frantic. This isn't going to be a leisurely lunch. On my next visit, I'd get it all to take away and visit a park or take it back to my office. I enjoyed the schnitzel + array of side salads (squash, quinoa, beets) -- lovely. For dessert a small pudding cup with crushed oreos, and to drink a lemonade. I was very content! They have a large selection of cold prepared salads, hot food, cooler sandwiches, drinks, etc. The combinations they offer are a bit convoluted -- my dining partner received a very small box of salad, didn't realize there were other options and it could've been more clear what was what. The ordering and paying process is a bit confusing, but all good. It all worked out in the end because I got to eat. The que situation is random. I had to bus my own table, yet there are no rubbish bins anywhere to do so. It's frantic but the food is good -- if you are ambling about Marylebone High Street in off hours, definitely pop in. If you are going for lunch, prepare yourself and get in and get out.",

We passed a variety of fancier places along the way but when we saw Natural Kitchen, the food looked and smelled amazing so had to give it a try. I ordered oatmeal where you can put anything you would like in it. It was so fresh, dairy free, and cheap! \u00a0The texture was great and the fresh fruit and honey made the flavor pop. I also ordered a custom smoothie from the juice bar. The options of juice combos were endless but I loved my mango, banana, strawberry, chia seed with apple juice combo. They people were friendly and the people working there were kind and patient as they waited for each of us to decide on what we wanted to mix into our master piece. I liked that you can order your food and pay and sit down in the back where its a very casual setting. We were able to catch up and there was plenty of space to find a seat. If i came back i would have to try the array of lunch items. This place is a deli as well with dozens of options for each and every food category. Salads, meats, sandwiches, anti-pastas, etc. \u00a0I recommend checking this place out for a casual meet up with food that wont leave you feeling guilty!",

When you have take-out...Uli B: I see.My dear Natural Kitchen - I've been really trying to like you. In fact, I've come to visit you three times, just to make sure that I'm not writing an unbalanced review about you, but I simply have to say that every time you have simply not met my expectations: 1) I came for brunch with a few friends. You were very crowded and your wait staff was overwhelmed, unfriendly & unprofessional. I know it's very hard to be popular and thus very busy, but please, don't give me an attitude...plus, your Egges Benedict were not that good either!2) I came because another Yelper mentioned that your take-away salads were really great. In fact, I was ready to forgive you for your misbehaviour during my first visit. And wow, your salad selection does really look impressive - I felt like I was already purified with healthy goodness just by looking at the salads on display. But you let me down again!!! Believe it or not, but the salads didn't have any flavour at all...you know how it is, when you have a stuffed nose and everything tastes the same? This is what your salads tasted like! Seriously, I had three different kinds and non of them tasted majorly different from each other...3) How does the saying go? First time, shame on you, second time shame on me and third time... While the flavours of the salads had slightly improved during my third visit, the incident with the \"pasty-tax\" just made me not want to come back to you at all anymore...I'm sorry, while it might be the law, it seems like you are the only business that seems to adhere to it!",

The falafel was slightly dry but the hummus was faultless.I must give a special shout out to the tuna and cucumber sandwich - line caught tuna and mayonnaise with sliced cucumber on granary bread - which is nothing short of superb.The Natural Kitchen's the place you want to lunch if you've been indulging too frequently in pub (or other) excesses.

I really didn't like the quinoa salad and the buckwheat salad wasn't much better - no real flavour. Also didn't really like their spinach quiche but I think that might be more down to my personal taste.Like one of the other reviewers, I was surprised that the staff didn't look a bit happier to be working here. They weren't very friendly or particularly polite and took a while to clock that standing in front of the counter selecting salads meant we wanted to buy something.All basically forgiven because of the milkshake.

    "text": "You know when you've gone to a place and think the other branches should be just as good... so you insist to your boyfriend that that's where you need to have brunch? \u00a0This is one of those stories where you end up apologizing because it was not very good.Downstairs things were buzzing, but the tables at the back were free and the food as we walked along looked lovely, but we were after breakfast. \u00a0Up the stairs we went to an extremely busy \"cafe\". \u00a0We got a table, which was too small for Mr. Snarky to put his legs under, so he sat at a 45 degree angle. \u00a0Already I was feeling very bad about this. \u00a0\"Our\" waitress came over to give us menus and then came back to take our order. \u00a0I had the chorizo with a poached egg and Mr. Snarky had the Eggs Benny. \u00a0He had orange juice while I had apple juice.The reason I put quotation marks around \"our\" is that the two waitresses were in training and seemed to just drop one task to take care of another task. \u00a0So what was happening is that the kitchen was backing up with food to be served while they were busy setting empty tables. \u00a0On more than one occasion, I heard the chef (the kitchen is open to the dining room) yell service and no one ever came. \u00a0In fact, when he did it for our food, he gave up and just brought it out to us so it wouldn't go stone cold. \u00a0We also ordered juice which we had to waive someone down for and ask if we were going to get them before we were finished with our food.The food looked nice, but if you are particularly hungry, it isn't super filling and I can't say that I was very impressed with what we had. \u00a0Not sure how Mr. Snarky's Eggs Benny was, but mine was really just a small poached egg, two slices of granary toast, and four, paper thin slices of chorizo. \u00a0Our plates were cleared by the host, who seemed to be trying to cover everything that the waitresses were not doing. \u00a0But he disappeared before we got the chance to ask for the bill. \u00a0We sat for awhile and realized that we could easily walk out without anyone ever noticing. \u00a0However, I was looking around for one of the staff and the host must have seen my annoyed look as he asked across a couple of tables if he could get me something. \u00a0We received the bill and of course there was the discretionary service charge. \u00a0And while this was one of those times where it would have been completely within reason to not pay the charge, I figured it would take even longer to sort through the mess that would cause, so I paid it.The sad thing is I had build this up to Mr. Snarky because of my experience at a different branch. \u00a0The food was amazing and service wasn't half bad either (it wasn't particularly busy). \u00a0So this was a bit of a let down and I ended up apologizing to Mr. Snarky for the build up and not delivering.",
