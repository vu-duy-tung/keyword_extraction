    "text": "I came here with a group of 5 girls on a rainy weekday evening after work for some sushi & sake combo (well it was gin actually but you get the jist) and this place was perfect for this purpose. Firstly the place is huge but still oddly cosy which is great when you want to talk freely without eves droppers. The atmosphere is a mix of professionals and creatives which makes you feel hip and the service seemed busy but the right level of attentive. The food was AWESOME! Sushi can be hard to great right but I loved the slight twist on standard dishes (grilled edamame - why hasn't it happened before?!) with the platters a great selection for when you're so hungry you can't choose. The price point was right with it costing \u00a350 for 3 courses, a cocktail each & some wine. I plan to bring the hubby here for one of our date nights, he definitely won't leave hungry!",

Don't worry you may like the food here if you like English's fish and chips!

You have already reached the hearts of more people than I would ever want, with my mentioning your name to my friends and them already knowing about you and they say they will join you soon....The first time I savoured your food I thought I had died and gone to heaven. Literally I was about to cry because the sushi was so fresh, the service was so amazing, from the warm napkins handed to me at the start, to the free water given to me without prompts, to the great explanations of which cocktail to choose when I said I wanted something sweet.If you too would like to join me in my love quest to Sticks N Sushi, I would recommend you order the Ultimate (enough for two), make sure you go on a weekday night (for fresh fish, do not go at weekends), and seriously, enjoy everything from the service to the food.If you order matcha, they do the tea ceremony in front of you. How can romance not blossom in this fabulous establishment from Copenhagen?I'm in love. I might just marry this restaurant for the food.",

The sushi rice was overly moist and slightly too heavy and definitely hadn't been prepared to any decent standard. The sashimi was served extremely cold so the taste of the fish was very muted. The Yakitori was good, particularly the tsukne (chicken meatball) which was very good. They didn't bring out part of my order but it wasnt on my cheque so no harm no foul. Service was a little disjointed but the people there are really wonderful. There must be better sushi in London than this, as for Yakitori it's good but my search for a Yakitori restaurant to replace the outstanding (and now closed) Bincho must continue.",

After a quick glance at the menu outside we decided it was worth a shot.A chain serving sushi and yakitori platters, Sticks n Sushi started in Denmark and this is their second London branch. It's lovely inside - dim, music isn't too loud and tables aren't crammed too close together. The staff were very friendly too - we were made very comfortable and welcome (and one waitress even stopped to compliment my homemade flower brooch!).Now the food. We decided to order the 'Table for 2' sticks n sushi platter which is a selection of sushi rolls and yakitori sticks served with all the appropriate embellishments and dips. It took a little while for our food to arrive, but it was all fresh and delicious when it did. We were told the providence of all of the seafood in our sushi. Believe me when I say everything was DELICIOUS! This type of food is deceptive - because everything is served to you in little bites you don't realise how much you've eaten until you are rolling out of the restaurant, fit to burst. This worked out about \u00a330 each for the platter, drinks and tip.Definitely one I'll make a return visit to.",

    "text": "Quick glance:+ beautiful menu+ beautiful sushi+ patient and attentive staff+ good decor and atmosphere- Soho pricesFull review:A friend invited me to lunch at Sticks N Sushi after she missed visiting the original concept in Denmark. So there you have it, it's a Danish import and hence why you'll find quite a few Danish beer on the menu. The restaurant has a hipster feel to it, in a positive way, giving it a good ambiance. The menu is beautiful - every item has a picture and laid out like a guidebook rather than a normal menu one would scan from top to bottom, left to right. It was distracting at time as my eyes dart from picture to picture, but I enjoyed the novel experience. The food that arrived at our table looked as beautiful as the ones pictured in the menu. The flavour of the sushi wasn't mind-blowing, but they tasted good and looked even better. On the other hand, the beef we had came with a wonderful sauce, and the dessert I had (black sesame ice cream) was packed with flavour. The staff was very attentive to allergies requirements and double checked with the kitchen to make sure we don't ingest anything we shouldn't. The only downside is the Soho prices, roughly \u00a330 each for lunch (a plate of beef, two plates of sushi, two desserts and one tea), but it is worth a treat. Overall, a great place to catch up with friends over some visually enticing food.",

    "text": "Summary: + Fresh sushi and Japanese skewer grills+ Tasteful interior and excellent food presentation Sticks N Sushi is a restaurant chain from Denmark that serves quality Japanese food in a stylish space that is characterised by its chic minimalist interiors. As the name suggests, they specialise in sushi and sticks (skewers). The dishes are served with elegant presentation. \u00a0The restaurant in Covent Garden was pretty busy when we arrived for a little late lunch (2-ish) on a weekend. Since we had reserved a table beforehand, we were shown to our group table without a hassle. We ordered one shared board each from sushi and sticks sections and a few small dishes. My miso soup came in a china bowl with an old-school wooden top. (See photo) The sticks (skewers) board, which consisted of chicken, pork and salmon with veggie sticks as side. The sweetened miso-based dip sauce which accompanied the sticks board was very tasty. The sushi board consisted of salmon carpaccio, cucumber and crab meat roll, duck roll, as well as the usual nigiri sushi. This board was served with a slightly spicy mayo-based dip sauce. Overall, the food was delicious and presented beautifully. I particularly liked the elegant but functional approach to presentation with no gimmicks. This place is not cheap but definitely worth a visit when you want to treat yourself with fresh Japanese food in style.",

The ingredients were very fresh which I appreciated. However, perhaps it was too fresh -- the rolls disintegrated very easily and I would have expected better, neater rolls than that from a restaurant of this price range.Service, once again, was very disorganised. They messed up my friend's plate, and it took them some prodding to finally bring it out. Ambience was quite nice. A bit noisy, but posh enough for dates. I'd go back to try out some of the other dishes -- the menu looked good. I do hope their service will have improved by then.",

    "text": "I am an avid lover of SUSHI! I was recommended Sticks and Sushi by a friend, again very chic and modern (slightly pretentious). Cocktails are lovely, mostly made with Japanese influenced alcohol, including sake. There is a lot of varieties on the menu from ramen to raw fish sushi and steak fillet sushi. For starters I had the scallops placed in a light batter with a mustard base sauce. Very pleasing for the pallet.The food is beautiful presented, for mains we ordered a variety of sushi fish based mains. I'd personally pick out a dish on every page of the menu to give yourself variety and a choice of flavours. Throughly enjoyed my experience and the food was definitely vibrant and flavoursome. HIGHLY recommend sushi lovers to visit, the only downside to the restaurant is that is very pricey.Don't be afraid to add a pinch of wasabi to your sushi!",

Our waitress walked us through the extensive menu, made some suggestions, and continued to check back in on us throughout the meal. Can't say anything bad about the staff or the service. Things that were just \"okay\": The food. My boyfriend and I split the tuna tartare, which didn't taste like a whole heck of a lot. In fact, it sort of tasted like it has been sitting in a refrigerator for a while. The tuna as well wasn't a great cut, it was hard to pull it into bit size pieces. My boyfriend ordered one of the sushi platters. He said it was \"pretty good\". It wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. I ordered a few of the \"sticks\" - oysters wrapped in bacon, grilled vegetables, and salmon. The oysters came without the bacon, and instead of a \"miso butter\" were smothered in teryaki sauce. So was the rest of it. I was hoping for that smoky Japanese grill taste but it was really just speared meat and vegetables slathered in really sweet teryaki. I was kinda bummed. All in all, it was affordable and the service was prompt, but the food was just average. Beats the other chains in the tourist swarmed Covent Garden area but I wasn't mega",

The lowdown as follows: had a crapton of sashimi, because carbs before marbs are the death of my social life, and it was sensational. Also had a few \"sticks\" and non sushi items, including this cauliflower thing with truffle that was excellent, and a lamb with miso and butter stick (very good) a beef with garlic stick (good, tad chewy), an emmenthal and bacon (oh mother) and some rolls, including the Shake Daikon (good) and a hell's kitchen roll. Now I'm reading all of this, and what the actual fuck did I write that whole thing about carbs if I was going to order an entire wagon of food? Who knows anymore. Anyway, the place is LOVELY and their menu is easily the most visually stunning I've seen in mah laaaaaf. Seriously. Great place, shall return upon becoming thin again.",

It's just that the portions are relatively small compared to some other Japanese places that I've been to that were priced the same. THAT BEING SAID, their food is really good and they have such a wide variety of things to choose from! I also love their popped rice dessert and the sesame chocolate truffle thing. I think it's ideal for group dinners cause then you can order a selection platter - which is probably more cost effective - and share all sorts without having to order a bunch of small portions.",

    "text": "Copenhagen's finest Japanese cuisine is now available in...Covent Garden? Come again? The Danes are known for many things: great design, Lego-blocks, and even the little mermaid....but sushi....isn't Copenhagen a bit far from Tokyo? The thought of going to a Danish Japanese restaurant in Central London shows how truly global we've become.Nevertheless the concept of this hip Nordic chain of Japanese fusion restaurants works rather well. This location (apparently the first London location was Wimbledon, yes, Wimbledon really) that oozes Scandi-cool---think clean lines, high ceilings, stark colours, lots of exposed wood, and unusually shaped communal tables. Once you navigate through the complicated menu (it's almost comical how complicated it is...way too many choices of set menus and individual items on offer, all slightly oddly named...it took a bit of explaining from the waitress on how it all worked), you're in for a treat as the food does impress. The main premise here is quality sushi combined with an assortment of grilled \"sticks\" which are skewers of meats and fish. I shared the \"upgrade\" set menu with a friend. For about \u00a360 you got an assortment of rolls, several delicious slices of salmon carpaccio, and skewers of shrimp, chicken and tuna. The salmon in particular with its fusion-y sauce was a highlight as were the rice paper wrapped duck rolls. The skewers were ok but not super memorable; I expected more from the chicken wing skewers. Surprisingly the side of broccoli was amazing, some of the best broccoli I've ever had. I definitely need to figure out how to make it at home. While \u00a360 sounds steep (\u00a330/person), it actually is a lot of food, no room for dessert!There is also a nice selection of fusion cocktails and Japanese whiskeys on offer though they're on the pricey side (Yamazaki 18, a great whisky to try for sure, but at \u00a335 a go is excessively steep).4 stars overall, worth the trip even if just to try their Danish take on Japanese cuisine.",

I wasn't disappointed though, and could quickly see why it was such a popular restaurant. There wasn't any space for us to sit at the main restaurant, so we went for the bar menu. To be honest, it was more than enough! We went for one of the sharing plates for two, which had an array of sushi rolls. A little on the pricey side, but there was plenty of food and we ended up having to take the left overs home as we couldn't finish it between the two of us. The staff were a little slow (I think it was a busy night), but very polite. Definitely a place to go if you want to treat yourself (or someone else).",

    "text": "I absolutely loved the place. I believe service and the setting are almost as important as food and it counts in my notation of a place as I find it hard to enjoy good food in a discouraging environment. Well, Stick n Sushi got that admirably. When coming in you can't fail to notice the interior design. Subdued light, wooden furniture in sometimes funny shapes, dark dark dark (I like dark). It's big on the ground floor and there is even more sitting downstairs. The wooden chairs are comfortableYou're welcomed at the entrance by a waitress/waiter. We had the chance to find a table for 4 within minutes but they recommend you make a reservation for they are packed even with so many tables available. It's a hot spot and it's in the heart of Covent Garden. Our waiter came to introduce himself. He was jovial, kind and very energetic, we had a good time with him. He even summoned all the remaining french he could find within him to chat with my parents. He was very thoughtful without over doing it. He helped and advised us on the huge menu.Speaking of the menu.You'll find anything and everything from roasted cauliflower, edamame (nicely roasted in a spicy sticky sauce and tasty) and broccoli to teriyaki (meat sticks), nigiri sushis, makis, meat and salads. We tried a bit of everything.I had the kimchi, the black cod dragon roll, the shake daikon and the panko breaded duck. I found the kimchi too salty and too full of flavour, but I had wanted to try it for a while. It's fermented vegetables so obviously, it would taste strong. The black cod dragon roll was my favourite and it's worth its \u00a312. Flavours are well put together and it's melting in your mouth. The shake daikon is an interesting concept. It's a maki roll but they replaced the rice and the seaweed with a sort of radish (the daikon). It tastes good without the rice taking the podium on the flavours and it's perfect for those on a low carb diet. Finally, the duck stick was a good surprise as I didn't know what to expect. I have eaten duck in many forms and this one was a novelty. The meat was very well cooked and melting in the mouth, the bread coat was crusty and didn't taste too oily and the wasabi sauce it's served with, perfect. I heard same praises from my family as they enjoyed their dishes. For the dessert, we had an assortment of chocolate fondant, cr\u00e8mes br\u00fbl\u00e9es, chocolates and the coconut cake which is the only thing none of us appreciated at all. My brother tried the Japanese soda, which is basically sprite in a Japanese bottle (which does make it funnier), and a french Chardonnay to our taste. Note that they offer a sufficient range of wines from different origins and for a wide pricing range (from \u00a320 to over \u00a350 a bottle).It was a no mistake for Sticks n Sushi. I would recommend it to anyone on the lookout for a very good yet not too expensive Japanese restaurant in London. I mean, it is pricey, but not as unreasonable as we expected. If that make any sense.",

The waitress checked in with me several times during my visit to ensure I hadn't changed my mind about beverage and updating me on remaining wait time. Ordered a couple of different Uramaki roles, incredibly delicious. Definitely the best sushi place in London!",

    "text": "Ever since my friend told me about this amazing sushi place I had to pay a visit! I finally managed to get some time and off I ventured out for lunch. Been scoping the menu online so I knew what to expect when I got there and could just order my food. The interior is beautiful, high ceilings, they have two entrances making life a lot easier, beaming with light, nice black tables with comfy seating, and eyes staring at you from the walls. The menu once presented immaculate, the waiters and waitresses are a joy, they give you the best advice and what to choose. The food is presented really well too. Nothing is amissed. The spicy edamame is the best I have had!! It's so modish, juicy packed with an abundance of flavour. For drink I opted for the rhubarb fizz as it was only 12 noon when I had arrives. For sushi I think I played it a bit safe, I didn't want to overeat and have food left, I don't like leftovers. So I opted for the hand rolls, veggie and crunchy. I'm not usually a fan because of the seaweed but wow these ones are beautiful, the seaweed is not even noticed, packed with loads of flavour and sauce inside till the end. Matched with the Wasabi, soya and pickled ginger I could eat that all day. Only little hitch is that it does make your mouth dry, the seaweed I mean once it gets caught on your lips. But that is so minor!!Then I opted for sticks, a variety of mixed yasai yakitori, chicken wing, tsukune and grilled oyster mushroom. I loved them all apart from the wing, even though the skin was nice and crispy, the whole thing lacked flavour. It was just a wing, nothing special which was a let down. However the tsukune (chicken meatball) was delicious, cooked to perfection and could taste all the spices and less of the chicken which is what you want. The vegetables accompanied the meat very well and the sauces of yakitori and teriyaki was perfect and the extra lemon slice goes a long way. Service was very attentive, always making sure I was ok and the food was up to scratch. I wish I had stayed for dessert but will definitely go back again and be more adventurous and perhaps take a date so can share a lot of dishes. Price is not too bad either, it's a beautiful place. Highly recommend it. Make sure you book in advance though, I was lucky to get a table during lunchtime, they were pretty packed! Even for a Thursday!!",

    "text": "Sticks and Sushi was highly recommended to me by my friend I was staying with in London this weekend. I live in San Diego CA and my friends from home told me I should check out Sushi Samba but he said that was very touristy, hard to get a reservation and the food at S&S was much better. \u00a0Now I eat a lot of sushi and sashimi and I am beyond impressed with the food I had at S&S.First of all we had a very nice server by the name of Sebastian who was from Denmark, my friend let him know it was my Birthday and he wished me a happy birthday. \u00a0He walked us through both menus, took our drink orders and gave us some time to look through the menu. \u00a0I could have ordered everything, it all sounded delicious and their menus are mini booklets with a photograph of each option next to the bite and description. \u00a0I've never seen a menu like that before, it's a great idea as it makes everything look and sound more appetizing. \u00a0We picked out several things we wanted and out of that Sebastian gave us his recommendations and I'm glad we listened.We started with edamame, you can never go wrong with that, we had the plain but they offer a spicy option. \u00a0Next we had the tuna tartare which was my favorite bite out of everything we had on this day, it had pine nuts, avocado, was full of flavor and truly was to die for. \u00a0Next we went for rolls, I chose the salmon rice paper roll which was a very neat concept and something I've never had before. \u00a0It was more of a wrap, it had lettuce, carrots, cucumber and shrimp tempura (light on the batter side) all wrapped up in rice paper and then sliced into 6 pieces. \u00a0I personally avoid to many rolls with rice so this was a perfect option for me. \u00a0We also had the gipsy big roll which was very good then we had one of the small tuna chilli rolls.I wanted more and if I come back I really would like to try their mini sides of vegtables. \u00a0From looking at the pictures the oyster mushrooms looked good along with the cauliflower, broccoli and mini corn on the cobs.We didn't have cocktails as we had a busy day ahead but they have a variety of cocktails, beers and non-alcoholic beverages. I highly recommend Sticks and sushi for their service, atmosphere, food and my favorite part...looking through their cool menu booklet with the pictures!",

    "text": "For me it's one of the best sushi chains in London and it didn't even open up its first restaurant in London but Denmark. Even during the busy Christmas season for our annual Christmas lunch, high quality of food and service delivers. We started with some soy cured salmon with minced shiitake mushrooms. The salmon was beautiful and rich in flavour. The texture was smooth and the minced mushroom was a lovely companion adding more depth and silkiness. An excellent start. Next was the Japanese potato salad, a lovely simple potato mash contrasted nicely with the crunchy vegetables of carrots, cucumber and onions. Tasty light and healthy.The salmon and avocado maki were perfect. The rice cooked well and held perfectly when you held it. The flavour of the silky rich salmon shone straight through the roll. Quality right there.The only dish that didn't tickle my tastebuds was the green salad. It was too dry for my liking, too crunchy with the softer quinoa being lost in there. More softer leaves would have been preferred for a more equal texture so the avocado could be enjoyed and played its role.Amongst us all we also ordered a \u00a0sharing platter from the set menu. We chose the Upgrade platter that came with a variety of rolls and meat on sticks. Beautiful glistening sushi, all so incredibly fresh and the rolls were paired so well with the ingredients it came with too, all perfectly balanced in texture and flavour. So much creativity. The sticks consisted of fresh tender flakey pieces of tuna, flavoursome, herby chicken meatballs and succulent juicy lamb chops. All delightful.Last to arrive in the savouries were the scallops in a light kataifi pastry. The texture was amazing. A light crispy pastry incasing a fresh and bouncy scallop with burst of saltiness from the trout roe for that little extra bit of joy!Dessert could have been the steal of the show itself. All presented beautifully and made with such creative flavours, fusing Japanese and Western flavours together. We had the coconut cake, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, dark chocolate fondant, dark chocolate and sesame balls and vanilla icecream. All delicious and was the perfect ending to dinner.I cannot recommend Sticks n Sushi enough. The atmosphere is fantastic, romantic and sleek as well as being child friendly. Bar seating downstairs for those who want to watch the chefs at work or large group tables for families and celebration. They have everyone covered. Of course the food is fantastic, of the highest quality and staff are trained to be knowledgable and as friendly as could be.",

The waitstaff was helpful and the menu itself somehow achieved that rare balance between being visually appealing and informative. It's anomalous to say the least. The wait for the sashimi combo was more than 45 minutes but since I was able to drown my sorrows in champagne it didn't matter too much. The only reason I had to knock a star off was that we were told it would be right out something like 15 minutes in, but ended up still having a lengthy wait. Aside from that minor incident, presentation, freshness, and level of service were all exemplary. From apps to drinks to sushi to sashimi to dessert and whatever else came our way, I was impressed. I wish we had tried the sticks.",

They brought out the cold (sushi) part first, which involved a couple rolls and the four common nigiri you'd expect: salmon, tuna, shrimp, and sea bass (I think sea bass is common - the others definitely are!). Anyway, everything was fresh and tasty. Next came the skewers, and I have to admit, although I was more excited for the sushi, the skewers were really good! Chicken teriyaki, pork belly, and chicken meatballs were all excellent, and it was all the right amount of food in the end. I was full, but not overly stuffed. The food came quickly, but it took a little while to actually order - it was incredibly busy, and we didn't have a reservation, so I wasn't too disappointed by that, and the food and drinks more than made up for it. I'd go back, which is the main thing I look for in a restaurant!",

    "text": "The restaurant is beautifully designed and the shape and use of the shared tables are brilliant. \u00a0You are certainly impressed when walking in, and equally so (if a bit overwhelmed) by the massive but beautifully photographed menu. \u00a0So my disdain for the crass name of the restaurant quickly disappeared... yes for that 1 second I was being a complete restaurant snob. Anyway as I reminded myself that I am sometimes partial to a McDonald's cheeseburger we proceeded on our way through a few snacks and a few platters. \u00a0The sushi was not bad nor was the teriyaki. \u00a0However the more and more I continued through the meal there was this absolute feeling that we were being fed \"Japanese\" inspired food by people who didn't really get Japanese food. \u00a0The constant yelling of Irasshaimase in a very un-Japanese restaurant grated on me even more as I put another mouthful of soulless food in my mouth. I get that it's Japanese with a Danish touch, and the food isn't bad - neither the sushi nor the teriyaki were bad, a notch above Yo Sushi or Wasabi. \u00a0But I'm not going to be conned by the great decor here. \u00a0Fish quality was distinctly average and seasoning was all over the place, often meat would not be seasoned enough and batter would be over-seasoned. \u00a0But it's ok the distinctly average fish and seafood would be smothered in a spicy mayo so any semblance of natural sweet ocean freshness was gone, scallops tasted like shrimp etc. etc. Perhaps the most underrated part of sushi is the rice. \u00a0I'm sorry but if the rice is not fluffy and bouncy or even seasoned correctly then you shouldn't be charging these prices. And this is my biggest grief with Sticks and Sushi. \u00a0I feel like I've been conned with the beautiful decor and menu. \u00a0The food is a notch above your average London high street sushi place (and the quality of sushi in London is not great in general), yes a single notch. \u00a0We paid \u00a3120 for 2 at lunch (with 2 beers and 2 cocktails) for very average soulless food. \u00a0Staggering! \u00a0It saddens me to think that restaurants like this who focus on image and looks more than the food itself can become popular. \u00a0And don't get me started on that melted cheese wrapped with ham on a stick.",

But I was extremely disappointed by the arrogant attitude of the waiting team, the tricks playing around the waiting system, and the way they manage customer makes me felling like idiot. It is one of those tricky restaurant that I am feeling being fooled. We walked in, didn't book. The host by door told us will take us to the bar and having few drinks till the table is available. I certainly respect that and have no problem to wait. As soon as we were led to the bar, the waiter told us will be dinning at bar. To be honest I have no problem to eat on bar, but I hate the way they lie, this waiter was right standing at the door with the host. I wish to point out that there were plenty seats at that time, and I respect that reservation goes first so that I nicely asked if we could wait in case there are free tables. Anyway that never happened. We felt exhausted and hated the service.",

    "text": "Brilliant, efficient and enthusiastic service. Why couldn't everything meet the same standard? I love that one of our waiters took the time to explain to us which fish are currently sustainable, the ethical element really added to the experience. Sadly there were some issues, and for the price, I'd expect a little better. Firstly, our drinks: the glasses were all wet, and had been garnished with an old lime peel. It really should have been freshly cut. The menus were also dirty, which is a shame because they're so nicely designed! It's just poor attention to detail.The positioning of the tables isn't good. There is not a clear route through the ground level of the restaurant, which lead other customers to squeeze between tables. We really had to keep an eye on our water glasses, in case of rouge butts and elbows! So as for the main event : the food, they have a huge selection, so it felt a bit like ordering from a canteen. The dishes we tried included the scallops, Jerusalem artichoke, sashimi selection and avocado nigiri. The artichoke and crab balls were a bit too salty and the nigiri did not hold together well. The quality of the fish overall, was not great.Sushi in London is often disappointing, and I think that this place falls in to that category. But I will say that it is \u00a0better than many others.",

We were given oshiboris to freshen up our hands moments after we arrived. \u00a0The menu features detailed pictures of every dish, so it is very easily understandable, even for non-English speakers. The yakitoris were perfectly cooked, the sushis, nigiris and makis were succulent and the fish dishes were so fresh that we even found a scale chip on a slice of salmon.

If you're looking for the normal subtleties of Japanese cuisine, you're barking up the wrong Scandinavian tree. But don't let that deter you. Sushi N Sticks is loud on cool wood design and big flavours. A copious meal for two with drinks came to \u00a399. The menu is a beautifully photographed but slightly ridiculous (and overwhelming long) menu of sushi, yakitori and other bits and bobs of Japanese food items. There is a shorter book of preset menus to help those who can't muster the energy to work through the main menu. We had:Grilled and green salad: \u00a0there must be something ridiculous like 20 ingredients in the salad. It's pretty to look at and topped with a bold salad dressing. I enjoyed this but my eating partner found it too strong. Spare ribs: \u00a0delicious! Fall off the bone meat coated in a super tasty sauceAn assortment of sushi rolls: \u00a0 \u00a0- crab coal sushi roll was with black coal rice which was a cool contrast to the normal white. I didn't really like this as much as my friend. I thought there were too many things trying to happen at the same time.- Hells Kitchen Roll: \u00a0I was slightly apprehensive about the BBQ sauce but I liked this roll. Pretty to look at, tasty to eat- crispy ebi roll: \u00a0this was my favourite. I thought the shrimp and the crunch came through really well to contrast with the riceWe also had two smaller rolls which were good but not necessarily outstanding (ebi and chilli and salmon and scallion). Our waiter was awesome. He was a bearded Asian guy with a fab smile and friendly demeanour. Why can't all service in London be like this?",

    "text": "This place was delicious! It's pricey so I don't know if I'd be able to come here again unless it was a special occasion, but I was visiting London for a few days and I decided that I wanted to try some good Japanese food. First about the ambience: it's a very modern, sleek, and clean design. I think that if you're a fan of minimalistic design and you like the dim lights, it's perfect for you (I tend to like that kind of design as well). Oh, also, they have beautiful pictures displaying their menu items so it really gets you excited for the food.My friend and I wound up getting three dishes: the rice paper (it's a unique roll with duck), the salmon sashimi, and a dish called man food. My friend got the rice paper and couldn't stop raving about it. It didn't fill her up, but she had already eaten and said that the flavors were delicious. The salmon sashimi was actually my first time eating sashimi and it was pretty good, though I have no reference points so I can't say much about this. My main dish was the man food dish which provided me with a ton of different meat on sticks (duck, beef, chicken) as well as some ribs. All of this meat was fantastic and even though it cost quite a bit, it was delicious and filled my craving for meat. It also came with edamame and rice which was a nice touch (I love edamame). Overall, this place was wonderful and it gets a solid 4 stars and would be 5 if their prices weren't so freaking high.",

Service was great and the food was good. We got a sampling of pretty much everything and I liked it all except the fried bacon wrapped cheese - this was just a bit.... gross to me. But thankfully there were many more \"fresher\" options for me to choose from. Although the sushi was not the best I have ever had, it was good and the roll combos are creative and fun. A good place for a fun night out and a great place for groups as there is truly something of everyone.",

Servers are friendly and very helpful. My fiend and I ordered a large plate that we shared. A little pricy but very worth it. The shared plate of a variety of sushi was plenty for both of us. Served on a layer of ice, you could smell the freshness. The sushi tasted extremely fresh and we could tell that it was just made, maybe even just caught from the water! The fish was extremely fresh and did not taste too fishy or old. I'm not a big raw fish eater, but this restaurant was a great place for lunch. If you want some great sushi, go here.",

I went for 3 sushi rolls (16 pieces!), including Rainbow Roll, Crispy Ebi Roll and just a normal salmon and cucumber roll. Also had some cooked duck breast with Apple sauce. Of course I had some sticks too, pork belly and sweet potato. The food was tasty, but not that authentic Japanese food (nothing compared to the food I ate in Japan). The restaurant was very busy and very loud! The waiter I had was lovely! I probably won't be going back unless my dining partners want to... However I would recommend everyone to go visit this restaurant at least once! Overall, I give this restaurant a 7/10. Paid \u00a375 for 2 people. More reviews on my instagram: mattzard",

Not a big deal- but was surprise that two guys could not get squeezed in, it blessing in disguise- the one out door table was not bad. (for the record when we left - restaurant was still half empty. We also got the rookie server) The food was okay- it didn't do justice to their pictorial menu. (If you're going to glamor shot your menu and present it to guest- I suggest you make sure the kitchen executes) - that menu is one if the best I have seen- so might be a little unfair to kitchen to set that expectation. We ordered the Gala menu and a chirashi bowl- I enjoyed the bowls. Sushi was so-so and \"sticks\" were only okay. IOverall - it's a good spot for showy first dates and client dinners. But the service we received felt perfunctory and I think we got dismissed as riff raff by the staff.",

In all honesty, I wish I got a bowl myself you'll definitely get your money's worth. Customer service was great and we were seated right away on a Friday evening.London itself is expensive!

We came during the week and it was mayhem. So just know this before planning - we snuck some bar seats after a while.On to the food - the menu is huge! We grabbed a variety of stuff.Grilled avocado - delicious starterSeaweed salad - overpriced, I'd skip it.Spicy edamame - awesome, done perfectlySpicy miso soup - with salmon and shiitake! Wow!We then ordered the \"perfect day\" menu combo for two, and it was amazing! Also, they put all sauces on the side since I hate mayonnaise. Here are the highlights -Crab croquettes were crazy good. Super crispy and not too gooey.Spicy tuna maki - perfect amount of spicy, and not too much rice.Seared salmon tataki was good, not that memorableAll nigiri was fresh and delicious (tuna especially)The yakitori was good, not amazing. The chicken meatballs were by far the best.An awesome spot! Very good service and lots to choose from.",

    "text": "This was my first visit to Sticks'n'Sushi and it certainly won't be my last. Upon arriving at Sticks n Sushi, the first impression is of a modern environment. All of the streamlined furniture amidst the rustic backdrop of brick walls and wooden floors give the entire restaurant a homey feeling. Not only that, but I was greeted by a friendly staff that was happy to show me to my seat and advise menu items based on my preferences. They were always prompt with their service and everyone was very personable.When I first looked at the menu, I saw several options that I wanted to try. With the staff's recommendation, I started off with ebi bites. The ebi bites were brilliantly mouth watering. Featuring shrimp with several spices to bring out their flavor, the ebi bites were a an excellent start an excellent meal. My friends and I chose the Four Meal Drive Big (6 types of nigiri and 6 of maki) \u00a0to share, we began with the nigiri selection. I sampled each of the 6 nigiri - the salmon and seared seabass being my favourites. Among the maki selection preferred the spicy tuna and salmon ceviche. On to the dessert we couldn't help but choose the taster, which consisted of 12 different kinds of sweet delights! The mochi ice cream, yuzu sorbet and creme brulee were definitely the standouts for me. The entire night was full of great service, excellent food and certainly left a wonderful impression. A must-visit for anyone in the area who loves sushi.",

I felt sorry that she (and everyone else) seemed to have to shout something unintelligible in Danish to signal our arrival - this seemed to be a little artificial and unnecessary. Perhaps I missed the cultural context. Anyway, I digress.The sashimi was marvellous, and not too pricey - I could have ordered double the amount. However, I felt that the rest of the food was a little hit and miss - the hits were absolutely brilliant - like the Ebi Panko maki roll, the spare ribs, and the oddly named 'Hell's Kitchen' roll. On the other hand, the salmon ceviche roll tasted a bit like fairy liquid, and the teriyaki sauce on the marinated salmon was a tad sickly.The atmosphere, layout etc are all very good, and, strange as it sounds, their soy sauce was really delicious! Overall, I would recommend trying this place, and would probably come back again; though perhaps next time I'll be better off asking the delightful waitress for recommendations, instead of her phone number...",

My friends and I are still talking about it, and my somewhat uppity friend even said this was top 5 restaurants he's been to. That's a rave review.We shared the big sushi platter. It was perfect between six. The bacon wrapped scallops made me want to cry; they were so good. The salmon sashimi (and the rest!) was extremely fresh. I loved everything I ate. Perfect for sharing.Overall, an excellent place that I'll be back to. It's a beautiful atmosphere with awesome staff and delicious food. Don't need anything else!",

Pretty solid food and service.Rather large dining area with a ground floor and lower ground for seating that is dimly lit and pretty good for an intimate dinner. Several friends and I came here for a weekday dinner. The name of the restaurant is aptly named as they serve sushi and yakitori. So we grabbed one of the platters for the table which included various maki sushi and skewered meats (mainly chicken). Quality of the sushi was rather good. The yakitori was well made as well. These platters are huge, so be warned and bring enough people. No way could 3 of us finish a single platter alone.Drinks are so-so when it comes to the cocktails, so stick with standbys of sake and beer. Don't get their take on an old fashion.. overly sweet and comes with chocolate chips... a bit weird for me.",

First impressions were good - a comprehensive menu with a balance of traditional and fusion in addition to great decor and welcoming staff.I sat at a high table in the bar area and after sitting for ten minutes figured it was traditional London, requiring me to order at the bar. I ordered a drink and a few minutes later a waitress arrived to take my drink order; turns out there was just a 15 minute wait from first sitting down and seeing a waitress.By that time I had ordered food. I wasn't very hungry so ordered a light meal and the waitress seemed insulted that I was not ordering something more substantial-- I got two small sushi rolls and some nigiri.The food took about 45 minutes to arrive, after needing to ask about the status of the meal from another server. When the food came my server was lightly apologetic.The food was not good. It was bland, the fish was low quality, and the sushi rice was poorly made. The serving sizes matched the pictures on the menu, however, so I was not surprised by the size.After finishing and waiting several minutes to ask for the cheque, I gave up and paid at the bar.All in all for a light snack, I was at the restaurant for about 90 minutes.I will not return to Sticks N Sushi. The food was not good, the service was remarkably bad and the prices were not at all good value. There are many other nearby London sushi restaurants which beat Sticks N Sushi in all of the price, quality, and service categories.",

Everything was nice apart from the FOOD. Sushi rice was so dry and dense as if they have to really push it together for the rice grains to stick. I asked for recommendation and turned out that the dish recommended was the worst. We had 'Coal Crab' the coal black rice inside was especially bad. The price is relatively expensive for what you get. It was not worth it. I guess if you are not asian then it would have been an amazing experience.",

From the outside, it looked shut as it was dark and there was no sign of life. However, after trying the door we walked into an open spacious room with the sunlight streaming through the glass roof as we were welcomed by a member of staff and shown to our table. We made no reservation as it was a weekday and relatively quiet.We had a lovely waiter who talked us through the menu and offered suggestions. The menu itself is quite impressive with images of each dish. With many, many options it took us a while to decide. We even ordered seconds. The best sushi I have ever had and the most fresh.As addicted as I am to sushi, the highlight was the fresh green juice! Not being much of a juice drinker I decided to give it a go and I am so glad I did. I've already made plans to visit again..can't wait.",
