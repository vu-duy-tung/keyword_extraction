But before rushing headlong into dessert (tempting though that is...) I guess I should show a modicum of decorum and talk about the rest. I hesitated about booking given some mixed reviews - but a friend who bakes for a living and therefore should know her stuff, highly recommended it. It was even better than I anticipated. Warm, cosy, welcoming on a wet and windy night, the service was really friendly given what a busy Saturday night it was. I had the pumpkin pearl barley risotto, which was absolutely delicious - I can safely say I polished off the lot. After a crisis of indecision over the menu - too many choices, which all sounded great - my \u00a0friend really enjoyed his charter pie with a side of heritage carrots. There were no quibbles over dessert, though - we both went for the sticky toffee pud - his with the advertised ice cream, mine with extra toffee sauce instead. Now I've eaten a lot of sticky toffee puds. I've even judged them in the Great Taste Awards. So I really know my puddings. And this was, quite simply, the best ever. Incredibly moist, dense without being heavy - the sauce had just the right hint of treacle to stop it being too sickly sweet. Oh, who am I kidding? It was just lush. I've already booked to go back again next month.",

I used Yelp to find this place that just happened to be a short walk from our Hotel. We braved the biting London cold and headed out to find some grub. I liked the look of the place as soon as we walked through the door. Lots of rustic wood layers everywhere and old English country nick nacks add to the warm and inviting cozy feeling that greets you, there is a small bar at the front and the eating area is at the rear with an open kitchen. Super friendly young staff took our orders of pear, blue cheese and endive salad with creamed artichoke soup and a Charter pie (chicken, mushroom, bacon, white wine and cream with a huge flaky crust top) with a side of butter mashed potatoes all to be washed down with an ice cold creamy Guinness for me and a glass of champagne for the missus. The food hit the spot, only the finest fresh British organic ingredients are used and it shows in the simple but delicious dishes Bumpkin serves. My jet lag was replaced by a warm sleepy coma, ZZzzzzz, perfect. Until we stepped outside to be rudely slapped wide awake by the relentless cold, hello London! I've missed you.",

My friend had the cow pie, and seemed rather happy with it. \u00a0I suppose I should have followed his advice, that being which they are best \"known for\".Anyhow, with cheeses at \u00a310 a board of three, and \"artisanal\" bread and butter for \u00a33, along with other over-priced feed, we decided to call it a day at the main course and a couple of rounds of alcohol.No doubt the puddings are wonderful, and I was every so tempted to order up a sticky toffee pudding - the worlds fave dessert, but in the end I just wanted to retreat back to the better side of town and delve into my own well-stocked drinks cabinet and fridge.",

    "text": "The idea of a Sunday roast awakens a tumescence of excitement in me. Good food is inherently sexual, and I had high expectations that Bumpkin would treat me well.As their slogan depicts it is indeed a country retreat in the city. The decor is warming and decidedly country. The service was nothing short of excellent in a reserved non-obtrusive country manner. (Are you seeing the trend here?) Even the waitresses were far removed from the glammed up princesses London restaurants tend to offer. Bumpkin tries for authenticity and I believe they succeed.A shortish menu in this calibre of establishment should mean excellence of execution and mastery of flavour and presentation in their dishes. At our table of four two had fish dishes whilst a colleague and I both had the Roast Beef. All our plates were clean by the end yet a lack of contentment was clearly palpable. I simply expected more for the price. I believe one should be full after a roast dinner, and I was not. Even my colleague who rarely cleans her plate polished off the roast and still felt hungry afterwards. The Yorkshire puddings were very dry and flaky and the most disappointing aspect of the food. We were disheartened enough to go elsewhere for desert.I am in no way saying that Bumpkin's food is bad, it isn't. Yet for \u00a318.50 a head, I believe I am in my right to expect more. On my Sunday visit Bumpkin was full of Sloanies' and West London's finest. I am sure this reassuringly expensive eatery will continue to thrive in such a cash rich area.",

The menu is simple, serving English food, very well presented. My black pudding and pear salad to start was excellent, my girlfriends beetroot cured salmon equally so. For main course I opted for 'over night roasted belly of pork', which was as good as it sounds and my girlfriend had 'Charters Pie', a chicken, bacon and mushroom affair which was enormous. Crumble and ice cream (made fresh daily), then finished the supper perfectly. We had a quick look at the private dining room upstairs which again had been designed very well - comfortably the best of the various Chelsea pubs. All in all a cracking evening, a great atmosphere within which to spend some time, thoroughly recommended.",

    "text": "I tried Bumpkin for the first time based on the fact that they were listed in the Good Food Guide 2009 - I went back for the second time because I happily learned that they were on that list for good reason.Please don't be put off by the fact that they are situated right next to a bright neon Shell station. That is a bit lame, but once inside you forget completely about the light pollution outside. I think my favorite part about Bumpkin is the decor - they've done a really great job of keeping with that \"country farm\" theme. Gourds and veggies are proudly displayed around the restaurant (wooden chairs and tables of course) which is refreshing in this part of town.The menu is short and sweet - and that is perfectly fine. The service is slow because of how crowded the restaurant seems to be lately, but other than that, I have no complaints. The food is wonderful - if I could, I would have devoured the mac & cheese. It looked amazing.I feel like this is the best type of place to take out-of-town guests / parents / family members visiting London. It's nice without being too fancy, in a part of town where visitors are most likely staying (Gloucester Road = a million hotels), and serves up great British food.A nice simple winner.",

My recommendation is if you are looking to dine on English standards but avoid a pub scene, visit Bumpkin!",

Bumpkin is yet another \"eat local, eat fresh\" British concept restaurant. But whereas Canteen can feel like eating in a Scandinavian cafeteria (don't get me wrong, I still love it), Bumpkin is like hunkering down in a country cottage - cozy and warm. We had the specials off the blackboard, including the pan seared plaice with purple broccoli - delicious! The fish was cooked perfectly and the vegetables (often overlooked) were good enough that they could have been a meal all on their own. \u00a0For dessert we ordered the warm fruit crumble which came with ice cream - the perfect end to a very good meal.",

The tricky part I've found is that in London, I expect everything to be good, or it just doesn't get those last few stars.I like the atmosphere... my first thought was that it was a pub, from the dark decorations and wood panelling. But, it's definitely a restaurant, because A) there's no \u00a0bar, and B) it's all full of tables with a nicely exposed kitchen.I didn't like being seated next to the kitchen, and next to a pole. It made the whole thing feel cramped, and on an early date, these kinds of things can feel really awkward, when it's already an awkward situation.The cocktails were nice, though not super strong. The food was alright, though nothing particularly fancy. I had a burger and my date had the chicken. They both looked wholesome and heavy, though not super healthy. They were already, certainly flavorful but nothing that stood out. I know lots of really great burger places that this wouldn't stand up to.Service was pretty good, which was a redeeming thing, since nothing bad stands out in my mind.Overall though, it was a bit of a mixed back experience. I'm not sure, not living in the area, I would ever trek back that far again.",

We're from out of the UK so we wanted to try something English but not spend an arm and a leg. This very adorable restaurant is nestled in South Kensington and from the outside you would assume it was an ordinary little food place. \u00a0The great thing is that it's far from that! Warm, good lighting and lots of guests eating away!The waiter we had was super friendly and helpful. He took our order and it came quite quickly. They even has a \"menu of the day\" written on the chalk board in the back of the restaurant (kind of where we sat). I ordered a side of green leaf salad and the Charter Pie. The charter pie consists of the \"traditional short crust pastry; free range chicken, leeks, mushrooms, bacon in a creamy tarragon sauce\". \u00a0The crust was soft and still very warm when it arrived in front of me. \u00a0It was a small portion but just perfection at every bite. \u00a0No complaints! My boyfriend ordered the Shepherd's Pie \"mutton and lamb with root vegetable in a red wine gravy baked under Duchess potatoes\". \u00a0I had one taste of my charter pie and it was absolutely delicious. Although the restaurant was a bit crowded (that probably speaks to the popularity and quality of the food), I really enjoyed the atmosphere and meal. The staff were all very pleasant and it was a good experience to have considering it was my first UK meal. I cannot wait to go back and definitely would recommend this place for out of towners and any Londoners hungry for great quality food.",

    "text": "Okay. \u00a0The food is beautiful and quite delicious so if we are reviewing on food alone...this place is really great. \u00a0My only concern today was that I met a friend for lunch and waited at least an hour for my starter \"Onion Tart with stuffed tomato\". \u00a0I think, to be fair, that the server was waiting for my lunch date to finish her soup but he should have asked. \u00a0While she ate, \u00a0I sat their just waiting. \u00a0It was slightly annoying. \u00a0The staff was friendly and the food was quite good. \u00a0My tart, \u00a0once it finally arrived, \u00a0was beautiful (see pictures as I have added one of the dish) and tasted delightful. \u00a0One random note. \u00a0I loved the decor. \u00a0It was like a rustic dining room with open views of the kitchen staff as they prepared meals. \u00a0I particularly liked the bright green tiles in the kitchen and the array of mirrors on the walls. \u00a0Ladies, \u00a0check out the wall paper in the bathrooms...super cute. \u00a0They looked like what I imagine would happen if a diamond and a snowflake had a baby...To see a photo, \u00a0check out my food blog \"The Southern Stump\". \u00a0You can see a link on my profile.",

The food was great, I personally love the farm to table concept and the freshness of the beet and goat cheese appetizer was really awesome. \u00a0I had the risotto, which was packed with flavor though it was a little dry, my partner had the fish pie, which was very very good and well worth it. \u00a0For dessert we had the toffee pudding with the salted caramel ice cream with some tea both were amazing! We will definitely be returning at some point if not later this trip and I would recommend this place to anyone!",

After enjoying a lovely lunch we ordered the sticky toffee pudding to split. As our server entered the order someone from the kitchen must have said something, because from the computer where she entered our order, right in front of us, she turned around and said \" I don't know, I put my hands up.\" \u00a0The person in the kitchen ( who was out of my view) must have said or did something else because she continued on to say \"the menu says it's award winning.\" I immediately wanted to cancel the order and leave. I don't know if I have ever felt so bad about ordering a dish on a menu in my life. I like to run my mouth but I hope I have enough sense to do it out of the hearing of the people I'm talking about, let slone paying customers, and it wasn't like all we ordered were side salads and water.It sorta stinks that someone's thoughtless behavior ruined an otherwise great meal.",

    "text": "When my friends and I wanted to find a brunch spot before visiting the V&A, we found it surprisingly hard to think of a good place around South Kensington. Bumpkin came up a number of times during our online research, and it seemed to have good reviews so we went ahead and booked a table. Unfortunately, we didn't realize that brunch is only served until noon on Sunday, so when we arrived, we only had a lunch and Sunday roast menu to choose from.Luckily, most of us were in the mood for roast, so we ordered the chicken and two orders of sirloin. One friend also ordered the sea bass. I tried both of the roasts and thought the chicken was much better than the sirloin, which we ordered medium rare, but came out as a thin, tough piece of meat. The roast was also served with roast potatoes, a Yorkshire pudding, and roast vegetables that seemed to be doused in a creamy cheese sauce. I've had better roast vegetables, but we all agreed that the potatoes and Yorkshire puddings hit the spot.By the time we left the restaurant around 2 PM, the whole place was packed and it is definitely a popular neighborhood spot. I enjoyed the dining experience, but it was not the best roast that I've ever had. I think it is a good option if you are in the area, but I look forward to exploring other places in South Kensington. If anyone has better recommendations, please send them my way!",

It has the ambiance of a small family restaurant and the service to match.The menu is just right-seasonal dishes with a hint of tradition, excellent specials and a nice drinks selection.Our first meal (we liked it so much we did go back) is a slight blur due to *a bit* of jet lag, although I do remember the fish and chips being spot on and I loved the mushy peas. One of our party had the chicken which was perfectly done, and one of the specials we had, a chicken and mushroom pie, was stellar.If you are a fan of stouts, the Whistable Bay Oyster Stout is amazing-a must try.After our second visit, my DH and son stayed for drinks at the bar, where they enjoyed more excellent service and a nice selection of ales.The next time we are in Kensington, we'll definitely be back.",

The moment we walked in we were ignored by the hostess, a horrible woman with short hair and a contemptible and undeserving sense of pompousness. She told us without looking up for a second in a very cold manner that the garden was fully booked and we needed a reservation, however there was absolutely no one inside, which should have been my first clue that this was not the best place to eat. The garden was occupied by only two small groups of \u00a0diners and none of the tables had reserved signs, this should have been the second indication to leave but we stayed and put in our order.The only decent part about our experience was the quality of the food and the accommodating waitresses but we could not fully enjoy it because the plates the food was brought out on were dirty all throughout. They were not washed properly and had bits of food and streak marks.The cherry on top was when an older couple walked in and the same woman who seated us walked up to them in a very cheery and polite attitude and seated them out in the garden without a reservation. We inquired about this situation with one of the managers and were given a bullshit explanation about the timing and not wanting to inconvenience us with moving us if other reserved diners showed up.I will be turning people away from eating here any chance I get. Absolutely horrible.",

The macaroni and cheese was delcious and the mushrooms on top were the best mushrooms i have ever had. I will seriously fly to London just so I can eat here!

    "text": "For lunch I decided on Bumpkin. \u00a0Where they served traditional English fare. \u00a0The prices are decent and you feel at home from the moment you walk in. \u00a0Looking around everything is done with an eye towards being upscale while still being comfortable and simple. \u00a0The warm wooden interior and mixed match chairs gives the place sort of a farmhouse feeling which definitely coincides with the menu that focuses on locality as well as seasonality. \u00a0I sat down next to a window that was dotted with several different plants in glass vases of varying sizes that looked to be a hodgepodge of items purchased at a yard sale. \u00a0The table was set with a bright yellow flower that used an old soda bottle as a vase. \u00a0You couldn't make this venue more comfortable if you tried. \u00a0To drink I had a Guinness. \u00a0I swear, Guinness is better outside of America. \u00a0It actually tastes like a pretty legit stout. \u00a0I decided to go with the pork croquettes to start. \u00a0 This dish was amazing. \u00a0You get the tenderness from the roasted pork that is then finely shredded and formed into a perfectly shaped cylinder before being breaded and fried. \u00a0The presentation was incredible. \u00a0You had this wonderful brightness provided by pickled onions as well as this sweet apple and raisin sauce. \u00a0All on top of a little cucumber salad. \u00a0It was a great appetizer because even though the roast pork is heavy, it was portioned well and combined with the rest of the ingredients it gave a bit of lightness to the dish that made you want to come back for more.For the main course I had the Fish and Chips, with tartar sauce and mushy peas. \u00a0Many people are down on fish and chips and British food in general and I totally don't understand why. \u00a0This fish and chip was great. \u00a0 The batter was crisp and the fish was moist and perfectly cooked. \u00a0The fries had the perfect texture, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. \u00a0I loved it for it's simplicity. \u00a0It was also my first time tasting mushy peas. \u00a0I had never been big on peas as a child. It was kind of a point of contention between me and my mother since they are her favorite vegetable. \u00a0I despised sweet peas. \u00a0As an adult I kind of came around to like peas quite a bit. \u00a0These peas were perfect not too sweet and I love the mint that complimented the peas as well.For dessert there was the sticky toffee pudding. \u00a0I am not a fan of overly sweet desserts, except when some form of caramel is involved and then all bets are off. \u00a0The sticky toffee pudding was bursting forth with this rich sweet flavor. \u00a0This is one of those instances where the English language is a barrier, because it wasn't a pudding like what you would think of from an American perspective. \u00a0It was more like a cake soaked with a sweet caramel sauce. \u00a0I was nearly stuffed but ended up powering through the entire dish.",

    "text": "Very poor service, all of the workers are friends and hang out with each other instead of helping customers. It's more of a social gathering for them rather than a restaurant. Had to go pick up the menu from the waitresses ourselves, never got the 'specials' menu, and lastly had to go up to the waitress to ask for the check after waiting 15 minutes. Menu is extremely vague with what items are in each dish, and this did not help with my spouse's allergies. But when our waitress was around, she was helpful with helping us with that.Food and drinks, although, were very good. Looks like the cooks have their act together while on the contrary, the actual running of the restaurant does not.",

    "text": "We found this place because we were looking for sticky toffee in London and this was in the top 10 in an article online. Well, we had to agree because it was the best sticky toffee we had in the UK. We spent two weeks traveling in Scotland and England and this was our favorite! As for other food, we shared the spare ribs, which were fantastic and a perfect starter for two. Then we got steak and ale pie and sizzling chicken and steak. (pictured below) The steak and ale pie was the perfect amount of pastry and it had well flavored meat. The chicken and steak platter was a great portion! Honestly, we were looking at all the meals coming from the kitchen and everything looked good. The service was wonderful, they were very attentive and took into account our special occasion! I highly recommend eating here when coming to South Kensington or even making a trip if staying elsewhere in London.",

I started with a detox shot (I might have had a few at the pub in Oxford the previous night), and then a cappuccino. They were attentive, the food was tasty(I had the veggie breakfast with some OJ), and they put on some great music. Outside during the warmer months is right in the sun. For me, I stuck to the lounge area inside to relax and read some good articles. Check it out! I will definitely be returning!",

Longhorn pie was delicately cooked and the crust was perfect. The baked courgette with quinoa was so good I hope to replicate it! \u00a0The service was attentive and warm. I loved the charming atmosphere with fresh flowers and candle. We'd come here again if it wasn't 7 hours from home!",

    "text": "We came here per the recommendation of our hotel concierge. There were many options on the menu, all of which looked delicious. Our server suggested the Hake and Pork Belly with a side of mash. We also ordered the Baked Cheesecake.- The Hake was quite good.- The Pork Belly was tasty too however the skin seemed a little too burnt/crispy as it was difficult to cut and bite.- The mash and baked cheesecake were both okay. I think I just wasn't used to the richness of the dairy.Apparently there's a set menu: 2 courses for 15 or 3 courses for 20 (Monday-Thursday from 12PM-7PM).I will definitely visit a Bumpkin establishment the next time I am in London and have already recommended others to try it out.",

It does have a kids menu and there were lots of kids there. \u00a0Unfortunately the food was below average. \u00a0The burger was over cooked. \u00a0Any my fish was very average. \u00a0The fried were soggy. \u00a0 I'd pass. \u00a0You can do better in South Kensington.",
