    "text": "The Refinery has very recently opened so I was very much looking forward to sampling the lunch on a Friday afternoon. It is a spacious bar with a simple metallic type decor and an all day food menu with an emphasis on organic ingredients.I thought it would be nice to organise a work lunch which I have to say, I wasn't too impressed with. After speaking with the staff on a number of occasions prior to the day, I had arranged for a selection of mixed platters and emphasised that everyone would be quite hungry! On arrival, we had an area reserved but no table and the food wasn't nearly filling enough for the party - most people bought chips on the way back!The staff however are very attentive and friendly and I was really disappointed that the lunch wasn't too great. On an evening, I also feel that the bar lacks atmosphere - as a result of aiming to be ultra modern and chic, the Refinery consequently doesn't have an ounce of character or charm.",

I had the Cuban spritzer... which is a mojito strained and topped with prosecco... very refreshing and nice but at \u00a38 for a tiny glass it made me sad because I would have taken another 3 of them. I love the innovative cocktails here and I tried a small table bar appetizer and it wasn't bad... I haven't had a full meal there yet. I also like the arty and classy decor along with the clientele. I say if you are in the area why not try it...",

Had one of the best night's out in a long time, the music was fabulous (we specifically went for the 80s soul night), the crowd was fun-loving with no bad attitudes on display at all. The bar prices were pretty reasonable for a venue in London, in fact, I was stunned at buying at round for about 8 people and thinking I'd expected it to have cost double the amount I paid! Door staff and bar staff were all friendly and mega efficient. We had a reserved seating area but didn't order food as we were out for drinks and dancing, but I wish we'd sampled some of the food as everything else was so good! Toilets were clean and lots of them - I hate it when you go to a large venue and there are too few toilets! The smoking area was one of the coolest I've experienced in my life. There were high tables and stools and a couple of sofas but the best bit was the fact that they'd put out pashminas and scarves for people to keep warm when going out for a cigarette! The most considerate bar/club I've ever been to where smokers are concerned!",

Arrives finally but waiter darts from the table before taking breakfast order. Manage to coax him back. Latte is lukewarm. Notice now that others sat around me don't have food and are starting to look over at the kitchen with worried expressions on their faces. Food arrives prompty despite this. Looks good. Benedict has spinach, they must be confused. Spinach extracted and the flavours are ok. But again, lukewarm. All is perched on some woefully under-toasted muffins that turn doughy and heavy as time wears on. Need to be hot and crunchy. Hash browns prove to be highlight overall, which is a shame, as they were just a side. I think a plate of those next time. Want another coffee but wait staff doing their best at flying around looking incredibly busy. Don't think I'll bother coming back, plenty of better options in this area. Want to pay the bill. Think I might have to send up a flare...",

This place is very appealing \u00a0it's a large restaurant, nicely decorated and can accommodate everyone from couples to families to large groups. The menu has a lot of choice and variation. Although the food tasted nice, I was slightly disappointed with the service \u00a0it wasn't very busy but service was still a bit slow, albeit very friendly. One of our drinks was left behind by the waiter and this took about 15 minutes to catch up, and the time between sitting at the table and taking our order was a bit too long. My only other gripe and you may have read similar comments in other reviews I've posted \u00a0I'm not a fan of the fashionably pretentious way of serving chips/fries in strange objects it's most restaurants stick them in little buckets these days but the Refinery put mine in a cup and my wife's in a flower pot. Just stick them on the flippin' plate! Oh and my bill arrived tucked in to an old paperback book overlook all these silly things and you'll enjoy lovely food and drink.",

I'm certain to return (soon I hope) because it was a hard choice with lots of other items tempting me. Great coffee too.Aside from the food, I really like the eclectic decor and spacious setting.

The food quality was miles better than you normally get for a group xmas booking and the service was great.No Christmas music :-( but it was still the end of November (dont ask!). The menu choice was great, turkey, lamb, cod and pumpkin for the veggies. We pre-selected so no fussing over the menu on the day. I had duck pate for my starter, very meaty and served with pears and toasted bread, yummy! Turkey dinner for main, a big thick slice (like 2 inches!!!) of turkey breast with all the trimmings, really good qulaity. And a chocolate torte to finish ot all off...divine. As the host I asked the other diners what they thought of the other dishes and they all loved it. They set up a bar tab for us so we washed it all down with superb beer and prosecco. Couldn't fault it at all, def. a contender for next years outing. We had 25 of us and even though some people turned up very late no fuss was made by the staff they just rushed off and brought them whatever food they wanted. I have also eaten lunch here several times as its opposite my office, and the food has always been great, you'll pay around \u00a315 for lunch including drinks). Have also organised evening drinks here too and the staff are so helpful will tailor the night to whatever you want. Def worth a visit, any time of day",

    "text": "Tl;dr. Good cocktails, eclectic decor, friendly staff... *terrible* food.--So we ended up here yesterday due to it's proximity to the Tate Modern.On arrival the staff seemed really friendly and accommodating and it was good to get in from the rain. I noticed on the way in that all of the tables on the outside had little fleece blankets which I thought was a really thoughtful touch.The place looks cute on the inside, a big open space cross between the whole 'thrown together' aesthetic and a bit warehouse-y.We both ordered a cocktail - I had the skinny superfood collins and my husband had the blueberry margarita. No complaints there.Looking at the menu, the food is pretty much traditional pub food, but more expensive. We ordered the steak and chips (\u00a315) and I had the market fish and the scampi (\u00a310ish.) Unfortunately this is where they let themselves down. With my scampi and fish although the batter was light, it was still very greasy and left me feeling a bit queasy and the chips were horrible. A bit chewy and just not, well.. very nice tasting, cheap. The steak wasn't tender and had a lot of fat on it, in fact almost a third of it was fat. A noticeable weight in our pocket to take home to the dog... Unfortunately after our unappealing food, my opinion on the place changed a bit. My food was served on a chopping board, in a small imitation fry basket with a muslin cloth tied lemon. The steak also came on a board, with a small old fashioned style milk jug for the sauce and the chips came in a.. plant pot. The ladies next to us, I'm not sure what they had, but one of their starters came in a rather sizeable picnic hamper! I think that unfortunately it's a case of style over substance. If they paid as much attention to the quality of their food as they did in the eccentric and eclectic way they served their food they'd go along way. Their attention to detail seems to bypass the actually quality. Anyway - what's wrong with a plate?We spent \u00a350 and it just was not worth it. There's a \u00a0chance I'd go back for cocktails if we were in the area again, but I would never waste my money eating there.",

With vintage decorations, plants, teapots, candles, cute china, cocktails in mason jars and beautiful props around it's just a really lovely place to go with a lovely atmosphere. It's a little pricey but not excessively so. I've not eaten here but I've heard the food is great. The cocktails are outstanding and they have a decent wine list too. There's a nice area outside to sit in the summer too, just get there early as it does get busy.If you're not around London Bridge/Southwark, check out The Folly near Monument or The Parlour in Canary Wharf. I think they might have another one too \u00a0but I'm not sure off the top of my head.",

    "text": "Absolutely the worst service I have encountered in years. I'm not exaggerating when I say it took the staff over a half hour to take our very first drink order, and the drinks (some of them incorrect) arrived exactly ONE HOUR after we had first sat down. Things only went downhill from there. Not one person's order was executed correctly. I have a pretty high tolerance for mistakes - no one is perfect. But what I cannot tolerate is attitude. On top of shocking incompetence, our main waitress rolled her eyes at every single request we made. \"Could we have more water, please?\" elicited an eye roll. \"Could I please see the drinks menu again?\" got us another eye roll. It never stopped. She was rude, dismissive, and gave the clear message that we were a significant annoyance to her. And my group is full of respectful, low maintenance people who have all previously held wait-staff jobs, so we go out of our way to be polite and easy at restaurants. Of all the fantastic restaurants in London, I'm disgusted that we wasted a rare sunny afternoon at this restaurant. Never again.",

Mainly with work, we're always looking for places to go that are a bit away from our usual drinking spots, so the Refinery (a 5 minute cab ride away) is perfect.I came here last night for a friend's birthday drinks - table/ one of those bar stool sized benches was reserved in perfect stumbling distance to the bar! Good drinks (a bit overpriced) but service was nice and it's never too busy.I've also been here for a Sunday brunch. We were seated at a long table - the staff were really understanding about our constantly changing numbers. But we were put right next to the door which was cold when it kept being left open. I had the full English breakfast (nice touch serving it in a cast iron pan), all very tasty and filled me up. For about \u00a38 that's not too bad either. Also a chemex filter drip which was filled with really nice coffee! My friend (not the scientist like me) had real fun filtering the hot water through - just like high school science! The waitress could NOT figure out how to do this properly, awkward..There were two other issues - a friend ordered crumpets that were stone cold in the middle. NOT GOOD. also we couldn't get hold of the waitress to pay and leave... side not, why is it SO DIFFICULT in restaurants to pay and leave, especially if you're in a hurry!! I don't get it, do they not want our money... hmm.",

The staff are very friendly, helpful and always willing to suggest a cocktail.On that note, here are my top two tips to enjoy the Refinery: first, try the cocktails, plus the wines and beers are also good, but I'd avoid the food as it's not always up to scratch. Tip number two is avoid peak times - this place can get very packed, so my favourite time to visit is Saturday after lunch or another off-peak time.",

Not a game changer and not so much a scene that it's going to redefine your weekend breakfast routine, but without a lot of options in this area on a sleepy Sunday, it satisfies.The decor is like a midcentury meets minimalist mish mash. Not everything matches and it lends to an eclectic look. Food wise I went with the bangers and mash. It was a little pricier than the more pedestrian versions of this famous British dish, but it was also elevated enough to justify the jump in cost. Added a Bloody Mary and it was just the thing to start the day.If you're staying somewhere in the 'hood (Citizen M hotel, for instance), you'll find plenty to warrant a quick bite.",

    "text": "This experience was rather mediocre. I escaped the rain with a friend for some brunch, but their brunch menu was not on. Ordered a club sandwich, which was not great as the bread was hardly toasted. We also ordered coffees that took entirely too long to arrive considering how few people were in the restaurant. The worst part was the fire alarm went off, which happens but it delayed everyone's food. They at least told us this, but for ordering a sandwich and a salmon salad our food still came late and was so unmemorable I doubt I will go again, especially as it overpriced. You are better off across the street at The Table!",

    "text": "I had always wanted to try this place and ended up going here last Sunday for my friend's bday. We had a nice long table (there were around 12 of us) and the restaurant was probably half full. On arrival we were handed menus with the specials and roasts on and half the group were massively excited to get the roast beef. On ordering, they were told that there was none left. This was a massive and disappointing oversight and we weren't at all impressed especially as no alternative was offered. When the server returned we suggested substituting for a steak dish and this was agreed though it was a little stressful and shouldn't have got to this! Personally I had the scampi and fish basket which was nice but not plentiful with nice chips and tartare sauce. We had a delicious bottle of Malbec. If I could've fitted it in I would've gone for the alcoholic tiramisu pudding as it sounded amazing! Now I've tried it not sure I'd return in a rush but it was nice enough with good food and drinks and at typical London prices. Handy Southwark location between London Bridge and Waterloo.",

Chocolate brownie with ice cream.... Plate dusted with powdered sugar and three fresh raspberries and to top it iff hot fudge sauce in a little cup to pour in yourself.

Colleagues who had the burger said the patty was dry. Others who had the salmon and the chicken said it was really good. DRINKSI had the flat white and it was not good. Way, way to milky for a FW. Some others had the juice of the say and said it was good. SERVICEGreat service for lunchtime. Only saw 3 servers for the whole restaurant so they must do a good job although wasn't too busy. Food came out in a good time. ATMOSPHERENice interiors. Boho chic. Like the long picnic tables and the bar area. Would like to try it out for drinks. OVERALLGreat food for what you pay, good service, and hopefully good cocktails. I want to visit again - just won't be my work-break coffee joint.",

We had sausages and mash, seafood risotto (a special), the Sunday roast and fish and chips. Prices may be a bit high, but for what you get its well worth it. Can't go wrong!",
