    "text": "I've been to Mala several times now, and being of Indian heritage, I've got a good idea of what's good Indian food, and what isn't. With this restaurant being around the corner from where I work, it's often suggested for a lunch treat.First off, Mala is almost hidden away in a far end corner of St Katherine's Dock, but once you arrive there, the restaurant is spacious and there's more than enough room for diners not to be clashing into each other. It's rather a breath of (London) fresh air to be in a restaurant where you're not packed in like cattle.About 75% of the time I've been though, I've always noticed a little fly hovering around the table we're seated at. If that continues, I'm probably going to end up naming it.The waiters are impeccably dressed and very polite, and generally pretty decent at taking your order and fetching it. Don't expect much in the way of banter with them - it'll just confuse the poor souls.I've also witnessed a waiter accidentally knock over a glass of red wine over a member of our party (and her lovely dress), and then at the end of the meal, to have offered to only strike the Red Wine off the bill. Not cool, at all.The food itself is alright though - I usually opt for the Non Veg Thali, which is a mix of dishes. Naan bread, Lamb dishes, Chicken dish, a Potato mix and a pot of veg and what I think is meant to be Raita, but just tastes rather boring. For a mere \u00a310, you won't be leaving hungry after all that.Do note that if you do go at lunchtime, by default they'll give you the 'cut down' version of the full menu, to guide you to just order the dishes they can get out quickly (mainly the Thalis). If you want to see their full menu, ask for it.Unlike Dishoom, the Mango Lassi at Mala is spot on - thick, flavoursome and plentiful. Though a jug will set you back about \u00a313, which is quite the markup!So overall, Mala is a nice place to go. It's not stunning, but you won't be paying over the odds, the food is decent and though the service can be sketchy, the setting itself is nice enough.",

The majority of the tables offer an excellent view from large windows around the restaurant.The service was excellent with our waiter being attentive without overcrowding us and provided both enthusiasm and a repertoire of entertaining jokes while taking and delivering our order. The service was also quite fast despite the restaurant being quite busy.Being Indian and brought up on curries, I'm usually quite critical of Indian restaurants. Mala managed to bring an element on home cooking into their food that I greatly appreciated after sampling far too many places that have westernised traditional dishes to cater to the more delicate British palate.The lamb jalfrezi and chicken roganjosh were both excellently cooked, with delicate flavours being supported by the rich bases and for once not overwhelmed by spice. These aren't dishes that will scorch your tongue so if fire is your flavour then you might be disappointed. The chicken biriyani was intriguing as it was served in an almost deconstructed fashion. I personally prefer the melding of flavours when the biriyani rice, meat, and sauces are cooked together but the dish, once put together, was still pleasing.The garlic naan needed more garlic but was still satisfactory and the mango lassi was thick and savoury (as it should be!).Pricewise, the meal for 7 of us came to 125 squids which is pretty reasonable given the quality and amount of food we consumed.",

I had the Multigawny soup (really a blended lentil soup with lots of cream and coconut - tasty), Chicken Tikka Masala (average/good) - not as tangy as I have experienced in the US - the chicken was a bit subpar - dry and not cooked well. The paratha was very good - a buttery layered version of a naan. The waiters are polite but they don't seem to give a darn. At no time during my meal did anyone ask how I was doing. Despite there being only 2 other couples in the place, it took 25 minutes to be served, and my water glass was frequenly empty. Every time I went to the bathroom there were waiters in there fixing their hair. And the end, I finished and waited, and finally had to look all around and hunt them down behind a closed door to get my check. They dont care because they get an automatic service charge/tip. It cost me about 25 pounds ($40) (1 soup, 1 entre, 1 bread) - about double what it would have cost in the US. Its not a bad place, but there are plenty of other places in London much cheaper.",

And it really is quite fantastic. Don't come here if you're expecting searing spicy curries that will burn your taste buds off; the curries here are remarkably complex. Much like a wine tasting (minus the snobbery often associated with self-declared wine aficionados perhaps), we found ourselves trying to pick apart the various spices and dominant notes of each dish. Although everything was excellent, everyone completely loved the Lamb Tikka Bhuna, the Goan Fish Curry, and the Dal Makhani. Portions are small and prices are relatively high, but even for cost-conscious new graduates, we felt it was worth every penny.I've had \"haute Indian\" cuisine in New York before and left entirely unimpressed. It had seemed to me, at least until now, that having waiters in tuxedos was merely an excuse to charge $7 per bowl of rice. While Mala indeed charges for plain basmati rice, it was a much more pleasant exchange. (Good food for good money? Deal. ) The best and probably most cost-effective way to experience Mala is family-style, provided that your tablemates aren't hoarding greedy pigs. It's never fun when you feel like you have to grab your \"portion\" of everything when someone's clearly trying his best to get his money's worth. But with good company, you can share multiple dishes, tasting a bit of everything, all for under \u00a320.",

Delicious, although a bit much and could not finish but half the rice - should have stuck with my initial inclination to go with just the lamb and the aloo / baingan. I asked for some fresh green chillies to go with the food and he obliged.Then came the Mango Kulfi - delicious but I was not hoping for a little stick of it, but a small bowl. He must have known how ridiculous the portion was (even if it did come with a rolled wafer with chocolate on the inside) and must have seen my expression, as he let out a little laugh without me even saying a word.

Location is good but I don't think I would go here again",

We had reserved months ahead since we were a party of seven, it was the evening of the London Marathon and we were celebrating a special birthday. We were late by an hour--they accommodated. Our first table was next to a noisy and even larger group--they moved us swiftly and professionally. \u00a0Vegetarian options? No problem. Complimentary champagne, appetizers and dessert? YUP...and totally unexpected. \u00a0Our group of foodies from around the US (including NYC and Portland, OR) spent five days in London--including lunch at Ottolenghi--and we all rated Mala #1.",

The staff were all very friendly and only too happy to help. \u00a0The interior of the restaurant is also very neat, tidy and clean. They also seem to cater from couples to some quite very large groups. Will definitely be making return trips here in future.",

Must be something to do with me, since they seemed to treat the other guests a bit better. Maybe an Indian wanting to dine alone is not welcome here.Food taste: 3 out of 5Health factor: 1 out of 5 (the chole had equal amounts of oil and chick peas... the peas were almost floating in the oil. It takes a genius to ruin Channa Masala).To their credit, the location is terrific though, and the food arrived very soon after I ordered.And oh, they chose to include a mandatory 12.5% service tax in the bill. \u00a0This was not even optional. \u00a0As far as I know service charges in London are optional. Overall, London has a ton of other nicer Indian restaurants. Not worth wasting a meal here.",

    "text": "Fantastic! If you're ever at the Tower of London/Tower Hill area and get hungry for dinner, Mala is the place to go (especially if you have out-of-town guests to impress, like I did). And especially if you're super hungry. We were very happy with it.The first thing we noticed was on the walk there - it's on a little inlet with a bunch of boats next to the river. Beautiful with the reflections of light at night, and one of the many times where I have a moment of how much I love all the different facets of London.Inside, the space is large and inviting, with lovely decor and low lighting. There weren't many people here on a quiet Sunday night - all the better for us.I had a Mango Lassi to drink, my first time to try a lassi. It's a thick, filling yoghurt drink, but sooo delicious. Also, tandoori vegetables/cheese (Paneer & Subzi Tandoori Shasli), cheese naan, and Indian donuts and ice cream for dessert. And the best poppadum I've ever had (a crispy tortilla-like starter accompanied by three types of sauces) I was stuffed!Tip: My companions ordered meat/seafood platters, and were told they were per person, but they were HUGE. Two people could definitely share one, especially if you get a starter as well.",

The jalfrezi was thought to be the best we'd ever tasted. The tikka masala was amazing and the tandoori was boneless, a first, since usually it has the bone. Everything was fantastic, highly recommend! Great staff and location, right on the boat docs over by Tower Bridge. Very good, highly recommend!",

Many dishes feature the flavors of ginger, coriander and onion and garlic. While I have had better Indian food in London I would recommend this place. It was quite crowded both Friday (when I went early) and Saturday ( when I went late) nights. \u00a0Still they took walk ins and I was seated quickly. Onion naan was very good and the portions are sized perfectly. One issue is that their selection of wine by the glass is extremely limited. You don't go to an Indian restaurant for grape wine but the bottle list is pretty long. Why not the same for by the glass selections?Decor is clean bright and real spacious; a lively atmosphere and fine for kids. If they make a fuss no one will notice in all likelihood.",
