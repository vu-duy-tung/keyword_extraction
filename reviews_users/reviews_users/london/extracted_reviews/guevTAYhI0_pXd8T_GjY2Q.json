    "text": "I was a little worried about booking the Bull & Last... we very much wanted to try a gastropub during our trip from Miami, but recent reviews said the hype had sent the service and even the quality a bit downhill.Disagree.It still has a good, traditional pub feel - not overly slick or trendy. The service was friendly and unassuming. The menu sticks with real British fare, including numerous cuts and dishes that will be surprising changes for American palates. We shared delicious anchovies and some vegetable fritters to start. Excellent fish and chips to erase the memory of a mediocre old pub near Trafalgar, and a dish they called confit veal belly that had the appearance of an American skirt steak and the texture of slow-cooked roast. Of course, a great selection of unique beers and a pretty good selection of modestly priced wines. Strong recommendation for a great night.",

The food made us forget all about the dogs, and the dessert (the aforementioned ice cream as well as a spectacular chocolate orange sorbet) made me want to scrap our return plane tickets and just move into the private dining room upstairs. \u00a0All in all, an amazing place that is well worth the trek from central London.",

But that was just the final incentive to go somewhere I'd heard great reports about for ages. I ordered the pea and parmesan gnocchi, which arrived in a satisfyingly generous portion, with lots of very rich, creamy mushroom sauce and plenty of girolles and fresh peas. Delicious: the gnocchi were pillowy and soft, the whole thing summery, fresh, satisfying. My friends enjoyed a huge plate of fish and chips, and venison shoulder with mash and blackberry sauce. It was hard to choose between a really tempting selection of desserts: my chef-friend decided I'd like the chocolate mousse, which came in a large slice, on top of a hazlenut brownie base..really, really good. My friends had a slice with the advertised ice cream and boozy cherries, and we all shared an excellent fresh fig tart tatin with some crushed caramel, and some ginger icecream melting oozily over the top. Brilliant. Can't wait to go back!",

It also has a named steeped in history, taking the 'last' from the cry of coachmen as this was the last stop before London. All this conjures images of an old fashioned local's pub. These images fade as you walk into a gastro pub so food orientated that most of the tables are laid out with cutlery and glasses ready. Maybe the food is particularly good, but I go restaurants primarily for food and I go to pubs primarily for drink, so a pub that seems to discourage people who only want to sup baffles me. Fortunately it was summer so there were tables outside where drinking was not frowned upon. However these days there is less fresh air outside pubs than inside!",

    "text": "Full review and photos at thahappinessprojectlondo\u2026  North London does Sunday pub lunch places really well. There's the Scolt Head in Dalston, the Drapers Arms in Islington, and countless places littered around Hampstead. I was recommended The Bull & Last by a friend who spent the entire tube journey from Kentish Town to Clapham North telling me how shit Clapham is for boozers (I agree \u00a0but I actually live in Brixton/Herne Hill which is pretty good, hello The Prince Regent and The Florence , so ner). I was visiting the gorgeous Sapphire with The Chef so decided to pop in, especially as it's sister pub to the Prince of Wales in Putney which he's always banging on about. What I didn't know is that it's a bit of an institution \u00a0while we were there countless locals, tourists and non-Northerners turned up to a 2-hour table wait, some of whom had taken an expensive taxi across London to get there. It's also Giles Coren's local which he raves about, calling it some of the best pub food I've ever eaten. The Chef said something along the lines of it was the best pub roast he'd ever had in London. So you get the picture. My suggestions are: book a table because there were streams of people coming in and being told to wait for hours. We didn't and we were very lucky to get a seat. Eat a home-made giant Scotch egg (\u00a33 bargain) at the bar \u00a0runny egg and lovely meat, delicious. If necessary, have a spicy Bloody Mary (\u00a36.50) pre-lunch. And a nice bottle of red over lunch \u00a0it's worth taking your time over. We had a Monastrell Syrah (\u00a319 ) but they sell Altos Los Hormigas, the malbec I drank in Argentina and the vineyward where my friend Aileen works, another good sign. I got a pretty much non-stop commentary from The Chef on the merits of the food \u00a0alternated with eating happily in silence. It was fantastic. The charcuterie board of duck (\u00a310) was delicious and interesting and brilliant value \u00a0proscuitto was lovely and the ducks' tongues tasty quack and the rillettes fatty and good and the terrine rough and tasty and loved the sides of celeriac and guerkins and pineapple chutney to take the edge off the fat (The Chef's commentary) and the soft parfait pate was to die for and I hate the phrase to die for but it's appropriate here. And then the partridge roast (\u00a314) \u00a0I know nothing about partridges apart from their propensity to sit in pear trees and don't think I've ever eaten one. But it was delicious and rich and meaty and came with rich gravy that had reduced for hours (The Chef's commentary), chestnuts, foie gras with partridge heart and liver, bright green cabbage, chipolata wrapped in bacon, roast potatoes and carrots. Man, my mouth is watering just writing about it, and it was truly delicious. Much more than a roast you could do at home and than you get in most pubs. There were extra tastes and flavours and time and love put into every plate. Come to think of it, that comment came from The Chef too. Anyway, for all that grub and booze (we were stuffed and a bit tipsy) it came to \u00a336 each so it's not an everyday Sunday lunch place unless, well, you can afford to live in Kentish Town. It would certainly be the perfect birthday / celebration Sunday place. The staff were super lovely - a perfect mix between friendly and organised \u00a0and it was the kind of place we could have stayed for hours, regretting leaving before pud (and The Chef before a second bottle of wine). Hugely recommended and if you can't make it North then go to its Putney sister \u00a0only don't take an expensive cab across London to get there unless you've booked beforehand.",

Bull & Last, which I have been intending to go to for so long but somehow haven't managed to visit until last weekend, completely blew my mind! The restaurant is quite small, very 'pub-y', loud with an amazing atmosphere. As soon as I sat down there was a jug of tap water with ice in front of me (I like it when I don't have to ask for TAP water and feel cheap but get it automatically). First we had some mulled wine, which was comforting and nice and got me a little drunk. Very nice. We got a bottle of really nice red as well, which was decently priced. We ordered some little bits and bobs to snack on while waiting for our main. Oh and then. Then. Then came the steak. A massive 900g cote de boeuf, served with triple cooked chips (HEAVEN) and bearnaise (also HEAVEN). We ordered it rare and out came one of the best steaks I've had in London. No words can describe. Except maybe the waitress', who came by only to say that she's never seen anyone finish that steak so fast. In some mysterious way unknown to me, my dinner companion decided to have dessert, but I was too full to even look at it. Actually, that's not true at all, I tasted it and it was very nice, rich rich chocolate with a shot of espresso and vanilla ice cream. All in all... I am now obsessed with Bull & Last. You should be, too. I live a bit too far away to make a regular though, but it's certainly worth the detour (although it's quite a scary walk from Tufnell Park station). Go! Go! Go!",

But the food is, of course, just as good - my parents both had the onglet and loved it; I had the fish and chips and it was great! The peas weren't overly pureed, the breading was crispy... all in all, a very good pub fish and chips. The pub itself is on the outskirts of Kentish Town, just past Gospel Oak overground station. A bit easy to miss. But worth it - for the food, at least. There's not a lot of space to stand around and have a pint after work, unfortunately.",

The downstairs pub and dinning area was busy but upstairs was surprisingly quiet and a number of tables were free. The service was friendly and helpful. We had a nice vermouth and soda to start and then all ordered roast beef. The options were limited - beef or pork or some standard pub fare (fish and chips, pasta etc). The roasts were nice but nothing to write home about. The deserts though were spectacular - especially the melting chocolate afogato pudding!!",

There's limited space in the downstairs pub which allows dogs but as long as you book in advance you're guaranteed a spot. The upstairs is for those who'd like to have a romantic evening meal or formal gatherings. The food here is amazing, probably better than most 1 Michelin star places. The starter platters are really good for sharing, we went for both the fish platter and charcuterie. They were both amazing with lovely pates, calamari, bread, meat selection. But if you do opt for starters the main might be too much so I went for another starter the lamb ragu and also a side seasonal salad which was plenty. The cod did look amazing with nice truffle sauce and also the steak with chunky chips. All really good quality top notch food and service. The dogs got to make new friends too so it was a win for all of us.",

It does annoy me when pubs are turned into primarily eating establishments rather than drinking venues. We're loosing so much of our national identity these days and the number of gastro pubs is another example of this. Yes there is a place for them but like chicken shops, betting shops, loan shops, coffee shops lets limit the numbers and not make every high st in the UK look predominately the same. Every gastro pub I've ever been in is void of any charm and are generally lifeless boring places to eat.This is true of this place. The food is good but why can't it be a pub first, eating venue second. There's usually a few weeks reservation wait for a table at peak times but if you come in on the off and sit down to drink at the bar your greeted with funny looks and distain. I'd suggest you choose a different place to drink if that's what your after.",

    "text": "A few weeks ago, I had visitors from Germany and after a day sightseeing (Buckingham Palace, etc) all we wanted to do was to sit down at a local pub and rest our feet. And while I'd never been to the Bull & Last before, I had followed their reviews on Yelp and thus decided to take them here.And what we saw was a delight for our sore feet and eyes...a typical English pub that had now been uplifted to a (relatively) posh local gastro pub...buzzing with clientele from the surrounding area as well as people who'd been for a stroll through the nearby Heath. \u00a0We followed the recommendations of the bar staff when it came to making a decision on beer and I was happy to hear that they serve quite a few local ales - on tap as well as in bottles. My German friends especially liked this and they remarked that even though we have thousands of different beers in Germany, the Wirtsh\u00e4user usually serve the standard beers.On this first visit, I only got to experience their liquid treasures, but I made a firm mental bookmark to come back soon and try their food as well...and sooner thought than done, I found myself back here a few weeks later. This time it was me and my dog who'd come here. I hadn't made a reservation, but there were a few unreserved tables near the bar, where I sat down. The wait staff, like last time, was very friendly and helpful and soon I'd settled on the beef cheeks on sp\u00e4tzle, prunes & rainbow chard. Alongside that, I ordered a local beer, which came swiftly. (They even offered my dog a pigs ear!) \u00a0 The food was really nice - the beef cheeks melted on my tongue. The sweetness of the prunes (wrapped in some kind of bacon) complimented the bitterness of the chard and so all in all I felt that all my senses were nicely stimulated.All in all, I really can recommend this place - both as a stop-over for a quick beer as well as a longer pit-stop for some good grub. HOWEVER, and I feel I had to write this in capital letters, this ain't a cheap place. In fact, I think it is rather expensive. For example, a 0.33l bottle of the local ale came to \u00a35.20, my beef cheeks were \u00a319 and on top of that they added 12.5% gratuity so that my overall meal came to some \u00a327. Thus, I will be back, but probably not as often as I'd like to. PS: You can order picnic baskets from them, which you can pick up before you're heading over to the Heath. I thought this was a very neat idea - although the prices, once again, shocked me a little ;-)",

From the reviews and photos of this place, I had high hopes that the travel time would be worth it, and for the most part this place lived up to them.The bar looks like a classic British pub with some slightly funky decor choices, notably the huge bull (and cow?) heads mounted over the bar, and columns of old door locks running up the walls. The menu would make a vegetarian think twice about entering and a meat eater think twice about ever leaving. The charcuterie plate was tremendous, with luscious chicken liver mousse, rich duck prosciutto, hearty ham hock terrine, and rabbit rillettes which were the only thing I wasn't enamored with. For the main course two of us spilt the cote de boeuf with chips, and it came out in thick slabs on a giant rib done a little closer to rare than the medium rare we had ordered but otherwise excellent. Their ice cream menu alone could have justified a trip, and they make a mean old fashioned to boot. The only glitch in the evening was our somewhat inattentive server, but she was young and might have been new.I'm sure there are plenty of restaurants in London where you can get steak, but the combination of food, drink, and atmosphere made this place stand out. Next time you're in town come get your fleshy fix and freak PETA out!",

On the inside (and by inside, this means your menu), you are a fine eatery camouflaged by a regular stomping ground.For a whirlwind visit, I was introduced to a very warm and welcoming pub that is intimate and yet completely relaxed. Whether you're coming to enjoy a few pints or indulge your taste buds on fares that change daily--know that satisfaction is key. With this particular visit, we sat in one of the few wooden tables and started the evening out with olives and sweet anchovies. After eating the anchovies, you may not want to do heavy kissing afterward--but for the time being in the pub, it was delicious and worth every succulent bite. Feeling a little adventurous, I chose the beef tartare and fell in love. The meat was perfectly tangy with just the right amount of seasoning and capers to keep it tart and beautiful. Toppled off with a soft egg, the yolk brought the entire dish together. One in our group had the Dedham Vale which was cooked to perfection. The meat itself was tender and melted amazingly in your mouth. This is a place where you could find yourself slinking away to after a hard day. Sipping a pint, or a glass of wine and giving into the fine foods on the menu. Fully knowing you're indulging, but the indulgence stems from a chef's heart. Would definitely return to try something else off of the menu, and am jealous for friends that get to dine all of the time.",

Booked a table about a week in advance for Sunday at 6:30 as this was the only time left (the place is well popular!). Had our meals all picked out days beforehand, only to get there and find out they only do roasts for Sunday lunch, and don't serve them after 4pm! We were GUTTED. I can't find anywhere on the B&G website that states this, so there's no way we could have known. The manager was very apologetic about it, but it didn't make up for the expected lovely hunk of lamb on my plate. We ended up having a great meal paired with a lovely Portuguese red: charcuterie board (outstanding), steak tartare, soup, venison, onglet steak...all absolutely delicious and well cooked (and I think the chips that came with the onglet are probably the best chips I've ever tasted - not a statement made lightly; golden and crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside). We sat upstairs, which was a bit more subdued than we would have liked. Maybe they need more tables up there, or to turn the music up a bit. Feels a little empty. They were also out of scotch eggs at the downstairs bar :(Dining is a bit on the expensive side for a pub, so value for money isn't amazing, but quality is good and it's good for a little splurge once in a while after a brisk walk on the Heath.",

We'd walked past it many times, gazed longingly into the beautiful dining room, and saw plates of attractive food and happy people.So, the other night, we booked a table to try it out for ourselves. I love the \"jungle\" entrance, you feel like you're walking through the wardrobe to another world! The room is lovely, and it creates a very nice, bustling atmosphere. And the menu looked spot on, plenty of things I'd be happy ordering. We settled on the veggie frito misto to share for starters, followed by fish & chips, roast cod, and steak. So far so good, the beer was good \u00a0and the service pleasant. The food came quickly. Veggie frito misto was good, but not exceptional - \"tempura but not as good\" was the comment on the table. Then the mains... Hmm.... First off, there is a massive issue with balance. The fish & chips was huge; the roast cod was small; the steak in the middle. I'd finished my cod before the fish & chip eater had even got going. This is not good for dinner conversation and \"social comfort\"; it's also not good for bill splitting (the roast cod being +60% the price of the fish & chips). Balance up your menu, folks!The food itself... Hmm.... My cod wasn't too warm, it also wasn't too flavourful, In concept, great, in execution it rather lacked something. The fish & chips, despite the size, was a massive disappointment - thick and chewy batter, and the fish (once you'd fished it out of the batter) wasn't particularly good. Onglet steak was good, chewy and flavourful - rather rare (which was fine for us but beware); the sauce was disappointing.Not feeling inclined to have desert, having been stuffed full with batter, we paid an moved on. It's not cheap and for this money I'd expect much better. Very hard to justify coming back.",

My friend and I had walked past Bull & Last on one of our previous trips to Hampstead Heath, but this time we returned for the popular restaurant on a cloudy Sunday afternoon better spent indoors. The menu is one of those that are printed daily and could easily vary; I ordered the roast pork belly and my friend got the homemade charcuterie board, and we both got the 5 Point Pale Ale. My favourite part about my dish isn't even in the description: lovely roasted broccolini covered in a beautiful gravy that I definitely could not hope to replicate at home. The roasted potatoes were one of those that must have been covered in duck fat, a perfect golden yellow, while the pork belly was paired with a lovely apple sauce. I didn't try any of the charcuterie board, but it had five different types of meat on it- definitely not your average plate! This place has a fantastic neighbourhood feel and is certainly worth stopping by if you are going to the heath.",
