I like to go during the week during 'beat-the-clock' times from 5 to 6:30 p.m, where the moral of the story is that you pay for the time you arrive. There is a specific menu for this, and I always go for the Moules Mariniere Traditionnelle with frites and a glass of house white wine (all included with the price). The Green Thai mussel pot from the main menu is interesting but nevertheless, tasty. And be sure to check out their drinks list, with an extensive range of beers - I always go for the flavoured ones!The interior is interesting, I wouldn't say welcoming as such, tucked under ground level, it has an almost stiff industrial feel to it... the toilets are interesting.",

    "text": "Each time I visit my relatives in London, they always take me to this restaurant. The first time I came here, I had the salmon fillet and it was delicious! The sauce on top of it was perfectly made--not too sweet and not salty, just plain savory. We also had the salmon cakes appetizers and they were so freakin' good. If I didn't want to look like a rude and greedy pig, I would've ate all of them myself. The last time here, I ordered the roast duck breast and I was just plain disappointed! I expected the texture to be like a juicy peking duck but I realized this place isn't a Chinese restaurant. The duck was slightly chewy and the plum sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking. Since my friend ordered the salmon fillet, I dipped my duck in her sauce so I can finish chowing down and move on to dessert. We all shared the creme brulee and it was decent--nothing special. For the price, I recommend getting dessert elsewhere. Also, my niece and nephew's food was free because for every adult ordering a main course, each child eats for free. Is it just me that thinks this special is super cute? Their specialties are mussels, chips, and beer. Chips were pretty good but nothing amazing. Mussels aren't my cup of tea so I can't give you my opinion but my cousins LOVE them here. Beer? I definitely have to try it next time. Overall, this place is okay... I think I would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't so expensive but hey, it's London.",

    "text": "I had arranged a team Christmas dinner here upon recommendation by a colleague. The booking staff went out of the way to accommodate the party of 17 at fairly late notice and were prompt with offering a variety of options for those with diet restrictions. Most interestingly, we could place our orders from the Xmas set menu after reaching the venue, rather than having to pre-order the main course, which saved a lot of headache in terms of coordinating the team dinner.The bar upstairs made for a good hangout before dinner and once it was time, we were ushered quite promptly onto the benches and served a variety of schnaaps to warm us up. The waitress came around and took our orders quickly and voila, in a few minutes, we had our starters - I was clearly a Belgo novice. If I had known better, I would have gone for the Thai Green Mussels which looked like a delight even from a distance (noted for my next visit). My chicken liver parfait with cranberry and port chutney was nice but seemed somewhat underwhelming as an entry into a Christmas meal. Those who had ordered Belgian beer croquettes (with piccalilli & fried parsely) & chilled beer asparagus (with vinaigrette) seemed to have polished off their appetisers rather quickly - not sure whether it was because it was tasty or that they were served in smaller portion sizes.For mains, I had ordered the beef carbonnade, beef braised in sweet Gueuze beer with apples and plums, with a side of frites and I absolutely loved it! It was a definite score for the right blend of tender meat and sweet after-tastes. The portion size was just right, filling but it didn't leave me feeling stuffed, like Christmas meals tend to do. Another sign of me being a Belgo novice is that I did not even look at the beer menu - what was I thinking, right? I just went for a glass of the house red which paired well with the beef. Among my colleagues' orders, the half rotisserie chicken was served in generous portions, the sausage & mash looked alright but a tad on the scarce side and the salmon fillet looked like a good order too, but the winner seemed to be the moules, yet again.For dessert, I had a light dark chocolate mousse served with a coffee Anglaise and as promised, it's light and not very sweet - a satisfying even if a safe choice. Those who went for the winterberry pavlova (wth fresh cream+mulled wine coulis) seemed very happy with their choice too. I have also noted that I will want to try their Belgian waffle the next time I visit.Service was prompt and friendly and the tasty food kept me occupied enough to not mind the usual tiresome banter amongst work crowd :P At \u00a324.95/set before service, it was a reasonably priced fare. Definitely coming back for the moules+frites!",

The glass bowl entrance leads to a steel staircase down and then through a hall, which deposits you in front of the long, open, and very busy kitchen. To left and right are rooms with long wooden beer hall tables. The bustle and noise is considerable: not a place for a quiet romantic rendez-vous. The food was excellent, though, if not cheap. And the beers: well, there are dozens of Balgian types, on tap or bottled, trappist to wheat to chocolate. Until the end of October 2008 they have on their Oktoberfeast deal: a three-course menu of several choices paried with specially-selected beers for each course at \u00a327.50. Or the food alone is \u00a319.95, letting you pick your beers. There's a minimum of 2 people required to order this menu. Not everyone in my group was convinced by their beer pairings, but I liked mine. Everyone thought the food was great: my asparagus starter was perfectly cooked, and my bowl of mussels proved meaty and delicious.",

The Thai Curry mussels were exquisite, as well as the goat cheese starter. My meal of roasted duck breast was easily the best at the table; it was cooked perfectly on a bed of silky smooth mashed potatoes and perfectly seasoned sauce.The service at this restaurant was brilliant, renewing my faith in English customer service. It was a complete 180 degrees from your disgruntled London pub barkeep. (Who were probably annoyed with me because I was a tourist but hey, in this town who isn't?)This was actually my second time at Belgo, the first being for beer and desserts. The chocolate cheese cake is light and delicious and perfectly hits the spot. If you are interested in Belgian beer, this is definitely the place to go. For the full beer menu, you need to go downstairs to the restaurant. The small upstairs bar as a very limited menu.All in all Belgo is a great restaurant. And with plenty of room downstairs, they will have room for you on a busy Saturday night when every place else is filled to the brim.",

However, the thai green curry mussels were by far the best! I count this dish as one of the two most delicious things I've had during my 4 month stay in London.The sauce was so flavorful, the best green thai curry I've ever had. I actually don't even like mussels that much because it usually ends up being too chewy, but these were cooked perfectly. Each portion comes with a Kilo of mussels, which is good enough for two people to share. It also come with a side of chips. The other flavors we ordered were good, but they weren't memorable and were clearly no match for the green thai curry ones. We only had mussels during my one time there, but looking around to the food on other tables, they all looked quite good. So, therefore, the green thai curry mussels are what compels me to give this place 5 stars! Please order this if you come here! The only downside to this place, in my experience, was that we couldn't take home our leftovers, which was a shame!",

    "text": "Lobsterfest Belgo's - Pics The London Foodie (thelondonfoodie.co.uk/20\u2026 ) Just as 17 years ago when I lived in Chalk Farm and first started going to Belgo Noord, today I am still struck by the originality of the ideas introduced by this restaurant to the London food scene. Not only has it made moules frites an affordable and accessible choice, but it has also introduced a vast range of top quality Belgian beers to many Londoners. Few people were familiar with Belgian food in the UK in the early 90s; dishes like Waterzooi and Beef Carbonnade were relatively unknown, and the concept of partnering food and beer was also novel. Belgo also introduced us to the concept of cuisine a la bi\u00e8re where beer is used as a marinade, sauce or flavouring, and I cannot think of any other type of beer which would be more appropriate to this style of cooking. The meat in Beef Carbonnade is braised in sweet Gueuze, a sparkling sour beer, while the slow cooked shank of lamb is served with DeKoninck beer and balsamic jus. The idea of preparing and cooking mussels can be a frightening prospect, but at \u00a312.95 for a large pot, eating moules frites is no longer a daunting or expensive affair. Belgo was also one of the first restaurants to open its kitchens to the public, when the concept of open plan kitchen was still to be adopted and popularised by other restaurant chains. The design of its restaurants is as cutting edge as when it first opened. I like the combination of different elements like the exposed bricks against the copper walls, the long canteen style wooden tables and the roughly polished cement floor. These elements come together helping to create a modern and vibrant restaurant. Dr G and I went to Belgo to try the 2010 Lobsterfest menu which is available throughout the month of June. All the dishes that we ordered, apart from the desserts, were lobster based. For starter, Dr G had a Red Thai lobster @ \u00a38.95 (half a Canadian 1lb lobster baked with a lightly spiced and nutty red Thai curry sauce). I am not one to mess around with lobster (I prefer mine simply grilled with garlic butter), but I was very impressed by the combination of flavours in this dish - the light Thai curry sauce gave some welcome chilli notes that offset the succulent, perfectly cooked lobster meat . The half lobster had been beautifully dressed with the intact meat from its claw sitting under the sauce at the top end of the lobster. I ordered a Lobster Thermidor @ \u00a38.95 (half a Canadian 1lb lobster grilled with a light cheese, mustard and Orval beer) \u00a0this was again delicious with the creamy, mustard sauce accompanying the sweet meat perfectly. To accompany our starters we shared a bottle of Chimay Tripel \u00a34.95 and another of Steenbrugge Blonde \u00a34.35. These were excellent recommendations by our waitress, as both had a sweet spiciness, and long yeasty finish which stood up well to the Thai red curry. We also tried the Lobster Bisque @ \u00a34.95 \u00a0this is one of the cleverest dishes on any menu as little if any lobster meat is actually used for its preparation. I make this whenever we eat lobsters at home. The lobster shells are fried in butter and garlic together with a mixture of onion, celery and carrots. The mixture is then transferred to a saucepan while the frying pan is deglazed with white wine. Lobster stock is then added to the saucepan with some herbs, tomato puree, paprika and cream before sieving the soup. Belgo's version was excellent, with a strong lobster flavour, and a richness coming through from the brandy, tomatoes and cream. I could also taste a dash of heat from the paprika which added another layer of complexity to the soup. The bread was deliciously flavoured with caraway seeds. For the main course, Dr G had a Grilled whole lobster with frites @ \u00a317.95. The lobster had been halved and topped with garlic and Pernod butter. The aniseed flavour of the Pernod butter worked well with the sweetness of the lobster meat and garlic; the lobster was sizeable and very good value at \u00a317.95. I opted for Whole surf and turf @ \u00a324.95 \u00a0a whole grilled lobster with garlic and Pernod butter served with a 60z sirloin steak and frites. The flavours were distinct and simple but combined very well together. The double-fried chips were the perfect accompaniment to both dishes \u00a0they were very hot and deliciously crispy. To match our main courses, we had a bottle of blond ale Tripel Karmeliet \u00a34.95 and an amber beer called Pauwel Kwak \u00a34.95. These were again recommended by our waitress to accompany the more robust main dishes and I felt they matched our choices well. Dark orange in colour, they both had a good balance of hops and malt, and a sweet, fruity nose. The dessert menu had quite a few choices varying from \u00a34.75 to \u00a35.25. I ordered a Hazelnut ice cream with Chantilly and toffee apple sauce @ \u00a34.75 which had an intense nutty flavour but",

    "text": "Visited this place on a whim on a Friday night with my CB. We were curious about the good reviews, we love Belgian beers/framboise and were in the area so we decided to check it out. Location! minutes away from Covent Garden tube station and the main hub so it is easy to locate. The entrance is somewhat deceiving as it looks like a club from the outside, the sign is subtle and the dining area is not visible and but you can smell the mouth watering food being prepared somewhere. As we approach the hostess, we were worried because there was a group in front of us waiting to be seated but likely this place is easy in accommodating 2 people so off we go. I heard it is important to make reservation for big group so be aware.Anyhow, we journeyed to the dinning area which is really interesting as it is underground. It totally reminded me of Hawksmoar restaurant down the street. The decor is pretty minimalistic but cool. The service was quick and food was good. I had the beef carbonade and CB had the traditional mussels and frittes. Both dishes were tasty although my carbonade was on the heavy side (at least for me). The frittes were nice and crispy while the Floris Apple beer was sweet and smooth. The prices of the food here is pretty reasonable but the beer as it is imported from Belgium is a big expensive. Good news to the Delirium Tremens beer drinker as you will find you such here. Verdict: Good Atmosphere, quick service and pretty good food.",

    "text": "This was not my first visit to Belgo's... but it might possibly be my last. It's a great place to go with friends and have a loud evening out, drinking fruit beers and eating mussels. On this occasion, I was sat next to such a group, which isn't half as pleasant. But ambience isn't a deal-breaker for me. I'm all about the food.Before we get to the food, I must say, one of the best things about Belgo's is there extensive \"Beer Bible\" - each one as delicious as the next, if I do go back anytime soon, it would be to check off some more of these beers. We got the classic mussels and the poppei - mussels baked with cheese and pancetta, and some sort of green pesto. I've had both of these before, and they were well executed, but this time, it saddens me to say, they were far below expectations. Now granted Sunday night before a bank holiday Monday is definitely not the quietest of times and they probably rushed through thousands of orders that night, so in part, I am to blame...kinda. But the mussels were overcooked, the chips were dry, the sauce with the poppei was just tame and awkward, I couldn't find any pancetta if my life depended on it. It's disappointing because I've had better at Belgo's.With hindsight, I think I'd like to give you another chance Belgo's, and I think I will, I'll just be mindful of when I visit...",

They often also provide good value for money, because a lot of the overheads and running costs are cetralised... leaving a little more for lunch deals etc.I feel that Belgo is a good case for this.I prefer Belgo Noord.

    "text": "We were in the Covent Garden area and saw that our tour book recommended Belgo as a fun stop to eat with great food. \u00a0We navigate the cobblestones streets to come to an industrial warehouse interior. The entrance was very unique and we didn't know what to expect as we did not see any tables or patrons, only a hostess standing on an illuminated walkway. \u00a0We were ushered down stairs into a large and boisterous dark communal beer hall, filled with happy diners and knew that this was a good decision! The atmosphere was casual and quite loud, but we could tell that everyone was having a good time.My husband was very excited with the beer selection. He liked that they also came out in the proper glasses, which is not of the norm in the states. \u00a0I was equally excited about the variety of mussels. I've never seen so many ways to prepare this dish! I had a hard time deciding on which dish to try.I decided on the moules bowl- the Snob (I did not stand up and shout \"I'm a SNOB\" as the menu dared me too) The broth was a very rich and creamy base, you could really taste the lobster. I thought it was a little too much for my palette but it did say 'rich' on the menu! it made it hard to finish my heaping bowl of mussels, I'm glad we ordered the mixed breads to sop up the brothy goodness, which probably contributed to me filling up so quickly. He had the roast Tomato, chorizo and Herb Rottiserie chicken and was quick happy with it. The frites were very delightful.We didn't get to sit in the restaurant side of the Belgo, but we did see the servers dressed as monks, running around the kitchen. All in all, I enjoyed our meal here. It was a good recommendation from our tour guide.",

A big bonus is that the waiting staff all dress up in these horrible Belgian robes so you're guaranteed to not be the worst looking person in there :)Food wise, Belgo specialise in moules et frites, but as a vegetarian I had to stay away from the former. The choice of food for veggies is limited, with only 2 main course options on the standard menu. Very disappointing.There are a few more starter options, and we tried the white onion soup and the gruyere croquettes. Both were ok but not hugely inspiring.Julia had the seabass (see pics) which was apparently delicious. I had their summer tart, which was goats cheese, onion, rocket etc and it was pretty tasty (again, see pics).I'm sure that if I'd been a moules-eating man it would have been awesome, but I'm not so it wasn't.It was good, but not as good as Brouge!",

    "text": "Meh. I went with a friend and we each ordered a kilo pot of mussels with a side of chips. How were the chips? Frozen. Most likely, frozen. There was nothing special about them.The mussels at least tasted fresh, but A) there were a large number in my pot that didn't open and therefore wasted, and B) they have four different types of sauces the mussels are made in, but because the pot is tall and deep, you can't really get to the delicious sauce without either eating half the mussels or dumping half of them out. I wish they were served in a shorter, wider plate so you could actually taste the difference. My friend and I each got different \"flavours\" of mussels but the difference wasn't clear until about midway through. As for the atmosphere, I cannot figure out why half the staff is wearing monk-like costumes. Or why half the place is in a well-lit room and the other half (the room we were in) is dark and dungeon-like - complete with low ceilings. My not-very-tall friend found herself ducking to enter the room, which was a first for her. Not sure I'd go back, unless it was during a beat-the-clock special (from Monday-Friday, 5pm-6:30pm, you can get half a kilo pot of mussels and you're charged for whatever time you order them - so, order at 5:30, pay 5.30). I was surprised by how crowded the place was when we arrived, but when we left we were the only ones in the room. Food arrives very quickly; here seems to be a fast turnover.",

The mussels and beer never disappoint you. You get around 7 favours of mussels and yummy beer. Is a bit noisy but relaxing to say, last time I went, I was with a business delegation who were desperate not to talk about business, so down the beer and we start bitching about the boss. The financial controller was determined and start counting how many mussels are there in a pot. So it is 72 (not some statistics Belgo will give you or know)There was a the beer o'clock that runs to 6-ish, now it stops some ridiculous time, but it was nevertheless good valueOk the negative. I hate flies, I hate anything that flies. If I see even a beer fly I need to kill it before I stop thinking about it. Problem with Belgo is their wall is full of beer fly. The light is dimmed, so the person facing to the wall can't see, but if you are sitting next to the wall, the constant beer flies above my head and near me made me so ill that I need to get out of the place as soon as possible. So if they can get the beer flies out of the place I'll give them the 1 star that is lacking (don't worry, the beer flies don't fly into your food, they just irritates me)The other star goes to this cheap eats still cost me \u00a320 per head.",

But friends opted for chicken, which were really good. The mussels are obviously the speciality here, and they looked delicious.

My friend was in town, and we went to Covent Garden. After deciding we were ready to eat, I convinced him to check out the menu as I really wanted some mussels and chips. He's not the biggest fan of mussels, so I was concerned, but he found something on the menu so we went in.The decor is strange. My friend has been to Belgium, so I asked if they decorated places in the slightly strangely rustic/industrial way that Belgo Centraal was decorated. The answer was no, but I still didn't mind how it was set up. I went for the tradionelle and he had what basically equated to bangers and mash (hey, he's in the UK, why not bangers and mash, even if it's at a Belgian restaurant?). We ordered the bread and the croquettes.Well the croquettes came out, and I was expecting something potatoey like most croquettes are. These were small nuggets of fried cheese goodness. Seriously tasty. The mussels came out and looked amazing. The bangers and mash were also quite tasty looking. The mussels were hot and succulent. Seriously. Perfectly cooked and delicious. The garlic/wine sauce wasn't overpowering, but just enough to add a nice flavor to the mussels. I even convinced my friend to try them, and he may be a mussel convert. The chips were nothing special, but they weren't terrible. I'd definitely go back and try the varieties of mussels. So many choices, so many mussels! I felt a bit bloated after eating so many, but I just couldn't stop!",

The owners have succeeded in creating a belgium beer hall equivalent by making it a very 'rough on the edges' restuarant. IF you go to Belgo's the standard dish is the mussels which are to die for. YOu are spoilt for choice on the beer front. Try some of the fruity beers and you will not be disappointed. Another good dishes are the steak and the lamb. Deserts here are also well done, the chocolate cake especially. THis is a fairly standardly priced place well worth the visit!!",

Very average moules and a pushy attitude from the staff (who had clearly been instructed to put turnover in front of basic courtesy). I might accept this kind of behaviour from a service station or a fast food chain, but not a \u00a330 per head establishment, I'm afraid.",

    "text": "An invitation to join a crowd to eat at Belgo Centraal is not an invitation I am likely to turn down. I love Belgian food, drink and culture and even went there for a holiday this summer, fitting in Rock Werchter festival and a trip to Stella Artios brewery in Levuen during my trip. So when I find out that this invitation was a chance to sample the limited edition Oktoberfest menu where each course is served with a beer to compliment and we would have Sam (a beeroligist) at the table explaining the local nuisances and specialist styles and brewing techniques of Belgian beer I made sure I was there early, with bells on! I don't think the bierloigst is there for everyone to talk about beer and the brewing process, but lets see what I can pass on in relation to the menu and the biers available here at Belgo. Before eating, I went for my favourite style of beer, wich is unique to Belgium, a cherry lambic called Kriek. It was yummy and Belgo, who also run Bierodrome, have a huge selcetion of local Begian beers on drafts to choose from. So let me review my eating expereince of the Oktoberfeast available this month af Belgo. My starter - Parfait de volaille (Chicken liver)with a raspberry beer chutney and salad leaves. I would not usually choose liver, pate or such products but given the beer chutney I thought I would take a risk on the basis that, I, had never found De Konnick to be suitable to my tastes when drinking it before. However, this was the moment. It was perfect, a beautiful combination of flavours and despite my usual aversion to both liver and De Konnick, which Sam told us was so named to mean 'The King's Beer', I felt like a King with another combination of dislikes I love together. It instantly joined Jamieson whiskey and ginger ale in this unique club of mine. The other diners were satisfied with a wonderful beer I have tried before called Vedett Extra blond which hit the spot with Aparagus a brugsthat is around eight asparagas shoots in Brugs beer and chieve sauce to you an me. I wanted it really, but eating outside of the comfort zone is needed from time to time. The Main - Panse De Porc, Pork belly cooked in Brugs witbier served with spinach & butternut squash and a Rodenbach Grande-Cru cream sauce Well, a trip to Belgo means Mussells, chips, mayo and Kriek for me. So, time to turn down the moule and try something new. I knew anyone asking for the Moules Blanche on this menu would be happy, although cooking them with bacon, white beer and serving with Affigem Blonde was a new twist on me. There was another dish poking its beady eye out at me and this was called Flamande. I have not had one of these in the UK, but one I had in Lille was possibly one of the best winter dishes I have ever had in my life, even though it was May at that time. Sorry mumit beats the Cottage Pie and the stews you used to do. Sam tells us that the beer this is paired with is rather cider like and I can see that being a winner. In fact, I would go back and have that main course, because my choice was exactly what I wanted and satisifed me perfectly. The Pork belly was perfectly combined with the sauce, the butternut squash and spinach and as for the beerit was the best foriegn dark beer I have had in a while. So full of flavour and a complex texture it was ideal alone, but better with the dish. I am a fan of the Rodenbach Grand-Cru now. Dessert - Leffe Beer Ice Cream served with syrup de liege and pralines Oh, surprise, surprise, beer with everythingI bravly chose the Leffe ice cream hoping it wasn't dark Leffe, but found it was the blonde and it was much better than I could have imagined. The crunchy syrup de liege was nice to suck upon in the ice cold mouth and it rounded a wonderful evening of cooking with beer that Micheal Jackson would have been proud of. In fact I have a couple of Leffe drinking buddies who would enjoy this dish alone. It was however the craft of the Poire Pochee, a pear poached in cherry beer served with a peach beer sorbet which caught my eye for a later date. All of this washed down with another favourite of theduckFruli! They couldn't go wrong with me could they???? And for your eyesthe line up for Oktoberfeast in full OKTOBERFEAST Choose from the following menu and sample 3 specially selected Belgian beers for only \u00a327.50 per person* (\u00a319.95 for the menu without beer). *minimum of 2 people, maximum 10 per table Starters Asperges a la Brugswith a Brugs white beer & chive sauce Beer pairing \u00a0Vedett Extra Blond Parfait de volailleWith a raspberry beer chutney Beer pairing - DeKoninck Croquettes de FromageBelgian cheese croquettes made with Orval trappist beer Beer pairing - Orval Main Courses Panse De PorcPork belly cooked in Brugs witbier served with spinach & butternut squash and a Rodenbach Grande-Cru cream sauce Beer pairing - Rodenbach Grand-Cru Carbonnade FlamandeBraised beef cooked in Faro beer, nutmeg and brown sugar Beer pairing - Mort Subite Gueuze Bouchee aux Champignons SauvageA",

After discovering the joys of mussels aged 9 (I previously cowered away from them into some chicken dish or other) I always order the same dish: a kilo pot of mussels in a white wine and garlic sauce with a side order of fries. The food takes just a bit too long too arrive, but when eating seafood I am always willing to allow for it to be cooked to perfection. The mussels are tasty, big and orange, but there are always a few unopened mussels left over, which, in desperation, I try to prise open. The chips are brilliant when ordered Belgian style - the staff will gladly bring pots of mayonnaise for your enjoyment. I become something of a glutton at this restaurant, scooping up the mussel sauce with empty shells to sip at it, despite it humming with garlic. For a quick meal, this is great, although the industrial ambience, which was once very progressive (unisex toilets?!) and exciting, is now a bit brutal. There is no sound but the clattering and the crashing of the kitchen, loud guffawing from nearby tables of fat men trying out obscure beers, and the heat becomes somewhat menacing.",

It is not really belgium food although they claimed that it is Belgium food restaurant. Even though the food taste alright, it is over-priced. Definitely not worth th trip to Belgo and I would rather spend the money somewhere else. The last time I went, we spent about \u00a340 per person including drinks and the food was not great at all. It was also too crowded and the service was not good as the were short of staffs.",

They now take deposits for Kwak as people were stealing the glasses - so that's a shame. They also do a large selection of flavoured vodka if beer isn't your thing.",

My first Belgium food experience was also at this restaurant and my first impression was a great one, I remembered stuffing myself with some good steak. The place is often crowded and sometimes have to wait for a while for our table. Service was great, once it was our turn, they showed us to our table and paid attention to us (positively), making us feel comfortable and often ask us whether were were satisfied and anything else they could get us. Thumbs up for this service! The interior of the restaurant makes it feel like being in an underground or something but I thought its pretty present, only thing is it can get very noisy when its full. Lots of diners chatting at almost the same time is not very pleasant for our ears. However, the food made up for it!",

The staff were really friendly and made lots of good recommendations for beer, which was great as I'm more of a wine girl, but you can't go to a place that serves over 100 different types of beer and get a glass of claret. I had the mussels in a tomato sauce, which was delicious. My companions both cleared their respective plates, so I'm guessing their food was sufficiently tasty. This review is slacking in detail because, in all honesty, we all got absolutely smashed and I don't remember a whole lot. There are photos on my phone of me crouching down in an abandoned suitcase in the street, so you know it was a good night. However, I do remember thinking that this place was the dog's cojones.",

Soggy, not crisp and not terribly tasty. \u00a0Having remembered this place after having been impressed by Belgo in my late 20s, I can say that either my tastes have improved or things are rotten in the state of Denmark, and Belgium too, if judging by the frites.I can see what I did like about the place though --a festive cavernous dungeon-like beer garden setting, almost like a nightclub, loud music, fun beer hall vibe, decent mussels options, etc. \u00a0However, not such very desirable frites, sadly. \u00a0BTW, we had a terrible service experience, which is, no doubt, coloring my opinion. \u00a0(Although the frites were still a failure, regardless.) We were seated by a nice hostess, then told brusquely three minutes later by a bullying floor manager, that we should have known better than to seat ourselves in a four-top as a family of three when they have many other guests waiting for a table for four. \u00a0Huh? \u00a0When got our footing, we pointed out that a Belgo hostess sat us here and we were just following orders. \u00a0Then did the floor manager apologize or try charm us for her error? \u00a0Nah, as you might expect she simply ignored the comment altogether and continued to insist we move to a shared tight seating situation with another party, on a fairly small table. \u00a0While I don't mind communal seating, hitting elbows and plates and possibly jaws with the neighbors isn't my favorite way to eat --the table turned out to be unusually close quarters for a family and another couple on a date. \u00a0All the while, the floor manager maintained the same annoyed fashion, that we were in the wrong, throughout. Meanwhile, the table we were booted from remained empty for almost our entire meal \u00a0--over an hour. \u00a0Later, we did have the original hostess come back and offer a round of snapps and an eye roll about her colleague's attitude, but at that point, we were pretty deflated.",

The white wine sauce the mussels were prepared with was absolutely delicious. I ended up putting the fries into the sauce and allowing them to soak about the sauce.I also ordered a pint of Belgo Pils which was an appropriate compliment to mussels. Belgo Centraal also has an extensive selection of Belgian beers. The menu recommends trying the Bruges Zot Brune (a dark ale) which I intend on trying next time; I was unsure if the dark ale was going to overpower the mussels, so I played it cautiously.The restaurant is underground and the restaurant is furnished to provide an ambiance that matches the location. Additionally, the waitstaff was attentive and because I ordered a common dish it was ready fairly quickly.",

When I look back on the various types of cuisine I ate in London, it reinforces the facts that it is a city with a diverse food culture and that, if you do your homework, you can find inexpensive dining options.The first thing you notice about Belgo is the building itself. You enter the building and take an elevator down a level where it feels as if youve been transported to the cellar of a Belgian monastery. It's dark, somewhat cave-like, and many of the servers are dressed like monks. As far as the food goes, we went there specifically for the \"Beat the Clock\" special which I believe runs between 5pm-7pm. The price of your meal is based on when you arrive--the earlier the better. One of the Beat the Clock meal combinations was mussels and fries. They were excellent. To get food of that quality for that price was really quite a treat in such an otherwise expensive city. Im not a beer drinker, but they claim to have over 80 Beligian beers... So I asked for a recommendation and tried one. Im not sure what it was, but it was tasty and expensive (more than my meal, by far). If you visit, though, Id definite partake in some Belgian beer just for the sake of the experience, if nothing else.Pros: Excellent atmosphere, interior design, Beat the Clock special, great food, vast beer selection, location in the Covent Garden areaCons: Expensive when not taking advantage of the Beat the Clock special",

With the garlic and white wine sauce, they should be bursting with flavour. And what's with the frites? I only got about 3 and, as Steve B pointed out, they appeared to be of the frozen oven-chips variety.The second time I had the crab and lobster burger and it left a lot to be desired for me. It was tasteless mush. Again, how on earth do you make crab and lobster taste so... nothing! There really must be an art to it.

I remembered it last Friday night after we'd been out for some drinks and it was raining and all of Soho was full up. \"There's the mussels place in Seven Dials.\" I said. My husband looked at me like I'd just made the idea up. \"It's in the basement of a building. Trust me.\" So we went. And it was so so so good.Did I realize it was going to be cafeteria style? Nope. Did I care? Nope. We were seated at a big table with another couple who arrived about the same time. Lobster bisque = amazing. Crab cakes = divine. Roast chicken = tasty. Moules traditionelle = yummmmy. AND they carry Lindemann's lambics (& other fruity booze) Those things are so hard to find. I'll be going back just for the fruity stuff, but am looking forward to trying the \"snobby\" mussels in bisque. Mmmmm.",

    "text": "My wife found out about Belgo Centraal and suggested we went along after struggling to find somewhere to eat on a Friday night without a long wait. I went in knowing very little, but left with an urge to hurry back!When I heard the terms \"Belgian mussels restaurant\" I had imagined a small, quiet place where we would be served a handful of mussels for an extravagant amount of money. I was pretty much wrong on all accounts.First of all - Belgo is a massive place. Endless rows of bench seating, a back room (which had a big party going on; a birthday or Stag night I assumed), and the longest kitchen/counter I have ever seen. I like being able to see the kitchen, and you couldn't miss this one, with scores of chefs and servers managing pots and pots of steaming delicious mussels. Belgo takes up an underground floor which must be a good portion of the full length of Earlham Street, and had that \"undergound\" feel with exposed piping, brickwork, and low ceiling arches. I like this look.First choice I had of course was ordering a drink. I didn't expect such a range of Belgian beer options, so it took quite a while to decide. I opted for a less-familiar lager; though many house names are available from the extensive drinks menu. Then onto the food - again a superb choice and not all mussels-centric. Of course, it makes up a significant portion of the menu, but given the choice of moules pots, bowls, and platters, this is no bad thing. I opted for the \"Traditionelle\" kilo pot - standard white wine, garlic, and celery - and a kilo is a LOT of mussels for under \u00a313! I struggled to finish them after a light crab cake starter. My wife went for one of non-moules options; there was a decent choice here too, and was impressed with her starter of lobster bisque; and the rotisserie chicken main was good if not amazing. Given how tasty that bisque was, I wished I had ordered my mussels in a creamier sauce, but that was my choice and I do not regret it. It was a tasty introduction to mussels done properly!The waiting staff were very quick and friendly; especially commendable given how busy the place was. Also, despite this being a very busy time, we were never rushed and were allowed to take in the scene and the delicious Belgian fare.I will definitely be returning in the not-too-distant future to sample some richer cuisine and rarer beverages!",

    "text": "Belgos is a hit an miss place most of the time. The only redeeming factor is that they serve Strawberry Fruli. In my younger days (before Yelp) I only knew of this place and Porterhouse in Covent Garden serving this beer. Now I know better! De Hems does it, I think the Slug and Lettuce had it on Lisle Street too! Plus, now there is Rekorderlig which is basically the same thing you can buy from supermarkets/get from most bars/pubs! No more need to feel bound to Belgos just to get a drink!THE PROS- Strawberry Fruli on tap, other Fruli flavours on bottles- Mussels, mussels and more mussels. Seafood offers. Loyalty cards. Beat the clock offers (pay the time you order the food before 630 I think?)THE CONS- Sometimes food is waiting at the front of the kitchen so long it becomes cold when it arrives. I once ordered a steak which was COLD when I got it.- Some mussels (like the garlic butter one - which is basically replacing French snails l'escagot with mussels) are super small for the price you are paying, it's almost not worth it.- The place is always packed. Most of the time it is also packed with big groups of loud and rowdy people.- Our order literally took over 1 hour to arrive. We were a group of 18 or so people. Really? Most of us ordered mussels! You just put different sauce in! - However, the manager agreed with our complaint and took off the price of starters (but only a few people ordered starters)",

But my goat cheese salad was small, didn't have the roast tomatoes announced in the menu, the 'croutons' where 3 small pieces of chewy baguette... don't know, at \u00a39.00 with apple juice plus service, I think it's better to go to Food for Thought nearby. Also, I wanted to try the mussels, but either you order them with fries (which I wasn't going to eat) or you order a huge amount for more than \u00a311, that it's good for sharing but not for myself. I don't know, they should have the option of ordering them alone, but I guess everybody loves fries...",

They loved it. The men thoroughly enjoyed the wide selection of beers, and the servers were great at making recommendations for them. As always, the mussels are good. My favorite is the Green Thai mussel pot, but I've also had the Mariana (garlic, white wine, cream) which is good but could be a bit more flavorful, as well as the Florentine (which is good but a bit too rich for my taste).The staff dresses in monk's robes to go with the whole Belgian monastery-brewery theme, and the entire left side of their alcohol menu has monastically-brewed beers.They also have a kid's menu, which makes it family friendly.I recommend making a reservation so you don't have to wait.",

I had a Blanche De Bruxelles. It was extremely cold (sometimes had to find in England, from my experiences) light and crisp. Delicious. Theie were frites everywhere. I ordered the fried Haddock and it was AWESOME. My husband had some kind of roast chicken dish and he claimed it was the best that he ever had. Strangley, when we got there around 9:30pm, they notified us they were out of mussels which was supposed to be one of their specialities. Oh well. The seating is picnic table/communal and the servers are dressed as monks. The bathrooms are strange as both sexes share sinks. Give it a whirl if you're in the covent garden area. Very noisy, but lots of fun.",

Receive a bowl of crispy delicious frites and steaming mussels in a delicious both5. Savor, eat, drink6. Pay for what you get, at the time your ordered....5pm = 5 quid! Best deal in Londontown.And while it's not so cheap during the weekend (around 12 quid) you can get a bigger bowl (i think it's acutally a cauldron) of other varieties of mussels, that are a lot bigger and arguably more delicioius.

A rather intriguing choice of fruit beers, dark beers, light beers and ales, for those thirsty for that bloaty goodness. However this is a strange place, that I struggle to make my mind upon. The choice of food is average: moules frites; steak; bangers and mash, but there are about ten different variations on the muscles, and you can even get a personal favourite of mine, the wild boar sausage. What's strange about the food though is the main focus on the plate will have been cooked with a lot of care and consideration, where as the trimmings are a little bit lifeless. This seems to be a resounding theme throughout Belgo's, and this is why I struggle to make my decision. Yes it is somewhat exciting at first, but the layout is a little clunky, and you kind of feel that you're in a somewhat upmarket school diner.I would probably recommend Belgo's to a very specific type of person, perhaps someone who's more up for \"sh**s and giggles\" rather than a true dining experience. Belgo's has become quite popular in recent years, and I would have to point out to you that you may need to make a reservation first.",

I tried the chorizo mussels and the pot would have been big enough to share, they just lacked flavor.

Come here if you want a casual fun dinner! (...that kind of sounded like an advertisement, but I swear it's not)The moules are always fresh and perfectly cooked.

    "text": "My friend had his birthday dinner here last weekend, though I'd never heard of it before despite its central location in Seven Dials. They also have 3 more locations around London, and once inside you realize that the restaurant is enormous. Apparently they have their own beer supplier in Belgium that brews their house Belgo Wit and Belgo Pils. I had a few pints of the Belgo Wit and found it light, pleasant and easy to drink. I was however very disappointed that these were 2 of the 3 beers that they had on tap, and the rest were all bottled. We were seated downstairs in a cave-like room past the beer hall, which comfortably fit 25-30 people. I can see why this place would be really great for parties. Even though Belgium isn't known for a beer hall culture, they had a large beer hall section with tables of 8-10, and where I heard reports of people dancing on tables for a brief period of time (I don't think that is particularly normal). As for the food, we had a few of the giant planks, which included cheese, crudit\u00e9s, cured meats, and some chutneys. We then ordered individually and to my surprise, the rotisserie and the burgers were quite popular choices among our group. I didn't consider any menu option besides mussels and ended up getting the Snob, which is served in lobster bisque. I thought the mussels were high quality, decently sized and very clean, and it was more than enough to eat. They also came served with pretty good fries, but I thought it was disappointing that they didn't give us each our own mayonnaise and ketchup, and instead we had to share a small dish of each amongst 2-3 people. Another nice thing would have been bread to eat with the broth of the mussels, but that had to be ordered separately. One of my friends managed to make quite a mess eating the mussels, so perhaps they should consider providing bibs...Overall I think this is a great casual restaurant for large groups. I don't think I'm in any rush to come back for the food, but if you are into your Belgian beers, this is a good bet.",

My friend that I was traveling with had found this place on Trip Advisor (I am usually skeptical about that site), but I was pleasantly surprised. Covent Garden was short ride on the tube, it was a fun little area, cobblestone streets, pubs, clothing stores, etc. We couldn't decide on which moules, so we ordered two kilo pots (way too much food for two people) we ordered the Traditionelle (white wine, celery, garlic and onion) and the Thai (lemongrass, chili, ginger, kaffir lime, coconut and coriander). I preferred the Traditionelle as I thought the flavor was fantastic. The moules were excellent, big and juicy and fresh. We ordered bread so we could dip it into the pots (highly recommend soaking the sauce up with the bread). Lots of beer to choose from, I had a couple rounds of Mongozo coconut beer, which was so flavorful (not a lot of alcohol tho).",

We were blessed with a waitress (I believe her name was Roxanne?) who was highly knowledgeable on the international beer selection available at the restaurant. She impressed us so much with her knowledge of ingredients, brewing techniques, and history that we relinquished control and allowed her to choose all of our drinks. Thanks to her infinite wisdom, I was able to try delicious beers that I probably would have overlooked.Good friends plus good drinks equals a great time. Thank you, Roxanne... or whatever your name is!",

The beer menu on the tables a definite plus, and the beers actually being served in the matching glasses, a thoughtful and appreciated touch. Whilst I would definitely recommend Belgo's to beer appreciators, I did have a few issues with the service. To start I ordered a blonde zot but received the dark and the table next to us also received the wrong side orders. When I asked the waitress to change my beer as per my order, she took the beer off the table, didn't apologise, \u00a0and was in no hurry to bring me my replacement. I am quite patient and I completely understand waiting for service when the waiter/ress is having to serve several tables but having been given menu's to start and then for dessert, we found ourselves waiting some time for the waitress to return to take our order, even though she was standing at the side of the room gazing into the distance whilst we waved our menus.On to the taste - I had the mussels provencale, now I am a mahoo-sive garlic fan, but for me there just wasn't much flavour. The Belgian waffle on the other hand was gorgeous and the chocolate sorbet divine!Whilst I have highlighted a few negatives, I would still recommend Belgo's and will probably return again, just hoping for a bit more attentive service next time.",

They have some tasty appetizers - my favorites being the grilled goat cheese with roasted peppers and sundried tomatos and the three cheese croquettes. Obviously I would recommend ordering mussells here (when in Belgium...) but I've tried some of their other entrees which are also quite good - specifically the beef carbonade and the haddock. Mmmmm.

Somehow they tread that fine line of making it feel traditional, with long beer hall tables and an open kitchen, and funky, using modern materials and designs. Which is the exact vibe I got when travelling in Belgium and I thought very well done! (total aside, but the bathrooms were very cool, with metal sheeting for doors and a unisex water fountain instead of basins) The beer menu is BIG. I thought I like most beer but realised here that there are some beers I definitely like more than others! The beerologist also helped, giving guidance on what will be good to start the evening and expanding on why certain beers go well with certain foods, where they come from and the history and process behind making them. It was very interesting and gave me new insight into the world of beer! The food was delicious. Not the cheapest menu I've seen, but not exorbitant. I had the pork belly and it was excellent \u00a0tasty and well prepared but not overly Germanic and heavy. The accompanying grand cru beer was an experience (that I would rather not repeat) but went perfectly with the food. The cheese croquettes to start sat well with the Oval trappist beer (these are made in working monasteries, although the monks are only allowed to sample the fruits of their labour once a week) and the strawberry blonde made my poached pear desert even sweeter (which I loved!).I really thought the food was excellent and the environment made it a very jovial meal.

Just a couple of minutes walk from Covent Garden tube station Belgo's has a huge beer selection of varying strengths from 2.5% to a mind-blowing 12% on their own menu. They have around 6 draft beers, usually Belgian, and more styles of bottled beer than many places have bottled beers: white beers, fruit beers, 'triple' fermented, Saison, Lambic, Trappist, wine beers, Pilsner, Flemish brown ales, amber beers, golden ales, blonde ales, double dark biers! Plus of course wine, champagne and spirits including Genevers (Dutch Gin) and schnapps. If the beer menu doesn't get you then the food menu includes Mussels (Thai curry, Mariniere, Provencale, Classique, curry); rotisserie chicken, salmon, haddock, wild boar and Chimay beer sausages, steak and occasionally lobster to name a few. The seating area is unusual, long strips of tables make dining rather less formal and certainly not a place to go for an intimate meal, but great fun nonetheless. Beware! I'm not the only one who likes the place, and if you don't book a table you can end up handing around for a while waiting for a table. There is a small upstairs bar area whilst you wait, but that is usually packed too, so be warned.",

Beer was great: lots of choice and all good quality. Service was just ok, a tiny bit rushed as the place is very very popular. All in all, definitely worth a look.",

    "text": "Part of a three part chain, Belgo can sometimes be a bit of a hit or miss experience depending on who serves you. Belgo's offers Belgian food and beer in cavernous atmosphere underground with several signs warning tall people to mind their heads at particular intersections. During the week, they have an amazing beat the clock deal where you pay whatever the time is if you order between, I think, 5 and 6pm. A bargain if you can nip away from work early enough (and you're hungry enough). At lunch they offer another deal where you can order a beer (half pint), or a glass of wine or and a dish from the lunch menu and pay under \u00a36 with the exception of a few dishes that are an additional quid or two more. A bargain considering how big some of the dishes are! Like most Belgian Beer bars, their selection is massive and they even offer a sampling plank with small glasses of many different types of beer that will undoubtedly leave you feeling tipsy.",

    "text": "Belgo Centraal is a huge underground restaurant in Covent Garden. Book in advance if you can - we didn't and had to wait about half an hour for a table (which isn't unreasonable, especially at the weekend). You enter the restaurant at street level, where there is a bar for pre-dinner drinks. More a standing-room-only bar -- you're in a cage! -- there is a wide range of beers as well as other drinks available. When your table is ready you'll be taken downstairs to the huge cellar that must run under three or four of the neighbouring buildings. There is a large theatre kitchen in the central section allowing you to see what the chefs are getting up to. Tables are arranged in rows school-dinner fashion so you might end up sharing with other parties, but this adds to the relaxed and informal atmosphere of the restaurant. The menu offers a wide selection of Belgian dishes, of course with the obligatory mussels! The food was of high standard and was efficiently served. The waiting-on staff were also friendly and helpful, although they did wander off with my credit card for a while A great restaurant that I would return to when I'm visiting friends in London.",

    "text": "This is one of the few yelp recommendations which have disappointed me ... and i really don't know why.Its been more than 1.5 years since my last visit to Brussels, and hence my last taste of Belgian food. So i dropped in there this saturday night. It was crowded, but since i was alone, i easily got a table.The decor of the place is unique. Reminds you more of an acid factory, or the Matrix machine city, rather than a restaurant. You have steel pipes everywhere (i would like to find out whether all these are merely decorations or was there some kind of factory in that location earlier) and that, along smoke from the kitchen, gives you an eerie feeling.The service was prompt and friendly. The guy who led me from the staircase (the seating area is a floor below ground level) to the table actually chatted with me ... a rarity in London.This restaurant has a 3 page belgian beer menu ... ranging from those with 0.5% alcohol to those with 12%. You will surely find something that will suit your taste.I ordered a kwak ( abelgian beer brand), and a mussel and crab soup as starter.The soup was served within 3-4 minutes. This place is surely using some 6 sigma technique or something. The service was lightning fast.I actually heard the \"kwak\" of the kwak for the first time ... made me feel good.My main course was wild boar sausages with some belgian mash. Liked the main dish but not the sauce that came along with it. In fact, i didn't seem to enjoy the food very much. The soup was reasonably good though. There is no specific fault that i can find with the food, but it just didn't feel great.The whole dinner was surprisingly short ... in and out within 45 minutes.",

The mussels are big unless some restaurants where you are struggling to find one! If you don't like mussels then there you can order chicken, steak etc. Caters for most people. During the week, it does an offer whereby the price of your meal is on the time you order. E.g I ordered my meal at 5.45 and that was the cost of my meal - with that you get a beer or a soft drink - worth doing! The atmosphere is very vibrant and if you pre book you will be seated in the area that is more of a restaurant area rather than a wagamana style seating. The staff are friendly though during busy periods you can wait for a while to be seated, but they do have a bar, which I must add, is a tad small!!",

It's like the smallest something was missing that I just can't put my finger on.We got frites as the side for both orders of mussels. And why wouldn't you? They are really, really, really good. Crispy and flavorful, they hit the spot. Second only in London to FlatIron I would say.The restaurant itself is massive yet inviting. It's a really cool setting. The rock music is a little loud, but it works.They gave my son a free ice cream cone at the end which I really appreciated and which was super nice of them.

The food was under seasoned, if it wasn't for the sweat dripping from my pores onto my plate, I think it would have been a below sub par type of meal.

Cons: tired decor, French fries were average at best (lukewarm and not crisp), which is a bit of a crime for a Belgian restaurant, and less than stellar service (slow, inattentive, & unfriendly). We had to request spoons, which should be a given when serving mussels in broth. Also, the bread is soft instead of toasted or hard crust baguette, so when you dip it in the broth, it disintegrates. Overall, it's not terrible, but when you go to London with so many great choices, it doesn't make the grade. I won't be going back.",

Here is a great place to try a variety of beers and one of the few places in London with a good selection of fruit beers. The mussels are served in a good value heap and tasty creamy sauce and the vegetarian starter platter comes with an addictively delicious cheese as well as satisfyingly crunchy carrot sticks and celery. There was also a wonderful live band that night. As such, Belgo can deliver a joyous all-round dining experience.",

    "text": "The was, by far, the worst dining experience my husband and I had during our 2.5 week vacation in the UK. \u00a0There were 2 positives about this place: The mussels were perfectly cooked (tender and without any grittiness) and my husband enjoyed the lobster bisque. \u00a0Now to the negatives:Although the mussels were cooked perfectly, they were utterly flavorless. \u00a0We got two different broths and neither had any flavor. \u00a0We ended up dousing each, individual muscle with lemon and salt to be able to eat them. The fries were just passable.The service, while friendly, was exceptionally SLOW and confused. \u00a0After we were seated, it took a long time for anyone to come to our table to take our food or drink order. \u00a0After ordering, my husband got his soup fairly quick, but we had to wait over an hour for our mussels. We saw 3, yes 3, parties come and go at the table next to us. \u00a0We asked our waiter about our order, but he completely disappeared. \u00a0We finally flagged down another waiter and explained the situation. \u00a0He was actually very nice and managed to get our order to us. \u00a0Apparently, the kitchen never got or order. So, the mussels get to us...the problem: I get the wrong order. \u00a0I ordered the Thai mussels because they were dairy-free. \u00a0But, instead, I got the Provencale. \u00a0The waiter took the mussels back; then, he returned a short time later with the same pot of mussels and the manager. \u00a0She claimed that the kitchen changed my order to the Provencal because the Thai mussels have dairy. \u00a0I pointed out that the menu clearly states that they are dairy-free. \u00a0She said, \"no, they have coconut milk.\" \u00a0I asked if it was plain coconut milk because I know some places mix it with cream. When she said that it was in fact just coconut milk, I told her that coconut milk is NOT dairy. \u00a0She condescendingly told me I was wrong and that all coconut milk has dairy in it. \u00a0How are you the manager of a restaurant and think that coconut milk is dairy?! \u00a0She finally said that she would get my order of Thai mussels. \u00a0At that point, I was pissed, hungry, and my husband's mussels were getting cold. \u00a0So, I told her to just leave the Provencale. \u00a0During that entire exchange, the waiter (the nice one) actually looked embarrassed and ashamed that he worked there. \u00a0In addition to that debacle, our drinks were never refilled, we were never asked if we wanted more wine, and no one ever checked on us. \u00a0When we got our check, which also took an insane amount of time, we were shocked that they didn't take the mussels off of our check. \u00a0We were going to complain, but just wanted to get the hell out of there. \u00a0By the way, we weren't the only ones with issues. \u00a0Of the 3 parties that came and went at the table next to us, 2 had problems. \u00a0One of them \u00a0was charged wrong on their bill. \u00a0They had to argue with the waiter to fix the amount. \u00a0The other was brought the wrong order. \u00a0Between those errors and the ones I dealt, there was not a single apology.The entire dining experience was over 2 hours of MISERY!",

(Mostly because it's in a basement.)While the food here was one of our better meals and actually pretty awesome, the service really knocked down our experience big time. We were seated upon our arrival but the hostess was not very friendly and seemed pretty pretentious.We had a reservation and once we were seated, it took about 15 minutes for someone to come by to greet us and to ask if we wanted anything to drink. In fact, no one came over - my Dad had to go up to someone and ask for them to take our order. It seemed that no one really wanted our table or knew who was assigned.A woman came over to take our order. A while after, a man came over to check on us and to drop off drinks. Our food was delivered by 3 other people. I'm not sure we saw the same person twice. The food was really awesome. I had a steak with bearnaise sauce and fries. It was a really heavy meal but the steak was cooked perfectly, the sauce was perfect and the fries were even good! (I am usually a pasta/rice person and don't really eat many potatoes.) I think this place just needs to lose the attitude and it will be much better.Oh, and try the strawberry beer. Really good.",

The guy serving us seemed to think that the greater the height you poured it from the better it would be... We ended up with massive foamy heads on our beers that would overflow the glass. Not the way it should be done. The beer is exceptionally tasty though!Secondly a couple of us got the mussel platters, and were really disappointed by it, on my platter, they were overcooked, and seemed to be missing the pancetta, the other guy who had the same dish definitely had at least some on his plate. Also the size of the dish compared to the others was disproportionate. Literally got what seemed like half what anybody else ordered.That said, it was a good night, I will go back but I'll be ordering something else and pouring my own beer...",

The lobster's are half price and served with chips and mayonnaise- a marriage made in heaven. It's incredible to watch as the lobster's arrive to the table and a hushed silence suddenly falls. Everyone is concentrating so hard on reaching that last delicious scrap of lobster from its shell that there is no time to socialise. The boys find it a very primal, manly affair. In fact, they regress so much I wouldn't be surprised if one of them asked to keep the carcass as a trophy to warn off other lobster's... During the rest of the year, Belgo's makes an equally fun night out and it's moules frites are unbeatable anywhere in the capital. Being a popular spot for a good feed it can get very busy and I've known it to take 45 minutes to get a table. However, this wait is easily spent sipping one of the many beers they have on offer in the bar upstairs. Really, there is nothing they haven't thought of!",

I have been a fan of Belgo for years and have kept up with my free meal punch card despite the fact that I live in America. I am one punch away for a free meal! I think Belgo has the best value in the city with all of their promotions, the clock-watcher promo, the express lunch, and best of all the food is actually good. Usually a place that offers so many gimmicks and discounts does so because they have no other way to draw in customers. I love the roast chicken and think the frites are some of the best in the world. I have also enjoyed a rabbit dish and had some very good wursts. My mussel eating friends have raved about the freshness of the mussels and I have deigned to dip my bread in the various mussel sauces at the edges of their plates and found it to be very tasty indeed. All of these factors combined with a central, although somewhat hard to initially find location and waitstaff dressed in monks robes and you have a winner on your hands.",

    "text": "Once upon a time, as fairytales often begin, two food & football fans wanted to enjoy a good Belgian meal to celebrate the victory of Belgium during one of the games for the European Football cup (We did say this was a fairytale!). Desperately looking for a decent place in London, our Anglo-Belgian and French-Canadian pioneers found themselves having to make do with a bowl of chips washed down with a Stella Artois. In their quest to honour Belgian cuisine, our two valiant knights decided to launch Belgo, a restaurant dedicated to the perfect national match: beer and food. The place was such a great success that, 12 months later, a few square meters were added to the initial room. A second restaurant, Belgo Centraal, saw the light of day in Covent Garden in 1992. Like in every fairy tale, where miracles allow the wandering prince to find his perfect princess, Belgo's magical recipe was held in three words: Moules, frites et bi\u00e8re; mosselen, frietjes en bier; mussels, chips and beer. Londoners come to enjoy the 73 beers selected from the finest breweries of Belgium and the freshness of the mussels which are consumed at a rate of seven tons a week. Nevertheless, neither enchanted forest nor mysterious creatures welcome you to Belgo and yet the waiters dressed as monks and make it their pleasure to elucidate all the mysteries of beers and Belgian specialties. In a fairy tale, the legends that surround the main story are as important as the plot itself, creating the right atmosphere in which to enjoy the story.The same holds for Belgian beers: When enjoying a glass of Orval trappist beer, you may notice the fish printed on the glass. Legend says that Countess Mathilde was walking next to a lake when her wedding ring fell into the water. Having lost her husband recently, her ring meant a lot to her and she prayed for the ring to be returned to her. A fish suddenly leapt from the water, holding the ring in its mouth. As a gratitude to God, Countess Mathilde decided to build a monastery on the lake's shore As with any successful quest, it is time to celebrate what made Belgo famous: the beer. For the occasion of Oktoberfest (Oct. 1st \u00a031st), and a friendly donation of \u00a327.50, the restaurant will kick off the festifities with a 3-course menu of Belgian specialties, each matched to its own beer. Among the starters, the Shelled mussels in a cream & De Koninck monay sauce with buttered leeks in a puff pastry case, paired with Brugs Wit is a fine introduction to Belgian cuisine with tasty mussels and a delicate sauce. The pastry is light and the portion is ideal for a starter. The Brug Wit is soft and sweet, opening the palate for all the pleasures to come. The crunchy yet creamy soft Belgian cheese croquettes made with Orval trappist beer served with Orval beer melt in the mouth. They are served with well-balanced sweet and sour piccalilli. The Orval beer is quite fruity, and is the ideal match for the tang of the piccalilli. As a main course, my favourite goes to the puff pastry case filled with wild mushrooms in an Orval beer with Truffle cream sauce with asparagus spears and button onions matched with Steenbrugge Blond.The well-rounded fruity hoppy beer cleanses your palate just so with every mouthful to savour the delight of puff pastry perfection, smooth Truffle cream sauce, and crisp asparagus. The braised beef cooked in Faro beer, nutmeg and brown sugar paired with Mort Subite Gueuse is one of the classical Belgian dishes where the slow, 8-hour cooking process allows the meat to absorb all the flavours and release an even sweetness. The sweet and fruity Mort Subite Gueuse beer may have emphasized the sweetness of the dish a bit too much, though, and the portion was truly belgian. As an ode to Belgian chocolate, the Belgian dark chocolate cheesecake on a biscuit base with cherry beer coulis was the perfect choice for dessert. Each morsel is a pure pleasure to the palate, the spicy cherry beer coulis balancing nicely with the delicacy of the chocolate.The paired Fr\u00fcli Strawberry beer was reminiscent of a fruit smoothie with a slightly more bitter taste; a good choice if you're the kind of person who needs a sweet taste after a meal. The Oktoberfest is the perfect example of the definition of Belgian cuisine: In the words of our master waiter, a combination of German portions with French culinary skills. German portions indeed. Make sure to have your stomach ready for a feast!",

This place has excellent mussels, crispy frites, and of course, beer. The menu is worthy being a text for a lesson in Belgian beer-making history. They also offer several flavors of Genever, a fruit liquor almost impossible to find outside of Belgium.Unisex bathroom stalls with a shared sink are a clean adventure, and the price is right. Who could ask for anything more?",

Saturday late night, not too many people inside, so was able to sit immediately.To start off, shared the Dirty Fries (\u00a39) - a mound of well crisped fries topped with cheese sauce, tomato sauce, \"bacconaise\", and pancetta. Not as saucy as the ingredients suggest, yet easy to share and hot off the fryer. For the main course, ordered the Savoury Waffle (\u00a39) - a darkened waffle topped with chilli tomato ragu and a poached egg. Sections off quite nicely and the runny egg is an interesting topping over the dense waffle. Also ordered drinks from the solid list, but can't remember what they were.Cool spot to chill and relax in booths with a group of people. Food is an excellent indulgence if in the mood.",

And I've previously written about the chicken.Instead you pay \u00a328 for a smaller lobster than you can get at Big Easy for \u00a320.But wait! They have a special lobster festival menu, where you can order a SMALLER one for \u00a335 that's a whole lobster that somehow has no claws! And is closer to the size of a crawfish.And when you query it and you have the regular lobster and the special side by side on the same table they will somehow find a way to insist that it is indeed a whole lobster. That's right. This more expensive and smaller lobster with no claws is a whole lobster according to Belgo.And when they take it away and bring you a regular lobster instead, they don't cook you another one. Instead they grab the first one they see so some other customer is also delayed. And you get a replacement lobster that has weird black stuff in it. Because that other customer had asked specifically for balsamic vinegar to be poured into half the lobster. So it looks like you're about to have that black stuff on the alien planet in Prometheus.And then you get the bill and it still has the optional service charge automatically added.So it's gone from 2 stars to 1 star. Sorry Belgo but you suck.And the moral of the story is stand your ground and don't listen to the girl. Life is too short to queue up for bad food in a hot, stuffy basement on a summer evening. Nothing will convince me to return here.",

    "text": "My sister and I happened to be in London one weekend and I had asked friends in advance for something near the Lyric Theatre to eat at that was decent. Belgo was suggested so we decided to give it a go!So it appears the upstairs area was more of a bar and downstairs was where all the eating happened. We were seated in a narrow passing as it was just the two of us, this made for a rather \"cosy\" environment, not the best place to sit, to be honest. It was also dimmer where we sat, so I can't help but feel we got the worst seats in the place.We decided to get some drinks since it was a wet evening. I ordered the Boon Kriek Lambic Cherry since cherry is my favourite fruit flavour (next to pear). This is a gorgeous fruit beer and quite high on my favourite alcoholic drinks. It's not as sweet as ciders but still, has that fruity taste. My sister ordered the Floris Framboise which I also recommend.Given the fact that Belgo's two main selling points were their mussels and rotisserie chicken, we decided to order one of each to see if they lived up to the hype. Our small table struggled to store everything we ordered, as you can see.The Thai and Kimchi moules were awfully tempting, but alas my sister does not eat spicy food so we had to compromise. We ordered the herb and garlic moules in the end, this has the added benefit of actually being able to taste the mussels. These were quite nice and substantial, I'm not a mussels connoisseur, but these were a-ok and I'd happily come back here again if I had a mussels craving.Next up was the Belgo Beer BBQ chicken. The sauce on this was soooo good and the chicken was very tender and moist. It's a shame the chicken looks so sad on its own as the sides came in their own bowls. Overall, a thumbs up for me.For each main, you had a choice of sides to accompany them. You can choose between bread, chips or salad to accompany the mussels. For the chicken, it was chips or salad. I had thought that the bread would be perfect for mopping up the sauce that went with the mussels, but I decided to go for chips in the end as it sort of went with both chicken and mussels. I would recommend you go for bread if you are ordering mussels, though!The salad is very much needed as there was a distinct lack of veggies in the meal. Although the salad was very varied and dressed nicely I did feel that the salad was disproportionally small, compared to the chips.The speculoos cheesecake was a must, even though at this point both of us were rather full. We shared one and the Lotus biscuit pretty much fell after I took this photo, it probably wasn't necessary. The cake was delicious although on the small side for \u00a35.50.Overall, he atmosphere and seating weren't brilliant. The staff were very pleasant and quick, though, so we weren't made to feel like third class passengers in service as least. I felt that they were ever so slightly overpriced, especially the cheesecake \u00a0The small salad was also disappointing, more salad, please! I would probably not visit Belgo again. The place was nice but nothing spectacular. As the chain only seems to be in London and Nottingham, I don't think I'd visit again as there are other places I've yet to eat at.",

Dinner for 2 during the week: this place could be interesting if you are large group of friends but for a couple could be too noisy (the open kitchen add another layer of \u00a0noise on top of the one coming from the big tables around you)Men\u00f9 is not so big which is good but what you'll get is an average meal from an average franchise. I had the chicken (make i simple choice) which was not particularly amazing, not tasty and also the inside was cooked ok-ish (some parts could have been cooked more). My friend had the mussels with chips which he said were ok but as I said before, nothing special ,the chips were better than the mussels.The only thing that was good were the fried calamari, tasty and properly crispy!Beer selection is huge and brilliant, they also have the Leffe on draught. I had the PAUWEL KWAK which was really good and served in glass with wooden stand and my friend had a Trappiste,Westmalle Tripel, also really good.Other than that, my friend Belgo, what I would suggest to you will be: be more authentic in terms of food, as your drinks are amazing already, and you'll be paid back with better reviews (at least mine!).",

You head down either a warehouse-style elevator or metal-caged stairway into a maze of brick-lined arched tunnels branching off in different directions with long benches that make for great cavorting with large groups.The food is not bad, and even traditional Belgian items like mussels come in gigantic kettles that are worthy conversation starters in and of themselves. Also, the Belgian beer selection is amazingly extensive and covers different styles, including trappist, gueuze, and fruit beers.The adventure even extends to the unisex bathroom with the communal washing fountain.

It's a tiny door to get in, and then you descend into this gigantic basement full of tables, bars, and a massive open kitchen. \u00a0It's like a warehouse environment with the waitresses dressed in black and waiters dressed like European soccer players. Their specialties are mussels, fries, and Belgium style beer!I started with a pint of Strawberry Fruli beer - one of my favorites since it's sweet and goes down smoothly. \u00a0The foam reminded me of cream from Asian bubble teas! \u00a0I was also surprised to see banana, coconut, cherry, and black currant beers as well!For lunch I got the 1-kg bucket of mussels, served Traditional style, which is a light garlic white wine broth with parsley, onions and celery. \u00a0Mussels were fresh and tasty. Despite being smaller than ones I've had in the USA there were so many of them it took a while! \u00a0They offer bread also if you like to dip the broth. \u00a0Fries came with the order and were seasoned, and crispy. \u00a0This place is probably funner with a group, since you can mix and match from a dozen or so different preparations of mussels from your friends. \u00a0Plus you might get to try more of their wonderful beers!",

    "text": "So I finally got around to visiting Belgo Centraal. \u00a0Not being much of a beer drinker and not even a huge fan of mussels in meals in the past, I wasn't expecting much.When I entered, I was surprised by the industrial vibe going on. \u00a0I thought to myself, 'Where is the dining room'. \u00a0I walked over what appeared to be a bridge overlooking a kitchen. \u00a0'What's that down there?'We went downstairs after speaking to the host, where the restaurant opens up into an industrial-style canteen, with the open-plan kitchen as a centre point. \u00a0The place was loud and festive. \u00a0I looked over the drinks menu and was taken aback by the sheer number of beers on offer. \u00a0All the fruity beers piqued my non-beer-drinking interest, and I opted for Mongozo Banana Beer. \u00a0The Husbatron Prime ordered Chimay Bleu, seasoned Belgian beer drinker that he is. \u00a0Since we were at a restaurant known for its mussels, I decided to order a mussel pot traditionelle to do a litmus test of tastiness. \u00a0(Husbatron ordered the duck.)One word. \u00a0Delicious.The Mongozo Banana Beer was so exotic and exciting to the non-beer drinker in me that I wanted to try all the fruity beers on the menu and then some. \u00a0The mussels were above average, so much so that I'm now interested in returning for some of the more inspired varieties on the menu. \u00a0The frites that came with both meals were obviously frozen food-service chips (I had my suspicions and then I saw someone pour them from a bag into the fryer on my way to the toilet), but they were as enjoyable as any deep-fried potato would be, really. \u00a0Speaking of the toilets, I found them a bit confusing. \u00a0They were virtually communal but segregated toilets with a central (although more toward the men's toilets than the women's ones) carousel-looking sink. \u00a0Two bathroom attendants were present, with the usual array of cheap colognes and a completely obviously placed tip plate. \u00a0I really don't like toilet attendants. \u00a0I can wash my own hands and really prefer not to return to my dining companion smelling of cheap hooker. \u00a0And then I have to go and be all guilt-ridden for not tipping them for squirting some soap into my hands and handing me a towel since I was caught unawares having gone to the toilet without any money.Oh yeah, we also got dessert, which, refreshingly, didn't taste like simply an afterthought on the menu. \u00a0The bread and butter pudding was scrumptious. \u00a0I think it was better than the Husbatron's Belgian waffle, although he would probably say he enjoyed his just fine (dessert envy).I have to be honest when I say that most of the stars for Belgo Centraal are going toward the sheer volume and breadth of Belgian beer offerings on the menu. \u00a0Because of my visit here, I'm inspired to visit Belgo's more bar-like Bierodrome on Kingsway, which will probably result in me getting good and hammered, since I want to try, like, every beer on the drinks menu.",

It takes bookings, but even when the 'reservation area' is full, you can turn up and get a seat pretty quickly if you get there early enough as there is a lot of seating space.2. If you do get there early (which may well be the case if you are indeed planning on catching a show) then the Beat the Clock deal (pay the time [between 5 and 6.30] for your food) is fantastic. Warning: not all mussels are part of this deal, as they curiously seem to be in the Northern branch - something to do with north/south divisions, probably.3. The service is quick quick quick. Ok, so I eat my food too fast, but I had finished my meal less than half an hour after arriving!!4. It does what it says on the tin i.e. it's centraaaaaal. That means you can walk to Shaftsbury Ave or the Strand in less than ten minutes. Winner.Other than that, the food is really tasty (and some of the mussels are heeeooouuuge) as well as the massive list of beers for pre-show oiling.",

They don't skimp.As for brews, you can't go wrong with a pint of Chimay, Hoegaarden, or Leffe. For sweet lovers, they have Strawberry Fruli. Also interesting to try (at least for me) was the honey beer and the chocolate beer.The main seating area is in the lower level and its canteen-style with its long tables & benches. The servers are dressed as monks. The beams have hooks so you can hang your coats. The lighting is dim, and the ambiance is lively and boisterous. For Friday nights and weekends, bookings should be done. For bigger groups, bookings a must. Now, it does take quite a time to have a full meal here, so don't come expecting a quick lunch.

The atmosphere and layout is fantastic, with the entrance walkway overlooking the kitchens, flames and smoke dragging you down into the depths of the cellars. Staff don monk uniforms and it gives the impression that you're invading some cult in the middle of London. But fun and not a strange electrode machine in sight.",

    "text": "On the back leg of my fantastic honeymoon, we once again found ourselves in the midst of an 8 hour layover in wonderful, sunny London! That's right, 80 and sunny! So you wonder why we spent the better part of 2 hours in an underground Belgian restaurant? That's what I thought, until Mark started bringin' the beer!My bud Shoe left us an email that this is the spot we should hit up during our brief stay before heading back over State's side, so we ventured over to Covent Garden. After looking around like the idiot tourist we were, I finally spotted the red flag posted on the side of a discreet brick building.Why the hell would shoe send us here? I mean, cool interior, nice lunch crowd, but kind of looked like another chain from the US of A.Not so fast.We sat down at our communal table and Mark asked us what we fancied. We opted for what their known for (at least what Mark said they were), mussels and fritas. Mmmm, delish! The mussels were cooked perfect, that is, falling off the shell, and the fritas were long and crisped to perfection. But enough with the food... On to the main event!My first beer was the one I fell in love with at Holly Bush, Stella. Des opted for a Delirium, which is now one of her faves (not sure if its for the beer or for the mug with the purple elephants!) I then moved onto a Chimay Reserve after my 2nd Stella. I don't remember what Des went for next (hey, a couple of Stella's followed by a Chimay and nearly 5 years ago will do that to you!) But hey, maybe it was the 4-5 samples Mark insisted that we try during our stay! So this is why Shoe sent us here!As the room started swaying, I think it was Des that talked Mark into parting with a couple of his purple elephant Delirium mugs!Not to make the same mistake we did on the leg over, we left Belgo happy and 3 1/2 hours before our flight. We took the Underground back to Paddington, arriving about 2 hours pre-flight.\"I'm so happy we wont be rushed this time\"An hour and twenty minutes later, the train arrived. 2 trains delayed, we hopped on board, now extremely nervous. 1/2 hour trip, and 10 minutes to storm Heathrow until we miss our flight.As the train approaches the terminal, we ready ourselves at the door, like sprinters in the blocks, and...BOOM!Doors open and we sprint to the security line. Des begs the person in the front that we now have 8 minutes to make the flight. He feels bad, and lets us pass.Next the escalator. Actually, I can't quite remember if this was before the security check or after. Hey, I was about 6-7 beers down and this WAS 5 years ago, so who cares!I fly up the escalator, with Des in tow, when I hear a shatter. I turn to look, and see her souvenir mugs all over the floor! They had fallen out of her backpack and were now spread all over the floor of Heathrow!She looks up...she looks down at the broken mess...5 minutes.\"RUN!!!!\" I scream. And she does.We sprint down the terminal (again) and just catch the Gate checker closing the gate.\"Wait! Wait!\"\"Oh, there you are! The Gallaghers, I presume?\"Ahoy. On our way!Oh yeah, the plane had a technical difficulty and we sat on the tarmac for another 45 minutes!",

Had fortune not smiled on me so unexpectedly, Belgo would probably have lost another star in addition to:- - one docked for service; slow and a little unfriendly. This varied from server to server, as the one who admitted to an error in accompanying the starter with a side did so sweetly, while the waiter who'd actually served it simply shrugged and walked off. - two for mediocre and not-hot-enough food. This was very disappointing, as I'd been keen to show the place off to my date. Maybe a Saturday afternoon during the January sales wasn't such a good idea. Try in summer when everyone wants to be outside and the Belgo dungeon is less busy!",

It's cheerful, funky, and fun, and if you can pull yourself away right after work, the M-F Beat-The-Clock special is a steal. A nice bowl of mussels and frites for between 5-6 quid is a bargain, and the other beat-the-clock specials (like the veggie tart) are also nice. Add a glass of Hoegaarden Grand Cru or Saison 1900, and it's a perfect casual meal. It's also great for kids, with a filling meal and ice cream for \u00a35. The waiters' costumes are a treat for the kids to watch, too, and the unisex Battlestar Galactica-esque bathroom is fun for kids and adults.",

OMG SOOOO GOOD. Who ever said that beer cannot go with desert was mental.The design of the restaurant was really cool too. As you walk in you can see the chefs firing dishes and then you walk down and your seated in a sort of modern underground beer garden (there is also a sit down restaurant side but who would want to do that?). The loo was also super cool... it was all open and men and women were in the same room though different sides and washed their hands in a ginormous sink.Our server was really nice and the food was hot, fresh and tasty and the beers were great as well. Definitely coming back here the next time I make it down to London.*REMEMBER:-Beat the clock Special!!!-Raspberry fruit beer-Make a reservation because it gets kind of busy-Check out the bathroom (hahaha)",

We decided to make a reservation for the restaurant rather than sit at the huge tables in the dining hall. The prices were rather high--even for London--and the food was just average. I wanted mussels, but they were out of them. Who ever heard of a Belgian restaurant specializing in mussels being out of them on a Wednesday evening? The Belgian beer selection was just OK--I expected some rare, highly rated Belgian brews like Westie (Westvleteren ale) on the menu and yes, I know it's hard to get but this place has the money to track some down. However, not to be totally negative, this is a fun place to meet up with friends if you are in London and well-located with Covent Garden and Soho pubs nearby.",

The steak is a sad little tough cut, so don't do that.But enough about the food, who are you kidding, you go here for the ale, right? \u00a0Belgian Ale kick all sorts of ass, and they have the twenty page beer menus here.. none cheap, but most start at 6% and destroy most of the otherwise boring crap you find in pubs in the area. \u00a0My Brugse Zot on wasn't as amazing as I remembered it in Brugge, but it hit the spot.Oh yeah, the waitstaff walk around in trappist robes which kind of lends an odd cultist look to them, but their little symbols imprinted dead center of their chests kind of look like Decepticon logos, and in that light it' a neat little cross-cultural twist.",

So when we got to the restaurant to find out our favourite surf and turf dish was off the menu I was immediately a little disppointed but we continued anyway.I ordered rib eye steak and my wife ordered the 'Snob', mussels cooked in lobster bique with fried. The steak was quite soft and tender but everything else was poor. The fries were not hot, the lobster bisque was a watery soup that didn't really taste like a bisque but the biggest problem was the amount of MSG or artificial flavouring they now use - we were so thirsty. The next morning I was absolutely gasping for water.If there is a positive, the atmosphere is excellent, really noisy and ideal for large parties.

I wasn't overwhelmed by anything in particular but if you're not completely unfed an order of mules-frites and a starter/side is quite satisfactory for two.You enter into the restaurant via a dark but futuristic style tunnel to be greeted by a woman with one of those head set microphones conferring with the waiting staff downstairs about availability (which there was lots so I don't quite understand our long wait under curved corrugated steel and tubular lighting), the interior decor is, well, interesting. When you finally venture down into what looks like a would be medieval dungeon -especially given the waiters knight-style dress- it appears to have been confused with an industrially retrofitted nuclear bunker. Nothing wrong with this but just so you know...We ordered the croquettes (note- there are two croquettes only, the minimum on a plate to enable the use of a plural here) with a sort of limp side salad. We went for the Thai style mussels, which wasn't spicy at all, (that that concerns you either way), just a coriander, coconut milky sort of marinade which would have been great for bread dipping (note to self about obtaining a bread basket next time).Impressive selection of beers at mostly reasonable prices, which I would definitely venture back to try more of. When the bill came I'm delighted to say we had something called \"Mussel Madness\" scrawled on the end which was a deduction of a few pounds (maybe 10%? I'm not sure what or how much but thank you Belgos!) so I can't complain about that! Next note to self- it was a Monday maybe that's the madness day...",

    "text": "Who likes mussels?I like mussels! I love mussels in fact!Belgium is not a country that fills me with joy (trip to Antwerp in my first year of uni, Antwerp really wasn't the new Capital if Fashion that I was promised. Didn't see much fashion but did see heroin needles in the street, a man pissing in a plant pot in the middle of a shopping centre and a small dog pulling poo out of it's own butt!), but Belgo's has vastly improved my opinion of this country. I don't know if I would want to go back to Belgium, but I keep going back to Belgo's.Each of my three visits has been really different, but good times were had by all on each of them. Different dishes, different locations of the restaurant and varying times of the day, so I really feel like a Belgo connoisseur.Visit 1. Late night evening meal after much boozing with my ladies.Got to sit in side bunker area, all dark and atmospheric, thought the waiter in his strange giant rubber apron get up was from a horror film and was coming to kill us. Moules Florentine and frites were to die for. I think I actually licked the plate.Visit 2. Early evening civilised eats after work.Good food, good service, good friends. Tried the Moules Portuguese. Nice, tomato-y, new potatoes, healthy option. Bit sad to have just missed the beat the clock offer, but food here is always worth the full price money.Visit 3. Day date for my birthday.Had goat cheese salad (just to be a bit different). Nice and tasty. The man (who is a massive talker and is very rarely ever silent) was so in love with his food he became mute (until the plate was scraped clean, then the talking was back on!). Fishcakes and duck and a variety of different beers all got the thumbs up from him.Coffees finished it all off nicely, but felt service was a little lacking this once.So it's official. Belgo's rocks my world. Loves the food, loves the drinks and love, love loves the building, urban metal and brick tunnels and school type benches to sit on really make this place stand out.",

The novelty of the restaurant is sure to charm your companions and the beer selection is eggggggcellent. Now that they've got a loyalty card, expect me to show up more often.Mmm mussels and beer (I initialy wrote this as \"muscles and beer\", haha oh ME!)",

Do I need to translate?) for \u00a37.5. \u00a0Granted, \u00a37.5 is still over $11 since apparently the British are still punishing us for jumping ship centuries ago, but I could happily delude myself into thinking it was $7.50. \u00a0Now I knew I would be able to eat in Paris later that week and not have to volunteer to be someone's African nanny for the day!My eyes danced the entire time I was at Belgo: the servers dress like Belgian monks, the walls are lined with kegs and kegs of delicious Belgian beer (I believe they have a variety of hundreds. \u00a0HUNDREDS, people!) and I loved the industrial interior. \u00a0Even the bathroom was an experience - it was co-ed and there wasn't much dividing the male and female sides and you share a sink. \u00a0I was a bit slow on the uptake so when I saw a dude walk by me I was ready to bust out some self defense moves 'cause I will cut a mofo who gets to close to me and my lady business uninvited. \u00a0But, all was well, he belonged there. \u00a0I asked our Dutch-looking server if I could take a photo of her and her uniform - she gave me a strange look, which being in London I couldn't decipher whether it meant, \"I don't speak very good English,\" \"Bitch, WTF?\", or \"Idiot American traitors!\" \u00a0I explained to her, squirming in my dorkiness, that I'm someone who likes to take photos of her surroundings to capture the moment and she then bashfully acquiescedThe traditionnelle mussels were tasty. \u00a0They were delivered in a steaming pot seasoned with white wine, celery, onion and garlic. \u00a0Accompanying them were the fries and a side of mayo (of course). \u00a0I left Belgo satiated, less poor than I feared, happily tipsy and ready to go to Belgium for a love affair with a brewery.",

You go downstairs to a modern cellar, benches and tables. It's all open plan making the atmosphere very friendly. I have been many times with friends and the service has nearly always been fast. I don't eat seafood but have tried a few mussels and they were nice (big portions every time). I have tried the pork belly, duck, steak and sausages at various times. They are all great. Never had anyone come along who didn't enjoy it.HINT; women love Belgian beer. The goblets are small enough to try a few but I strongly recommend the Chimay Bleu...three glasses and you feel a bit giggly and stoned. Also, hit a rack of the Schnapps. I am smiling just thinking about Belgo. It is one of the most consistently reliable eating places in town, and I know...I AM A LONDONER.",

The rumours we true: the waiters are Trapiste Monks (ok, not real ones, but still: mighty cool). I didn't get a photo of it, but they also had a CAGE OF BEER. You have to see it to believe it. We chose light lunches from their express lunch menu (one main meal plus Cristal beer/house wine/soft drink, \u00a37.95 a head). Angharad was taking it easy with a goat's cheese salad and a water, Sarah went for the beef carbonnade and a coke, and I chose the spit roast chicken with chilli and ginger sauce, and I had a Cristal (they wouldn't let me substitute it for a kriek, and I even offered to pay more!!). We made a valiant effort \u00a0Angharad was pleasantly surprised by her salad (that goat's cheese looks delicious), Sarah used her beef carbonnade as a dipping sauce for chips, and I ate nearly all of my chicken.",

    "text": "I really should've been studying at home that day, but somehow I ended up having a full day in London, taking la family from HK to see my two uni campuses and also venture into the wellcome museum. Anyways, my family LOVE seafood and I thought what's one place that's a bit unusual. And I had initially wanted to go the belgian mini UYE but decided to work on essay but obviously, that plan flew SO far out the window. So i dragged my family instead.The entrance was unusual, by that I mean, the lights on the floor bake you. It's the new thing. The reception is pretty much an alleyway in the building, and the actual seating areas are downstairs in the basement where men in dress robes will be waiting for you. It's okay, it's not about to get super weird. I promise.You're in a Belgian restaurant, it's got kegs everywhere. BEER O CLOCK. :) We decided to try the Passionfruit one, it's really sweet. More like a sparkling juice. (okay, more like COCKTAIL O CLOCK, but who's checking....) We ordered two pot of 1 kg mussels to share between the 8 of us. Classic and Traditional (with Cream). They were really delicious, the classic one was the best out of the two. I feel like there should've been a bit more seasoning with the cream but it went well with the double cooked frites. We also ordered the pan fried lamb and pan fried duck. Cooked to perfection. Pink in the middle. WIN. The beef stew my brother ordered was a bit sweet, but it was very rich. We also ordered garlic mussels and a seafood stew which were also very fresh. The former was a bit oily, I wish I ordered the one with lobster bisque now. :) I can't remember what else we ordered but we were so full even without dessert. It was also around \u00a3150 for about 8 of us. less than \u00a320 per person inc. service charge. score. The place was buzzing on a tuesday evening, pretty much filled up when we left, so it's a rather popular place. Apparently, lots of hot girls according to the brothers and cousin. Bit disturbing whilst I'm eating but if you're there for good food and uh. girls. I'd \u00a0highly recommend it.P.S: I do realise my review has everything a man wants. beer, food, girls.....",

We reserved the place for 6.15 but most of us turned up at 6.40 but still this was OK which is a little surprising, it didn't take too long midweek on a Wednesday evening. We got served almost immediately with the drinks and the food arrived after about 20 minutes which was reasonable. The great thing overall is that they have revamped the menu, instead of just mussels with cream, they now serve lobster or Japanese crumbs \u00a0or other various sauces. I had the cod burger and it was cooked very nicely throughout and the frites were also quite good. For the Belgian beer, I had the Brugse Zot Brute, not sure what it means but it was recommended by the waiter and it was a very good choice. The beer wasn't too string and it tasted fruity as well as an ale, it was fantastic, not too fizzy. All in all, the new serving Belgo is better than before.",

Nice place is Belgo Centraaaaaaaaaal, looking a little like a 1980s vision of the future, well, the upstairs at least, while downstairs, once you descend the stairs and pass through a rather innocuous looking door, is a room which I expected to be larger than it actually was. Communal seating is the biggest order in this Belgian basement, they'll cram you in somewhere in amongst these long tables.I mentioned Belgian style moules-frites but I, perhaps feeling contrary, opted for Thai style (who knew I'd find that here?). And as it turned out, they were quite nice though I would have liked more chips/frites than I received.I found the service a little haphazard. I needed to remind one waiter that my drink hadn't arrived when I ordered it about 20 minutes prior while another waiter was providing us with parts of our cutlery midway through the meal. All the staff I dealt with appeared keen and friendly but, perhaps, not the most diligent.Also, a number of the staff wear what look an awful lot like cassocks but do not provide any explanation or apparent reasoning behind this decision. I quite like this.All in all, this is a decent place. A place one is not likely to be terribly disappointed with but, at the same time, a place which is unlikely to ever wow you.I don't know the Flemish for 'meh'.Ian",

I should have asked what that was all about. You are seated. \u00a0The place is VERY loud. \u00a0Which I am cool with, but be \u00a0prepared. This is not a place to go for a romantic evening out. \u00a0It is a lively and energetic place. \u00a0It is a Belgian Mussel and beer focused menu. \u00a0The mussels and frites were to die for. \u00a0You can't go wrong. \u00a0Definitely would come back!",

    "text": "We had a small UYE here yesterday so was excited to go back to Belgo Centraal after a long break. The menu is interesting and has many tempting options so clearly well thought out. I decided to order the classic \u00a0moules + frites but with an interesting sounding champagne and lobster sauce. The food came fairly quickly and the moules themselves were pretty good: smooth and cooked just to the right level and very clean. The sauce was pretty good and well flavoured and did indeed have a good lobster taste. Had to ask for a spoon two times for the soupy moules sauce. Why wouldn't they provide a spoon I wonder since no one else seemed to get one either?The frites weren't really Belgian Frites, they were frozen chips which is not the same thing at all and tasted like the fries you get at any fast food joint. ie pretty boring so have to deduct a point for that.Had to ask for Frite sauce (took two attempts). In the past they used to provide that with the frites which I remember being proper frites and so better than this. My request for the sauce was met with some uncertainty and the waiter thought I wanted so clearly not a regular request so bought a mini pot of standard mayo.Beer was good since you can't really go wrong with Belgian beer, especially the bottled varieties which are usually excellent and they have a good range with decent descriptions.Service was a little haphazard and intermittent and does feel a bit like a production line, as others have mentioned. In terms of value, \u00a0again A-OK. Not cheap but then the quality A-OK also.The subterranean brick vault / industrial vibe works well and for a spot to go for informal lunch or dinner in Covent garden, it's a good choice.My last two visits to the Chalk farm branch, Belgo Noord were so much better all around and seems like the centraal branch doesn't have to try so hard since with the central location in crowded Covent Garden there is often a queue outside so go with mid expectations and you will be satisfied.",

Their specialty of mussels were watery and tasteless and the frites were no better than mcdonalds. \u00a0The spare ribs were inedible and even the mashed potatoes were bad. \u00a0And even pasta which one should not be able to mess up was not good. \u00a0The servers were inattentive and surly. \u00a0Don't believe the hype avoid this place like the plague. Especially when in London there are hundreds of wonderful restaurants.",

    "text": "I was recommended this establishment by a friend who raved about it so I decided to go there for supper. Got there at about 8pm on a Wednesday to find it was packed to the rafters with a 45 minute waiting time. Promising but I'm not the sort to wait in a queue so I left and returned the following Saturday at lunchtime. Again, it was busy but my party was quickly shown a table. The atmosphere is allegedly Belgian- I've done Brussels a few times and quite frankly it was little more than a caricature; priests' habits? Please! Nontheless, service was punctual and polite and the menu had a reasonable selection although our vegetarian struggled to find something appealing in a very limited vegetarian selection. Two of us went for the excellent value Express Lunch (choice of main dish from four dishes and a beer for \u00a37.99. Mine, Mussels and chips was fine but not sensational, but Mrs L's meat was gristly although tasty. Many of the Belgian beers are frankly potty - strawberry flavour anyone? - but the list is extensive with something for everyone. In all, the experience was good, not too expensive and quick enough to satisfy the hardcore shoppers in the group. On a final note, the industrial design theme (lots of metal, pipes, etc) gave it a modern and quirky feel which the kids enjoyed. Would I go again? Probably not, but worth trying at least the once; you never know, you might like the taste of Belgian beer!",
