    "text": "My visit to the Ship Inn was the perfect antidote to yet another grey and rainy London evening. On stepping through the doors, I was struck immediately by the warmth of the atmosphere and a setting that exuded character and originality at every turn. With a restaurant and several bar areas the pub is certainly large, but it manages to maintain a sense of intimacy with warm lighting and various visually impressive wood burning fires. I knew at once that this pub would not disappoint. My visit to the Ship Inn was for the occasion of their barbeque launch, where the gastro-pub's proposed offerings for summer 2010 were put to the test. The barbeque is a significant component of the pub and, by all accounts, commands an enormous amount of custom over the summer months. Set over a spacious decked area, there is plenty of room to find a table and soak up the sun when visiting in warmer months. The menu is extensive and ranges from the usual (burgers and steaks) to the rather more unique (devilled lamb's kidneys and Coca-Cola ribs), ensuring that there is plenty to tempt even the most demanding gourmand. Perhaps, however, I use the term 'usual' liberally. While a burger may feature on every barbeque line-up, the ones offered by the Ship Inn are certainly not the standard frozen pub-grub. Hand-made on site with a blend of beef, lamb, mustard and other special seasonings, is comes succulent and fresh, severe on bed of lettuce and tomato and topped with Emmental cheese and home-made mustard mayonnaise and tomato and herb chutney. The end result was a masterpiece that will have even the most pretentious foodie exhaling the common burger. As for the starters, the two new additions to the menu were without fault. The devilled lamb's kidneys were cooked to perfection, while the 'Pig in a Jar', a home-made blend of pork and other secret ingredients forming a thick p\u00e2t\u00e9, was unbelievably moorish and I could have happily eaten this amazing creation all day. Among the other menu offerings of particular note, I recommend the rack of pork ribs in a Coca-Cola barbeque sauce, with amazingly tender meat and a unique taste. The lamb skewer is another favourite, with succulent meat and beautifully charred peppers and onions. If you're looking for something unique to wash it down with, then look no further than Sambrook's Wandle, a smooth and easy-drinking ale that will convert even the most die-hard lager lover. As you may deduce from the length of this I cannot say enough to recommend the Ship Inn. In the winter months you can enjoy 5* dining inside this atmospheric pub, and as the warmer months approach you can head outside for a cool beer and some truly excellent food. This one is worth travelling for, and if you're looking for a great place to spend a sunny afternoon this summer, then look no further.",

    "text": "A bit out of the way this one - it's just off the Wandsworth roundabout in a sort of industrial, warehouse block that smells like sulfur and runs into the Thames. Not picturesque really but a good pub, in much the same way that the gysers in New Zealand are a good sight, despite the sulfur. In the summer it makes great use of the space in front and has a big garden down to the river. In the winter it is all about the inside and there are a few different spaces, a dining room, a light conservatory style bar/lunch area and a proper, wooden and darker pub bit.The pub bit is where I like. You can still hear and enjoy the atmosphere in the other rooms but the lights are less aggressive and you can talk without fighting other conversations. It gets busy you see. I had fish and chips last time I was here - it was quite nice. A little light on the fish perhaps and the peas, there weren't many, but the quality was good enough. They have cider and loads of ales on tap too. I think the atmosphere can vary greatly depending on the day of the week/time etc.. but the food and drink are usually a good standard, I suppose it just depends how much you care about the other people eating and drinking with you.",

The inner restaurant does high-quality food - and it's pretty expensive, but worth every penny. I had a one of the best grilled salmons I have ever tasted. The wine list is good too and their Sancerre is totally delicious, though they need to offer a few more high-end New Zealand/ Australian/Chilean Pinot Noirs. But it's real charm is the all-day summer barbecue of both fish and meat. The river runs alongside and the whole area catches the sunset. Free wi-fi as well. What more could you possible want?",

A nice regular crowd hang here - I went for early evening drinks to catch up with friends,s o we could have a chat, before getting a taxi to Clapham to continue the night in a bar with louder music, which it was perfect for! I also hear the food is very good, although I didn't get the chance to try it myself. It has an outside bar / bbq area, which I'm sure would be gorgeous in nice weather (where is summer??). Note: It is quite hard to find this pub, being located down a little ally behind McDonalds, hence making it a bit of a hidden gem, but also a bit of a nightmare if you are arranging a meeting for the first time.",

    "text": "There aren't many places that I'd brave a downpour to visit, but then I'd already seen The Ship Wandsworth's barbecue menu and was looking forward to sampling such delights as devilled lamb's kidneys served on a gem salad with toasted hazelnuts and a pea and mint dressing and a full rack of West Country ribs served with a Coca-Cola barbecue sauce. It seemed that everyone had something good to say about The Ship, from the friends that I told I was going to the woman that I flagged down for directions. The Ship is hidden from the main high street and lies between a bus garage and a BMW dealership, but the first person I asked for directions new instantly where I was talking about and couldn't stop gushing about the food. I was the first of our group to arrive and Emma, Oisin and the team did a great job of making me feel comfortable. I was served a delicious glass of Shiraz \u00a0You, Me and the Gatepost which the team were considering adding to their new wine list. The staff were really keen to hear our opinions on everything and this really made me feel valued. We were provided with a list of the dishes that we would be sampling and a space next to the menu where we could leave our feedback. The idea was that we would head outside and watch one of the dishes being cooked before heading back into drier climes. There was one major reason why this didn't happen \u00a0The food was so good! After tucking into the first dish of devilled lamb's kidneys everyone was so preoccupied with how incredibly tasty the food was that little things like rain and cold didn't matter one bit. I really enjoyed the devilled lamb's kidneys and pea and mint dressing with hazelnuts worked really well as an accompaniment to the dish. However, it was the next dish on the menu that was to remain my all-time-favourite; the unusually named pig in a jar. Actually pig in a jar is exactly what it says on the...jar? A pork terrine/pate that has a creamy consistency and goes incredibly well with the crispy toast it's served with. Whilst not typically a barbecue item it works really well and the main feedback from the Qype team regarding this dish was the fact that it should be served as a takeaway item! Another favourite dish was the chargrilled beef and lamb burger; as well as being barbecuing geniuses The Ship make their own tomato and herb chutney. The burger was probably the juiciest that I've had in my life and whereas in many pubs I'm forced to take the roll of the burger to taste the meat underneath, with The Ships you barely even noticed that the bread was there. If I had the space I'd go on and on gushing about each individual item on the menu from the rack of West Country ribs that fell apart in your mouth to the beautifully seared asparagus and buffalo mozzarella salad. The truth is that there really wasn't a bad dish to be had at The Ship Inn and everything we tasted was perfection. If you're looking for Ale to wash this all down with, may I recommend Sambrooks? We met the team from the nearby Sambrooks brewery at the ship and, although I'm not an Ale drinker, I loved the Wandle ale which had a crisp, clean taste not far off from lager. Whilst I've gone overboard mentioning the food the pub has plenty more contributing to its friendly atmosphere, from the promoting of local breweries to the cheerful Irish band jamming away at one of the tables. I will definitely be returning to The Ship, the only question is how soon can I get there?",

As the day turned into night we headed inside from the massive seating area to be entertained by live musicians who humoured the dancers by several encores, much to the lust of all on the floor. The entire soul of this place will leave you a regular just after the first visit. A definite favourite of mine. Thanks to the team for such a great day!!!",

It's perfect for a relaxing beer with friends on a nice day. The best part about inside is that they have a big wood-burning stove, which sets a great atmosphere for cold and rainy London nights.The main down-sides are that the place gets packed and loud on weekends. Also, they have grill where you can get burgers and chicken sandwiches. While there is nothing wrong with the food from the grill, it could be better. The food is a bit pricey for what it is, but that shouldn't be too surprising considering that it's in London.I think this place might also have an actual sit-down restaurant, but I haven't tried it so I can't comment.All that being said, this is a great place to meet up with friends as long as you avoid weekend nights.",

Staff were a little overwhelmed on our visit; my coffee order (which the waitress repeated before walking off) was forgotten, and ended up arriving with the food after I left the table to chase it up.Was also a little disappointed that none of the BBQ food outdoors was offered to diners inside (Seems a little unreasonable considering its all run by the same establishment). Oh and the toilets were out of order on the day we visited, which meant a twenty minute queue for the one disabled toilet which was now being shared by guys and girls - nightmare. I guess they were having a bad day - have been many times before with no trouble.. would still return..",

    "text": "In the interest of full disclosure, I was here last night for a Qype event where we were given the great privilege of trying out a selection from The Ship's barbecue menu (which will be launched once there seems to be some consistent spring weather). First off, given The Ship's location - down a side road near Wandsworth Bridge - it isn't the sort of place you'd spot while walking down the street, and decide that you should give it a go. It's had to rely mostly on word of mouth, which means that it has had to be pretty darn good at what it does. And all signs yesterday indicate that this is indeed the case. General manager Oisin, head chef David and marketing manager Emma have done a great job with the place, and, more importantly, the menu! They were really attentive and friendly throughout the event, taking the time to talk us through the menu, and - in a sign that they truly cared - asked for our written opinions on each and every one of the dishes they served. I've been to a few foodie events, but no one's asked me such detailed feedback before. And when I made an offhand remark about hwo they should have corn-on-the-cob on the menu, Emma immediately conveyed that feedback to David, who told me that it was on the cards. And that's just one example of their excellent customer service. Now, on to the food. The intriguingly-named 'pig in a jar' was fantastic, and definitely something which they should think of selling for people to take home. Much lighter than what I'd expect from a pork dish. A great way to start off the meal, for sure. The chargrilled handmade beef and lamb burger was incredible. The meat was succulent, the tomato chutney was delicious and the bun was pretty good, though to be honest, I didn't really notice the bun amidst all the delicious meat. I honestly thought the burger would be the highlight of the meal, but next up was the rack of pork ribs with coca-cola barbecue sauce (David's secret recipe). Tender, fall-off-the-bone meat combined with tasty, tangy, sweet sauce. Yummy. After my first bite, I declared that they were ribs worth getting into a fight for, so it was good that The Ship offered us two full racks! The wine which was served along with the food - You, Me and the Gatepost, Shiraz, 2008 - went very well. Nice and smooth. Now, I am a hardcore carnivore. (Like you couldn't tell from my description of the food.) The mere mention of the word 'barbecue' is enough to make me salivate. And yesterday's barbecue was amazing. I will be back. It's not an easy trek for me as I live in East London, but I will most definitely be back!",

The location is great, right by the river on one side of Wandsworth Bridge, and it has good outside space to enjoy it.On a sunny day the outside area tends to be very busy, but there is plenty of space inside too. It is very big actually, and it has a mazey feel to it too, which adds charm. I particularly like sitting on the outside tables at the back of the restaurant area. The shame is that the barbecue is next to it so you will get all its fumes, which it's not pleasant.Overall, it has a great feeling. There is a but though, as usual! And it is a big but, its food! When you check the menu you feel like you are in a gourmet pub, not only by its pricey mains but also because of the sound of them. I am a big fan of risotto and I didn't feel like meat so I went for their veggie risotto, which sounded amazing. It was ok, nothing else (it really wasn't creamy). I wouldn't order it again.Ok, so that was once. I decided to then give it another go on another day, and this time I went for the barbeque food, which seemed to have a lot of followers. I love my sausages, so I ordered a sausage bap. I thought that you couldn't get a sausage bap wrong. Actually, you can.The bread was wrong, the mustard was wrong, the half-cut sausages were wrong, even the very thinly cut onion wasn't quite right.I have to say that the burgers looked really good though and loads of people were ordering them in the restaurant (I think the ones from the restaurant were different from the ones on the barbeque but I cannot be sure). I should have ordered one of those instead. I may give it one last try just because I am a big burger fan. I will ponder over it.",

Incredible atmosphere, BBQ smoking, absolutely packed with people enjoying the last glimpses of sunshine London has to offer. Great atmosphere, especially as the band started to play later on in the evening.Definitely not classy or a good place to take a first date, however packed of fun :) dress down compulsory",

Very much a Thames side location, though there is only about 4 tables that are actually in a good spot to enjoy the view, and even then that's only when you are facing the right way.Good selection of food on the BBQ menu, and there is also a Dining Room menu if its's either raining or too full outside (the dining area looks quite inviting, so you're not losing out it you end up inside). Veggie option chickpea burger actually tastes better than it looks and gets a thumbs up from me, my man, and my toddler... I just wish that we'd gotten a fewer fries and a little more salad (my kid could eat his weight in fries given the chance).",

I had an Aspall cider and my boyfriend had a Heiniken but there were a lot of drinks on tap (I have yet to try a Young's beer/bitter/etc). We went outside for five minutes before we got cold but they did have heaters and a huge patio that I imagine would be nice during summer. After going back inside I saw large groups of people having lunch together, the food looked very tasty. I definitely plan on coming back to the Ship to try the food. My boyfriend said he has ate there before and he enjoyed it.",

    "text": "What a treat. The Ship is famous for being the location, many moons ago, for me and my chums to have an impromptu boozing session. This consisted almost exclusively of cider. This great day became known as Cider Sunday. Any drinking or socialising on a Sunday became known as Cider Sunday. So when I returned back to Wandsworth Town to the Ship I had memories of good times. I didn't expect for it to have become, since I was here last, to be elevated to one the greatest pubs in the entire world. I was greeted my Ois the Landlord who made sure I had a pint in my hand and I went for a Sambrook's Wandle ale. As I took a sip of this delicious beer I was introduced to Mr Duncan Sambrook. As in Sambrook's ale? Yes! I told him it was like being handed a pint of Guinness and then being introduced to Arthur Guinness himself. Sambrook's is a proper local brew, one of the only proper London breweries, it is about a mile from Big Ben. No micro-brewery or out in the sticks kind of brewery. This is the real deal. The beer is London in a glass (but cleaner). It tastes like a golden sunset type best bitter and is brewed locally. This is fresh and tastes great. I learn that there is another Sambrook's bitter, a dark ruby brown bitter called Junction, named after Clapham Junction on the opposite side of the brewery to the Ship in Wandsworth. This wasn't on tap, but possibly be by the time you're reading this. The fact that this brewery is sticking to two proper beers rather than the artisan experimental Meantime brewery of Greenwich, means that these guys are serious about making proper beer. With pint in hand I headed to the outdoors to check out the new barbecue menu. Now, the phrase BBQ tends to suggest burnt bangers and dodgy chicken-legs. However, the Ship redefines a barbecue menu. This is gourmet, proper modern cooking with excellent ingredients, some creativity and a hot outdoor grill. As Dave the Chef guided us through the sampling of the dishes I felt like a kid in sweetshop, where they've replaced the candy with tasty morsels such as devilled lamb's livers and the INCREDIBLE 'Pig in a Jar'. In fact, the French style pork-ham-hock-celery-carrot terrine served in a chutney jar that is smeared on hot toast is so legendary it has it's own twitter hashtag: #piginajar, naturally. It get's even better, when the ribs are covered in Dave's famous Coca-Cola BBQ sauce which marinades the meat along with secret spices, brown sugar and The Real Thing\u2122. I also tried their home-made tasty burger, was it made of lamb? was it beef? It is indeed 2-in-1. Win! Other menu items including posh kebabs, spatchcock chicken, fresh fish and they're all worthwhile you heading down to the Ship right now and eating your way through the entire menu. Ois and the wonderful Emma form the Ship were telling me that they've started a Cider Saturday at the Ship to celebrate the iconic apple beverage although I like to think me and my chums inspired the thought. Perhaps in future years, there'll be a blue plaque celebrating one of these days of cider. Another thing I learnt from my enjoyable visit to the Ship, is that Ois opens the outside area at 14 degrees centigrade. This is British summer. Yes, folks. If you wanted to know whether to stick on coat and scarf and enjoy a pint of Junction bitter in the cosiness of the Ship or whether to put on your shorts and flip-flops and enjoy some gourmet BBQ and Pimm's on the terrace by the river check out the weather and hope for 14 degrees. After all, it's summertime.",

    "text": "The Ship - one of my locals and a damn fine pub at that. For some stupid reason I resisted frequenting the Ship for 3 years. Yes, 3 whole years dear reader. God knows what I was thinking. Maybe it was the sight of a crowded terrace every time I walked past, or, even perhaps the fact that the bbq could, if not properly attended, give me some serious Delhi Belly. And being a modest man I am happy to say when I get it wrong. And this time I got it wrong. Big time.A massive outdoor terrace gives everyone a fighting chance of bagging a table, either in the shaded leafy area or on the sun lovers wooden deck. The seats don't match, the benches may give you splinters, but this is what real English pubs are all about. My reservations about the bbq were totally unfounded. And what a GENIUS system they have in place for ordering and serving of bbq food. You go up to the bbq, order, pay, take a number and sit down. Then, when your food is ready a happy announcer calls out your number over the tannoy. Brilliant. No more hungover waitresses, no more embarrassing friends belittling the waiter - this is quite simply a revolution. Amazeballs.I didn't see much of the inside on my visit. I was enjoying the 3 days of British Summer and was trying to top up my t-shirt suntan. What I did see on my way to the little boy's room was spacious and well laid out. The interconnecting rooms worked well, and in the winter months I can see being pretty damn cosy.Prices - well, not too bad. BBQ food was reasonably priced, yet the menu for the more formal dining inside seemed a little higher.Yes, the Ship is in a random part of town. But well worth a trip. Wandsworth Town train station is a stones throw away, and if you feel like it (after bingeing on burgers) follow the river through Bell Lane Creek and into Wandsworth Park. A lovely park and a great walk to Putney where multiple transport options will aid you on your trek home.",

Listening to the chefs speak about their food, it was clear that this was their passion - and they have created a menu that is wonderful, surprising and I believe genuinely pushes the boundaries of what a barbeque can be. Every dish was wonderful, but highlights for me were the Coca-Cola BBQ Ribs - oozy, sticky, melt-in-the-mouth deliciousness - and \"pig-in-a-jar\" - a lovely chunky pate served with home-made bread - I really wish I could have taken home a few jars! All accompanied by Sambrooks Wandle Ale - a great South-London brewed ale that's light, refreshing and just perfect for summer. The Ship is a very special place indeed, with friendly, passionate staff, a very welcoming atmosphere, well-served local ale and a BBQ menu that's close to perfect. Go there!",

    "text": "This place came highly recommended by a lot of friends so I was really excited when the opportunity finally presented itself to go for a friend's birthday drinks. I'm not in the area much, as I live on the opposite side of town, but this is supposedly a very popular pub for those who live in the Chelsea/Fulham/Putney/Wandsworth area. It is right across the river from Fulham and sits along the water, which is of course quite scenic.The most striking this is that the vibe is utterly sensational. I was there on a Saturday night and everyone was dressed so well (never seen that in a pub before!) and it is full of attractive 20-somethings in groups of girls and guys, ready to go out. On the night we went, there was one group reservation that spanned 5 tables that had been there since 3 PM and seemed to be still going hard 6 hours later.The outdoor area is quite large and about half of it is uncovered wooden tables, and the other half is a covered area that has both wooden tables and several booths that fit around 10 people. It started raining halfway through the night and people were able to move under cover quite easily, and some moved inside where there is a proper dance floor and decent music. To be honest, they make it just so that there is no reason to leave... it's got everything you want.In addition, the outdoor area also features a BBQ grill, and they have a menu offering burgers, sausages, and a few other items. We ordered the beef burger, which came with fries but cost a cool 12 pounds. However, we received a lot of food envy afterward because it was a very solid, well-constructed burger. They also have a very cool texting service, where you type in your mobile number onto a keypad and they text you when you order is ready. Fancy!I completely understand why friends love this place, and if it was any closer to home, I would be there all the time. But with such an amazing atmosphere, I will certainly have to plan a return trip soon!",

    "text": "I entered the Ship rather apprehensively given some of the other reviews here but left knowing I couldn't give it less than five stars.The food here is simply excellent. My friend and I came here on a Sunday and opted for two chicken roasts. The chicken was cooked well and accompanied by a huge Yorkshire pudding, gravy, roast potatoes and various sides, such as sweet potato puree. If I had one complaint about the roast it would be that the potatoes could have been slightly warmer, but 'tis a small blemish.No matter though, because the desserts took the experience up a couple of notches. I went for a fig and maple syrup bakewell tart with prune ice cream and my friend sticky toffee pudding with ice cream. One bite of each was all it took to seal this place's 5 star rating: warm, flavoursome and oozing quality. The sticky toffee pudding was particularly good, up there with the very best I've had.Elsewhere, there are plenty of other pluses. Though a Young's pub, it had a few other ales on draft, including the ever-dependable Samsbrook Wandle and new beer Pumphouse Pale Ale. The other food on offer looked very good too: tempting scotch eggs that sadly they'd sold out of when we took our seats; burgers in posh baps and string fries. The rest of the dessert menu was extraordinary, containing no less than five dessert wines, something I've never seen before on a pub menu. And perhaps most surprising of all, the food wasn't that expensive: about \u00a313 for the roast chicken, \u00a34 for the Samsbrooks and an admittedly fairly expensive but still worth it \u00a37 for the desserts. Service was good and there's plenty of space inside.The only slight negative of the experience was that it took about 20 minutes to be seated. Really though, that's not bad compared to how long waits can be. And in this instance, it was easily worth it.As for the yuppies, it's true that there were a few here, but they were in the minority. I didn't find them particularly irksome - not like the masses of hipsters to be found out east. And indeed, arguably if it weren't for the spending power and preferences of this Fulham set, the food wouldn't be what it is, so heck, it could be said they're a force for good...",

    "text": "Visited on Holiday, was absolutely blown away by the electric atmosphere, friendly locals and most excellent view.Most Americans don't get to see this side of London, as we often find ourselves playing tourist in downtown London, Mayfair and South Bank. Get out of the tourist trap and see what a real outdoor pub is like. A spectacular view of the area (Thames included), with a packed group of locals in the Beer Garden (Patio area). I met up with some friends from London, but I quickly found myself wandering from table to table making new friends. For the most part, we were welcome.Word to the wise.... security can be a bit tight as the hours go on, so if you're too inebriated, they'll likely notice, and remove you quickly. We watched a few groups of guys get tossed because of their behavior.",

    "text": "I have been to The Ship a few times during the summer and it has always been a pleasant place, nice grilled food, good beer, amazing river views and a great crowd. Having gone today for a Sunday roast the experience was quite the opposite. The service was rushed and not very pleasant. The two slices of roast beef were served lukewarm and the trimmings were not very well cooked or it felt like they have been cooked hours ago and they kept being warmed up. The gravy was super thin and when we asked for post roast drinks they did not have Port, Amaretto or Cointreau (for the coffee), so we settled for ordinary coffee and a pudding. No proper apologies but we were rushed out after 2 hours at the table.",

I was fortunate enough to have some foodie coworkers that pointed me to the Ship in Wandsworth. Sure, it's not the most convenient location for someone who's just visiting but public transit is extremely efficient in London and I think it's worth the trip.I had some of the best foie gras pate/chicken liver mousse of my life. Normally, I'm more of a seared foie gras type of girl, but I can go for the pate variety as well, especially when it's nice and smooth and rich and creamy.I also had their pork belly dish which was tender through and through, even the parts that weren't pure fat were still moist and tender and not stringy like some seem to be. Their veal liver was also extremely rich and tender and the cottage pie was nice and hearty. Lastly but not leastly, sticky toffee pudding. I am not a sticky toffee pudding connoisseur. I am in fact not very picky about my sticky toffee pudding at all. So I guess I'm not in a position to say. But I will anyway and I will say that I love sticky toffee pudding and they have it and I enjoyed it.Overall, I guess I'm not an authority on british pubs, but as a tourist helping another tourist, I like the Ship and I have on good british authority that it's a good pub!",

If you're feeling tolerant then you might just enjoy yourself, and the surrounds. Yep, it's by the river - let the girls with the 28 foot long scarves fight for those seats - but the pub itself is decent enough. Given the clientele, I was surprised at the staff; we managed to have some laughs with them and most of them will smirk along with you when a Hooray Henry trips over his girlfriend's scarf.",

    "text": "According to all the other reviews of The Ship on Qype, it's like the second coming in pub form. Other pubs must bow down to it's amazing barbecue, selection of ales and riverside location. All hail The Ship - saviour of South West London pub goers! Having lived in Wandsworth for almost a year, and never having visited The Ship, I thought it best to head on down and see what all the fuss was about. I'm a bit of a cynic, so I was expecting to be hugely disappointed. And expecting to be disappointed probably isn't the best attitude to start a drinking sesh. So, The Ship had to win me over. The location is kinda weird, tucked in behind a McDonalds, next to a building site. But it is next to the river, which is quite nice and takes advantage of this by having a large outdoor area. The outdoor-y bit does seem to be put together in a bit of a strange fashion, on several levels and featuring a little bride (which me and my friends named 'The Complex Bridge System' - for some reason hilarious at the time) which can result in some spillage on the journey back from the bar. But it does give the place some character and there were plenty of places to sit, a bonus on one of the first hot days of the year. There was a good selection of ales, lagers and ciders on offer - perfect for outdoor drinking. The bar staff were quick, nice and easy on the eye, so trips to the bar were never a chore. So, the legendary barbecue. You can smell it from down the road, and it smells GOOD. Portions are bloody huge, served with epic sized sides and fresh from the fire. They are a bit pricey, mind you. On the whole The Ship is an excellent pub. Very likely the best in Wandsworth (I'll update this when I've reviewed all of them) not sure it deserves all the praise being lavished upon it, but it does deserve most of it.",
