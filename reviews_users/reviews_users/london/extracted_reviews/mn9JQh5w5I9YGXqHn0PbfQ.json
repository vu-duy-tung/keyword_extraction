    "text": "Established in 1798, Rules has served traditional English fayre for over 200 years. This warm and inviting restaurant sits snuggly in a back street of London's Covent Garden. The red banquettes and varnished wood detail are complemented by a wealth of treasures adourning the walls of the intimate dining area.From Vanity Fair prints (I had the honour of being seated next to the Prince of Monaco) and exquisite portraits to a collection of game bird prints and mounted antlers. You are transported to a world of English tradition: a mixture of hunting, shooting and fishing, the elegance of the country manor and warm caring atmosphere of the family dining room.In this age of always online connectivity, Rules' no mobile phone policy helps to ensure a relaxed and uninterrupted meal. Even I, a self-diagnosed text junkie, appreciated a break from the constant barrage of beeping, buzzing and vibrating. There is no dress code, however, I would advise a minimum of smart casual. You run the risk of feeling slightly out of place if you arrive in your shorts, t-shirt and flip-flops.I had the pleasure of visiting during the Christmas season. The glistening decorations only added to the snug homely feel. Rules is one of the most flexible and accommodating restaurants around. Perfect for a family meal (well behaved children only please) or a sophisticated get together with some friends. I dined alone (I do have friends but I had left it rather last minute to find a lunch partner). So many restaurants can make lone diners feel very awkward. But not so here. My single table was tucked away but not hidden. Above my seat was a magazine rack with an assortment of today's papers, providing a welcome change from staring as the table cloth (normally I would send a few text messages, but see above for mobile phone policy!)The staff at Rules are helpful and polite and are not over-bearing. I find it extremely annoying to be asked every five minutes whether everything is ok or whether I need anything else. But the waiters provided a well-balanced service, impeccably turned out in traditional uniforms.The menu is bursting with country favourites and nursery classics. The food is kept simple, but the use of fresh, high quality produce makes a very noticeable difference to the taste. I am a very keen proponent of fresh ingredients, locally sourced and packed full of flavour, as opposed to tasteless supermarket pap. And so it seems are Rules. Rules owns The Lartington Estate, Teesdale in the High Pennines, which produces an array of high quality game and meat, which is used in the restaurant.I started my lunch with the Potted Shrimp. This classic of the Afternoon Tea arrived presented with a small salad garnish and some toast. The shrimp was well seasoned, with a peppery after taste, but without overpowering the flavours of the sea. Although the portion looked small - it was just enough to whet my appetite.The main course consisted of roast partridge, with bacon, brussel sprouts and chestnuts. The golden bird arrived in a small copper roasting dish, surrounded by vibrant buttery sprouts and crumbly chestnuts. The partridge was still juicy and succulent and was complimented by its sweet, but not sickly, jus. Presentation is as important element of the eating experience. I was delighted to see the couple at the table in front of me being served their soup at the table from a small silver soup dish, as opposed to arriving ready-plated. These little touches may seem eccentric, but somehow make you appreciate the food more.I finished my lunch with my good friend the apple crumble. Baked and served in an individual ramekin, it provided a substantial portion of my favourite dessert. The Bramleys had a lemony hint to them and were slightly too tart for me (I have a very sweet tooth). The crumble was excellent and was fairly thick (my favourite part of this pudding really - the thicker the better!). The icing sugar garnish would have been better replaced with caster sugar (slightly caramelised).Each course was separated by a comfortable break. At no time did I feel rushed or pressured to give up my table. And after a sumptuous lunch I didn't feel too full or bloated.Traditional, succulent and well-balanced - Dining at Rules is like being at a friend's house for lunch.PS: Rules also do a beef roast with all the trimmings, but this is for a minimum of two persons.",

    "text": "A fantastic London setting is Rules restaurant. Just the most quintessentially English place to eat. It could almost be opened as a museum due to the number of treats pinned on the walls. My girlfriend and I dinned on a Monday late lunch so seemed plenty of room and no apparent rush. I can imagine it gets exceptionally busy. The starters were fine. Goats cheese fritters and Morecombe bay potted shrimps. However, i had forgotten how over-rated and what lack of value potted shrimps were and do prefer them warm as a personal choice. Mains were very nice. Nicely cooked venison with chicory and Victoria plums and a slightly chewy ribeye washed down with a cheap Argentinean red (budget option!!). The side dishes were great. The mash was lovely and the Savoy cabbage was great, if a little expensive at \u00a34.50 \u00a0its only cabbage after all. Puddings were as to be expected, stodgy, but lovely \u00a0spotted dick being the winner. The service was very good, but I reiterate it was quiet so that may have been misleading. Overall, at about \u00a360 ahead, it was ok. The food doesn't compare to Simpson's in the strand, for example, but the restaurant and atmosphere is much more relaxed than the stuff and pomp of Simpson's. Defiantly worth one visit just to experience the whole surroundings.",

    "text": "30 years ago, when I lived in London, I'd walk thru Covent Garden and let the crowds be my entertainment. London was and is expensive. One day I walked past Rules just as a posh looking couple were entering, and I overheard the warm welcome they received from the staff in the Entry.Ah, to have money, I thought, and walked on...Last week at Rules, I received the first-timers equivalent. Clearly 5 stars.Oldest restaurant in London-1795. Second family of owners. Bless all the chefs.This is a wonderful experience. The service is very good to excellent, the offerings were designed to make Careme unhappy. Visit the website and check it out, it's pricey and very meat oriented.Towards the end of our luncheon, a youngish couple came into our room and were seated to my right. They were Americans, I'm a Yank and can spot us quite well, and very underdressed. He looked about the room and look it all in, and there's alot to take in. She looked at the menu and frowned-clear who chose to 'pop' in, poor fellow. All he got was few minutes enjoying himself before she announced loudly \"Let's go\" He looked surprised and tried to talk with her, but she got up and walked out with him bringing up her rear...Staff reset the table. Next!Come here if you've a mind to, come for the history and the pace and what can be, from reading other's comments, unsatisfactory, but in my experience it rocked! Sure, it's British and stuffy, but the staff warms after a while and the chow is fabulous. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Rules Restaurant is truly a place every London visitor should experience. It's one of the oldest restaurants in London and has a rich past as well as an awesome menu. \u00a0This place has been around since 1798! As an American, I've always enjoyed English food. From the traditional English breakfast and oyster puddings to currys and fish 'n chips, English food has always been satisfying and delicious. I was dining alone and was greeted with pomp and circumstance. Very formal wait staff. I was dressed in a suit and would recommend visitors to be dressed their best. The decor was quite interesting with paintings and trinkets. After I was seated, I was half expecting to see the likes of royalty or celebrities. \u00a0I started my meal with Cornish Fish Soup with crab & mullet. It was quite delicious and rich. For the main course I had Beef, Kidney, and Oyster Pudding with mashed potatoes. It was fantastic and the mashed potatoes was the very best I've ever had!The service was extremely formal, but grand. This place truly should be on your bucket list! I must while in London! From their website:\"Rules still flourishes, the oldest restaurant in London and one of the most celebrated in the world.In over 200 years, spanning the reigns of nine monarchs, it has been owned by only three families . . . just before The Great War, Charles Rule, a descendant of the founder, was thinking of moving to Paris; by sheer coincidence he met Tom Bell, a Briton who owned a Parisian restaurant called the Alhambra, and the two men decided to swap businesses. (During the war Tom Bell was an officer in the Royal Flying Corps, and left the running of the restaurant to Charlie, the Head Waiter, who had served Charles Rule for many years.) During the second world war, Rules stayed open but its structure was reinforced with thick wood. It was only open from 1pm to 3pm and offered the compulsory rationed meals at five shillings but could offer copious rabbits, grouse and pheasants which were not rationed. A lady was the Head Waiter during the war. The restaurant could never open on Sundays because it was on Church grounds and could not get a licence.In 1984 Tom Bell's daughter sold Rules to John Mayhew, the present owner. Today Rules seats around 90 people and employs 90 staff.Rules serves the traditional food of this country at its best - and at affordable prices. It specialises in classic game cookery, oysters, pies and puddings.\"",

In fact, I believe it was mentioned in passing on Downton Abbey. The food is also a sort of classic British cuisine... for better or for worse. It's not my taste, but it's done well. I've used this place for business dinners for those visiting from outside of London and it seems to get the job done.",

The meat was tender, juicy, flavorful and have really nice texture. The gravy complimented the meat well as it did not drown out the beef flavor. It is a dish for two to share and comes with green beans , Yorkshire pudding and potatoes which were really good as well. The service was top notch and the host even shared some fun facts and history about Rules being the oldest restaurant in London. Would highly recommend trying it out!",

For all the bad things we Americans hear about English food, this place is one that would change your mind. I had the rack-of-lamb and it was excellent. For dessert, we had pudding and it was to die for. The ambience here was also one-of-a-kind.Ontop of the great food and experience, Judy Dench and Alice Kingsley were sitting across from us.

    "text": "I was very disappointed, first with the reception and then with the meal. As for the maitre d' reception: I presented at 6 PM to arrange a table for later that night. He made a rude face, then haughtily declared that nothing would be available until 10:45. I explained that I would be happy to wait until then, and would return later. He looked surprised that he had not discouraged me, then said begrudgingly that perhaps something would be available by 10:30. I returned at 9 PM, and asked to sit in the lounge where I might have a cocktail while I waited. Once I was settled with my cocktail, I was not surprised that at only 9:15 my table was ready. By 10 PM about a third of the tables were empty and it was obvious that the maitre d' had simply lied about the late table availability. I'm a well dressed and professional woman who dines internationally on a regular basis. He had no reason to try to turn me away other than simple ostentatious rudeness.The meal: Rules appears to have cooks but no chef. I ordered a steak and received a hunk of beef completely unseasoned, slightly overcooked (I ordered medium rare) and completely ungarnished. It was the least appealingly plated steak I've ever had. The waiter then glopped a thick and fairly tasteless sauce on the side of my plate. The beef itself was of good but not outstanding quality. A side of beets in a plain metal bowl were also completely unseasoned. The chips (fried potato wedges) were chewy rather than crisp, with a highly starchy interior, and completely unseasoned. In total, the meal was cooked but bland. So, why 2 stars? One for the bar tender and his excellent scotch cocktail, which was well balanced and generous. One for the decor, which in the end is likely what keeps this otherwise uninspiring restaurant open. It's really too bad, as a more imaginative chef (or at least a pantry that includes a few herbs and spices) could make this a special place worth the currently outrageous price tag.",

I will say the sponge cake and custard was over the top. It was clearly designed by a fat man at 2am. It was out of control. The service was top notch.

Service was great, food was great, and it served as a perfect place to end our vacation. Skip the wine list and go straight for the cocktails. Well balanced cocktails that don't scream \"I have alcohol in me!\" and are crafted with care. I started with a green salad. Not sure it was worth the 9 quid but it was REALLY good. For a main course I had the lamb special with mint sauce. Very nice size portion of the lamb, a little fatty though. The mint sauce cut through the fat and lightened it up a big which was nice. The vegetables were cooked to perfection.I finished my meal with the Blood Orange Parfait. Delicious. Blood Orange Sorbet on a crunchy granola crust, very refreshing and unique. The actual blood oranges on the plate had no flavor, however, could have done without.Prices are not for the shallow pocketed. But, you do get a well cooked meal.A knocked off a star because I think the prices were a little too high, though not by much, and our table for two was, quite literally, slanted.",

    "text": "Opening Remarks:-Opened by Thomas Rule in 1787, making it the oldest restaurant in London.-The restaurant owns Lartington Estate in the High Pennies where a lot of hunting goes down, hence the restaurants' emphasis on game birds, roe deer and Belted Galloway beef-In addition to obviously being a restaurant, Rules offers a Cocktail Masterclass for those interested in learning more about classic mixology-On their website, they feature reviews and letters about Rules submitted by famous people including Nigella Lawson circa 1991Ambiance:-Old school doesn't even begin to describe the room there at Rules- the restaurant has been standing since the 1700s and they apparently have not changed a single thing. There are old photos, paintings and busts on the wall of significant British figures, and an abundance of antlers and other hunting gear all around.-The wooden tables are draped in white linens, but in no way will this resemble the high-end dining experience one may be accustomed to. Seriously, the room is more haunted house than Michelin Star.-There are two private dining rooms (which I popped by head into)-The demographic is largely 70+ wealthy folk who are well dressed and definitely not tourists- with my cute summer dress and my camera strapped around my waist, I stood out like a sore thumb.Service:-Service at Rules is professional to say the least- the mature servers wear white collars and black suits and approached the table with a level of sophistication. Despite the high-brow approach, the servers were surprisingly friendly and laid back. -Water glasses were refilled, cutlery replenished as needed, and the meal moved at a very comfortable lunch time pace - in and out in approximately 1 hourDrinks:-A short list of British cocktails like the Black Velvet (Champagne and Guiness-yikes), and the Kate Middleton (Sipsmith, Pinky Vodka, Lillet, Crystallised Violets, and Rose Petals), with London Pride and Draught Guinness on tap. They also serve wine by the glass and bottle.-We had a long day ahead of us so asked for an off-the-menu unsweetened iced tea, which the chef made for us from scratch.Food:-Old school British with a heavily focus on game meats like Guinea Fowl, quail, rabbit, duck, pigeon, roe deer and more-The menu is divided into Oysters, First Courses, Pies, Mains, Veggies, and Puddings and Cheese-Upon our visit it was Grouse season so they had a separate menu for items featuring this game meat (which I had never tasted before!)Pea & Bacon Soup with Cr\u00e8me Fraiche (7.95)Simple but delicious. Very smooth with deliciously salty bits of bacon and just enough luxurious cr\u00e8me fraiche to smooth it out.Dorset Crab on Toast with Heritage Tomatoes & Herb Mayonnaise (15.95)My favourite savoury dish of the meal- the tomatoes were absolutely stunning, and the crab salad was plentiful and not overly dressed with mayo.Grouse Salad with Watercress, Pickled Giroulles, Blackberries and Cobnuts ( 12.50)I definitely liked the flavour of the gamey grouse with the sweet blackberries, but the meat was unpleasantly overcooked and dry.Potatoes Anna (4.50)Simple and comforting, the potatoes were cooked nicely with a good crispy crust and tender interior, but I found them underseasoned.Treacle Sponge Pudding with Custard & Clotted Cream (7.95)Wow. I am so glad I finally got to try treacle because I am officially obsessed. It is a lot like a sticky toffee pudding, but brighter, lighter and sweeter, the pudding had a fabulous citrus flavour to counteract the sweet sticky treacle. Topped off with a generous pour of custard to cut some of that sugar, and I was one happy girl.Closing:-65 including tax and tip ($106 Canadian) - very expensive considering we thought we had eaten relatively light.-While it's certainly not a place I would ever see myself as a regular, I am glad I checked it out for the old school British experience.",

    "text": "First off: if you go make reservations online. \u00a0You'll get an email that you might be tempted to ignore, thinking it's just an automatic confirmation... which it is, but it also tells you when you have to leave your table and that you need to reply to confirm your reservation at least 24 hours in advance.In short: the staff isn't worth it.So after a phenomenal experience at Amsterdam's oldest restaurant I decided to check out London's oldest restaurant, too, thinking this would be a nice little tradition wherever I travel. \u00a0Wrong. \u00a0Live and learn. \u00a0The food was good (if overpriced, but I was okay with that), the place was lovely, but the service had a bit to be desired. \u00a0It's obvious the restaurant wants to pride itself on being classy, but don't do what it takes to fully get there. \u00a0The staff was not friendly or genuinely kind, and a bit standoffish. \u00a0After I ordered a main course (that cost 30 pounds) the waiter asked if I wanted a starter. \u00a0I said no, but he pointed to some anyway, and told me that the meal took 40 minutes to make. \u00a0I told him that was fine and I would drink my wine until then. \u00a0Of course, the small meal only took about 15 minutes to arrive and I did not appreciate the obvious up-sell. \u00a0It was delicious but small, which again I was okay with, but if I'm paying for an overpriced small meal I expect the staff add to the experience, not detract from it. \u00a0Also I noticed that they only had male servers, which didn't sit right with me in this day and age.I would have been happier in a traditional pub with friendly people. \u00a0Live and learn. \u00a0And only go to De Silveren Spiegel in Amsterdam when I'm in the mood for an upscale yet cozy dining experience with service second to none.",

Well then don't fret - just head over to Rules!I was in London on business with a colleague and Rules stood out to us because it is London's oldest restaurant. Like a bunch of self-important Americans, of course we were underdressed, but the staff sat us immediately and were very courteous regardless.They were having a steak special - I forget the exact name - but it was a special type of beef that they only got on occassion. I went for it and was glad I did, it was very delicious.The bottom line is that this place screams old school gentleman's London. Classy staff who are very courteous, excellent wine, and scrumptuous food prepared masterfully. The doorman in the tails was a very nice touch. I hope to visit this place again for a special dinner next time I am in Jolly Ole'.",

    "text": "Dining at Rules feels a bit like being transported back to a bygone era (as in the fantasy rose-tinted version, rather than how things probably really were for most people in the 1800s).It's not hard to imagine having just stepped out of your carriage as the doorman opens the door and sweeps you in from the cold to be cloistered in a velvet covered booth beneath the antlers and copious wall ornaments. The oldest restaurant in London is literally steeped in history and it's all on display. The waiter was happy to discuss and explain the various pictures adorning the walls and encouraged a little tour around on the way to the bathroom to get a good look at everything, which was nice.With so much effort invested in the venue, one might fear the food wouldn't come up to par, but it so did! \u00a0For lunch I went for the blade of beef with bone marrow and parsley mash, which was melt in your mouth delicious. And the pies, particularly the steak and kidney pie, were also extremely good, with a thin pastry crust filled with proper meat and accompanied by a rich gravy. Rules is exclusively supplied beef from the Gilmonby herd of pedigree Belted Galloways farmed in the north-east near the Pennines, where they also own Lartington Hall Park estate from which their game is sourced. So that accounts for the quality of the meat.You need to order some sides of vegetables to go with the dishes, and the green beans were cooked perfectly with a bit of crunch still. And everything got washed down with a rather lovely bottle of Saint-\u00c9milion selected from a decently ranging wine list (particularly if you have a preference for French).The choux pastry dessert with creme patissiere, praline & almonds was so light it felt like no effort to eat it all, and it looked exquisite as well. The warm chocolate fondant was also just right, with a hint of mint to take the edge off the richness. It's necessary to book ahead as it was a full lunch service on a Saturday, although there is the option of eating the same menu upstairs in the cocktail bar, which wasn't busy. Throughout the meal the service was attentive without being intrusive but it was a long and relaxed lunch at two and a half hours (although didn't drag - it had just the right balance), so be prepared to take your time, sit back and enjoy it. The cocktail bar looked like the kind of inviting place you could easily lose an entire evening, so certainly something to go back for!",

    "text": "Very mediocre! It is rare that I give so few stars, but this place is awful and highly overrated. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one is because the dessert was actually pretty good (the only plus from the whole night). First they run out of the Kate Middleton cocktail, apparently didn't have one of the ingredients. Then the salad with partridge was bland and not seasoned, just overall underwhelming. The worst was the mains. First the accidentally send our food to the table next to us. They stare at it for about 10 minutes. And then the waiter apologizes and places the food they have been breathing on for a good 10 minutes in front of us. It didn't look touched, but who really knows. It was impossible to get the waiters attention, hence the other couple having to breathe over our food for so long. The waiter highly recommended the hare for main course, said it was his favorite so I thought why not give it a shot. It was inedible!!! Dry, no flavor, just awful. This place does not know a thing about service or good food. And it is definitely a tourist trap that unfortunately my fianc\u00e9 and I fell into. I work with British ppl and half of them have never even heard of it. And those that have say it's a tourist trap and have never been themselves and never plan on going. Save your time and money and go somewhere else.",

To name a few, Charles Dickens, William Makepeice, and Rules has appeared in several books. I came here for an english tea, and actually really enjoyed my time here. Sure it has its slightly private school nature about it, and you imagine someone shouting ' Jolly Hockey Sticks!' but for me, that all adds to the quintessentially english experience. Nothing to be ridiculed, more like a classic book which is to be savoured over a malt whiskey.",

Best way to experience english fare (game) - never had anyone cook it more traditionally or better. Downside you might end up with a permanent pout and nose in the air and become a statistic of the federal bail out plan.

They have wonderfully traditional accompaniments such as cream spinach, au gratin potato's sauteed green beans, bake potatos and Yorkshire pudding which I adore! The first time my husband and I went to Rule's, we were with another couple so we shared sticky toffee dessert that was amazing! Now I order my own and if for some crazy reason can't finish it, I bring it back to the hotel for a snack!

We were staying nearby at the Waldorf Hilton and the concierge mentioned Rules as a nice restaurant for dinner. We did not have reservations on a Sunday night, but we decided we could always just have a few cocktails and relax while we waited for our table. When we arrived we were escorted upstairs to a cozy little corner table. We had great drinks (including 1 very strong cocktail with Absinthe in it) and then headed back downstairs for dinner about 40 minutes later. I ordered a fish entree that was delicious and my boyfriend had the most delicious lamb chops! (and I normally do not like any lamb) The dish was accompanied by a delightful fresh mint sauce! Nothing like the fake mint jelly/sauces you sometimes see. This is a elegant but comfortable and cozy restaurant with great service and great food! I would elaborate more on the food, but I was quite tipsy after that absinthe cocktail and the details of dinner are a bit blurred in my memory. I do know that I will return to this restaurant next time I am in London and would highly recommend it. Also - it is the oldest restaurant in London, which added a fun, historical element to the experience.",

I explained that the reservation was for 7:30 and offered to show her the Opentable confirmation (I had reconfirmed earlier in the day over the phone to make absolutely sure), but she declined and repeated \"The reservation is at 8:00\". Not \"sorry, we have the reservation down for 8pm. We must have made a mistake; why don't you have a free drink in the bar?\", which would be standard procedure in any nice-ish restaurant worth its salt. No attempt at contrition or apology- she seemed to go out of her way to avoid apologizing at all costs.Couldn't really complain so early in the night, and the rest of the meal was good enough to forget about that encounter.

My dad had the fish of the day and my sister ordered a roasted pork dish. \u00a0I'm more difficult to please in such places since I'm a vegetarian, but I managed with a nice salad and a side of roasted root vegetables. \u00a0For traditional English fare, everyone was pretty satisfied with what they ordered. \u00a0But far and away the best gastronomic part of the meal was the pudding. \u00a0We ordered the chocolate souffle and the sticky toffee pudding... the souffl\u00e9 was fine, but the sticky toffee pudding was a mass of melting golden caramel divinity - definitely came very close to some of the best sticky toffee pudding I've ever had.Maybe this is all a little over-the-top for native Brits, but we really enjoyed it - and there were enough businessmen in the place that also seemed to be appreciating the attentive service and traditional fare. \u00a0There's something very celebratory about the atmosphere here... it's certainly not the type of place you would take a date, but would be an excellent choice if you were toasting a graduation with your parents or wanted to mark some other similar monumental event. \u00a0After all, I believe the polished and traditional experience that Rules delivers may very well be the reason it became an institution for so many notable people over so many generations.",

I chose this restaurant because I heard it was baby-friendly, something that is few and far between at white tablecloth restaurants in London! We ate here while on vacation with our five month old (at the earliest dinner seating) and the food and service were top notch! The decor was entertaining/stimulating for our baby, and the Yorkshire Pudding and Spotted Dick met our expectations for old-fashioned authentic British fare. Would go back again!",

We are 2 people and in the middle of the afternoon just wanted to chillax with a bottle of wine and some cheese and gravlax. We ordered 2 starters and 2 cheese plates and a bottle of Pinot blanc that would have costed us over 150\u00a3 each! After ordering and waiting 15 mins to get our food, the manager comes to us and says that we have obligatory to get a main course each! It would even have been less costly to do so, but we wanted cheese and gravlax and we not interested in a main course at 3pm since we just had lunch before!!! We had to leave the restaurant because they would not serve us what we wanted to eat! Seems like there's way too many \"Rules\" in that restaurant. That's a terrible business!",

When I came to London for my junior (third) year abroad during my BA, my dad constantly pestered me to visit Rules. I did not. Then I came back five years later to study my MA in London. My dad constantly pestered me to visit Rules. I did. When my mom came to visit me here. And picked up the check.And I'm glad we went.I felt similarly to Michael D. - Rules is not my typical kind of place, but it was much enjoyed. It is a delightful mix of upscale stuffy and quirky English with a great interior. English through and through, oh yes. And definitely delicious, not in spite of its Englishness, but because of it! Mom had the Caesar salad to start, a glass of white, and the fish pie. Smelled so smokey and delicious I wished I had ordered it. I enjoyed roasted pheasant and a glass of red. It was all marvelous and we didn't even have room for dessert!",

    "text": "100th review of London's oldest restaurant.----------------------------------I had never been to Rules in all the time that I lived in London in the 1990s. I had never even heard of it. I suppose I was young and didn't go to places like this in my 20s. Probably I would not have even had a place like this on my radar.For our 5th wedding anniversary I took my wife to London and chose Rules for the anniversary dinner. The world always puts British food as a butt of a joke. They mark it as bland and overcooked, but the truth is that when done well, though simple, can stand on its own against any cuisine. Rules is the best example of this.We walked over from our hotel that sat below Trafalgar Square, though Covent Garden and on to Maiden Lane where Rules is located. Rules is not your typical restaurant. It cannot be put into a box as one thing. It is both formal and casual-quirky and traditional. It is all that is British through and through.I brought my own bottle of wine, which they do not like and charge a \u00a325 corkage fee for, but I had chosen the wine five years earlier for this specific night and was not going to deviate from my plan. They have a great wine list, and I probably would have done better, as far as pairing, if I had used their sommelier.I started dinner with the Foie Gras Terrine with apricot & toast and Ting had a half dozen Duchy of Cornwall Rock Oysters. The Foie Gras was rich and buttery, like silk if it could melt. The oysters tasted of the dark, cold, salty sea and could not have been fresher.My main course was Scallops with Braised Pork Cheeks, carrot & ginger, and hers the Fillet of Sea Bass with white beans, summer vegetables & a light basil broth. Both were magnificent. My scallops were sweet and tender and the cheek separated at the touch of the fork. The bass was flavorful and perfectly cooked. The vegetables and broth that accompanied it were subtle and delicious.We both have a sweet tooth and I love English desserts. We shared two-the Sticky Toffee Pudding with caramelised walnuts and the Apple & Blackberry Crumble with custard. Both were exactly as they should be-toothsome and traditional.By far the best part of the evening was sitting across from my beautiful wife of five years and telling her that they were the best of my life._____",

Founded in 1798, the decor, the ambiance is so -different- from anything I've ever been to.I'm a bit of a dreamer, and I found myself wondering what it was like, when it opened. Pale women, curly hair framing their face, in their fashionable empire gowns, comfortable, laughing. And their partners, men with short hair, sideburns, carrying their hats as they led their ladies in. It's a thing of wonder to feel the ghosts of generations pass through you when you enter a restaurant - not literal ghosts, of course, but just - hearing the laughter and the warmth that once was. It's not hard to imagine - the floor, the ceiling (oh, the ceiling!) can be stared at for hours. Compared to the feeling you get by being here, the food is nearly inconsequential - but it is solid, good British food. I would've really liked for their to have been a cod option with the fish and chips, but the haddock was still quite nice. This place is only slightly pricey, but not pricey compared to the ambiance and the joy of having eaten here. I've definitely paid more for a burger in the USA. Going to Rules should be a rule!

The meat was cooked wonderfully, it had the perfect smoky and crispy texture on the outside, very moist and tender from the inside and really well seasoned. Deseret of rum Baba was also a winner, the aroma of the rum was defined. It had the perfect balance of bitter sweetness and I especially enjoyed the black cardamom, which it really lifted up the warmth spice element on the plate without being too dominating, it was indeed a very fine winter pudding.",

The first person we encountered at check in began to argue with me about the two reservations I made and not listening to what I was saying and trying to explain. They have limited tables for large groups so call to reserve a table for 6 and don't make separate reservations. Even though they say they cancel them, I not having seen this on their website, was able to confirm both over the phone as they require it 24 hours in advance. After diffusing this man's anger he was able to accommodate us at two tables next to one another which is what I was trying to explain I wanted and what I was told to do when I confirmed our reservation. If it hadn't been my husband's desire to dine here for his birthday we would have left given the circumstances. Wow ere there on March 9th.",

However I think it relies more on it's reputation now than the food itself. We had starters which were excellent, game terrine, potted shrimp and a game broth. They were all well prepared and delivered by an immaculately attired waiter. The main course however, could have been better, The roast beef, their special was a little too well done, and the amount that you receive is a little lacking, especially when compared to the vegetables provided. The Yorkshire pudding was overdone as well. The horseradish was delivered in a huge spoonful for my plate though, slightly overdoing it as I didn't even eat half.The lamb was similarly received but the partridge was loved by the recipient. No room left for dessert however so we skipped it and went upstairs to look at the bar, one of the oldest around and very ornate. Not needing another drink, we headed for the entrance, picked up our jackets, were bid goodbye by the doorman and headed off into the evening.",

Pies overflowing the with gravy, everything is bountifuland steaming hot with hushed tones and austere dining with wonderful wait staff. It's been 4 yrs since I have been here and I repent. I repent for sending anyone to this horrific place. The food was disgusting. The steak and kidney pie is better bought at Waitrose and heated in the oven. The kidneys were grey bullets, the gravy non existent and the greens were saut\u00e9ed in garlic !! Has this chef been to a canteen in England ?? The pigeon was good but it sat on a bed of ... Watercress with Parma ham with mustard blobs and balsamic reduced liquid ??? Again, has this chef even visited an English kitchen ?? Or is this 2005??? And the cherry on top was the server. God knows it's not his fault. He has been trained by some orangutan of a manager.The gratuity was included in the bill which, I questioned and his delightful answer, in his foreign accent was \"in London, you see always\". As someone who grew up in London England, this was absolute rot and obscene!! How rude !!! How dare he say this to a paying customer especially when the receipt says specifically that it is not compulsory and can be removed at request. I was devastated. My childhood treat has been ruined on this terrible night. I will tell all my foreign friends visiting what a tourist trap this has become. The portraits on the walls were all weeping for the good old days, ashamed of what this has become. It was recovered however when i went to St John's in Smithfields and had a delicious dessert straight after. Their bill certainly did NOT have the gratuity on it and it was wonderful as always.",

No, the restaurant was not full. \u00a0Staff kept looking at us with a sour expression whenever we were able to flag them down. When we were leaving, table next to us noticed my nephew and said how well behaved he was. \u00a0I told them about our experience and they empathized by saying the staff could \"Sod off.\"Restaurant should indicate that families with children are not welcome.

It was established in 1794 complete with tons of stories about the royals and celebrities surrounding the establishment. There's actually a secret entrance for the royal family as well as a private club to be invited too. The walls are decorated with photos, paintings, clocks, etc. from over the years. The atmosphere was elegance left over from the days gone by. And, the food was divine!I ordered the Kate Middleton 29 signature drink to start with before switching to wine with my father. Absolutely amazing. We had course after course including filet, crab cake salad, and plenty of options for dessert. I highly recommend the experience!",

    "text": "Many Yelp reviewers point out that this restaurant often advises they have promised your table to another guest by a certain time and seem slightly, if not completely put off by this. This is part of managing a busy restaurant and honoring reservations. If they walk in and can get a table, they're lucky! And if they had made reservations and were required to wait, they might be even more incensed. So get over it.Rules is gorgeous. Wood, tile, fireplaces, plush draperies, framed art, cut-up cozy spaces and loads of history. For this, I would gladly return. The Maitre 'd was polite and accommodating. The service adequate. The food--Veal and Morel Pie for lunch--delicious! I would ask that patrons not take children here, unless they are consistently well-behaved in public. The quarters are close and this is the kind of place you want to feel is special.",

All was delicious! \u00a0Clearly, my somewhat low opinion of traditional British food was formed by eating at all the wrong places! \u00a0All of our salads (green and a beet/goat cheese) were as fresh and crisp as could be and perfectly dressed. \u00a0Our \"main\" courses (daube of beef, the rabbit hot pot, and the wild boar pie) were simply out of this world delicious! \u00a0And the wine....oh the wine. \u00a0Perfectly paired, and perfectly French.Overall a very nice experience with excellent food and wine and a pleasant, if reserved, wait staff. \u00a0Next time I find myself in London looking for a quiet, relaxed place to dine I will know exactly where to go.(PS I marked this restaurant as \"not good for kids\" despite the fact that our 10 year old son enjoyed his meal and experience. \u00a0He is an unusual boy with lots of dining experiences under his belt and incredibly good restaurant manners and presence. \u00a0If yours are the same, then by all means bring them!)",

My daughter put this on her \"fancy places list that she has been to\" Yes it is one of the oldest restaurants on London and has an air of English pomp and circumstance \u00a0with it's old world theme and decor which is probably the same decor from when it first opened.I have read a few reviews that state the waiters are rude and that the people believe that they experienced racism and/or elitism. Yes they have a strict dress code as many fine establishments in the US and other countries have. Yes you need to behave like a gentleman or gentlelady and not like a yahoo. This is why people want to come here and feel like they are in sophisticated establishment. If you want to wear shorts or yell at a TV whilst your football club loses a match then go to one of the many pubs close by.We were treated extremely well, the wait staff were all great, respectful, helpful and made us all laugh. I'm not sure where some of these negative reviews are coming from.Anyway the food was fantastic and made our first night in London memorable. All the recommendations from our waiter was spot on including the steak, haunch of lamb and rabbit. He even picked us out a great wine. I actually wanted to come here because they are supposed to have a great Beef Wellington. Alas, we found out that it must be ordered 24-48 hours in advance and it is for four people. I guess we will have to preorder when we next visit London.Of note: They were very accommodating, I had made reservations weeks ago for the first night we were to be in London, 6pm reservations as I figured we would be tired flying all day, unfortunately we missed our connection flight and could not make it. I emailed them from the airport to let them know, when we got there the next day they were able to squeeze us in the night we got in at 9pm.We will defiantly be back!",

A gratuity was also added at the end of our meal, there was only 3 of us. It was also very odd since the European system is not at all similar to an American system where large gratuity is expected or added to large parties, again 3 of us. We absolutely had that shit taken off, then this asshole basically hovered over our table while we paid. I don't know if management reads or cares about reviews or is even aware of technology since it's \"the oldest in London\" but this theme of crass behavior is not unfamiliar after reading other reviews. Definitely felt hostility from the waiter, only him not the rest of the staff, and it seemed racially motivated. Waiter still a dick.",

Fish soup to start. My companions had a mixture of Pork, Duck and so on. And the puddings! We shared a Sticky Toffee Pudding and a Golden Syrup Pudding. Heaven.

    "text": "Summary: Would leave 0 stars if I could. Don't go here. Rules has an incredibly racist and elitist atmosphere, and the food isn't anywhere near the quality to make up for it.--The oldest restaurant in London reeks with the same old attitudes of racism, classism, and elitism during its founding time of 1798. Unless there's drastic change to address the exclusionary nature of this restaurant, if you're young, not white, and want to enjoy traditional British cuisine, I would recommend taking your business elsewhere. Hopefully the current, and I directly quote from the website, \"rakes, dandies and superior intelligence's who comprise its clientele\" keeping the restaurant in business dies off soon.I made a reservation at 6pm from Bon Appetit's recommendation. I was very excited to share the rib of beef for two with my partner, and introduce my parents to the restaurant's history. My mother is a Chinese historical fiction writer and my father an avid photographer, so I thought it was a match made in heaven. We had come in after a fun, long day at the ZSL London Zoo, and had forgotten about the no-shorts policy stated in our email reservation. London has been unnaturally warm these past few days, and as Yankees who are used to cold drinks and air-conditioning on hot summer days, we weren't exactly focused on wearing trousers for the whole day. When we arrived at the restaurant, the doorman immediately looked my boyfriend up and down and crisply said that they have a strict no-shorts policy. My partner immediately felt humiliated and meekly told me that he would be fine going back to our hotel to change. I stood my ground, and luckily the doorman's colleague informed us that they had a spare set of trousers on hand. My boyfriend is 6'0, and the first pair of trousers that he got didn't fit him. I had to ask again for a second set. The most insulting situation was, after that entire ordeal, once he sat at the table, his legs were covered by the floor length white table cloth. Having grown up in a British International environment, I'm not new to strict dress codes, which is already rooted in classism, but if you are trying to cultivate a standardized type of clientele aesthetic, at least have a purpose to the madness. For example, London's J-Sheekey has a no-shorts policy as well, but at the very least, they have outside seating and mid-length table cloth.Our orderDrinks- A bottle of Domaine Rossignol-Fevrier Bourgogne Pinot Noir - \u00a349.00- Draught Guiness - \u00a36.25Comments: The wine was mediocre; looking it up, the average price is usually \u00a317, so this was my bad for not doing more research. However, take the almost x3 markup however you'd like. Starters- Oysters: two each of Jersey Rock, Morecambe Bay, and Ostra Regal. - \u00a318.50 total- Dorset Crab Salad - \u00a317.95Comments: Starters were fresh enough. However, the plates were very much unceremoniously dumped onto our table with very little explanation. As well as this, when we were ordering and inquired further about the differences between the oysters (e.g. size, flavor), she told us that there was little difference between them, besides the Jersey Rock, which would be saltier. Probably one of the saddest and least detailed explanations of oysters I've ever heard. Rules proudly states, \"as we are confronted with so much mediocrity... when everyone is deluged with homogeneous brands, we like to create the special.\" Not sure if the definition of special has changed to inadequate, but it seems Rules believes so.Mains- Roast Squab Pigeon - \u00a329.95- Rib of Beef for Two - \u00a335.95Comments: Mains were also fine. Yorkshire pudding was underseasoned in its bake. Meat was also underseasoned, but we were provided rock salt, pepper, gravy, and horseradish sauce. I've never been a fan of having to season my own food with salt and pepper, preferring the chef to do it for me, but I do understand that some do prefer that. To be honest, I've had better Yorkshire pudding in America at House of Prime Rib, which is concerning. Cut of meat was lackluster. Since there was a 2 hour limit for our reservation, and we finished our courses with 15 minutes to spare, we were strongly discouraged from ordering dessert, which added even more unpleasantness. However, at this point, we were just ready to leave. I usually don't write long, arduous reviews for restaurants, especially negative ones. But this has by far been one of the most disappointing restaurants I've ever been to. There's a reason why, even after over two centuries of operations, Rules still has yet to have a single Michelin star. Before I came to the restaurant, I believed the prestigious history of past diners' would be reflected in the quality of service and food. Now I feel their attendance can be explained away to not having a better option back then. But hey, there's better now elsewhere. The uptight Rules need to be left behind.",

We mainly only ordered bread because it was suggested and they told us our food would take at least 45 minutes to prepare. It was also a little stuffy inside the restaurant. For the price I didn't feel like it was worth all the money we spent. The food was good but not amazing.",

    "text": "As one of the oldest existing restaurants in London, I've long considered Rules a \"must\" on any trip to the UK. \u00a0I've been perhaps a dozen times over the last five or six years...though my most recent visit may well be my last.Normally, their charming period decor and usually deliciously unusual game-oriented menu make them a truly unique dining experience, even in a world-class city like London.Where else can you find excellent \"delicacies\" like potted hare, pheasant breast, wild duck, grouse, and similar English fare? \u00a0Alas, Rules' weak point is rarely culinary; it is customer-service. \u00a0Or lack thereof. \u00a0A restaurant of the usual quality, and certainly price of Rules, should never inflict *any* the following on customers...much less all in one sitting.Here are some highlights, and some tips for the management:- Note: the only table available on the night was for 11PM. \u00a0A bit late, but the place is indeed popular.- This assumed popularity made it rather confusing to learn that, including our table...a total of three others were occupied. - We were promptly seated at 11PM. \u00a0And promptly rushed through almost every step of the experience. \u00a0We paid our bill barely an hour later, at 12:05AM.- For a restaurant of the quality and price of Rules, a customer should never feel rushed, or as if they are being timed by a stopwatch. \u00a0Nor should a customer receive such clear and unambiguous signals from the staff amounting to \"Hurry it up, the staff would like to go home.\"- I can understand if a restaurant, for whatever reason, prefers an early or inflexible closing time, such as midnight. \u00a0But if that is indeed the case, no reservations or tables should be offered past, say, 10PM. \u00a0- If you want your customers gone by 12 midnight, and intend to begin loudly cleaning dishes, turning on all the bright lights, and reminding your customers that the bar and kitchen will close in 15 minutes...then, for heaven's sake, don't offer an 11PM seating. \u00a0Pure insanity.- Make certain you have enough food for an 11PM seating. \u00a0By the time we arrived, a solid 50%+ of the game menu was sold-out and unavailable.The food we had was indeed fantastic; at least as far as I can recall from the speed at which we needed to order and consume it.Despite the great setting and cuisine...on this night as customers, we were made to clearly feel as if we were interfering with, or delaying, the staff's other plans for the night.And that's just not acceptable.",

The restaurant features a genuine British menu, although the service was a bit slow. The food was solid, although not outstanding. \u00a0The sticky toffee pudding was pretty amazing. The fog salad and cold tomato soup were also very good. \u00a0Knowing that one is present at the oldest existing restaurant in London is cool, although the history of such is diminished somewhat when one peers across the street to see a combination barbecue and crawfish establishment. Our waiter told us a great story about the mural painted on the wall of Margaret Thatcher at the Falkland Islands . Since the Ma\u00eetre d had never heard the story, it is hard to say whether it is true or not. \u00a0Ask your waiter about it and make your own decision.",

There aren't many places you can visit these days where the staff will do - practically - everything they can to make you feel like you are not only going to get a special evening, but that you are actually valued. This place was like eating on a movie set in 1920. It was a throwback in the best of ways. We had been warned to come well dressed but found the rest of the people dinning were not exactly so prepared. All the same, due to a tube strike we arrived very late. A few calls along the way assured our table was still there upon our arrival on a very busy night. The staff was never hovering but it was never more than a few moments before they appeared to top off a glass, sweep crumbs, ask if we needed more of anything. They were amazing. Specializing in game and traditional English food I went with the slow cooked beef cheeks, Game soup and sticky toffee pudding. All of it was tremendous. The better half had the dressed crab and bacon wrapped monkfish which was one of the best served versions of this fish I've ever had. Pricey - but worth it. Romantic and at times loud - but in every way wonderful. For a walk back in time, dine at Rules.",

    "text": "For photos see greedydiva.blogspot.com/\u2026  So, back in May when we still thought 23 degrees was \"hot\", Mama and Papa Diva came to visit me in London. Having moved to the other side of the world, forcing them to fly wedged in a plane for 24 hours all the way from Australia to visit me now and then, the least I could do was show them around some decent restaurants. I couldn't have them accidentally wandering into Bella Italia. In my excitement, I also baked them a lemon drizzle cake. But that's another story. In between cups of tea at home and polite samplings of my attempts to proximate Mama Diva's cooking prowess, we made day trips to Oxford and Brighton (where our random food findings left a bit to be desired, but the change of scenery was very nice). However, London was where I really hit my straps. Breakfast at The Wolseley was a hit (and certainly better than semi-burnt toast at my place overlooking Prowlers). Pre-theatre dinner at The Ivy was as terrific as always and \"Holding the Man\" at Trafalgar Studios is hilarious (and tear fest inducing - which is also quite embarrassing when you're in one of the front rows and still sobbing mercilessly in the faces of the cast as they take their bows) - although possibly not one to see with your parents unless they're as cool as mine and you all get a bit intoxicated first. We toddled up the road to Dean Street Townhouse one night, and although I prefer the noisier, clattering part around the bar, Mama and Papa Diva seemed to appreciate the quieter room on the side where we were seated in big, comfy chairs and more spacious, decadent surrounds. Perhaps a nice relief from the poky and noisy \"character\" of Chez Greedy. But I think the most parent-impressing place on our agenda was Rules. We saved it for our last night on the town together, and it was all fairly fabulous. Established in 1798 by Thomas Rules, Rules claims to be London's oldest restaurant. I haven't verified this, but it looks like they might be right. There's lots of old people not smiling in photos cluttered along the walls and beady eyeballs staring down from stuffed birds crammed in every cranny. It's probably not the best place for staunch vegetarians. Furnishings are rich, plush, dark and comfortable. Despite the clutter, it feels special and luxurious. Rules specialises in ultra traditional British food - there's lots of gamey stuff and potted things, with rich, wintery puddings to finish you off. It's all totally old school. My venison loin with pear, roast chicory and spiced ruby plums was decadently rich and super-gamey (\u00a326.95). Every bite was a luxury. Mama and Papa Diva both enjoyed the rather large grilled sirloin steaks with chips, bearnaise, roasted tomato and mushroom (\u00a322.50). We're still talking about the puddings to whoever will listen - sensational. Little Sister Diva back in Melbourne has since blocked us from her Facebook account. I had some kind of strawberry tart in a shortbread pastry while Mama Diva had a delicate strawberry souffle, both of which were absolutely divine. Papa Diva had ice-cream, which was never going to compete, but the choice had to be expected from a man who would choose a Ginger Snap biscuit over a Chocolate Royal. (All around \u00a37.50) Despite fearing it might be stuffy and overpriced (based on a peering through the windows on past occasions), service was close to perfect - attentive, helpful, friendly, not overly fussy. Sure, it's a bit pricey, but for me it's a special occasion place (like oh, it's Wednesday) and worth every penny. The bar upstairs also looks rather tempting and I hear they make a good cocktail. Rules has 3 new fans. Traditional, straightforward food, cooked well in charismatic surrounds. You won't find anywhere like it anywhere else.",

    "text": "Gives whole new meaning to the term \"history\" \u00a0It's hard to comprehend that Rules has been around almost as long as the United States has been a country. \u00a0Started in 1798.1798!!Not a whole lotta places can brag about that.Rules knows this and takes great pride in letting everyone know it as well. \u00a0To tell the truth though, I don't blame 'em for bragging just a little. \u00a0If I owned something almost as old as dirt itself, I'd brag too.Rules specializes in game cookery.What's game cookery, you ask?Well, it's when you shoot sumthin' and cook it up.In America, game cookery occurs in places like Alabama and Mississippi where folks shoot critters like possum, squirrel, and... other folk.In England, game cookery is much more civilized. \u00a0Rules apparantly owns some pristine hunting grounds in the High Pennies fittingly named, Lartington Estate. \u00a0If you so desire, you could even reserve some time at Lartington Estate and shoot yourself up some critter for your own version of game cookery. \u00a0Personally, I prefer that Rules does the cooking.The menu's intriguing, stuff you rarely see in the states like pheasant, rabbit, snipe, grouse, and such. \u00a0Rules tries hard to keep it old school and very traditional in every aspect. \u00a0From the old-world dining room with mounted deer horns and stuffed animal heads, to the classic fruit accompaniments and condiments served with your meal.This place has got a huge novelty factor, but there is definitely an element of uniqueness about both the surroundings and your food. \u00a0After all, it isn't everyday you tuck into a \"potted rabbit with mulled scrumpy apple chutney\" or a \"steak, kidney, and ale pudding\". \u00a0Even better, the menu warns diners that the occasional buckshot might still be found in your dinner, so eat carefully.The food's surprisingly good. \u00a0The kitchen does have some skill as game meat is difficult to cook well and maintain tenderness because it's so lean.My main complaint was service. \u00a0Our server was gruff and unhelpful. \u00a0When I asked him if there was anything outstanding he would recommend, his answer was, \"everything on the menu is fine.\" \u00a0He then took our order and proceeded to ignore us the rest of the evening.Throughout our meal, there was a distinct sense of urgency. \u00a0Usually when I eat, it's because I'm lactose intolerant. \u00a0But at Rules, urgency occurs because management sets a 2-hour time limit on your table and tells you up front when they need it back. \u00a0This was a major turn-off.To spite Rules, wifey and I took our time and dawdled at our table until the very last minute. \u00a0To sum it up: tasty critters, crappy service.Rules.",

    "text": "WOW. I might have just found the best cocktails in London. I'm a bit blown away actually. Rules is a bit of an institution in London. The resturant is the oldest in London (I think) and dates back to 1798. Of course, I didn't come here for the food (although looking at the rest of the reviews, and judging by my hangover, I really should have), I came for celebration cocktails. I might live here. Brian Silva is a cocktail legend, and the very short list of cocktails is fantastic. All different, like nothing you've veer tried before, and constantly changing. They're at the \u00a311-12 mark, so they're not something I'll ever be able to have every week, but they're fabulous. The champagne and pear cocktail I had was amazing. It was actually real champagne, and very yummy indeed. But the real gem was the 'Chorus Girl', which introduced me to the wonderful world of Frangelico. I've never had a cocktail that tastes of sweet French pastry before. It was a bit like sex in a glass. The friendly barmaid summed it up perfectly when she said \"you want to eat your ice cubes, don't you?\". I did. Fabulous cocktails, perfectly old school British decor and not at all 'Covent Garden-y'. This bar feels like a little secret (you have to go in through the restaurant), I really really hope it stays that way.",

Despite having to seat under a scary wall painting showing Margaret Thatcher - the artist certainly must have disagreed strongly with her politics -, we enjoyed the evening a lot. Also a plus that they had at least one English white wine on their list (a Bacchus from Chapel Down vineyards). All too often, restaurants in England rely only on foreign products when it comes to wine, which is a shame. One point to note, however: We booked the table over their internet site about 10 days in advance (which worked well), and on the booking confirmation we were told that we could have the table only for 2 hours and that it would be needed afterwards. No objections against this, because we were informed immediately after the booking, and we would have to leave at that time anyway; but the restaurant was not full at this late afternoon, and I have the impression that they, by principle, seem to arrange reservation into \"2-hour-slots\". This means that if you want to have the freedom of staying longer than that, make it clear at the booking for how long you will need the table.",

    "text": "When I learned I would be studying in London for three and a half months, there was one place I knew I had to go to no matter what: Rules. I made a reservation just for myself because, alas, none of my fellow study abroad students were willing to shell out pounds for a meal they probably wouldn't like anyway. When I arrived, I affirmed the fact that this was the fanciest restaurant I had been to (this is back in 2006 when I was just breaking onto the dining scene.) I was addressed as \"mademoiselle\" (isn't this an English place?) and had my coat gently removed from my shoulders and carried off by a smartly dressed host. I was then led to a table with a seat for one person. It was nestled in a comfortable corner, and had an adorable selection of British newspapers above my head (because a single diner needs SOMETHING to do.) Since I didn't want to spend all of my money, I decided to be pretty conservative and only get an entree and dessert. As I waited and sipped my bottled water (be careful about specifying tap or else you'll be spending an extra four pounds) I looked around me. Men as far as the eye can see, and all very masculine. Business-like, buddy buddy. I saw a few couples, but groups of men dominated the restaurant. That being said, I was the only all-female party in the space.Then the food arrived. I decided to have the steak and kidney pudding, because it seemed like a classic and a dish I could never get in New York. It was delicious....except for the kidneys. Not Rules' fault, but I just discovered I don't like kidneys. A side of delicate, buttered savoy cabbage made up for it though. For dessert I went with the warm chocolate cake served with marmalade swirl ice cream and chocolate sauce. Even two and a half years later, I vividly remember being surrounded by three waiters, and how I didn't feel I deserved such attention. One placed the cake down, while another poured the thick chocolate sauce out of a silver gravy boat. Another stood guard, perhaps protecting me, who knows. I remember the bill being somewhere around 35 pounds, but definitely worth it for the experience. Whenever I can afford to return here, Rules will be one of the first stops on my list.",

I have to admit I am quite ignorant, besides not having watched a single episode of Downton Abbey, I have not heard of this place before! \u00a0So off we went on a Friday night for some very English and experience for the visitor. \u00a0We started off at the bar on the first floor, where we were offered some Japanese whisky, which was quite nice. \u00a0The interior does make you feel like you are teleported back in time, especially after I have downed a few glasses of scotch. Then we were ushered downstairs to our table, which was a cosy corner seat which came complete with a velvet couch. \u00a0We were recommended by another gentleman at the bar to try the grouse, which was in season but decided to go for the roast beef for two which came highly recommended by fellow yelpers. \u00a0We also ordered oysters to share, very fresh and tasty. \u00a0The roast beef was also executed to perfection. \u00a0My friend ordered the rabbit, but it tasted more like chicken and I thought that was ok. \u00a0Portions are quite sizeable leaving no room for desserts which is a pity. \u00a0Service was attentive but not intrusive. \u00a0A good place for people watching and even though it feels like a touristy kind of place, if your guest likes Downton Abbey and have some cash to spare, I would think this is a rather good option for them if they want a piece of the old London. \u00a0Prices can be on the high side given its location and fame and popularity with tourists, not the best value I have to say but I guess thats the least concern of the holiday makers especially if they choose to come to London.",

    "text": "As I indicated on trip advisor. I rarely review. Either when it's exceptional or terrible. \u00a0In my case, it was the latter. As background, my husband and I dined at Rule's 15 years ago on our first abroad trip together. We had a VERY EARLY reservation-6:00 pm. The place was almost empty & the maitre'd managed to seat us at the very worst possible table in the entire establishment-right next to the bus boy station where the plates and glasses were clanking and crashing so loud we could barely converse. It was such a distraction the entire time, I tried to finish my sentence before the next crash. As for good, it was \"meehh.\" For starters, we ordered garden salad and split pea soup. Both were fresh but bland. I used the salt shaker quite a bit. As main course, special of the day-lamb and guinea fowl. Both were a bit gamier than i'd expect. I love lamb so not new consuming it but you can also balance the flavor with yogurt/mint or other sauces which they didn't quite pull off. Finally, in spite of a comprehensive wine list, the 2 glasses I had were just not that good. In fact, the initial tasting of one glass had to be sent back b/c it was off. \u00a0After all that, I was eager to get out of there and skipped the dessert or their well known cheese cart altogether. We will be looking to a new place to create new memories at and recommend to our friends when visiting London.",

    "text": "There are people in life that you will always remember.People you meet for the first time and who you may not have the chance to see again but who will stay in your mind forever. People who will turn an easy-going evening into a once in a lifetime experience. People who, within a few hours, will teach you more than you have ever dared learn, just by listening to their passion and knowledge.While enjoying this priceless experience, you suddenly feel like a child being given a lesson in humility and modesty. And, secretly, you dream of feeling that same passion for life when the alarm clock rings in the morning. But first, Rules. Trying to move with the times while reflecting is weighty history, Rules , the oldest restaurant in London, is still rife with a charming English atmosphere reminiscent of a fine Parisian bistro; waiters dressed in bow ties and armed with a 'sans-faute' service. The grouse confirms its success day after day among customers who have come to enjoy its delicate taste for more than a hundred years. Since 1798, though, some creative touches have crept into the menu, including the tasty Dressed Dorset Crab. And, as the way to celebrate the national how-how of making pudding, the Sticky Toffee Pudding with Butterscotch Sauce will definitely reconcile you with traditional English cuisine. And now, let's step Upstairs at Rules. A year ago, when Rules reconverted their first floor into a bar, giving justice back to what it had been during the war, they couldn't have made a better choice than hiring one of the most recognised bartenders that long and short drinks have ever encountered. Mastering the art of cocktails may seem as easy as mixing the right measure of liquors in the right order and shake for the appropriate length of time just like cooking is all about mixing ingredients in the right order and cooking to taste. The perfect cocktail is about respect, about love and the passion you pour into every drink you make. And this is something that the Cocktail master Upstairs at Rules has understood to the very core. Thirty years after having served his father his first cocktail, Brian Silva, bartender extraordinaire at Rules, has become a master of understanding his customers' expectations, be it to create their preferred pre-dinner drink like they've never had it before or think up the relaxing potion which will put the finishing touch on an exquisite dinner at the restaurant downstairs. With a menu of only 10 specials but more than a thousand recipes in mind (and 200 written in his little black book), when Brian Silva looks at you and pops the question,'What are you in the mood for?' you know the experience is going to be worthwhile. Put the menu away, don't give a second's thought to what you thought you were going to drink; let yourself be lead by the master's flair and know-how. A last check if the drink should be rather short, long, sweet or bitter and the whole creation process starts. Among his alchemist's laboratory of first-choice liqueurs, Brian is a flurry of activity, only slowing as he pours each measure by eye over the perfectly 2-by-2-by-3 icecubes. For a moment, you're sure he would be just as quick \u00a0although no less impressive \u00a0if he was blindfolded. 'For me, the hit of the evening is to see the smile on my customer's face when they take their first sip'. So what does Master Silva think of the infamous classic, Rosebud's OBI Long Island Iced Tea? Equal measures of all the spirits and around 25ml or less of lemon juice. The spirits don't have to be a 25ml measure they can and probably should be less, say around 15ml of each. The cocktail should be tasted first and then balanced with coca-cola to offset the lemon. Lots of ice please!",

If you want old English charm, delightful surroundings and classic dishes, this is the place to come. But perhaps save it for a special occaision as we did \u00a0it's not cheap. The whole place retains an air of its own, as well as London's, history. All around amid the deep red, cushioned booths, there are satirical prints on the walls, and waiters cut a dash as they busy themselves in their crisp, fine livery. Service, as you would perhaps expect, is of the highest order. The menu is seasonal, and therefore changing subtly all the time. Food in a place like this is naturally cooked to order, and ingredients represent the best of British \u00a0beef, lamb, game, fish and shell fish \u00a0sourced from the finest corners of our Isles. I had a delicious and filling onion soup, akin to French soup, with a giant crouton, gloopy with juice on its underside. My partner had a perfectly prepared pigeon breast, pink and glistening. By the end of this starter I was fit to burst, but had to carry on until every last morsel was eaten from my main plate. I can't wait to return.",

The Windsor soup with Welsh rarebit and potted rabbit with apple chutney are wonderful starters. If you want a traditional British dish for your main course, the steak and kidney pie is perfect. I also recommend the curried pheasant and rack of lamb. If you have room for dessert, try the date and toffee pudding or spotted dick, whose name unfortunately makes me think of an STD!The decor is elegant and the service is impeccable.

However, despite this, it has become more of a tourist trap, luring them into trying something from their large menu at typical tourist prices. The food they serve is that of traditional, heavy British cuisines such as game (which is sourced by Rules itself), pies, oysters and wonderfully rich puddings. The menu is extensive and enticing, and the food, depending on what you chose, not too bad, but far too expensive for what it's worth. The decor is very over the top, old-school English, where every wall is covered with ornaments of some sort, paintings and mounted heads of animals. The eccentricity in its design is amusing and is worth a look, but all in all you can get what they serve in a decent gastro-pub without all the pent up hype and at less of a dear cost.",

Not even a candle on the dessert!Worth having a meal here though since all the dishes ordered were spot on. The crab on toast, fois gras, rib eye beef on the bone. All really good. Expensive.",

I tried the steak and kidney pie for the main and the potted shrimp for starter both fantastic. The rest of The group went for the roast beef and the beef cheeks both excellent choices.I am now sat planning a reason to go back to Rules either for business of pleasure. This is the oldest restaurant in London and full of character and characters. The staff make you feel like your at home and you feel their commitment to the restaurant and their customers. Sat looking in my diary to seen when we can go back.....10 out of 10 from me.",

    "text": "For my friends birthday, we came for a late lunch at Rules. They accommodated us very quickly and easily. The menu here is phenomenal. Seeing as we don't do big fancy lunches or dinners often, the five of us decided to just go for it. Why not right, we are at the oldest restaurant in London after all. We started off with one of their speciality drinks called The Grouse, which is Famous Grouse, Ginger Wine and Bitters. If you've never had one, think of a Whiskey Sour but WAY better. My friends tried both styles of oysters available, they preferred the Duchy Native Oysters over the Frenchman's Creek Rock Oysters. I didn't partake, mostly due to the whole being allergic to all seafood thing. They seemed to quite enjoy it. I had the crisp wild rabbit, which was okay, but would have preferred frog legs or quail. For the main course, two of my friends decided to split the Deer loin and what was called Jugged Hare. We asked the waiter what exactly Jugged Hare was as we had never heard of it. It consists of wild hare stewed and cooked in its own blood. IN.ITS.OWN.BLOOD!. In the spirit of the afternoon, it was ordered. None of my friends liked it at all, complaining of a sharp after taste. When I gave it a go, I immediately loved it. Later on, our waiter informed us that only about 1 in 5 people that order it like it. On this afternoon, I was the one.Overall, the service was fantastic, our waiter was very friendly, helpful and put up with us when we got a bit out of hand. My rib eye steak was massive and cooked to perfection. Everything that I tried off of others plates was spectacular and the overall experience here was great. I would definitely recommend coming here if you are looking for a real nice outing.",

    "text": "Rules is London's oldest established restaurant, dating back to 1798. It specialises in game, oysters, pies and pudding - quintessential English fare. Situated at 35 Maiden Lane it is well placed to serve pre-theatre meals although to really experience Rules I feel that one must dedicate a whole evening to sampling the delights it has to offer. The building itself is reason enough to visit this restaurant. The walls are a testament to the many famous people who have dined here. Much of the building is original with stained glass skylights and panelled walls. Due to the original nature of the building the restaurant, spread over three floors can often seem cramped and it is always very hot. One concession that the restaurant has made to modernisation is the acceptance that the staff need not run backwards and forwards to the kitchen. Each staff member now has an electronic pad which takes your order and communicates it to the kitchen instantly. So what do you eat? Perhaps you would try the cream of herb soup with roasted king scallop, celeriac and hazelnut oil (served hot or cold) or maybe the fois gras and duck terrine with walnut and raisin bread, sauterne and port jelly. Not very PC but. For main do consider whatever they have on special and expect to pay around \u00a320 for a dish. The deer and teal come highly recommended. Then dessert. You cannot eat at Rules and not have dessert. My old favourite, a sauterne cr\u00e8me brulee has disappeared off the menu but I would recommend them all! The cheese board is simply spectacular. The wine list is particularly impressive from \u00a313.95 a bottle to \u00a3395.00, something to suit most. If in doubt ask for a recommendation. I would thoroughly recommend this restaurant if you enjoy good food and a convivial atmosphere. For any veggies who are still with me this really is not the place for you. There are constant reminders of what you are eating and no mistaking a bird on a plate. Booking is almost essential here, especially at the start of the Game season (12 August) and at Christmas. If there are more than two of you do not count on getting a table.",

    "text": "I was extremely concerned when I went to Rules for the first time, as this place's reputation has the unfortunate potential of being a disappointing tourist trap. Descriptives like a \"London landmark\" and \"oldest restaurant\" could turn out to be dining gold, but it could also go south just as quickly. Well, my fears were unfounded. If you like the traditional and comfortable meat and potato menu along with proper yet friendly service, you will love Rules. You start (more likely than not) with a cocktail upstairs in the bar as you await for your table. Unfortunately, they don't serve food at the bar for us business travellers sometimes dining alone, but even at a table, the Rules experience is worth it, with or without a dining companion. As others have stated, the dress code is dinner proper, but i think you can get away with anything so long as you don't look like you've just stepped off a beach in Ibiza. Going for an all-meat theme, I started with the Fois Gras which was a pate block of superb flavor and silky smooth texture. The roast beef for two was cooked perfectly with excellent flavor from the ageing. But more than just the perfect beef were the accouterments that were served, from the crispy yet slightly chewy yorshire pudding to the freshly graded creamed horseradish to the uniquely savoury and unfamiliar (at least to stupid Americans like me) creamed leeks. When you're sick of the cornish pastry, fish and chips and Indian Curry and crave something familiar yet still undeniably English, give Rules a try. Be prepared for a healthy bill at the end, but given the service, the flavors and the traditional setting, it's well worth it.",

However as there were four of us and we where celebrating the other couples second wedding anniversary I thought I would keep stum (anyway if we hadn't finished that would be his problem not ours). We each had our starters two opting for the dressed Crab, and two choosing the Coronation Terrine which I must say was excellent. For our main course my partner choose Venison Loin, I choose the Duck breast which was cooked exactly as requested, and the other couple opted for Steak and Kidney pie and fish pie, both I was reliably informed was excellent. The Treacle sponge pudding I had for dessert finished the evening of perfectly. We did finish later than 8.00pm but fortunately we where not interrupted so didn't have to get my stroppy head on, and were all very satisfied with the evening. Looking at some of the other meals leaving the kitchen these also looked excellent especially the HUGE Yorkshire puddings. The restaurant is reputed to be the oldest in London dating back to 1798, the decor is certainly unique and adds to the occasion. Don't expect a cheap night here but do expect a pleasant one. The only criticism I would make has already been mentioned but didn't spoil our evening.",

I had dinner here before going to see the \"Producers\" and it is located conveniently from \"theatreland\" about a 5min walk from the Theatre Royal Drury Lane where the Producers was playing at the time. Anyways, on to the food. For a started I had the smoked salmon. Best smoked salmon I've had (in London). For my main, I had a steamed lobster with a side of mash...the lobster was succulent, well prepared, and tasted divine. The mash was also very good, just the right hint of butter. I finished with a Golden Treacle Sponge Pudding with custard. Their menu does change frequently and they have all the traditional English favorites (i.e. Brown Windsor Soup, Steak & Kidney Pie, etc.) They also feature fresh game and when it's in season, Grouse...if you're into Grouse. I like how they have a little disclaimer on the menu stating that the fresh game may contain \"shot\" lol.I recommend this place even though some would argue it's a tourist trap.They have a very respectable selection of Scotch too.",
