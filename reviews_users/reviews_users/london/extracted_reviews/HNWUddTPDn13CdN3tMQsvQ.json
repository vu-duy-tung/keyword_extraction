I can join their NEW scheme though... more money please. Sir.Due to this we postponed our visit until a quieter time and were seated within 20 minutes which was fine for such a busy restaurant. We were seated downstairs in a corner and the food was standard HRC fare, Legendary Burger was good, Spring Rolls are very good (try these!).I just don't think the place has the same appeal as it once did, they don't appear to care about their guitar collections as they once did (most of the ones downstairs were covered in fake cobwebs for halloween to the point of being unrecognisable).The waiters and waitresses used to be attentive and personable but now it seems it's more a case of 'processing' customers as soon as is possible.",

Not because we're huge fans, but because without fail by the time we're looking for dinner on Sunday nights, HRC's are inevitably the only thing open.I looked forward to this one since it is the original one, and must say, really enjoyed the experience! Our wait was very short, and they managed to find us a booth tucked away in the back near a tv so we could listen to and watch the videos. The wait staff was beyond excellent - our waitress was cute and funny and told us random stories, which were really entertaining.The food wasn't quite as good as the Venetian HRC, but it was pretty decent. Gigantic portions, at least. We asked our waitress to recommend a dessert, so we got a large piece of chocolate cake. The lady knew her desserts! It was amazing. Seriously, get that cake when you go there. So gooooood. One of the best parts was that they played a Cure video. Honestly, Robert Smith adds a star to any dining experience.",

I am not a regular at these types of places but every now again I visit with friends from out of town for a burger and a few beers before we set off on a shopping trip or a night out. You know what you are going to get and they always deliver it. The Park Lane Hard Rock also houses the vault where they showcase there most valuable rock memorabilia. Dedicated shop just over the road as well, where you can purchase the Hard Rock branded t-shirts, sweat shirts and merchandise and of course they can easily cater for large parties or product launches etc.",

The London location was interesting especially because of the 1500+ memorabilia. Don't forget, this is the land of rock, pop and contemporary music--so lots of British Invasion 60s stuff from Beatles to the Who. I didn't have time for the burgers, but I can get that anywhere. From what I can see from the door way, it had the same standard HRC format that you see from Fukouka to Honolulu HRCs. I'd say, I enjoyed the London HRC and the Copenhagen Hard Rock Cafe near Tivolli (across the Radisson SAS Hotel and train station)--if it's still there-- because they seem so Americana in places that seem not so USA.",

Onto the food. \u00a0I believe we all got some type of burger as we were looking right over the kitchen. \u00a0She made sure they were cooked perfectly and everything was piping hot. \u00a0I guess my experience was a much more positive one than others. \u00a0We make it a habit to check out the HRC's whenever we're visiting another country and I guess we were just fortunate to have such a good experience. \u00a0I would recommend this spot, but I would also say that if you've been to one--then you've been to them all. \u00a0It's just whether or not you want to wait and be surrounded by just a few lovely Americans :-)Have fun peeps",

We were told depending on time of day and day of week there would be lines of people waiting to get in. So good luck! As for the food and service... I am a picky person especially about my food. I ordered just a hamburger and fries. My burger did come out a lil pink in the middle, but I ate around it. For some people a lil pink in the middle is the way they like it so i didn't make a big deal about it. My friends had no complaints about there food. Service was good. Stop in and see for yourself, Hard Rock Cafe is the place to go!",

    "text": "No Drugs or Nuclear Weapons Allowed Inside.Hey Hey My My Rock And Roll Will Never Die.Before Steve Jobs was insanely great...Rock and Roll was insanely great. And The London Hard Rock Cafe was and is ground zero for many rock and roll fans. The London HRC started in the early 1970's with a donation of a Fender Guitar by Eric Clapton. This is not just a tourist trap restaurant. It is the original HRC and it contains many historical instruments and costumes from famous music legends. Across the street from the restaurant is the gift shop and basement vault that houses some of the more valuable artifacts from Jimi Hendricks, BB King and John Lennon. Tours of the vault, led by the vault master are free. 5 stars for History BuffsBut, the London HRC is also a great popular restaurant. Often packed, with a long wait or long line outside, you can go wait at the gift shop and vault. 4 stars for the wait.Food: Sizzling Fajitas are as good any out there. always a winner. My wife always gets this. For me I get grilled Veggie Sandwich. Always excellent. It gets a solid 4.25 stars on my meatless sandwich scale. Of course, my daughter gets the Burger and Fries. She loved it along with a real milk shake. I've also had the fish sandwich there. 5 Stars over all for the food. For London tourists this is a must see....don't miss destination. If you only had one day in London, this is where you want to have lunch! If you are not a tourist it is a good place for an American Style meal at a reasonable price.In the world of Rock and Roll this is almost as good as it gets. 4.5 Stars over all if you like music. Less if you don't really care.Getting there: Tube: Hyde Park Corner or Green Park. Or long walk from Buckingham Palace.",

At night you seem to pull it back, but why can't it be all the timeI love the walls, infact if I could bypass the queue and promise not to go near the bar or order food I'd love to just go wandering the walls.Out of all the UK, I think I'd rate Hard Rocks Best to worst, Edinburgh, London, Manchester...

Hence you wait in line outside for a while till they give you a vibration alarm device and tell you to come back in 45 minutes or to start drinking at the bar. Once you have your table you realize it is pretty busy and loud in there. It's not just the loud music, it's the mass of loud people as well which makes this place a very busy one.The staff is very friendly and helpful, quick as well and always offers support. the food is very good, the burgers are classic, sauces delicious and cocktails are very good as well. I would always come back for the food and the experience. I would not if I'm looking for atmosphere and just a a nice place to eat. And the waiting time is usually a real mood killer...",

This was spent in their shop and outside of the restaurant where we were able to sit at a table with heating. I ordered the salmon and my two friends both got the fajitas. When the salmon came it was a very small portion, and the beans, mashed potatoes and salmon were all low warm. They were not hot so I am assuming that it was not freshly prepared. I did really like that the salmon was cooked on a ceder wood piece which gave it a nice aroma. This dish was definitely not worth the \u00a317.50 that I had to spend. Overall this was a mixed experience for me and also my first time at a hard rock cafe, but I will not be visiting another hard rock cafe anytime soon!",

When walking to the place I got lost but quickly found it because of the great decorations and neon sign out front. The porch is covered so if you wanted to sit outside to eat or have drinks while you wait for a table inside there's a plant wall that shielded you from the nose of the street traffic and passer-bys. I was there during the Christmas and New Year week of 2012 so it was kind of cold and the restaurant had heaters outside to keep the customers warm while they drank. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. I went there twice on my visit and while there wasn't a wait the first time the second time I went there was a bit of a wait but not by much. The food was great. The first time I went to London I was really sick with the flu and didn't enjoy anything because I couldn't smell (I should have just cancelled but I was to pumped to go, so I went). So everything kind of taste like cough medicine. However I got redemption when dinning at the Hard Rock. On the two different nights I went I had the steak dinner with mashed potatoes and the second night the Swiss Burgers. The drinks were great and the atmosphere was wonderful. It was really nice to see all of the memorabilia from of the Rock Stars. All in all I had a great time and would recommend going for drinks with friends if you ever get to go.",

I absolutely love the atmosphere, the music, the people who work there and the food! My favourite used to be the Honey citrus grilled chicken salad but now I must say the legendary burger, the salmon and pretty much everything else is just as good. For dessert you have to go for the Apple cobbler or the brownie, they are just unbelievable! The servers are always really friendly and chatty and are big part of the experience! In the summer you can sit outside which is lovely. Best is if you go for lunch right when they open cuz in the evenings it's absolutely crazy! You have to wait up to 3 hours which is ridiculous! (When I am hungry I am hungry!!) Go there, try amazing food which is not good for you but sooo good for you, and ROCK ON!",

I have been there only twice yet I definitely feel as if I have established such a strong bond with the hard-working and amicable waiters/waitresses and chefs, it is evident that these individuals are so proficient and work immensely hard due to the fact that there are so many people to deal with, yet they still have time to converse with their customers and diners and are very well-spoken and socially active. If there was an option, I would give them more than five stars, easily the top three of the restaurants which I have attended and the food was definitely delectable and flavorsome. I will absolutely be re-attending soon and have introduced this fine establishment to many of my friends via WhatsApp and Twitter. Exquisite decoration and wonderful rock music, I have also conversed with the fellow clientele, many of which were from the United States, excellent to talk to, very cool individuals and it was pleasurable having such an excellent time.

My cousin accidentally knocked her drink over on the bar and he immediately made her another one, free of charge. The drinks were subpar, I ordered what the guy told me was their \"strongest\" cocktail and it was laughable, literally could not taste any alcohol in it whatsoever. \u00a0The food was good, but not spectacular, definitely nothing to write home about. \u00a0It's your typical American style food, with a slight British twist. \u00a0The prices were pretty high, I thought. 3 cocktails, 1 beer and 2 meals cost us around \u00a375. \u00a0Definitely not worth the price.

    "text": "When some friends came to visit a couple of weeks ago we went to the Hard Rock Cafe in Piccadilly for lunch on one of the days. I've been to a couple of Hard Rocks across the world but this was the first time I'd been to the London branch.The cafe is very popular with tourists so if you don't have a reservation be prepared to wait. We arrived at just after 1pm on a Saturday and there was a short queue but we couldn't have been waiting more than twenty minutes before we were seated.Let's be clear, Hard Rock Cafe isn't somewhere you go for peace and quiet or a romantic meal out, it's busy and noisy but has a fun atmosphere and plays great music. If you do have to wait you can just pitch up at the bar and since the soft drinks are bottomless you don't have to spend a fortune either unlike at some establishments.We were seated in the downstairs areas which is actually quite a bit bigger than upstairs but was still jam packed with people. The choices include pretty standard American style food; burgers, salads and sandwiches, an excellent dessert menu and an even better choice in cocktails!Having perused the menu the boys settled on some epic looking burgers while I went for the famous Hard Rock fajitas with grilled chicken and shrimp. (That's prawns to us Brits!) When the food arrived we weren't disappointed the portion sizes were pretty decent.I was given four small wraps with my fajitas which was enough for me as that was about the limit as to what I could eat but there was at least enough food left over to make two or three more and for once in my life I didn't complain about not having enough guacamole! Every bite was delicious but sadly that meant that there was no room for pudding - guess that just means I'll have to visit again.The service was pretty slow and it took us quite a while to actually place our order in the first place and indeed get the bill to pay at the end of our meal but given how busy the restaurant was this was I guess this is just to be expected.",

I was feeling a little crazy, and you didn't see that coming did you?!The Texan; pulled chicken, Chipotle and Hickory Bar-B-Que sauce, cheddar cheese, crispy jalapenos and crispy onions. Oh yes. \u00a0It was served with citrus coleslaw and cowboy beans.The partner in crime had similar, minus the crispy jalapenos and crispy onions, and we both enjoyed equally! I'm rather glad I made the decision to steer away from my normal choice! \u00a0I'd recommend both of this to anyone! \u00a0Plus being chicken I felt slightly less guilty that having a burger!To top it all off we were sat in the Sex Pistols/Public Image Ltd. area so I was well in my element. \u00a0It's like they knew I love them! \u00a0I want the red bondage boot so bad!We didn't have space for desert, so we paid up and headed off to Winter Wonderland. \u00a0The rain had stopped if you were wondering!",

This time we went at 5pm on a Saturday (with a reservation - always go with a reservation!) They told us it'd be a 15 minute wait but then someone else called us right in and took us to our table. I'd won a competition and our meal was on the house, this time from the special chilli menu. We were treated really well, and looked after attentively. The food was a bit slow to come but considering they were completely full and had a queue out the door, that's to be expected.Our burgers were really nice - we both ordered them without chilli (as it has beans) but the burger was well cooked, and not too dense. It had a cheese sauce and jalapeno salsa, both of which should be served on everything they sell. It needed some bacon and in hindsight, I should have asked for some.Then we had the chilli chocolate brownie with ice cream. I thought it was pretty good and enjoyed it but there wasn't any chilli taste as far as I could tell.The 5th star is lost due to the delay with the food, and the fact that it's really, really expensive - the chilli burger and plain chips was \u00a317.25, which is pretty crazy. But if you're there for the experience, it might be worth it to you!",

Yes I liked all the cool decor and the different food choices, but some of the prices didn't seem to make much sense. I forget what I got, but all I know is that it wasn't all that impressed with it. Probably why I don't remember what I got. I feel like I also had like two different waiters at some point. Though the staff were really nice and attentive for the most part, i don't know if I'll go back. To me, it's like a one and done type of place.",

There are Hard Rock Cafes all over the world after all, one in every city more or less, especially in the kitch landscapes of Florida and Vegas. But people, London is the ORIGINAL, opened in 1971 with help from Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend among others. It is a rock mecca and an authentic American cuisine trendsetter.Starting the trend for proper American food, which is still raging today with places like Meat Liquor popping up all over London, the eats are classic, delicious, saucy dreams come true. My dad was here when it opened, and I still visit with him today. You really can't beat their buffalo wings, smoked ribs, Texan pulled pork sandwiches or legendary burgers. The bar is also home to some of the greatest cocktails around, including the brilliant Electric Blues (nothing tastes better than a bright blue cocktail)Come for the history, come for the music, and come for the wings! This place is the original and best.",

    "text": "This is the original Hard Rock Cafe, a brand which can now be seen all around the world - in fact it's a rare trip abroad where there isn't a Hard Rock nearby. We meant to go to the one when we were in Bucharest recently but just didn't get around to it. Getting to the London one can be a little tricky - the road outside isn't pedestrian friendly with a massively complicated series of underpasses through the roundabout (it's more than a roundabout, but you know what I mean).I've been here numerous times now, and the service is very friendly - always on that American level. You almost forget sometimes that you're actually in London still at times since the service is so good. The menu used to be quite expansive, but they've reduced it down now - a wise move I think as it only appears to be the things that can be cooked in a decent time. The menu is pricey, and I wouldn't suggest that you bother with the starters since they're quite small for the price.So why am I giving out four stars? Frankly because the place is so iconic. I've had good meals here and some particularly dreadful one - but in recent trips it's been getting a lot better. We tried out the chilli menu and the burger was really good - pricey but good. If you're into your music then you have to come here even if it's just to have a drink at the bar and admire the memorabilia. The Rock Shop is nearby (that's rock music, not \"they're minerals, Marie\") which in itself is pretty cool. Overall; The original? Yes. The best? No. But it shows signs of improvement in recent visits.",

    "text": "I broke one of my cardinal travel rules my first night in London - never eat somewhere that you can eat at at home. \u00a0It's mostly good for avoiding fast food like McDonald's. \u00a0But I was caught in a wave of nostalgia, remembering my first trip to London in 1977 during college, eating at the very first Hard Rock ever, co-founded by Issac Tigrett, a graduate of my alma mater. \u00a0There was a Centre College pennant on the wall which made us proud (this was before they started collecting rock-'n-roll memorabilia a couple of years later). \u00a0But this felt different and for good reason. \u00a0They'd moved from the original location in a former Rolls Royce dealership into a smaller space. \u00a0I was a surprised at how small it felt and of course the Centre pennant is long gone. \u00a0There's always a line at any Hard Rock I've visited and the tried and true way to get seated quickly is to eat at the bar, so that's what I did. \u00a0The menu in London is similar to, if not exactly the same, as menus in most of the Hard Rocks I've eaten at. \u00a0I went with the no fail Big Cheeseburger, swapping my fries for onion rings (wonderful), washing it all down with a couple of Boddington brews. \u00a0It was pretty good including Dan, my server. \u00a0Desserts looked downright sinful and I managed to resist this time around. \u00a0Look at your receipt carefully because it shows that an optional service charge has been added for the London Hard Rock staff. \u00a0I guess that's code for you can always leave more. \u00a0Afterwards I stopped in the Rock Store and bought a couple of Hard Rock London pins. \u00a0My favorite was an iconic red phone booth with a door that opened.If you like the Hard Rock experience and don't mind an American-centric menu by all means stop by. \u00a0It's a piece of Hard Rock history.",

    "text": "I'm not totally sure why I decided that I needed to come here while in London. \u00a0I mean honestly, if you've seen one Hard Rock, you've basically seen them all. \u00a0But for some weird reason I was drawn to this place.I came in to grab some lunch and was promptly seated at the bar area, or I guess whatever that area was called, it really wasn't a bar and it kind of overlooked the kitchen/serving area. \u00a0The hostess that had seated me was informative of the place and had asked me where I was from. \u00a0When I said Pittsburgh she automatically said Pennsylvania, then she second guessed herself, but then again came back to PA, it was a nice conversation and a welcoming gesture. \u00a0Sitting at this bar area you got to see the food be prepared and watch the staff interact with one another. \u00a0They were enthusiastic and entertaining for sure.After browsing the menu I finally decided on what I wanted. \u00a0My server was right on top of things, like anytime I needed things he was magically there. \u00a0I had placed my drink order, still water, and when he came back I placed my order. \u00a0I decided on the Guinness bacon cheeseburger with a side of Guinness beer cheese fries. \u00a0When this thing appeared it was massive. \u00a0I now understand why so many places serve their burgers with steak knives. \u00a0What drew me to this burger was the fact that it was combining Guinness and Jameson on a burger. \u00a0The cheese contained the Guinness but what I was more interested in trying was the Jameson bacon jam. \u00a0You would think this thing would be salty, but for some reason it did not have that overwhelming salt flavoring. \u00a0In fact the flavors melded so well that I devoured that thing quickly, along with the Guinness cheese covered fries.After I finished and paid I decided to make my way to the store area, which is actually across the small street. \u00a0Of course you want to buy a shirt or what not to let people know you went to a Hard Rock Cafe. \u00a0I browsed and picked out a couple of shirts and paid. \u00a0If you want, you can stick around a bit in the store area and go to the Vault. \u00a0I didn't, but I hear it's a small museum.",

When the waiter realized I wasn't drinking it I expected him to offer to make a new pot, no, he offered to warm it up in the microwave for me. \u00a0I said no thank you and he took it off the bill. The food itself was average. \u00a0I've had better chicken fajitas at other Hard Rock Cafes for much cheaper. \u00a0The most annoying part had to be the wait. \u00a0We were done for a solid 15 minutes before they took anything away and then when it came time to pay he could not get the credit card machine to work which took us an additional 20 minutes. \u00a0The food itself was okay and the service was poor. \u00a0The food is also very expensive for two people with no drinks it ended up costing almost $100.00, no thank you.Skip this on your trip, if you want a good Hard Rock go to the one in Orlando. \u00a0It's the biggest in the world, has better food, and better prices.",

The bread was very hard. Obviously stale or had been sitting out for hours. Sent it back and the second set of bread was about half as stale, but still clearly not fresh. They must toast it to hide the stale bread. They also served stale bread with the macaroni and cheese which was flavourless. Not impressed. And the music was turned up much louder partway through the meal to the point we had to practically yell to hear each other. Service was mediocre. One server argued that the bread was not toasted the first time. I could knock it on the table...",

We were seated quickly even though there was a small queue outside and our food came out really quickly as well. We were seated downstairs so you have a bit more room than upstairs in the main restaurant, where it can be a bit of a squeeze, although the music downstairs was a bit loud and overpowering. Our server kept encouraging us to have cocktails or add additions to our dishes, he was really nice and really wanted to look after us. My sister and I both went for the Fiesta Burger due to the guacamole! It was delicious. My sister did ask for bacon on hers after the server 'up sold' on the toppings and then they forgot to add it! We shared a side dish of Mac & Cheese which was also delicious. We were both stuffed by the time we had finished, so couldn't fit in dessert. It was a solid burger, really enjoyed it. The London Hard Rock is definitely one of their better cafes and I've never had a bad experience here. What made this visit even sweeter was the discount I had from having their reward card! \u00a312.00 off my bill. Bonus!",

There wasn't a clear waiting area while you were waiting to be seated. And the outdoor seating available was minimal. Prices were high as expected and the food was subpar. The drinks were so light we had to ask our server if it was an alcoholic beverage. They did add liquor to it which was nice. Definitely somewhere you go for the experience rather than the food.",

    "text": "As always Hard Rock cafe doesn't disappoint! Great as always this place has a unique vibe of rock n roll combined with great food.I generally take the Legendary burger and it's simply put one of my favorite dishes ever. The onion rings are better than anywhere else and the fries are beautifully crisp, perfectly salted. The Burger itself is big, really big, so I definitely keep that in mind before you order it. I also highly recommend the fajitas (personally I go for the combo but I'm sure the others are good too), the NY strip steak, and the Jumbo Combo as a starter. The atmosphere as I said is really nice. The music is great and there's always something to look at! I would actually recommend this for a birthday celebration or any kind of celebration.As for price, you need to keep in mind that this is a touristic attraction. Most of the customers are tourists so obviously the prices won't be the same as at Spoons. Then again the quality of your food is also very good so keep that in mind as well. The cokes are also refillable which is great! All in all, I'd say that prices could be better but considering the fact that it's in central London, it's really not too bad at all.As for the service, it's mostly great. However there have been a few misses from past experiences. I think this is mainly due to the fact there are too many customers and the amount of orders can be a bit overwhelming. A possible to fix would be to hire more waiters to make the experience more enjoyable for everyone. Yet, judging from my last experience, service was great and the waitress (of which I forgot the name) was super nice and helped us get our food as quickly as possible as my friend had to catch a flight shortly after.Considering that this is the first Hard Rock Cafe in the world, it definitely lives up to its name.",

If you have time, go and see their little museum, their wonderful tour guide is a lot of fun, and you get to see some brilliant music memorabilia. I was Bob Dylan's hat. In my lunch break.

The staff are really good and we were served by one of the original waiting staff who worked there when the cafe first opened! The food is great & you get generous portions (try the nachos, it's listed as a starter, but you could easily get 3 courses out of them!) the music is awesome, but you have to be a fan of rock, otherwise you may get a bit bored. Occassionally there are live acts in the bar area, check the website for listings. The Hard Rock Cafe shop is across a small road opposite the restaurant",

The restaurant is known for loud restaurants because of the loud music and the many tourists, which shows the chain must be doing something right. This particular location earns an extra star because it has a museum full of music history memorbilia. If you are lucky enough to get invited into the museum, you can touch pretty much anything as long as you ask nicely. I got to hold Jon Bon Jovi's guitar, and my friends held Jimi Hendrix's guitar and Miles Davis's trumpet. One of John Lennon's jackets is also on display. The food is typical Hard Rock Cafe menu items including burgers, salads, pasta, dessert and specialty mixed drinks. The service is just OK, nothing to write home about, and definitely expect to wait for a table even if you go in the middle of the day, especially during high tourism seasons.",

    "text": "I'm not sure why the Hard Rock Cafe is linked with the Apollo Theatre in Victoria because, unless you take the bus or tube, it is a decent 15+ minute walk from the theatre and therefore unless you get to Hard Rock quite early for a meal (say 5.30) chances are you will be rushing your meal and to your show that no doubt starts at 7.30. But anyway, I wanted to see Billy Elliot and this currently seems to be the best offer around. For \u00a360 we got excellent seats in the Dress Circle and a 2 course meal plus softdrink (from a limited set menu) at Hard Rock. We arrived at Hard Rock Cafe at around 5.45 and it was absolutely heaving. There was one guy handling the seating arrangements and my first, of two gripes, with the Hard Rock Cafe was that this guy was not great at handling pressure and totally unhelpful. The conditions of our deal was that we had to make a reservation, which we did. Obviously there were a lot of walk-ins to Hard Rock Cafe and not enough tables so fair enough the walk-in lot got sent to the bar to wait for a table (the wait at the time was given as between 45 mins to an hour!) When I informed this guy that we'd made a reservation his reply was to add us to the waiting list, to give us a buzzer and to assure us that we would get the first free table. My issue with this was that he didn't even bother checking our reservation which, if he'd done his job properly, he should have seen that one of the few empty tables was allocated to us and seated us straight away. Normally I wouldn't have minded but as we had to be out of there by 7.15 at the latest to make our show we were a bit concerned we would be late. Further, its not like this is a new offer so staff should have been aware of the time constraints for diners on this deal. When I asked for a menu so we could at least choose our meal and have it ready for when we were seated he couldn't even do that and just ushered us to the bar. He quickly scooted away so I tracked down another more helpful member of staff. This is my second gripe - the person who had taken our reservation had failed to make note we were on the Billy Elliot offer so the staff didn't know which menu to give us. Although the girl was very helpful and in fact arranged that we be seated straight away she had no clue which menu to give us and as a result there was confusion as to what we could order. Finally after about 15 mins we received the right menu and placed our orders. From that point on the service was perfect though I did have difficulty understanding our Eastern European waitress. However, she was excellent, extremely efficient and super-friendly even allowing us to upgrade one of our desserts for nothing! She also gave us tickets to enter the museum (which unfortunately we didn't really have time for.) Food was delivered quite promptly and it was very delicious. I would like to give Hard Rock Cafe another go because the food (selection includes burgers, grills, barbecue, salads etc) we received was quite good and the meals that other diners around us received looked equally appetising. The restaurant itself also had a nice vibe (if a bit loud) and most staff, barring the first hopeless guy we encountered, were generally fantastic. But I really was a bit turned off by my two gripes.",

Whist others in the party have had a great time I've never really got it. True the portions are ample - North American standard really - but the quality of the food and service is nothing great. So far, nothing too bad but then came my last visit a week ago and I really didn't expect the two veggies in the party to end up with stomach upsets! They described the veggie burger as undercooked and indigestible and they suffered for not sending it back to be cooked properly. The meat eaters amongst us found the food cooked well but the service a bit erratic. The rock music was OK, the memorabilia impressive I suppose but it would be depressing if 'rock' was the greatest contribution of the 20th century to human culture. I suppose the cafe seemed just a little fake to me, almost a parody of itself - but perhaps I'm being a little harsh. It would have been 3 stars without the dodgy veggie food - will I go again? No, not worth it and certainly not worth queueing for!",

Not sure they're wearing the same uniforms now since the brand has changed.HRC has been so commercialized now that the used to be fun rock image brand has been changed so much. Now there is a Hard Rock Cafe Museum, Hotel, etc. My favorite food was club sandwich in addtion to best burgers in London/ fries and I still remember the taste of the food. Best apple pies and banana split was just amazing.This place was a \"ROCK\" a symbol of US image and \u00a0an icon in London and hope the spirit of rock 'n' roll always present. I wouldn't hesitate to visit again. A Massive \"H3LLO\" As good as it gets for this original Hard Rock Cafe. \"Cheers\"",

If you have time, try to get across the road to the Hard Rock Vault (in the basement of the Hard Rock Store), the tours take about 10mins and if you are a Rock N Roll fan its well worth seeing some of the bits they've got stashed away in there.",

    "text": "This is the first Hard Rock cafe I have ever visited. Five years ago. I had an apple pie. It was quite tasty, but too sweet. I liked the glasses they served cranberry juice in. After eating, we got something like a pass and we could go to the basement where they had a lot of guitars. There was a man working there and cleaning the guitars. Before we entered the room, the waitress told us not to touch anything, but later that guitar supervisor let me hold Kurt Cobain's guitar and even put his glasses on :oSo, I had a wonderful experience!",

They knew everything on the menu and all was served in good time. Cost of the meal wasn't cheap but for the size of the portions well worth it.Would highly recommend if in London and great for a group of you",

I've never been to a Hard Rock before (and they certainly seem to have loyal devotees who visit a branch in every city they visit) and to be honest I don't think I'd go back off my own back. Definitely worth a visit once to check it out but over priced at the end of the day. I think if I'd paid myself I'd probably knock off another star",

Overall a tourist joint and nice stop for a big group during dinner on the way down to the Piccadilly Circus area.",

Staff are also very friendly.If you're looking for a sophisticated restaurant then stay away, but Hard Rock is great if you just want to have fun.",
