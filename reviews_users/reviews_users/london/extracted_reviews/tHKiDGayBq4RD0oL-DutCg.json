At least four slices of thick bacon in there. Proper sorted me out!Cooked breakfast sitting in was also excellent, and good value for money.A nice clean sleek interior with funky decorations and books will make you feel right at home.Note: breakfast served only until 10.30 during the week (12.30 at weekend).Recommended.",

For a small coffee house, they have quite the sandwich/lunch selection, and after a few minutes, I went with a latte and a pesto, avocado sandwich. The latte was delicious, and the sandwich was easily the best of its kind that I have ever had, which is quite the compliment from a strict carnivore!I would definitely return if I was in the area.",

I would say a little bit pricey for the portion size but certainly tasty. The porridge had the apposite texture (indicative of proper overnight oat-soaking), the potato cakes which accompanied the scrambled eggs were more akin to pancakes in texture and appearance but still enjoyable.Not much seating space inside as the place is tiny, but if you do grab a spot it certainly feels cosy being sunken from street level.

Key: \u00a0come after 11:30 to eat all the amazing salads and veggie items. \u00a0The breakfast is just ho-hum. But the salads, the quiches, the baked goods that the pastry chef used to make, these were delicious. I hope she comes back!!!! \u00a0The coffee, with whole organic milk, also is worth coming back for. \u00a0While I was writing this review, a wonderful staff member saw that I did not like my breakfast and came and REPLACED it with the very salads that I was longing to try. \u00a0So I think the staff alone have led me to give a full five star review. While I'm writing this a little message that says that my review is making the \"yelposphere\" a better place. I do respect yelp's commitment to an objective viewpoint and that is why I usually turn to yelp when I'm looking for a place to eat or drink in a strange city.",

    "text": "One of the many nice cafes tucked away in Bloomsbury. I love stopping here for a quick snack after class. They have a selection of salads fresh everyday and pastries. My favorite are the blondies - chewy, crumbly, and not too sweet if paired with a black coffee. The first time I stumbled upon this cafe, it was admitted the color mosaic stair fronts along many doorways on Tavistock Street that caught my eye. Bloomsbury Coffee House is actually downstairs, below street level. There is probably two tables in the outdoor downstairs. There is more seating indoors that spans two rooms. Overall, how would I describe the ambiance? Sweet and cozy. Perfect for discussing schoolwork over a cuppa.",

Perfect for someone who's looking for small nibbles and drinks. They do have a variety of fresh sandwiches available from 11am - 3pm, ranging from smoked salmon, grilled Haloumi, chicken and honey roasted ham. There are vegetarian options such as tarts, quiches and salads. Decent prices!! Could get a meal with drinks below \u00a310 here, rare in London. Outdoor seating is limited, fits 3 couples max (tables of 2). The inside is a wider, and could fit more but it's definitely not a place for big groups or anything more than 3. Seems more like a takeaway kind of place... If you manage to get a seat outside that would be perfect! Especially when the weather is nice and sunny. You do get a bit of noise from the cars driving pass and from pedestrians. If you'd like to get some work done it would be best to be seated inside, though I found it a little hot and humid.",

It came on some kind of dark multigrain bread, and was delicious. I also had a latte, which was great as well. Their cinnamon roll is also to die for. Its a great spot to sit and read or get some work done, but does tend to be busy. The staff is very friendly and great at what they do. Overall, a really nice little place for a sip and a bite.",

Discreet entrance due to fact you have to go down a little stairs. Front room is airy and light though I moved to back where it was much more packed sitting. A lot of students possibly because of nearby uni students. Lot of people eating too so might be quite cheap but didn't check. Seems to be an in the know popular place as it kept getting more crowded and this was random time during the day. Overall it's a cute little place to spend time in with good quick wi Fi with a good coffee. Nice atmosphere inside too.",

    "text": "I'm really sorry, I'm really sorry, I think I just have the February grumps?I'm just feelin' 3 stars here. And I gave it two go-s!I like the Bloomsbury Coffee House, but people had _really_ hyped up its appeal. I went mid-afternoon on a weekday to do some work, and it was pretty busy given the fact that it was surprisingly (mainly) hidden from street view (it's down a flight of stairs and below street level). A lot of students, which makes sense given the location. It has a great buzz, though I guess \"great\" depends on what kind of work you're hoping to tackle (FINAL STAGES OF THESIS YOU SAY? CUE CATHY COMIC-STYLE: GACK GACK GACK!!!).I like the look of a lot of things on offer: bircher muesli. Quinoa salad. Plenty of veggie-friendly options in the form of quiches. But I've never stuck around. I've been in twice; both for takeaway. Once for a chai latte and a brownie; the other time for a slice that was chock-a-block full (unexpectedly) of marshmallows. It's cute, it's warm, I (in my limited time in the space given the takeaway) had friendly service...it just...was kinda meh. Both baked goods were fine, but overly sweet for my taste and nothing truly righteous. And I appreciate the range of hot drinks on their menus (a great place to bring someone who isn't a coffee lover; teas and tea lattes and hot chocolates), but the chai latte wasn't my fave. I think part of my feelings for Bloomsbury Coffee House is unfortunately coloured by my love of other coffee-and-cake options right around the Judd Street / Tavistock Place intersection. So if it were stand-alone? Maybe you'd get 3.5 stars. I just feel like there are tastier, more affordable on-point-ier options just around the corner (I feel like it's bad manners to point 'em out, but if you read my reviews they ain't tough to identify).Yelp note: I'm totally willing to give their more extensive food menu a go. They make everything on premises and apparently there are cinnamon buns every AM at 8. I JUST FOUND MY SATURDAY MORNING EARLY RISE INCENTIVE.",

The wi-fi is fast, and the employees do not seem to mind you sitting for a while to get some work done. Around lunchtime, there is a wide variety of quiches and sandwiches available as well, and there are several vegetable mixes that looked extremely appetizing though I did not have a chance to try them.It's really close to UCL and SOAS, making it super convenient for college students.
