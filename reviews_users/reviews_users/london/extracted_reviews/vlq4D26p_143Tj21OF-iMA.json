I have been here many times for breakfast and dinner and I can tell that the experiences are different.Breakfast:It wasn't crowded so the staff was quick and friendly. The atmosphere in the morning is nice. We ordered the famous bacon naan roll and sausage naan roll and they are really good! Everytime when I am in London I have to eat breakfast here. Dinner:The evenings are always crowded and however the staff is still friendly, it takes more time to order. Or to get the right plates. Instead of the starters they gave us the main dishes first...the food was OK, not the best. This is good for people who are crying when they eat spicy food. Although I am crying sometimes I prefer spices. Overall I am a fan of Dishoom, because the trendy atmosphere, the breakfast and the affordable prices.",

    "text": "Best Indian food outside India. What else do i say.I was in London for a week and ate breakfast 4 times and dinner 4 times. Dishoom is inspired by Irani cafes in Bombay. Walk in and you will feel like you are in India. The wait is pretty long. If you go after 7 expect to wait in line for about 30 minutes and then maybe another 30 at the bar area. I would recommend going early. Breakfast: - Bottomless chai , must have. This is just like I would make it at home. Soothing and a great start to the morning. - Akuri : Delicious indian scrambled eggs with indian bread- Bombay omelette : Fluffy and has a great- Chilli cheese toast with eggs : ZOMG this is the best and takes me back to my life in bombay. Cooked to perfection Dinner- Ruby chicken : this is butter chicken , almost as good as eating in india '- Naan : Perfect naan actually cooked in a tandoor, thin flaky , heavenly- Chicken biriyani : Parsi style biriyani from Bombay. Made to perfection with marinated chicken spiced with pepper perfectly. Drinks - thumbs up flip : Thumbs up is Indian coca-cola. This drink is served with egg whites and whiskey - Chai : anytime of the day Desert: - Kulfi : average- Memsahibs mess : this is strawberries , merengue and cream muddled to perfection.",

    "text": "I came to Dishoom with a group of 11 people and can honestly say that I would love to go back pretty soon. Firstly, as our group was for 10 I telephoned three weeks in advance to make a booking. The only time slot they could give us was 5:45 which wasn't ideal but, given the popularity of this restaurant, I took. The staff were all very pleasant and helpful on the phone, and when I called a week or two before our reservation to ask if they can add one extra person onto the booking, I was nicely amazed that this wasn't a problem at all and done straight away by a chirpy sounding lady on the other end of the phone. When we arrived we were quickly seated, skipping the big queue outside. Kind of felt like VIP, actually. Perhaps the waiters came over a little too quickly to take orders as we felt a bit rushed to decide and order. The food came out in a good amount of time and I found mine delicious! None of that stodgy Indian food you usually get in other places, this food was light. The portion sizes are smaller than you would expect but it was enough to make me nicely full without giving me tut opportunity to overeat. Unfortunately not everyone else in our group felt the same and some ended up ordering a second thing to fill the gap. One person did comment that apparently they could taste that the meat was cooked separately to the sauce and added after, which I personally thought was nit-picking but oh well. The food is quite pricey for the portion sizes you get which I feel lets this place down. In terms of value for money, I guess it's lacking but it's pretty obvious that this is a place you wouldn't come to if you're on a tight budget.",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings regarding Dishoom. On the one hand, the food is really good and I like the somewhat non-traditional approach to the Indian cuisine. In addition, I really like the decoration and the atmosphere which really remind me of a colonial comptoir. The terrace is also nice, but some of the tables are not convenient when you are trying to eat something.However, I am really appalled by the lackadaisical service. First of all, one either has to come at an ungodly hour (i.e. 4-5 pm) or take the risk of having to wait in a queue for 1h30. Seriously, either they could raise the prices or allow people to book in advance. The personal, while polite, stand out by their lack of enthusiasm (and I have been there 3 times). I would still recommend the go if only once to try their Chicken Berry Britannia and the Lamb Botti Kabbab paired with a Lassi, they are all really good.",

    "text": "Last Sunday a friend and I went to Columbia road flower market. We were up and out early doors to make the most of the sunshine and were planning to get breakfast there as I've seen some reviews saying there are some great cafes. I didn't spot anything I fancied (did have a great freshly squeezed juice!) and knew dishoom was nearby so we wandered back that way hoping there would be a table.I've been to dishoom before - twice in Leicester Square and once in Shoreditch and allll for dinner - boy can I recommend the paneer curry, their rotis and naans and to finish of a kulfi! But I really love the Shoreditch branch and have been dying to come for breakfastIt was actually quite empty on a Sunday at 11 but I guess as they don't take bookings that could be why? Also the place is massive with lots of seating upstairs and down. My fav part though is they have a conservatory type area with sofas where they open the roof when it's sunny. This area was pretty busy but i was desperate to sit out there so we waited ten minutes for another couple to leave!Right now for the food - wow! I can't wait to go back already. I was lucky my friend agreed to get a few things and share everything. So I started off insisting we got the famous naan roll (I've seen it in so many mags and websites featured as one of the best brunch/ breakfast items), my friend chose the granola and then we decided to get the maksa bun to go with the chai we had ordered. What we didn't realise is that the maksa came with a chai. This came first so we were happily dipping the toasted buttery bread in chai while waiting for the rest. Would recommend but won't \u00a0be getting again - just a one time thing for me!Wow was the naan good! Cream cheese, crispy bacon and chilli jam in one of their delish naans served warm obvs. I'll def be getting this again and I also saw someone else with a sausage and egg naan which looked really good! We finished on the home made granola which was full of tasty nuts with their vanilla yoghurt and fresh fruit. Lovely way to finish and utterly stuffed!This is a definite recommend for both dinner and breakfast and I can't wait to come again! I want my bf to have the big bombay so I can try it all and also fancy the look of the Akuri (scrambled eggs) with a side of masala beans!",

But, at the end of the year, I finally got around to visiting.We managed to get a table within about ten of arriving at around 2.30 on a Sunday afternonn - a far cry from the mega-queues I'd expected. Which was a good thing. I went for the Chef's Special of the Lamb Raan Bun. Slow cooked pulled lamb with dishoom slaw and crisp-chips (basically, supersuper thin little chips which were definitely more crisps than chips - but really tasty and well seasoned). The lamb itself was an absolute joy - falling apart in my mouth, and great with one of the spicy chutneys that they brought out too.Unfortunately, despite the food being excellent, I felt pretty disappointed with the service. We were seated in the small, covered side area and were often left waiting for long periods when we were ready to order/for the bill/needed something. Our food came out at completely seperate times, and I was given the wrong ice cream at the end.If Dishoom's service matched up to its food quality then it's be close to a five star score from me, but unfortunately I felt slightly 'shafted' with our seating which dampened the experience slightly.",

I've particularly loved the black daal, the bowl of greens, the naan, and the matar paneer (paneer curry, basically), with the matar paneer being one of my favourite dishes in all of London. The cocktails are always interesting, and the beer selection is pretty good. The atmosphere is great, and the staff are always lovely and friendly.It's the starters that let the restaurant down a bit. I didn't really like the calamari or the samosas, among others. I thought it was great that the desserts are more interesting, but it can veer to the too strange spectrum.All that said, I always recommend Dishoom to visitors and residents of London alike.

Sure the no reservations thing can be a pain, but take that in stride and go on less busy times (when you'll only have to wait 30 min instead of 2 hours). Go to the bar, have a drink or 3, and ogle the awesome decor. It's seriously gorgeous. And the food. I cannot get over it. The daal is maybe even better warmed up the next day. I don't care that it's vegetarian. It's made from dreams. Also the greens with chilli and lime. And the naan. And all of it.",

    "text": "On a recent trip to England, we asked a local friend for a recommendation for a good, local Indian restaurant. They recommended Dishoom. My fiancee and I are huge fans of Indian food, so we took her recommendation.First, let's get the \"bad\" out of the way: Dishoom is so popular, and so good, that the wait on a Sunday evening is over an HOUR. Seriously, there's a line out the door and into the street. This is just a symptom of their success. Frankly, they just need to open another location or two. Incidentally, our friend warned us to go early, like 5 pm, if we didn't want to wait too long. We figured that a Sunday night wouldn't be too bad, so we got there around 6. The line was spilling out into the street.Now on to the \"Good\" (and there is a lot of good... )We met with the hostess outside, and she got us on the list, and into the line. While on line, a waiter comes through and brings out shots of various things. Sherry on one trip, maybe a chai shooter on the next. It was a nice way to wait in line, and socialize with our fellow diners.Once you make it to the door, they send you to the bar to wait some more. I think this is part of their business model. The bar is packed tight, with no place to sit, and almost nowhere to stand. Be pushy, or you'll never make it to the bar, and never get a drink. The bartenders are fantastic, and make some beautiful, artful drinks. We had 2 rounds, and that was great.We finally got a table, in the outside room, which was blissfully quiet. The waitstaff was fairly good. Friendly, mostly on top of it. The downside is that, again, being very busy, you can't get a lot of service. We waited ages for refills on water, mostly because they just don't have anyone filling water.Now, on to the excellent: The food. Fiancee spent months living in India, and she said this was as close as she's had since. We tried an excellent spread of different items, and they were all excellent. I think the Ruby Chicken was my favorite. Everything was spiced well, without being extreme.The cost was not particularly out of line. We spent a lot, but that was due greatly to the multiple rounds of drinks. I think each dish was priced well.I want to give Dishoom 5 stars, but for me, the crazy wait on a Sunday evening, both outside and in the bar, knocked off a star. I can't even imagine what a Friday or Saturday night looks like! Another slight knock: We asked the host to call us a cab, and they called us a car that I think was not an official cab. That was a little dicey, but it worked out OK. The driver was nice, anyway.Given the experience as a whole, I give Dishoom a solid 4 stars. I can see how they have so many 5 star reviews, but it wasn't quite there for us. Really good, but too many people for my taste.",

The setting is fantastic - there's this amazing convertible outdoor area, with either table seats or low seating with somewhat overly soft chairs. \u00a0I love the photos hanging and the distressed wood. \u00a0The roof looks like it peels back for the rare sunny day - which it was on my visit. The menu has loads of choices, and though the server recommended 3 dishes per person, I think that's actually much. \u00a0Loads of veg options, and plenty of delicious meaty ones too, including their signature lamb dish - which comes in either a whole leg (or was it rack?) for sharing or the bun for one (which really is a lot of food and could serve as a real entree for one). Even though we over-ordered, the bill came out to just slightly over 20 pounds per person - which is not bad for our delicious bounty (by London standards - I am not from here and finding all food quite pricey here). \u00a0Service is also lovely. \u00a0When my friend spilled his juice, he actually got a complimentary refill (and napkins and a rag right away). And remember - this is not meant to be an Indian restaurant! The staff are quick to correct you on that if they notice you making that mistake - and there is a section on the menu that explains this concept.",

Service was great, would definitely return on my next trip to London!",

    "text": "Yep, Dishoom has a fan in me.With an overly trendy place in Shoreditch, you expect the worst. Higher unjustified prices, average quality and take-it-or-leave-it service. Not the case here, especially when you compare Dishoom against its traditional competitors over in Brick Lane. You see, Dishoom doesn't carry the price tag you'd expect, and is in fact a little bit cheaper - and a very respectable quality to boot. Yes, I admit, some of the menu names and descriptions are hard to fathom and err on the side of wanky, but don't be too put off.The drinks menu is fun, and you could easily just treat this place as a bar and leave very happy. Not cheap mind, but their cocktails are well made and imaginative. The food here ranges from ok to actually really rather good. My favourite was the lamb chop, closely followed by the biryani. I can forgive the average naan. Indian food done well, and without the grease.The place has an exciting feel to it. Certainly very different to the white table-clothed Indian restaurants you're used to - it's decked out in original decor that might just cause you to take a very long toilet break as you stop and look at/read the stuff on the wall. The bow-tied subservant waiters are gone too, replaced by the young/trendy type who strangely have the same hair cut (girls and boys), but they just about get it right - informative and not overly up their own arse. Which is a pleasant treat for Shoreditch.The courtyard is great for the warmer months.I'll be back.",

Nice selection of drinks and served fresh.Chicken tikka - nice flavor. spicy. Recommend getting the yogurt (raita) to cool down your mouth. Garlic naan pretty standard and good.Roomali roti was very nice change to naan. House black daal was my favorite. Not too spicy and a very large portion served.Chicken ruby was delicious. Similar to chicken tikka masala in my opinion. Great flavor and spice to it.",

    "text": "London's tidal wave of shabby chic, cultural-niche themed restaurants seems unstoppable. I'd classify Dishoom in this category. My rating is based on a dinner for 5 around 8pm on a Monday.Pros* Really tasty, freshly made inventive recipes. Big flavours and variety of textures.* Good, original cocktail selection* Well executed d\u00e9cor giving a believable ambiance to the facade.Cons* Staff seem employed for looks rather than ability/competence (more on that later, I appreciate that this seems to be the modus operandi of most of the East End these days)* Portions don't match the price - the 'leg of lamb' was \u00a321 and is meant for 2 sharing, yet it's just a decent serving for 1. Our waiter claimed only 1 person has finished it themselves before - seems unlikely chief. It also is a pile of shredded meat 'next to' an alarmingly bare looking bone - no visible signs that ever the twain had met.* \u00a0Side dishes are significantly overpriced - \u00a35 for coleslaw or Okra chips...I know the recession hit hard, but carrots, cabbage, mayo and pomegranate haven't gone through the roof just yet.* \u00a0The place is huge, so there is often a delay in ordering drinks. Our food came quite quickly but we waited 45 minutes for cocktails at one point.The overall experience was pretty good, really enjoyed the food, though it is definitely overpriced. The cocktails tasted great, especially the Badam Alexander and the 1850 Julep - both with plenty of booze.Our waiter was amiable yet \u00a0slightly incompetent. A common pairing. If you're going to wear a novelty santa hat you need to back your look up with unerring professionalism, otherwise you just seem a bit of a clown. And if you fail to clear glasses and food away until 30 minutes after the meal, fail to submit a drinks order completely and don't give change even after the 12.5% discretionary gratuity has been included and paid for, then I'm afraid you're not ready for maitre' d just yet.I'd go back for a light early evening dinner and one cocktail, keep it short and simple and be able to leave without clutching your wallet in alarm.",

    "text": "Loved this place! Went here with friends for a birthday and intend to go again soon.Obviously the food is fantastic, but it's also quite refreshing to find a place where the mocktails aren't a total rip off. While we waited for a table (dinner reservations are only available for groups of six or more) we had passionfruit sharbats - perfect for the warm evening and unlike anything else I'd ever had before. Fortunately, we didn't have to kill time drinking too many of these, and were shown to our table fairly promptly, despite it being dinner time on a Sunday.There were five of us in total, and our waiter was particularly helpful - advising us to try and pick as much variety as possible, and letting us know that we'd probably only need one or two servings of rice between us (we were about to order three bowls). When our food arrived it was amazing. It arrived surprisingly rapidly and tasted really fresh. Personally, I was feeling a bit under the weather, and while I'm sure that the food isn't exactly healthy or low calorie, it felt really nourishing and quite gentle on my stomach; something I wouldn't expect from Indian food, which can often be overpowering and heavy.Even though we ate quite a lot, for some reason we decided to order dessert as well. Quite a gluttonous move, so maybe go a bit easy on the main course if you want to sample the dessert menu as well! I chose the guju chocolate mousse - a rich, slightly salty mousse which comes with berries.Another good thing about Dishoom is that they don't automatically add on the service charge. We tipped our waiter generously because the service was so good, but it's still nice for it to be left to your discretion. I hate having to kick up a fuss when I've received below par service which I'm then expected to pay extra for.By the time we left, I was completely stuffed and I barely ate a thing the day after. But when my appetite returned, I wanted to go straight back to Dishoom!",

Luckily for me I stumbled on Dishoom which was hidden away down a side street that happened to catch me eye! Curry for breakfast, hell yeah!Service was polite and prompt, I didn't get the brush off treatment I have received elsewhere on asking for a table for one. So top marks there. I sat outside on their beautiful plant draped terrace, it felt a world away from London. I ordered steamed rice with Mattar Paneer and some house chai. The chai is absolutely delicious, aromatic, spicy but not too sweet. However it comes in a tiny portion, I could have easily enjoyed more.The food arrived quickly and was beautifully spiced and fresh tasting, the rice was delicate and light. I only wish I had had time to make a return visit, as there was so much on the menu I would have loved to try. I'd say it'd be a great spot to have \u00a0lunch with a group to get a few dishes to share.It was pretty pricy to my eye - but I'd say it's competitive for London prices, and there was a lovely atmosphere to the place so i was happy to spend.",

I had a chicken tikka wrap which served to be a reasonable lunch portion but definitely felt like I was still eating on the light side. It almost felt like eating a spring roll. I asked for extra chili pepper and mixed that in with the sweet tomato jam sauce and raised the spice level to my taste. I guess it turned out alright. So if you want a hip place (think Bill's brunch but for Indian food?) and don't need your food to be particularly interesting, it's great ambiance. Again, not worth the price for the food, but for the ambiance.",

And the staff are lovely - whoever did the hiring here definitely did a great job, as they all are personable, genuine and really go out the way to be friendly and make you feel comfortable. I already wanted to really love this place.I ordered the Mango Lassi to begin with, as I do enjoy a good Mango Lassi. However, this one won the award for the worst I've ever had. Boooo Hissss. It was weak, and though tasted yogurty, the mango was lacking.The lamb samosas weren't bad (and bonus points for the Gujarati filo), and the Pau Bhaji was yummy - I recommend that as a starter. The Chicken Ruby was also nice, albeit a bit on the heavy side. Overall, however, I wasn't blown away as the spice level was very mild.I did appreciate the menu maintains traditional integrity, omitting beef and pork from the menu (not exactly staples of the Indian diet), which is more than can be said for some other Indian restaurants.Overall, I would probably recommend Dishoom to somebody who wanted to sample Indian food for the first time, but I likely wouldn't eat there myself.. not because the service or setting isn't lovely, but because I don't feel the food was quite like home.",

The only thing I would recommend to Dishoom is to put more curries on their menus as there are only two curries. Everything else is more dry style think grilled or Biryani (rice pots). I am not a fan of Biryanis I find them to dry. Chaijito was very yummy which is an indian take on a mojitos with mint, coriander, chair syrup, ginger and lime.",

I'm not a huge fan of Indian food because it \"greases the tracks.\" However, given the abundance of Indian restaurants in London, I had to give this best-in-class restaurant a try. This place doesn't take reservations and is extremely popular so we ended up waiting for a very long time before being seated. Despite the very long wait, the food exceeded everyone's high expectations and was well worth the wait. The food was absolutely best-in-class and I enjoyed all of the dishes including the classic and unforgettable \"white man dish\" aka chicken tikka masala.",

    "text": "Meh. The first time I went to Dishoom about 3 years back I was blown away. I did an unconventional breakfast with a big group of people at the restaurant off of St Martin's Lane. The chai tea was delightful and I remember leaving with a full and happy belly.This time around, I guess a number of meh parts about the meal contributed to the perfect storm.1) Weekend brunch is served til noon. \u00a0Okay, you may say, just get up and go - but on a Saturday mid-day, sometimes I just want want to sleep in and crawl to a hare of the dog breakfast for some eggs. Luckily I showed up early for a breakfast date planned for noon with a girlfriend and held the waiter hostage with promises that he would continue serving us even as she arrived at 12:01.2) Food: Actually not bad at all - the price is right here and I had the Akuri spicy scramble - only thing is the food came out kind of cold and when I was done, I was still starving. This sounds like a waaah complaint but I found myself looking longingly over at the Albion only across the road, serving brunch all day long in perfect proportions. \u00a0Next time I'll review after choosing differently, perhaps more wisely. When I finished this course, even if I was hoping for more food it was going to be off the regular lunch/dinner menu which I just wasn't prepared for so early (ish) in the weekend day.3) Drinks -The Dhoble - the description of a refreshing breakfast coctail of OJ, gin, maraschino liqueur won me over - but first sip was wholly alcohol. This is not what I meant by Hare of the Dog! \u00a0At 9 quid I wouldn't say this is a must - next time I'll leave the day drinking up to one of places nearby, like the rooftop Boundary around the corner. All in all I was a bit let down this time - I think I'll hold off on the Dishoom brunch and stick to dinner for the next round...",

    "text": "For those impatient food review readers, I'll help you out and give you the bottom line right away: DISHOOM IS WELL WORTH A VISIT WITH EVERYTHING BEING BEYOND DELICIOUS. WAIT IN AN HOUR LINE BY ALL MEANS, IT'S A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE Now for the normal folk. Dishoom takes the traditional indian vibe and classic entrees and takes them up to entirely different level of flavor and overall ambiance. Dishoom tries very hard to transport their customers with not only the menu design/descriptions of the items, but to the overall decor. The vibe echoed from this place is worth a good amount of pounds alone. I honestly felt that I was no longer in London when I first walked through this establishment's pristine doors. The food, as above stated, is simply out of this world. Everything is perfectly spiced with an array of flavors and spices present in any single dish on the menu. I have been to Dishoom three times, once for breakfast, lunch and dinner. As I am a writing this review I already know that I am going tomorrow for lunch. For the sake of clarity, I will just talk about what I had for lunch and dinner since the menus are the same. I have gotten the Murgh Malai, the Chicken Tikka, the side green side, the garlic naan, and the Bhel. The Murgh Malai and the Chicken Tikka are both chicken dishes that are beyond flavorful, aromatic, \u00a0and juicy. The chicken is just succulent; hands down the best chicken I have ever had. The garlic naan is served piping hot so you know it is fresh, and boy is it delicious. The Bhel is this puffed rice salad with spices, pomegranate, and mint, and it is a great refreshing salad as is the green salad.Now to the drinks. The drink menu is absolutely divine, and boy is there an array of options. Both times for lunch and dinner, I ordered the Bombay Pimm's since I cannot get enough of it. It either comes in a glass or you can order a \"jug\"of it. I considered ordering a jug the second time I was here, but considering I was alone, didn't want to seem like an alcoholic, and wanted to avoid any possible incident, I decided to restrain myself. I could honestly, without shame or regret, drink an entire barrel full of the Bombay Pimm's if nobody was around that I could cause harm to. How can you go wrong with saffron gin, mint, pomegranate, ginger beer, and citrus?All-in-all, and certainly needless to say, just swing by. If it could live here I would. The drinks are delicious (and certainly could be endless), the food is so delicious, that \u00a0you may honestly moan with delight in your seat considering the sensual mouth-orgy that is going on due to the knockout deliciousness of the entrees, and the ambiance just makes you take everything in leaving you sitting there well beyond the point when your check arrived. If I could be a part owner/investor I would, but im broke so...Just come and transport yourself to a magical place. All it honestly takes to change your life and become a convert is to just walk through the door.",

I can say that whilst the d\u00e9cor and western style atmosphere is as far removed from India as Columbus thinking he'd arrived there when he's actually discovered the Americas, Dishoom get it right when it comes to the authentic taste of India: spice blends that are unique and exciting; fresh simple, top quality ingredients and menu items that you wouldn't usually get from the generic high street British Indian restaurant. My top tips for dining at Dishoom are:Breakfast - it's all about the Bacon naan (yes, I did say Bacon naan) with their homemade masala chai - the perfect way to start any weekend breakfast/brunch (although they do serve breakfast 7 days a week) Dinner - The Roomali Roti's are amazing and the perfect accompaniment to a Mahi Tikka (Fish curry) and Mattar Paneer (Indian cottage cheese and peas) Beer - make sure you try their special Dishoom Pale ale which is brewed in collaboration with Beavertown brewery; it's less gassy and suits the blends of the spices much better than Kingfisher.",

    "text": "Shoreditch Dishoom is actually a little bit cooler, bigger and for some reason I like it better than Covent Garden (maybe cause it's less rushed and crammed all the time).Normally I wouldn't copy paste a review for another but below is my review for the Dishoom in Covent Garden, which still applies to Shoreditch's one :) Bear out the wait! It's never as long as they say, and worth it for the free chai (dirty if you are lucky). If there is a place in Central London I like to eat in more, I haven't found it. Having loved and lived in Mumbaj it makes me nostalgic for lunch and dinner dates in Cafe Britannia and other Parsi caf\u00e9s. If you or members of your group aren't used to eating Indian food, this is a great introduction with something for everyone. I've brought family, friends, and dates. Kick it off with a cocktail, all are good, but I especially recommend an off the menu item called the 'Dhoble' (Dub-lay; named after Mumbai's infamous Polic Commissioner)- just ask them to ask the bar staff.I'm a big fan of the pau bhaji/bhel/vada pau for starters. Highly recommend the Biryani or Bhoti kabobs for mains. No order will be complete without the house Black Daal (my Keralan GF adores it). Remember it's easier and cheaper to share- most dishes can serve two. Mop it all up with a roomali roti (handkerchief roti- ask to see them make it, it's epic).Truthfully dessert isn't as strong as the rest. Go for the kulfi on a stick. Chai is too small a portion in my opinion, coffee is fine but not done in traditional pulled fashion. Just grab cocktail 2 or 3 instead :)I'd be surprised if it comes to more than \u00a330pp :)",

The food is a different from what you'd find at a curry house (and curries are only a very small part of the menu - think more grilled sauteed or tandoori type of dishes). It's ordered like small plates - choose 2-3 per person and go to town on the array. The meats can be hit or miss, some were super tender and falling off the bone, others were dry and chewy. However, every dish was extremely flavorful, lots of kick with the heat and heavy on the spices than most. They go similarly extreme on the cream and butter factor, but in the end with small plates this is a good thing... At such concentrations of flavor, a little goes a long way!",

During the wait, a server was kind enough to be passing out mini chai teas or a type of shot to the people waiting in line. Also, the people waiting to be seated are allowed to go to the bar area first and order a drink, which definitely helps pass the time. I ordered a rose drink, which was a fragrant rosy yogurt drink and a perfect alternative for those who aren't feeling in the mood for alcohol.The d\u00e9cor was impressively well coordinated -- I'd describe it as a rustic shabby chic, with its quirky lettering on the walls (\"no flirting with the cashier, no heavy petting\" -- haha!). The food was pretty tasty too. I recommend the chicken tikka, which is one of their family handed down recipes. The chicken's texture was succulent, and so soft that when I dipped it in the sauce they would split in half. The garlic naan was also very good; it came with its own yogurt based sauce but I chose to dip it instead in the trio of three sauces that are offered to every table, since they were the more flavor packed alternative. I also got a lamb biryani, which was a combination slow roasted lamb and flavored rice in a pot. It was also good, but the real winners for me were the chicken tikka and the naan.For dessert, I ordered the chocolate cake with chili ice cream -- quite an odd combination, but they somehow suited each other. As a fan of lighter, and more refreshing dishes though, I preferred the mango kulfi I ordered, which is the Indian version of ice cream on a stick.",

Clearly we should have been more specific, as we were then moved to the loser basement space for those of us apparently not cool enough to be seated in the general restaurant area. Again, we were seated in a subpar, half empty dark area away from the general crowds. This was disappointing, as we were looking forward to enjoying the restaurant experience, including the ambience.

This was my first stop and meal in the area before drinks at Happiness Forgets, so I was super excited to try some of their dishes.Must Try's:- Butter-bhutta: next level corn on the cob. Love the chili, butter, lime on top of the grilled corn. I am drooling thinking of this.- Black House Daal: simmered over 24 hours, there is a reason this is highlighted and outlined on the menu. Pure dopeness. Trust me. Taste the creaminess in it. Tastes like winning the lottery twice.- Lamb boti kabab: are you serious???? I'm not even a fan of lamb and this was a standout. The meat is smothered with this delicious spice rub that penetrates it all the way to its core. You like boring drab dry meat? This dish is not for you.- Ruby Chicken: for all you basic Indian food lovers, this is your default chicken tikka masala and it's the best you will ever had- Bowl of greens: sounds basic, but come on, get your veggie on with some grilled broccoli, snow pea, and spinach dressed in some delicious lime and chili sauce. If you're like me and don't get eating bread or rice (I'm weird, I know), this is your go to side dish.Also shoutout to the beverage game here. Watermelon drink (non-alcoholic) and the toddy were also friggin mind blowing.",

We did, and they were. Our wait was only an hour compared to the three hour wait that we left for the few nights prior. The wait IS worth it, however. Every. Single. Dish. Is perfection.

The spices are too much and after the half of the meal, all 3 of us lost interest in food, just the black pepper bomb in all 7 dishes and not enough happiness signal reached to the brains. I think we weren't full but done with too much spices of the same kind.The beer was from London, and, not impressive, the blueberry beer came in a can, felt CHEAP.The food side was underwhelming in the end. But, our waiter and the beverage waitress are real charmers.The foul tactic at the entrance door was really not nice. The greeting staff said the waiting is 1 hour 25 minutes, but, if we ordered the drinks inside (at the bar area) the waiting will be shorter. Indeed, whether you order the drinks or not, within 25 minutes, we were seated. And, the exit is on to the main street, and, the arriving guests might never guess but think that the place is fully packed as they see no one comes out through the entrance. That could sell one or two more cocktails or beers, but, that is clearly a deception.Unique enough to try out, but, I wonder if I would go back to try their food again. But, the deluded people put on their smile all the way. I guess they succeed in casting some good spell.",

Our waiter left us in the middle of taking orders to do something else. Dishes did not come in the order we asked for. I don't know what to say about food, it is not even close to Indian Irani as they claim for, sambosa was horrible, fried ocra was half salty and dry, fish tikka was horribly grilled, with no taste, needed a lot of hot chutney to take the soapy taste away. I assume they have other branches. This was a complete waste for us visiting London for a week only. \u00a0Avoid this place!",

As we didn't know what to order, and everything looked delicious, we simply went crazy, but everything we ordered was delicious. This is why these are opened all over London, they're simply that good and really unique. I think the prices are pretty reasonable, especially if you don't go totally nuts with what you order. Wines and beers are around \u00a35 and a lot of the dishes are just a few quid. The spicy lamb chops were excellent. Definitely a good portion for just \u00a311.90. The House Black Daal was excellent, as were the lamb samosas. Paneer Tikka was tasty too. Really everything was very tasty. Order a bunch of things that look tasty and you won't be disappointed. We also really liked how the service was quick and food just comes at you in an avalanche. When we came in there was no wait, but I imagine even if there was a wait it would move quickly.Dishoom come to America!",

    "text": "Gluttons* of England, Gluttons of Ireland,Gluttons of every land and clime,Hearken to my joyful tidingsOf the scrumptious breakfast time!Dishoom is continuing to expand across the city of London! This Bombay-style caf\u00e9, which started in Covent Garden more than half a decade ago, opened locations in Shoreditch, King's Cross, and Carnaby over the past few years, for a total of 4 restaurants in London! Dishoom is modeled after iconic caf\u00e9s that were established and operated in Bombay (now Mumbai, India) in the mid-to-late 1900s by Zoroastrian merchants from Iran (known throughout the Indian subcontinent as Parsis - literally meaning Persians). It is quite a unique blend of bustling energy and a relaxed, laid back vibe. The food at Dishoom would be described as \"non-traditional\" in relation to the food offerings at the multitude of Indian restaurants that operate all over the UK. Breakfast is the best meal with the most typical of Parsi dishes. My personal favorite is the Keema Per Eedu, spiced minced chicken, interspersed with diced chicken liver, and topped with two fried eggs. This protein-rich deliciousness is served with two buttered pau buns. Another favorite of mine is the Akuri, a heap of spiced scrambled eggs also served with pau buns. The Kejriwal (fried eggs with chilli cheese toast) and the Bombay omelette are mad tasty, and the fire toast comes with a pineapple-pink-peppercorn jam, which is some of the most delightful combinations of sweet and spicy flavors I have ever experienced. \"Oh man\", declared my taste-buds, \"that pink peppercorn and pineapple is my jam!\" The only slight disappointment was the Dishoom slaw. It is supposed to be a creamy coleslaw with pomegranate seeds in it, and there were literally 3 pomegranate seeds in the bowl full of slaw; not even joking! In a city like London, where an abundance of exceptional restaurants makes it impossible to pick a favorite, I find myself drawn to one of the Dishoom locations when I have time (and stomach capacity) for only one meal. *Note: I'd much rather call myself a \"glutton\" than a \"foodie\"; it just is a more apt description of what people like myself are.",

    "text": "This is my third time coming to this Dishoom location, as I make it my priority to visit any time I am in London because the food is AMAZING, but the reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of the 5 it had in my heart before is because of an experience I had on April 20th. My boyfriend and I arrived around 8:30pm to the restaurant knowing it would most likely be a long wait because of how popular the restaurant is and the time of day, but this was his first time in London and I was determined to have him try one of the best restaurants in the city. We wait for about an hour but we're offered complimentary drinks and able to look at the menu beforehand, so we had no issue with that. This is where things went left. When we finally were seated, our waiter asked if we'd been there before and after he hurriedly explained the menu it took him another 20 minutes to take our order (after we flagged him down of course). After we received our food from another waiter we did not see our waiter for the duration of our meal. No refills, no asking if the meal was good and everything was to our liking, nothing. He constantly checked on his other 2 tables and laughed it up with his co-workers. He even reached over our table to give his co-worker a receipt but didn't address us at all. It wasn't until we asked another waiter to get a manager so we could explain the situation. that he finally came to the table, but this time...only to clear our plates. He still said nothing. The manager had to check us out and offered a free dessert for the problem, but it was not about a free dessert, as we declined. It was about the blatant disrespect and overt dislike for people of color from this waiter that we wanted to bring to the manager of the establishment. It's an Indian restaurant for goodness sake. Do not hire people who clearly are not willing to serve everyone.",

My daughter insisted on Neebu Pani. My daughter finally relented after multiple times saying she just wanted water. The Neebu Pani was way too bitter for her -- and the waitress did not inquire, let alone apologize for being so pushy. This was the entire meal -- we were a family of 4.

    "text": "I was really excited about the new Shoreditch branch of this super smart-casual Covent Garden Bombay Cafe style cafe-bar-restaurant, having reviewed that one so positively as a restaurant. Our experience there this week did not disappoint \u00a0the food was the same tasty, sensitively spiced and priced, top quality fusion of cuisines and time periods, such as the simple but delicious masala (king) prawn main dish with its garnish and dip, the bowl of almost purple bowl of well-simmered house 'black daal', and the garlic naan with its minced garlic butter and fresh coriander sprinkle. The service was active and excellent as was the lovely local pale ale we drank from bottles.The added ingredient at the Shoreditch branch was the restaurant's post-industrial warehouse chic style setting with its large windows facing Shoreditch High Street and its prettier heated courtyard bar entrance opposite the cool Conran Boundary Hotel's Albion restaurant. Inside the place was typically 'decorated' with wide aluminum ceiling pipes, most of which can't surely have a function,dark tables of all but the largest cover sizes, some in a slightly raised back area with people-watching views, and a big clock that looks like it could have actually been at the station in Bombay during colonial times. So although the place is less glitzy than its Covent Garden sister, it is both in keeping with both its current Shoreditch location and creative plus City fringe clientele and perhaps also more sympathetic with its cultural-historical references: A kind of 'Pizza Very Far East'? The only downside was that (just towards the close) the coutyard was closed and the exit, and hence only smoking area, was next to a strip club, which led to an unnecessary if polite exchange between my female smoking companion and one of their bouncers \u00a0it would be more ideal as a fire exit!",

Dishoom set the bar to a new high for Indian (and Pakistani!) food for me. There's usually quite a long line at Dishoom - albeit a good sign - as they don't take reservations at regular meal times. I got really lucky though. I went on a Monday with a friend and somehow we only waited about 2 minutes despite a full restaurant..(I still don't know how we instantly got a table!) I guess our buzzer went off by accident - don't really know. ANYWAYS, the food was so delish. We had copious amounts of the keema pau which I would be confident to say was the best dish/best food in the world. For mains I had tender lamb cubes and my friend had the chicken equivalent. Both were superb - succulent, flavourful, juicy, and pretty much just a party in my mouth. The atmosphere is great - it's got the whole nice restaurant feel without burning TOO big a hole in your wallet. Also before I forget - we ordered some samosas which were impressive but I've got to say not the best I've had (but that might be because I've had a lot of samosas in my day...). All in all, an excellent dining experience. Make sure you give Dishoom a try - and don't hesitate putting up with the wait however long it is. It's definitely worth it!",

So I am a fresh off they boat Indian, hence uber critical of Indian food, especially the North Indian variety, which actually the Pakistani places down Commercial road are the best.So anyway , we ordered vada pau, pau- bhaji, kheema pau, as starters. Must say of the three only vada pau was worth any money. In fact feel they have changed the recipe to make it more like \u00e0 Mumbai vada, with all the chutney etc. Pau bhsji and Kheema both bland and tasteless. Thereafter we got lamb boti, prawn koliwada, black daal and rumali roti. Of these three only prawn koliwada is worth a mention. The lamb was unseasoned, not properly marinated and dry and the daal had too much tomato paste. The waitress was very kind though and didn't charge us for the lamb. Service has improved and better than Covent Garden, food is a hit and miss but prices reasonable and portions generous",

    "text": "I don't get the hype. I guess if you're into average-tasting, overpriced Indian food in a trendy setting with neglectful service, this is your place.We waited for 1.5 hours for a two-person table on a Wednesday night. We stood outside for a while, but they brought out some warm chai and a sherry shot. Okay, despite the wait, it's s good start -- full of promise. We spent the bulk of the waiting period standing around the bar area, where they encourage you to buy drinks and snacks while you wait. (Cha-ching!) Eventually our buzzer vibrated and we were led to a downstairs table. They have seating areas upstairs, downstairs, and even in a detached tent. The environment is chic and trendy, but I found the actual substance of the Dishoom experience to be lacking.Service was awful. No one ever came to refill our waters until I flagged someone down at the end of our meal and I asked for it. And instead of asking if we even wanted dessert, they just left us with a dessert menu, even though all we wanted was the check. After waiting for a while (guess he wasn't too interested in taking our dessert orders either) we had to flag him down again and ask for the check. They automatically add on a 12.5% optional service charge -- perhaps they think that since few people would opt out, they're safe with giving subpar service?They don't ask about your preferred spice levels. I would have preferred my food to have been spicer. We ordered the black daal, the royal chicken, a garlic naan, and the roti. The servings were so tiny, we contemplated ordering a lamb biryani too but decided against it when we saw it arrive at the table next to us.More than once, while taking a bite of the chicken curry, I got a cardamom pod, a big slice of ginger, and other chunks of spices in my mouth. If you're going to give me such a small dollop of food, I would at least expect all of it to be edible.The black daal tasted decent but was nothing special. It actually arrived as a light brown color, was waterier than I expected (for something supposedly stewing for 24 hours), and strongly resembled Mexican refried beans.The roti was borderline awful. You only get one large piece in an order. It's extremely thin, extremely dry, and kind of crispy. It tastes very plain. You'd be better off mopping your food up with flour tortillas (for less price too). The garlic naan was a similarly paltry portion -- two tiny triangles in the basket. The naan was flat and dense -- unlikely that it was baked in a tandoori oven. The best part about this place was the free wifi.",

    "text": "I've been waiting to go to Dishoom for about two years. I had heard it was expensive and that better Indian food was to be (easily) had for the price. But ... I still wanted to go. A lot. When my mom visited - an avid Indian food fan and a girl who grew up on adventure books of the British-era India - I finally had a solid reason to do it.We tried to avoid busiest times so we could get a seat out in the patio, which is fantastically outfitted to feel like 19th century India with lots of wicker and greenery and brass. We still had to wait about 10 mins but had a cocktail from the bar before heading to our \"seats\".The downside to the eclectically styled patio is that the seats suck. Like royally. They *look* pretty cool and seem fun but the aren't fun to sit in and even worse to eat a meal from. Low slung and laid waaaay back, we perched awkwardly and uncomfortably on the edge the entire time. Ick.Then I found out why it's so expensive - it's \"sharing plates\" These extortionately priced menu items can be found masquerading as tapas, and they are designed to get you to order 6-7 to share between 4 people at \u00a310+ a pop. Boo. Plus our party didn't want all of the same things.So we ended up ordering just what we wanted (4 plates plus I HAD to have some cheesy naan) despite the waiter pushing and pushing to order more, more, more! \u00a0Spoiler alert: we had plenty of food. Another crappy thing about sharing plates as that the kitchen use it as an excuse to send the food out whenever they damn well please. So my husband's sandwich came out 15 minutes before anything else. Sort of awkward for him to eat while we waited and waited for our food.So ... add a couple cocktails each to the bill and we easily spent probably \u00a3150 or more. Yeesh. Nice atmosphere and nice food and glad I went, but certainly not desperate to go back.",

Personally I despise waiting in line for anything but she was willing to go early to queue up, so I was sold! She showed up at 6 PM on a Wednesday and they offered her a table immediately, so I guess the lines don't start that early at the Shoreditch location. We tried the Okra Fries (spicy, crunchy, tasty), Prawn Koliwada (can you really go wrong with fried shrimp?) the Chicken Ruby, Paneer Tikka, and of course the 'house specialty' Black House Daal. Perhaps it is a red flag when a restaurant's specialty is an Indian basic as daal. It was good, but not mind-blowingly so. The chicken was okay but a bit spicy, and the paneer was hearty but again, missing the expected wow factor. We also ordered lamb kebabs which the waiter forgot to bring, but he was very sweet and apologetic and gave us a free dessert instead, so he made up for his mistake with the Memsahib's Mess.In all the food was enjoyable, but I just can't understand why people would queue for hours for this place. London is covered in delicious Indian restaurants where you can get far more food for a better price.",

If you're going as a group, delegate the weak one (whoever gets off work first) to queue!The atmosphere here is energetic and it's full of young professionals gathered at the bar waiting for their tables so once the host staff hand you your little vibrating black box of joy, feel free to join them you young go-getter, you!Cocktails here are fairly priced and some quite unique. If I recall correctly I had a chilli martini and it rocked! We were seated in just under an hour and the time seemed to fly past so it was no big deal. The food was well worth it and once seated everything arrived very quickly. Considering the very obvious trendy atmosphere and decor, I didn't expect too much from the food. I'm by no means an expert but have eaten my fair share of Indian food and prefer to hunt out authentic fare so expected the food here to be a somewhat 'Westernised' version of Indian food both in presentation and taste. This was the case to a lesser extent than I had anticipated and the food was thoroughly enjoyable. It was nice to see some tasty desserts on the menu. Although mostly not of Indian origin, they were delicious nevertheless.The price was very reasonable and our waiter was the happiest man I've ever met which made the evening even more enjoyable. Service was included (thank you I love you London, making the awkward far less awkward.) Would definitely go back again.",

    "text": "First of all, if you're coming to Dishoom for dinner (particularly on the weekend), be prepared to wait! Saturdays and Sundays after 7pm, expect an 1hr - 1hr 1/2 wait at a minimum. Luckily, while you wait outside, the wait staff offers complimentary refreshments such as sherry or lemonade, which definitely makes the wait more bearable! Inside, you wait at the bar for additional time during which you can order drinks or starters. I started with Pau Bhaji - a mashed veggie mix served with two buttered buns. It was tasty but I wasn't a huge fan of the texture, which was a bit thin for my taste. Not long after I finished I was seated at my table, which happened to be downstairs. Unsurprisingly, with a place this busy they try to fit in as many tables as possible, but it certainly didn't feel crammed. I ordered the Dishoom Chicken Tikka and some garlic naan. Despite how busy the place was, the food came rather quickly. Honestly, I was a bit underwhelmed at first glance! The portion size was small, and was served with a pittance of vegetables. That said, it was absolutely delicious. The chicken was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The naan wasn't quite as fluffy as I'd have liked, it was a tad over-grilled.For dessert I had Memsahib's Mess, which includes fresh cream, strawberries, and crushed meringues. \u00a0I found the cream to be really heavy in the dessert and would have liked it to have been more whipped as to provide a little more contrast with the crunch of the meringue. I'm sure I'll return, but probably with a bigger group. Dishoom is definitely a better place for a group with whom to share and be loud than for an intimate dining experience.",

    "text": "During my trip to London, my friend took me to this place really raving about it. I don't enjoy eating Indian food outside very much because it's usually the same everywhere. But this place was pretty exceptional!We went for dinner time, the line was very long and started from outside the building. Probably waited about 45 minutes to an hour in total. I got a beer from across the street to keep myself occupied while waiting. When you get a little closer to the entrance they offer you some small drinks- and brandy and juice (or lemonadeI forgot what). Once inside (which I had to chug my beer bc they wouldn't let me bring it in, but it's okay because the guy was a good sport about it), you wait more but you can order drinks. Their chai is phenomenal! I got the Bombay Pimms bc I thought it would be fun to try the whole East meets West thing. Anyways, that was good too! Surprisingly strong bc I remember feeling buzzed by the time I was done...It's pretty dark inside and feels fancy like classic and rich. You would take someone on a date here to really impress them. Where we were seated, we could see them making all the naan, that was exciting for me. My friends and I (4 of us total) ordered probably 6 to 7 dishes and were stuffed after. I freaking adored the paneer naan. Yes you heard me...whatever chicken we ordered was my favorite as well. I found the shrimp to be too spicy for me (but I don't usually do very spicy).Definitely glad we went here, we had a great meal and were able to just walk to nearby bars to enjoy the rest of our night in Shoreditch!",

Everything we had was delicious though. We also had the Fish Tikka, Mattar Paneer, and Garlic Naan. I want to come back and try the Fried Okra and Pau Bhaji.The drink menu is to die for as well. I had the Mango and Fennel Lassi, which was an amazing flavor combination. It was great to have a yogurt drink to balance out the heat from the hot orange-colored sauce that they bring to your table.If I lived here, I'd eat here once a week for sure!",

We read warnings about long wait times. The restaurant does not do reservations and it's true you have to queue to keep your reservation. We arrived to find a long queue. I didn't want to stand in line but the friendly hostess assured us in 30 minutes we would be at the front of the line which means you can then go to the bar and get a digital beeper. While in line, they offered us a variety of complimentary beverages. After 30 minutes, we made it to the front of the line and graduated into the bar. There we enjoyed a few drinks while we waited another 30 minutes for our table.Once we sat down, our service was prompt and friendly. Our Server, Grace, was super friendly, helpful and prompt. She strongly recommended the Black Daal. I must say, I'm not a big fan of Daal... But this was simply the best Daal I've ever had and the best dish of the night. We ordered a chicken Ruby dish... Awesome. Not too spicy but with a nice kick. We ordered the lamb Sheesh Kabob... Tasty but slightly dry. And a veggie salad and some roti. Absolutely delicious. The place feels fresh and hip and the atmosphere was young and professional. I can't wait to go back!",

We made it in just under the wire for Saturday breakfast with friends, and we were absolutely delighted with the offerings. It's not a super extensive list, but they do what they do quite well. My pal and I both ordered the egg and bacon naan (served with a wonderful spicy jam) and then the housemade granola + yogurt and fruit to split. We both wished we'd ordered our own granola, as 1. it was fantastic and 2. the portion was a bit small for 5 quid. However, it was tasty. The boys enjoyed the bigger breakfast plates and were also very satisfied. Service was swift, friendly and we were seated immediately and prompted for drinks. The bloody mary was very different (in a great way) and all the chai and coffee were well received, despite being served in glass. There's something I can't quite grasp about hot drinks served in glass, but that's how they do it here. Highly recommend for breakfast, it's a different spin and one worth trying most definitely. Just don't skimp on that granola, you'll regret it when you try to order more and it's past breakfast-time!",

The menu definitely looked promising: kheema pav, far far, etc. Not everything's in there, but there's enough. I am not a purist anyway.The drinks on the menu are good. Especially, the chais--regular, chocolate, Baileys, the lot. The lassis are average, I'd say. In terms of food, what stands out is the okra, koliwada prawns, britannia biryani, mattar paneer, spicy lamb chops, & the frankies. It isn't the regular London curry house fare, but it is good. What really surprised me were the desserts: memsahib's mess & malai kulfi were amazing. But what most people do go here for is the eclectic decor & the outdoor seating area. Both are worth the premium that you pay for. Good service and a great place to catchup with friends.",

The food is strictly okay. The over expectation probably added to the disappointment levels. I had the koliwada prawns, naan, chicken and vada pav. Nothing except the vada pav left me dazzled. This place does make you love it though. And for someone from Mumbai, it makes you very very nostalgic - the service is super quick, staff is very busy, there's Thums Up Float and Nimbu Paani on the menu, the decor bears some touches of an Irani restaurant. All remind you of home. I am particularly thankful to Dishoom, and I am not being dramatic here, for including Thums Up and Malabar Coffee to their menu *tears of joy*.Should probably try their Irani food and breakfast spread next time. It's all about second chances.",

We came here for lunch on our last day before heading out to Heathrow...we had our luggage in tow; it was a bit of a haul and we were put on the waiting list (didn't make a reservation) about 45 minutes. My family wanted to ditch and go across the street but I held to my guns and we stuck it out. It only took about 20 minutes because I optioned to sit out in the patio. We ordered the calamari, chicken curry, lamb chops, lamb kebobs, and the grilled shrimp, rice, naan, and the dishoom sauce. We ate everything. There was nothing left.

The restaurant is meant to imitate and maintain \"dying breed of Bombay caf\u00e9s.\" From walking in, the decor and set up was very reminiscent of that in India. From the ambiance to the furniture, signs for caf\u00e9 rules, and the silverware; the environment was very well considered.The menu itself had many items that included traditional Indian/Bombay cuisine as well as fusion dishes. I tried the Lamb Raan, which included a sandwich with minced lamb, veges and chutneys; Bombay cole slaw; and salty snacks on the side. The flavor was not the best I've had for Indian, but the execution was very strong and well presented. The Bombay cole slaw was surprisingly good, seeming to be made with masala powder in the standard recipe. The Chaijito (mojito with chai syrup and ginger) was pretty good as well.The best was the chai at the end, made authentically. Will definitely be returning to try more of the menh when back in London!",

I love Indian food in general, and this was definitely great, but maybe it was that I'd come with inflated expectations (Dishoom came repeatedly, repeatedly, repeatedly, recommended by everyone I knew), but honestly, I just thought it was good, definitely above average, indian cuisine.The vibes of the place were great, the chai was tasty, the food was flavorful, but I wouldn't wait more than 30 minutes to eat here. Everything I had was great, especially the Murgh Malai. This was definitely a table favorite. I kept seeing recommendations for the black dahl, but I have never been partial to dahl and this dish changed nothing. (If you don't like dahl, don't expect that you will like this, it does taste just like dahl.) Food was delicious! But again, I didn't think this was mind-blowing in any respect, and I don't think I really was exposed to any flavors I hadn't previously experienced at other good Indian restaurants. It certainly is worth trying, but it isn't worth a long wait.",

Once seated you can't go wrong. We ordered the chicken tikka, masala prawns, lamb biryani, chicken ruby, black house daal, bowl of greens and garlic naan. All delicious but my favorite was the lamb biryani. I wish we had ordered two orders of naan instead of one to dip in the sauces.Great meal! Can't miss if you are in London.",

My boyfriend got a Dishoom IPA which was delish - I ordered a bellini cocktail which was crazily sweet.We were led to our table on the outside patio (fully enclosed - except for the sliding doors which weren't working properly on this particular night = winter cold draft). Service was slow - and my boyfriends glass of wine was served with a massive crusty food fingerprint smudge. Dishes we ordered were forgotten on both our table and the table next to us - the servers had to be reminded and finally came out at the end of our meal. That said, the food itself was AMAZING!!!- Black dal - Traditional style, smooth and delicious. Watch out for all the butter in this bad boy!- Lamb Raan - My boyfriend lived in India for two years and LOVES this dish - the most amazing succulent, slow marinated and tandoor cooked leg of lamb. It falls off the bone!- Chicken ruby - Classic English style curry.- Chicken Tikka skewer - Succulent chunks of chicken perfectly cooked in the tandoor- Rumali roti - Thin bread that unfolds like a giant napkin - much less filling than naan.- Garlic naan - The classic for dipping into a curryThere are three locations in London, but the Shoreditch one seems to be the most popular. This is a must visit for Indian food lovers.",

Waited about an hour for a seat. They have, however, cracked the mystery of how to provide great customer service in a busy restaurant. From the complimentary chai shots served to those waiting in line to the knowledgable bar and table staff who seemed genuinely passionate about their roles, this is really a stand out place. They also have lots of vegetarian options and you can have a good meal for two plus drinks for around \u00a335. Check it out.",

Even though I was only dining by myself, I still had to wait about 20 minutes or so before a table was available for me. I sat in the adjacent sun room, of sorts, that is just outside the main entrance of the restaurant. Once seated, I ordered the bhel puri appetizer to start, and then the paneer tikka with rice and garlic naan on the side (because, ya know, you can never have too many carbs). The bhel puri was pretty good and the paneer was just as I imagined it would be: a little dry but rubbed nicely with the tikka masala mixture. Portions were large and the service was quite good. As weird it sounds also, the bathrooms were also nice, and I liked their old-fashioned toilet tanks and wooden seats. You can certainly get much cheaper Indian food in the area, but I think this place is worth a visit if you're looking for a more posh dining experience.",

We came at around 11:30am and we're promptly seated to enjoy one of the best lunches I've had during my trip to London.My two friends and I ordered so much food, the waiter was questioning our judgement. Even though he was right and we tapped out with a good amount left, he also gave us a bowl of raita on the house. So... essentially he added to our pile of food.Everything is amazing so you can't go wrong with anything you order. I personally got the chicken ruby, garlic naan, and pau bhaji. Everyone raves about the chicken ruby and I also wanted a curry type dish to dip my naan in, but the true star of everything I ordered was the pau bhaji. A curry is a curry but the pau bhaji I haven't had anywhere else.My friends got the chicken biryani, lamb samosas, cheese naan, cucumber salad, house black daal, chili and cheese toast, and paneer tikka. One of my friends also ordered the house chai which was delicious and has free refills! Needless to say, this place is worth the hype. I had incredibly high expectations and it met them. The service was also excellent with the free raita and our server kept our waters constantly refilled.",

I've had Indian food in LA, NY, DC, Virginia, Tanzania, every gosh-darn place I've lived (unfortunately India is not on that list) and still Dishoom is \u00a0a top two in my life. First, the ambience is really elegant and comfortable (except for the privileged jerk who was seated next to our table who treated the servers in an incorrigible way). Despite having to deal with the prick, the staff was gracious and patient. Like what many reviewers say, this place has an hour long (or more) line but they gave us chai tea for free as we waited. We ordered their signature dishes: lamb raan, black dahl. No words can describe the flavors experiences from the lamb tan. It was exquisite. As for the black dahl, my husband threatened to become a vegetarian if he could have this dish every day, and the man is a tried and true carnivore! I've never been to a place where the side dish was actually the centerpiece of our meal. We couldn't have enough of it! Great Indian food and if you're a visitor in London looking to experience the best Indian food there, like we were, look no further.",

Service was fast and friendly. They have it down to a science but the only theory you need to know is that they make amazing, mouth watering food.Starting with the fried okra that was well seasoned along with three dipping sauces. Then came the heavy hitters of spicy chicken tikka masala, perfectly baked garlic naan and lamb biryani. The biryani was served in a clay pot sealed with dough to lock in the warm goodness. Tender chunks of lamb accompanied the beautiful coloured rice. A cool raita helped it all go down.Let's not forget about their interesting drink menu, featuring traditional Indian drinks or jazzing up classics like their sweet and smooth take on the Old Fashioned. Before finishing the meal and seeing the relatively inexpensive bill for a full meal with cocktails, I already proclaimed my desire to return. I can't wait to try more from their tempting kitchen.",

    "text": "Ok, okay yeah you probably know that this place is hyped. But, is it worth it?Ultimately, I would have to say yes, even considering that my friend and I showed up without a reservation at around 7:15PM on a Thursday, and then waited just over an hour for our seats. They let you in to the bar area a little bit earlier (about 30 minutes in to our wait), so at least they get you well liquored. Their drink specials are creative and impressive - a good sign. The food though? How is the food? Ok. It was....fantastic. My friend and I are both vegetarian, and we had plenty of options to choose from. Definitely the Black Dal. The paratha was great (although not good for scooping up the dal, as the server suggested but we're risk takers). The paneer? Excellent. The spice levels are just right, meaning they are authentic and yet inviting. I can imagine that someone who is afraid of \"the heat\" will still want to try. Lastly - super affordable given the atmosphere (and its trendy hype) and its food! Worth a stop if you're in the area and have a good friend to chat with during the wait.",

We ordered a few dishes to share, Akuri - Spicy scrambled (akuri or bhurji) eggs--an Irani caf\u00e9 staple. Piled up richly on Fire Toast and served with tomatoes grilled on the vine. Sauage Naan Roll - a Britisher Cumberland sausage, placed in the midst of fresh hot naan with chill tomato jam, cream cheese and herbs and a Bombay Omelette - a crazy-paving omelette of chopped tomato, onion, coriander and green chilli. Served with tomatoes grilled on the vine and Fire Toast. which were all served with a lovely tomato and chilli based dip and also tried the Green Darjeeling Tea and the House Chai which was perfect for a cold Winter's day, full of balanced spices and a nice hit of ginger.All the dishes we had were very good, just the right amount of chilli heat in the Akuri and Bombay Omelette and complimented by the Fire Toast, which is 'toasted' on the grill to give it a nice smoky flavour. The Naan for the Sausage Naan Roll was fresh, crisp and light and would probably be a great hangover cure.",

    "text": "Okay, whether you are a local or just visiting this place is an absolute MUST if you like Indian food. There are places that have great food but so-so ambiance. Or the service is outstanding but location isn't that great. This place has it all. Including collapsible high chairs (the type that just hook onto the table - why don't more places have these?) and, get this, etch-a-sketch boards for the kiddos! How fricken cool is that?The restaurant is enormous. Two stories and a beautiful, peaceful looking patio out front. Dark wood and d\u00e9cor give a warm vibe to the place. And located in Shortditch, it's set in a cool neighborhood with lots of cool, funky shops. Plus, it's reasonable prices for excellent fare with wonderful service. Doesn't get much better than that.Now for the food and drink. The Chai tea drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic options) were so tasty and perfect for a cold day. We enjoyed the most amazing Okra Fries, Mahi Tikka, Sheekh Kabab Lamb, and House Black Daal with naan. If you don't order anything else, the fries and the daal are a must. My husband usually doesn't care for daal and he was scooping every last morsel up in this dish!So Mahi in Bombay can be any kind of fish. This one happens to be a basa fillet and it is cooked to buttery perfection. The lamb, with the lime and spices was straight up delicious.The bonus to the menu is that it's all tapas style. I'm all about small dishes so you can try a number of things. So for our party of 6 adults, it worked out well to just have each couple order dishes to share rather than trying to find a few things for the whole table. I'm a little sad that I live across the pond from this incredible place but I will definitely be back the next time we visit!",

Our waiter immediately got us started with drinks, but when more joined our table, he took their drink orders, but never delivered. I guess that's why you should write orders down :). Then we were left to wait around 50 minutes before he even got around to our food order. It didn't appear the place was short of staff, but efficiency was just not there. Perhaps we were unlucky.So after over an hour, our food started to arrive. Portions for starters were small. Never have I seen samosas so small and only 3 to a plate for around \u00a35. This place is pricey. But then things took a turn for the better. Extremely nice mains easily sharable for 6 people. The rotis are great with pretty much any dish. The gunpowder potatoes were sublime whilst the black dahl is perhaps a smidge overrated. Get the Chai tea and try some of the stranger desserts. The Pineapple and black pepper crumble was interesting. So if you have time to burn and a little cavalier when it comes to value for money, this place is an impressive modern indian fusion restaurant, particularly when it comes to the stranger choices on the menu. Better service would probably help this to 4 stars if I ever make it back.Note: I was at the Shoreditch branch which was not particularly busy at the time on a weekday.",

Also, the pau bun thing was super yummy - it's a veggie potato mash served with the softest brioche type bun. The shrimp starter was perfectly spiced and we were popping them like popcorn. The raita was fine, not the best. \u00a0The naan and roti were warm, soft and fresh. We love to try the drinks. So good. I cannot remember the names, but my favorite is a spicy, sour & sweet cocktail. Try the pineapple desert - and order it with a scoop of ice cream. So good. \u00a0Finally, we love the space.

We selected about 9 things between 4 of us, including their signature 'Black Daal' (divine) and an array of grills, and paneer dishes. The flavours were excellent and the meat succulent. The only thing I love more than a great meal, is several great meals in one. We arrived early as you can't book and got a table no problem, but just 20 minutes later (7pm) there was a queue forming and this was a Tuesday night! The street food style of this place makes it different from the standard curry houses, and the waiting staff were excellent and super friendly. They also brought us some amazing passion fruit martini shots as it was my boyfriends birthday, and a free desert! When can I come back?",

Like many people in London Ive heard about Dishoom over and over and over it was going to make my ears bleed.The wait wasn't crazy, we waited about an hour and a half for a table, and this lovely little chica came along with some sherry for while i was waiting in the queue, in the little chai cups reminiscent of my time in India. Not only this but I had a cocktail that really brought me back, using a reduction of thumbs up! I was so impressed i raved at the bartender about it for 20 mins and that made the time go fast. I really tasted the thunder in that beautifully put together drink.Finally the atmosphere was electric and the d\u00e9cor was perfectly in tune with the Parsi Cafe vibe that Dishoom tried to set, now i was worried about food, living in Mumbai for 4 years of my life, meant i had tried some of the best and most authentic Parsi delights the world has to offer, but Dishoom played it off in style, i loved the beautiful simplicity of the dishes while really hitting home those flavours, everything was delicious and the service just as expected. Definitely will be visiting again!Peace & Love",

I spent two amazing nights there recently, one of which was NYE and included new friends, mouth watering food, incredible cocktails, and dancing to The Beatles on a dance floor off the kitchen downstairs until the wee hours of the morning. Rob. Boon. And a few other folks there really made Dishoom unforgettable. Can't wait to go back. Even if Boon is on hiatus, as long as they have that garlic cheese naan, it is worth the flight over from LA. All the rest: beautiful space,tasty authentic Indian food, a fun and eclectic drink menu... \u00a0is simply a bonus.",

Got there and was told the wait for 2 people would be 1hr+, but my coworker said they're usually faster than the estimate so we went inside and got drinks. While we were in line to check in, a waitress came by holding free samples of sherry, chai, and champagne - how delightful! By the time we got a spot at the bar and ordered/received our drinks, we were called to our table. We got a chance to through the menu while we were waiting at the bar so we knew what we wanted to order when we got seated. This has to be the favorite place I ate at during my short trip in London. We ordered a variety of things: the lamb chops (my fave!), chicken curry, garlic naan, corn on the cob, a salad, and some other vegetable dish. \u00a0Our waitress was great - she was super friendly and gave us recommendations. Everything was delicious! I would definitely come back to try other menu items. They also have free wifi (for those traveling with no cell service like me).",

This place would surely be 5 stars if they instituted a booking process. Waiting for an hour or more in the (a more than 50% chance of) rain is not the best way to start out a dinner. But the fact that we muddled through this uncomfortable process and still managed to enjoy our meals is probably testament to how great the atmosphere and food inside actually are. As other reviewers have mentioned, Dishoom is modeled off of Irani caf\u00e9s that sprouted in Bombay in the early 1900s. Trying to emulate that upper-class convivial caf\u00e9 culture while offering exotic twists on high-end cocktails, Dishoom has hit the nail on the head for Indian Chic. Everything is good. The garlic naan is luscious. The curries are outstanding. Don't forget the dals or chickpea dishes. Sublime! They service breakfast as well. The vibe here is \"come in and hang out.\" If you can get in the door, that is.",

The downstairs space seems to be a little more romantic.We started with an appetizer of vegetable samosas, which were perfectly cooked and served with 3 different chutneys. After that we shared the sheekh lamb kebabs, biryani rice and naan. Everything was great! only complaint was that the lamb kebabs were a little dry but the flavor was excellent.

The restaurant offers indoor and outdoor verandah style seating, which makes you feel as if you are eating dinner in the family room of a house. Low coffee like tables, sofas and a fireplace set the mood. We decided to try and share a variety of plates and some drinks to make sure we experienced as many of the menu offerings as possible. For drinks we went with the Kingfisher beer, typical Indian beer, which was light and refreshing. We paired the beer with the Dishoom Calamari to snack on. The calamari deserves a shoutout as it was not only crunchy but the Dishoom drizzle really made it spectacular with its not too potent garlicky and sweet taste. As the main entrees we shared garlic naan bread, basmati rice, the Dishoom Chicken Tikka, Lamb Boti Kabab, House Black Daal and the Chicken Ruby (chicken curry). Everything was uniquely spicy and flavorful. The lamb was tender, the chicken curry sauce creamy, the Chicken Tikka well marinated in ginger juice and the lentils went perfectly over the rice.To finish off our meal we shared the Dishoom chocolate pudding, which was reminiscent of a molten lava cake and some liquor infused chai - naughty chocolate chai and bailey's chai. Dishoom definitely set the bar high for Indian food and I hope I can find similar places back home. Otherwise, I'm back to London for some more Dishoom!",

Some of my favorites lamb chops, Ruby chicken, okra fries, prawns koliwada.

    "text": "I've been to Dishoom both times I've visited London, and I can safely say that it's best Indian food I've ever had. No hyperbole in that statement - really and truly I've never had anything that comes close to their dishes.The experience began with a worthwhile 1-hour (if not longer) wait, and at this particular location, their staff served chai and sherry for the guests waiting in line. That type of hospitality translated its way into every aspect of the dining. Before you're seated, you'll probably order a drink, and I highly recommend the Colaba Colada - pineapple and coconut-cream classic with a Bombay twist: a little coriander, chai syrup, lime juice and dark rum. When we were seated after just under an hour, we dove head first into the menu and ordered an array of items:-Dishoom calamari: a take on classic calamari, perfectly crispy with some delicious Indian spices-Dishoom chicken tikka: their version of tikka masala but in a spicy marinade as opposed to a thick sauce; perfectly hot and packed with flavor-Sheekh kabab: spicy lamb kebabs that were out of this world, especially with their raita.-House black daal: paired really well with the basmati rice and the plain naanWhen I tell you that every single item I had was perfect, I'm not exaggerating. I wish they came across the pond to Boston because it's going to be an expensive commute for me to fly to London when I'm craving authentic, unparalleled Indian food.",

No problem, went to the bar and got their namesake IPA. Pretty good beer, as expected. The bartenders are friendly and cute, gave me some good recommendation for drinks and where to go. Before I knew it, my table was ready. I got fried okra, chicken ruby, basmati rice and garlic naan. Everything was fantastic. Everything. I had too much food so I shared my okra with my neighbors and made friends :) Dishoom is awesome, now go line up!",

I'd heard how good it was, but I'd never been.The atmosphere is meant to invoke the feeling of being in a Bombay caf\u00e9 from the 60s. And they've got it spot on. You have to get to Dishoom early if you want any chance of getting seated relatively soon after you arrive. We waited about 15 minutes before we got a table. We arrived around 1pm. The server suggested having a chai, which was the most delicious chai I've ever had. It's also bottomless, which is great. After my friend and I perused the menu, we decided on the lamb biryani, black dhaal, chicken tikka, some rice, and garlic naan. It was all SO delicious! The food is family-style, so it's easy to get a bunch of dishes to try with someone else!If you're in London, Dishoom is worth a visit, even if the queue is really long!",

We ordered a feast the first night it was hard to recall all of it but we had a few rice dishes, a curry, cheesy bread, naan, fried okra, corn....to start. Those were all spot on! The star was this slow cooked lamb shank with this yogurt sauce that the waiter insisted we try. Hands down the best lamb I've had. Paired it with their in house beer and it just blew our minds. Breakfast was equally as impressive. There's just too much to recommend - come and you won't be disappointed.",

Wasn't wow'd by this dish at all- Keema per Eedu - this is actually a super savory dish, but the pieces of chicken liver were a bit large and dominating for my taste. If you love chicken liver this is the dish for you.I'm not going to talk too much in detail about dinner because almost everything we ordered was delicious like:- House Black Daal- Lamb chops- Garlic naan- Chicken ruby (any curry really)",

My husband looked at me like I was clinically insane when I said we would wait. But we did wait and it did take about 2 hours to get sat down at a table. I tried to order a little too much because we were so hungry at that point, and the waitress reined me back in. When we finally got that food, the wait was all worth it. Best Indian EVER. We got chicken ruby, tikka paneer, and lamb raan bun with naans and rice and holy moly we raved about it the entire trip. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. Wait for it, it's worth it.",

The sauce of the chicken ruby: perfection. The garlic naan: perfection. The biryanis were tasty, and all of their curries are prepared so well. The restaurant decor is consistent across locations, and offers a nice, upscale but not too in-your-face as it could be so you still feel normal wearing totally casual clothes.",

There are two areas to sit in and I chose to sit in the garden (it was heated even in the winter). The atmosphere is really comfortable and service is friendly and fast. When you go, you must get the cheese toast! It is kind of indescribable but slightly spicy and incredible.

I'd say 3.5Went on Saturday night despite the suicide-inducing 110 minutes of estimated waiting time, and spent the majority of it nibbling on some fabulously juicy prawns, some calamari and lamb samosas (all three very good) and a shitload of alcohol, because how else are you going to deal with life. When we were finally seated, our waitress was knowledgeable - which to me is always a plus, cause my knowledge of Indian food is relative- and ended up ordering half the menu, including their special lamb shank ( Lamb Raan) and a boatload of cheese naan and yogurt and chicken and veggies and, yeah. I had to tell my trainer I was significantly over my macros for the evening and he was not a happy bunny. Now, as a proper food snob, I'll say this: this place has some fantastic pieces: best of the night was the naan and the chocolate and salt mousse, but the rest was \"just good\". I mean, the lamb raan was a tad salty, and we got a veggie concoction called Pau Baji which was really not great. The chicken was good, but I dont need to be going out to a restaurant to have \"just good\"Will I go back? Potentially, also cause there's a hotel bar nearby that had the HOTTEST single guys I've ever seen all in one place in London, so there you go.",

The waiter will give you the full story, which is cool, but we were hungry.

I'm not sure what they're pumping into the restaurant but in concert with the ceiling fans, it did have the right atmosphereFortunately, our party only consisted of 9 people as they wouldn't allow Katie to book for more than 9. For the record, the restaurant wasn't busy, which brings me to one of the bugbears about our visit. The service was slow. Despite there being lots of servers and them walking past our table continuously, it was hard to get anyone's attentionThe best thing I tasted was my rose and cardamom lassi. A unique combination for me and it was deliciousMy bacon naan was nice but in my book, it doesn't really deserve its spot on Time Out's best 100 dishes in London last year. The akuri I ordered was at least Indian in that the scrambled egg was spicyA most pleasant way to have brunch with fun Yelpers but only 3 stars for the food and service",

The wait gets a bit crazy if you're showing up at prime dinner hours (waited two hours Saturday night starting 8:30P), but the food and cocktails make up for it once you're finally seated. For three people we ordered: far far, lamb samosas, pau bhaji, bhel, chicken ruby, vegetable biryani, a lamb dish, black house daal with three garlic naan, and a couple desserts. I'm still stuffed!",

    "text": "Came here for breakfast with a group of Yelpers. The other half and I were the first to arrive at about 10:45. We sit there looking at the menu. The place is fairly empty. Ten minutes go by. I start staring at the servers (as there are TONS of them) to get someone's attention. I do. She says hello. She walks away. FINALLY one says, \"Has anyone been by to take your order?\" UH, bad start. We order water and two Bloody Marys. They took about twenty minutes. People who arrived at our table after us got drinks before us. Granted they weren't ordering booze, but in no way does it take twenty minutes to make two Bloody Marys. The server claimed that \"they take awhile to make\" but in reality she never really put the order in. They came eventually and were actually quite tasty.The food was also very tasty. We ordered a bacon naan roll, sausage naan roll, egg naan roll, some spicy eggs on toast and a toasted bun to dip in Chai. The chili tomato jam that goes with the naan rolls (although they were just folded in half, not a roll) was pretty spectacular. The eggs on toast and bun were great too. It's just the service. It was so terrible. I'd understand if there was only one server, but there were tons of servers and it was so difficult to get ours to come by. We had to flag her down on multiple occasions to order something because we were ignored. The other half almost had to get his own water because it felt like the water wasn't going to come after we asked for it. I get that we were a large table, but we weren't really demanding, so why ignore us?Also, I'm not sure why they don't serve their whole menu all day. The breakfast was good, but it would have been nice to supplement it with some of the regular menu (which also looked great).Not sure we'll be back until they lose the laid back Shoreditch attitude. I want servers who actually want to work and not just stand around being hipsters.",

The portion size was slightly on the small side for brunch so if you're really hungry its probably a good idea to order some extras. Really liked the feel of the place- bright and airy with great decor. Although we sat inside- the front veranda was probably the most impressive part of the building. Service was a little haphazard with our drinks arriving one at a time (there were three of us) and well after our food. Also, this is probably the only Indian restaurant I have ever been to that caters for nut allergy sufferers- usually I avoid Indian restaurants completely as they don't tend to understand the seriousness of nut traces in their food. Will definitely return.",

We were able to do it at the adorable bar and have some killer cocktails while waiting. Dishoom is inspired by old Irani cafes of Bombay. The vibes is unique,. romantic and cozy Even the bathrooms here are have stunning decor. \u00a0For dinner were ordered several dishes to share including black daal, lamb mimosas and lamb chops & chicken tikka. They were all outstanding, but don't miss the tikka! The food was unlike any Indian food i've ever had and so memorable. The service was also on point here. I recommend anyone visiting London to eat here. Even if there is a long wait, it is well worth it!",

I enjoyed the Viceroy Manhattan. Boozy and delicious!My favorite dishes were chicken ruby and black daal. Holy moly. Talk about complex, rich flavor. The daal has a bit of creaminess (it's vegan so I don't what they put in here!) that I've never tasted in a daal and that I was so here for. The chicken ruby is just beyond words. Also good were the lamb mimosas, lamb chops, the puffed poori with chickpea curry, cheese bread and the roti.The lamb raan bun (basically a lamb sandwich) \u00a0and the chicken tikka rolls were fine but underwhelming compared to the others that hit the spot. \u00a0I'll come here (at least once!) every time I'm in London.",

Last time I was in town, I waited close to an hour and we were starving! But it gave us more of a reason to order everything on the menu. I heard today that they are finally taking reservations, so that's an option! The patio seating out front is amazing. The weather was great today and we were able to snag a table right away (it was 12:15! So we were lucky). We ordered quite a bit of food for two people, but we devoured it. The black daal is a must order! Get some butter naan and garlic naan to go with it. You will not be disappointed. We also ordered the paneer which was nice and spicy.",

    "text": "When I visited London, I obviously wanted to try cuisines that the city was known for. In other words, what kind of food do I eat when in London? You know...ones I can't find in the US? So I made a basic list: English breakfast, Indian food, Fish and Chips.For Indian food, I decided to try Dishoom. I was informed by my friend that anyone who visits London to check out Dishoom. So...I did. I yelped it and was supremely excited to see lots of positive reviews. As such, we headed out to Dishoom in Shoreditch for dinner that night. Reservations are recommended to guarantee a table, otherwise I highly suggest you arrive early. Remember, Shoreditch is where the techies work so there's lots of people in the area. We went at 6pm and we were lucky to snag a table. But around 7-8pm, there was a long queue to get in. Dishoom's reputation definitely lived up to the hype for being a well known establishment.Ambience is quite lovely. The place had a very tavern feel to it; clean and professional. The employees were very nice and friendly. They greeted us formally as we walked in. It was, however, a bit dark but the lighting made it very exciting and appealing. We were seated downstairs which looked like a basement where you house and age wine. It was dope.Our waitress was very kind, attentive and responsive. Most importantly, she was well informed about the menu. She fielded all our questions and made key recommendations. For my drink, I ordered their very own Dishoom IPA. It wasn't too bitter, and actually surprisingly smooth. Lighter than the usual IPA but I liked it.For appetizers were ordered Pau Bhaji, Lamb Samosas, and Dishoom Calamari.OK THE PAU BHAJI was the BEST dish from my entire experience. The waitress recommended this and I was extremely pleased by it. It's a bowl of mashed vegetables with hella butter and they give you homemade buns to eat with. Absolutely tasty and delicious. This is a must order here. Also, it's a Bombay thing, so try it to fully immerse yourself in the Dishoom experience. Lamb Samosas - I'm not a big fan of lamb, but it was very well spiced and delicious. Point is, I enjoyed it despite disliking the taste of lamb.Dishoom Calamari - it was ok. Tasted like any other calamari dish I've had. A tiny bit disappointed here but not big deal.For our main courses, we ordered Murgh Malai, Dishoom Chicken Tikka, Masala Prawns, House Black Daal, and Chicken Berry Britannia. Murgh Malai - It was cooked very properly, but wasn't flavorful. It was ok, not bad.Dishoom Chicken Tikka - A bit disappointed because I had better Chicken Tikka, but still good. Not amazingly good.Masala Prawns - Grilled well, tasted good, needs a bit more seasoning. House Black Daal - Dishooms signature dish. Very well made and unique consistency in terms of texture. I liked it very much. My 2nd favorite dish next to the Pau Bhaji. Must order.Chicken Berry Britannia - Had well chosen mix of spices but I was disappointed because it was drier than what I was used to. Spices were well played though. Would I come back? Absolutely! I would also recommend this place to anyone visiting London. They have to stop by and check it out.",

    "text": "It would have been easy to let the two hour line on a Saturday night or the ridiculous phone reservation system that kept me on hold for 10 minutes deter me, but I'm glad I didn't. (To be fair I DID see them bring out platters of drinks to the people in that two hour line.) When I got a reservation for lunch on a weekday, I informed the family, \"We're going to Dishoom now! Chop chop!.\" We sat outside on the charming verandah that gives the illusion that you are sitting inside. (Another interesting decor element are the Crapper brand pull-above-you-to-flush toilets in the bathrooms.)The samosas were excellent. I loved the addition of cinnamon and clove. Unlike some samosas elsewhere, these were wrapped in filo. The chana salad included pomegranate seeds, golden raisins, and chickpeas, and reminded us of jhalmuri.The black dal is advertised on the menu as dal for people who don't like dal. I think that's because it's in a makhani-like sauce. We were told we needed it as a sauce for grilled items. After trying it that way I disagree that it's a necessity. I've had tikka lots of times without a sauce. The chicken tikka was very flavorful, clearly marinated for some time and nicely spiced. The gunpowder potatoes were really good and served with yogurt. The naan was fine. I was impressed that the children's menu was not dumbed down to only offer pizza and chicken fingers like at many places.. My kids had basa marinated in yogurt with Bombay potatoes (same potatoes as ours) and kuchumber, along with a choice of juice. They had fresh squeezed o.j.They offered two types of chai - be still my (jittery caffeinated) heart. The regular chai was too spicy and a tad bitter, but I liked the spices. The chocolate chai was really great. I did notice when I got my chai refill that other than the cocoa on the rim of the glass and the whipped cream, it actually tasted a lot like the chocolate chai. Could the cocoa on the rim be masking the spiciness and bitterness? Either way, intriguing...The food was all uniformly good. It was hard to decide on a best item. We decided it was on par with Sakoon (the husband gave the edge to Sakoon), an Indian restaurant in our city of Mountain View, located in Silicon Valley - another area with a large Indian community. So if you like Dishoom, now you know where to go in the Bay Area.",

We missed our original lunch time reservation, but they were able to accommodate us at 2 pm on a Friday. They kindly introduced us to the bar and let us know we could order some drinks while we wait. Soon after we ordered, they had a table available for 2!The service was great. Our waitress was pleasant and attentive. The food was good! There were some sauces that came with our apps, was a fan of the green sauce.What we ordered:Lamb samosas - soo good, prob my fave thing honestly. Crispy and flavorful.Okra fries: delish but gotta be a fan of okra's gooey textureSpicy lamb chops: yummy! Flavorful and tender.Chicken ruby curry: tasty curry!Garlic naan: good because it's naan, but lacking in the garlic flavor departmentTo sum it up, everything was yummy, but not like out of this world delicious. Also, I was so glad we did not smell like food after we left especially since we had to be out and about. Def make a stop if you can. Get the lamb samosas!",

I don't love that you know you're going to be waiting at least an hour for food, but, the food is actually really good.We came here with some friends on a week day evening around 6:30 and waited about an hour. But within 15 minutes we were warm inside and able to buy drinks, and those cold 15 minutes we were offered chai and peppermint tea! So life isn't so hard after all.Anyway, after the wait we were taken to a lovely table and super cozy chairs. I was really excited to sit in the front area! Our server was very attentive and friendly, and the food was delish. We had veggie samosas, lady fingers (fried okra), chilli garlic bread, mattar paneer (veggie curry) jack fruit biryani, paneer tikka and mashed spicy potatoes. Everything was delicious but I was especially blown away by the mattar paneer and the jackfruit biryani. The curry was especially creamy and flavourful, but the biryani was really the star because that jackfruit tasted so meaty and had the best flavour and texture! Yes please I'd definitely get it again.And I'll come again and be happy to wait :)",

Booking in advance is essential!Recently went to Dishoom for a friend's birthday so we were in a relatively large group, so service was a bit slow but I don't think smaller groups will have this problem as other tables were replaced with new customers quite quickly. The food was fantastic and quite while priced. The cocktails on the menu were a bit expensive (London though...), and the chaijito tasted like a regular mojito so maybe go for post-meal drinks in another restaurant/pub in the area. The style of the restaurant is influenced by colonial era India and a portion of the bill is used as donation to feed children in India. Definitely will go back on the future!",

    "text": "Luck was in our favour when we visited Dishoom and we were told it would be just a 15 minute wait and that we could order some drinks at the bar while we waited. Our drinks hadn't even been made by the time we were whisked away to the front section of the restaurant which was more like a cosy living room (complete with Christmas tree) than the rest of the restaurant which was more formal. I was very surprised that we were given two sofas with a coffee style table to sit at for just the two of us as they could easily have fit four people on it.We'd originally planned to get brunch but were too late so instead had to choose from the all day menu instead. The choices are pretty varied but since I couldn't have my original choice of their famous breakfast naan rolls I decided to recreate something similar with chicken tikka and a cheese naan which sadly wasn't anything to write home about.My dining companions's meal arrived fairly quickly but it took far too long for mine to come out after it to the point that her food was starting to get cold from waiting. In fact the service was really poor overall, I had already almost finished my drink by the time my main course came out and the second one I ordered didn't arrive until after I had finished eating.I wasn't going to have pudding but I was very intrigued by the Memsahib's Mess which was basically Dishoom's own version of Eton Mess made even more amazing by the addition of rose syrup.I'm so glad I did as it was divine and made me want to return and give them a second chance given all the many positive things I'd heard about them before going. Maybe I'll check out their new branch in King's Cross instead.",

Everything was delicious. The chai reminded me of my trip to India. However, the mattar paneer was more lukewarm than piping hot. *Tip: DO NOT COME HERE FOR DINNER. Wait time is usually 1-3 hours.

I would suggest looking past the hype and making a reservation for lunch -- as they are less busy then.My husband and I have been eating at Dishoom since they had their first branch at Covent Garden. The Shoreditch branch has a more laid back vibe.The Far Far is a snack that is reminiscent of the fermented rice crackers you get in India. The Black Dhaal is delicious if Dhaal is your thing. The Chicken Berry Britannia is a biryani topped with cranberries that give it a tangy edge. If you like Paneer, do try the Paneer Tikka. If you just want a snack, try the Bhel. If you want silky, soft, roti then get the Roomali Roti. If you can't decide, the Chicken Ruby is a fool proof choice. You might be tempted to lick the bowl. The staff won't notice. #JustSayingThe Chai reminds me of the street Chai you get in India. It tastes the same!If you have food allergies, ask for the allergy menu where they have marked the possible dishes that you can eat accordingly.",

The okra fingers were nice and crispy, the pau bhaji was one of my favorite dishes, it was full of flavour. The paneer tikkam gunpowder potatos, and chicken ruby were also super delicious. The least popular at the table was the masala prawns... but I think thats because we were all pretty full by the time they came out! The side of kachumber, rice, and garlic naan all perfectly complimented the dishes.I highly recommend this place with a group so that you can order more dishes and taste them all!

I must say the wait is pretty long so if you can go during off hours that would save time if you are on a schedule. As we were waiting we were able to order appetizers at the bar which helped with the wait. This place was one of my favorite eats during the trip. We had the bhel which was a little different but good, chole frankie which i thought was tasty, mutter paneer was good, chicken tikka was okay not my favorite as i have had better, and paneer tikka i believe which was good. The waiter thought that we needed one more dish but we said we wanted to start with this and if we need additional food we will order later. The waiter was great and helpful too. He tried to assist with providing suggestions. Overall a great place and you can tell since people are willing to wait to eat there.",

    "text": "Of all the Dishoom locations in London, this Shoreditch mainstay was my first and remains my favorite of the bunch. The Indo-Persian joint has great food and cocktails, at fair London prices, but what puts it over the top is the outtasight decor. You'll feel just like you've stepped into some kinda film noir Bollywood set circa mid-1900's. If it's a sunny day in London, and you're lucky enough to grab a seat on the coveted veranda, all the better. The okra fries are a delicious staple, and the black Dahl and lamb bothi kebabs have never disappointed. Dishoom also does breakfast and the naan-based egg sandwiches are out of this world, even the simple yogurt and granola is done with a spectacular Indian twist and sublime attention to detail. Only downside to this joint, is sometimes you'll have to wait in a line, as it's popular. The good news? They'll bring you refreshments whilst waiting, and usually you can hang at the bar, have drinks and snack on ones fries and the lot.",

    "text": "I have eaten here twice for breakfast and once for dinner. Once, I got the Akuri eggs, which were super tasty with just the right amount of spice (not too spicy, not too salty), served with a side of grilled tomato and two little buttered buns (~\u00a37, 4 stars--5 if it had been a little warmer, as it was a bit cold upon being served). The house chai I got with another buttered bun was also quite good--I mean, the chai was excellent (5 stars), though the bun itself was just another buttered bun, and like some other reviewers have said, it wasn't my favorite thing to dip into the chai. Maybe it would be better if the bun had a sprinkling of sugar and cinnamon? Either way, you can get a chai for \u00a32.50 or a chai with a bun for \u00a32.70, so no harm there. Plus, the chai is limitless--which, if you have an attentive server, may be filled without you even asking, but if you get an inattentive one, may never be filled even if you ask three times (both situations happened to me). Either way, for under \u00a310 for a meal in a sit down restaurant (whose ambiance is chic via a distressed style of decor layered with a bit of humor in the signage), it's not too bad, even if the portion on the eggs leaves you a bit unfulfilled (even if you steal some breakfast lassi from your friend--which tastes more like banana than anything else (2.5 stars)).The second breakfast I had there was the Bombay omelette. I had just had an apple, carrot and ginger juice (~\u00a34, 4.5 stars), so maybe the ginger took away my sense of taste, but I found this omelette to be not only overcooked and therefore dry but quite flavorless save for two bites that had a piece of hot pepper in them (~\u00a37, 1 stars). This dish came with one grilled tomato and \"fire toast\", which is really just thick cut white bread toasted on the grill, which leaves blackened stripes on it, and buttered--3 stars. Along with this dish, I tried some of my co-eater's bacon and egg naan. I will say that, aside from the Akuri I had gotten previously, this was stellar--5 stars for sure. I mean, I don't eat a lot of bacon, as the fat kinda grosses me out, but if you look away while biting into this, you'll taste so many different flavors all at once--the smokiness of the bacon, the sweetness of the chili, the creaminess of the cream cheese, the spice of the chili... It's absolutely wonderful, though for \u00a36.50, realize you get a rather small serving and probably need to order something else if you want a heartier breakfast. (Same portion warning goes with pretty much anything other than the Big Bombay, unless you are the type that typically stays full from a couple of eggs and pieces of bread.) I also tried his Kejriwal (\u00a34.90), which was two eggs served on a piece of toast with a bit of chili and cheese. I thought my bite of this was rather interesting. It had a nice bite to it from both the chili and the (sharp cheddar?) cheese--4 stars.When I went for dinner we started with a couple of drinks and the pau bhaji (\u00a33.90 for a tapas-like serving). It had a quite nice flavor, says this American, but could have benefited from a bit more veggies in the sauce and at least one more bun for dipping (3.5 stars). My Indian co-eater that night said it also needed more peas in order to be more authentic. As for the mango (and fennel) lassi I was drinking at the time, it was quite sour and was therefore nothing like a lassi I have ever had except one made by my friend once--using a mango that was not ready to be cut in fat-free plain \u00a0yogurt. I'm not sure how Dishoom makes their lassis, but at about \u00a34 a glass (not bottomless!), they are not what I would expect--which is sweet and addictive. My Indian co-eater agreed. The bowl of black daal we split over a serving of basmati rice was presumed to be the star, but honestly was pretty blah. I found it smoky, if not a bit burnt, rather than rich and decadent like this buttery lentil dish normally has been for me. Plus, the smoky hid the Indian spice that I love so much. For a girl who dislikes bbq, this was an unhappy choice in spicing (~\u00a35, 2 stars). Given this dish was not the star, there was now an opening--which was filled by our dessert: Memsahib's Mess (\u00a35.20). This dessert was a bit on the small side for its price, but was BIG on flavor. From the super sweetness of the crunchy meringue to the creamy cream to the superb rose undertones, it was absolutely wonderful. Not overly rich, but sweet enough and exotic enough to really stand out--5 stars. Bottom line: I think there are some dishes that are excellent and some that are okay and some that are plain poor, and though this ambiance is excellent and prices are in line with the rest of London, the servings of certain items could be improved. Combined with inconsistently good (or poor) service, I think 3 stars is really the perfect description of this place. I would recommend trying it, but giving feedback to your waiter if you are not happy so you can order something else then and there...",

The surprise had to do with the creative menu, offering sandwich-like options but with an unusual mix of flavors and ingredients. There were only 2 of us so our ability to sample the menu was limited, but our entrees -- a chick pea salad with nuts, grains, pomegranate, and more, and a grilled chicken 'wrap' along with a shared bowl of the recommended Dahl -- were fabulous. Service was friendly and very responsive. As others have mentioned, this restaurant is very popular. We arrived near the end of the lunch hour (1:30), to a busy restaurant, but were seated quickly.",

    "text": "Dishoom, literally a stones' throw away from my office in Shoreditch, had long since been a haunt of ours for after work drinks. Somehow over the last year or so, our post-office sessions had taken us to a pub down the road, but I think that had more to do with the arrival of new faces, replacing our favourites who went on to open the new Kings Cross site or moved on to new adventures. That said, the guys are still friendly and all is well, but there is just something that is always welcoming about people recognising you, knowing your tipple of choice, having a bit of banter and showing their appreciation for your interest in their passion for making cocktails.Recently, I re-kindled my affair with Dishoom, not just once, but twice in a 5 day period. A catch up with an old friend brought us here for dinner and we were not disappointed. Now, we had wanted a quiet one, so debated going here because it can be quite loud with the music and people packing out the bar. My recommendation is that you do not let this put you off, as the terrace area provides the calm if you are not up for the chaos.This was to be a night of feasts, so we ordered a selection of small plates including chilli cheese toast (cheddar), okra fries (fried, well-seasoned and a great snack) and calamari (tiny tender calamari, but no skimping on the portion size). For my main, it was Masala prawns, served slightly charred with a side of lime. Meaty and tasty. I also had some cheesy nan on the side. Valentina had the Lamb Raan bun which is slow cooked pulled lamb on sourdough bread with a side of Dishoom slaw, sali crisp chips and fried green chillies. The lamb was so delicate, so there is no doubt that this is produced slowly. The combination of all these bits piled individually on the wooden serving board, complement each other so well. Be wary of the green chillies, they are spicy! My overall advice would be to also take a raita if you are opting for non-sauce based dishes, otherwise it will be quite a dry meal. For drinks, we started with a refreshing prosecco, followed by a Sicilian white for me (Parva res Catarratto) and a full bodied red from Puglia for Valentina who is Sicilian (Terre di Montelusa Primitivo). Complimentary water is provided which is a great touch.Dishoom has four sites now, in great locations. What I like is that each has their own specials, this helps retain individuality. There is no chance that this will become some boring chain as the food has bags of personality, the concept is sexy and it has what all restaurateurs covet, a team of good solid folk working there.",

    "text": "All chai is coming strictly without Opium, but you would think otherwise with how good the Indian food is here at Dishoom. \u00a0Easily my favorite Indian restaurant in the United Kingdom, Dishoom draws inspiration from Bombay and all its incredible spices and flavors. \u00a0There are multiple locations, each with its own uniqueness, but if you're looking for some of the most flavorful bites you'll ever take, Dishoom is the place to go.I believe it is important to eat family-style, each person ordering a couple of dishes and sharing them. \u00a0Get the Lamb Raan Bun and the House Special Pau Bhaji, the former a succulent pulled lamb with spices and special slaw, and the latter a masterpiece of mashed veggies and a pau bun.In terms of grilled meats and curry, the Dishoom Chicken Tikka is never a bad choice, but I would also consider the Mahi Tikka or the Murgh Malai, both excellently prepared dishes. \u00a0If you're into Biryani, I would say to choose between the Chicken Berry Britannia and the Awadhi Lamb, both dependant on whether the choices on mains include chicken or lamb.Finally, the Breads. \u00a0Basmati rice is a given to get for your meal, but the right bread choice will help shape the experience of the meal. \u00a0The Roomali Roti is an unleaved stoneground wholemeal, griddled and quite thin, in comparison to the leavened and yeasty, tandoor cooked Naan breads. \u00a0Each have distinct tastes, if you're not familiar with Indian breads, but I tend to lean towards the Garlic Naan.Final word of advice, don't leave without getting the Bombay Pimm's, it is quite possibly the best cocktail on the drink menu, and if you're not careful, you may end up ordering 4 or 5 before it's too late.Eccentric vibes and atmosphere, and an awesome enclosed patio space makes this place a top rated restaurant. \u00a0Add the fact that each dish is appropriately priced, and the case is there for why Dishoom deserves 5 stars.",

Their traditional beer is outstanding, we skipped appetizers and ordered; the dhal which was above average, ruby chicken which was the best Indian item and their special tikka which is perfect after you squeeze some lemon over it. Food comes spiced decently (for someone who likes very spicy it's quite something) and with three sauces. Finally the pistachio kulfi was quite something coming in a stick version. Overall great experience, portions are decent and so would advise special care when ordering so as not to over-order. I would skip the dhal as its slightly above average and take something else. Beware you ll come out smelling like curry.",

I am not an Indian food expert but everything we had was pretty damn good. My favorites were the shrimp, and the lentils. We took a while to decide but the food came out quickly and in rapid waves. The food was gone almost as fast. Well worth a visit.",

Once again the food impressed me. We all had the sausage & egg naan roll and shared the yogurt & granola. \u00a0Each were absolutely delicious! \u00a0Unfortunately they were out of chai when we ordered (really??!) but if you're lucky enough to order you do get unlimited refills. This is the same chai they graciously serve down the line while you stand for an hour (rain or shine) waiting for your table!*I've been for dinner several times - and at both locations - and each visit has been a great experience. \u00a0No matter who I take with me, they enjoy it too. \u00a0The staff are adept at helping to construct a table menu that is well balanced; just point out what you have your heart set on and they'll recommend other dishes to complete the meal. \u00a0I particularly love the grilled paneer skewers.*There is always a bit of a wait, so I recommend going during the week to avoid the worst of it. You can wait in the bar on weekend mornings when you simply have to endure the crowd to enjoy the brunch, since they stop serving at noon.",

    "text": "Oh, Dishoom in Shoreditch. I rarely give 5-stars but this deserves it.Being a fan of Indian food and living in London has been quite the success for me food-wise. What else do you need other than the regular chicken tikka massala with pilau rice and some hot naan? London is crammed with Indian restaurants of all kind so when I first went to Dishoom, I didn't expect much.First of all, this branch of the Bombay restaurant is in Shoreditch, a really cool neighborhood with markets, small caf\u00e9s, boutiques and street art. The interior is inviting, it has a vintage and ethnic vibe fused with modern chic, and the verandah is to die for.Even though they take reservations, they reserve half their tables for walk-ins, and although you might have to wait on a packed Saturday night, you are guaranteed a spot, which is rare in London have you not booked in advance.The staff was very helpful, giving recommendations on portions and flavours, what goes with what, etc. We were three and ended up getting exactly as much as we could eat, which was marvelous. The potatoes were outstanding, as were the curries. The chicken tikka was not as good as expected, but was still fine.What I liked most is that although this place serves authentic Indian food, it fuses its tastes with other Asian cuisines and creates perfection. The prices are pretty good as well. Overall, bringing each and every one of my friends to Dishoom:)",

    "text": "DELICIOUS and worth the wait! Came here on a Sunday night around 7PM and waited about 1.5 hrs for a 2 person table inside. The wait isn't so bad - they bring out tasty cups of hot chai and sherry wine to everyone standing in line, then once you reach the front of the restaurant they give you a buzzer and let you order drinks and snacks at the bar until your table is ready. There is a very cute patio with seating, but it seemed like you needed to specify if you wanted to sit out there and/or wait even longer for those tables.For 2 people we ordered 4 dishes with garlic naan and everything was better than any Indian food I've eaten before, although they are not the dishes you'd expect to see at a more casual Indian food place (they're better). 4 dishes with naan (and no rice) was more than enough food for 2 people. The Keema Pau was really tasty - spicy minced lamb with peas and onions that you eat with soft buttery dinner rolls. Then we had the Chicken Ruby Curry - I liked this better than my old standby favorite, Butter Chicken. The curry had a lot of spices in it and they all worked great together. The House Black Daal was my favorite thing that we ordered. It came in a delicious creamy tomato-y sauce. We also had the bowl of greens to get some vegetables in, which was good and interestingly flavored. We had a Bhang Lassi (non-alcoholic) for dessert. This was amazing! The yogurt drink was thinner than I've had at other places, which I preferred, and it came with candied fennel - the whole thing tasted like a candy milkshake (but not too sweet) and was delicious.The service was great and fast, and I especially loved the decor and the way that the menu explained what the restaurant is all about and how they're trying to recreate the feeling of an old Bombay Cafe in London. It's great to eat at a place that not only serves amazing food but also puts a lot of effort into giving the place a great overall aura and awareness of the culture and history of the place you're eating in. Highly recommend, don't let the wait discourage you!",

We put our names down and were told that it would be about 60-70 minutes but you can wait by the bar to get a drink. There are a few standing tables by the bar if you can snag one. We probably only waited 35-40 minutes so at least it was overestimated. The food is delicious. You really can't go wrong with anything you get.",

    "text": "London's love for Dishoom runs deep. Apparent from the growing list of accolades that the restaurant has accrued, ranging from customer reviews to the platitudes of food bloggers and critics alike. While the playful yet meticulous d\u00e9cor, the obliging staff and the complimentary 'Chai-Fi' all play a part in generating such a loyal following, the food is ultimately the lynchpin of Dishoom's success. Vibrant, experimental, filling and affordable- it's a rare fusion of these factors. Few restaurants in the capital have such highly recognisable dishes- they are so photogenic that they reappear on foodie Instagram feeds and are retweeted by your brunching acquaintances on Twitter. While it's not a quiet success, there's no shame in fighting for a table at Dishoom. The atmosphere is spirited, service is timely and the food is fun and satisfying. Why would you travel further afield for a potentially lacklustre pop-up? I made my inaugural visit to the Shoreditch location for a Sunday brunch in February 2016. Immediately, I was impressed by how large and lively the location was. The front of house staff and the servers were warm and congenial- we were seated in an area with plenty of room and our server was patient as we scrutinised the menu. Options range from healthier fare- including a bottomless porridge- to cooked breakfasts and the widely celebrated (and much photographed) naan rolls. There was no real competition: we succumbed to their reputation and ordered one bacon and one egg naan with masala beans on side, a breakfast lassi, a Virgin Mary and a round of Americanos while we waited.Plenty has been written about Dishoom's naan rolls with earnest reason. And everything you've heard is probably true. Freshly baked naan is pulled from the tandoor oven by an assembly line operation in the open kitchen downstairs, arriving as a springy soft casement- still warm from the oven- for every filling. Amply substantial and a thing of beauty- especially compared to any stodgy white bread variation- this elevates the bacon roll into luxury. The filling is equally laudable: my two eggs oozed with golden yolks, mingled with the hot sweetness of the chili tomato jam, the mild creaminess of soft cheese and the hint of fresh coriander. It arrived with extra tomato chili jam on the side, which I took as an impetus to cast cutlery aside and dig in with my hands (nimble fingers were required to dip small chunks of bread into the small ramekin).The masala beans also triumphed, evading a sugary and gloopy tomato sauce for a robust, mildly heated and fragrant base. They were delicious paired with the naan roll, especially for those who are ravenous (and we were). The breakfast lassi was a thick blend of oats, yogurt, banana and mango, resulting in a rich smoothie. It coats the throat and is a deliciously fruity liquidised meal that completely lacked the syrupiness of a cheap mango puree-based drink.Even the coffee hits the right notes at Dishoom, where Malabar coffee is served, made from Arabica beans 'from a single estate in Sunticoppa, Karnataka, are bared on wood to the monsoon winds' (in their own words). It was full-bodied devoid of any bitterness, making it a strong and easy palatable cup.At under \u00a35.50 for the bacon naan roll (and \u00a34.90 for my two egg roll), Dishoom offers superlative value for a deliciously filling brunch. We left with full bellies, licking our fingers and wondering just why we had waited so long to visit. Maybe we subconsciously knew it would be a floodgate for future Sunday trips- better to start now because we have to start making up for lost time somehow.",

    "text": "My god. What does everyone see in this place? This has got to be some of the worst Indian food I have ever tried.Not 1, not 2, not 3, but ALL 5 of the dishes we ordered were drier than the Sahara desert. So dry that we had to treasure the extremely stingy (half a shot glass) sauces that came with our starters, so dry that we had to ask for extra sauce that never came, so dry that we had to choke the food down.Now I can forgive the dry samosas, or even the salty fried okra, but lamb chops are supposed to be juicy and packed with flavour damn it! Also one lamb chop on my plate was medium while the other 2 were well done, how does that even happen? Half of it was inedible fat anyway.The worst I have to say was the paneer tikka. Paneer is supposed to be drenched in sauce not slightly grilled and slightly seasoned. With plain basmati rice, my friends dish practically tasted like nothing. On the plus side, the atmosphere is cool and buzzy. And the prices aren't crazy expensive. Well.. maybe they are for the quality of food served.",

We came at about 5:00  or maybe a little earlier on a March afternoon and walked right in. Right after that, the line began to form. As Southern Americans we shared our fried okra with an elderly couple from Norway who had never tried okra. That was a sweet memory. And now when I fry Southern fry my okra I use chickpea flour (graham flour) in my batter. When you travel you learn things!",

Waited about 20 mins in the outside queue and was served a couple of free sherries, nice!

    "text": "Yelp, you really effed me over on this one. Dishoom was by far our most disappointing meal of our 10 day U.K. trip. London is known for their top notch Indian food so I was expecting this place to blow me away. Instead, it just made me homesick. I toughed out the 90 min wait because I knew London on a Saturday night would be ridiculously crowded. I hated that we couldn't leave the restaurant while we waited like you often can in the states. They still use the old beeper system, and it took 20 min to get to the hostess stand to get it. We spent the rest of the time in the bar. Service in the bar was awful. The waitress got orders from three other parties around us, but we were ignored. We flagged her down when she returned with their orders quite some time later. We snacked on the pau bhaji which was spicy and unique, like Indian sliders. I got some chai to warm up, and that did the trick.We were seated three different places. First the hostess offered to seat is \"somewhere more quiet\" when a large party took over our area. Apparently, \"somewhere more quiet\" was directly next to the fiery hot kitchen on a high top. No thanks. The third place was just right. I got paneer tikka, and my husband got prawns korma, some of our favorites at home. Dishoom's versions were way more expensive and not nearly as good. My husband's prawns were small and didn't come with the creamy sauce we were expecting. My paneer tikka was just pieces of cheese with a slice of bell pepper in between. That's it. Luckily, we did get the black lentils and garlic naan, and those were standouts. Anyone going to London, please ignore the high star rating of this place and try somewhere else.",

Don't miss the black daal!Beyond the unforgettable daal, the entrees and non-alcoholic drinks were outstanding - really loved the virgin bombay colada. We had the chicken ruby (like a curry) which had a wonderful sauce of which we devoured every last drop. The murgh murai and sheekh kabab (lamb) were outstanding, I'm partial to lamb but this time the chicken beat it.We waited about 45 minutes on a Sunday night after being told the wait was over one hour. We thought that time was a godsend as the Covent Garden location had a 2.5+ wait the night before.",

There was 5 of us and we were able to order a LOT of food which was probably the best way to do it. The okra fingers were so lovely but I think the show stoppers were the daahl and the chicken ruby curry. It was super crowded though and took us a while to get a table, but once we did the food arrived relatively quickly. Honestly, it was so good I'm still dreaming about it.",

The queue for the bar was about 20 minutes and then the queue for a table was about an hour. It was our last night in London and I realllllly wanted some Indian food so we waited. The staff at the front and inside were very friendly. While we were waiting in the bar queue outside a hostess came around w complimentary drinks of sweet sherry wine, chia tea, and lemon water.. she came around every few minutes which was a really nice touch cus you had something to sip on while you waited. Once we were at a table we started ordering to our hearts delight. We got the veggie and lamb samosas, the ruby chicken, some rice, naan, and a few other things that slip my mind. Everything was well worth the wait. The place does not disappoint. Definitely plan on making a trip back here for their brunch.",

Every visit prompts me to order the simple, yet delicious far far, ultra-rich and satisfying black daal and the ever-tasty okra fries topped off with a refreshing East India gimlet.Both locations have a great environment for socialising and sharing plates, and with reasonable prices a visit (or three) is a must!",

Thanks Katie B for organising it!I get it, it's sunday morning and the wait staff just don't want to deal with a massive party. They've probably had really rough nights, but not even a smile? A fake screwed on one? No? okay. The food wasn't great. I loved the flavour of my chai chocolate but, it actually arrived lukewarm. Is that supposed to be a thing? I don't get it.The sausage naan roll was okay, it wasn't stellar and it needed alot of the asian style jam/chutney to make it easier to eat! I just didn't warm up to you Dishoom (pun unintended), it wasn't exciting enough, for an unconventional breakfast.",

There are beautiful flowers along the entry path with picnic benches for enjoying cocktails and food al fresco when we have sunny weather. They now have a fab summer verandah. Amazing cocktails created by the knowledgeable bartenders at the well-designed The Permit Bar; a relaxing environment for drinks// cocktails and catching up with friends in an eye-catching bar. They create a wider variety of drinks and cocktails than the Covent Garden branch, perfectly made to original cocktail recipes but adding their own unique twist, like nimbu pani and the Bombay Martini; plus they will create variations of cocktails on the menu to customers requests without hesitation, like a whisky chai, whereas the Covent Garden branch bartenders were unwilling to go off the bar menu. Fabulous food created by the kitchen team, lead by the pleasant and friendly Head Chef Yash, especially the street food like samosas, fresh and crispy bhel puri and vada pau (the Indian version of a chip butty). Save space for their mango or malai kulfi (which has a lovely addition of caramel) and their melt-in-the-mouth nankhatais. Pleasant and efficient service. Overall, great place for Indian and Asian food, and would recommend in a heartbeat!",

    "text": "My experiences at Dishoom have run the gamut from 3 stars (my first visit) to 5 stars.BRUNCH:Ah, you used to be a 5 star brunch. \u00a0Don't get me wrong, it's still very good, just not quite the excellent value for money that it used to be. \u00a0I should've known when the Ginger Pig bacon naan roll was trialled that prices would be raised (\u00a35.20 now, used to be \u00a33.70). \u00a0It's still worth it, just less so than before. \u00a0I can't honestly remember if they're a little bigger now than they used to be, I think they are but not sure. \u00a0A few other notes - the Akuri (scrambled eggs with spices) are still tasty, but last time I went they were serving normal grilled tomatoes rather than cherry tomatoes. \u00a0It's not the same guys, sort it out. \u00a0I also used to like the Full Bombay breakfast (bacon/sausage/beans/tomato/toast), but it's steep (\u00a311.50). \u00a0I will say that none of these things will stop me coming back, I'm very partial to the place - I really enjoy their Malabar coffee (very low acidity, very dark) and their mango/fennel lassi. \u00a0It's just not quite as wonderous as it used to be, unfortunately. \u00a0Still, if you want something a little bit (admittedly not hugely) different, then this is an excellent choice.MAIN MENU:My experiences of the main menu here have been quite mixed. \u00a0My first trip with a veggie friend was somewhat underwhelming considering how popular the place is - all the dishes we tried were ok, just not especially memorable. \u00a0However, I've been a few times since and there are some total gems on the menu:i) \u00a0Bhel (starter) - I love bhel puri, and this ones a good 'un (it's a mixture of puffed rice with chopped onions and a coriander-based dressing). \u00a0It does sometimes come a liiiiittle bit soft, but the flavouring is good and comes with a nice topping of pomegranate seeds. \u00a0Moreish.ii) \u00a0Chicken & pomegranate salad - this is delicious, a large plate with a generous helping of well spiced chicken, coriander dressing, and pomegranate seeds. Really good balance of flavours and textures, nice and tangy.iii) \u00a0Chicken ruby - so buttery and tangy and delicious. \u00a0Definitely one of my favourite curry dishes I've had of late. \u00a0Nothing with this much butter in it can be bad.The breads are also all very good (as are the accompanying sauces - I particularly like the chilli one). \u00a0A lot of my friends are very fond of the black daal. I like how buttery and thick this one is; at the same time, I find it to be lacking a little something - probably because I like my daal to be loaded with garlic. \u00a0I want it to make me stink. \u00a0This doesn't quite do that. \u00a0It's good, it's just lacking that little something to make it truly moreish.I really like the interiors here; there's also a veranda to sit in which is nice when it's sunny outside. It's \u00a0very spacious too. \u00a0The staff are generally friendly although the service speed is pretty variable. \u00a0It gets pretty busy and things get a bit haphazard. It's surprising given how well established the place is (and should be used to high volumes of people), but it's not usually too much of an issue. \u00a0On the subject of volumes of people...evenings are mad (1+ hour waits sometimes). \u00a0Still, I will keep coming back to this place, for some reason I find it...calming? \u00a0I don't know. There's a lot to like, even with the recent changes.",
