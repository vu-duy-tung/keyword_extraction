    "text": "With a great location on Marylebone High Street, Coco Momo is one of those places that was designed for success: somewhat yuppy decor plus reasonably good food and plenty of drink options. Spent a delightful late afternoon lunch here over the weekend with a friend and found pretty much everything satisfactory. They seated us more quickly than expected, giving the two of us rock-star seating in the corner couch, even though it was probably easier for them to give the group who came in afterwards this prime location. The service was really good, attentive, but not too much so. I had a delicious steak sandwich but my friend was lukewarm about the beetroot risotto. However, all was forgotten after sharing a pretty good bottle of red from their list.",

Last night however the food was what kept this spot from being 4 or 5 stars. The appetizer platter was underwhelming and over priced. However, the wine was delightful and a great deal for a bottle of bubbly. We'll be back for drinks but doubt we'll try the food again.",

But it's nice and cosy inside, a lot of space and very high ceiling. The menu is simple, gastro-pub type food, and nice. Just don't get the rosemary & garlic fries - it's basically normal fries on which they sprinkle rosemary & garlic salt. A bit silly if you ask me.Staff was friendly.So overall, it's a chillaxed place for a quite WE lunch, or drink + newspaper laid back afternoon. Nothing deadly exciting about it, but still I would go back and surely enjoy it.",

There's nothing wonderful about Cafe Momo, it falls down somewhat when it comes to the decor. And given that there are so many waitresses standing about by the bar, we were confused by the fact that it wasn't table service. I don't mind going to the bar (I actually prefer it, I can carry drinks all by myself), but I'd like to be able to get to it. But once you've got them, the drinks are tasty. Their peach sangria is excellent, they've got an interesting choice of beers on. It's not over-priced given the area. It's not the prettiest place on Marylebone High Street, but it's not too shabby at all. If you spot a table outside and it's warm enough for a few hours of drinks and gossips, you might find you lose track of time.",

    "text": "Coco Momo is a great little cafe/bar in the centre of Marylebone. You'll be able to spot it by the hoards of people outside trying to get a table for weekend brunch. These smart locals come to Coco Momo because it is by far one of the cheapest places in the area and the food is really high quality. Last time I was there during the week I noticed that they offer a great lunch deal, either soup and a salad or a salad and a wrap for \u00a36. The portions are substantial and the salads are very creative. My mackerel, brown rice and walnut creation was delicious and not the run of the mill mozzarella and tomato option offered in so many other places. Inside the bar is very pretty with old wooden furniture and comfy sofa's by the corner. Old antique mirrors hang from exposed brick walls and stunning chandeliers light the room up. This spot seems to be a notorious destination for young families so expect to find lots of groups cooing over new-borns and children that are too young to object, dressed as bees and dragons and being passed around for the adults entertainment. If you plan to visit Marylebone for your Christmas shopping I would recommend a stop over in Coco Momo because at the moment they're serving mulled wine and mince pies. What better way is there to cheer yourself up after trawling the shops all morning? Well worth a visit!",

    "text": "Wandering around Mayfair in the sunshine on Saturday afternoon, Coco Momo looked very tempting with it's outdoor seating and tables lined with pimms, champagne and yummy looking salads...So, we wander in and ask if we can get a drink and put our names down for outdoor seating (all the outdoor tables were, unsurprisingly, taken) to which we are told that we must wait outside and grab a table as soon as one frees up. \u00a0Ok, fine. \u00a0We wait in the street, amusing ourselves by trying to guess which table will free up first....an hour later, after three false starts, the skinny lushes at the end table finish their champagne and we grab their seats.We are informed that the kitchen will be closing at 5pm and it is currently 4.50pm, so we ordered an antipasto plate, some chunky chips and 2 cocktails. \u00a0The antipasto cost just under \u00a39 and was enough to share between the two of us (it comprised of salami, chorizo, prosciutto, olives, a little salad, some really tasty buffalo mozarella and bread) it was good quality and the chips were fresh and tasty too.Right after waiting an hour for our table (fair enough, it was our own stupid fault to wait that long...) some women came up and asked if they could take one of our chairs, so of course we let them. \u00a0Little did we realise that what they actually meant was, 'can us four, annoying, loud women come and share your cosy little table for two, and then make lots of noise right in your ear as we show each other the underwear we have just bought from Primark and discuss the various rashes we get all over our bodies from working out at the gym'! \u00a0Sigh.Anyway, the food was good, the drinks were tasty (although pricey - \u00a36 for a glass of pimms, whereby you can get a pint of pimms for \u00a36 at my favourite local pub, The Regent)...There was a big review written by Michael Winner in the window, boasting how great the burgers and 'the freshly squeezed orange juice that was freshly squeezed that morning' were - perhaps he should get some pointers from Yelp...*ahem*.... :)When I went to the bathroom, the toilet was blocked and about to overflow.THEN, as we finished our food and drinks, a different waitress came over and said 'Can you pay?' in an abrupt tone without even asking us if we wanted another drink or anything else - like they wanted to get rid of us. \u00a0Not, 'here's your bill' or 'can I get you anything else', but 'can you pay?' Yes, we can pay, and you missy are not getting a tip.",

By the same token, there comes a time when you realise that you'd like a venue to contribute toward making you feel relaxed and to facilitate conversation. The opposite is true for so, so many of them. This place seemed like the former, then annoyingly became the latter. Even if you have a table, there's something about a standing pool of shrieking harridans or guffawing chinless Caspians that can really take the shine off the evening. So yes, I'm committing the sin of judging a place on its clientele, but if somewhere is consistently filled with the sorts of people that you'd cheerfully throw into a combine harvester then I think that's the sort of info that we, as Qypers, should know. So there you go. It's nice enough, in a low-table / sofa / reasonably tasteful way. As has been said before, it's worth a look if you're passing. Take some earplugs, though, just in case.",

We had to ask twice to see if our food was ready as those who arrived far after us had already gotten their food,eaten and paid by the time we finally got our food! The waitress never came back to check on us so we flagged down another waiter to grab us more water and the bill. When we complained to the manager (politely) she was very snotty and really didn't care to lose our business at all! Word to the wise,go eat at Whole Foods food court that is close by!!!!!",

I usually go for drinks in the evening or at night, but I have been for lunch once and it was satisfying. The atmosphere is perfect for chillin with friends, catching up in a laid-back cutesy environment. The bartenders are always nice and fun to talk to and the drinks/cocktails are delicious! Last time I went I had the Elder gin (Gin with Elderflower liqueur and orange bitters) which was amazing and *strong*. I live really close and this place is pretty much always poppin'. Definitely recommend!",

Appears to be a regular after work venue. Has potential but I really don't get the haphazard old furniture that's a mix between high stools, old cafe chairs and only two large tables with couches. I thought there was an upstairs but the stairs despite being very open doesn't lead to a public area. There is a menu on the wall on a glass pane but as its written white I can't read it even though I'm really close to it. \u00a0Bar area is quite small but there's lots of spirits so worth going for just a couple.",

For a mere 15mn, they just lost a customer. The cook from far away seemed to wonder why the waiter and the manager were so strict on the rule. \u00a0Original review:After passing by many times we ended up trying this place for an English breakfast. We were clearly not disappointed by our choice, which led us to come back again few times, even just for coffee.So for food, our English breakfasts were delicious. One of us also tried the sandwiches which were great. And the other plates we saw passing by looked delicious.We went back simply for a morning coffee also, relaxing on the nice couches they have in a corner.So this place is a great choice for coffee to food for breakfast and lunch, and has a nice cosy atmosphere. The tables are nicely spaced apart so you can enjoy your own conversation or read a book. The whole place is also nicely decorated.As for service: very friendly.",

And Coco Momo rates as highly as any.The open-plan design and wall o' windows that feature in this corner plot bar all add up to a light, airy and spacious place to come for drinks. It can be noisy and clattery in there, so it definitely is not a place to come to chill after a stressful day.The bar staff here are the biggest asset to Coco Momo and it's owners. They do a great job in serving the drinks (amazing cocktails too.. martinis are brilliant here) and are on whole, very friendly and helpful. I feel that this place lacks a larger bar and more staff. You can be subjected to a long wait for a drink at peak times, which really takes the edge off the place.I would really love to rate this place a 4+ Star experience. However, I can't. The torturous bar waits have lost that additional star.",

    "text": "High hopes dashed in the space of about half an hour. Coco Momo, though pleasant in appearance, clean and inviting, only goes downhill after a positive first impression. The problem isn't the staff, they were diligent and helpful, and it wasn't the surroundings, they weren't fancy but were, instead, quite understated (and still a little pub-like, as I believe this place was a pub previously). No, the main problem, and quite a problem for a cafe/restaurant type place, was the food.Service and drinks came quickly as did the food when we ordered it (really quickly, in fact!) but it was all a bit of a let down. Burgers were the order of the afternoon. Something hearty but simple, with french fries for the missus and chunky chips for myself. The fries seemed to be the only enjoyable part of either of our meals as the Lady-friend's veggie burger (I forget what was in it but the complaint levelled at the insulting burger was that it was unimaginative and plain) whereas my \u00a0own (a chorizo and pork amalgamation - maybe pork, maybe beef, I've tried to scratch the whole incident from my mind) was also a little tasteless and, actually, rather dry. How can chorizo fail? I love the stuff! However, the worst part were the chunky chips. Really bad. An odd taste to them, something in between fish (surely not?) and an almost staleness. Odd and unpleasant. I left around a third of both chips and burger and went hungry, that itself a damning indictment.Perhaps a nice place to get comfy with a bottle of wine but that's the first and last time I'll be eating in Coco Momo.TTFN,Ian",
