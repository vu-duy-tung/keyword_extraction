    "text": "Authentic italian dishes, amazing, friendly staff who always greet you with a smile and an incredibly warm welcome - I can't recommend this place strongly enough! We moved to Harringay a couple of years ago and stumbled across the restaurant on Stroud Green Road just by chance, but I'm so glad we did. The first time we went it was just me and my boyfriend, but after receiving such attentive and efficient service (sorry to hear the guy's experience with his daughter's 9th birthday party - I don''t have children and have never taken children to the restaurant so my experience will obviously be somewhat different to yours, but all I can say is the staff are such good fun and usually embrace birthday parties so enthusiastically - they must've been having a very rare off day.) we've been back many times with different friends and my parents and the restaurant caters perfectly for all. The clay oven and area where the chefs make traditional italian pizzas is mesmerizing to watch and the end result is delicious! Portions are on the large size, but staff are more than happy to provide a doggy bag to take home leftovers (nothing nicer than cold pizza for lunch the next day!) so there's no waste. The atmosphere is buzzy, friendly and pretty fast, but having been just with my partner and then in groups, it suits everyone. The staff again are great at identifying a perfect table and ensuring your every need is catered for. This is one of my favourite restaurants because of the tremendous quality of food and amazing atmosphere. I feel so lucky we have this on our door stop, but if you're not local, do pay Pappagone's a visit - you won't be disappointed (erm, unless you maybe have a large party of under 9s??!)",

You do get very large portions, so if you're going for a lunchtime, it's worth asking for a smaller portion, otherwise afternoon work tends to be a little less productive!If I there is one thing I'd like them to improve, it's the wine list.

Food is good, and it is not expensive and they have a large selection of dishes, not only Pizzas although I only tried their pizzas. Servings are large and with most pizzas priced around 6 pounds, this is surely a place I recommend both for a party of people and even a date, as long as you do not mind some noise and happiness around you.",

As a vegetarian I expect that when I order a pizza vegeteriana I get a pizza devoid of any meat toppings. As I was tucking into my pizza vegetariana tonight I noticed a big pink topping (half eaten) on my slice. I turn, shocked, to my carnivourous other half and ask him what he thinks that suspicious pink topping is. He wrenches it off my slice and tells me in no uncertain way that it is the same ham featured on his pizza capriciosa! At this point I start feeling very unwell and manage to dig around in my, to my eyes, now inedible pizza to uncover some more meaty looking scraps! Oh joy. I havent had to accidently consume meat since various cultural and linguistical misunderstandings led me to eat a meat pastry in northern Brazil 2 years ago. After rejecting an offer of a different dish we didnt have to pay for our meal at all but I really wanted to love this place - being just around the corrner from my new pad but, alas, I am now sitting at home, awaiting a shop-bought pizza from my oven, swishing the physical and physcological taste of meat out of my mouth with copious amounts of cheap red wine!",

What is there not to like: Yummy pizza served by yummy Italian waiters! They greet you like they know you and haven't seen you in a while and they are charming and friendly. Sadly that night we were surrounded by screaming children and decided to retreat to tables near the bar, so we could actually hear ourselves. Otherwise a very nice eating experience with a huge pizza for me and black squid spaghetti for my friend. Great food all around.",

The staff recognise a few in our party straight away and are welcoming and jovial. The night we went, there were 15 of us. We made a reservation, were seated immediately and once we'd ordered, the starters came within 15 minutes, which was not bad at all.The thing I noticed the most about the food here was just how big the portions were! There's nothing worse when you don't get what you pay for but Pappagone is not scrimping on portions at all.Once our pizza had come, I was surprised at just how huge it was and had to share with a friend. The food was hearty and really tasty. All the pizzas are cooked in a wood-fired oven.My favourite thing about this place was their selection of tasty Italian ice-creams. I cannot begin to tell you how great the chocolate hazelnut ice cream was and you can ask to have a little taster of each flavour first.I'd definitely recommend going back if you want to celebrate a birthday or just take a bunch of friends, this is the perfect, relaxed sociable atmosphere for the start of a big night out.",

Needless to say I ended up loving it! It definitely lived up to it's motto of 'It's a nice place to stuff your face'. Even on a Sunday it was pretty busy. Our party of twenty was escorted to the back where they'd moved together smaller tables to make one long one. It definitely meant a need for co-operation if anyone wanted to go to the loo! But it was reasonably comfy once you'd found your place. Wine was quickly served (and very nice). We had a bit of a wait before the pizzas and pastas started arriving, but when they did it was in style. Suddenly waiters were zipping up and down with bulging plates, trying to locate who'd ordered what. A couple of people who'd arrived late did have a bit more of a wait before their food came, but most of the group was served within minutes, and they only had to wait about fifteen minutes more. Not bad with a group of twenty I think. The latecomers actually finished their food before I finished mine. Pizzas are made in a traditional oven near the front of the restaurant. Pasta appears from a (visible) kitchen at the back. My pizza was lovely. Crispy, slightly irregular base, rich cheese, creamy spinach and ricotta, flavoursome sun dried tomatoes. My only problem with it was it was a little rich, and I had to resort to a ginger beer to keep my tummy settled! Actually there seemed to be a little bit of a problem and a wait before my drink appeared, and I suspect they may have sent out for it. Top points for that if so. Everybody's food looked lovely and fresh, and some swapping took place! On a budget of about \u00a310 per head we all had a main and wine, and left with stuffed stomachs and in a happy mood. Definitely recommended.",

They have a very wide bar floor, where you can watch football on the big screen, choose between a selection of cocktails, and also order and eat your pizza. Pizza is the reason to go there, but especially if you have something to celebrate, like a birthday, tell to a member of staff, and they will bring you a surprise-pudding... It lost its flair during the years, now the place has become a busy money-machine, but it's still worth a go for a night in good company.",

Well, check your pulse because you may actually be dead.It's an awesome place, full of great Italian vibe and the food is fantastico! I have taken a few of my Italian friends there and they were rally impressed so that's telling. The waiters and chefs are all Italian and super friendly. The pizzas are yummy and not too expensive at all. Even though it's a pizzeria, you can find bigger selection of Italian cousine there. The place can get pretty crowded on the weekends but definitely worth a visit. There is a little bar there too and you can watch footie on the screen too while enjoying the sound of vuvuzelas.",

Sure, I flirted with Porchetta next door for a while, but they lost me the day my sister poured sugar all over her pizza after mistaking it for grated parmesan. Pappagone would never trick one of my family like that, no matter how dim she is. No, Pappagone's look after you... \"Hey, you're a regular... have some free limoncello!\" The atmosphere is always fun, which goes someway to explaining the usual queue to get a table. Both Pappagone's and Porchetta next door are big, loud and do a range of luscious thin crust stone-baked Italian pizzas and big slurpy pasta dishes. It's weird that two of the best pizzas in England are side-by-side in Finsbury Park. Is it the air? Porchetta have gone on to become a chain around town, but Pappagone's remains original with that great Italian family feeling. That's why I've joined their gang. I love eating here.",

Normally I just stick to the pizzas, but this time I went the full 3 courses. We had the Bocconcini Fritti (deep fried Buffalo Mozzarella in a tomato sauce) who doesn't like deep fried cheese and we also had Burratina Pugliese more mozzarella and aubergines, WINNER! I stuck to pizza Parmigiana for the main, always good, I love the variety of vegetarian options and pizzas they have available. I had sticky toffee pudding for dessert (which is the best dessert ever), although I definitely want to try the Gelato they are so well known when I go back.Service in there is always pleasant, yes you may have a wait for a table but they are happy for you to stand at the bar and take your name down, so no annoying queuing. Despite it being epically busy we were served quickly, the waitress was happy, helpful and being next to the open kitchen gave us the chance to thank the kitchen staff personally.I honestly cannot say enough good things about this place, they are also on Deliveroo (so you can now get takeout delivered from them), I have a feeling Pizzeria Pappagone may be seeing the most of my paycheck.",

The carbonara that my friend had tasty but so greasy it left him feeling queasy at the pool of oil staring back at him after he finished. My aubergine, tomato & mozzarella sauce was better. And the place is super noisy even at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon, little kids and day drinkers. Some people like that liveliness, but we didn't like shouting just so we can hear each other",

Pappagone has always been a popular destination for diners, it's food has always been excellent, the staff are always friendly and prices are affordable. The restaurant has an a cafe style outside where you can sit and enjoy the sun and the crowds walking past. The interior is well decorated and has a family friendly feel. I couldn't help but order the pizza and an ice cold beer. The pizza was good though the toppings could have been spread out more evenly. I was really after something spicy but didn't want pepperoni... Unfortunately I couldn't see any diavolo so had to go with the chilli oil which was the real stuff. The tirrimisu was home made and large enough for the two of us. Pappagone is a great place to meet with friends and family. Id be happy to have this as my local any day.",

The tomato sauce added an extra kick as there was a slighty spicy taste to it. Good start, thank you Dan.For the main, I went for my tried and tested Calzone, as I wanted to compare it to the calzone at La Porchetta. The filling here was salami, ham, mozzarella and black olives. The pizza was tasty and very filling but didn't have the richness and depth that I'm used to at La Porchetta. However, after the calzone I didn't feel to stuffed and I know that I will definitely be back again and again.

The staff was rushed off feet it seems but told us to come in and was fine to wait around by bar area (bit squashed to wait there though) but good intentions.We eventually got a table for 4 in about 30 mins later with our beers still in tow. Now I did enjoy the ambiance but I can't help feel on this one visit that the pizza were slightly overrated. I feel pizza have to have some subtle differences (Franco Manca crust for example) in order for them to stand out. Here it didn't really, and I found the crust on my ham, artichoke and egg pizza a bit soggy. Was almost too thin for my liking (which probably caused this). Was nice and fresh but just didn't really do anything for me to make it memorable.As I say I did really like the vibe and being so close to my football team I am definitely willing to come again and try and another one for an updated review.",

Seriously, try to get a table for four on a weekend evening and you're probably in for quite a wait...but this wait is well worth spending.The food is solid in all instances...it's not epicurian heaven, but all the dishes that we sampled (pastas, pizzas, starters) were tasted fantastic and the whole buzz around you contributed to your party having a good time as well. (Having said that, I would probably not go here on a romantic date, nor alone...that might just be a little bit too depressing! ;-)Nevertheless...try out this local gem!",

Yet to be able to finish a pizza but they are happy to box up left overs so you can take home. The pasta and anti-pasta dishes are also great quality and everything is very reasonably priced.If I could change one thing it would be a slightly bigger wine list.If you are in the area you have got to eat here!",
