I have been to Rome recently so I'd lying if I said that they are the best I've tasted in my life (those belong in Rome, for sure). But they are the best I've tasted in London, no question about it. I went on a Saturday at lunchtime and there was a massive queue, that lasted until 4pm. Still, you don't have to wait much because all tables are shared, pizzas are cooked in 2 minutes and you basically eat and go. We waited for about 30min. and I guarantee it was worth it. Also the homemade lemonade was really good. I totally recommend this place.",

    "text": "Now we all know that mood and circumstances can entirely change your view of a restaurant. A crap day at work followed by the most minor of altercations with a waitress can lead to the decision that it's got the worst customer service in the world. A joint with mediocre food will still be fantastic if it was the location for a great first date. And if you're suffering from the worst hangover EVER FELT BY MAN OR BEAST and finally break your 12-hour self-induced fast (because to even consider a morsel of food passing your lips is nothing short of torture) with pizza which is - by all other accounts - pretty bloomin lovely, then it's hardly surprising that it lodges in your memory as the Best Pizza Of All Time.Maybe it's the delightfully light and flavoursome sourdough base. \u00a0Maybe it's the fresh ingredients, perfectly proportioned into delicious and unusual combinations. \u00a0Maybe it's the super friendly staff. \u00a0Maybe it's because it's in Brixton. (I really do love Brixton). \u00a0Maybe it's the fact that I had been comatose in my friend's flat for the whole day, unable to consume more than the occasional cup of tea, and then announced at 4pm \"Food. I need food now\" and she showed me the website and we ordered it on the phone and 10 minutes later I collected it in my pyjamas and 10 minutes after that it was in my mouth. \u00a0Maybe it was all those things. \u00a0Maybe it's just very good pizza.",

    "text": "Being \u00a0bit of a food geek, I had grown extremely excited from all of the stories I had heard about organic sourdough pizza restaurant Franco Manca. I had heard the rumours about the lengthy and complicated process that goes toward making the pizza's, and I had also heard that it was one of the best pizza restaurants to come out of Italy. At the risk of putting my neck on the line and sounding like a PR agent, this is probably an understatement. Set in the humble surroundings of Brixton market, at a glance Franco Manca has a seemingly questionable atmosphere that some might consider off putting. When you start eating your pizza (which took under five minutes to arrive at my seat), this almost becomes an important part of eating at Franco Manca; that food that is this good can be so easily accessible, and at such a small price (around \u00a33 - \u00a36 per pizza). The menu might seem that it lacks in variety, but this is because they are relying on traditional and authentic Neapolitan recipes, and I think that is one of the best ways to describe this pizza: it tastes authentic, and is so much better for it as well.The presentation of the pizza itself can be quite unpredictable, and unlike a lot of the perfectly circular pizzas we have become accustomed to; but this aids to the pizza's benefit for, in the final stages of making the pizza one shouldn't over roll the dough for you'll squeeze the life out of it. It's then put in the oven at a whopping 500 degrees for 40 seconds, before arriving at your plate. I was quite surprised at how thick the pizza is as well, but it's light, doughy, and chard to the perfect level; I was always under the presumption that thinner was better, but have thusly been proven wrong.Accompanied with a glass of the best organic lemonade you can come across, or a glass of fine organic wine, you can be safe in the knowledge that everything at Franco Manca is as incredibly well considered as the pizzas here. The only thing you have to make sure of is that you get there between it's short opening hours of 12pm - 5pm, otherwise you may miss one of the most exciting taste experiences of the week. It almost makes you wonder that, if pizza can be this good, and at such a low cost, what the hell have all the other pizza restaurants been playing at?",

They were both absolutely amazing, in true Italian style.I had an amazing traditional lemonade, and my partner had the slightly fizzy house red. Everything about the place is authentically Italian.

Every pizza is made to order so will arrive at your table piping hot with bubbling mozzarella! YUM! Beer and wine available by the glass or bottle - the wine list is short and well picked. Complimentary grapes to bring out the great flavors on the pizzas. My suggestion - get yourself down there with a few mates and order a different one each to share - that way you get to try them all!

The service can be a bit full on. It's Italian. Not just Italian, it's Napolitan. The waiter might be on the side of rude, he or she may shout, you might have to share a table with others, but it will probably be the best pizza you have had in London. It is pretty cheap too. 7 quid or so for a pizza. There is not a lot of choice and they choose to keep it basic (like it should be). It is authentic pizza with ingredients primarily from Campagnia (province around Naples). They use British meat, but the all important tomatoes and mozarella is from where it should be. Simply delicous. An absolute must for anyone who loves pizza!",

    "text": "Visited again with B this Saturday and I can confirm this is now my favourite pizza place in London. We shared one of the daily specials, which came with Italian sausage, and a number three (Gloucester old spot, two cheeses, tomato sauce and no mushrooms). Both just delicious and not a crust left on the plate. Large friendly queues again but it seems to thin out after 3.30pm so make it a late lunch!! I have been meaning to check out Franco Manca for some time having heard nothing but good things about it. My first attempt to visit was about 6 months ago but much to my disappointment we turned up just as they were shutting up for the day. As B had headed North for a girlie weekend I thought this would be an ideal opportunity to hook up with an old pal and treat myself to some of South London's finest pizza. It's situated in the thriving covered Brixton Market and I arrived nice and early so I could pick up a few bits and pieces and have a wander round the market which has changed quite a bit since I was a regular visitor in the late 90's. I came across Franco Manca at about 11.45am and it was already packed with a pretty sizeable queue waiting for a table. I was meeting my pal in the nearby Prince Albert for a cold beer or two to build up an appetite and it was about 2.30 when we returned for our pizza and the place was still heaving. We joined the queue and after about 5 minutes we were given a copy of the short menu and we ordered while we waited; no more than 10 minutes later and we were seated sipping a very good value Ottavio Rube, Colli Tortonesi 2009 . Big, bold and bursting with flavour this lovely organic wine was a great complement to the pizza at a bargain price of \u00a310.95 a bottle. Split over two rooms, each side of the walkway through the market, with a few tables outside this is a busy, bustling dining experience. A million miles away from the likes of Pizza Express et al and all the better for it. On this very chilly Saturday we were lucky to get a seat at a table inside which we gratefully shared with two other, very pleasant, pizza loving couples. This room also houses the specially constructed brick, wood burning oven and believe me it's a bad boy. This is a great spot to sit and soak up some top quality pizza porn and watch the lovely and entertaining staff bustle about. The pizzas have a thin sourdough base which is crispy with a slightly chewy texture and come with a small selection of topping; if I remember correctly the menu had 6 choices with a couple of specials listed on the blackboard. The dough itself is, as you would imagine, just a touch sour and has a very special quality due to the resting period of 20 hours. For those of you who don't like cheese I would say Franco's is still a great place to visit as the sourdough base works very well without a cheese topping. I went for the number 5 which was an amazing taste sensation. The most flavoursome base I have ever had the pleasure of devouring smeared in a rich tomato sauce, dotted with mozzarella and a scattering of small pieces of luscious dried and semi dried chorizo. Oh my lord, for a minute I thought I had passed away and gone to gourmet pizza heaven. My non cheese loving pal, Geordie boy, had a very simple topping selection of the tomato sauce with some Gloucester old spot ham and was well pleased with his choice. Despite the fact that there was a continual queue waiting to get in we felt in no way rushed to down our wine, even after we had eaten every last morsel of our pizza. We finished off with a very decent espresso around 4.30pm, declared ourselves to be more than happy with this first introduction to the joys of Franco Manca, thanked the lovely waiting staff and headed off into Coldharbour Lane in search of The Dogstar ......... Note to self \u00a0do yourself a big favour and make the effort to visit Brixton and Franco Manca again sometime soon.",

Millimetre-thin, chewy, sourdough goodness, cooked to 260 degrees of perfection in a wood-fired kiln. Then it's one of just six (a simplicity that Gordon Ramsey would approve of) appetising toppings. I went for the margerita, composed of tomato sauce, good quality and (THANK YOU) sparingly applied mozzarella cheese. All for a standing-ovation-worthy price of \u00a36. Woohoo!There are a couple of small things I'd change if I was being reallllllly fussy. The tomato sauce for one, which I'd infuse with slightly sweeter cherry tomatoes. Plus the sourdough base seemed a little salty. But in truth, that seems like ungrateful pickiness considering just how awe-thumm and far ahead of their competition in London Franco Manca's pizzas are. An essential stop for pizza lovers and foodies alike!",

    "text": "I've enjoyed the Tottenham Court Road location a few times, so when some friends and I found ourselves in Brixton Market looking for a late lunch, we decided to try the original Franco Manca, and I have to say that these guys make my favorite pizzas in London and vie with 2Amys in DC for the only pizzas I actively seek out outside Campania - I don't usually like pizza very much, but I love Franco Manca's dedication to excellent ingredients. I most often go for Pizza 5, with anchovies, wild capers and legit Kalamata olives (a rare find in Britain - most olives in this country are sub-par). In the past, I've had great burata and bresaola starters from the specials board. I've tasted most of their pizzas over several visits by stealing bites from friends and nothing has been not delicious, so order whatever sounds good to you. Both food and drink are highly curated. Our server gently berated our friend when he tried to order a Diet Coke, which they do not have - but why would you want Diet Coke when they have delicious organic lemonade? Their short and to-the-point beverage list has everything you need - most importantly, Ottavio Rube's organic Barbera, made in an old-school herbaceous style. I would go there just to drink it - it is very hard to find offerings in that style in London (Ottolenghi has a lot of old-school dusty, herbal, beeswax-candle-scented wines that would taste at home in an ancient fortress, but not many other restaurants do - especially at Franco Manca's affordable price point). Their beers drink nicely too, as does the cortese white wine. They have a Sangiovese and (I think) Trebbiano, also organic and from Ottavio Rube, listed as being more fruit-forward and modern, but I haven't tried those due to the opportunity cost of missing out on Ottavio's Barbera. Yes, it's that good and a steal for \u00a314 a bottle. Three of us had lunch with wine for a total of \u00a337, a fantastic value given the quality. Actually, Franco Manca may have one of the best price-quality ratios on the London food scene. One note about the Brixton location - the fishmonger next door can become \"fragrant.\" I don't mind that, but if you don't like fish smells, you may be better off trying a different location. But if the aromatics don't bug you, go and have fun people-watching in Brixton Market and fill up on delicious pizza and organic wine. It makes for a fun Saturday afternoon.",

But once my order was in, my pizza pie came out in no time.And wow, this was the best pizza i've ever had outside of brooklyn (haven't been to italy yet). It was a sensation, I ordered the special with spicy wild hog cappacola, a bed of arugula/rocket, and fresh grated parm. The toppings complimented the true stars of the show, the crust, sauce, and mozz. 7 quid for this pizza! If anyone lives around brixton or around clapham, why would anyone order pizza from anywhere else? This is around the same price as pizza express or pizza hut except it's the real thing.",

    "text": "OK, there is no place that is immune to criticism, and nothing is perfect, but the pizza at Franco Manca's comes pretty dang close. \u00a0I am more than a bit of a pizza nut, spending many free hours experimenting with the best formulas for my home dough-making; so when I heard that this place was opening last year a couple miles from my house I was more than a little excited.Since then, I've been quite a few times, and the only thing that I think could really improve is the service. \u00a0Spotty at times, and often getting water for the table is a nigh-impossible task. \u00a0But never unfriendly, and then there's those pizzas....Now, I think it's worth mentioning that this is a very specific kind of pizza - authentic Neapolitan pizza, and as such, it won't be crispy from edge to edge, the sauce won't be exotic, and there won't be cheese slathered on every square inch. \u00a0But it is just so delicious. \u00a0The dough is unreal, with a maturity and depth of flavour never seen in virtually any other place in London...the starter that they use for the dough is from a 200+-year old batch from Ischia.The sauce is just canned tomatoes (where from, it's their secret) with a dash of salt. \u00a0They flew over a master cheese maker from the Sorrento to go to an organic farm and teach them the proper way to make fior di latte -- eventually, they will be using a supplier in Somerset, one of the few farms in England that produces buffalo milk, for authentic mozzarella.So yes, in the Neapolitan tradition, the sauce is slapped on, a few pieces of cheese torn and tossed over, but I can't think of anything more delicious. \u00a0I've had the chorizo a few times as well, and whilst the pork is spicy, meaty and quite good, I love the simple Margherita which allows me to taste just dough, tomato sauce and cheese.Salads are generally a bit of a let down, as I've often had a bowl of fennel with a few lettuce leaves, but the homemade lemonade is cloudy, tart and fantastic.I love Franco Manca. \u00a0Did I mention that?",

They have a small range of salads, but don't do desserts or sides. The pizzas... I had a 'number 4' which is anchovies, capers, oregano, garlic and olives. It was delicious, I've never had pizza as tasty! It was a bit soggy in the middle but that just added to the general pizza-ness.The atmosphere was incredible, there were good tunes on, the staff were rushing around, the chefs were shouting and there was banter between all the staff and customers. There were evidently some regulars there too, but based on the pizza we had, I'm not surprised!It cost us \u00a321 for 3 of us to have a lovely pizza each and one americano (the others had the free filtered water). I thought that was amazingly reasonable for beautiful pizzas. I've just found out that they've opened a branch in Chiswick, so I'll be visiting them asap!",

    "text": "I am officially the last person in the world to eat at Franco Manca, but I finally made it to the Brixton market this weekend, which was a thinly veiled excuse to eat at Franco Manca. I would say the place 85% lived up to the hype, which is to say the food was delicious & cheap, and i loved the atmosphere, right in the middle of the market and all of its chaos. We ate really early, so we didn't need to queue, which seems to be a great secret of eating here- if you get here right before noon, you can claim a table before they have started to serve, and you won't have to wait forever. The pizzas were great, but we all agreed that the more unusual toppings were better than the classic Margherita. I think it's pretty overhyped, but I still thought it was a great pizza and a great find. If I'm back in Brixton, I'll definitely be back, but I'm not sure I'd travel across London again JUST to eat here.",

Strange opening hours - closed by 5pm on a Saturday and not open Sunday make Saturdays on place barley bearable, but then well despite the often hour plus wait the food is GOOD. How good? Real good. Simple pizzas, great flavours - this place truly proves that less really is more. And cheap to boot.",

The organic lemonade is also good and a steal at \u00a31 but the biggest bargain of all is the organic wines which are \u00a31.20 a glass.Can you believe it!! It does get busy on Saturdays as it is only open until four but I have never had to wait more than 15 minutes as the service is so efficient and on a Satuday they have the two Italian guys waitering who are fantastic and will keep you entertained whilst you wait. It is in Brixton Market Row so you can people watch whilst you enjoy your pizza. It is much quieter and calmer if you visit during the week and the staff are very nice but I lovely the Saturday buzz this place has. I have been many times and have always left with a big smile.",

    "text": "I've just come back from Franco Manca where greed got the better of my colleague and me and we ordered three 12\" plus diameter pizzas between the two of us and polished them off, just. Franco Manca burst onto the scene a couple of years backin a flurry of amazing reviews. Folk waxed lyrical amount the sourdough bases and wood fired oven handbuilt and shipped in from Naples. People hopped on the tube to get there between the hours of 12pm to 5pm on a weekday and queued to get in. I was blown away by the food today. I'd probably say it's the best pizza I've eaten in London. The stand out feature is definitely the sourdough crust, light and airy from the immense heat but with a chewy crumb which you can only get from a long fermentation, charred yet soft - I was flabbergasted when the bloke on the table next door left most of his crusts. For topping one had chorizo (Brindisa, dry and semi-dry), another anchovy, olive and caper one and finally the day's special of ham and artichoke. The chorizo was good, slices and lumps of the sausage, both yielding to the heat and releasing their paprika red oil all over the pizza. I sometimes feel that it takes over though, rendering every mouthful identical in flavour - even if that flavour's very nice. To moisten we had a glass of the red each, cheap at \u00a31.40 a glass but a tad tannic for my palate, it went a lot better with the pizza than it did on its own though. All this came to a little over a tenner each. If we'd not been such gluttons, sticking to a single large pizza each, we'd be talking \u00a38 for a fantastic meal. There are some photos of the pizzas here: cookingthebooks.typepad.\u2026",

    "text": "Calm down people ...it's only an overated pizza place Honestly it's hard to compare pizza as the base is different (sourdough) to the majority of other pizza bases , but taking this into account it's slightly above average but not the best in the UK .....The queue was long but we went in a couple and were advanced to the front which was lucky , otherwise it is a 40 min wait .....the waitress was nice enough but we couldn't order more than 2 pizzas at a go for the basic fact the table was small and cramped and we had to share with another couple . Keep a lookout on the specials which is out of the way and we were rushed through and not giving an option of choosing it . We choose the blanco white pizza and the margerita - the base was ok and the ingrediants were of good quality but the overall taste was ok . The lemonade was not to my liking but was to my partners - it was gloopy and looked like stale pee , it tasted erm very natural . I felt rushed and hurried and cramped which probaly contributed to this not so great review . sorry franco manca your not all that ..but you are just above average",

    "text": "I realised that people not only come to this particular Franco Manca for it's famous sourdough pizza but also for the atmosphere, the location and the vibe. Brixton is becoming very popular and just located in Market Row, a small indoor dining complex located Franco Manca amongst many other popular food joints like Honest Burger. It is funny how earlier that evening we walked pass the Franco Manca near Warren Street and it was only half empty only to arrive at this particular joint and find a long queue forming already. But as it is a one dish place unless you order a starter on the side which arrives with the main anyway, the queue does move quick. My expectations were high as I have heard so much about their pizza, many voting them the best pizza in London which is a big thing considering how many pizza places there are. It was nice to see the different group types from friends to family and even children. It is a place that caters for everyone, if you like pizza that is. After a half an hour wait we managed to get a seat outside with electric heaters from above to warm us up. All tables are made for sharing here. Long beach like chairs facing marbled tables that can sit 6 people round it. As everyone is ordering roughly the same thing you do feel quite united and part of this pizza culture. If you don't like people watching you eat then I'm afraid you're in the wrong place as that is exactly what you will be doing when queuing and people in the queue will do when your pizza arrives. I was immediately attracted by the meat special which was a tomato based pizza topped with prosciutto, parmesan shavings and fresh rocket whilst my boyfriend looking something towards the seafood range went for the tomato, oregano, capers, garlic, anchovies, mozerella with added chorizo. With that we washed it down with organic lemonade that was a sugary treat to balance the saltiness of the pizza. Now I'm not usually a crust person but one bite into the dough and already the pizza has won me over. It was that nice charry, smokey flavour of the thinly rolled out based, slightly crisp on top and chewy that really got me hooked and after another bite. My special was definitely my favourite out of the two. Deliciate cheesy flavours coming from the mozzarella contrasted with the more stronger flavour of the thinly sliced prosciutto. Depth was added from the stronger Parmesan shavings which went nicely with the rocket that gave that punch of peppery flavour to the pizza. My boyfriend's anchovies pizzas was slightly too overpowering for me, too salty for me to taste and enjoy the dough itself. Most of the ingredients were strong in flavour. Maybe it was a bad idea we added chorizo on top as that itself was overly salted and could be reduced. I would have also preferred if the chorizo was a bit thicker and it was dried out and probably why it was so salty because all the moisture had evaporated. But beside from that I did enjoy the strong notes of garlic and the sharp, piquant flavours from the capers when eating it without the chorizo or the anchovies. It definitely needs some sort of side salad to balance it all out. But my boyfriend didn't seem to mind and demolished the whole pizza without a single compliant. I am very much looking forward to trying Franco Manca again, probably another site to compare the consistency throughout their restaurants. As their cured meat is way too salty and some to dry, next time I might a vegetarian variety instead. Although busy service was not rushed and very efficient with a smile.",

At the risk of sounding repetitive, what makes a good pizza is getting the basics perfect, and Franco Manca certainly does that. Fresh cheese, perfectly charred doughy crusts, interesting topping combinations. *mwah*So flavourful, my taste buds were beside themselves with joy. I ate my entire pizza by myself, which is really saying something for me.Top this off with delish organic beer from Sam Smith's (I'm not generally a lager lady, but I'd convert for this stuff) and the charming seating arrangement that let's you people-watch all the interesting folk who frequent Brixton Market. (Though, I imagine it's a bit tricky finding a spot in the colder months as a lot of the seating seems to be unsheltered.)And, oh my god, all so reasonably priced. You'd be hard-pressed to spend more than a tenner of a lunchtime. Winner.",

We came when it was just starting to get cold so the wait was a bit annoying, even though they did have outdoor heating. 45 minutes to an hour... for pizza. We stood right next to the people who were seated outside eating, so we were starving when we finally got seated. My expectations were much higher after the long wait, but the pizza did just meet my expectations. Fresh toppings and a great combination of ingredients on a thin layer of pizza dough, but I thought they could have added more because having a pizza each, we were all still hungry. We shared a bottle of wine and watched uncomfortably at the people who were waiting right in front of us, which was where we were just standing earlier before. If it wasn't for this I did really like this place... it's a cute, homey mini-restaurant that serves delicious fresh pizza.",

I must have come here close to 10 times in my short 3 month stay in London and I lived in Kensington, not that close to Brixton. It is that good.Alan's 5 Slices Review SystemI've had many but I'll review my favorite. Tomato, Cured Organic Chorizo (Dry & Semi-Dry) and Mozzarella+1 (1/1) Crust- One of the best crusts of ANY pizza place I've been to, Italy and New York included. They use a very unique sourdough crust that is so soft and a bit doughie. Tastes like perfectly baked bread.+.9 (1.9/2) Sauce- Very simple sauce of what tastes of fresh tomatoes turned into sauce and a sprig of basil. What makes it great is how fresh it is how the flavor that comes from such simple ingredients.+1 (2.9/3) Cheese- Love the cheese. Nice and flavorful buffalo mozzarella. Always tastes so fresh. Not the weepy, waterykind, this kind keeps its flavor intact and lets the sauce do its own thing.+.8 (3.7/4) Toppings- Two very nice types of chorizo. One a flatter and one thicker. They flatter one looked a bit like salami or pepperoni, but had a classic chroizo taste. The thicker one was even more flavorful and juicy. Both extremely flavorful and authentic. +.9 (4.6/5) Atmosphere/Service/Price- This location is just a stones through from the main street of Brixton market. Not a place where you would think of an amazing pizza place, but that gives it some of its charm. It is an astoundingly good deal for any of the pizzas, but the classic Margarita is only 5.50. If you can find a better deal in the ridiculously overpriced city of London, please let me know.Service is always great, even though they are usually quite busy. Good for sit down and take away. They have the tables split across both sides of the path, but it works. They have a great Samuel Smith's organic lager that goes nicely with the pizzas.Final Score:Franco Manca - 4.6 slices out of 5Best pizza place in London, probably the UK and in my top 10 of all time.",

    "text": "The Guardian and TimeOut have both said this is the best Pizza in the UK and though I've not tried many of the country's pizza restaurants it's hard to imagine a more winning combination of delicious food at bargain prices.When setting this, the original branch up about 5 years ago real passion went into the set-up. Artisans were flown over from Naples to hand build the special brick ovens. Specialist cheese makers were brought over from Italy to a farm in Somerset to teach them how to make perfect Mozzarella just for Franco Manca and all of the ingredients are high quality, seasonal and fresh. The Dough, which you should finish as it says on the menu, is sourdough and is left to rise for at least 20 hours before cooking at 500\u00baC for 5 minutes (leaving it crisp on the outside but chewy inside).You only get the choice of 6 different pizzas, plus specials, salads and drinks and there are no starters, no desserts, only 1 kind of wine or lager. At busy periods you will have to queue for as much as 45 mins (though generally less), service can be a bit shaky (though this is made up for by the hilarious manager who is a bundle of energy and ensures you are seated and eating as quick as humanly possible) and there is no lingering; once you are finished eating they want you out to seat the next people but this is more than made up for by the fantastic quality of the food and the incredibly low prices.Basically it's under \u00a37 for a whole pizza, half the price of chains like Pizza Express and far better quality.I cannot recommend this place highly enough, long may it last and maintain it's standards!",

Might be a wait to get seated, but the table turnover is quick as the pizza seems to come out of the oven almost immediately after you order it, so don't worry about the queue. A friend and I split two different pies - one with wild broccoli, mozzarella and sausage, and the other with ham, mozzarella, wild mushrooms and buffalo ricotta. The ingredients are fresh and organic; the sourdough base is light and each pizza is more than enough food for one person. The buffalo ricotta was my fave. Go get it!",

Really like the communal dining tables where if theres a space you take it even if your sitting next to a total stranger. Been to Franco Manca 4 or 5 times in total and always start with the salad. Its O.K but nothing special. I think its a touch on the pricey side considering what your getting.Having been to Italy a few times I'm in agreement with the Italians that there are only a couple of official pizza toppings. For me the fewer the better and what better than a \u00a0basic Margarita?At its best FM can tango with the best of them. The 'sloppy' intensely tomato'y taste and texture of the topping combined with the wonderful mozzarella \u00a0and chewy in the centre crisp on the outside sourdough base is just wonderful. I've had the Organic Lemonade a couple of times which is O.K but overly small and overly expensive.Pizza as it really should be. My only reservations are that on 2 occasions the pizza was over cooked leaving small areas of burnt bits which tasted acrid. Both times were busy so I now avoid at busy times.Also not sure if its just me or I've been unlucky or theres something more sinister going on but every time I've been (a part from once) I've been over charged i.e. an item that I didn't have had been added to my final bill i.e. an expresso.",

It was worth it. The pizzas here are seriously good - they are right in saying that because they use a sourdough base, the edge is absolutely delicious. Chewy and tasty. The toppings are very fresh. I had the number four, with ricotta and old spot ham, and it was a revelation. The ricotta tasted like it had been made that day, and the salty ham with it was great. My friend had the margarita which wasn't boring at all - down to the cheese, I think. The restaurant itself is basic - you'll probably share a table with strangers if you're a pair - but because of the pizza oven it smells delicious. Staff are rushing around and the mood on a Friday night was very convivial. Yes, you do have to wait. And it's not a particularly pleasant place to wait, to be honest. Also, the house wine, organic or not, wasn't to my taste. But, much to my chagrin, the pizza IS worth it. You can get takeaway.",

Yes, I can see the fuss, especially with a few brews to accompany a slice, but given I'm not the greatest with cheese I normally pass. BUT, I dropped in at the Broadway Market spot with a few friends one Sunday eve and what a great surprise. The restaurant is tiny, so expect to clamber over some other diners when finding your seat. But this will be a rewarded challenge as the menu and the food are great. Sourdough base, piping hot and fresh ingredients made this an excellent quick bite. The service was perfect and they were kind enough to drop the cheese even though a lot of people still can't get the head around a pizza with no cheese. Arguably the best thing about this spot though, the price. Our bill came to about 8 pound each, which for food of this quality is insane.From a not-so-overly keen fan of Pizza go.

The menu is pretty simple, with a good selection of different toppings. The specials (displayed on chalkboards, obviously) change regularly and are particularly good. You can add toppings as with most restaurants, but unhelpfully there's no real information about how much individual extra toppings cost.Sometimes there's a queue, but arriving around 7 on a non-Friday weeknight should allow you to be seated swiftly and get some good pizza in your belly. The staff are fast and friendly enough, meaning if you have a small party you can get in and out fast (if you don't mind potentially sharing a big table with another party).

We shared a regular pizza and a tomato/garlic/oregano pizza. The regular pizza was delicious! So was the garlic one, but it was actually a bit too garlicky for us - surprising, considering we both put garlic in everything! Also surprising was the service. Considering how quick the line ended up moving to get in, we both expected to feel rushed through our meal. Instead, the staff never pushed us and, in fact, encouraged us to sit and order more if we wanted. They also took their time bringing us the check - both good (in the sense that they weren't rushing us out) and bad (in the sense that, well, we were ready to go!).The real draw here is the dough, and they didn't disappoint.

    "text": "\u00a37 for a more-than-satisfying personal pizza pie fresh out of the oven really isn't a shabby deal. Especially when it's dotted all over with two types of chorizo. (To me, it looked more like one type of chorizo and one type of pepperoni.)For an ultra-fast in-and-out in under twenty minutes kind of lunch, Franco Manca has it going on. This no-frills joint is both affordable, expedient, and satisfying. And likely only readily visitable during the weekdays, when it's less rammed.Plus, it appears to be the real deal: the lady sitting next to us who was paying as we arrived spoke with one of the servers in Italian. That seems to indicate a certain level of authenticity, in my book.... and had I not had even -more- delicious pizza and pasta later on in the same day (yep, Italian twice in under eight hours! I'm a glutton), Franco's would absolutely deserve five glowing stars.",

Some tiny blobs of green goop here and there and a couple of puddles of animal matter regurgitated in the middle. That is all. It doesn't even look appetising, sorry. Prices are good, but then again you're basically paying for flour here. If you're a vegetarian then perhaps it's more up your alley.

Now that I live in London, I have flat out given up on trying to find decent pizza. Sadly after having been told that Franco Manca knows how to do pizza, I am once again disappointed. Is the service good? Yeah. Are the prices reasonable? Yeah. Is the flavor good? Eh, it's alright. Is the dough soggy like every other pizza place in London? Absolutely. I don't understand why pizza places in London insist on either not cooking the dough to completion or cooking to completion but having the very end of the pizza (the small end; the opposite end of the crust) soggy and not firm. I think my quest to find decent pizza in London is in vain.",

However the 2* for this place was the service and the place itself. It was grotty, the service was rude and we were sat outside on a bench when it was BLOODY FREEZING!For food - we shared a burrata (their burrata is amazing - you gotta try!), a cheesy garlic bread and their No.6 (pepperoni pizza - which had plenty of pepperoni this time). My bf went for a No Logo beer and I went for a white wine (both fine). The food came reasonably quickly which was ideal as I was starving and freeeeezing. However actually getting a waitress to take our order took forever as did getting seated even though the table was free and he said he was seating us right away. We had the same issue getting someone to bring the bill, then the card machine but eventually paid up and made a run for the tube station to warm up.",

My friends have been hyping it up for me for months, but I honestly think it has lived up to the hype. \u00a0They don't do reservations, and it's first come-first serve; so I was very delighted when we were seated quickly on a Saturday night (around 6:30pm). Just be aware that if you come later, it's likely you'll be in a massive queue.The pizzas were amazing. They came out quickly and the sourdough crust just melts in your mouth! I was even brave enough to try my very first anchovy pizza! And I loved how we made our own as well: a delectable combo of ham, blue cheese and artichoke. It was all delicious and I was very satisfied. The hardest thing about the menu is that everything is cheap! I just want to order the entire menu for myself! I may just do so the next time I'm back in Brixton.During the winter season, it is very cold. And depending on where you'll be seated (inside or outside), you should just keep your coat on.

The sourdough base is soft and correct and although you have the option to add toppings, I prefer Neopolitan pizzas when they are kept simple. I may have ruined mine a little by adding too much on top, but if I happen to be in Franco Manca again, I will be smarter and enjoy the dough with the sauce and cheese alone. The lemonade here is really excellent too.The lines here are a bit crazy sometimes. It was empty, so I went somewhere else for 10 minutes and when I came back there was a line down the block.

I ordered a pizza expecting it not to be dry, or at least to be told it was dry before ordering it. However, I would definitely go again! \u00a0Sourdough charge onnnn!",

Boy have they nailed their pizzeria game!We did have to wait around 20 mins for a table (Saturday evening), but were served drinks while we waited before being seated in the overflow room next door.This still felt very much a part of the restaurant (and perhaps slightly less packed), and service was good. The sourdough pizza is absolutely delicious, and the toppings were simple and tasty in the true Italian style. Oils are provided for crust-dipping and the bread we shared before our meal was great.Even with shared starters, aperitifs, mains, beers and two bottles of wine, the bill only came to just over \u00a320 each (for 5 of us). Time will tell whether Franco Manca's is just a fad or becomes an established favourite, but I'm certainly planning to return.",

My friend and I ordered 2 specials from the blackboard and split them both (something with white sauce and veggies), and kept going back and forth because we couldn't decide which was better/which taste we wanted to leave in our mouths. Not to mention, I rarely eat my crusts and yet finished off every bite of this soft, sourdoughy goodness. Oh and the organic lemonade is delicious too. Just make sure you get there right when they open at 12 so you can get a table...it fills up quickly.You will thank me later.",

    "text": "What a delightful discovery this pizzeria is. \u00a0It's very different from the ubiquitous Pizza Express (which I generally quite like), Pizza Hut (which I hate) and other such establishments. \u00a0Located in an indoor section of Brixton Market, it's a small establishment with interior and exterior seating, each on a different side of the market arcade. The sourdough-based pizzas are large and delicious. \u00a0I had a broccoli, mozzarella and chorizo one on my recent visit. \u00a0It was wonderful. You cannot get the usual range of commercial soft drinks (Coca Cola and the like). \u00a0Instead, the menu offers such delights as organic lemonade, organic orange juice, organic wine and beer! \u00a0My lemonade was very tasty indeed. \u00a0Service is speedy, friendly and efficient. \u00a0This is probably not a place to go to if you want to take your time over a relaxing meal. \u00a0A fairly rapid turnover is encouraged by the proprietors (I suspect, given the limited table space, that there needs to be in order to ensure that the place makes a profit). Prices are very reasonable indeed (my main course and drink came to only \u00a39, including service). \u00a0The bustling market atmosphere - including, during the day at least, the aroma emanating from the seemingly very popular fish stall that is almost next door to Franco Manca's indoor seating area - adds to the sense of a lively, popular, down to earth establishment. \u00a0Franco Manca is well worth visiting.",

Sour dough bases, simple toppings, simple seasonal salad, astonishing lemonade - honey sweetened - and bills of, generally, under a tenner a head. It's remarkable. On the downside, the opening hours and queues do make it tricky to get there but if they opened longer or expanded, well, it wouldn't be the same, would it? Foibles are good. Foibles are charming. Foibles, in this instance, means they can make more sourdough for tomorrow's pizza bases It's the circle of life.",

I'm a broke college kid so it seemed like one of the more affordable options. I really could not have been happier with my choice!My boyfriend and I both had the pizza with chorizo and pepperoni- turned out being some of the best pizza I have ever tasted. The staff was extremely friendly and fast. (We were there on a Thursday afternoon so it wasn't very crowded.) It's true there is a fish market next door but the food is totally worth braving the smell for. If you have a chance to go I'd also recommend their homemade lemonade too!",

For me, the Margherita is the Litmus Test of any pizza joint. If you can't get that right, you shouldn't be in business. I ordered mine with a glass of the red they had. The only complaint was I would have preferred a few more basil leaves on it. The dough was chewy with charred bits and the sauce and cheese was balanced perfectly. Don't forget to glance at the chalkboard for the specials. Sometimes they have different pizzas that are not on the menu and be ready to share a table if your numbers don't match to the available seating.",

As an American living abroad the last 5 years, I pretty much gave up on finding good pizza in London. \u00a0I don't really relate with people who complain about most food choices in our great city, because you can definitely find a great burger, pasta, etc. \u00a0but pizza has always been a no fly zone - Until Franco Manca. \u00a0I'm originally from NY and my partner is from Chicago so already we have different ideas on what pizza should taste like, but following a trip down to Dulwich to see the Andy Warhol exhibit (another post not necessary to tell you it's not worth it) we took two other American friends to Franco Manca to see if the pizza was worth the rave. It is - and so much more. \u00a0My partner (from Chicago but living in NYC the last 8 years) says you know they know what they're doing when they deliver it to you unsliced and oozing with goodness. \u00a0We ordered across the menu (i would recommend to get a full scope) a couple veggie choices and two of the chorizo based pizzas and spread 'em around the table. You won't be disappointed. Hands down worth the trip if you're in Brixton and even better, it doesn't put a strain on the pockets!",

Also, as the market is closed at night and on Sundays, most people descend on Franco Manca's on a Saturday. As a connoisseur or sour dough, I find the pizza base astoundingly good. You can tell that it has been left to rise for at least day as the dough is so soft and light. I also appreciate the sheer simplicity of the menu - the simple pizzas are made from great ingredients, which you can taste. I am glad they have started to use pitted olives now as I nearly broke a tooth a few months back. If you like gingery lemonade you should try theirs. It is made with strong honey and is quite out of this world. I have never had the house red of white wine, but it looks drinkable. To me Franco Manca is like sitting in Naples.",

A really great pizza for a very reasonable prize - \u00a35.60. What makes this pizza so different is that the base is made out of sour dough (dont know much about sour dough but it tastes good thats all that matters) and you can taste the freshness of the tamotoe sauce base which differs to your pizza express or pizza hut. The decor of the restaurant is very basic, infact it is extrememly basic but the pizza is that good that you would not care as much. Everything sold here is homemade or organic. The drinks list was very simple as well, all they had was beer,homemade lemonade,wine and water -literally. However, I travelled from leicester square to Brixton on my lunch break to try out the pizza sold at Franco Manca and yes it was worth it.

One day when I finally get to Italy this is what I imagine the pizza will taste like. Thin crispy bases, topped with a fresh tomato base, flavoursome mozzarella and rich chorizo, all for a fiver. What a bargain. There isn't much choice. A handful of pizzas to choose from, limited extra toppings and a few standard, unbranded drinks. But that's kinda nice actually. I ordered extra olives at a cost of 90p. Imagine my shock when I got just 2 olives. Normally I would have written it off to bad luck (or an ungenerous chef) but my friend had the same problem. The waiter was clearly ashamed and ran off to tell a manager who quickly brought us a bowl of olves. Well done! The queues - all those gushing reviews mean that when Franco Manca is open you can expect to queue. And queue. They aren't open for dinner in the week so it's lunch only for now. All in a all, a great concept and delicious food make this place a winner. There are a few issues, but I have a feeling those will all be resolved soon.",

    "text": "I've heard many, many things about Franco Manca. Many hail it as the best pizza in London, so off I went to sample it myself. There's a danger of the over-hype, and I was conscious of this - I was fully expecting to be completely blown away. Given that it's in Brixton and they only open from 12 - 5pm, it's not the easiest of places to visit, but I finally did. We settled down at a table outside, in the covered market area. It was cold - coats stayed on for the duration of the meal and my toes froze. The menu is small, and instantly I plumped for the anchovy, caper and olive pizza. It was disappointing that they didn't have the buffalo mozzarella that day but nevertheless, the pizza was indeed, delicious. It had a lovely crust, great flavour and was generous in the toppings. It was a decent size too, something I always look for in a pizza. A well dressed green salad accompanied it.Home-made lemonade was delicious and tasted a bit like honey, but the white wine (at \u00a37.50 a bottle) was pretty grim. I couldn't drink more than half a glass of it and not just because I was hungover - it was really acidic and tasted quite astringent. Verdict? Really impressive pizzas, and extremely well priced considering it's all organic (the bill for 3 pizzas, 1 bottle of wine, 2 large bottles of lemonade and a side salad came to \u00a331). I would definitely come again, but perhaps in the summer - I was seriously frozen by the time our meal was finished; get a table indoors if you can. The waiting staff could do with a prod too - we had to fetch our own glasses, fetch the waitress to get the bill, and then correct the waitress on said bill.",

When I lead my friends and family, one by one, down here they look at me enquisitively with one eye on me the other on the venue..ok ok it doesnt look like anything special at all, decor and shared picnic style benching simple as simple can be but the effort is in the food! The menu simple can be only offering 6 varying pizzas with 2 daily specials, side salad, a choice of house red or white wine, beer, coffee and homemade lemonade. \u00a0I've probably tried them all - best traditional pizza outside of Italy! Mama Mia!",

I was at Franco Manca with two friends of mine and I had an amazing Funghi, fresh vegies, and delicious toppings. On top of that we've got the pizzas served really fast. Staff are really nice and polite and the prices are affordable. What else is there to require? I strongly recommend this place!",

It was very much one of those how-the-hell-have-I-or-anyone-else-I-know-for-that-matter-not-been-here-yet moments.Franco Manca is split in half across the market thoroughfare. It's cramped next to a fish stall, spilling out all over the pavement. If you need space, peace and time on your side, then it's not for you.However, it serves the best pizza I've had this side of the channel, anywhere. It's embarrassingly good. You see the whole production process infront of you (since you're right next to the chef), and out they pop from the wood ovens, straight infront of you. Fresh, hot, doughy joy.There's only 5 or 6 pizzas on the menu, they're all about a fiver each and ten inches across. You can have a salad, an organic beer and an espresso for a pound. It's perfect. Utterly perfect.The queue moves fast. The manager is hilarious. It's the anti-Pizza Express, and I wish it was in central London so I could go more often.Totally essential.",

Service is always great and the staff are all very friendly and work efficiently. The only downside is that quite often there are queues, but I guess that's the price you have to pay for popularity. On the bright side the people, that go there are mostly locals and they are all very interesting and friendly people, so it's a great place to meet the locals.",

Well made crusty doughs with simple but sparse toppings makes for a great lunch. I've eaten various pizzas from aubergine to spicy chorizo. A small green salad balances out the salty and sometimes fattiness of the pizza. \u00a0 Unlike others, I thought the lemonade was vile as I've drunk better in Italy. I would suggest that they bring in San Pellingino range of drinks which are far better. The house red or White is pretty drinkable.",

    "text": "Most first-timers just want to know one thing: Does Franco Manca live up to the hype? (or rave reviews, for the less cynical). Between TimeOut's twitterpated tone and the coos of pleasure from the mag's faithful legions, this Brixton pizza hideaway has developed a reputation for greatness.Franco Manca is a Brixton market hole-in-the-wall serving up smallish pies baked in a visible wood-fired oven. Rumor has it the proprietors slaved for months (or was it years?) to master the perfect sourdough crust. The place is busy, and packed, and impressively efficient. The food menu is sparse but enticing, drinks few but high-quality, prices refreshingly fair. A margherita pizza was 4.90 on my visit.We had the ricotta & sausage and chorizo pizzas, paired with organic beer and a 2 pound glass of house red. And we were impressed. The time dedicated to finding the perfect crust recipe was well spent; I've never eaten a tastier one: thin, slightly sour, massive bubbles galore. And that's important with Franco Manca's pizzas because, as some reviewers complain, toppings are light and somewhat patchy. Plops of pillowy ricotta dotted my pizza; nubs of spicy chorizo sparsely adorned my companion's. Great food aside, the place rings with personality. The manager was everywhere at once, never missing a beat, his presence hovering in that paternal Italian way. Seating is minimal, you might share a table with strangers, and you won't linger too long thanks to the line of hungry patrons waiting for their turn. And there's a post-feast bonus. Once you've paid the (amazingly reasonable) bill, you can saunter a few market stalls down to the small Italian shop, supplier to Franco Manca and owned by the same folks, to pick up some of that fresh ricotta and a slice of homemade polenta cake. Perfetto.",

Make sure you also try the apple juice, it's the real stuff! The atmosphere is truly unique: located in the Brixton markets with seating mainly outside (roofed over), whiffs of grilled fish from the restaurant next door sweeping past and the staff with their constant chatter a definite source of entertainment. There are only two tiny points of criticism: the inevitable (?) waiting in line and once in a while pizzas that come out a bit too blackened. Still, 5 stars it is without doubt.",

The whole daytime only opening hours thing meant I only finally managed to co-ordinate a visit there with my boyfriend a couple of weeks ago but boy was it worth the effort - all the nice things people are saying about it are completely true! You can taste the difference when ingredients are this high quality, and at Franco Manca it goes across every ingredient from the sourdough pizza bases to the organic mozzarella. It's melt-in-your-mouth, please-don't-ever-let-me-finish amazing. That they are not cheekily charging double their current prices makes me love them even more, this lovely down to earth, genuine part of the Brixton community. Brava!",
