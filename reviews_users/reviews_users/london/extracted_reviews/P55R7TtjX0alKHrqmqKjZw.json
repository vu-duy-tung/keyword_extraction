Geales has happily shattered my preconceived thoughts of herring and anchovies as being blech. I had never seen herring and anchovies look so fresh, silvery and appealing before. \u00a0I liked that they were served nearly whole. Tasted very fresh, and accented by a light pickling and great balance of saltiness and acidity. As for the star of the show...the fish and chips were cooked perfectly. The batter was crispy and light. With a nicely chilled bottle of white, made for a delicious meal overall.",

    "text": "Do you know how many attempts it took me to find this place? THREE attempts on THREE different days. I am stubborn and I do not give up easily, I am so glad that I am stubborn. The reason I was so stubborn to come here was yes, the Fish and Chips but it is the oldest Notting Hill chipy. It was first opened Pre-WWII in 1939. Although the look has changed of this chipy, the concept of fresh fish and chips are the same. Maybe why it has been around for 70 years. I needed to come here!This location actually is easy to find after I got lost and figured I would try again.. a couple more times. Plus the third time I decided to go during the daytime, so I could actually see. I used a printed google map because I did not want to use my data and on one occasion I was low on battery when I decided to use my GPS. Notting Hill Geales is tucked away behind modern day buildings on the Main Street of Baywater. There is a little alleyway by the cinema that leads you to an old neighborhood of colorful row houses and Geales! So simple but getting lost has always been a thing for me.I arrived when the place opened so I had the place to myself. I think I came at an odd time because my server was doubling up as the painter for upstairs before the other staff arrived. That didn't matter to me because he was very kind and attentive with the 'Customer first' attitude. The interior was so very sweet, quaint and old with pillows on the backs of the chairs. I took a seat by the window so I could have good lighting for those Yelp pictures. I ordered a Prosecco, the white fish soup and the fish (cod) and chips. Everything came out on a timely manner but I did not feel rushed and I took my time. The Prosecco was crisp and chilled, very nice at past 11:00 AM! The food was excellent! I so loved the white fish soup. Growing up Asian, we would go to relatives or to restaurants and fish soup would be served. I never liked it because of the fishy flavored broth. My mother never made it, thank God! I took the chance and just loved it. The broth did not have a fishy taste, it was creamy and blissful. You could tell it was fish based but it was not overpowering. The white fish was tender and plentiful, plus there were little toasted pieces of toasted bread to dip.Since it is a chipy, I had to go what Geales is known for- Fish and Chips. I chose the most common fish for F & C, cod. I wanted to see how good they did cod. What was brought out was a whopping piece of fish, fried golden over a bed of chips. It was so beautiful served on paper printed like newspaper and a generous serving of tartar sauce. The fish itself was top notch as it was very fresh and tender. The chips were hot and not soggy even with the fish on top. I did take preventative measures and I took the fish off the top while eating it, just in case. Everything was fabulous, darling. Fabulous.This has to be one of my favorite chipies that I have been to throughout the UK and Ireland. For the price, the service, the perfection of the food and the history of the place no wonder it is noted in the book '1,000 Places to See Before You Die.' Now that I found where you were located, you have my love Geales! Cheers!",

    "text": "I find it difficult to write a review for a venue that I'm not that excited about, but I feel that it is my responsibility to inform others that are considering trying it out. Geales is one of those places.Before coming here, I read all of the reviews on Yelp. \u00a0The reviews are pretty mixed, and I wanted to discover for myself how many stars this place really deserves.Geales first opened its doors in 1939. \u00a0My in-laws used to dine here with their parents. \u00a0Given it's longevity, my love of fish & chips, short walking distance from my flat, and the fact I've never been here, I decided to give it a try.It is located in charming Notting Hill. \u00a0The decor is a pleasant mix of contemporary and traditional with dark grey high-gloss walls, hardwood-floors, and white tablecloths. \u00a0Although Geales considers itself to be a classic fish & chips house, it isn't. I believe a fish & chips house should be casual, friendly and low-key. \u00a0This place isn't. The clientele is pretty stuffy, and the host, who was also our waiter had an attitude and was very impatient as he took our order. \u00a0He pretty much demanded that we order a starter and sides even though we weren't that hungry. \u00a0We requested ice water from the very beginning, and were never served it until we asked a food runner towards the end of our meal. \u00a0We all ordered the haddock fish & chips special with a bottle of beer for 16.95 pounds each. \u00a0I asked our waiter if I could have my fish grilled instead of fried since this is an option on the a la carte menu, but he said no. \u00a0I also asked if I could substitute the fries for a vegetable, and was turned down yet again. \u00a0Everything took a long time to arrive. \u00a0While waiting I noticed dark food stains on the bottom of the tablecloth near my lap.The only thing positive I can say about this place is that the haddock fish & chips is massive - - the length of the fried fish is about a foot and a half. \u00a0The sad part is that about a quarter of the fish length and depth is fried batter. \u00a0I've had excellent fish & chips where the golden batter is crisp, tasty and floats in your mouth. \u00a0This batter was doughy, heavy and bland. \u00a0Two of us had to pretty much dissect through the batter to get to the white flesh haddock. The fries were overly salted as well.After completing our entrees, we weren't in the mood to stay for pudding as sadly the overall dining experience wasn't pleasant. \u00a0Even though, this place has been open for over 70 years, I have no desire to return.",

    "text": "Geales serves the absolute BEST fish and chips in the world!!! HANDS DOWN, NO QUESTIONS. I admit that one of the primary reasons for our trip to London was to find the best fish and chips so I was giddy after eating here. Mission accomplished. There are a few different fish options. I would suggest to stick with the cod. We ordered the sole as well which was still delicious, but the cod was much flakier and \"meatier.\" The fry was absolute PERFECTION. A good fish and chips should be light, crisp, and poufy - meaning elevated and separated from the fish. None of this soggy mushy nonsense offered in the States. Geales executed this to the tee. Add some malt vinegar and aoli, take a swig of your London's Pride beer, and this will send you right into food heaven.Geales alone can warrant another trip back to London. A bit on the pricey side for fish and chips but it is an upscale restaurant and the best fish and chips in the world makes it worth every penny.",

We had the chance to soak in the sun and sat in their outside seating. Both of us tried the cod fish and chips. I went with the lunch special which was very reasonably priced. The salad that came with it was much better than I expected in terms of quality of ingredients and size. Fish was fresh and moist and the chips were crispy! Great place!",

The fish pie had plenty of seafood, was kind of hearty and filling, but tasted quite bland. The risotto, on the other hand, was flavorful enough but was presented poorly. Note we were the only patrons for the entire time we were there for lunch, and that's never a good sign. The young dudes running the place were ok-friendly and helpful though, so good luck lads!",

    "text": "Oh my God, what a massive disappointment! A friend in Manhattan, a former Londoner herself, recommended this place for our London holiday. She will be appalled when I tell her our experience. The host (?) seated us in an isolated spot-mind you, the restaurant was dead on a Wednesday evening, which is not a good sign in itself-then left us without menus. We easily sat for 10 minutes waiting for our waiter. At last, the host returned with menus, and was clearly disgusted-disappointed-contemptuous when we did not order drinks. How dare we! Such plebeians. He then took our order-oh wait, he's now our waiter I guess-and was clearly eager to get us out of there. He showed zero pride in the restaurant, zero pride in his job, zero enthusiasm to share the menu with us. We clearly were not the type of people he could suck up to. After ordering, he went away, returned to our vicinity to glance at an empty, still dirty table. For some reason, he yelled to a co-worker who was clearly invisible or in a different part of the restaurant entirely. Why he yelled, I do not know, but clearly this didn't strike him as being the least bit inappropriate. The food came, was decent, but not at all worth the price and inexcusable treatment. Thank heavens my wife saw someone with a carafe of water, and had asked our waiter-host to bring one. He certainly never came back to check if we were happy with our meals or needed anything else. Just an FYI for management, we saw we were being treated badly early on, and decided to eat-drink as little as possible, so as not to waste our money on a bad experience. Leaving the restaurant, we encountered the waiter-host in the front door. I said good evening. He said nothing. (The waiter-host was Lorenzo. We dined on 13 April 2016, receipt number 14460, VAT #778706673) We've had some wonderful and some bad experiences in London so far, but Geales of Notting Hill is setting a terrible example for your city.",

Waitress was very attentive and friendly. We also had their Shepard's pie and it was delicious. The entrees also came with salad and a bread basket. And Geales is also known for their fresh seafood.
