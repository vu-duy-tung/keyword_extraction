    "text": "This pub certainly has character. It's a tiny building tucked around the back of the Royal Courts of Justice, with a comedy resident black cat who, bizarrely, seems usually to be wearing a ruff. The landlady and staff certainly have strong characters - which is a great thing if you manage to strike up a rapport with them, and potentially less of a great thing if you get off on the wrong foot. Our visit went reasonably well, but this may have been due to our possession of perhaps the ultimate ice-breaker: a crochet banana carried by one of the group (it was a Let's all go down the Strand-themed pub crawl, so there were several bunches of bananas being carried). I've not eaten here (we'd had enough bananas to keep us going by this point) so can't comment on the food, but they had a good selection of beers last time I visited. One other factor that stuck in the mind was the toilet - facilities are limited and not that great (one unit upstairs, right next to the kitchen). The stairs up to it are quite steep, so p'raps don't wait until after pint number 5 to go you might see rather more than seven stars if you come a cropper on the way down.",

With a resident cat, Tom Paine, space for 7 tables and a nightmarishly steep staircase to the bathrooms, this pub is quaint in every sense of the word. The landlady is an excellent cook and the pub lunches are definitely worth a try. There is a good selection of ale on tap and ever-friendly staff to keep the service swift. It does get VERY full after work and at lunches, but its worth the squeeze!",

This place is the definition of eccentric, but all the better for it: tiny, a resident cat, film-related decor (from Hollywood's heyday), and wonderful, engaging staff. The fact it's always packed is a good indication of how well regarded it is by punters with plenty of other options a stones-throw away (including the gigantic Knights Templar where it would be much easier to get a seat). As a free-house it's got the huge advantage of being able to sell a range of top quality beers (often from micro-breweries) and not force-feed its customers the usual tied-pub chemical rubbish. Its food is unpretentious, appetising, and excellently priced; its beers also come in at very reasonably cost, and it does well with spirits. If only more pubs could be like this",

There is wooden flooring and the walls are decorated with a mix of old black and white photographs, old ads and posters and some rather bizarre pictures. And there, on the bar counter, sat a big and very distinguished-looking black cat, Mr Tom Paine. (He looked like he might open his little cat mouth and speak at any moment - he reminded me of the talking cat in the Master and Margarita, who's the devil's assistant.) Anyway. They have a pretty good selection of beers, too, so I thought we were on to a winner here. But there are some crucial flaws - the beer is unnecessarily pricey, and the food, which was mediocre at best, is seriously overpriced. I hate it when they try and make the menu sound all posh and trendy, and then when the food arrive you realise you could have done a better job yourself. Oh well. I'd give it five stars for the pub itself, but three or even two for the food.",

A Cat! \u00a0For a moment, we weren't sure if it was real or not, to be honest. \u00a0It was sleeping on a window box and looked a bit like it was on display, in part because it was wearing a little ruff around its neck. \u00a0After we sat down, we saw it's tail flick and we realized it was the real deal. \u00a0We immediately gave it a stroke, which it studiously ignored as a kitty that clearly gets a lot of excited people wanting to give it some loving. \u00a0It was an incredibly well mannered feline...when our food came, it got up, stretched, and sat watching us eat, but never tried to beg for a bit, and eventually wandered off entirely. \u00a0Yay for kitties! \u00a0(Even if it did give me the sneezes...I'm allergic. \u00a0If you are too, keep this in mind before visiting)The ONLY reason why I took a star away from this sweet little pub was because of the stairs up to the toilet. \u00a0My friend had warned me that it was a steep walk up and back, and I thought she was exaggerating...but she was certainly NOT. \u00a0I thought they must be joking when they directed me up the stairs to go to the loo. \u00a0I seriously feared for my life as someone with mobility issues, and dreaded the trip back down again the whole time. \u00a0I managed it, but I did wonder how someone who'd had too much to drink would manage...and of course someone with more mobility issues than myself would never be able to stay here for long. \u00a0It's all part of the character, and I still adore this place, but for marathon drinking sessions, I can't stay here because I'll be too afraid to go up those stairs again. \u00a0Even so, I WILL be back for dinner or a quick drink.",

It might not be the best place for cat allergy sufferers to fraternize after a long day at the office, but if you like a friendly feline with your pint or glass of wine, then you should definitely head over to The Seven Stars. Hidden away behind fleet street, this old little haunt can be easy to miss, but if you do happen to be walking by, you'd certainly notice its quaint charm and wonky exterior (one of the oldest pubs in London i'm told). Roxy, the manager, is a little kooky \u00a0- often sporting strange hair styles and colors \u00a0-- but she's as friendly as they get and is always happy to serve ice cold beers to the throngs of thirsty patrons that visit (just don't diss cats...that'll get you kicked out!). What I love most about this place is the odd mix of clientele..everyone from upper-crust bankers and barristers to toothless wanderers and smelly students can be found in here...it's this eclectic crowd which gives it such a lovely vibe. And don't forget to check out the resident cat during your visit. The friendly moggy can often be found passed out in an arm chair or flirting with patrons whilst wearing an Elizabethan-style collar -- no, i'm not kidding. All in all, if you're in central and fancy a fuss-free (but not necessarily fur free drink), stop by The Seven Stars and relish in all its quirky splendor!",

This tiny, ancient pub from ye olde days certainly did not disappoint. The seating area is certainly very cosy and our party took up a significant portion of the space. There was a varied selection of lagers and ales at the bar and the service fairly quick. The pheasant was quite nicely done and the mushroom preparation looked quite appetising too. The place has character, perhaps best appreciated when tottering up a very narrow staircase to get to the toilets.

A little glass display case has a selection of intriguing objects, including the two cats feedhere.posterous.com . This pub is a gem, tucked away behind the Royal Courts of Justice. It's very popular and has a local feel about it. Stylish checked green and white oilcloths adorn the tables, and the pub has a warm welcoming feel. You could be mistaken for thinking your in a small country pub in France at times. That may be a little too much considering the occasional banter between the barrister types. Seats are hard to come by but if you can snaffle one it's a bonus. Good ale is served a broadside and Adnams satisfied the ale aficionados amongst us. They also have guest ales and also a good list of wines by the glass. It was the food that really intrigued. Little food gems that reflect a warm promise of spring don't punctuate every visit to the pub. This was strictly a drinking visit but thankfully a friend ordered some food at the bar. Cured herring with potato salad was great utilising simple strong flavours. The fish was served ceviche style. Roxy Beaujolais is the landlady so the good food shouldn't really of come as a surprise.

And our fellow diners looked pretty satisfied too--that cheeseburger was enormous!",

Mostly filled with barristers and solicitors during the week, it has a charming wood-panelled vibe that feels authentic, and unforced. Various old movie posters are scattered on the walls, for when this pub was used as a backdrop for various films from the 30s, 40s, and 50s. Good selection of ales on tap, and you'll get a decent GT, but don't expect modern fancy bar service. My favorite pub in the area. Be nice to Tom Paine the Cat!",

It's funky and idiosyncratic and dusty in the corners and I wouldn't have it any other way. And yes ... the cat. He's real. I've been here several times on trips to London over a span of 25 years, most recently this month. It hasn't changed one iota and thank the gods for that. If you come on a weekday it will be packed with lawyers, on a weekend you will be one of only a few patrons...choose your experience. Sometimes the staff is brusque when the place is busy but they have always treated me well at off hours, and I'm an annoying American. The food is traditional and consistently good with a changing menu. Sometimes it rises to the level of truly exceptional if you order the right thing on the right day. If you want something modern and gleaming, go elsewhere ... and don't bother going to Europe at all, just stay in Indiana. I adore pubs, they are to my mind the best thing about the UK, and this is my all time favorite. The real &$%@# thing.",

Seven Stars has a few seating areas surrounding the bar but isn't especially large. The two single bathrooms are upstairs; you'll have to brave the teeny staircase. It was the late afternoon/early evening, so Seven Stars wasn't very crowded. We both ordered the lamb meatballs and penne which was richer and more filling than we'd expected, perhaps a tiny bit oily. I forgot the exact price, but it was around \u00a311. Very satisfying after a lot of walking around the city.I'm glad I was able to check out this old pub, which according to Wikipedia, dates back to the 1600s!",

That said, they've given room behind the counter to a good number of real ales from both larger and smaller breweries. You can also get wine by the glass here.A few tables covered with green and white checked cloths can be found in the room to the side; it makes that area resemble a bit of a greasy spoon 'caff' if I'm honest, but otherwise I loved the place immensely.

    "text": "Greeted by a friendly cat (but aloof, of course, it is a cat after all) in a ruff, I immediately fell in love with this quintessential British pub. The space is rather cozy, meaning small, so coming in a large group of 6-8 people meant standing around in typical British pub fashion for a great while before we could find tables to accommodate us. No upstairs. We went about 3PM on a Saturday and it stayed crowded until about 5, when it mysteriously emptied out for the next hour. Peak traffic and noise around 4PM. Pint of Aspall cider for 4 pounds-ish, if I remember correctly. Ended up ordering the paprika chicken dish for dinner and it was yummy (not spicy or even with \"the heat of spice\" per se as advertised to me) but flavorful and filling. Comes with a great bitter slaw and rice. Looked more diversified than my friend's dish, the goose breast, which was a ton of meat in squares around a giant dollop of mashed potatoes with a hunk of purple cabbage, as well. Dishes seemed to range in price from 9.5 - 12.5 pounds. Looks like they had sausage/mash, mutton or chicken stew, and a whole host of other classic pub dishes. Since it's right behind LSE (I always end up on Carey Street when trying to find Lincoln's Inn Fields anyways; terrible sense of direction), I'll definitely be coming back for me.",

You go inside, and there are tables. And there's a cat. That wears a Jacobean ruff (as others have mentioned). It's freaking incredible. The staff is really sweet, as they didn't seem annoyed at all when we were the last ones to leave at closing time. If you're looking for lager, you're not going to be spoiled for choice. But there are plenty of ales available if that's your thing. I haven't tried the food and there were conflicting reports from our table. One person said their food is really good, while another said it was good but that he got sick after eating it. I'm going to go ahead and rule it safe since my husband eats there often with colleagues and he's still alive.",

It's not a very big pub and the resident cat roams around freely, but if you love cats (or at least don't mind them) then do go to Seven Stars for a meal, or at least a pint. The cat may seem like a gimmick, but actually the venue is fantastic for lunch. It serves hearty pub grub - good value and big portion. Most importantly, the ingredients are tasty. At my last visit, I had the Italian sausage and mash with red cabbage. They are the most plump (plumpest!) and tastiest sausages I've had ever. The pub isn't fancy, it's a bit cramped, but staff is friendly (especially if you are friendly with the cat) and it's quiet - perfect place for a catch up.",

Kudos to the staff for coming up with such a great idea - to let a cat freely into the pub and the lovable thing would melt your heart if it happens to come by your table. Apart from you host, sir Tom, the food offered are quite the traditional pub offerings, all of them being really delicious and nicely presented. There's also a nice range of ales at the bar so you can drink up freely.",
