Architecturally convoluted (but with space outside in good weather), it always seems full, yet a table can be magically produced from a dark corner and you will soon be delighted by the familiar and perfectly-executed dishes and well-chosen and reasonable wines. This was the first restaurant address I gave my daughter when she became old enough to be taken out by boys who might be unsure where to go, and they were delighted, as it's one of those rare places where the bill always seems to be smaller then you expect, and the atmosphere authentic and fun.",

I go there for business lunches in Mayfair or family and friends lunches or dinners when we absolutely want to eat outside. They have a great terrasse in Shepperds Market, a pedestrian area with lots of charm and history. Prices have increased recently and it was more expensive than what I remembered when we went there recently but the food was really good and the service typically French (do not translate by rude just nice, smiling and attentive, I guess none of them must be from Paris). the menu offers lost of options in terms of meat, poultry and fish as well as many classic French starters, including mussels.

We were greeted very nicely and served fizz so we could mingle & chat before being seated. We had a Mersault and a lesser Burgundy from their list with our meal and both were above average. After we sat and during ordering we were served excellent 'French' bread that was freshly made, if a little heavy. There was a slight delay in getting the starter to table but thereafter all flowed in a timely manner and our waitress was attentive throughout. I had Beef Carpaccio followed by pan roasted Chicken. The starter portions were too large in my opinion & others. They were however good eating all agreed, though I found my beef a little bland. The follow on dish had moments of above average flavouring and was correctly cooked. Thanks to stuffing myself with the bread & starter I wilted a little, but finished most of my dish. The vegetarian risotto alternative was good & flavourful, though after a few mouthfulls you realised it was over salted, and again too generous and so did not get finished by those who chose it. I chose the Tart Tatin to finish, and though flavourful it was a little too caramelised and the icecream accompanyment was much needed. The cost was \u00a365 a head. I would go again if in the area and it was appropriate, but there is huge competition closeby!",

    "text": "Excellent food, including a sublime wild mushroom risotto, but absolutely horrible service. Not just lazy and incompetent service (although it was that), but also crooked.For instance, the waitress took our bottle of water while it was nearly a third full. I thought she was simply taking it to make room on the table but she immediately returned with a new bottle. Needless to say we didn't need a second bottle, but I would have been more than happy to finish the first bottle (especially since we paid for the whole thing).They charged us \u00a31.50 for each slice of bread in the basket. Before other Yelpers take me to task, I am well aware that in Europe one is charged for bread, even by the slice in many cases. But \u00a31.50 per slice for a baguette? To add insult, the check at the neighboring table appeared to charge \u00a31.50 per person for bread (and they ate their basket) so I can only surmise that they simply chose to \"cheat the American\". Finally, after I paid the check (and even left a relatively generous 15% Tip), the staff chose to begin sharing their impressions of \"idiots who they wish they didn't have to serve\" in French, presumably assuming that as an American I didn't speak any French. In any case I strongly recommend that any one with even a modicum of self respect give the staff their wish of having no customers, and avoid \"Le Boudin Blanc\".",

I had never been before but it was a favourite of my companions - so when it came to ordering I let myself be guided by them and ordered exactly the same as they did- snails and rib eye steak. This is the second time I've had snails now and my opinion so far is that by themselves they are not much to get excited about. It seems to me that basically they are an accompaniment to add some texture to the garlic butter. Is that fair? I suppose the snails are needed as I felt less guilty eating the garlic butter with the snails than I did about just eating the excess from my bowl with a spoon. I'd been told that the steak was going to be the best steak I had ever had. It was very nice but it wasn't, Gaucho and Hawksmoor steaks are better. The steak here had great flavour but it didn't have the amazing texture the best rib eye steaks have. We had a nice big bowl of spinanch on the side. We had 2 bottles of a pinot noir which was brilliant but about twice the price of the types of wines I would normally choose. You get what you pay for though, it was almost the best wine I'd ever had",

    "text": "Was looking for a place to grab a late dinner after arriving on the day flight from NY. \u00a0It was a choice between Le Boudin Blanc and the Lebanese joint across the street. \u00a0After walking back and forth between the menus a few times, i decided that I should go for the French food, since reasonably priced French food is not so common in NY.It turned out to be a good choice. \u00a0(Especially since the business dinner I had the following night with a group turned out to be at the Lebanese joint). \u00a0I will start with the highlights and work my way back.The highlight was the Boudin Blanc. \u00a0I figured, if the restaurant can make anything great, it had better be the dish it is named after. \u00a0Turns out that Boudin Blanc is a fitting name. \u00a0The Boudin Blanc was a delicious soft pillowy sausage that was deliciously paired with sauteed mushrooms and the best mashed potatoes I have ever had. \u00a0I would go back, if only for the potatoes.The onion soup was very good. \u00a0It was beefy and cheesy, everything you look for in french onion soup.Less fantastic were the escargot. \u00a0The snails were very small and the oil mix could have used some more salt. \u00a0Further, the bread that was served was not the best bread for sponging up the garlicky goodness that is escargot - although in view of the average taste, it was probably a good thing.A couple of Kronenborg's and dinner was definitely satisfying. \u00a0Also, kudos to my waitress. \u00a0I was planning to get the duck confit, but the waitress told me that it was not the best she has had, and that it tended to be dry.",

    "text": "For photos see Greedy Diva @ greedydiva.blogspot.com/\u2026  I've always wanted to eat in that cute little pocket of Mayfair that is Shepherds Market. There's a hubbub of pubs and bistros and arty looking boutiques, and it's perfectly positioned near the Curzon Mayfair for a drink or a bite before a movie. It's one of those places I often walk past on my way to somewhere else, thinking \"I must come back here\" and then I promptly forget all about it. And then the lovely R popped the question to my amazing friend A, A said \"yes\", and there was serious champagne to be drunk. They chose Le Boudin Blanc, a favourite little restaurant of theirs in the heart of Shepherds Market, which promised to provide a touch of Paris in London - with ex-Le Gavroche head chef, Nicolas Laridan, at the stove to boot. Yes please. Le Boudin Blanc is all very cosy and romantic inside. The downstairs room is probably the most atmospheric, but there are 2 rooms upstairs, looking down onto the surrounding laneways, with wooden tables, candlelight and stone floors. It's warm and wintry and quaint. The place has character. And its nice to be spoken to in French for a bit - even if you don't know what it means, it sounds good and you can pretend you are Audrey Tatou. They see the way to my heart early on - I agree to switch tables before my friends have arrived and am rewarded with a bubbly kir royale. Magnifique. From a classic selection of starters like moules marinieres, escargots and duck egg with Morteau sausage, I choose the excellent salmon tartar (\u00a38.50) with lemon oil, dill, white radish and a mustard mayonnaise - it's silky and GORGEOUS. TPG's fish soup (\u00a36.10) is cheesy and lusciously rich - another hit. Perhaps owing to the enthusiastic consumption of champagne up to this point, I can't remember what the other starters were, but I do recall the general sentiment of approval and that the boys were talking about Star Wars. Or Return of the Jedi. Or one of those other crap movies that all boys like. A big, fleshy Dover sole meuniere (\u00a320.50) is swimming in butter, although beautifully moist, and it's the most filling thing I've eaten in a while. The 10 oz rib eye steaks (\u00a319.50) are big and juicy, although TPG's looks like its more fat than meat, which loses points, but the flavour and execution is otherwise good. So full are we, that TPG and I share (share!) the scrummy tart tatin with vanilla ice cream - a little sloppy, but by now, so are we. If you don't have the time or the budget to whisk your beloved off to Paris for the weekend, take him/her for a candlit meal at Le Boudin Blanc. It's rustic and informal, but with just the right amount of French finesse and champagne to make you feel like you're sitting in a bistro in the Marais watching the sun set over the corner patisserie. Expect to pay about \u00a335-\u00a340 per head for 3 courses, plus wine and service.",

So I would recommend that. The fish dishes were more debatable.

As far as prices go, this is a very reasonable French restaurant in one of the cutest of areas (just off of Piccadilly before Green Park). \u00a0With a starter, a main and a glass of wine, the cost is roughly 30-35 quids per person.",

    "text": "Boudin Blanc is a shrine to the French bistro as the English imagine it to be \u00a0all dark wood, big plates and hearty cooking. There's no fancy fusion or haut cuisine. From poached fish in butter and cream sauce to snails by the dozen, it's bistro classics all the way. But just because it's not full of surprises, that doesn't meant it's not good. The food here is classic, sure, but it's classically goodwell, classically great actually. Braised leek & dandelion salad and vegetable soup starters were perfectly done. Surprisingly bold and forceful, there was no wilting in terms of flavour or texture - they were packed full of both. Mains of poached haddock and a chicken linguine were bistro cooking at its best. The fish was gently smoked, firm, flaky and toothsome. The sauce creamy without being too rich. Chicken was deliciously chickeny, moist and tasty breast meat complemented by a gentle paprika cream sauce that clung to al dente linguine. We finished off with Ile Flotant \u00a0a semi set meringue floating in a sea of vanilla custard. The eggy island was good, but the ocean of vanilla was even better. A great end to the meal. Boudin Blanc's chefs cook with a mixture of simplicity and finesse, something deceptively hard to achieve. Everything was cooked to perfection, but not messed around with too much. There is a caveat however: if you're vegetarian, phone ahead because the menu makes no allowances for you. We ended up paying a la carte prices for what we thought was a veggie substitution for the set menu main course. A nasty little surprise that was sprung after we had eaten our food, and something that was absiolutely not made clear beforehand. And no apology for any mix up which would have smooothed ruffled feathers. To be fair, on a previous occasion we had rung ahead and they had been really good about it, fixing something special, which was partly why we had come back. If it weren't for this, and the fact the food is so well cooked, I'd think twice before returning. But the food really is good \u00a0it reminds me of Galvin Bistro do Luxe. And so I will most likely give it a chance to wipe away the bad memories.",

    "text": "Last weekend we were in London to celebrate a brithday and had reserved a table in Maze by Gordon Ramsey. Finally, however, the weather was so lovely that we just really did not want to spend the evening in a cramped, up tight environment and decided to randomly find a restaurant with terrasse. And we found Le Boudin Blanc! Although we did get a short-notice reservation we had to wait for our table in the outside area in front of the restaurant. This did not bother at all, however, as it allowed us to discover the very charmig area and check out the other restaurants in the vicinity. Finally we were greeted and seated. The menu is rather small and concise including all the French classics like fois gras and snails. We chose to have a fish soup (very tasty, especially the mustard seved with it) and the special, a salmon tartar with melon soup (absolutely amazing) for starters. As main course we chose an Entrecote and a veal steak which were both lovely, especially my veal and including the sides.Sadly it took the sommelier quite a while to join us for recommendations, but his choice was perfect and fit very well in our budget!The fact that all the staff is French (and celebrate their French accent) jsut makes the whole experience even better!",

    "text": "A cute French dinner spot across the street from a bunch of Lebanese and Persian restaurants. \u00a0It's a bit tiny inside - low ceilings, narrow walkways, and maybe three stories high. \u00a0Kitchen and dish washing on the top floor, hidden from the public. \u00a0Daily specials written in French on chalkboards but menus fortunately have English too. \u00a0Waitstaff were also French and very efficient with their service.Our group of six ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir and Merlot, which went well with half the group ordering meat and the other fish. \u00a0Both went down smooth and had little aftertaste.Shared appetizers include snails (a dozen for the table) with strong garlic and a green (pesto?) butter sauce, amazing mussels in garlic wine sauce, and a bit of grilled yellowfin with quinoa. \u00a0My favorites were the mussels by far. \u00a0Their free bread was pretty amazing too by the way - firm outside and chewy inside.For my own starter I ordered the fish soup, which reminded me of bisque. \u00a0Very savory and hearty - must be the broth. \u00a0The shredded cheese melted quickly and added more richness. \u00a0Bread slices came with this yellow sauce that looked like mustard but tasted like roasted garlic - divine.For entree, I ordered the duck confit, which arrived in a cute little cast iron pot. \u00a0It was cooked in beans and pork sausage - a cassoulet. \u00a0Duck meat had wonderful charred skin and the meat was well seasoned, enhanced by the sweet sauce they offered on the side. \u00a0Beans were a bit too much so I finished maybe half only.Desert was chocolate fondant with praline ice cream. \u00a0It's similar to a lava cake, but based on a flour less shell filled with hot fudge that oozed out when cut open. \u00a0Very rich and decadent - having a side of black coffee is a must. \u00a0Overall a nice, reasonably price French place in London that I would highly recommend. \u00a0I haven't been to France yet but could sense they are probably authentic. \u00a0One of our group members don't eat pork products so the wait staff will not make substitutions as it would alter the main dishes. Luckily they have nice beef options without pork too.",

Nonetheless, the hostess was kind and we were still quickly seated. We did not feel rushed during our meal. A server was very helpful in wine recommendations - there's an extensive list! We started with the grilled yellowfin tuna appetizer, served with quinoa and some greens in a light soy dressing. It was delicious and my friend said she wished she could have ordered it as her entree. Instead she ordered the mushroom-stuffed chicken with vegetables, which she said was also really well cooked - and she is a picky eater. I got the duck confit because it felt fittingly French. I was a little nervous about the raspberry vinegar jus and it would be overly sweet like some duck dishes. To my pleasant surprise, it was a very balanced flavor, and the duck was cooked beautifully. It was not dry or tough at all. We were a little full for dessert, but they looked and smelled amazing. I'm glad we found this quaint little restaurant by chance!",

Only problem is smokers are outside as well. A tiny street, but really a wide side walk as no cars come down the side with tables. There is a Lebanese restaurant right across the walk way and some club across the street. There are always Lamborghini or Ferrari or Rolls Royce pulling up and fancy dressed people popping out.The wait time outside is long and inside always looks crowded. Surprising they have beer despite the large wine list. Ordered yellowtail risotto as a starter. The asparagus added a nice touch of crunchiness. Then came the sausage with pistachios and mashed potatoes. Nice. Others ordered the crab, onion soup, sole, and chicken and everyone thought the meal was good. Not great, but good.

    "text": "Before I had a chance to write my review after my first visit, I was there a second time (not by choice). So I'll give you double the feedback here!First visit: This restaurant was recommended by concierge at 45 Park Lane. We wanted something not terribly expensive, nearby, and good. It was 8 pm on a weeknight and the restaurant only had a few tables. Mostly out-of-towners on business. They were only seating on the group level. For our party of two, although there were several other tables open by the windows, they sat us directly next to a man dining by himself. Or should I say, someone who had dined and was now on his mobile phone chatting with a newspaper in front of him. We should have asked to be moved but did not. Instead, we felt like our private meal had an uninvited third guest. Very stupid way to seat patrons.The food was ok.Drinks were also ok. All in all, just ok and fortunately the price was reasonable(ish), especially for Mayfair. We were entertained by the businessman at a table near us with his paid-entertainment for the evening. So obvious bro. So obvious. After that visit, I didn't really have any desire to come back.Cue the second visit. Americans were in town and a client of one of them highly recommended Le Boudin. Really? Out of thousands of restos in London, she recommends one I've been to and didn't care much for? I begrudgingly made the booking for 7:30 on a Thursday.Immediately, things were different. The ground floor was packed and I was brought upstairs. Gasp - there is an entire other level with a large back room too! My french onion soup was very good. I know some people expect this as a 'given' at french restaurants. Well I don't and they deserve credit for it. I had previously ordered the lamb shank (ok enough, lacking much flavor) but went with the Steak Tartare this time. It wasn't bad, but I should have ordered it as my starter rather than a main. Too much raw meat for me. Note, when they ask if you want bread and butter, and you say yes, they will charge you for it.I did eat some of a companions' rib eye. Now that was solid.The apple tart tatin was delightful.The service was five star. We felt tended to. Checked in on. And the etiquette, trained very well. You could see they were taught never to reach over a patron and would go around the table to bring something. I haven't seen such classic and well-trained service in such a long time. Really stand out.Here we go with two vastly different experiences. One, easily forgettable with no hint of well trained servers or a kitchen above mediocre. A second visit with long-lost and much missed excellent service and much more flavorful food.I don't know if you'll get Jekyll or Hyde. But if someone asked me to dine there again, I'd say yes.",

Now it has the best entrec\u00f4te de b\u0153uf \u00a0au poivre in town, and with a decent bottle of wine, contentment and conviviality are yours.",

    "text": "The Shepherd Market area of Mayfair has many fine, casual restaurants and this is definitely one of them. The food was perfect and service on point. Good selections and reasonable prices for wine by the glass. Better food than we had in Paris in neighborhood cafes. I would suggest a reservation, but we were able to walk in at 6:30 to a very crowded place. One or the other of us had each course and all were excellent. The only reason I did not rate this one notch higher is that it is very noisy with tight seating. We were off to the side but table conversation was still a challenge. High recommended.",
