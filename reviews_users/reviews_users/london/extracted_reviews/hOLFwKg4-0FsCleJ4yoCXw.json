Amazing taste, mixed with cheese and mushrooms. The sourdough bread, aka the soldiers, are the perfect idea for dipping. Crispy, tasty, two word to define this experience.Then, I chose to go for the Belgian Waffle. It was like a firework in my mouth. To good to be eaten only one time!! Loved the way they prepared the banana, sliced and topped with a thin layer of glazed caramel :D (I still think about this)At the 40th floor, this is heaven!The view is impressive, but a reservation is required in order to enjoy this amazing space.Service is perfect.Great for a business meeting or your lover.",

So much for making themselves so exclusiveThankfully, that was all the bad things abt duck & waffle.The service was attentive and polite the entire time. Our food was deliciousBeef carpaccio with foie gras : light, flavorful, foie gras was creamy goodnessDeviled duck egg: not the best I've hadSmoked chili pork cheeks on polenta: rustic, rich, flavorful Duck & waffle: fried duck confit was yummy, waffle drizzled with mustard maple syrup was great and the fried egg was a nice touch.Gnocchi with deep fried soft boil egg: sleeper surprise of the night. We wanted to lick the plateThe views were great. Stop by the terrace bar downstairs for a drink or 2 before heading off. Great for a night out esp with visitors",

Anyone going for the first time will no doubt be impressed by views, food and service. Only slight problem was the girl on the next table didn't want her duck egg with her waffle (which tasted amazing) and my boyfriend nearly leaned over and asked if he could have it!

Or in this case London.As I enter the heron tower into what seems to be a secluded sort of hallway where we were approached by a gentleman with secret service type earpiece asking us for how many?!.. I then relax from my alert instinct and enjoy the elevator top all the way to the top to Duck & Waffle!As I walk into the place I noticed the sky high scenery as the place overlooked almost all of London a really good way to start I might say. I order the duck & waffle obviously and fell in love!! The crispy yet luscious and salty duck pair so well with the delicious syrupy waffle. I think I might even go as far to saying that it might be better than chicken and waffles. So close! To sum it all up this place a cool, chic and very current and when you have those 3 C's in a restaurant it is very hard to fail and it's open till 3am I believe!! What more can you ask for!! As a Californian,I definitely look forward to coming back next time I'm In London!! Cheers!!",

Sounds really gross but they just take like scratchings and come in a brown paper bag. The cocktails come in cool tin cans too! The signature dish is the duck and waffle and it's like nothing you've ever tasted! Sweet honey maple sauce, duck, egg and Belgian waffle. Sounds weird but trust me, it definitely works!

Not worth it just so you can say you went. PS- I love a good open kitchen but the expediter/chef had giant gnarly burns on the backs of his arms - clearly from backing into hot oven doors or corners.

If you actually make it into the dining room (they're open 24 hours, but apparently have some funky times where they temporarily close and communicate poorly about this to folks waiting) you're going to have to wait an hour plus and not ever have true clarity to when you'll be admitted. \u00a0The food sounds fancy, but really isn't top shelf considering their stature. Unique pairings and formats for each dish, but really didn't land for any of us. Service was unhelpful in explaining ingredients or size of each dish which surprised. Generally, this is overhyped if you're looking for anything more than a vantage point for drinks. I hear that it's neighbor sushi samba is far better, but you'll need a reservation. \u00a0Good luck...",

    "text": "Amazing view needless to say! Having that view while you are sitting there with good company and very fine wine automatically heightens your mood. Oh, and food was good, too! Had the tuna, grilled octopus, polenta, and smoked mackerel as starters! Octopus, a little too salty for my taste. Everything else very good and fresh! We then had Sea bass for 2! Cooked to perfection! The service started out spotty but the sommelier and the server that took care of us for the remainder of the evening made up for this one individual that was not very good for the service industry. Went there at 1430 after calling in advance to secure a table. I decided to wing it after reading reviews that people had to make a reservation two months in advance. I got lucky and I found myself even luckier having snagged a table right along the window enabling us to take in panoramic views of London. Quite breathtaking. Elevator ride up was a blast, too! Glass elevator ride all the way up to 40th floor. Call it the combination of experiences, call it the view, but it was worth it. It may seem like a touristy thing to do. We are from NYC and still have not managed to catch dinner at the Freedom Tower because that's not what you do when you are from the city but being in other cities as a tourist is fair game!",

    "text": "The Duck & Waffle surpassed all my expectations. Although to be honest, I really didn't have any. A friend of mine who lives in London brought me here for a late night dinner. This place has a dress code so it is important to dress the part. No sandals, regardless of how sophisticated or in my case \"classy sexy\" your outfit. They almost did not let me in due to this, but a flash of a smile and a pleading please seemed to do the trick. The restaurant is located on the 40th floor of the Heron tower. The elevator is all glass, making for outstanding views and a fast thrilling ride up. The restaurant is posh and trendy with mood lighting and lots of chandeliers. The venue is large and the walls are all glass, allowing you to feast, talk, ponder while enjoying exceptional views of the city. The drinks were fun. We started with champagne and then moved on to their specialty cocktails. All their cocktails are made from vegetables making them fun and slightly healthier than your average libation. I ordered the Heritage Cocktail which consisted of patron, carrot juice and honey. My friend ordered the Pina-Kale-Lada, which consisted of rum, pineapple sherbet and kale. Was it good, you ask? Kale Yeah it was!For dinner we ordered 4 small plates. I was pretty resistant to the ox cheeks, however I gave in and I'm so glad I did. The OX CHEEK GRILLED CHEESE was PHENOMENAL. This is a bold statement, but it very well could have been the best thing I ate during my recent 2 weeks in Europe. I highly recommend it. We also ordered the MAPLE GLAZED CORNBREAD which was DELICIOUS. We could not eat at the Duck & Waffle without ordering the DUCK & WAFFLE which was also great, however if it was my restaurant I would name it \"The Ox Cheek Grilled Cheese\". Lastly we ordered the vegetable plate for good measure. By this time we were really full and this wasn't anything special. I am a firm believer that vegetables can be the most delicious item on a menu, as long as they are seasoned well. This dish could use a little work. Service was okay. We had to chase down the waiter on one occasion and he forgot our champagne. But he was not rude and we were provided with all our desires. Overall this was an incredible dining experience. The views, the ambiance, the drinks and the food were all exceptional.",

Atmosphere was very cool and laid back. Night life amazing. Hennessy XO shot was expensive $60 USD (if I remember correctly). But this place was well worth it. A must stop by and check out if your in the area. Also to add restaurant is on 40+ floor amazing view of London during the day and at night!!!!! Amazing 5 stars for sure.",

    "text": "-SETTLE IN-Oh man... dude, I HAVE yelp because I'm entertained by the reviews and they're sometimes helpful in decision making but I've never actually written a review myself. I honestly feel like it's a bunch of adults telling on each other.. But this place was exceptionally horrid I actually had to write about it. I'm doing this to help you! You know, for the greater good. Like there were so many things wrong with our experience. I can't even believe that this place has any good reviews. SERIOUSLY. We would have gotten more satisfaction literally just giving away 75 quid to a homeless person. No joke!So we're on vacation here and we're night owls so it's like well into the night and we're hungry so we look up 24 hr food and this place pops up. It was kinda down the street, so we walk over not knowing there's a dress code. So the doorman tells us if we'd like to go change and come back we can. And we did. But he first upon greeting us, asked if we had a reservation. Mind you it's 3am. And he's the door guy.. like you know if there's a reservation. You'd have a list, being the doorman and all. Anyway fast forward to our second arrival. We changed and came back. He sees us walk up comes out and tells us \"let me ask for a table\" and goes in and leaves us in the rain. RUDE. AF! Anyhow we go up and the guy that was walking us in stops before seating us and tells us there is a requirement of one entree per person and asks if that's ok like we can't afford it. (Profiling ass) So we blow his mind and let him know that's ok. And he follows up with \"are you sure?\" Like are you kidding me?! And already right there, if you're telling people what they're required to order, you're already not as fancy as you're trying to be. You're strip club status.. \"two drink minimum\" hahaSo he seats us. And tells us the table is set for 1 hour and only food.. even tho there IS a late night cocktail menu, tho I'm not sure what time that ends at. But then proceeds to tell us they're cleaning so basically we just need to put up with the noise and all that comes with. So while we're sitting there, (literally the only patrons in there, so I'm not sure why the doorman couldn't just be cool about the dress code like we needed to impress the chef or something. and why he had to ask for a table like it was so jam packed) they're cleaning like he said but seriously it was just rude. They mopped quite literally at our feet with horribly smelly mop water. and were pulling out tables and chairs of immediate surrounding spots and spraying their cleaning solution in our vicinity. It was all just incredibly rude. Again, not keeping up with the fancy demeanor you're trying to uphold. Our waiter was a douche bag. I'm not even gonna get into the trouble we had whilst trying to order with him. But I will say that when he was clearing our plates before dessert, he was going to wipe down the table and literally touched my arm with his nasty wet rag. Like I'm sorry but I can't even move fast enough before you're in my personal space basically cleaning the table crumbs into my lap?! Also incredibly rude. So we get our dessert which was the caramelized banana waffle or whatever it was and really the whole reason we went was for waffles. But were forced to order some other crap before we could even get waffles. And 1) it comes out as a half of a waffle. A HALF OF A F-ing Waffle. So disappointing. And 2) they had the audacity to serve us some crusty ass, stale, not even exaggerating when I say like 3 or 4 day old waffle HALF. Like really bro?! Waffle is in your name? You couldn't even come correct with a fresh waffle half?! Was it going to interrupt all of the hooting and hollering the cooks were doing in the open facing kitchen. Which AGAIN, is so not classy for your \"fine dining establishment.\" (More like a 'fine diner' and even that, is a compliment) This place is a major joke. And so over priced. Their sad excuse for a waffle.. (the half I was talking about earlier) is the same price range as their trash, main dish menu. GET A GRIP, Duck and Waffle!! I would never, NEVER EVER go back. The view couldn't even drag me back. And it's a pretty nice view. It's about ALL they have going for them. Overall, pretty horrifying experience. I gave up sleep to go there. Easily the most regrettable decision we've made on this trip. If I could give this place zero or negative stars, TRUST.. I would. *drops mic*",

Thought about ordering the beef cheek, but opted for the crispy roast duck. It was delicious, while the waffle was pretty standard. Their unique syrup with mustard seeds was a nice touch. Food was really good, and the service was excellent. Finished with a Filthy Martini at the bar to further enjoy the view. The French bartender was welcoming, informative, and an all around great fellow who greatly enhanced our experience. Cheers, mate!",

We tried 2 weeks in advance for brunch and we couldn't get any times for any of the 3 days we had.You first take a swift trip up 40 floors on an elevator, emptying you into the impressive bar area of the restaurant. The restaurant has a very hip vibe - from lighting to music to the open kitchen.All items can be shared. We got the following:- Rosemary garlic bread: super fresh bread, great flavors from the rosemary and roasted garlic. Comes hot.- Spicy ox cheek donut: sweet and savory, this could be a meal in itself. Much bigger than we expected, meat well-stewed. - Foie gras creme brulee: my fave item on the menu. It has a burnt sugar coating and the Foie gras itself is delicious. It comes with a bread, but I liked it on the rosemary garlic bread - I could taste the Foie gras better.- Broccoli sprouts: don't overlook these! Surprisingly extremely good, comes with a duck egg. Spill the egg over the veggie, so good..and you get a veggie in!- Bone-in ribeye: skip. This is the one item I didn't like at all from the menu. Very basic, and didn't like how sweet the meat is.- Duck & waffle: of course had to try the signature dish. \u00a0The duck confit was cooked to perfection. Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, with a duck egg on top The waffle was like any other waffle, and the mustard syrup was just ok. Still get it for the duck though!We were seated by the window on the Gherkin/Tower Bridge side. View is amazing..really raises the bar on the meal itself.",

If you want to get in at a decent hour, I highly recommend making reservations. I made mine a week out and I was still scheduled for 1:30am. Since it was within the first couple of days coming from the States, 1:30am suited us fine.So where's the pomp? You'll find it before you even get into the building. Velvet ropes and a guy checking your reservations. After we pass muster, we're allowed to enter the glass corner-of-the building elevator. What a beautiful ride. You can see Russia from here! ;)Walking into the restaurant, I first heard the unmistakable sounds of untz-untz-untzing. Did we walk into a club? Then I realized you walk through their bar to get to the restaurant. We were sat right by the window (40th floor) with the best view in the house. Menus with reasonable prices were placed in our hands and we both decided to have the duck and waffle (!) but we were so hungry, he ordered the pig ears for himself (served in a brown bag with a wax seal) and I ordered the Foie Gras Creme brulee served with brioche. Be still my cholesterol-laden heart.My guy wasn't into the pig ears, but they were okay he said. I did like the generous serving of foie (a bit sweet for me). The duck confit, duck egg, and waffle was everything I wanted it to be. Served with a mustard seed maple syrup, it was the perfect...circumstance. The confit was crisp on the outside and buttery on the inside. I already miss it.To add to the whole experience, from the time that we were seated until we left, we received extraordinary service. This should be on your to-do list.",

This is kind of a fancier place (the name sort of threw me.. in the states, chicken and waffle places are not super fancy.)2. During a normal breakfast time you should have a \u00a0reservation, BUT if you don't want to deal with that, you can go up and have coffee in the bar and enjoy the same view. Awesome.3. It is on the 40th floor, so if you are afraid of heights, or have issues with an elevator with an amazing view, be aware.We had the duck and waffles and it was really good. Service was outstanding, and everything from the coffee to the bacon was awesome. Plus the view was amazing. Highly recommend!",

    "text": "There are just some experiences that make you realise how lucky you are to live in a city like London. The Duck and Waffle being one. I've wanted to go to the Duck and Waffle ever since hearing about it and it's late night opening and I truly can't believe it took me so long! But then maybe because my heart was set on going for Sunrise I just haven't had the opportunity or was out at the right time before. My experience lived up to expectation. There is nothing more decedent than watching the sunrise steep across the city after a good night out. Observed from the panoramic view point, that is the top floor of the heron tower. All this whilst being basked in luxury. The venue itself has soft and comfortable booths and chairs, three walls of the restaurant are full length windows and the rich colours and quality fixtures make the ambience very cosy and inviting. The last wall is the open faced kitchen, where you can watch your food being prepared. Whilst London is supposed to be open all hours, few establishments took advantage of the 24 hour licencing laws, however the Duck and Waffle is one of the few, open for food and drink 24 hours a day. Whilst it's on the more expensive side at \u00a318 \u00a0a pop I had to try the dish that this restaurant is named after, and I have to say it was superb and worth every penny. It's sweeter than you'd imagine, but bursting with flavour. I loved the glazed duck skin and the meat whilst first appearing a little dry was absolutely amazing. The waffle complimented perfectly and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. My companions opted for the sloppy Joe sandwich (around \u00a310 a pop) and the seafood pie. Whilst the sloppy Joe was ill received the fish pie was enjoyed. Cocktails are absolutely beautiful, if also on the more expensive side, and they have a good wine selection. A beautiful venue, great attention to detail and an all-round great experience.",

I ordered more instead of a main as I didnt want pudding. Until my friend ordered pudding - then I wanted more brownie that I could have ever beleived.My 4 star is down to the fact that despite our repeatedly asking for water refils (6 times - but who's counting?!!) they refilled me once. In a place like this I would expect an auto refil service - hence my knocking a star off. That said - this was an awesome lunch and I would return again and again and again..",

This place in the Heron Tower house Duck and Waffle and also downstairs is the Sushi Samba (38th floor) and its fab cocktail bar. Duck and Waffle is on the 40th floor right at the top! The elevator is an experience in itself that you can do for free and wonder at the glass view over London.What I ordered at Duck & Waffle:- The duck and waffle - crispy leg confit, fried duck egg and mustard maple syrup. Sounds weird tastes great. A must try if going.- Crispy pigs ears. Comes in a cute bag to pick at.- Torrejas caramel with apples and cinnamon ice cream dessert. One of the best most decadent sweet desserts I have ever had.Second time I went I went for brunch and had:- Mushroom, egg truffle with soldiers that you could dip. Quite honestly it was out of this world.- Had the Torrejas again and it was just as good. Food coma-esque.As I said the view is spectacular, the atmosphere buzzing and the food ultimately outstanding. I will be back again very soon.",

I'd attempted to get a dinner reservation for a Friday night 2 months before the day itself but the earliest time I managed to secure was 9pm - speaks volumes for the popularity of the restaurant. Naturally I had high hopes. It was to be my first night in London, and I thought it would be a nice start to our trip in London, with the breathtaking views from Heron Tower.It was satisfying to bypass the long lines waiting to enter the restaurant, courtesy of our reservation. We took a glass elevator that zoomed up to the 40th floor. I had fun watching the city shrink under my feet.I'd requested for a table next to the window but unfortunately, we were placed in the middle, though we were allowed to walk over to take pictures at the window if we wished. Food-wise, it was definitely good, though not mindblowing. But many of them piqued my interest, and I'd have loved to try more dishes if I could.Ox cheek doughnut (to share) - Loved the fluffiness of the doughnut, with the sweet dough giving way nicely to the savory and tender meat within. The apricot chutney on the side was definitely the highlight of the dish.Duck & Waffle - it was a tad greasy for my tastes, but the egg, duck, waffle and syrup went nicely together for an explosion of savory and sweet. I chose not to drench the dish in syrup though, choosing to drizzle a little whenever i wanted.We were full by now but reviews raving about their torrejas tempted me. The combination of caramel, warm bread and cinnamon ice cream was heavenly, but by this time, I'd had too much sugar in the meal to properly appreciate it. A good place for a date, or a treat to marvel at the beauty of the city, but I may not necessarily be back soon.",

    "text": "I try hard not to be caught up in following the crowd when it comes to heavily hyped venues. Hence my internal restraint gene sounded when Duck & Waffle opened. Would the prices be hiked up as high as the 40th floor on which the restaurant was located? Was the 24 hour opening is cheap gimmick to attract publicity? Was the near legendary impossibility to get a table at a sensible time worth the pain and effort?In such cases, I wait until people who I respect like fellow Yelpers and some professional critics have had their say before committingIt was therefore a pleasant surprise when Hannah contacted me to say that she had secured a booking for breakfast here and whether I would like to join her. Thanks, Hannah! I got especially excited when she told me about the 'Millennium Falcon lift' as I'm a big Star Wars fan!Duck & Waffle is located in the Heron Tower and the entrance is very discreet with one person manning a booth on the ground floor checking that you have a reservation before letting you get into the lift. Well, that's the magic starts as the lift which whisks you up is glass fronted and has a view straight out, giving a quickly vertiginous view of the London landscape below, causing me to move back a little as I'm scared of heightsThey've designed the entry to the restaurant well as a corridor opens out into an amazing view of the London cityscape. It's strange to see the Gherkin below you! There's a real sense of light and space, which is carried over into the dining room, which has great views on 3 sides with the 4th side taken up by the open plan kitchenThe menu was more varied than I was expecting and we got a selection of dishes to share. Being a brunchy sort of occasion, Hannah got a mimosa and I got a freshly squeezed orange juice, which did taste a little watered down but freshThe Colombian eggs were essentially scrambled eggs on toast with a few vegetables thrown into the mix. Not the most exciting of dishes and we should maybe have accepted the waiter's offer of salt, pepper or tabasco when he delivered the dishHowever, the pan fried foie gras on toasted brioche with Nutella was super yummy though I'm not sure how one can go wrong with foie gras. It was rich, deep and nicely offset by the sweetness of the NutellaWe had to have the eponymous duck and waffle, which is a play on the southern American chicken and waffle, I suppose. However, the duck was more reminiscent of crispy aromatic duck, which is no bad thing but possessing a British palate, I found it a little to reconcile eating duck with waffle and sweet maple syrup. Nonetheless, the duck was tastyWe finished the meal by sharing poached peaches with tarragon ice cream and biscotti. The peaches were quite unevenly cooked with some remaining very crunchy and others much more mushy. The ice cream was a hit with fresh vibrant notes of tarragon clearly coming throughService was efficient rather than warm, even when we tried to engage our waiter about his favourite dish on the menuTaken in conjunction with the spectacular view, the meal was a hit. Without the view, I would say the food is OK. I know the prices do include a mark up for the location but overall, the prices are expensiveThanks for organising a fun breakfast, Hannah!",

Let's start with the service and the aimeizing view you get! Service was superb, but the view was EVERYTHING. You will literally be 50 floors up in the sky overlooking London. From the Tower Bridge to Big Ben, you can see it all from all diff angles. The restaurant is in a circular building so you best believe you will get the fill 360 view! Chicken and waffles is a very common dish but Duck and waffle? This dish comes in the perfect size, one nice piece of waffle cooked just right, nice crunch and not soggy at all. But everyone get s duck thigh! The juiciest part and the skin is fried to perfection. Now to top it off, they have their secret syrup they provide for you to drizzle on top. I can honestly say if you're ever in London, you really do have to make sure you check this place out. Did I mention they're 24/7?!",

And that's okay. \u00a0What I was unhappy with is that: I asked for my poached eggs to be well-done/hard, but 20 minutes later it came soft and runny. \u00a0I also did not get my yogurt and granola, which I had ordered with my meal (I ordered 'the full breakfast' from the menu combos). \u00a0While I ate, I reminded my server 3 times that I had ordered this yogurt, and he said he was aware. \u00a0When I finished my 'full breakfast', he said he would bring my yogurt. \u00a0I asked why it wasn't brought during my meal, and he told me it's because he assumed it was dessert. \u00a0No, yogurt was not a part of the dessert menu/section of the menu and if I had wanted yogurt for dessert, I would not have asked for it 3 times throughout my breakfast. \u00a0Our server was awkward. \u00a0Food was mediocre. \u00a0The view was the best part. \u00a0Overall, underwhelming.",

I am so glad we had to change because I don't think the day light would have done this magical place justice. It's all quite fancy, but a fun experience you definitely have to do. The doorman lets you in and you get whisked up to the 40th floor in a pink-lit lift - I got slight vertigo as you're on the outside of the building but the view was too exciting not to peek. At the top you enter the bar and are greeted by very smart and attentive waiting staff. We made our way to the table, as requested by the window. Wow. A candlelit dinner overlooking the wonderful city that is London with your favourite person is hard to beat. The late night menu has less choice but still does not disappoint. Being veggie I went for the Colombian Eggs (\u00a311) - served on toast and avocado, my boyfriend went for their signature dish, yep you've guessed it - duck and waffle (\u00a317). As we ate silence ensued, for us this means only one thing; we were loving every mouthful. We accompanied our dinner with a glass of the cheapest white wine on the menu (\u00a38!!!) but it tasted delicious and with it being so hard to book at table we thought we deserved it!The views of nighttime London really are stunning, you can see tower bridge and the Gherkin for an unusual viewpoint and the glimmer of transport, homes and offices for miles and miles - though I am a big environmentalist I couldn't help but enjoy the beautiful views over a scrummy dinner. We were pretty excitable all dinner and thoroughly enjoyed our late night trip. We have already made plans to come back when we can get a taste of the full menu. It isn't a cheap one, but I was admittedly expecting every dish to be over \u00a315 at least and this wasn't the case. I'm definitely going back as this was one of my most favourite eating experiences to date.",

I got the full Elvis waffle. PB&J and banana br\u00fbl\u00e9e? It's a winner. No questions asked. Also, one of the prettiest waffles I've ever seen. My other favorite was the duck & waffle. Hence, it's the name of the restaurant so it has to be good, right? The sweetness of the maple syrup and saltiness of the duck complimented each other very well. Yeah, it's more on the expensive side but so is everything in London. Would come back for sure!",

There is also a sushi samba on the floor below if you want another bar experience. The bar at D&W is open to the lounge. I didn't care for the graffiti wall and I can't seem to figure out the theme. It's very posh with people decking out and others clearly tourists. The food is excellent. The duck is a confit leg on a freshly made waffle with a duck egg. Yummmmmm.

We were immediately struck by the ambience, which features modern decor, stunning views and lively (but not annoying) music - all work together to offer up a vibe that is truly infectious.The five of us each selected a starter to share. I selected the spicy ox cheek donut - a pastry ball stuffed with shredded and seasoned ox cheek. I believe this was the table's favorite; absolutely delicious. The smoked eel was tasty, as were the yellowfin tuna and charred mackerel. The other favorite starter was the angus beef tartare served with onion, mustard and egg yolk (I did say the fare is eclectic, did I not??) Holy tartar, batman, my taste buds are dancing for joy. The flavor was incredible; OK, the table had two favorite starters.The Duck and Waffle is known for its...wait for it...duck and waffle so of course I had to try it. The dish features a duck leg quarter topped with a fried duck egg and both served atop a wonderful waffle. These were accompanies by a mustard maple syrup which had the perfect blend of sweet and savory to perfectly accompany the meal. My daughter chose the miso glazed rabbit, stating that she had never had rabbit before. I tasted it, and the flavor was incredible - no, it does not taste like chicken. She thoroughly enjoyed her meal as well.For dessert our table shared the baked Alaska -- you know, in all my years I have never tried baked Alaska?? Why not??? It was outstanding, along with the apricot and rosemary cake.All-in-all, this was a tremendous experience in all facets. We thoroughly enjoyed it, and I heartily recommend.",

One of my friend wore ripped jeans and I have to admit, I didn't read the dress code note but I always dress fine and 90% of us did. If my friend did not follow the dress code properly, then please deny access but do not let us enter and then judge us like we are worth less than others. Meanwhile we noticed other guests wearing sweatpants... come on! When we walked downstairs, we overheard the guys at the front door talking to each other and one of them asked the other one \"where they upstairs? who let them in?\" This is highly unprofessional and do not think only because we didn't talk English to each other that we don't understand it.In my opinion, exclusivity doesn't have to mean to be misanthropic. Exclusivity means having good food quality and a great ambience. The food was ok but we got to admit we only came for the view. I would recommend the view but do not expect a lot of the service (don't even want to get started to tell you about the service) and the food.",

The food was good: we had the donut, mackerel, lentil and beets salad (this was my fav), duck waffle and rabbit. Everything was really good. I'm taking off one star for the snobby hostess who made us stand there for 10 minutes while she looked at her screen trying to figure out where our party is sitting, even after we told her they're already inside. The food and experience was pleasant enough, but I wouldn't call this exactly a London must see.",

    "text": "My original plan was for me and my boyfriend to eat here and be able to watch the sunrise one morning while in London. I should have known you would need a reservation for something like that, but no worries, because I came back around lunch time and was able to wait and get a table. The wait wasn't as bad as we thought it would be, but we could have just gotten lucky.Although, we weren't able to get a window seat, the view was still amazing. We were able to sneak off to this little area in the corner to take a few pictures, before our waiter came out to get our order. While we were waiting for the table we had a chance to look at the menu, so we knew right off the bat what we wanted to try.We ordered the Seared Octupus, Duck and Waffle, and Angus Beef Tartare and just shared everything. The seared octupus was very tasty at first, but the seasonings/sauces were a little over powering, so we weren't able to finish it. The Duck and Waffle was very tender and I loved the flavor of the mustard syrup they gave you to pour over it. I would HIGHLY recommend getting the angus beef tartare, as it was seriously the best tartare I have ever had in my entire life. The mustard sauce and pickled onions were to die for and the crunch of the crouton went well with the melt-in-your-mouth angus.Our server was so sweet and friendly and was always checking on us and cracking jokes. Not one complaint.",

    "text": "Duck and Waffle was everything that I thought it would be. It's a restaurant on the 40th floor in London and boy were those views insane. Starting with the glass elevator before you get to the top. Crazy. Then to actually be sitting right next to the floor-to-ceiling windows for dinner was a mad ting. We ordered SO MUCH. Rosemary& garlic bread, cornbread with jalape\u00f1o and yogurt sauce. Amazing. The sauce was less yogurt and more of a creamy, zesty taste. Roasted Brussels sprouts. They were deliciously covered in a tangy brown sauce and slightly crispy. I ordered the duck and waffle. Half a Belgian waffle, duck leg, fried egg and syrup. This dish was amazing. I mean seriously, the waffle was cooked to the perfect golden color. The duck leg was crispy and taste like the better was fresh/clean. The egg was the perfect complement. While the maple syrup was just the right amount of sweetness. Tried my hardest to get every element in one bite. My sister ordered the artichoke ravioli which was deliciously flavored! The service at Duck and Waffle was impeccable. They refilled our wine and water glasses before they were low. The table and dish presentation was kept up the entire meal. After eating, of course we couldn't leave. We had to snap pictures of ourselves on my sister new camera on the 40th floor. Duh.So we did. A kind fellow that worked there took a few great pictures of us, saying that his job is part bartender and part photographer. We really enjoyed the night and this would be a lovely place to come to celebrate any occasion, with your SO or friends. It's beautiful from top to bottom.",

I arrived at 10:30pm to the restaurant on a Wed night. Not having a reservation, I expected a wait of around 30 minutes to 45 minutes. However I waited 1 hour and 25 minutes to be seated, which was 20 minutes over the time they said it would take for them to seat us, and by that time, the dinner menu had changed to the late night menu which wasn't what we had visited for. What was confusing was that most of the tables were empty but prepared yet they kept telling us that the seats were not ready and were being prepared. It also took a while to get the waiter's attention while we were waiting at the bar area to be seated in the dining area which didn't help with the already long wait.",

    "text": "Come here for a great view of the city, but don't come solely for the food. If you've never been here or you're visiting from out of town, this is a great place to come for weekend brunch, but the food was a little bit hit or miss for me. Some dishes were unique and delicious, but for the price and the hassle to get a reservation, I'm not really chomping at the bit to come here again. Come with 2-4 people so that you can share a few small plates. We were a party of 3, and I was able to make a reservation 2 months ahead of time online for a Monday brunch. Note that the brunch menu is only served on weekends and on bank holidays.BBQ Spiced Crispy Pig Ears (\u00a36) - Like the name of the dish implies, these are deep fried little slivers of pig ear and tastes and looks better than the mental image that you conjure. They are covered with delicious BBQ spices that are a tinge of sweet and spicy. Definitely unique and it was interesting to try and a good amount to share between 3-4 people.House Bread (\u00a36) - This isn't really worth \u00a36 in my opinion. Yes, it's super fresh and piping hot but I think it looks more impressive than it actually is. There's some spices and butter on top, so the top part of the bread is flavorful, but the bottom part is a little bland. The bland part went well with the foie gras creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, so at least that was salvageable. I would pass on the house bread.Duck and Waffle (\u00a317) - Obviously this is their signature dish, with a duck confit leg, an egg, and a waffle. It was good, but not sure it was worth \u00a317; I also had a duck and waffle dish in Miami that I liked a tinge better than this one. Good, and worth getting one for the table to share, but I wouldn't get multiple for the table - there are a lot of other shareable dishes to be had.Foie Gras Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e (\u00a313) - This was one of my favorite dishes of the meal. Very decadent, creamy, and a perfect torched, caramelised top. If you like foie, you will love this. Comes with a small brioche bread that pairs well.Spicy Ox Cheek Donut (\u00a312) - Another unique dish and worth getting for the table to share. It's a fresh, fluffy donut with a sugar and spice topping and a savory ox cheek braised meat inside. Definitely something you can't get elsewhere.Seasonal Salad (\u00a38, small, \u00a314, large) - Pass on the salad. If you feel like being healthy, go to Pret or Pod instead. The salad was mostly root vegetables that had been soaked for too long in some kind of vinegary mixture. It was salty and acidic and pretty indelible. I had just a few bites and everyone else forced it down and later admitted it was not good. Skip the salad here - it's not only expensive but not good.All in all, the food was a little hit or miss. The best were the foie gras creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the donut. The meal was a bit overpriced but I guess you have to pay for the view and the experience. Worth going once but don't kill yourself trying to get a reservation or waiting hours to eat here. I would come back to the bar for a drink and the view but don't think I'll be back for brunch.",

    "text": "This delicious 24-hour restaurant with the most amazing view in London generally requires reservations, however there was a couple who walked in with my boyfriend and I who were able to snag a table without. That being said, their table was in the center of the room, which sort of defeats the purpose of eating here. Luckily, my boyfriend made a reservation for us about a month in advance and even then they had no dinner availability so we ended up having a pretty amazing 9:00 A.M. breakfast.When we first arrived I was a bit intimidated by the glass elevator which was going to take us up to our 40th floor dining experience. While I would not consider myself unusually afraid of heights, I really do not like or trust elevators, but despite being nervous on the way up I also found myself enjoying the view that continued to improve with each floor.Once we arrived at Duck & Waffle I was immediately impressed with the ambiance of the place. The first room is a bar area that would be perfect for a girls morning brunch or after work happy hour. The half moon bar counter overlooks numerous Spanish and pub style tables. Some have a decent view out of the window and others are more central to the room, but overall I really liked the casual atmosphere. The second room in which we were seated was the more formal dining room. We honestly had the BEST seat in the house. It was a four person table placed in the back corner of the room which meant that we were surrounded by ceiling to floor glass walls with 360 degree views from the Thames River and Tower Bridge all the way to the Shoreditch area. I ordered the Smoked Salmon Royale which includes hen's eggs, horseradish and chives. I generally don't like horseradish, but I forgot to ask for it to be left off the meal and I honestly didn't taste it at all. Either horseradish is different in England than in the United States or it simply wasn't that strong. Either way I really enjoyed my breakfast. I will say that the eggs were a bit runny compared to what I am used to and I was unprepared for the salmon to be undercooked, but I found that is the norm in England and I grew accustomed to the textures quickly. My boyfriend of coursed ordered the Duck & Waffle which is basically the same as the more common Chicken & Waffle plate. He thought it tasted very similar, but preferred the duck as he said the meat had a more gamey flavor. As a lover of the oh so cute duck and being a pescatarian, I found his description to be unappetizing, but I am willing to bet that many of you disagree with me! I also ordered a glass of apple juice. I was a little disappointed that for the price there were no refills, but it was definitely fresh squeezed and delicious!I highly recommend that you come here whether you are visiting or local, but be sure to make reservations so you have priority for a window table!",

    "text": "Never mistake exclusivity for what is really arrogance & xenophobia.While in London on business, late events left my party of three in search of dinner and drinks. We agreed to meet at Duck & Waffle. My male friend who arrived first waited in the \"security\" line to say the rest of his party was arriving soon and he would like to wait for us upstairs where he could put our name on the list and get a drink. He was told no. When he questioned the guard and policy, the guard replied with a slur and told my friend to get lost. I learned of this exchange via text, and my friend was so upset that he chose not to wait for my other friend and I to arrive. He didn't want to discuss the matter any further. He decided to walk back to our flat alone. We protested and said we would all three go elsewhere, but our friend insisted we go on without him. Security allowed the two of us in, we were escorted to a table and before sitting down, I asked to speak to a manager. My three stars for Duck & Waffle are a result not only of a security guard's inflated ego that made him feel empowered to insult another person but because management took zero accountability for such actions. I was told that the restaurant has no authority over the security staff, which by that logic means restaurant management and ownership actually answer to the security guards. Who knew! It will be interesting to see how security staff choose to create upcoming menus, set prices and book special events. Admittedly I have no hard evidence of the exchange that occurred between my friend and the security guard -- only my friend's word and the firm belief he has no reason to make up such a thing or lie to me. My friend is a Mexican by birth who moved to Canada as a youth and now serves in the Canadian military as a medic; my other friend present that night is a Korean-American doctor; I am a white American woman; the guard was a black man I presume to have been English. In addition, other Yelpers have commented that they have experienced similar behavior from security staff. Full disclosure - I wish I had left after talking with management and my concerns being dismissed, but I did not. And yes, the food was lovely. We took an order of duck and waffles to go for our friend. However I wish we hadn't spent a dime - and I hope management realizes there would have been several more dimes spent if our party of three had been able to enjoy dinner together. As it stands, I will not go back, and I will encourage others not to patronize Duck & Waffle until management effectively address what has emerged as a pattern of discrimination.",

    "text": "Duck & Waffle is beautiful. This is an undeniable fact. Set 40 stories above London with a panoramic view, this restaurant definitely has the \"wow\" factor. I wish I could say the same about the food. I came away mildly disappointed with it. I came with two other people, and we order the namesake Duck and Waffle, the Spicy Ox Doughnut, a Lobster Creme Brulee, and one of their fancy breads to boot.The Duck and Waffle was quite nice. The Duck was crispy and tender; however, I wish more was done with the Waffle. It was your standard, boring waffle. Paying 17 pounds for it, there was still a lot to be desired. The Spicy Ox Doughnut, in my opinion, was the worst dish. While the meat inside was delicious, it didn't blend well with the doughnut itself, and the sauce that it came with almost overpowered everything with its sweetness. My two companions disliked the dish so much, they stopped eating their's entirely after a few bites.The Lobster Creme Brulee was okay. It was sweet and salty, as one would expect it to be. I didn't find it to be that great, but also not bad.The bread was possibly the best part of the meal! It was delicious and hot, had a great texture and flavor to it. Also quite a lot of it for only 7 pounds.Overall, their is still a great appeal to Duck & Waffle; however, for as much as we paid, I came away a little underwhelmed by the food. I feel as if they were almost trying to be too clever with some of these dishes.",

The foie gras was also very interesting, the combination sounds weird, but the flavours blend beautifully together.

Don't get me wrong -- the duck confit and waffle were both astounding as well. Perfectly cooked and crisp. However, it was the sauce that did the magic. It blended so well with the richness of the duck yet gave it an almost fruity touch that made the dish go down just perfectly. The venue is very posh with a great view of the city. Definitely a perfect place for any type of events. However, I did feel like the music was too loud at times. Service was good. Highly recommend it if you can get a reservation -- or just walk in past midnight!",

Onto the food - I'm an American and therefore a longstanding fan of Fried Chicken and Waffles (especially from Cafeteria in NYC - Yum!). I was a bit skeptical of the duck, but was completely pleasantly surprised! The skin was crispy, the meat was tender and their mustard maple syrup sounded terrible, but is just syrup with mustard seed in it (very good). We also shared the side of bacon, which came out in hearty, delicious slices. It was a bit confusing because it seems as if everyone is your server, rather than one designated person.

    "text": "When my boyfriend ordered Duck Congee, I was like, weird choice bro. He didn't know what congee was; I knew but had never had it. It seemed very left field. But oh my god, it was sublime. The creaminess of the rice, the moist crispiness of the duck confit, the flavour hit of the stock, the crunch of the hazelnuts, the zap of the sriracha. Seriously, this is one of the best meals I've tasted in a long time. It also looked great, reminiscent of a ramen bowl (at least before my boyfriend mixed it all up). I had major food envy, but I did also enjoy my own dish, which was ox cheek benedict, a twist on the classic, with a waffle replacing the muffin and ox instead of ham, though still with the egg and hollandaise sauce. It was tasty and I ate every morsel. We also enjoyed our drinks. They had a good selection of spirits. My main issue was that the cocktail menu was entirely vegetable-inspired. I love an inventive cocktail - in fact, I'd been dying to try the blue cheese and chocolate martini I'd heard D&W did - but given my aversion to veg, there was no way I was having something infused with caramelized red onion or with a roasted red pepper hanging out in the glass. Ick. I had a dirty martini, and it was just fine, if less eccentric. Plus, we had a corner table with a great view on both sides. We were lucky with the weather, which was supposed to be overcast but actually was fairly blue skies punctuated with large fluffy clouds. So why not five stars? The main reason is waiting around. We (and presumably most people there) booked a couple of months in advance, we arrived on time, but we ended up spending about 25 minutes waiting in the holding area bar to be seated. I wouldn't have minded this too much if it had been communicated that there was a wait, but I was assuming we'd be seated any minute so didn't order a drink or relax. Then when we were at our table, service was quite slow. The food itself arrived fast enough, but when we spent a while waiting for our order to be taken, our plates to be cleared, the bill brought to us, etc. We weren't in a huge rush (and I would certainly have hated to have whizzed through it), but it did feel sometimes like we were being neglected. The menu was also a bit confusing - there were several sections and it was unclear to us whether we could have ordered from any of them as a suitable 'main course' (they were all in the same price bracket), or whether some were more starters, sides, or tapas-y alternatives. However, overall it was great. Duck & Waffle delivered what we are so often looking for: delicious, unexpected new experiences.",

    "text": "The view is amazing - make sure you book a table before sunset so you can enjoy it during daytime, sunset and night!The cocktails are quite good, though pretty pricey.The food is also excellent, though the egg on our duck and waffle was quite overcooked so we asked for a new one which they replaced (after about 15 minutes...) and comped from the bill, which was nice.We ordered:- Beef tartare - good, but not the best I've ever had. I would skip it next time.- Puy lentils - the standout small plate - definitely recommend these! Hearty and savory.- Glazed lamb breast - The pieces of lamb were a bit dry and tough, but the overall dish was served on lettuce with vegetables that were really tasty. - Seasonal vegetables - the surprise winner. Beets, goat cheese, radicchio, carrots, seeds - tons of fresh, deliciously seasoned vegetables paired with a yummy goat cheese.- Duck & Waffle - like I said, the egg was overcooked, but when we got a runny yolk, it was outstanding. I see why this dish and restaurant are so popular.- Miso glazed rabbit - REALLY good. Don't be frightened by the rabbit - the miso glaze makes it taste like chicken or any other plain white meat. What's cool about this place is its location, view and the fact that it's open 24 hours.",

    "text": "This place was the highlight of my trip to London. It sits atop the Heron Tower and provides impeccable views. My GF and I both had the duck and waffle and a bloody mary for breakfast (7:45 am reservation).The food was freaking fantastic. I'm from the south US and chicken and waffles are a staple around here. This blew my mind. Absolutely perfect meal. It was 15 pounds and about 14 pounds for the bloody mary which was fine.You must make a reservation between day/evening hours but it's 24/7 and I'm not sure how accessible it is off-peak. But making the reservation and going to this place is a must for any person traveling to London. It was truly amazing and I have been telling everyone back home about it!",

    "text": "If you ever go to London, YOU'VE GOT to go to Duck & Waffle!Located in one of the highest buildings of this beautiful city, you will enter the door to Duck & Waffle on the ground-floor and be greeted by two handsome young men. Make sure you get a reservation in advance (around 3-4 months for weekend-spots at least if you would want to sit near the window) so you can pass those two with a smile.After that the elevator takes you to the 40th floor within seconds - that only is one hell of an adventure since everything is made out of glass and you will have to catch your breath because of the speed.If you reach the final floor, you enter a beautiful restaurant that is bright and decorated with big marvelous chandeliers! The friendly staff guides you to your table and you will have an amazing view over the whole city - from London Tower Bridge up until St. Pauls Cathedral! Not that this wouldn't be enough - but if you really want to make special memories, either match your visit with sunrise or sunset to have an extra spectacular view. - I promise getting up so early will definitely pay off in that case! ;-) Sitting there and enjoying the most outstanding view, the food will just top up your pleasure! You can either indulge in one of the very famous homemade \"Duck & Waffle\" (not just for breakfast but also served throughout the whole day) paired with delicious coffee or go for something more classic like a typical Full English with a Bloody Mary by the side. Yum!Thinking of that I would like to beam myself back to that weekend.. We really had a blast at Duck & Waffle - there was not one moment we didn't feel welcome and the staff really made sure we had everything we need. With regard to that I think it's ok that you will have to spend a little more money that usual on a breakfast. Having said that I also have in mind that food is more pricy in London compared to cities like Berlin. But investing a little something will redeem you with amazing memories if you choose to come see this place.I most definite wish I could go there more often and I can't wait for the next time I come to London to come by again! I'M IN LOVE!",

    "text": "Duck & Waffle is located on the 40th floor. It is open 24 hours. Did I get your attention yet?I came around 2 AM for a late dinner on a weekday. There was no wait but it was definitely filled with people in the bar and dining area. The two areas are separate so there are different vibes. The bar area is loud with music and people speaking amongst themselves over the music. It is very lively! Great spot to grab drinks with friends. The dining area has a great view of the city. My boyfriend and I ordered:--Duck Waffle: Better than chicken and waffles. Duck is fried and cooked perfectly. I usually don't like duck but I loved this! It didn't have that fatty duck taste to me so I was able to eat this. Waffle was crunchy and nicely toasted on the outside and soft and warm in the inside. Take a piece of duck, waffle and the sunny side up egg. Drizzle some warm maple syrup and you have the perfect bite. --Roasted Octopus: We met someone in the elevator and she suggested we order this. We were not disappointed. The octopus was super soft and tender. Loved the chorizo and roasted potatoes it came with. --Foie Gras Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e: This dish is amazing. Foie gras + creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is already a pretty good concept. You get a lot of foie gras compared to portion sizes in the U.S. So creamy. Order it!--Apple Toffee Pancakes: We ordered this for dessert and it was my second favorite thing on the menu. It actually comes with waffles, which is even better because you have that crunch from the waffle. I love the warm apples and honeycomb in this dish. Definitely a good pair with the cinnamon ice cream and warm waffle. Tips:--Make a reservation because this place can get fully booked--Ask for a table with a view",

And had to wait for 3 weeks to have breakfast at 7 AM. Well. It was definitely worth it. After seeing multiple hypes across social platforms and from friends, I knew there was something that was drawing everyone to have that experience of 'duck and waffle' at Duck & Waffle. On the top floor of one of London's tallest buildings, within the busiest hub of the city, we followed it through the same entrance as Sushisamba. Followed by nice blue white rustic china tiles, multicolored kitsch chandeliers scattered across the loft and brass embellishments. Escorted to our table next to the sky high ceiling overlooking the view of the city 'waking up', we decided to kickstart our morning with a few peculiar classics. We ordered the ox cheek benedict waffel, the signature duck & waffle, and decided to share the banana brulee as a desert. We also ordered fresh mint tea and fresh squeezed orange juice to accompany our dishes. The positive experience was the friendly, yet quirky professional service, the food coming fairly soon and waiters making sure that we were satisfied with our service. The food was delicious. The savory dishes went beyond my expectations. The duck & waffle consists of waffles accompanied by a crispy duck leg and an egg on top, to be seasoned with maple syrup that includes mustard seeds. The ox cheek Benedict includes cloudy poached eggs with tender meat and spicy chili sauce. \u00a0We were both extremely satisfied with our orders. I vaguely regret ordering the 'standard' sounding banana brulee. As from looking at pictures, the other two options including full elvis sounded much more elaborate. The sweet pancake was good. though nothing special. The biggest disappointment was the fresh mint tea that was not properly heated nor did not oxidize in the end as it is meant to. The 'freshly' squeezed orange juice was not that fresh. The other minor note that this venue should take into avvount is that all the dishes were served a bit too cold, as the venue is so sky high, the dishes cool down faster. Overall this experience was amazing. I could not have had a more romantic breakfast with fabulous service. The dishes are not even that pricey, perhaps vaguely above average spends for young professional newbies in London. The drinks on the other hand were overprices considering the quality of what they offer. Tip? Just order water. Will I be going again? Perhaps for another sweet waffle with stunning sky high views. It's open 24/7. I'd be pretty curious to know who dines at 3:30 AM..",

With my parents visit coinciding with my mum's birthday, I knew it was about time I finally stepped foot in Heron Tower's lifts for dinner in the sky!After a swift journey from the floor to the clouds (actually a lot less scary than I thought it would be), we were greated by the most amazing of views. D&W definitely doesn't oversell on this point; it's simply breath-taking.The rest of the experience though? It might be because, having read so many good things about the restaurant, I had really high expectations, but in the end, I wasn't exactly blown away by it. We had a good time at Duck & Waffle. Good but not great. I can't really pinpoint what it was, but there was something missing for me to be truly impressed. I was glad I finally got to visit and try all those iconic dishes, but I'm not sure I'll get out of my way to visit again. Or maybe for breakfast (just imagine those views at sunrise!).-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------What: One of London's most acclaimed restaurants, with the most breath-taking of views, serving up its Modern-European-with-a-twist signature dishes 24/7.How much: Count \u00a340-50/person with a drink and dessertWhy: The views are the #1 reason to head to Duck & Waffle and you have to be aware of the fact that you'll definitely be paying for it too. A lot of attention given to details, especially when it comes to presentation. Anything that sounds like a very unlikely dish (Foie gras cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, BBQ pigs ears, Duck & Waffle...) would actually be on my must-order list.cakeandwhisky.wordpress.\u2026",

I absolutely loved this place!On arrival, we were greeted by a cheerful chap in the lobby, who checked the booking, then directed us the elevator. Great ride up the 40 floors the restaurant in the glass lift, with great views towards the west of the city. There was a really nice bar area before you got to the restaurant itself, with an excellent view of the Gherkin building close by. Again the reservation was checked, before being directed to the table. We were led to a great table by the window, looking out to the Olympic Stadium to the East, and the Emirates Stadium to the North. I already loved the atmosphere here. It was much smaller and intimate than I thought it would be.I was not sure whether to go with the full English, the Haddock or the signature Duck & Waffle. I decided to go with the English, thinking that by not having the Duck & Waffle, I'd have a good excuse to come back. When it came the breakfast looked great. I had already offered my black pudding, as I do not like it. When I saw the black pudding though, I thought I would give it a taste, as it looked like no black pudding, I have ever had. It was delicious, and reminded me very much of haggis. The eggs were over medium, and perfect. The bacon was crisp and non-greasy. I enjoyed everything about it. The service was very attentive whilst we ate, with the water being continuously topped up.This place is already on my must do again list!",

    "text": "After a long Thursday night pub crawl, my friends and I realized that we hadn't eaten dinner yet and were hungry. So we decide to hop into an Uber for some delicious duck and waffles. We arrived around 11:20 PM and encountered one of the rudest, most stuck-up bouncers I have ever met. There is literally a red velvet rope in front of the entrance and the guy will turn his nose up at you if you don't have a reservation. Apparently they don't take walk-ins until midnight. Seemed pretty silly to us considering how many people were leaving the restaurant and how close to midnight it was. We were pretty annoyed but head off to a nearby bar to grab more drinks while waiting (what we really wanted to find was a diner but we were unsuccessful and still very hungry).We get back again right around midnight and the rude bouncer is replaced with a nicer bouncer! He immediately lets us in and we get in the elevator up. Amazing view and trendy decor in the lounge area. There's a 15 minute wait for a table so we sit at the tables by the bar, order some drinks, Crispy Polenta, and BBQ-Spiced Crispy Pig Ears. Before we get our food and drinks, our table is ready! We head into the dining room and the loud music and dim lighting is replaced by a quiet dining area with more light, amazing views of London, and tons of people eating at midnight. It blows my mind that so many people want to eat meat at this time of day.We're seated, all order the Duck & Waffle, and enjoy our appetizers. Those polenta balls, yum yum. The pig ears were a little overseasoned, but had a nice crunch. The Duck & Waffle was delicious. A delicate half waffle with duck confit, an egg, and delicious syrup. I don't like chicken and waffles, but duck and waffles is excellent. The waffle absorbs a bunch of the grease and the syrup balances out the duck flavor. Yum yum. The food is overpriced, but you're paying for the view. Service is also excellent (rude bouncer aside). Would come back, but earlier in the day and only with a reservation.",

But that's just me. Ok ok The food.... this is the part you want to read about. It was just ok and a bit lack luster. We made reservations in advance with 1.5 hr for lunch. I was expecting it to be over crowded as we arrived early and people were waiting. Oddly that was not the case, the restaurant was pretty empty. Ordered pigs ears--an acquired taste for some, but deliciously crunchy and well seasoned. It was served in a paper bag. Not really aesthetically interesting or pleasing, but still tasty. I don't get it. Put it on a plate please. The beef cheek donut? A disappointment. It tasted ok, a bit sweet. The sauce it came with smelled so yummy but was also overly sweet. The beef was tender but it tasted like regular shredded beef and the donut just wasn't very impressive. Donut was lack luster and flat. Not as good as I had hoped. Duck and Waffles. The signature waffle dish was a real disappointment. It was a waffle wanna be that just didn't show up. It just didn't have any distinction to it. It was not a good waffle. It was a bit dense and had no flavor to it. Not crispy on the outside or fluffy. Imagine a fortune cookie flavored waffle that's what it tasted like. The accompanying maple syrup with mustard seeds was also disappointing, the maple syrup had no maple syrup flavor just overly sweet. If the mustard seed flavoring has been infused it may have been better. Add a dash of salt or something it just tasted like pure sugar.The duck, first bite was really good. It has some five spice powder flavoring but it was a bit over fried for my taste, and a bit heavy. Halfway through the duck leg I was done. It just no longer held my taste buds, it wasn't a must keep eating this duck. It was ok good first bite and the more I ate the less interesting it became. Something was missing from the duck. Come for the view. Don't bother with their signature dish, try something else? They had a delicious tea recommendation for the waffle.",

    "text": "Duck & Waffle is a must go for anyone dropping by London, or even for a local in search of an amazing view of the London skyline while eating some delectable bites.First off, the view. In the bar area which serves as the precursor to the seated area, you have an amazing view of the skyline, including the famous Gherkin or \"pickle\" and the sight is framed by the numerous chandeliers that hang in front of the clear glass wall. In the dining area, I suggest requesting a seat by the edge -- this will give you a beautiful view of the city.The interior design is another gorgeous aspect of the restaurant, especially at the bar area. (have I mentioned the chandeliers yet?) Large collections of glass bottles are grouped together in giant circles on the ceilings and the bar area itself is a delight to look at. The food itself was also very good. I recommend their signature dish, the duck and waffle. The drinks themselves were also very good. I particularly liked the Pine Needle Lemonade, which is a gin drink with hints of elderflower; it was a minty, refreshing combo. The Breakfast Fizz was also an interesting concoction. This one is a Grey Goose mixture tasting of grape juice fused with a hint of burnt toast. The latter taste is definitely one of the quirkier ones I've tried in an alcoholic drink.Overall, the restaurant is a trendy, although upscale place that I definitely recommend.",

It was quite the unusual flavor. \u00a0Main complaint was not being given a spoon to finish off the broth.",

    "text": "Customer Service - Snotty and Discriminating.Our flight landed Heathrow Airport at around 9PM and got to our hotel close to 10:30PM. We heard about Duck and Waffle being 24/7 and headed straight there after dropping our luggage in the hotel. I wore jeans and chucks. Point taken, they have a dress code. The bouncer, however, was obnoxious in pointing that out that no jeans and sneakers were allowed after 4PM. When we tried to ask a question, he was disrespectfully ignoring us. We gave this restaurant a benefit of the doubt. We dressed up and the security guy now tells us that they're completely full. When we told him we were willing to wait, the security guy tells us it'll take a couple of hours before we can get in and implied it was pointless to stay. We do understand it was a long weekend but this could have been prevented when the bouncer the previous day answered us respectfully. By the way, we saw some guests leave the restaurant in their sneakers.After writing an honest bad review, the director of their parent company responded. He explained that they are in the process of reviewing their policies. To quote him:\"One of which is clarifying the dress code, (currently Designer Trainers like Prada, Dolce Gabana, etc are acceptable), with the ownership and amending as they will allow, addressing attitude and ensuring the Team understands that our guest needs to be treated with hospitality 100% of the time.\"To make up, we were given a reservation. The management and staff were very gracious giving us VIP treatment from the time we got in until we headed our way out. The director paid for our dinner as well. Two things we've noticed: the door staff were a lot less intimidating, also, we saw a lot of people in their jeans as well as non-designer slippers at 8PM which gives me the impression that the dress code is quite arbitrary. You'd be lucky if the bouncer likes you. :)Food - Hit and MissThe best thing we've had would be the Bacon-Wrapped Dates. My wife and I both agree on that.The roasted octopus. It was good but not great.The ox-tail doughnut. Well, I appreciate the attempt on creativity. However, it's trying too hard. Really.The duck and waffle. I like their twist of the Southern Chicken and Waffle. I worked with clients in the Southern part of the US so I love Southern food. My wife, however, was underwhelmed. Between the two of us, she's the duck fanatic whether it's Asian or European style cooking. She did not like it at all.Overall experienceWe thank the management for paying for our meal and giving us VIP treatment. But overall, it was not worth the trouble. If you do want a good view of London, buy a ticket from the London Eye and take the 30-minute ride. If you want good food, find it elsewhere. Some place where they could give a good customer service. But if you do insist, make sure you make a reservation even if most of the reviews you see in Yelp say they got in without one. Second, make sure you go with the dress code. If you insist on wearing sneakers, make sure the brand is loud enough to see - Prada, Dolce and Gabana, etc. By the way, my wife saw some people head out of the restaurant in their Converse. Basically, just pray the door staff likes you.",

From the super friendly, entertaining staff (who were not at all snooty - as you might expect in a more well to do place like this), to the insane views of London, to the random, but yummy cocktail choices - mine had pumpkin in it!, to the atmosphere, to the food, I can't knock any of it. I got the Duck and Waffle - obvious choice, I know ;) - but it was worth it.TIPS:1) If it's winter and, like me, you feel the cold easily, DO NOT choose the seat right by the window. You, like me, will freeze.2) If you want to keep partying, but have nowhere to go since most clubs close at 3am in London, this place is great for watching the sunrise with a loved one - or anyone really -, has great DJs and at that time, you can generally just make a reservation online minutes before you rock up there and get in with no problem.ENJOY!",

The common ownership is obvious since the decor and layout is almost exactly the same in the restaurant. I prefer the lounge area at Sushisamba, as there is more room without a giant bar in the middle.Food was generally forgettable. The few starters we tried were the ox-cheek donuts, grilled octopus, flatbread and the pig ears. The pig ears served in a brown bag were nice to have while we were having drinks in the lounge as we waited for our table. The signature dish, however, (duck confit + duck egg + waffle) was pretty great. I love chicken and waffles, so of course I loved duck and waffles. As my friend once asked, \"Why would you ever choose chicken when you can choose duck?\" Correct.",

We decided to try in the morning thinking surely at 6 am they would have a table for 2 available.

When my parents had decided to come and visit me from Australia, I knew this would be a fun place to take them.I emailed the restaurant and asked about their menu and when was the best time to come in and try the bacon wrapped dates. They were extremely helpful, and assisted me in making a reservation for my mothers 50th birthday lunch. I had asked if we could have a seat with a nice view.Well upon arrival I was instantly in awe. This place is amazing. The views are incredible, the bar you walk through on arrival is unbelievable. I honestly couldn't believe how amazing it all was. We were guided to our table which was directly facing the windows. The waitress even wished my mother a happy birthday. The menu houses some items which were a bit of a shock to my parents, as they haven't experienced the sweet and savory style dishes that Duck and Waffle offer. We ordered sharing platters, and as they were bought out, each platter gained an 'ooooo' , 'ahhhh' from the three of us. The highlight of my meal was the pigs ears and of course the bacon wrapped dates. My parents thoroughly enjoyed the duck and waffle. After all our delicious meals were eaten and we'd passed on the dessert, the waitress bought out the cutest little plate with roasted sugared almonds, marshmallow, and some rose water cream with some chocolates, with a candle. Which was a nice surprise.The whole experience was simply amazing, and I cannot wait to have another visitor to take back here. The food is very reasonably priced for the location and the entire experience.",

Went in the morning for breakfast only to be denied access because I had no reservation, which is understandable but then I tried to make one and that was denied as well. Came back in the evening for a drink but was denied again by the bouncer who apparently held an discriminatory opinion against my sneakers ( I am sure if they were designer I'd have no issue at all). Is it because we are students and look young that we are automatically labelled as undeserving to a classy restaurant that is supposed to prove that class precisely by showing welcome to everyone? Definitely not a place I'd ever revisit even if I could. Oh I am sorry I wasn't able to write a splendid review on your fabulous food since I was never granted the regal access to try it.

Since it is on top of the Heron Tower, you can have a great 360 degree view of the city. It has a nice cocktail bar as well. The best time to go there, in my opinion, is after party at around 2-3 in the morning. Don't think you can get in without a problem in the wee hours of the morning. You will be surprised at the number of night owls showing up at this joint. The bouncers always make you wait if you don't have a reservation. Don't be deterred. It is well worth the trouble. A nicely cooked duck leg with an egg on top sitting on a waffle at 3am is just divine. Oh, you have to pour the maple syrup with mustard seeds all over everything. I am already planning on doing this during summer months. You can enjoy great food while watch the sun rise above London. That must be a glorious sight.",

We wouldn't be able to make it to brunch, so we decided on the dinner (well, late night meal, I guess).This place is on top of the Heron Tower, at the really thin part, so all the restaurants up there get amazing views of all sides of the tower. The first thing you see after you entered the restaurant, is a cool, hip bar, with tons of ingredients and alcohol for making cocktails -- might be a good place to stop by for a drink. On the other side of the bar is the kitchen and the restaurant.We did eat a little bit a couple hours prior, but were already hungry by the time we were seated. We got the pig ears, the beet salad, and the duck & waffle to share, as well as a couple well-crafted cocktails.The pig ears were crispy and well spiced -- probably better as a snack than an appetizer -- but we liked them nonetheless, even the mister who normally doesn't eat these weird animal bits. Their signature dish, the duck & waffle, was really well done -- the duck was moist, tender, with amazingly crispy skin, and the fried duck egg on top of the waffle was delicious as well. It is not a big plate, so if you are sharing you might have to fight over the food.The beet salad...well, meh. I don't know what we were thinking as we are from California...Onto the cocktails. Their cocktails are not cheap, but they have a huge list of very interesting savory cocktails, and they were crafted expertly. For those connoisseurs who like salted caramel, bone marrow essence, or blue cheese in their drinks, the D&W signature drinks will satisfy.I am glad I managed to eat at one of the \"happening\" places in London. The claim that British food is bland is thoroughly debunked. While it is true that they borrowed quite heavily from their former colony *cough NYC cough*, it is a good thing especially when infused with a British attitude!",

I was told by several friends that this place was great as it serves food during the early hours of the morning. A friend of mine and I headed over around 12am from Smithfield's Piano Bar just around the corner in the \u00a0Liverpool Street Area to join a queue of people standing outside shivering in the wind and cold.We spent about 15 minutes in the queue and then joined an excited crowd into the lift that shot us up to Duck & Waffle. We were allowed into the bar area with no problems and headed to the lady at the desk at the entrance of the restaurant. The lady explained that without a reservation we would have to check back every 20 minutes and that we could have some bar snacks whilst we waited. I asked if they could take our name and number so that we were on a waiting list. She replied that there was no waiting list and you have to keep checking back every so often. In our defeat, we decided to check out Sushi Samba downstairs. The Kitchen in this restaurant, we were told, was closed and when trying to go back upstairs we were denied entry by a bouncer standing in front of a cordon rail. I was fuming at this point at how pretentious it was and luckily the bouncer could see the pointlessness of not letting us back up was. He released the cordon rail to allow us back upstairs to the bar area of Duck & Waffle. There was still nowhere to sit down, but after standing around like 2 young lemons, \u00a0some free high chairs became available by the window. The bar snacks were very measly and of course were really overpriced. The ones we did want to order, pig cheeks, which were something like \u00a33 each and what in fact turned out to be 75% of the menu, was no longer available past 11pm. I tried again in my perseverance to see if there was a table free. The lady behind the desk said no, come back in 20 minutes.My friend and I ordered some bread that came with cheese which was something like \u00a36 and some olives. Service charge was of course added. To add to my already present fury, the waiter brought us our bill as soon as we had ordered! I didn't think this was very welcoming at all. We ate our less than average bar snacks, paid our bill and I tried one last time to see if we could get a seat in the restaurant. The lady gave an unsympathetic no I'm sorry we don't do a waiting list, it's just the way it is. She didn't even bother to check inside the restaurant. We had spent money on some rubbish bar snacks to still be turned away. I understand staying at the bar does not guarantee a place in the restaurant but we had hung about for 45 minutes. If it's to do with dress code, we were in heels and a dress so I can't imagine that was the problem... I would expect more from such a highly reputed establishment. It doesn't take a lot to go the extra mile for your customers. If there is such an issue with reserving and a lack of seating in the bar area, they should let people know whilst they are in the queue downstairs. My friend and I basically queued outside to no seating in the bar area or in the restaurant. All in all, it was a bit of a waste of time really. We ended up getting a hotdog and sandwich opposite Liverpool Street Station we were still famished. No issues getting hold of those unsurprisingly....",

    "text": "Duck & Waffle served delicious food and drinks in addition to having a FANTASTIC view of London just north of the Thames! I came with a party of 4 on a Wednesday night. You certainly need to make a reservation in advance, or else you won't be able to get past the bouncer and then experience the DW bar and restaurant.Our last-minute reservation was for 10:45PM, and we quickly ascended the elevator to the 40th floor. The doors open up to a corridor that then leads to a trendy bar area with smooth vibes and a lounge-y feel. Past the bar is the seated area for the actual restaurant, which was absolutely packed even at 10:45PM.We were seated at a booth facing the ceiling-to-floor windows. Drinks ensued (cocktails are \u00a313), and I ordered the Duck and Stormy. It's presentation reminded me of the Prohibition -- the ginger beer bottle with encased in a brown bag with a waxed seal (sticker). I was more than satisfied with this drink to start the night. Another friend ordered their spicy bellini cocktail, which was also great! We decided to split various dishes. We started out with their guanciale and goat cheese bread, which was served piping hot. Then, we ordered the spicy ox cheek doughnut, which was HUGE, not spicy at all, and surprisingly doughy (in a good way). We then split two duck & waffle dishes, which were definitely the highlight of the night. The crispy skin and slight salty duck breast perfectly complemented the sweet waffle-and-maple syrup combo. We finished off with the smoked mozzarella salad, which was super smoky and topped with lots of fresh watercress. The underlying homemade granola was crunchy and sweet.We finished dinner with dessert -- two torrejas and another raspberry sorbet/marshmallow dish. The torrejas were AMAZING. A bit overwhelmingly sweet, but the cool, cinnamon ice cream and the roasted apple slices with brioche french toast topped with a hot, spiced cider sauce worked perfectly together. Altogether a great experience, and I would come again.Tl;dr -- highlights were the duck & waffles and the Torrejas. Great view!",

    "text": "The Duck and Waffle has been on my tick list for a while now and having recently been to SushiSamba my expectations were indeed as high as the 40th floor, where the restaurant is located!I can confirm with no hesitation whatsoever that expectations were met, indeed surpassed. Not much to say about the views, just stunning (even on an overcast day).The food is as adventurous as I've seen in a while and those who are looking for a new experience will be thrilled with the menu and the taste/quality of food.I'm guessing the menu changes monthly, so if you are going in September I can highly recommend the crispy pig ears, bacon wrapped dates and pollockmeatballs.The dilemma came in choosing a main course; steak, fish or the signature duck and waffle? As this was my first visit, it had to be the duck and waffle. Suffice to say, innovative, substantial and just damn tasty! My party of 5 were celebrating a birthday, so following the self-indulgence of ordering a delicious dessert (the Torrejas), we were then treated to a 'birthday cake' from the house, which was very much appreciated and a very professional touch.A special mention for our waiter Andre who was attentive and helpful. What a thoroughly nice chap!So what's left to say, nothing much other than given the location, experience and food the Duck and Waffle is excellent value for money, I can't wait to go back again and I wish I could give it a 6 star rating.Well done guys, you've absolutely nailed it!",

    "text": "First off the setting is outstanding. Resting 40 floors in the sky is this culinary wonderland that has a 360 degree view of London. Second, the food is really good. Aside from the amazing views, and great food, is the fact that it is open 24 hours a day. That is crazy considering you have to take an express lift to the 40th floor. How hard must that be after putting down a few or many in the course of an evening? The hostess told us that they recommend guests book a reservation for 3am because the lines can get long.Now back to the food. I was with a big group so I got to try many things. We started off with bread. There are 6 options and we went with 2; guanciale with welsh goat's cheese and n'duja with gruyere. The guanciale with welsh goat's cheese was outstanding. The bread was soft with great chew and the guanciale was crispy and its saltiness balanced out the flavor of the goat cheese, perfect combination.We followed that up with a bunch of starters. The crispy pig ears were my favorite because they were fried perfectly and also tasted like BBQ Lays potato chips, or BBQ Lays crispy pig ears. The spicy ox cheek doughnut was good, a little weird with the apricot jam because it was a strong contrast between sweet and savory. The roasted octopus was very tasty. Kind of brought me to Spain with the mixture of chorizo and it was hearty since it was served with potatoes. The foie gras cr\u00e8me brulee was a solid dish. I have had this at other restaurants where it comes off too sweet, but this one had the right balance which created an almost umami flavor. I don't know if it needed the lobster on top, but who says no to lobster. The scotch bhadji was an adventure and looked like a work of art. My friend said it pretty much mixed two of his favorite things, a scotch egg and onion bhadji. We did add vegetables to the meal, you know to round it out. We ordered the smoked mozzarella salad and it was a nice balance and refresher to the meal right before we got to the duck & waffle. It reminded us of something we would be able to order in California.Now after all of that and truly being very full we got our orders of the duck and waffle. Let me tell you, I wish I had this in the states. I love duck and to have the following all in one plate is just awesome. There is a perfectly fried duck leg confit, topped with a fried duck egg, over a fresh waffle, and maple syrup...bliss.Make sure to make reservations for anytime you want to go because it is a popular joint. \u00a0And don't hesitate to get there before your reservation to enjoy a drink at the bar and take in the amazing views.",

And certainly don't bother yourself with standing too long in line.Fortunately, there was no line when we arrived, just a few minutes past midnight. The host initially made a pretentious show of exclusivity by asking if we had reservations, but after we said unabashedly replied no, he quickly ushered us our table.The famous Duck & Waffle (\u00a317) was a huge disappointment. The duck confit was meaty but fried to the point of being dried out, and the waffle, despite its good color, was a limp and mealy mess. Maybe it's because I'm an American and can get a respectable waffle at just about any pancake and waffle house in the States -- and without the attitude and ostentation, I should add -- but this waffle was just pathetic. Not even a healthy pour of the mustard maple syrup could save it. The Spicy Potatoes (\u00a311) weren't all that spicy, but they were at least edible. And for such a fancy bar, the beer selection pretty much sucked. I paid \u00a37 for an Asahi and instantly regretted it. Based upon the reviews, you would think that this place would be a knockout, but in my opinion, it was a duck and a miss.",

We had the duck and waffle, the beef cheek Benedict and some BBQ toast. Everything (except maybe the toast) was amazing. The confit duck had a gloriously crisp skin and tender but not the slightest bit overcooked meat, and the bright orange yolks on the poached eggs in the Benedict managed to surpass the housemade Sriracha.

We considered buying the Duck and Waffle dish but decided instead to go with crispy polenta, beef tartar, and ravioli. All were so fresh, with beautiful presentation and served in about 15 minutes, not long! Our servers made sure we were taken care of and always courteous.

The latte was fabulous and agree with other reviews that a coffee at bar may be the best option. Of course, if you can score a time with the raved about bartender I'd still try the cocktail at bar. Service was impeccable. Take advantage of reservations and try to catch sunrise/sunset. It is worth booking a few weeks in advance because the view is breathtaking.",

We ordered a few small plates, the duck and waffle main, and the whole roasted chicken, and it was more than enough for 4 people. My son took half a chicken home. The signature duck and waffle small plate was interesting, but not amazing. Everything else was top notch. We had the salted house bread, which was like a very salty puri and very hot. Excellent. The artichoke ravioli, the Brussels sprouts and the goat kofte were all interesting and delicious. Service was fast. Almost too fast, like they were moving us along, but still professional. And finally, The view was incredible, if you could see past the twenty somethings continually posing for selfies in front of the floor to ceiling windows. \u00a0 If you can't make reservations for dinner, go to the bar. View is amazing there as well. \u00a0Top marks.",

    "text": "Admittedly I was intrigued by and came here for the views and the booze, not the food.I have this 'thing' where I like to grab a drink at the highest point I possibly can when visiting a city. \u00a0I like to see the world from up high. \u00a0There is no better place in London than Duck & Waffle.I made a reservation way far in advance since I knew I was traveling, but at 1130 we were among just a few tables in the restaurant. \u00a0They sat us up against the window with an East/Southeast view from the table. \u00a0Note: if you're going to do this place right, you need a window seat. \u00a0You can eat in the middle of a restaurant anywhere else.Since we ate breakfast roughly 2 hours before arriving we were not really hungry, so we put in a drink order and for some shareables. \u00a0SO had the Hay! while I had a glass of the rose. \u00a0Rose all day for me since it was unseasonably warm in London. \u00a0Both great.When it came to food we wanted to sample without stuffing out faces, so we decided on 4 items. \u00a0First, the pig ears are a show stealer. \u00a0They were super crispy and plentiful. \u00a0The seasoning had quite a bit of flavor and a nice kick. \u00a0Our second item was the crispy polenta. \u00a0Huge hit! \u00a0And actually, this was probably my favorite thing that we tried. \u00a0Although small (two polenta balls) the flavor was perfect and the crisp was just right. \u00a0One drawback for me is that the sauce was a parmesan mayo, and because I hate mayo, I wiped most of it off. \u00a0We had the beat so we went with the beet root which was not only beautiful but tasted beautiful as well. \u00a0So fresh! \u00a0Our last item was the rosemary garlic bread. \u00a0This was a close second to my favorite because I could eat delicious bread every day. \u00a0It was piping hot (so be careful!) and had plenty of crisp crust and rosemary garlic flavor. \u00a0A must for every meal!As far as the dress code, it lists \"smart\" on the website. \u00a0I was unsure of the extent of the term and I would say that nice jeans, a button down or equivalent, are perfect. \u00a0I did not see anyone in jackets (granted, it WAS warm) and felt that there were several people dressed less smart than I. \u00a0Nightlife? \u00a0Maybe a different story.I will not lie and say this place is inexpensive as we ran the equivalent of a $75USD tab for what was really just some quick snacks. \u00a0However, everyone deserves some nice things, and the views make the experience completely worth it. \u00a0Next time I am in town I will definitely be back!",

Duck&waffle is okay, duck leg is not very juicy, actually a little chewy, but I like the flavour of it so it's okay. The waffle is very ordinary and has nothing special, not crispy or moist enough. The sunny egg on top of that could be seasoned more, it tastes a little blend.Tried the dessert Torrejas, it's very sweet but I like it to be sweet, cinnamon ice cream is really creamy and intense. The French toast in it is good too!The cocktail Truffle is a little disappointing, a bit too strong and less sweet&savoury.",

    "text": "All sorts of winning. Yes, it is expensive, but the ratio of price:winning is very good compared to lots of places in London. We showed up wanting dinner around 11pm on a Wednesday, with no reservation. Doorman said \"Fully booked, but there's a pub down the street that I think is still serving burgers.\" I said, \"Not interested in burgers. Interested in oysters. Anything we can do?\" And things were done. We ended up with a fantastic table by the window looking out over Tower Bridge and the river. Started out with mixed oysters and smoked eel. Oysters were delicious - properly shucked, lots of liquor. Paired brilliantly with the cocktail I had, the \"Mind Your Ps and Qs,\" basically a G and T infused with sweet pea and hopped up on mint. Eels won on multiple fronts - packed with umami and elevated our bottle of Bordeaux. For mains, we had duck and waffle and ribeye. Ribeye was cooked perfectly - we ordered \"rare\" and got what would be considered a perfect medium rare Stateside (British beef temperatures are a step hotter than those in the U.S., so a note to my fellow Americans - if you want your steak medium rare here in Londontown, order it RARE!). Marrow bone made it even more delicious. As for the duck and waffle, its virtues have already been covered very well here. Basically, delicious. The wine list seems to focus on famous labels, which would make sense for a 24-hour place in the City, where bankers can take clients to impress them. Many of the wines at the \"low\" end are priced aggressively - a Prodductori Barbaresco for over \u00a370 that would sell for around 30 Euros in a restaurant in Italy (I've had that wine in a restaurant in Alba for about that and have purchased retail for 15 Euros - it is a very good wine but NOT worth \u00a370). They did have some high-end Sassicaia and first-growth Bordeauxes that were priced competitively - again, great for City people, but above my price range on this particular occasion. We had a nice Medoc for around \u00a380 that sort of underdelivered but paired pleasantly with our dinner. Post-dinner, my husband had a glass of the Cotes du Rhone that was on the list for under \u00a350 per bottle that actually over-delivered and probably next time, we'll go for a bottle of that.Cocktails are fantastic. We had too many - for sure above our allotted number of \"UK Units\" of alcohol. I have no complaints about any of the myriad ones we tried, so I suggest trying whatever fits your personal taste.In all, a winning restaurant.",

    "text": "I heard mixed things about this place but wanted to check it out... I mean, having a duck on a waffle with maple syrup, it's too intriguing not to! I was very lucky to have gotten a booking a few days before the date of choice, because I heard you have to wait at least a month for a good table. Unfortunately one of the lifts was broken, which was the only downside to the experience because being in that lift is pretty amazing. It's completely clear so the view takes your breath away. But this time it was really crowded so didn't get to appreciate the view as much as I could have otherwise. You go to the 40th floor and the staff immediately takes care of you. There's a small bar before the restaurant space but we had a late dinner booking so we went straight to the table to order drinks, which were fabulous. The tables closest to the windows are obviously the best, but unfortunately we were seated close to the kitchen which was farthest away from the view. I didn't mind it though, I enjoyed staring at all the dishes come out.The appetizers are stunning. The garlic bread is a must-have... I've never had garlic bread so deliciously original. Hands-down the best bread I had in my life actually. Soft cloves of garlic nested in the soft bread but wasn't overpowering. The octopus was also really nice with the roasted potatoes, and the doughnut was really interesting! I didn't enjoy the raw scallops though... each piece was way too small and was the most disappointing dish of the evening. Of course, then comes the duck & waffle, and I absolutely loved it! The whole combination worked perfectly together. I poured all the maple syrup over the duck and egg and inhaled the dish. The portion could be bigger. Overall, I can't wait to bring my siblings here, it will really impress them :)",

You must order their duck and waffle menu because it's obviously their signature dish! I was curious at first since the menu was mixing the saltiness (from the duck) and sweetness (from waffle) together but as soon as i had my first bite on it, I knew this was the one. They managed to combine the crispyness of the duck with the spongy texture of the waffle perfectly, the maple syrup and duck egg were the best add-ons to the dish. Everything just worked together perfectly and their was no room for error. Also, my first time ever trying the foie gras here and they matched it with toast and nutella! Not just that, for desserts I had mars bars chocolate but DEEP FRIED ! first time ever and believe me I'm already thinking of going back to dip my chocolate bars in the pan haha. i know it sounds sooo fatty but its always fair enough to treat yourself once in while. Like they said, desserts is stressed spelt backwards ;)",

    "text": "The view is absolutely amazing, which is just as well because if not for the view, they should burn it down and claim on the insurance. Since they're on the 40th floor, there would be collateral damage. We went there for a birthday breakfast that we made a booking for a week ago. When we got there, they had no record of the booking, despite showing them a copy of the email they sent confirming it and noting that it was for a birthday. The hostess / waitress who seated us was really helpful despite no record of the booking and while she was still on shift, service was good. Once she left though, service went downhill fast. We ordered a coffee and an orange juice at one point. The coffee arrived but 15 minutes later there was still no orange juice. Getting the waiter's attention to fix this took ages. Getting that waiter's attention for anything took ages, so we eventually left without the second course we wanted.The food was ok. The menu at 06:00 is pretty limited, but that's expected for a place like this. One meal was good, the other was ok. The egg was overdone to the point that you could bounce it, but I guess that's a small issue in the grand scheme of things. The icing on the cake though was the crust on the vomit that I stepped in when I went to the men's room. I'm not sure how long it takes for vomit to get crusty, but I'm sure it's longer than the gap between bathroom checks for an establishment like this should be. All in all, a very disappointing visit and a bad start to a day of celebration.",

(Note, Sushisamba is on the 38th floor; if you want an exquisite view rather than a middling one, continue riding up!). From our corner of the restaurant, we could make out both the dome of Wembley and the Olympic Village. I ordered the eponymous duck and waffle (which also comes with a sunny side up duck egg and mustard maple syrup). What a combination. The taste was unexpectedly wonderful. The \"Rosemary and Garlic\" is a bread-like appetizer that you really must try. We also got strips of pigs' ears for the table, which were great as a novelty. Speaking of novel tea, I had a fresh mint tea to end the meal--it was a great way to drag out the lunch and enjoy the sunset of London (which probably would have been awesome were it not for the clouds)!",

    "text": "Duck and Waffle? It is, to \u00a0be brief - totally amazing. I hadn't even finished dessert before I had booked to come back twice more - in the same week. Yes, it was that good. Once you've got past the slightly overenthusiastic security on the front door - you enter an express glass lift which whisks you on an ear-popping journey up to the 40th floor. And the views - astonishing. The moment you get past the wierd 'inside out' bar (its in the middle of the room and you have to sort of mill around it) the restaurant opens up to a 360 degree vista of London. Or a vista of, well, Essex, if you're sitting on the wrong side. We, however, were ushered into the best table in the place by the amazingly helpful Gavin, looking right down on the top of the Gherkin and further down onto Tower Bridge and the Tower of London, the lights of Commercial Street snaking away to our left. And the food? Gorgeous. A couple of starters - peas in the pod with a scattering of bacon and a note of sticky eucalyptus. Cod tongues (more likely cheeks) in breadcrumbs with a chunky tartare sauce , bound in a twist of newspaper. For the main course, we shared a delicious rabbit rillettes with beer chutney and flatbread, a fantastic roasted beetroot and goats curd - and of course, the eponymous duck and waffle, a confit leg on top of two chunks of waffle, topped by a fried duck egg and some mustard maple syrup on the side. I neither like duck nor waffles, nor even fried eggs - yet I loved it. Pudding - of course - had to be the chocolate brownie with peanut butter ice cream and melted marshmallow. Let me say that again. Chocolate brownie with peanut butter ice cream and melted marshmallow. The bill - a shade over twenty pounds each. All this with that incredible view, from dusk to night time and the lights of London twinkling far below. Only two more visits? Not enough. Not nearly enough.",

Unfortunately, at best I'd give this a very average rating and I would not be able to, in good faith, recommend this place to anyone1) Service - after asking what the best thing on the menu was I was told everything is great and nothing was worthy of being recommended/standing. out. The gentlemen serving me seemed to be very curt, unfriendly and did not even seem to care about making suggestions based on what I would like. This was truly disappointing.2) The view - a very good view of London from the Heron tower and a wide selection of drinks may mean this is a better place to go for drinks versus food3) The food (and drink) - I cannot believe these people served me what could only be described as \"spinach in boiled water\" which was supposed to be earl grey tea. I have not got high expectations regarding this but since this arrived before my meal it almost tempted me to get up and leave. Extremely disappointed.Fortunately, the steak and eggs benedict was very nice and a very different combination to the usual salmon or ham. I do recommend this is you are in town for breakfast but I cannot recommend the full breakfast which my friend found truly disappointing.Overall 3 stars, come for the view but not the food.",

    "text": "I've had the pleasure of eating here a number of times now and each occasion has been, well, a pleasure!Whilst I love food, I also enjoy the whole experience of eating out and believe the surroundings and service of an establishment are equally important as the food with the proviso that they should also be 'appropriate' for the experience. For example, when in a chain restaurant found in abundance on high streets everywhere, I accept I'm going to receive an anodyne service from a young person, whose enquiry about whether my meal is ok is a repetitively drilled out line borne from corporate training rather than of genuine concern that my ketchup was too runny.The thing is, I really don't mind. It's expected for that type of experience and therefore, anything over and above that expectation is going to get a thumbs up from me, whether it's a Nando's or Michelin experience.Now, my expectation of the D&W was as sky high as the place itself. Having read reviews in the broadsheets about how fabulous and unpretentious the place was, how good the food was, how it's where most working chefs go to relax and eat after finishing their shifts (D&W is a 24hr a day affair) I was almost ready to be disappointed. However, this place excels on all counts. Food - excellent, service - charming and attentive without being intrusive, surroundings - hard pressed to find anything better in London. The food is reasonably priced and less than I expected. The booze is more but probably a reflection of being in the City - I can imagine some suits wouldn't balk at paying a few hundred quid for a bottle of sparkles. Having said that, it was great to see local beer and English wine on the list too, supporting local concerns is also a passion of mine - we had a bottle of English sparkly, that was delicious and worth the cash. You will need to book in advance but do it online, it's not difficult. You can view the menu online too, it all adds to the build up and excitement of going and it's a great experience.",

The duck was tender, but it was missing some flavor. I also did not like the spicy ox cheek doughnut. The jam over powered the whole entire dish. I did really enjoy the foie gras creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, smoked eel, and crispy polenta. I would definitely order those two things again, if I decide to come back! You're basically paying for the elevator ride to the 40th floor and the gorgeous views. The service is also outstanding. Our waiter was very attentive and the whole staff were friendly. It is a great experience to try it once, and enjoy the views and ambiance. Just don't come here with high expectations for their food! Overall, I give it a 3.5 because of the fantastic service and stunning view.",

    "text": "THE BEST meal I've ever had in my life!!On 7/13, I was planning my trip to London which was exactly a month away (8/13). Every food blog about London was recommending this restaurant called Duck & Waffle, so I thought I had to check it out. I went on its site and found out I had to make a reservation (they take reservation up to two months in advance). To my surprise, Duck & Waffle was almost completely booked for a day that was an entire month away!! The only times available were at 7am and 7:30am. I am not a morning person, but I decided to make the commitment and made the reservation for 7:30am of my first full day. The night before the day of my reservation, I was in complete doubt I would wake up early enough to find myself at this restaurant. Miraculously, I woke up and made my way to the restaurant. Duck & Waffle is located on the 40th floor of the Heron Tower. To get up to the restaurant, I had to confirm my booking on the first floor and went through a security check. I also had to toss my water bottle. When I went up the elevator, I was amazed at the astonishing view of London. I was in awe. Perhaps it was early in the morning, I thought that the restaurant was significantly less crowded than I had imagined for a place that was fully booked an entire month in advance. I sat next to the window and enjoyed the view. Here is a description of what I ordered:1. Duck and waffle (\u00a316): I never imagined this combination would make the perfect duo. The duck was perfectly roasted and it literally melted in my mouth. I can not describe in words the palatable sensations I experienced. In New York, an entree like this would cost at least $30, but I was able to experience this quality with a mere \u00a316. I was so impressed. 2. Duck egg en cocotte (\u00a313): While it was not as good as the duck and waffle, this mix of eggs, mushrooms, and truffles also well pleased my mouth. I would highly recommend it as a secondary entree. I was so tempted to order a dessert, but I had plans for high tea a few hours later so I resisted my temptations. I've never experienced anything like Duck & Waffle before and I would book flight tickets to London just so I can relive this incredible discovery. On another evening, I was passing by the restaurant and saw an incredibly long line of people in the chilly evening breeze waiting for a chance to enter this haven. I was tempted to get myself in line, but I had opt out again. -- taste / 5aesthetics / 5vibe / 5service / 5price for quality / 5OVERALL / 5",

I called ahead of time to see if they could take us earlier since our group was hungry and the sever I spoke to let me know I could check in earlier and if they are able to take us they will. We made our way over and we were greeted by Catherine at the check in podium. I mentioned to her that I called regarding my reservation and she was unable to find my name. She rudely asked me to show her my confirmation email. She was still unable to find my reservation and asked what time I made the reservation and my sister chimed in and said \"please look at her email, we have a confirmed reservation\" then she finally let us up but replied \"you may or may not have a reservation but I can let you up\" The check in process with Catherine was horrible, she rolled her eyes and acted as if I didn't make a reservation. That's not what I expected from this place, as I came here 6 months ago for drinks. We let the hostess know the experience we had and they apologized which was appreciated. They sat us near the window and the service was great. Adrian and Manuel were amazing. The duck and waffle was better than I expected, I wasn't a fan of the syrup or waffle but the duck was moist and crispy. We also ordered the whole chicken, which was super moist and tasted amazing!",

And of course when it was time to collect are clearly untouched plates they sent over a different waiter from the one who had served us to that point, a rather snake like approach they I only see deployed by high end ponce shacks that see a lot of underwhelmed customers, and who want to sweep away any negative feedback quickly. \u00a0And may I say that this must have been a particularly sour night for the cheffing and waiting staffs, as two other table within earshot were complaining loudly about the lack of quality and service. \u00a0Of course our second waiter just smiled and scurried away even though we were voicing our genuine concerns about the swill on show. \u00a0A real disappointment from a place I had been looking forward to dining at, it really was revolting food.",

I came here in the evening and with the restaurant being on the 40th floor you'll get a great view of London on your way up. The bar you walk into is amazing in itself. The bartender is in the middle of the floor so seats are along the glass looking out over the city.I came with two friends and we wanted to try as much as possible. We ended up ordering eight dishes and they were all amazing but the highlights were the cornbread and dates wrapped in bacon. They bacon wrapped dates were tender and juicy. The sweetness of the dates and saltiness from the bacon was the perfect balance. The cornbread had a moist texture that came from the maple glaze and a little hint of spice from the jalape\u00f1os that was perfect.Every dish here was amazing so you can't go wrong with any item. I would highly recommend this place and plan on making it here whenever I'm in London.",

Good thing they spend all of their PR money on getting into 'Where to eat in London' articles because you'd be better off at any other local diner and without the condescending attitude from everyone in the place. \u00a0It's a shame the liquor board doesn't know or doesn't care that they serve after hours with that shit attitude. No wonder sushi samba is a joke as well.Place is literally a joke. I've gone a few times as it's a decent drunk after hours spot to have an illegal glass of champagne along with over cooked eggs that were fired an hour ago with hard yolks. But if you have any self respect and don't need to be treated like an undeserving customer by a power tripping door man protecting the elevator for a restaurant with 4 tables sat; save your time. When their lease is out, they'll be gone as they've made the fatal mistake of treating customers like they're lucky to eat there (when they're not even busy) which you'll see is a consistent note in every review. \u00a0Be sure and bring an extra 50 pounds for the sad door guy if you want to eat some waffles. Also - their Head Chef, that even made the place palatable, left in April of this year (2018) so I can't imagine how much further downhill it's gotten.",

It was bustling with hipsters which everyone was enjoying a great meal with a view on the 40th floor of the Heron Tower. We did not have too high of an expectation on the quality of food but it turned out to be surprisingly delicious. The Spring Vegetable Salad with Smoked Mozzarella was super fresh; their signature dish Duck & Waffle was amazingly tasty, the waffle was the best one I ever had; the Smoked Scottish Salmon on Flat Bread was memorable; and their Angus Bone-In Rib-Eye was juicy and cooked to perfection. \u00a0 The best part was taking the floor to ceiling glass elevator down to the ground floor after the meal. It took less than 10 seconds to go from the 40th floor to the ground and you could see the view in 360 degree. We were able to feel the G-Force and it was almost liked a free fall. What an experience!",

They have a dress code and they have security screen you before going up. Did I mention it's located on the 40th floor of 110 Bishopsgate building - one of the taller buildings in London? It's adds to the ambiance and atmosphere. Enjoy the ride up!The menu had some cool options. We of course had to try the duck and waffle - that was my favorite. Crispy and fatty like peking duck and went well with the soft waffle and egg. The spicy ox cheek doughnut was a weird mix of flavors and the dough was pretty hard - too much for me. Enjoyed the rosemary and garlic bread more as a simple starter. Must check this place out at least once!One floor down is another restaurant and bar - go check it out if this one isn't your thing.",

The bar/waiting area was not my favorite vibe, but it was about 30 minutes to seat a party of 6 at 2 a.m. the restaurant area was chill with a beautiful view, the service was charming and exceptional, and the food was something to write home about. We had the spicy waffle, the eponymous duck&waffle, the duck donut, seared squash, and several deserts and cocktails. The vegetarian food was delicious as was the \"surprise me\" mocktail I requested. The rest of my party seemed beyond thrilled with the meat dishes and real cocktails. I'd recommend it as worth a reservation or worth a wait in the douchey bar area if you come looking for a great meal in the middle of the night.",

The most noteworthy dish was (unsurprisingly) the Duck & Waffle - hence name. The duck was so succulent and crispy, the waffle was just right, and the dish was topped with an egg. After we finished that dish, we couldn't resist and ordered another entree of the Duck & Waffle.I dream about that meal from time to time. Needless to say, I have already booked my revisit in my upcoming trip to London and cannot wait to experience it again.",

Discovered in the most unexpected location: Duck & Waffle.The 24-hour restaurant that sits atop the Heron tower just above Sushi Samba. \u00a0It's the \"highest restaurant in London\", sitting on the 40th floor and sharing it's cocktail bar with Sushi Samba below. \u00a0The views are amazing and the clientele and venue are not over-the-top posh, which I like.Their main dish is of course the Duck & Waffle. \u00a0It's composed of a crispy duck confit leg atop a Belgian waffle. \u00a0It's then topped with a fried duck egg and served with mustard maple syrup. \u00a0Indulgent, rich, buttery and perfect any time of day as long as your arteries are in working order!Back to the matter at hand though, the 500g Angus, bone-in ribeye is my new favorite steak in London. \u00a0And I never saw it coming.The Longhorn beef is sourced from Thirsk, in north Yorkshire. \u00a0It's served with a whipped marmite hollandaise sauce, assorted greens and pearl onions, sliced on a sharing platter - and I swear it's got bone marrow in there somewhere! \u00a0My only complaint is that I have to share. \u00a0The beef is juicy and succulent, full of flavor and cooked just right. \u00a0It's quite stunning that a non-beef-centric restaurant has stormed into my favorite steak considering the company Duck & Waffle keeps in the City mile.Other signature dishes include a 'spicy ox cheek donut served with apricot jam and smoked paprika sugar' or the 'foie gras creme brul\u00e9e with buttered roasted lobster and toasted brioche.' \u00a0Also, some cocktails I'd recommend:The Hemmingway - Bacardi Superior rum, maraschino liqueur, lime and grapefruit juices - clarified.The Roasted Cosmo - Grey Goose Le Citron, orange liqueur, roasted bone marrow infusion, cranberry conserve, lime.I go into more detail on my website: beeffanatic.com/2015/02/\u2026",

The place is located at one of the highest if not the highest points in the city, and does offer a good panoramic view, but just remember London doesn't really have a skyline to speak of. We came on a Monday for lunch and had to wait quite a bit for a table even though the place was less than half full. We finally were allowed a table but only \"for an hour.\" And when we asked if we could sit by the window we were told those tables were all reserved. I got the smoked eel and a coffee and my friend the eponymous \"duck and waffle.\" The eel was way to salty for me to savor the actual meat, and the coffee was uncharacteristically strong and bitter. I think my palate was pretty much shut down after finishing the eel since all I wanted was water to douse away the briny taste on my tongue. The prices aren't as high as you'd expect from a high-end London restaurant, so that partially made up for the experience.",

It opens 24 hour, reservation after 10 pm is easy to get. ===MY CONFESSIONS FOR DUCK&WAFFLE BELOW YOU MAY STOP READING===Oh Duck & Waffle, how I missed you. I was living in London for a limited time and while I was there, I wanted to try as many different restaurants as possible. Therefore I rarely go to the same restaurant twice, even if they are good and close to me. I also don't like going to places that's not a direct tube ride away. I've gone out of my way (took a bus and everything) to go to Duck & Waffle 3 times in 3 months. It was well worth it! If I want to take any visitor to a restaurant in London, Duck & Waffle would arguably be my top choice. Why? The view! The hours! The ambiance! The service! The price! And let's not forget about the food! This REALLY is the whole package. View: On the 40th floor of Heron Tower (one of the tallest building in London), the view is incredible. If you want to impress your date, make sure to get one of the tables by the window(there are many of those). With the tower bridge, the tower of London, and the city under your feet, it's hard to find a better view.Hours:24 x 7. In London. That's what I'm talking about.Always make a reservation before you go. It's very busy during normal meal hours, but if you are night owl like me, a table is always available at midnight. There should be more places like this...everywhere! Ambiance: It's one of those places that manages to provide an exquisite dining experience without making you feel intimidated. Low soft light, spacious, trendy decor, lively crowd, perfect.  Service:Absolutely delightful. All 3 times the service has been attentive, efficient, and super friendly. Price: Is a place like this going to cost an arm and a leg you asked? I've had some shockingly expensive meals in London, and this place certainly doesn't look cheap. But you will be surprised. For a dinner with appetizers, a main course and a drink it costs about \u00a0\u00a345 per person. To put it in context, it is cheaper than an afternoon tea in the Dorchester Hotel.Food:Finally it comes to the food. Here are the things I've tried:- carlingford rock oysters: You can never go wrong with some fresh oysters. They make me happy.- bbq-spiced crispy pig ears: So wonderful that I couldn't stop eating them. My friend had to hide it from me or I'd be stuffed before the main courses. \u00a0It came in a brown paper bag with a duck & waffle seal, which was a lovely touch.- spicy ox cheek doughnut: I was quite full when I tried this so I'm not sure if I could do it justice. It was interesting and original, but I don't think it's my thing. The apricot jam was tasty though.- foie gras cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e: I felt obligated to order foie gras since it's no longer legal in California. It was delicious, creamy, smooth, perfect with some dark rye bread. It's a bit heavy for an appetizer for two people, may be better to share with 3 or 4.- duck & waffle: If you go to a restaurant that's named after one of its dishes, you order that dish. You'd be glad to follow this rule here at duck & waffle. The duck leg is so crispy on the outside and so juicy inside. The portion is perfect for sharing between 2.- smoked scottish salmon: The portion is big! It may not stand out as much as the other dishes but it's still very tasty. The cocktail options are excellent as well. Duck & Waffle is stylish but not pretentious, creative and delicious, reasonable priced for such high quality, and there are always window seats available after midnight ;) I'd go back there in a heartbeat if it's not 11-hour flight away.",

I heard it was popular but I assumed 1 person this early shouldn't be too hard to accommodate. Well I was wrong. Luckily the staff could see tis lonely American solo traveler was desperate to get her hands on some good eats and they said they could double check for me. After a few minutes, a hostess appeared, took my jacket to the coat check and said they'd be happy to accommodate me if I promised to stay no longer than 40 minutes as to not ruin their reservation schedule. I said, \"deal!\"Service was lovely. Never felt like they were annoyed at me in any sense, even though I crashed the party basically. I started with a personal pot of coffee for 4 pounds. Delicious coffee with a container of steamed/frothy milk (I was impressed). Of course I had to get the duck and waffle (I mean that's what the place is named after!) It was 15 pounds. Crisp half waffle with a fried duck leg and topped with a perfect sunny side up egg that is lightly sprinkled with coarse sea salt. On the side is the maple syrup mixed with mustard seeds. Usually I am a freak about keeping my eggs away from my syrup (i know I'm weird) but this meal is meant to be eaten with a little bit of each part in every bite. Oh and the views! From the 40th floor in the Heron Tower you have perfect views of London's overcast skyline. Also, did I mention that I am 99% positive that JK Rowling was at a table next to me?!? I tried to snap a secret photo but she caught me staring...whoops.",

But it's London, right?Duck and Waffle was right across from our hotel in London and I'd been reading all about it in Time Out, foodie blogs and twitter, so it was a must-do on my list while visiting my favourite city. The restaurant is open 24/7 and the menu is highly flexible, so you can choose if you'd like just a taste or a full meal. It's hard to get a table in the main dining room without a reservation. It's not too hard to walk in to get a small bar table with service on a weeknight, however. Cocktails were strong and delicious. What took the cake was the SPICY OX CHEEK DOUGHNUTS. Without a doubt, one of the best creative bar food concoctions I've ever tried. I didn't try the signature dish (ie duck and waffles) but I saw it being passed off to the table next door and felt my heart drop. Will have to order next time! Several months later, we're still talking about Duck and Waffle. It's a little trendier than the Shard and slightly less stuffy too. Check it out.",

    "text": "I often stick a lot of background detail into my reviews just for fun, but in this case it might be more useful than usual. Because if you're thinking about this place on the spur of the moment, then I'll warn you to think again. Unless it's the wee small hours of the morning, then hallelujah it's the answer to your prayers for something in London to be open at this time! Otherwise you need to book in advance, and if it falls into 'normal mealtimes' then you needed to make a reservation a month ago.I was planning a girly brunch before heading off to work in Edinburgh for a few weeks, and with 3 weeks' notice the only time left on a Saturday morning for 6 people was 8.30am. Not ideal, but we took it. The hype about this place was enough for my girls to gallantly get out of bed earlier than they would for work - I was definitely feeling the love :)The other thing to mention is that a booking is not a booking unless you reconfirm with them or their answering machine at least a day before - they'll call you a couple of days in advance to check this. You've been warned.The morning itself started grey and miserable, and we were grateful to get inside anywhere let alone the awesome lift ride to the 40th floor here. As with Sushisamba that whoosh of an entrance is guaranteed to impress (or at least leave you a bit wobbly at the top). A few twisting turning tiled corridors later, past the bar and views down onto the gherkin, and we were seated by the floor-to-ceiling windows on the north side.Thankfully (and before the girls could complain) the clouds soon cleared up and we got some gorgeous views outside - I'm a sucker for being at height (not just my 6ft frame I mean). It's the views that really sell the place looks-wise as I wasn't sure what the d\u00e9cor was saying - the tiles in the corridor suggest something Mediterranean but the dining room itself is quite plain and unfussy, with wooden tables along the windows and booths in the centre.My mate had made the mistake of looking at the brunch menu online, but at 8.30am that was a bit of a stretch and we were handed slightly more restricted breakfast menus instead. It was a bit disappointing for my 4 veggie mates to find they couldn't get a veg version of the full english on the menu - I hadn't checked veg choices in advance as I'd just assumed they'd be covered at brunch. A couple got the Colombian Eggs with me - avocado and organic eggs on sourdough toast. I got the eggs scrambled and added chorizo on top; it was yum but boy I could still taste that chorizo hours later!Others resorted to building their own breakfast from the sides - toast, hash browns, mushrooms etc, which all came out beautifully presented. After round one I had a tasty latte and we got waffles to share - by then it was late enough to pick from the brunch menu. We had one with honey-glazed banana and nutella, and one with poached rhubarb and honeycomb (both with ice cream obv). I knew I'd like the first one, but unexpectedly think I preferred the second - not sure what they did to it but rhubarb didn't taste this good the last time I tried it!The service is stressed but smiley at the door, whilst the waiters were attentive in refilling tap water but not what I'd call warm. The ordering process was more of a struggle than it needed to be as he didn't seem to understand 'vegetarian' and tried to get everyone to add salmon or chorizo to their dishes. Still I did like the little touch of noting who ordered what, so they could bring the food straight out to each person without asking whose dish it was.I think I was expecting a little more from the food as it's pricey for what you get, but I guess that's not a surprise in this setting. I wouldn't rush back for brunch but I'd like to try it at a different part of the day. Get your diary out and plan a visit if you haven't then, but use it wisely - whether it's on your special someone, or your mom (or maybe your mom is your special someone), or a guest from abroad. Just be ready to catch them when they totter out that lift!",

Because the bouncer had his head up his behind and wouldn't let me in to get a coffee because of my trainers (which are squeaky clean and have had numerous compliments, but which I also have to wear at the moment because of an injury on my Achilles' tendon). When I pointed out someone else he has let in wearing trainers he responded that it was ok because they had a reservation. Then he started telling me it takes a month to get a reservation and this has been the policy since they opened and I should check the website and all the other stuff you don't want to hear when someone on a silly power trip has denied you access to your favourite place in London and ignored your foot injury (not that the injury should matter).This was one of my favourite places in London but I'm not going there again unless I get an apology.It's 2015 guys. Nobody else cares what shoes I'm wearing, so what difference does it make to you?",

The food is excellent, the service is impeccable (though with that London snobbish feel you come to expect around the area - shout out to the two jaunty club-style bouncers at the entrance downstairs) \u00a0It's not cheap but it's not prohibitively expensive either. Another weird highlight - the lift. It reminded me of Roald Dahl's Charlie & The Glass Elevator. It's on the outside of the building and gives you an ear-popping, wholly dizzying ride right to the top. Don't look down. (Or do, you dare devil you!!)As previous reviewers have said, make sure you book well in advance (as in, at least a month or two), or you're unlikely to get a normal eating hour.

I asked for the optional 12.5% service charge to be removed from the bill and my server, who must have known he was being rude in the first place, wanted to interrogate me about what was bad with the service.

Maybe the desserts, but who needs dessert when you have duck and waffles. I came back with friends at 2:30 in the morning for reasons I won't go into here. I just want to go up and down in that lift swooshing through London with empty streets and glittering lights. I totally would if the doorman didn't look so capable at cracking jaws. The restaurant was virtually deserted besides a large man with a classy e-cigar, guffawing and talking constantly while a coterie of his \"model friends\" ate very little and laughed airily.We got the corner table with the best views in the house. It was a \"I'm flying Jack\" moment. *Cries a little*. We shared a duck and waffle, and a paper packet of crispy BBQ pigs ears, which came out within 5 minutes. The combination of flavours and textures is just so perfect. The mix between sweet and savoury is ace. If we were hungrier and it wasn't the middle of the night I'd have gotten the ox-cheek doughnut because that is sensational. I wish there was an option to pay a bit extra for a waiter to cut and assemble each mouthful, because even though it is so delicious the allocation of flavours can become quite hard work. This would definitely tip the decadence barometer over the edge though. This must be the only place where I want exactly the same things. I'm sure the other dishes are great and everything but who cares at all when there is duck and waffle. London at night is something else, seeing buildings you know so well from above, sparkling like little toys. Plus the hand cream in the bathrooms smells lovely. There's no snobby veneer of exclusivity, just amazing food in an amazing setting.",

Great for any time of the day brunch lunch or dinner. Better value for money than sushi samba down one floor below. If u can't get a reservation definitely try to go and have a drink at the bar the view and interior is well worth it",

Wasn't that impressed with the overall decor of the restaurant, one of the views is ruined by a large (and a bit tacky) hanging decoration thing.Nit picking aside I wish I could eat duck and waffles everyday! It was amazing. Weirdly though this dish is under the section for dishes to share, I'm not one for sharing my food and it's not served in away suitable for sharing. The brunch options sounded very good. A bit gutted the ox cheek doughnuts had run out by the time we ordered. Being a greedy guts I was the only one to have a pud (yes I know I came for brunch). I chose a rhubarb baked Alaska, incredibly pretty and delicious. Cocktails are on the expensive side, but then you're paying for the view.As much as loved the duck and waffle I won't rush back.",

    "text": "Had duck and waffle at the Duck & Waffle. This was my first time going to such a talked-about restaurant with my friends and I really loved the place! First off, the journey up to the restaurant was spectacular. The lift goes up at high-speed and you can notice the quick change in pressure with your ears. Perhaps I was already so used with slow lifts that I had to wait ages for, the experience was amazing. (haha I'm so easily contented)Anyway, I loved the Duck and Waffle dish that I ordered. I had a grande-sized Caramel Macchiato an hour ago from Starbucks so I couldn't really stomach anything else. Although it was probably my first time eating such a strange combination of food together but despite the strangeness, the food was delicious! I loved how crispy and succulent the duck confit was and although the waffle and duck egg were merely satisfactory, the duck confit more than made up for it. The mustard maple syrup wasn't too sweet and good enough for my tastes. Loved the service in this restaurant. Although we were bunch of cheapskates and ordered only tap water, we received no grudge and our glasses were consistently filled, table cleared and wiped off of any noticeable dirt (although it's something trivial, it's not a gesture practised by a lot of restaurants). So a big thank you to the waiter in charge of our table for such a great service - this is the first time whereby i gladly paid the 12.5% charged to the bill. The only downside of this entire dining experience was the view. It was foggy tonight so there wasn't much to see and the sky was still bright so no night lights either. Will definitely come back to this lovely place at a better time. Till then! :)",

    "text": "If you'd like to eat during \"normal\" hours you're going to have to do some up-front planning and book a reservation months in advance however, there's clearly a good reason for that--this place is fantastic. If you can swing a table next to the windows overlooking the city your group/date will think you're a hero. The outside bar just two floors down is a perfect spot to start your night with a cold drink and an amazing view of London. If you've got a reservation at the restaurant you can bypass the queue for the elevator. Another reason for doing so. The plates are perfect for sharing so it's best to just go HAM and order a flurry of starters and main plates to enjoy with your table. The Duck and Waffle is a must. Pig ears are not my thing, generally, but give these a try and you'll probably be as surprised as I was. Oxcheek filled doughnut...YES! For those who have been to Sugarcane in Miami this place is just as good. The service was good. The food comes out as and when it's ready so you experience waves of deliciousness. The bar just outside the restaurant has an interesting open format concept. An after dinner drink might be worth it \u00a0Prices are a bit rough so be prepared. A good value when considering the views of London, the quality of the food, and the atmosphere. Sometimes you just have to spend the money anyway so go for it!",

After being whisked up the glass elevator, you're thrown into a modern and clean restaurant with views all around you. A really nice stocked bar, where the gin and tonics really work!We had a small table for three and the staff made every effort to sit us down with the best view. It was amazing, although probably not one for anyone who doesn't like heights. We all went straight for the duck and waffle (you've got to really) and what a weird but beautiful plate of food. There's something new and exciting about the crisp and sweet waffle with a tender chunk of duck meat. The dish was served with a sweet maple mustard sauce and it probably lasted all of 4 minutes. It was too good not to keep digging in. We only went for the meal and left to keep exploring the bar, but both the starters and desserts looked incredible. Certainly one to keep in mind with Christmas approaching!!",

Like a homeless person! So shabby chic. Although, I don't think any homeless person has stunning views of london like duck and waffle does. So, duck and waffle is KIND of like tapas, but not really tapas. We tried everything from goat cheese, to rabbit, to octopus, to an oxcheek donut, and not forgetting the signature duck and waffle. Sounds a bit like YGO's extreme eating adventures now. Actually, we didn't order the octopus, but i said oxcheek and that sounded like octopus. So that's a gauge on how noisy it can get. I LOVED the rabbit, it was quite possibly my favourite dish of the night and it easily trumped the signature dish, because I don't think duck and maple syrup work. I like duck, I like maple syrup, smush them together, ehhh, doesn't do anything for me. We also got a rice pudding dish, that tasted \u00a0bit like thouse free ones I get from the turkish restaurants in haringay. and the ones in haringay tastes a bit better. A great place to take guests to show them London and also we saw Matt Groening!",

    "text": "Duck & Waffle is unique, extraordinary.. but also slightly overpriced.The uniqueness? Its 40th floor location and those views. They claim to be the highest restaurant in the country, at exactly 200m off the ground, and I can believe them. Quite simply it's like nothing else in London (or indeed the rest of the country). The smooth ascent (or descent) by lift is quite a thrill, and as a result, either the stylish bar or restaurant has to be a great place to impress someone, say on a date.Also extraordinary about it is its 24 hour nature. I'm a big fan of that, and hitherto coming here, the only 24 hour London restaurant I knew of was Vingt Quatre in Fulham. Needless to say, Duck & Waffle is far superior experience.The service is excellent too. Quick, responsive and very helpful with last-minute requests. My girlfriend's birthday was due a few days after I swung by with fellow Yelpers as part of the Classy Christmas Crawl (full credit here to the mighty Andrew M) and I wondered if it was possible to surprise her with a lit candle on a small dessert plate. No problem at all they replied and out came the plate just as we were preparing to pay the bill. Result: a hearty group rendition of 'happy birthday' and one delighted girlfriend.The food however, though good, is rather overpriced. I had to go for the signature Duck and Waffle dish, partly due to its eponymous nature but also because I'm a massive fan/glutton of waffles. It sounds great, and it was good, but consisting of Duck leg on waffle with grain mustard maple syrup for \u00a317, really it's just a rather expensive, posher version of bacon on waffles or pancakes with maple syrup, and in a smaller quantity too. The dessert waffles are also pricey: at \u00a38.50, they're the most expensive I've seen. That said, the other dishes opted for by the rest of the group did look interesting and as the waiter said, given that we were eating (literally) into the early hours, the menu was more restricted than usual.I do wonder a bit what market D&W is aiming for. Its 200 metre elevation gives it a huge advantage over competitors such as Galvin at Windows or the Oxo Tower, so in some ways I'm surprised that they haven't upped the ante by going for haute cuisine outright. Maybe it does during the day, but that's certainly not the impression I get.Still, Duck and Waffle is extraordinary, unique and 100% worth checking out, whichever hour of the 24 you find yourself in the area.",

    "text": "Ordered: Duck and Waffle, Cripsy Pig earsPrice: ~\u00a325Review: The herd effect had a slightly larger impact on my view of Duck&Waffle. Not a bad place to eat, with a great view, but lets be serious here. Who eats an overpriced duck and waffle, and crispy pig ears for \u00a325, and still feels ridiculously hungry afterwards. Am I the piggy or is it the portions? The Crispy Pig ears are fantastic - worth the taste FOR SURE. The Duck and Waffle itself - tasty, but really, is it really all that? I've tasted better in nyc for sure. Give Duck and Waffle a shot, but don't expect magical ducks and magical waffles :)",

The view from the window seats looked spectacular but we were seated in the center. Most of the window seats were for 2 people.What prevented the 5 star review for me was our experience with the 2 doormen the first time we arrived. When we inquired about eating there, we were informed rather coldly that advanced reservations would be required. I didn't mind being told about the reservations but the tone and demeanor was definitely not acceptable. We almost didn't book a reservation.",

If you can get a table--and they aren't easy to pick up on short notice--make sure to try a number of the easy to share dishes. But, most importantly tuck into the eponymous signature plate, or two.Cocktails and wine are on the pricey end, so imbibing will lift you out of the reasonably affordable range to the questionably costly. Though, when you're atop the City you'll likely want to be toasting to high life.",

    "text": "I'd heard so many good things about Duck & Waffle, so naturally I was super excited to try out the food! \u00a0Getting to the actual restaurant was pretty fun, the fastest elevator I've been on to get to the 40th floor, felt a bit like being in Willy Wonka's Glass Elevator! \u00a0And the views of London were absolutely stunning! \u00a0We were seated pretty quickly and I went for dinner in quite a large group, about 10 of us. \u00a0I was sat at the end of the table so it was easier for me to talk to the waiter on behalf of the group. \u00a0I took a look at the menu and asked whether we ordered lots of plates to share like tapas or a dish each. \u00a0This waiter was the rudest, snootiest man and literally sighed at me when I asked this question and just replied \"If none of you have eaten here before it will just be best to tell you all when you're paying attention\". \u00a0Wow. \u00a0Just wow. \u00a0I didn't think that was much a difficult question. \u00a0If I was rude myself I could understand his reaction, but I wasn't. \u00a0The waiter had ruined the excitement for me completely, but hey, he was serving us so I was still going to be British about it and be polite.We eventually ordered the food which took a fairly long time to come out. \u00a0To be completely honest, I wasn't that impressed. \u00a0The signature 'Duck and Waffle' was pretty darned good, but I found the rest of the food a bit meh. \u00a0This place definitely has it's attractions - quirky food, amazing views and a decent reputation. \u00a0I wasn't overly impressed though, I personally felt everything was a bit overpriced. \u00a0It was an experience to eat here but I don't think I'll be rushing back any time soon.",

    "text": "It's a bit of a posh place - you'll need to be dressed well enough to get past the guardians of the ground floor - but with a relaxed atmosphere. Naturally, you've got to get the duck & waffle. Now I'd always try out a signature dish (it's the best of the menu, right?) but in this case I'd keep going back for it no matter what. I admit, I was sceptical when I first heard of this upscale version of the southern comfort food, but damn they do it well here. The duck confit is all tender juicy flesh with crispy skin and the waffle is perfectly cooked with a sharp crunchy crust with a fluffy interior that drinks in the accompanying maple syrup. The combination of sweet waffle and savoury duck is a brilliant mix that I'd go for every time. And there is something about waffles that draws your inner child out to play and conjures up fond memories of Eggo toaster waffles.We also tried the crispy fried pig ears which are a great snack - something different for munching on while watching the game and I'm thinking I may make some for my next poker night. And while we're on alternative foods, I also had the dossant a couple of weeks ago when I ran the first cronut crawl. D&W's dossants look for all intents and purposes like deep fried croissants split in half and stuffed with fresh cream. And as far as I can tell, that's just what they are. \u00a36 gets you a pair of small croissant-shaped flaky pastries with a fresh light and slightly lemony flavoured cream. A bit pricey, but then again D&W is a bit on the nicer side of things so not wholly unexpected.However, I think they are missing a beat here as while the croissant was represented in full, there was barely any soft fluffy doughnut in evidence. Really, Mr Doughnut has to take a look and wonder if that really is his kid...Granted, at this point we'd had more than our fair share of drinks but the bar is pretty hard to resist. I opted for a Sazerac which was perfectly balanced and deadly in potency. It's easy to drink, doesn't taste of booze (beyond the flavour of whiskey), and sweet enough to be moreish. A very dangerous yet delicious combination!At \u00a317, the duck & waffle is a pricey option but worth it as a treat. The pig ears were \u00a35 and an excellent value snack. I'll have to come back at a more reasonable time to test out the rest of the menu but all in all you are looking at something that's good for a treat once in a while but a bit too much for a regular stop. Unless of course you are a city boy/girl in which case I'm free to join you for dinner if you are paying!",

At 9am it wasn't too busy so we got a great table near a window (but not next to it) and could move about easily to take photos. The food itself was great, just wish there was more of it (coming from an American who's used to large portions). My boyfriend had the banana ice cream waffle and a side of organic eggs which were also delicious.",

My boyfriend who never ever complains who always says the food is delicious this time could not contain himself when the waiter asked why we hadn't finished the ravioli that later was very gracious and asked for his opinion which my boyfriend gave which is something we don't normally do because at that point there isn't really much to be done. My boyfriend goes to restaurants and is in the business and understands that mistakes are made and sometimes food goes out cold or taste bad and that's just what happens it's what happened after that that does not make me want to ever go back there again for the next 20 minutes I counted 15 staff members ignoring us not filling water not bringing us a check, not checking in we just wanted to leave the food was delicious and the beginning of the service was great but the end wasn't so great and we just wanted to leave and it was near impossible to get somebody to look our way to get a bill to pay for the food I don't think I go back unfortunately because of the way they handled at the end not because of the food. Restaurant send out bad food that just happens I don't blame them for that I do blame them for not paying attention to us we weren't being of noxious the waiter who would come to the table to ask about the ravioli really really wanted to know why we hadn't eaten it and in very short descriptive terms my boyfriend told him in a very nice way we weren't trying to be picky we weren't trying to get free food we were just honestly answering his question",

    "text": "My friend had asked for a table by the window when she booked, when the booking was confirmed and when we called to say we were stuck in traffic so we were pretty excited to have a delightful booth overlooking east London. It's our friend's birthday! she yelled. I've been wanting to come here for 2 years, I screeched! The host looked suitably afraid at that point. But why worry? The view is incredible, the service is outstanding and everything I ate was also outstanding.We ordered 4 small plates: pollock meatballs with a sumptuous lobster cream, tasty bacon wrapped dates and spicy ox cheek doughnut and, the stand out for me, coal charred aubergine. I love aubergine and this is one of the best aubergine dishes I have ever had - the balance of the cumin and yoghurt was perfect.Next up was duck and waffle. This exceeded my expectations and should be obligatory to try. We also shared one tartiflette, especially decadent on my part because I'd had 1.5 Kappacasein cheese sandwiches for lunch (although we didn't eat till 10pm and want on a walk london Pepys/Wren tour in the meantime, so sue me). It had a much stronger flavour than other tartiflette I've tried - not in a bad way - and now on reviewing the menu I see this was due to the involvement of truffles. Ah, truffles. YES.By this time I was pretty drunk on whatever delicious tipple my Wine Society friend had been plying us with so entered Natalie-Luxe mode in which I start ordering whatever I want AND HANG THE EXPENSE. Turns out what I wanted was a pistachio macaroon with chocolate mousse, and a bacon & caramel Manhattan.The macaroon was impressively large, a little chewy for my tastes but the chocolate mousse was sublime. Also sublime was the cocktail, picked from an immensely appealing menu (Aqua Shard, take note). About the smoothest drink I've ever had with the salty bacon flavour perfectly off-setting the sweet caramel. Quality.It's pretty nice to go somewhere you have been excited about for a long time and find that it not only exceeds your expectations but blows them out of the water. I hope it wasn't just a fluke, because I would like to come back here again and again and enjoy the same amazing food and absolutely stellar service which was so attentive, friendly, helpful and efficient we must have remarked upon it at least a dozen times throughout the course of the evening.I was bracing myself for the bill but it came in somewhere around \u00a365 which I was happy to pay for one of the best meals out I've had in ages. Duck & Waffle is as good as it gets, and gets my 500th review and five very shiny stars.",

It's unique, with amazing views, good service, great drinks and brilliant food!The Menu is great, as one I first looked at it I thought 'What the hell is this', but when we got there and I began working my way through it, everything I had was lovely! The highlights include...Bacon wrapped dates-We thought 'why not' when we ordered these, but they were so good we ordered some more with our mains!Crispy Pigs Ears-Get one, share the bag, great to snack on whilst you wait/talk and enjoyNduja bread...this is one of the best things of all time, again we ordered another one later on as this one was demolished pretty quickly. it's like soft pizza dough with a spicy (Nduja) sauce, and it's just amazing. Then we get to the small plates...all of these are really good, but our favourites include the Octopus and Chorizo, Meatball and Beef Tatare. Hands down the best thing on this list is the Ox Cheek Doughnut...it's so wrong but tastes so right!For the table...it's got to be the duck and waffle! The duck is sometimes a little dry, but this dish is still great. One between two is about right! I would focus on the small plates, and then maybe just 1 or 2 at a push of the larger ones. Try as much as you can and take in the stunning views whilst you do it.Drinks wise, I am ashamed to admit...it's all about the Roasted Cosmo!Enjoy!",

I ended up heading here with some friends after a night out at about 3 a.m., and there was a short queue (about 15 minutes) to get in. Duck & Waffle is open 24/7 so if you didn't make a reservation I recommend going late at night or super early for breakfast at sunrise! Once you enter the building, you get on a reaallly fast lift that takes you directly up to the restaurant, which is on the 40th floor. The decor is an eclectic and interesting mix of old and new: blue and white tiles in the entrance, a cluster of posh chandeliers hanging over the staircase, and some modern urban artwork around the bar area. Of course, what really makes the restaurant spectacular is its view of the city, and most notably the bullet building. We sat at a table next to floor to ceiling windows and it took me a minute to get used to the height! I ordered a savory dish and a sweet dish - the duck egg with truffles and toast soldiers and the banana dessert waffles. The food was amazing and if it hadn't been 4 a.m. I would've wanted to stay for hours ordering everything on the menu! Also, the prices were fairly reasonable! Most dishes were around \u00a310 to \u00a320. The only downside to my experience here was that the bar had just closed so I didn't get to try any of their famous cocktails. Next time I'm in London, I will definitely be back!",

Watching London simultaneously fade away beneath your feet and open up as your view expands across the whole city is something really special. As we arrived at floor 40 it felt like we'd turned the wrong way somewhere. We hadn't. You do just have to walk past the toilets to get to the restaurant. We were seated straight away. You know that feeling where you're mentally counting off where they could sit you? \u00a0As the waiter kept walking I began to hope we were going to get the corner table. I internally leaped for joy as he stopped there, giving us views on two sides, one down onto the gherkin and one across east London to where I live. Perfect. The menu was a little confusing and although we were offered guidance we were far too British to actually accept it. There were sides, \"for the table\", and small plates. We decided to buy a mixture of things and share which is easy for a couple but might make things a bit harder in a group. The ox cheek donut smelt warm and comforting, and was my boyfriend's favourite part of the meal. I preferred the lamb, which was dry and crunchy, served in strips, with a gooseberry sauce. We also had the duck and waffle which was nice but the waffle was a little dry for me, though the duck was sweet and sublime. For dessert we went for the baked Alaska. I was excited because I've never had a real one of these and a little disappointed when they cheated by serving ice cream coated in American marshmallow fluff. One day I'll find an authentic one! Including service and a cocktail each the bill came to \u00a3100.Despite a few little niggles, eating at the Duck and Waffle was absolutely worth the extra cost and effort making a reservation. Indeed, we've decided to cut down on our Byron habit so we can save up to eat here again!",

Duck & Waffle needs no introduction at this point, so I'll just review it to stick it on my \"to visit\" list for anybody I can send my reviews to. It's modern fusion cooking with a magnificent mostly-all-around view, and years after the launch it is still packed on weekdays. Only minor downside is the hard surfaces everywhere in the room make it very echo-prone and loud. This is perhaps by design to allow the numerous bankers to conduct their affairs in peace but a few carpets here and there might attenuate the whole thing below uncomfortable levels.Friendly competent service as can be expected. Fast, too, since they need that table turnaround for volume considering their price point.The dress code does not seem to be enforced as numerous patrons wore trainers and aside from aforementioned bankers most men also wore collarless shirts or T-shirts.",

Had the Apple Pie & Rye cocktail, which was inventive like crazy as it was served as a clear liquid with a cucumber slice...but was made of rye and tasted like apples. Here's the description per the menu:\"Clarified rye whiskey, St. Germain, distilled apple pie, cucumber bitters. Carbonated.\"Wow. So, anyway...For food I had the Bacon-wrapped date (tremendous...shoulda gotten 2), the Toffee Apple Waffle (hot damn), and some famous bbq-spiced crispy pigs ears. Those came out smelling real nice and were good on the first bite but honestly the texture just didn't do it for me after that. Still, I brought the bag home with the leftovers and will end up finishing them during my week in London. Not wanting the meal to end, I extended the meal with a special treat - a pour of the going-extinct Hibiki 17 Year Japanese whisky. It was pricy, but may be my only chance to drink that in my lifetime. It was also a decent size pour (2 shots), and may be the only dime I spend on food my entire time in London. So pretty easy to justify!So I know reservations are nearly impossible to get here, but give it a try on an off-hour (like 9:30pm Sunday night) and you'll definitely be able to get a seat in the bar area as groups make their way to the dining room. The bar menu isn't the largest, but has enough to get a feel for the place in a more informal way.",

    "text": "Like the name suggests, Duck and Waffle is famous for one dish - Duck & Waffle. Looking at the menu, it was on the pricey side ($34 NZD), so I went for the Porridge with maple pecans, toasted seeds and banana and\u00a0a pot of English Breakfast tea, while my Mum ordered the Poached Eggs on Sourdough Toast with hand churned butter. I loved the presentation of the Porridge and it tasted heavenly.But, the best part about dining at Duck and Waffle? The view. Located in the Heron Tower\u00a0(one of the largest buildings in London) and situated on the 40th floor, the views from where you sit are incredible.\u00a0 \u00a0Duck and Waffle is one of those places I would visit just for the experience - dining up high, looking out over the spectacular views. However, next time, I would come back for a morning coffee or a drink after work, as I believe it is too pricey for what it is worth.",

Arriving, I was surprised to have to walk down a dark hall past the restrooms to get to the host--and then that the host asked our party to wait more than fifteen minutes for a reserved table (offering neither bar seats nor an apology). Once seated, we noticed several empty tables that could easily have held our group, none of which were ever seated during the hour or two while we ate. As for the food, the eponymous dish is pricey and unremarkable. But I'd return for the gooey bacon- wrapped dates or the fresh burrata--though it's hard to get either of those wrong.",

And since it's on the 40th floor of a building near the Shard, we figured this is actually a better value than paying to go up to the Shard because we will also get to enjoy a meal here!Once you get to the restaurant, you are kindly asked to wait at the bar/ waiting area where you can grab a drink and start enjoying the view while they get your table ready. We enjoyed the view of London and took a couple snaps before we entered the dining area. We didn't get a table by the window as they were already all taken, but we got seated as close as we can and were still able to enjoy the view. We both ordered the duck and waffles...well since the restaurant is called duck and waffles, this would probably be the item to order and we were right! The duck leg was juicy and tender which was a nice surprise and complimented the waffles perfectly! My boyfriend was impressed with the meal I planned. Before we left, one of the tables by the window opened up and we were able to grab a quick snap at that table before heading out. Staff were friendly. Overall great experience and I would recommend it to anyone visiting London and wants a good meal with a good view!",

We ordered three things: the tartar, the rabbit dish, and obviously the signature Duck and Waffle dish.Tip: don't forget to bring your id because they id you at the building entrance Reservation: necessaryAesthetics:The decor for the restaurant was classy/fancy. We were lucky to get a table by the window. From there you can see a view of London.Service: We were running late by 30 minutes but they were professional and hospitable and still took us to our seat. They didn't rush us at all. Make sure to be courteous though and call to let them know.Wine & Dine: I've only had tartar one other time so I'm not an expert but if I had to describe the tartar here it didn't feel weird or slimy that I was eating raw meat. The meat was seasoned well. My boyfriend in particular really enjoyed the rabbit. Some parts of it were bitter and he liked it. If you're into that I'd recommend it. My personal favorite and to die for was the duck and waffle. I could go on and on about this dish. I was almost sad that I had to share it. The syrup was what especially made the dish amazing. I'm pretty sure they made it there I've never had syrup like it!",

    "text": "Massively overrated, but I'd recommend coming here if the view is what you're after. Located on the 40th floor, Duck and Waffle provides one of the best views of London for dining.Reservations seem to book up pretty quickly, as it was all full when I looked about 2 weeks in advance. However, my credit card company was easily able to make a reservation on my behalf for lunch, as well as request a window seat for the best view. My friend and I arrived at about 12:50pm, 10 minutes early for our reservation. They asked us to wait at the bar area and provided us a drink menu. I considered getting a drink but this month all their special cocktails featured vegetables and I HATE VEGETALS so no thanks. We stood around for about 15 minutes, and at 1:07 I asked if the table was ready yet. The person responded with an incredulous \"no?!?!!?\". Of course I was surprised, as the reservation was for 1pm, so you would exactly the table to be ready at 1, not 1:09. For a restaurant that obsesses over time (they give you approximately a 90 minute time interval for your time at the dining table), you'd think the table would be ready on time. Maybe it was because we weren't dressed in suits like many of the business people lunching here (their dress code is \"smart casual\" which as you know means nothing), but I respected their wishes by not wearing shorts, and had a button down on.Anyway, we were eventually lead to our window side table, and the view was... ok. Not exactly sure what you're supposed to be looking for in the London skyline, but I do admit there is a charm in dining hundreds of feet in the air, and the view of the buildings is kinda cool (def better than looking into a street of traffic for sure!).We opted for the ox cheek doughnut, the br\u00fbl\u00e9e foie gras, and the croquettes. The ox cheek doughnut was pretty pleasant, and it was fun to split it open to review the steaming hot ox cheek inside. It paired nicely with the sauce underneath, but I do think the crust of the doughnut was a tad bit too sweet from the sugar. The foie gras was my least favorite dish. It was yet another play on sweet and savory, but it fell short on the savory side. It was hard to taste the foie through the caramelization on top. The bread that came with it was delicious, but again, the sweetness of the bread overwhelmed the savoriness and richness of the foie. If you didn't tell me there was foie, I would be convinced it was just egg!The croquettes were really nice - super crispy and fluffy on the inside, and the cream it sat on complemented the flavors, while also cutting through the deep fried ball. I highly recommend a few of these per person.We both opted to get the duck and waffle as it is their signature dish. I decided to try the green tea pairing with the waffle. At \u00a36 it's quite expensive, but I did get a whole pot of tea with it. The tea itself was okay, but it wasn't a good quality green tea. As for how it PAIRED with the duck and waffle was completely lost on me. I guess they wanted a bitter tea to contrast with the again sweet and savory duck and waffle but it didn't really work. The duck itself was nicely cooked, and had a great sear on the skin. It fell off the bone, and the meat was super tender and juicy. The waffle itself was okay- it's a bit on the harder side, but it's necessary to soak up the syrup without falling apart. While the fried duck egg was a nice touch , I don't think it actually did anything for the dish in terms of flavor or texture. I love popping yolks as much as anyone else but the dish as the whole just didn't come together well. Individually they are all very good, but I feel that Duck and Waffle is trying too hard with these sweet and savory pairings and they're just not working out. What was most disappointing about the entire experience was the cold service we received. Based on other yelp reviews, it seems like it really depends on who your servers are, and maybe how well you dress. The biggest travesty of the meal was that they automatically added a \"DISCRETIONARY 12.5% service charge\". I quickly looked through other reviews, and it seems to be a common occurrence. How is it a DISCRETIONARY charge of they automatically add it in without telling you?!? Is it based on THEIR DISCRETION? I flagged down someone to remove the charge, and they did so without complaint, but we were met with even colder service afterwards (they threw the new bill on the table without saying a word). Considering tipping is not even customary in London, I'm not sure if they do it because foreigners might not be aware of this, and blindly pay without checking the bill. Overall, while the food was decent, and the view was nice, the shady service charge added on was highly disappointing. Yes, this is a great place for a date or a celebration meal, but I don't think anyone should come here regularly. The view is nice, but not worth the high prices (our meal came out to \u00a377 which is quite a lot for lunch IMO).",

    "text": "One of the worst experiences I've ever had. Ruined my trip to London, incredibly racist staff.I was visiting a buddy of mine for the weekend and he recommended that since we would be out very late we get a reservation at Duck & Waffle for a late night bite. He said his parents went there all the time and told him the food was great. We made a reservation for 2:30 AM, not a typo, but the place is open 24/7 so it isn't out of the ordinary. When we got to the restaurant we saw a long line waiting to get inside. After talking to the lady in front of us we realized that this was the line for non-reservation guests only. So we went to the front of the line to talk to the bouncer, who was letting people into and out of the restaurant. This is where our night goes completely downhill. The bouncer we encountered was incredibly rude and unprofessional. When we asked him if we could go inside as we had a reservation he refused and asked to see it. Fair enough. Unfortunately, it was buried in my friend's email inbox so we had to step aside and look for it. As we were looking we overhead the bouncer tell one of his coworkers that we were probably just making it up and just trying to cut the line. I confronted him and said, \"I heard what you just said. Trust me , we have a reservation...\" The bouncer doesn't reply, just stares at me. My friend finally finds the reservation, and when we go to show the bouncer he refuses to let us in! He claimed we were acting too intoxicated (this is while the people in line were clearly very intoxicated). We ask to see a manager. He reluctantly calls him down, and says to us that the manager is just going to tell you the same thing I told you. We argue with the manager who tells us if the bouncer says you are too intoxicated you can't come up and that is final. After arguing with him for what felt like 10 minutes, he ultimately lets us go through, but says we can't order any alcoholic drinks when we get upstairs. My friend and I, outraged at this point, but still hungry, agree. When we get upstairs we are greeted with nothing less than complete commotion. It seemed like everyone in the restaurant was belligerently drunk. Guests were knocking down glasses, yelling at each other, food was spilled all over the tables, etc. After being seated we call over the manager again to discuss how we were being treated by the establishment. Particularly, \u00a0how unprofessional it was to deny us entry or drinks because we were \"too intoxicated\" when we were clearly coherent enough to find a reservation, and calmly argue \u00a0our situation with him and the bouncer downstairs, not to mention the behavior of the other guests who were evidently more intoxicated than us. Obviously we were very upset, but instead of trying to accommodate us the manager tells the bouncers to \"Come over and escort these two gentlemen out.\" At this point, we are just stunned.As the security guards come over we told the Manager that we felt targeted and their establishment's treatment of us was nothing short of racist, (as both my friend and I are Indian, whereas most other guests were white and female). I guess that was the magic word, because he told the bouncers to \"stand down\" and finally tried to have an open dialogue with us. Ultimately, after a 15 minute discuss he realized his mistakes and told us the bouncer downstairs would be spoken too. He offered to comp us the meal and make us any drink we wanted stating that it was clear to him now that \"we weren't intoxicated at all.\" We denied both... Paid the full amount and told him that we won't be coming back and neither would my friend's parents.",

    "text": "Duck and WaffleI went to this restaurant at high noon as I knew it would be pretty amazing. \u00a0The day was clear of clouds and the restaurant is perched on the 40th floor of the Herons Tower in the financial district in the City of London. \u00a0Using the tube to get there and exiting at the Liverpool Street. \u00a0Really this place has it all in that it is well situated in City of London and its open 24/7. \u00a0Which makes it a great if you choose to visit some of the oldest pubs in City of London such as The Hoop and Grape and find yourself craving some midnight snacks. \u00a0The name is in the restaurant. \u00a0Duck and Waffle specializes in this dish but also has plenty of other options that can appeal to many palettes. \u00a0Fresh baked breads are a must if you love carbs. \u00a0It comes out nice piping out from the oven and a great opinion if you get the English Burrata. \u00a0Other starters that I recommend from the snacks and small plates that I felt are a must are the bacon wrapped dates and smoked eel. \u00a0If you love bacon then these dates are to die for...one is not enough for one person maybe three is a good number to start for one person. \u00a0Crispy bacon on the outside stuffed with Portuguese sausage lingui\u00e7a and one of my favorite cheese Manchego make such a perfect bite. \u00a0The smoked eel I say is a must as if you love smoked fishes. \u00a0The UK and other neighboring Scandinavian countries do smoked fish the best as this art of preserving foods has been going on for centuries. \u00a0Each bite of eel is brightened up with creme fracihe. You will need to get the Duck and Waffle dish if you have come this far to eat at Duck and Waffle. \u00a0At least have someone in your party should get it and may have it in there desire to share. \u00a0It has the perfectly crispy cooked duck leg and thigh served over warm crunchy waffle with a fried duck egg to cut open as you devour each bite. \u00a0If you like sweetness a maple syrup is served on the side for the drizzling adventure. \u00a0Duck and Waffle of course offers much more but these are my recommendations. \u00a0They have a full bar with creative cocktails. \u00a0My favorite which was the Red Pepper Spritz as it was refreshing on a hot day with a very good flavor of red bell pepper. \u00a0One other note about this restaurant you cannot wear any hats in the building and you take a separate elevator that is located in front of the Heron Tower to get to Duck and Waffle. \u00a0You cannot miss it from the street.",

Some things to know....  get the pork apple corn dog. Or maybe get 5. It was my favorite.

I had an excellent old fashioned while friends enjoyed other mixed drinks. The food was okay. Not fantastic for the price of the experience, but okay. Friends agreed that the best entree was the duck and waffles, as it ought to be. We also tried the octopus, beef tartare, roasted cauliflower, polenta bites, burrata ravioli and maple-glazed cornbread. The beef tartare was sliced thin, rather than minced, which didn't appeal to our group. I didn't care for the ravioli with burrata and marjoram with artichokes, watercress and hazelnuts. And the polenta bites were pretty bland. I did like the cornbread with an ample amount of diced jalape\u00f1o, the sweet glaze and harissa yogurt. It was a good combination of spicy-sweet-savory. But I probably would not come back for cornbread. An old fashioned, maybe!",

    "text": "What a lovely experience!We went for Sunday Brunch and were very lucky with the weather. Could see all the way to Wembley Stadium! The ride up is quite something (look to the right of the main entrance). You step into a glass elevator on the outside of the building and shoot up to the 40th floor quick enough to make your ears pop. A word of advice, go left out of the lift - not right and into the janitor's cupboard as I did!You should walk into the bar area (where you can have a coffee/cocktail if you're not eating) and then into the restaurant proper. We were there on a Sunday morning so there were more families, couples etc than bankers and so the atmosphere was quite fun an relaxed. The waiting stuff were fun, attentive and quick. We ordered a plate of stuffed dates to share and then a duck & waffle and ox cheek eggs benedict both were superb (although part of me wanted to pig out and have the full english).One set of eggs were fried, the other poached and both were perfect. The salt v sweet, soft v crunchy contrat of the duck and waffle was definitely the best of the two dishes. Although the hollandaise a beef combo ran it close. As we're not alcoholics, there was no drinking and the result was a very reasonable \u00a340 for 2 people. Not the sort of thing you'd do every week but a great place to impress out of toweners/parents/girfriend or a little treat.",

The choices available are decent but you definitely need to choose correctly. \u00a0In our group there were 4 dishes. I had the roast sausage which was good but didnt blow me away. One of us went for the fois gras, extremely rich so the generous portion was a bit too much. I did manage to try the hash browns as an additional and would definitely recommend them, very tasty! overall the food was good, and reasonably priced... but if you brunching for food instead of the view there are better places.The service was attentive and friendly and I would definitely come back.",

When I arrived at Duck & Waffle, it was 3:15am and I was inarguably sober. I had not been drinking that evening. However when they asked for ID, I handed mine to my friend to pass along. They took this to mean I was wasted past an acceptable level. Ridiculous. And they refused to let us into the restaurant. We ended up waiting in the cold for over an hour and weren't let into the restaurant until 4:30. My friends and i have been set on coming to this place for a while and drove all the way into the city to eat here, so we didn't want to just turn around and go home.But moral of the story, is the guards downstairs have wayyyy too much power and use it against you because they can... Totally ruins the restaurant for the rest of the night. And when we spoke to the manager about it she really didn't seem to give a crap.",

Our wines arrived halfway through the meal despite multiple reminders so unfortunately couldn't even wash it down. The foie gras creme brulee with lobster on top was one to try but unfortunately another disappointment as it tasted too sweet and all wrong with the consistency of a melted parfait.

We had an early sat night booking 5:30pm so once it got busier they eventually left us well alone - not really a happy medium. The food is great, my highlights: the squid & chorizo plus nduja and cheese bread sharing plates were absolutely delicious. It is very pricy for what it is but the setting does make up for it.

It's pretty much the height of business-chic, haha.The decor is smart and groovy and the service is friendly and efficient but the views are TRULY outstanding, especially at and after dusk. In fact, in my opinion, the vista from the west-facing bars is best, taking in all the tall and old City buildings and St Pauls Cathedral. Arguably, the restaurant and bar should have been swapped around, and this must surely be the first time for Qype that such an architectural criticism is a reason for giving a restaurant 4 and not 5 out of 5 stars?! If there was a 4.5, maybe I'd have given that \u00a0due to the lovely view of the river and Tower Bridge from the south side of this restaurant! The food? It is an interesting 4 star maybe for a surprising though creative combo menu. Small plates make it seem even reasonable, such as the tasty English smoked haddock scotch egg with curried mayo for \u00a36 and crab on toast for \u00a310, but they soon mount up to a nice-sized bill, however, especially if washed down by \u00a312+ cocktails before, and \u00a325+ wine from during and a \u00a310 single brandy after. I wondered how the whole roast chicken for \u00a325 and desert menu would have worked into the mix, but the size of our wallets, and the fact that it was already after midnight on a school night put a full stop to that!",

The food is really good, especially the signature Duck & Waffle waffle and the Elvis Waffle. However, it is the location of the place which makes it so attractive. Plus, it is open 24 hours which makes it accessible for every occasion.",

What a great move, checked out the bar on the sushisamba level which is on two floors, then went up one more floor to enjoy drinks at duck and waffles bar. * duck and waffle bar is quieter. \u00a0you don't have to book to go to these bars, so they get really busy, people in and out, scrambling for every space or seat to be near the window. It is an amazing view though. The drinks was on another level. Great drinks menu.  Duck waffle the venue was superb, high up in the sky with the view over London. Can't beat that. Couple tables are situated around the windows, and larger tables in the middle. Service was exceptional, really prompt and friendly. The food is made for sharing mostly. And its unique and very different. Weird mixture of flavours, to be honest some worked well and some didn't. But it was truly a good experience, never felt rushed and had a good time.",

D&W really reminded me of the City Club on Bunker Hill in Los Angeles... but the crowd and atmosphere here was much more casual.This was one of my favorite meals in London. Duck & Waffles is located on the very top floor of this noticeably tall black building (which i'm sure has a name ). The venue was gorgeous and view was already worth whatever price that D&W would charge. My partner and I splurged on this dinner and ordered as much as our hearts desired. Of course we got their signature D&W... which puts Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles to shame. The big piece of duck meat simply fell off the bone and it was the perfect kind of combination. We didn't expect to use the entire syrup bottle... but we did, and it was worth the calories. We also ordered a side of grilled octopus, ox-cheek donuts, foie gras creme brulee. We had the right amount and it surprisingly made us full. The Foie Gras creme burlee was an interesting dish. Who would have known that creme burlee can also be savory? The Ox-Cheek donut is a huge fried ball. It was kind of boring compared to the other dishes, but the mysterious sweet sauce made it good. The octopus was definitely my favorite dish. It wasn't very special, but something about it made it addicting. Their drinks are also pretty good. I had some special Nutella drink that the waitress recommended. The drink came in a fake Nutella jar and tastes nothing like Nutella, but \u00a0I guess it had a SLIGHT hazelnut flavor and it was very alcoholic... which I enjoyed. The waitress was really nice, and the staff was extremely professional. The bill was pretty high, but I would come here again if I ever come back to London!",

We had the cornbread, pig ears, ox cheek doughnut, foie gras cr\u00eame brulee, tuna, and of course the duck and waffle. Everything was very flavorful and unlike anything we'd ever had before! The duck and waffle was my favorite, the duck was well prepared and perfectly seasoned over a crisp, soft waffle. Topped with an egg and comes with syrup for you to add to your liking. A must try! Would definitely go back here to try other dishes. Make reservations well in advance!",

    "text": "I came home late on Friday night and couldn't fall asleep and opened the Yelp App. As it was 3am, it recommended that I go eat at Duck & Waffle if I'm hungry. Seeing that it was opened so late and has a 4 star review, I curiously opened up the business page to see what this place was about, and found through the Yelp reviews that:1. It has a gorgeous view of london on the 40th floor2. It has a really interesting menu (pig ears, oxtail donut, duck confit with waffles)3. It opens 24-7 4. Reservation is recommended but I can do it directly via open table on YelpI decided then that I would make a reservation and clicked on Open Table only to find that regardless of which dates i provide, I can't get a reservation!!!! At this point, it's 4am and I have become a bit delirious. I need to find out how a restaurant can be completely booked for the rest of life if it's opened 24-7. Is it that good???I got up from my bed and turned on my computer instead. I opened the Open Table website in an attempt to figure out what the next available date is, and it's THREE MONTHS from now. Three dinner slots are available, none the days before and none the days after. How is this even possible, they're open 24 hours, seven days a week!I then began to research their walk-in policies, but i couldn't find it anywhere. At 5am, I decided I would call them. After two consecutive calls, no one answered. I started to give in, and decided I really should go to bed and stop the derelict obsession. I sent an email to their reservations asking about their policies on walk in and then went to bed.I woke up the next morning and saw their reply asking me to call them. It turned out that open table only takes dinner reservations between specific hours, which is why it's so difficult to book. ***If you call them or email them directly, they can slot you in as long as they have availabilities. They don't recommend that you walk in for eating (you can for their bar) but will take your reservation for any time. They want you to make a reservation even for 1am, though you likely won't *need* one. They won't let you walk up if they are really fully booked so it's better if you just call ahead.I ended up making a breakfast reservation for the next morning at 8am. We arrived early, at 7:30am and the restaurant was near empty. We were seated by the window at the East corner so we can watch the sunrise. The restaurant didn't fill up until almost 10am for their brunch menu.Unfortunately, their breakfast menu was very small - with maybe 4 or 5 main items. I got the duck and waffle (\u00a315) and my bf got the banana brulee (\u00a39). Coffee is \u00a34 and comes with warm milk (nice touch), and freshly squeezed orange juice is \u00a35.5. Expensive drinks.I liked the waffle, but was not that impressed with the duck confit (I live in paris after all) as it was a little too dry. The banana brulee was amazing, as it had hard caramel on top of the split in half banana. Chocolate syrup, vanilla ice cream, and waffles. YUM! \u00a0After a duck and waffle, banana brulee and waffle, a side breakfast sausage that look like intestines, three coffees and two orange juice, the damage was about \u00a365. Overall I wasn't too impressed with the food but maybe dinner might be better. Service was fantastic and the but the ambiance is unparalleled. The view was the best part. So worth it. Next time I'm in the city, I'm totally booking for sunset!",

For starters, we ordered gruyere and nduja on bread and beef tartare. Both starters came in a generous portion and tasted delicious. For mains, we ordered none other than the famous duck and waffle. I would say the duck was very well cooked. The meat was tender and juicy, it was not too salty yet was well marinated. I'm knocking off a star as the waffle was way too normal.

Nothing wrong with the dish, the duck is confit to perfection, and the waffle with mustard maple syrup compliments it nicely, but there are so many other hidden gems about the place. It must have been my lucky day that I managed to get a booking for the next day, and at the 11.45am slot. But luckier still to be able to try out a starter plate that captured my imagination, and remains on my mind to this day, almost a full fortnight later. I'm talking about none other than the foie gras Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e with slowly warmed brioche and pork crackling drizzled on TOP. I mean, what's more to describe, the name of the dish is enough to get your saliva glands going into overdrive. Seriously, what more can I say? It is as good as it sounds. So, by all means, go to Duck and Waffle. But don't forget the little starter plate that once you have, will obsess your mind for a Long time.",

But alas, one can only dream.My friends and I had a late dinner reservation on Wednesday evening, mainly because we had just flown in from San Francisco and booked something the day of. We take the elevators up the 40th floor, which was super thrilling in itself. There is a free coat check, a panoramic view of the city, cheeky bartenders, and expensive decor that is just dripping #CHIC. Couple things that stood out-+service: from the host, to the bartender, to the server- everyone was in good spirits, accommodating, and made our experience pleasant. Our party didn't arrive all together at once because a few were working late hours, but no worries we were seated right away and chatted over apps and drinks while waiting for the rest of the crew to arrive. Despite being one of the most upscale restaurants in London, not a drop of pretentiousness or snootiness was felt here. +bbq spiced pig ears: doesn't sound too appetizing, but was unique and had a nice crunch. Sort of addicting to be honest, couldn't stop snacking on it after it arrived in a brown bag. +duck & waffle: duh. who would come without trying the signature dish. Leg confit was crispy yet tender, and the duck egg on top really brought it over the edge. The sweetness of the maple syrup and saltiness of the duck & egg complemented each other fantastically on a neutral backdrop of the fluffy waffle. +whole sea bass: don't ask questions, just order it. Sea bass was rich & buttery, and the presentation was regal.",

    "text": "This is easily one of the coolest restaurants I have ever been to. First off, the elevator just to get to the restaurant is unreal. It blasts you up 40 floors at hyper-speed with rainbow lights and an all glass enclosure for great views. Next, right when you walk in is a bar in the middle of a room with bartenders making drinks right in front of you. There are neat lights hanging everywhere, graffiti walls, dim lighting - very cool vibes. Keep in mind, this is all before you even get to the hostess table. The dining room was just as cool. There is an open kitchen so you can watch everything being made. The windows were a little fogged at the time, but I know there was a great view on the other side. The wine list was pretty extensive and there were a number of great cocktails to choose from. To start, we had to go with the duck & waffle, which the restaurant is obviously named after. What a dish! It's got an egg on top and is plated in such a cool way. Highly recommend as your starter to share with the table. Then we got two of the bigger shareable dishes (for 4 total), one fish and one beef. They were both incredible. The meat was cooked perfectly to my liking. The fish wasn't dry at all. Both came over some nice sauce with vegetables. Our server Michael from Poland was hilarious. He was very helpful making recommendations and even cut our duck for us ha. We never knew whether or not to tip in London (coming from America) but we absolutely had to for Michael. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time so you can experience this wonderful place! They are somehow open 24/7, so you'll be able to find something available if you're willing to eat later in the evening. Although it's a little out of the way towards Shoreditch, this is a must in London, especially if you're a foodie!",

    "text": "Possibly the top meal of the trip to London. Came by here a bit later in the night 1am (they're open 24/7), and there was still a tad bit of a wait, but after waiting about 15 minutes we were let in, and shot up to the 40th floor. I typically never say anything about views, but this has gotta be one of the best places to see London from the sky.Getting back on track we ordered a few things:The Duck and Waffle: The Staple here. The waffle was super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The Duck was juicy and delicious. Just keep in mind here that if you're here with 3 people you'll probably want to order 2 of these. Get This. The BBQ Pig Ears: The surprise of the night. The waiter came by and dropped off a bag with a wax stamp that sealed it, and inside were hot crispy bbq seasoning dusted pig ears. These things were Fire! Get this. Smoked Salmon w Avo Toast and Scrambled Eggs: Everything on this was ok. Nothing special here though. Skip This. In the end we were pretty shocked that the bill was less than 60GBP. That view up there is everything though, and the duck and those pig ears were memorable. Definitely check this place out if you're in London. FYI: Fri and Sat (not late night) they dont allow athleisure wear, so dress the part if you plan to go then. Also, they prepared the duck and waffle differently than the more casual location in picadilly, so if you havent been to this one specifically I'd say try this one out as it was better in my book.",

    "text": "As one of the hottest and hyped up places in London, our food adventure in the city wouldn't have been complete without a visit to the famous Duck & Waffle!We made a reservation over a month in advance and the earliest table available was 9:30pm on a Wednesday night! With reservations so difficult to procure, eating here feels almost exclusive, and they don't quite let you forget it - you still need to confirm your reservation 24-72 hours beforehand, there's a \u00a320 charge per person if you no-show or cancel less than 24 hours in advance, and there's a smart casual dress code so dress to impress!Dining here is definitely an experience from start to finish, and with no lack of spectacular views. Beginning with the glass elevator ride up to the 40th floor speeding up over the city below, you then enter the hip and trendy bar area where you can enjoy some creative cocktails as you wait to be seated. There's even a lit-up set of stairs leading down to Sushi Samba on the floor below which provides yet another photo opportunity and place to gawk over the views. We were fortunate to be seated at a fantastic corner table tucked next to the window, allowing the sprawling city lights to be the backdrop for our dinner!One of the impressive things about Duck & Waffle is that they are open 24/7; they have different menus for various times of day, but one thing that is consistent for all of them is their specialty and namesake - the duck and waffle - which, of course, we had to order. I was intrigued by and knew I wanted to get the spiced duck doughnut and foie gras creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e to try as well.The duck and waffle, consisting of duck confit over a waffle topped with a fried duck egg and syrup, was pretty good, but perhaps a bit overrated, and a tad smaller than expected. What really stole the show for me was the SPICED DUCK DOUGHNUT! Words cannot describe the deliciousness of this huge ball of flavor...served on a bed of pineapple jam, covered in paprika sugar, and with tasty duck inside the layers of soft dough, I probably could've ordered another one (or two) to just enjoy by myself. Finally, the foie gras creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was interesting, yet another well done mix of sweet and savory and paired well with the pork crackling and marmalade brioche it came with. Service was not as pretentious as expected, which was a pleasant surprise! Our drink and food orders were taken and delivered fairly quickly, and our server was friendly and efficient. There was a lot of shuffling of us around from the stairs to the bar to our seats but the employees we did interact with were generally helpful.This was not a cheap dinner by any means, with the cocktails at \u00a314 each, duck and waffle at \u00a318, doughnut at \u00a312, etc. The dining room was also packed extremely full and was bustling and loud, so probably not a great place if you're trying to relax with some quiet conversation. However, if you're looking for some good food (at any hour of day!), a vibrant, very alive late night atmosphere, and/or just a cool overall experience, it's worth a visit at least once while in London!",

If you make your way there, make sure to check out the view from the grand spiral staircase while sipping on a Pink Peppercorn Lemonade or a Ristretto Negroni. The peppercorn flavor was wonderfully balanced in that cocktail, and the Negroni touts a 24 hr slow dropped coffee. Both are delicious...and don't forget to get a munchie -- I recommend the crispy bbq pig ears. Prices are a bit steep, and it is quite hard to get in a reservation for a table, so plan ahead. Wonderful service from Alexander. Hope to come back and try the main courses and bump up to a 5 Star.",

    "text": "This has to be one of the most difficult reservations to make in the World. Online reservations open up 2 months in advance and popular times are snatched up very quickly. \u00a0They also require a credit card guarantee - no shows or cancellations in less than 24 hours will result in a fee of GBP20 per person. The last few times we were in London, I didn't book far ahead enough and never got a chance to go there. \u00a0This time, I made our reservation about 6 weeks in advance and the \"best available\" time for a Friday night was 9:30PM. \u00a0I grabbed that right away and happily entered my credit card information to guarantee the spot.Upon arrival we skipped the long line outside the building (which was for people going to the bar or had no reservations and hoping to get in if there were enough no shows) and went straight to the receptionist. \u00a0He verified our reservation and let us in the door to go through security. \u00a0After that we rode the private glass elevator to the 40th floor (if you are afraid of heights just don't look outside).When we reached the dining room, the hostess verified our reservation and led us to a window table which I had requested. \u00a0Once we sat down, we saw the World famous Gherkin building almost right in front of our eyes. \u00a0Looking further down, we saw the River Thames and the beautifully lit-up Tower Bridge.So what would you order at Duck and Waffle? \u00a0Duck and waffle, I guess?Absolutely! \u00a0And that must be the best duck confit that I've ever had. \u00a0The skin was perfectly paper-thin, golden brown and crispy, and had completely separated from the meat. \u00a0The duck was so tender, moist, and flavorful that it tasted almost heavenly. \u00a0The amateur gourmet chef in me would guess that it had been marinated overnight and then slowed cooked in its own natural juices and fat for hours.The portion size of the waffle was rather small but delicious and went well with the duck. \u00a0If you've ever had chicken and waffle and like the combination, you'll fall in love with this dish. \u00a0The final touch of the dish was the sunny side up duck egg. \u00a0So how's a duck egg different from a regular (chicken) egg? \u00a0I would say not much difference in the egg white, but the duck egg's yoke is a lot thicker and richer.We also shared an order of spinach and ricotta ravioli, which was served with a watercress puree in pea broth, and garnished with roasted almonds. \u00a0The dish was delicious but outshined by the duck and waffle.We decided to bypass dessert but took the opportunity to sample a plate of European cheeses to finish our wine. \u00a0That turned out to be an excellent decision as those European cheeses were so amazing and provided the perfect finishing touches to a delightful and memorable dinner.",

    "text": "Arrived for brunch on a Sunday afternoon travelling solo for work. First the doorman at the foot of 110 Bishopsgate advised there weren't any tables and rightly advised there wasn't any food served in the bar. I was surprised to be able to make a reservation on their website for a 1-person table for 12.45, the exact time I was standing at their front door. The doorman was surprised to see me return and phoned up to the hostess who confirmed I had a booking - I'd had to entry my credit card number so they could charge me \u00a320 in the case of a no show, so I was hoping they'd honour the reservation. The doorman seemed less interested in welcoming me and more in telling the hostess that he was turning people away and that he needed to be better informed, in spite of his tablet getting live bookings like mine. Upstairs the hostess welcomed me and took me through to the restaurant floor, only to realise that the table hadn't yet been reset. A short stint in the bar, where I was offered a menu but didn't get the chance to order anything, and I was back at table looking out at a strikingly grey Square Mile.The waiter struggled with me wanting a \"black coffee\", the choice of filter or a black americano muddied with offers of lattes and cappuccinos. My americano eventually arrives with a side of hot milk which I advise the waitress I won't be using. My sparkling water is topped up a passing floor manager in a tie, finally allowing me to order my House Breakfast. Its a \u00a316 fry up and doesn't disappoint with a good amount of bacon, two beautifully poached eggs with bright orangey, yellow yikes. The chefs are on top of things, shame about everybody else. No one checks on me during my meal, my coffee runs out half way through my breakfast but we've given up topping up my water glass now so I don't get the chance to order a second from my waiter or anyone else. Having completed my breakfast I sit for too long waiting to have my plate clear. I ask my waiter for the bill, having been offered more drinks, but instead watch him busily take orders and interact with other customers. Apparently my cheque has gotten lost. Another floor manager approaches my table asking if everything is alright. I tell him I'm waiting for my bill and that the service has been lacking. He thanked me for my feedback and comped my coffee as well as removing the service fee. I wasn't the right customer for them. I wasn't spending big bucks on \u00a314 brunch cocktails and chilling with friends for the two and a half hours the booking engine had alloted for my visit, but apparently their army of staff and 13.5% service fee are not enough to see the service match the price tag.",

They where a bit anal about their time schedule. \"Be on time, don't be late, make sure you are here in good time, you have 45 mins at your table and that's it\" sending emails and calling before we arrived, but once we were there they did not rush us, but I still had that inner clock ticking which made at least my experience a little less good. Without that I would have given them four stars.We were celebrating my daughters birthday and they congratulated her which I appreciate, we also had really nice champagne drinks and prompt service. The people watching and the view of London is 100% thumbs up here.",

It's a bit hard to find at night (look for the express elevator next to Sushi Samba and a few taxis out front). I LOVED that they were open 24 hours (even the kitchen!) so when I was jet lagged I came up to enjoy the beautiful nighttime skyline and their famous foie gras creme brulee with toasted brioche.The creme brulee was really dense and rich. Served with brioche and jam that was a little too sweet. I enjoyed something nearly identical and much better at Sage in Las Vegas. 3 stars for food, 4.5 stars for views and ambiance!",

    "text": "I love Duck and Waffle - both for the view and the good. Order: Caramelized Banana Waffle; Duck and Waffle Waffle; latte; cappuccinoAvoid: arriving late as they only hold your table 15 mins and are normally very busy Situated in the business area of London, this restaurant is in an impressive skyscraper on the 40th story (if you are afraid of heights, this may not be the best place for you - try Duck and Waffle Local instead). To get to the restaurant, you check in at the bottom with a receptionist who will let you into the elevators. Take in the view as you quickly travel 40 stories. Once you reach the 40th floor, you walk past the bathrooms and through the bar to reach the main dining area. Try to get a seat on the window, no matter what direction you face, you will have beautiful views. You can even see the gherkin, Tower of London, and tower bridge! Also keep in mind, you only have 1 hour and 15 mins at your table on busy days, so READ THE MENU BEFOREHAND so you don't waste time looking at your menu instead of outside. I love the caramelized banana waffle. It is \u00a01/2 a waffle served with 1 whole, br\u00fbl\u00e9ed banana on top of a tasty Nutella-like spread. This is all topped with a yummy vanilla ice cream. You can also ask for a plain waffle with maple syrup, but remember it's only \u00a01/2 a waffle so you might get hungry later. If you enjoy savory waffles, I highly recommend their Duck and Waffle - it is truly delicious and incredibly flavorful. Strangely you cannot order their pastry basket, which comes with 1 croissant, 1 pain au chocolat, and 1 raisin pastry, with only the pastries you want. You must get these three pastries, which I found odd and unnecessary. As far as drinks go, they have good espresso drinks. Also, the Bloody Mary is quite spicy but has a very nice flavor - make sure to ask for salt on the rim. I would come here again - if not for the view then for food. It is always a bright, yummy place to bring people, especially those new to London. Make reservations well ahead of time - during the busier summer months and Christmas time, they get very packed very quickly. Do not arrive late and look at the menu beforehand to really enjoy the experience.",

We were then waived over to go up the elevators to the duck and waffle 40th floor. The ride up was great because the view was beautiful. I would rather eat at a place a view then paying for an attraction just to see the same view.we walked over to the bar area after exiting the elevator to go to the next hostess. She told us that we were a little early and to have a seat. We ordered a couple of drinks and we had an opportunity to take some pictures with the view. I really enjoyed the look of the bar area and the bartender seemed really experienced but there was only one person for a room that had a least 12 people. we were escorted to our table by our hostess and unfortunately didn't get the coveted window view. The entire restaurant had a pretty good view regardless of where you sat. Another unfortunate event was being seated very closely to the kitchen. The kitchen was hot and the restaurant was hot. This combined made our sitting location really uncomfortable. we were greeted by our waiter and he brought over water with ice in a separate bowl for us to put into our water. My boyfriend ordered the duck and waffle and I ordered the duck souffl\u00e9. \u00a0I wasn't really hungry due to the heat. We constantly could hear the head chef shouting orders to the kitchen staff. It seemed like she ran a really tight ship but the staff seemed to not skip a beat. The souffl\u00e9 wasn't great. The crown of the souffl\u00e9 was really tough and hard to break into. I had to work to get every bite. My boyfriends waffle was alright as well. It was nothing too amazing but he enjoyed the duck. The rave reviews and the fancy atmosphere of dress code and deposit money for your reservations made me believe this would be an amazing experience. I wasn't really impressed but the view was good.",

    "text": "Whoever is doing the PR for Duck & Waffle deserves a raise-- this spot is listed in damn near every \"Where to Eat in London\" article on the internet, and really shouldn't belong there. After making our reservation over a month in advance, we finally roll up to the entrance at 8AM for our breakfast. After being shot up 40 floors in the elevator, we sit down at our table. It's a fairly easy menu, not having a ton of options, especially given the duck & waffle is the must-have. My partner and I ordered one Duck & Waffle and one Ox Cheek Benedict. We each enjoyed our respective meals, and disliked the others' ironically enough. The food itself was good, and the views really are spectacular, but I honestly don't believe that it merits such a high price point. The food was certainly good, but tiny little portions for the price. For 16 pounds, you can serve a whole waffle. The thing dragging down this rating though, was the haughty attitude of nearly every employee we interacted with. The hostess, server, security, and manager all spoke to us condescendingly and smugly, as if it were a gift they were allowing us to be in their restaurant. We made sure to dress up, as we noted the dress code and are very polite, kind people. We had no idea why we were talked down to. It rubbed us entirely the wrong way, and I do not plan on returning.",

    "text": "I'd give this review 4 stars for the food but the service is bumping it down one star. We had a reservation for 11:45pm on a Tuesday night, but there were plenty of open tables on arrival so I suspect a reservation wouldn't have been necessary. We ordered crispy pig ears, the duck & waffle, and duck egg en cocotte. And also ordered the Green Gimlet and Pi\u00f1a Kale-ada.1) The pig ears were a HIT. The texture put a fun twist on a typical french fry and the BBQ seasoning was very flavorful. I wish we hadn't eaten them so quickly.2) The duck & waffle came with a sunny side up egg. The waffle and egg were nothing spectacular but the duck was great. Not dry, crispy outside and tender inside and went well with the maple syrup. \u00a318 its a bit steep for the dish but I guess the cost is taking into account the ambience and view of London 3) Duck egg en cocotte was NOT what I was expecting in the most pleasant way possible. A fried duck egg sat in a small cast iron skillet drowned in gruyere and truffles. Small breadsticks were on the side for dipping. This was my favorite dish.4) The Green Gimlet was alright, pretty clean and nice if you like gin. Fair warning, if you want a green drink, this is not green. It's clear as water.5) Now if you want a green drink, the pi\u00f1a kale-ada is pretty fucking green. Topped with toasted kale and a dried pineapple slice, the drink itself was sweet and not bitter. I got the non-alcoholic version for \u00a37 but it does come with rum for \u00a314 The food was good but overpriced, understandably so.But the service was all over the place. We had 6 different waitors serving our table and we had to ask different servors multiple times for refills/napkins etc because none of them seemed to be assigned our table. The man who took our order was extremely rude and arrogant, who didn't seem to understand what customer service is. When he came to our table, he slouched against the wall and bluntly asked \"What do you want?\" Later, when we asked to see the full cocktail menu, he basically told us \"There's no point, it's not going to tell you anything but fine I'll get it.\" He definitely made a bad impression on the restaurant but the other 5 waitors were nothing like him.Overall impression: expensive over-hyped duck recipes with a nice view of the city and club-like ambience. This place is more for the aesthetic than for the food experience.",

    "text": "Wow, well worth the price.Yes! Dress code is important! They seem like they'll try not to be rude about your clothing by pointing it out, but definitely in the evening people are wearing nicer dresses, nicer shoes (some heels), and button up. I don't recommend wearing sneakers, Converse, flip flops, shorts, lighter denim shades or T-shirts. The 40 flight ascent was so beautiful to capture. Though we had reservations, we had to wait about 15 minutes in the bar area before we could sit. The restaurant area is small, but it was good for being able to see the view no matter where you sat. We didn't get a window seat, but we still could gaze out at the view around us. Service was alright. I'd say everyone was nice, but it was confusing at times. We had a total of 4 people help us and weren't even sure who to ask for certain things. The man who welcomed us gave a nice guide to the menu. Then another took our order and ended up forgetting the drinks, then bringing back one wrong order. Then we didn't see him the rest of the night so maybe he ended his shift?All that aside, I thought the food was stellar.I had a bacon wrapped date (3.5 pounds) which was tiny, but really packed with flavor. Theres a mix of cheese and meat filling the date, and it's all wrapped with salty bacon. The date flavor isn't very strong since it's so heavy on meat, and the mustard sauce made it overall a savory snack. It was definitely a fun bite.The maple jalapeno cornbread came out steaming hot! It was delicious, but just tasted like your standard cornbread with a bit more heat.The DUCK DOUGHNUT (12 pounds), is a big WOW. Highly recommend! It's not like a pate filling, but a sort of ground up meat inside. But I was mostly fascinated by the bread itself: it's not like normal-donut fluffy, but it's a more dense version that still can qualify as fluffy. The spiced outside made this crunchy outer to this soft bite, and I couldn't get enough.The duck and waffle looked so small on Yelp, but the duck confit was actually near the size of a 1/4 chicken leg! The waffle was half the size it should be, and the egg was standard. Holy, the meat was really good. I think duck is one of my new favorite meats to have. It's like chicken, but fattier, and therefore more flavorful. You have to have a full bite that fits part of the egg, duck, waffle, and syrup into your mouth! It's a blessing.It was a splurge, but the experience was wonderful.",

After lucking out with a dinner reservation at 8 o'clock I was able to cancel my 0645 breakfast plans there. \u00a0This was a really fun experience, there's lots of staff to take care of you, and the place is loaded with personality. \u00a0If I go back again before leaving town I'll request a booth because once I'd been there a while the wooden seat felt a bit hard after 10+ hours of flying.Anyway, the bar fixed one of their signature drinks made with whiskey and black cherry. We ordered a mass of stuff to try and were so full by the end that we couldn't eat much of the \"entree\" items. Anyway, feeling adventurous, I tried the pig ears--think BBQ potato chips (US) or crisps (UK)--which was a first in this lifetime and they were brilliant. Also brilliant was the lamb-stuffed lavash or Pita bread which was perfectly seasoned and awonderful flavor bomb. I also quite liked the ox cheek, duck and waffle and bacon-wrapped dates in a mustard sauce. Not such a huge fan of the foie gras Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e or the Rabbit w/ Miso glaze.Overall, a great experience and I highly recommend a visit here because it just exudes so much personality and energy!!!",

    "text": "Nava kept asking me if I wanted to go, and I managed to find a brunch booking at a very late 3:00 pm on a Sunday. So Nava, the other half, and I went to Duck and Waffle to give it a whirl.First off, it's quite difficult to find. There's a door that's not easy to find, and then you go in and take a lift to the 40th floor, where you go behind an unlabelled door, down a twisty corridor, and you finally find yourself at the restaurant. So the views are spectacular. It was not the sunniest of days, but the views were still fantastic. We opted to get a bunch of stuff to share. We had the Foie Gras all day breakfast, the crispy pig ears, the ox cheek doughnut, the bacon wrapped dates, and two orders of the duck and waffle (I mean, you ARE there, you should enjoy it right?) We also had a round of bloody marys and a bottle of champagne while we were eating.The food is fantastic. The best was the dates. Nicely sweet and salty and delicious. You can never go wrong with foie gras seared on brioche, a quail egg, some black pudding, and a sweet nutty syrup. The ox cheek doughnut was also great and original. I've never had a doughnut stuff with meat, but I'll definitely have something like it again. The pig ears were sliced thin and deep fried. Very very well done. The duck and waffle was also pretty fantastic. The mustard maple syrup on top of the waffles, duck egg and duck confit gave it something special.Most of the dishes do the combination of sweet and savoury well. Which for brunch is perfect. We opted for dessert. We had the brownie with peanut butter ice cream and the Christmas pudding. The pudding was good, but nothing great, but the brownie dessert was pretty spectacular (especially if you like peanut butter). We also had a bottle of Maury to go with it, so it made it even more special.By the time we left, it had gotten dark (thanks to going so late in the day during the winter), so we also got to see the view with the city of London lit up below us. I'm definitely looking forward to going back and trying even more of the crazy dishes on the menu!",

    "text": "Top banana this place.An unrivalled view over the greatest city in the world and some proper Sunday brunch tucker to go with it. Big comfy booth to enjoy it all from and relaxed, unhurried but totally efficient service with a smile.I could have eaten everything on the menu. In fact I tried. Oysters to start. Plump and fresh as a daisy. Followed by some crispy pigs ears to start. Yes that's a second starter. 'All for me when your partner's pork free'. Served in a cute little paper bag so you eat them like crisps. Oh and some bread and olives. But that doesn't count. Followed by a baked egg and truffle beauty that was richer than anything down below in the square mile.Stanley couldn't finish his waffles with ice cream and we couldn't finish it for him. That's a first, literally. We were thinking of the poor lift that needed to take us back down from what is officially the highest restaurant in Britain. Debs had the signature Duck and Waffle. Beautifully crisp confit with a perfect fried egg on a tasty waffle drizzled with sweet sauce with a hint of five spice. It's not rocket science, but who wants to eat rockets for Sunday Brunch? Perfect.A busy open kitchen is there to gaze into if you've had enough of the stunning views. And lots of excited tourists and homies taking pictures that will never ever do the vista justice. I defy anyone to be too cool and nonchalant not to get a shot themselves. It's OK, you're allowed to be blown away. That's the point.The whole afternoon was enormous fun. Indulgent, relaxing. I just wrote a review of the Tom's kitchen Sunday brunch experience and they couldn't be more different. We reluctantly heaved ourselves off after a quick tour around all four sides and a special look westwards to Shepherd's Bush to spot the floodlights at the home of football. The lift went back down super fast due to the extra weight, and when we got to the bottom we went up and down again. All the fun of the fair without the puke.A short walk to the madness of Spitalfields and Brick Lane to roughen the edges a little of a snazzy Sunday afternoon. A great place whether you're just visiting or a Londoner born and bred. You can only book two months ahead for the Sunday gig and it goes early so have your wits about you if you're on a schedule. Bring a camera and don't eat anything on Saturday.",

Even if they are opened 24/7, it's a pretty fancy place so walking in and dining lavishly right away with your friends will make the experience a lot more splendid. If you didn't make reservations and you find yourself needing to wait, the bar prior to entering the restaurant is open without wait time. The bar area is also the fanciest place for photos in my opinion! Good view and decorations hanging all around.So what to order? Obviously the Duck & Waffle, right? The waiter told my party that the dishes are sharing size and that we should only order 4 Duck & Waffles for my group of 8. Go home, waiter! You're drunk!! If you're coming to Duck & Waffle, you better order one for yourself and eat it all! The dishes aren't that big so definitely not \"family style\" as the waiter was trying to suggest. Also, if you're ordering small plates, skip the spicy ox cheek doughnut. As intriguing as it may look, it was neither spicy or tasty. Pretty tasteless piece of dough, no flavour unless you dipped it in the tiny apricot jam that comes with it. The caramelized onion bread with anchovy / caper or the roasted octopus, is a much better small plate choice!",

Even if the food was awful (which it wasn't), the service and ambiance alone would get me to come back. The restaurant is on the 40th floor of the Heron building and has sweeping views of the city all around - pretty much every table has great views all around. The d\u00e9cor is trendy yet laid back.The service was superb. I found our server to be extremely helpful as well as enthusiastic about the menu - she gave great recommendations. I had to opt for the duck & waffle plate, which was both the best duck and the best waffle I've had. It's topped with a duck egg and served with mustard maple syrup. The flavors came together in the most amazing way - I was legitimately depressed when I took my last bite. Our table was also lucky enough to snag the last available dossant order, and it was unlike any dessert I've had - the texture was truly amazing. I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong ordering here. Every plate of food that came out looked incredible.All in all, please go here. I am doing my best to become a regular.",

If you don't like the idea of pouring maple syrup on top of everything, don't worry, as you get the syrup on the side. The foie gras creme brulee with lobster sounded rather intriguing, so we ordered that, as well as a wild mushroom and goat's cheese bread. The foie gras was a bit too sweet, but the texture was great. Lobster was also good. The bread was very tasty and was quite big (like a small pizza).

The seating area is great, nice table arrangement with sufficient space between tables. I had a range of starters including olives, bread and pigs ears, everything was fantastic. For my main I had the signature dish, the Duck and Waffle, oh boy I cannot describe how nice it was, it is a waffle with a crispy duck leg, fried egg on top with a side of maple syrup with mustard seeds. Granted it doesn't doing like you should put this together, but trust me, it is brilliant. If there were a 6th star I would click it. I will be going back in the near future.",

We also had a glass of dessert wine that was much cheaper but still very good. The food was great, very interesting combinations which I must admit sometimes lost me.

Before going I was familiar with chicken & waffle, a guilty pleasure back in California enjoyed in casual (and rather greasy) dining contexts. With this experience in mind, I was taken aback by the trendy vibe and impressive atmosphere of the restaurant.The duck & waffle plate exceeded my expectations and honestly put Cali's chicken & waffle to shame (but I will always remember it as my introduction to this unusual type of pairing). What really sold me on the restaurant was its location, 40 floors up in central London. The view of the city is unlike any other I've seen and is truly magical at night. The decor adds to this ambiance with an edgy flavor that simultaneously manages to maintain classy simplicity.Unfortunately the bar tender was out the night I went, but I will definitely be making a trip back to try their cocktails as their descriptions were all too tempting. What could be better than a delicious cocktail overlooking the city of London? Oh ya, some duck & waffle to follow it up!",

We didn't want to order room service the second night we were there, so we did an online search to see if there were any restaurants open 24 hours. I was expecting a place called Duck & Waffle to be a small diner of some sorts, boy was I wrong!The decor is modern, upscale, whimsical and unique. It was half empty, as expected at 4am. A handful of people were there clearly to wind down from partying the night before. A few people like us probably couldn't sleep and were there for breakfast as well. Point being, we didn't know what a popular spot this was and glad we were able to beat the crowd.The restaurant is 40 floors in the sky with gigantic windows, wow what an unexpected treat that was! We got to see the sun rise overlooking the beautiful city of London. Couldn't ask for a better view to accompany our breakfast! The food was amazing as well. We started off with a cappuccino and latte, both very good. I got the Berries 'n' Cream Belgian Waffle...honestly the best breakfast I have had in a long time. So simple, but executed perfectly. I seriously considered ordering another order of belgian waffles just to try the nutella/banana combination. That will have to wait until our next trip to London though, I was already full. My husband got the famous Duck 'n' Waffle and an extra side of eggs with sourdough toast. He is typically hard to please but was very happy with this food. Definitely recommend this place as a must visit if ever in the city of London!",

The sweetness of the apricot jam went quite well with the savouriness of the other components.We ordered a few other things, aside from the headline dishes. \u00a0We got some pig ear crackling (which came in a bag with some cajun coating). \u00a0This was moreish and I was regularly licking the tasty coating off from my fingers. \u00a0I had the duck egg cocotte, with gruyere cheese, mushrooms and truffle oil. This was also tasty, but unfortunately there wasn't much runny yolk to dip my soldiers in. \u00a0Maybe that's the price of it all coming in a hot pan to the table, and the egg tends to keep cooking.The big draw card is the view that you get from the restaurant being on the 40th floor of the Heron tower. \u00a0As such, it sometimes felt like a tourist attraction and restaurant combined. \u00a0It's weird when you have people walking up to the window near your table and taking photos.The service was amiable and we felt welcome.It looks like you need to have a booking whenever you come here. A guy at the bottom of the tower checks your name against a list before you go in the lift. I'm guessing this applies all of the time, even at 4am. (The restaurant is open literally all day.)",

    "text": "The Duck and Waffle is situated on the 40th floor of Heron Tower, right in close proximity to the Liverpool Street Tube Station. On entry to the imposing glass building, my companion and I were greeted by a bouncer with a furry sort of scarf wrapped around his neck, who promptly checked for IDs. We then waited for our turn in the infamous glass lift, which shot up into the sky smoothly--we went in at 11:00 PM, and the city was dotted with dazzling little ants of light. It feels swanky, but not in an uptight and stuffy way. The vibes are young--the way into the actual restaurant is snaky and not-straightforward, and includes walking past an impressive bar display that screams to impress. I know this because I tried very hard to be unimpressed as I stomped by in my heels, and could not stop sneakily glancing at the perfectly placed limes and lemons and shakers and fruits and bottles upon bottles of alcohol.we were seated immediately--the walls are entirely glass and give stunning views of Mthe city. Everyone is drinking. The wine menu and the cocktail menus are both \u00a0insane--I saw some 4-digit price tags that made me throw up in the back of my mouth a little bit, and quickly turned to the page with the more reasonably (but oho, dont get too ahead of yourself here, not THAT reasonably) priced 13-14 pound cocktails.The server s were quick, efficient, and friendly. My companion had a Japanese bottled Asahi for 7 pounds, while I pondered throwing away the equivalent of 20 American dollars on a cocktail. It was a no go, I sipped my tap water daintily and pretended it was as glamorous as any ridiculously priced drink.We began with the rosemary garlic bread--amazingly fresh--I could taste the small studs of sea salt--went amazingly with the buttery texture.The duck and waffle was exactly that--crispily roasted duck served atop a half Belgian waffle, served with a tiny little pitcher of maple syrup. Oh, and with a duck egg as well. It was delicious, but there was nothing extraordinary about it. It was well-cooked, but lacked the magic that I expected.My companion had the smoked salmon--this was an amazingly cut, fresh smoked salmon that melted in the mouth, served with slices of flatbread, some watercress salad, and creme fraiche.Overall, the food was excellent. I couldn't shake the vibes that I was finally in one of the 'hip-and-happening' areas of London--the service was meticulous and the views were amazing. Although I gripe about the prices, I knew I was paying for the ambience and the experience, which were truly fantastic.One piece of criticism that I will leave is that the all-day menu should try to be a little more cohesive in its pricing and selection. There are small plates with things like ox cheek and smoked mozzarella and aubergine around 9-10 pounds, and the 'for the table' section served the duck and waffle for 17 pounds and a pearl barley entree for 13 pounds, but then jumps to 30-40 pound entrees like chicken and steak. I would like to see a menu with a few more staples with less of a jump in pricing, and it might bring in an even more enthusiastic clientele than it already has. Excellent experience.",

    "text": "So I've been wanting to try this place for a while, but being incapable of planning my life two months in advance at the moment, hadn't gotten around to having sufficient forethought to book. So while browsing availability online and coming across a 10.00am slot just a week ahead, I pounced! And then Yee Gan was kind enough to provide the perfect company.Having already promised I'd order something more interesting than granola :) and being in a mood for an indulgent and leisurely brunch, we ordered a selection of dishes to share, including the Colombian eggs with avocado and smoked salmon, the foie gras with nutella, and of course, the eponymous duck & waffle.We were asked whether we wanted salt, pepper, or tabasco added to the Colombian eggs, and opted to have them as they came, but really we should have gone for the seasoning as they needed some kind of kick to add interest. The foie gras was my favourite (good choice Yee Gan!) and was really rich and yummy. And the duck and waffle with fried egg and the mustard (couldn't really taste it) maple syrup was also very good.We finished off with poached peaches (some perhaps a teeny bit under poached) with tarragon cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche sorbet (a delicious palate cleanser). I was a bit non-plussed by the accompanying white chocolate & pistachio biscotti - perhaps they were just too thin and crunchy to have sufficient taste. I prefer my biscotti thick and crumbly and good for dunking in coffee. I thought the service seemed a little bit perfunctory and lacking in engagement. Our waiter wouldn't get off the fence and share his favourite dish - come on, no-one loves everything equally! And our waitress, while very smiley and sweet, had no idea what made the Colombian eggs Colombian (it seems to be the addition of tomatoes and scallion to scrambled egg). And while they couldn't take our drinks and initial order quick enough when we sat down, after that, they didn't seem too interested in following up.At the end of the meal I randomly found myself pondering what I made of the ceiling tiles - while I liked the quirky bright yellow wave, I couldn't help wondering whether the marks where intentionally distressed, or just grubby. But unless diners regularly throw their food up in the air, I'll assume the former - although who knows what happens at 3.00am in the morning! I would definitely return and there are still plenty of other things on the menu I'd like to try. Plus the view is great and the speedy lift ride makes for a fun entrance and exit!",

    "text": "You've probably heard enough of this place, about how stunning the view is and about it's glorious duck & waffle but for all the hype, it's actually pretty good! I usually hate these gimmicky, reservation-only places where you visit once just to say you've been because the food's never worth coming back for. I've been here 3 times now!They do a good job. It's nothing super polished but always a satisfyingly unexpected mix of tastes/textures. I love the pigs ears!!! Crunchy and idk what they put in that bbq seasoning but it tastes so good! The oxtail doughnut was also nomz, it looks like a massive scotch egg but inside's stewed oxtail and the doughnut's been rolled in brown sugar. Seems so weird but tasty tasty with the apple jam! And the DUCK & WAFFLE. Yes. It's good. The waffle + duck + fried egg + maple syrupy goodness should go into your mouth at the same time, crispy bits from the duck and egg mixing with the spongy waffle and firmness of the duck meat, dripping in syurp. NOMZ. Forget the overpriced drinks, the desserts are forgettable but this. is. good.",

    "text": "I present to the yelp world, my 100th review!And it had to be for something I found to be absolutely spectacular. Duck and Waffle, ladies and gents, is absolutely spectacular, and one of the best places I've been to since moving to this fair city a year ago.Right, so... the view. \u00a0Everyone has talked about the view, but I can't not talk about the view because ohmygosh, is it amazing. \u00a0After emerging from the tube station, I thought \"well, this is a fairly corporate business-y area... where on earth is this restaurant going to be?\" \u00a0Luckily, google maps led me right to it, and I found the famed lift going to the 40th floor with ease. \u00a0Imagine the view from St. Paul's. \u00a0Now make it higher. \u00a0Now take away the copious amounts of stairs you have to climb at St. Paul's to get a view that isn't quite as high. \u00a0Yeap. \u00a0The view is amazing. \u00a0And panoramic. \u00a0And there isn't a bad seat in the house.Equally, there isn't a bad morsel in the house. \u00a0Grant and Tom, bad influences extraordinaire, and I ordered copious amounts of food as we wanted to sample everything. \u00a0Grant's given the list, but here it is again: crispy pig ears, foie gras all day breakfast, ox cheek doughnut, bacon wrapped dates, and the namesake... duck and waffle. \u00a0There wasn't a bad thing on the table. \u00a0Not one. \u00a0The bacon wrapped dates, I might add, are stuffed with chorizo. \u00a0And my goodness they're delicious. \u00a0Maybe my favorite thing aside from the duck and waffle itself. \u00a0I was super impressed with the crispy pig ears, which were actually crispy and not gross and gelatinous like I'd had at a yelp extreme eating event. \u00a0I kept going back to the little paper bag for more! \u00a0Said paper bag, by the way, wax sealed a la ye olde days with red wax and a duck and waffle stamp.The duck and waffle is not to be missed! \u00a0Quarter waffle on bottom, generously sized duck thigh/leg on top, gorgeously fried duck egg on top of that, pour mustard maple syrup all over and get to grubbin'. \u00a0Oh, the mustard maple syrup. \u00a0And oh, that crispy duck. \u00a0There are no words. \u00a0It must be tried. \u00a0Simply must.Duck and Waffle is extremely popular, but for those with the transport options, is open 24/7 so there are often odd timed reservations available. \u00a0Book ahead, and enjoy. \u00a0I plan to return. \u00a0I plan to return a lot.",

    "text": "I agree with most of the comments here. A meal here is simply great fun, with the zippy glass elevator ride up to the 40th floor and tremendous views. These are probably even more interesting than those at the Shard as you are looking down directly on the Gherkin and other landmarks of interests.The restaurant itself was busy and buzzy at 9pm on a Saturday. The staff were efficient and friendly, explaining the menu without being too pushy. Others have told me that they felt hurried through their meal (perhaps in preparation for the next sitting?) but we had no such problems. It's small plate food for sharing but there was a long-ish wait before the duck and waffles arrived. They also warn you that the roast chicken takes 40 minutes, which I actually felt was encouragingly indicative of things being cooked to order.Anyway, highly enjoyable in all respects. Would definitely recommend for a fun night out. Certainly preferable to Sushisamba downstairs, which comes across much worse for atmosphere in spite of the outside bar.",

We arrived at around 3 in the afternoon, dressed in sweaters and jeans ( mind you its the end of summer). However we were quickly turned away bc we were told they had a dress code. At 3 pm in the afternoon, at restaurant that is open 24/7, we didnt expect our dress to be in issue at this particular time of day.... However, we quickly learned that unlike other tourist areas that accept tourist dress, this place didnt and sandles/flip flops are NOT allowed. Disappointed, we left bc honestly if you dont want our money someone else does.... We decided how about heading to the Breakfast Club and making a visit to see the Mayor.... Those of you whom are local know what we are speaking of..those whom are not..give it a try... What started as a disappointing day ended up being a blast!!",

The caramelised onion bread was undercooked, and the anchovies on top just did not go well. The beetroot and honeycomb was too sweet. The asparagus was dull. The ox cheek doughnut was the most acceptable dish but still nothing to shout about. The pollock meatballs lacked any seasoning.The signature dish of duck and waffle was not impressive. The baked alaska for dessert was perhaps better than the rest. All in all, this restaurant was disastrous.",

Like any restaurant set in these surroundings it comes at a cost, however I was pleasantly surprised that my bill was only \u00a3160 for 4 people with a sharing Menu and no alcoholic drinks. We ate loads of different dishes and I felt it was a well valued meal. The Tuna dish was first class as were all the others apart from the coal charred aubergine..... slightly gooey and tasteless (wasn't a winner on our table). The whole experience was excellent and the staff were very professional. Only bear-bug is finding the right floor as its not evident when you get in the lift and a lot of customers end up in Sushi Samba. The elevator is like a rocket, so if you're afraid of heights its so quick that you don't have enough time to panic!!I'll be back!",

We went mostly for the view (which did not disappoint), but were caught of guard by the high quality of the food and excellent service. It was clear that waiting staff were of a high calibre but at no point did they come over as snobby, or make us feel uncomfortable as in some similar places. I had the signature duck and waffle dish which was a great combination (although the duck was slightly overcooked), my friend had the angus burger which was nicely rare and very tasty. Again I cannot emphasise enough the how incredible the view is, highly recommended.",

Shall I send you a box of bisquick from the US? Learn how to make the staple in your name. You got the making it look pretty part down but taste not so much.

We shared rabbit, bass, lentils and rosemary garlic bread with two friends. I actually wish it wasn't family style because it sometimes gets awkward when you want to pick up a bone and eat it dry but everyone around you is being a shy eater. Presentation was stunning, our server and the red wine was fantastic. I am really looking forward to revisiting d&w and enjoying the posh ambiance.",

I ordered the duck & waffle as well as the oxtail benedicts. Both were delicious.Duck & Waffle (5/5): The duck was crispy, the waffle had great texture, and the sauce was very unique. It had something that tasted like horseradish but it went well with the maple syrup.Oxcheek Benedicts (5/5): Sauce, meat, and eggs went well together.The only complaint I have was the service. The waiter was not very attentive and never came to check up on us or refill water after we ordered our food.",

Everything was so easy and smoothly to make reservations with these guys, so efficient! 5 stars there!On the day of our reservation, when we arrived, we weren't super pleased with the service from guys greeting us downstairs to hostess bringing u to our table. A little snobbiness in their way... The weirdest part was when we had a server who introduced himself to us and then left for the entire duration of our visit and reappeared right before dessert. And where we were not too pleased with service is when this server took our order for a bottle of ros\u00e9 and we never got it because he was MIA... So we had food and no drinks for a while.. And the other guys were not helpful in finding our server.Anyhow, for food we got 4 small plates to share and 2 orders of duck and waffle. Food was delicious, it was so well done (5stars here too). We really enjoyed the foie gras br\u00fbl\u00e9e and octopus. The duck was crispy and worked really well with the waffle. To top it off, you are dining on 40th floors of this building and get a beautiful view of the city of London!!",

The hostess contained that they \"tried to call\" even though it was noted on the reservation that the phone number I provided was not a U.K. number. The hostess was incredibly rude and insulting. My advice to Duck and Waffle- Treat your customers with decency and kindness. Advice for potential customers- skip this one.

And this place does not disappoint. The view is outstanding and almost as good as the London Eye. Of course, the hero of this place is the food, and my oh my was the food delicious. Reservations are needed, and I recommend calling them because their online system is inconsistent. Oh, and also there is a dress code - smart casual, no sneakers or ripped jeans please. Food: 5/5We had the following:their signature dish, duck and waffle, it is a chic take on the Southern class, chicken and waffle. This was my favorite dish because it combined sweet with savory. A fried duck leg is placed on top of a waffle, which is topped off with a runny egg. The maple syrup is served on the side. Delish! ox cheek benedict, this was the favorite of the men in our group. It was a rich and savory dish, combining that sweet tender soft cheek meat with the creaminess of hollandaise. Do not forget to spread some sriracha on there, because that is the critical piece that elevates this dish to the next level. spicy ox cheek donut, this was an interesting blend of mostly savory with hints of sweetness and tangyness. Service: 5/5Super attentive and friendly staff. One of them even jokingly told me he spiked my juice with vodka. Atmosphere: 5/5Very nice and chic, from the glass elevantor going up, to the incredible cocktail bar. It feels lik the IT place in town, of course, this view also helps. Oh right, they are also open 24 hours a day. Value: 4/5Yes, it is on the expensive side but for about the price of a London Eye ticket you get delicious food and a view, which isn't a bad deal at all. Main dishes were just under 20GBP, so with drinks and some shared dishes, it would be around 30GBP.",

The crispy skinned duck with the maple syrup and waffle paired quite well. \u00a0The wine selection was spot on for the menu items and the service was fairly good for London standards. \u00a0For dessert we went with the baked Alaska. While it wasn't served flaming, it was still decedent. \u00a0We topped of dinner with a cappuccino made to order. The prices are on the higher end, but the overall experience makes it well worth it. We will certainly be back! Tip: make reservations way in advance and be prepared because service can get slow.",

    "text": "I can't quite understand what would get someone to open a 24-hour restaurant, but Duck & Waffle has become a popular spot for birthday breakfasts, especially when you work in the City. I came here for a 6 AM reservation on one such occasion, and while I didn't make the reservation myself, I suspect that we were only able to get something that early because it is reportedly very busy for normal breakfast time (i.e. work breakfasts and such). At the time we were dining, there were only a few other occupied tables, and the staff were mopping the floors and doing other admin tasks around the restaurant. This was before Daylight Savings Time, and though it was cloudy, the general intent was also to see the sun rise, which happened shortly after 6 AM. The view is impeccable and among the best in London.As for the food, I had the Duck & Waffle because it was my first time at the restaurant and it had to be done. It's pretty much as it sounds, and certainly a very unique dish, but what I also thought was interesting was that they had mustard seeds in the syrup, though they didn't add a harsh bite. What really called to me was the duck egg en concotte, which my friend ordered and the smell of truffle really got me. I will definitely get that next time. They also have some standard things like eggs benedict, eggs with toast, etc. Since they serve food all day, I know people come for other meals in the day as well, but I'm not sure if any of the other dishes are quite as notable. The view is great but can be enjoyed from the Sushi Samba bar, for which it's generally possible to get in without a reservation.",

    "text": "To celebrate our last night in London our friend made reservations (two months in advance) for this posh and trendy restaurant overlooking the London Skyline.Taking a glass escalator to the top of one of London's tallest skyscrapers may be a bit of a hardship for anyone afraid of heights but phobia aside the culinary experience makes a trip to the 40th story worthwhile. For drinks, the Roasted Cosmo and Red Bell Pepper Bellini's were favorites, but the real star of the night was the duck and waffle (think chicken and waffle except with crispy roast duck, flavorful but not overly sweet sesame maple syrup, and a fried duck egg to bring it all home). The glazed lamb breast, roasted octopus (my personal favorite with its meaty chunks of octopus paired with potatoes), the artichoke and parmesan bread, and Pollock meatballs with lobster sauce were delicious. However, would hold off on the yellowfin tuna as portion size was meagre. Desert was hot chocolate and a shared plate of fancy French toast. Buzzing with well-heeled London professionals, be prepared to pay as the meal plus drinks are not cheap. Service is polite and brisk, accommodating as they moved our seat closer to the window, but not outstanding. If you are just interested in the bar, hours are late and reservations are not required but recommended to be guaranteed a seat/table.",

    "text": "This review is only in regards to the entrance host/reception. Unfortunately I was not able to dine at the restaurant so I can not comment about restaurant service or food.In London for 3 weeks for business, I've been pretty much making my way down all the recommended restaurants on some of the top restaurant lists. So after reading some positive reviews about this restaurant, I decided I would check it out. My colleague and I had just gotten back from Germany the day before, so we did not have any reservations, but we decided to try our luck. We decided to visit before lunch today (Thursday, Feb 18). Since I've checked on Google the time that the restaurant can get busy for lunch, we decided we should arrive before the noon rush (According to Google, their peak lunch hours were noon-2pm). So my colleague and I arrived around 11:30 (give or take) and at first we walked past it. Then we circled back and saw the entrance. There was no line or any other customer there. I saw only one person at the counter and I approached the male host on the first (aka ground) floor entrance. I believe he was busy looking over resumes or what look like them on his counter. We did the friendly greetings and I asked him if there were seating for 2 at Duck & Waffle? Without checking a reservation list, computer, or anything, he quickly said, \"No, sorry, we are completely booked.\" Ok - well, I understand: it could be one of those fully booked Thursday. He told me that I can just come back later and try again. So I asked him what would be a good time to come back? In 30 minutes? An hour? Is there an estimated time I can try again? He just kinda looked at me without an answer and instead said, \"Here, why don't you call to make a reservation\" (or something along those lines) as he proceeded to grab a business card on the counter. As he was about to the grab a card (there were two business card holders on the counter - one for sushi and another for duck), he then suddenly asked me, \"What restaurant was it you want?\" I told him \"Duck & Waffle\" again and he grabbed the \"Duck & Waffle\" card and handed to me.I thanked him and left, however when I went out, something just doesn't quite add up in my mind. From not looking at the list, no estimated time frame to check back and especially the last question really boggled my mind?! I felt like something was just off.It was a short encounter but it just felt like the whole thing was a half-@ss attempt to deny access. He answered quickly and confidently when I asked him about a table in the beginning, yet less than a minute later, he forgot which restaurant I wanted to get a table at? Were both restaurant fully booked for Thursday lunch? Even so, he forgot which one so quickly? Not only that, usually a host can give a rough estimate of when to try back or they will straight up tell you, no way in hell you will get in without a reservation way ahead of time (think French Laundry, Jiro, Noma etc.) So I decided to check up on the reviews in regards to the receptionist/front desk/host related comments and it seems quite a few people have some negative things to say about it. If I wasn't dress up up to the nines - fair enough, let me know. If you need a reservation months ahead of time - fair enough, just tell me. So after feeling like the host was just half-@ssing it - I decided to share my opinion of the encounter with the host. Again, this review is not about the food and food service, since I did not have the chance to try it.",

    "text": "We're given a fistful of menus - bunch, all day, cocktail and wine. I'd already decided to have the Duck & Waffle (\u00a317), which is under the 'For the table' section of the menu along with a 400g Yorkshire Rib Eye (\u00a335) and Whole Roasted Honey Glazed Ham Hock (\u00a326) amongst others, although it's not really big enough to share and once you've tasted it, you won't want to! The combination of crispy skin, confit leg, waffle, runny egg yolk and a dip in to the pot of mustard maple syrup was incredible! As good a mouthful of food as you'll ever have.Antonia had the Duck Egg en Cocotte (\u00a310), which came in it's own little pan covered in wild mushrooms, truffle and melted gruy\u00e8re with a stack of soldiers willing to sacrifice themselves for the cause. Not exceptional but a solid dish none the less and surprisingly filling given it's size.We also had a portion of BBQ Spiced Crispy Pig Ears (\u00a35), which, unexpectedly came in a super cool brown paper bag with a duck seal. Once you rip it open you see a pile of thin, crispy pig ears that look like a game of pick-up-sticks. They're really crispy as you'd expect and the BBQ seasoning is pretty decent. They're kind of what I hoped the pork scratchings at Barbecoa would be like.Considering you'll spend about the same amount as a ticket to go on the London Eye or up The Shard but have some delicious food and better views, Duck & Waffle is great value. The service was excellent throughout our vist and they recently announced that it would be open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. I've no idea how much trade they do in the small hours but next time I'm in the area at stupid o'clock I may well popup for a drink, snack and another look at those views.",

Still, I really do recommend this place for visitors to London. You can get cocktails at the bar without a reservation and I imagine the food will be good enough despite those two incidents.",

It's not required, but it's good to be prepared \u00a0because they get busy! You also have to see a host and check in before they will even let you get on the elevator to go to the 40th floor. My husband and I split the duck and waffle and the gnocchi dish. They were both phenomenal. As other reviewers have mentioned, I was skeptical about the duck and waffle combination, but it is a perfect duo. The duck is flavorful and crispy, and the waffle is thick.

    "text": "Due to my EPIC failure I had to award a five star. I have never been until now but on what I have read on yelp, I knew I must try the actual duck and waffle dish they are famous for. I ordered the bacon wrapped dates that were stuffed with chorizo which added to the soft textured dates and the crunch of the bacon. The sweet and salty combination just works and was a hit that went down a treat. The second dish was the n'duja & gruy\u00e8re pizzeta which was a thin baked tomato and cheese pizza that had hot spots of chillie that woke your mouth up. The pizza was nice and crunchy and was a real good share on the table. The next plate was the 400g USDA ribeye with bone marrow butter that had hints of garlic a and added herbs that really push the flavours and makes you understand the phrase 'melts in your mouth like butter'. The ribeye was cooked to fantastic perfection and made to the chefs preference of medium which I was convinced was medium rare, either way it was a luscious cut of meat and the size was good enough to share baring in mind we have ordered a few dishes. By the time I was devouring the ribeye I quickly realised how much I was enjoying the food as my body hit the wall, the food wall. This was the point my body was drunk from the protein hit of the ribeye, the sweet and crunchy taste of the bacon wrapped dates. I was now beginning to regret I put I a lot of energy into the thin crust pizza earlier, but before I was aloud to wallow in my own shameful self pity the waiters then brought out the hara bhara lamb cutlets which was accompanied by a smooth rich smoked aubergine. I was dizzy, sweating holding the edge of the tables thinking what the hell have I done. Then I utter the words I despise, 'do you have a takeaway box'. I was defeated by the ribeye and lamb cutlet combo, I had reluctantly thrown in the towel to surrender to this magnificent food tasting dinning experience. Then it happened, the waiter brought their glorious trademark signature dish, yes the duck and waffle which came with the beautiful mustard seed syrup. And that's when it happened, my eyes were activated \u00a0they did truly became bigger than my belly and something happened that only really happens in rare occasions when I'm truly experiencing an over whelming eating sensation my second stomach was ready to eat, somehow my body found room to ingest more rich and glorious food, I pick the fork up and it was back on!Their was no way I was leaving here without trying this signature dish which I began by dividing it into two equal parts which was shared with my wife, then I poured over the mustard seed syrup and began devouring. I quickly realised why this was special. It was the balance of full on flavours and texture. The rich saltiness of the duck that was also really crispy on the outside and succulently soft which brilliantly went well with the spongy crunch of the partially sweet baked waffle. The real sweetness came from the mustard seed syrup which was a rich hit of mourishly golden goodness. The only real disappointment is that I had a big full rack of ribs, fries and onion rings a few hours earlier at TGIfridays. I will not be making this fatal floor again I will be going back to the duck and waffle prepared and continue this eternal eating battle where this time 'I WILL NOT PUT THE FORK DOWN UNTIL I HAVE WON'PS. I will be eating my takeaway box in loving memory of this amazing night out.",

As I was a newbie here I went for the traditional Duck & Waffle and was not one bit disappointed - absolutely delicious! The duck, waffle and egg with the sweet mustardy syrup hit the spot bang on the head! Definitely a combination of flavours that had me going \"Oooh yes yes yes!\" Fortunately I went with ppl who'd eaten there before and got to try the Ox cheek doughnut - (yum!) and the breads with the different cheese toppings - (heavenly yum!)Definitely come here!

The views going up the elevator were amazing, although a little vertigo inducing!We were seated immediately and the servers had no problem seating us at a window seat. We ordered a bottle of wine and the rosemary, garlic bread to start with. The bread was fresh and the garlic was roasted, breaking into a spreadable garlicy paste when cut into with a knife.Next we ordered the bacon wrapped dates. This was my favourite meal of the night! The meatyness of the dates meshed well with the bacon, and the salad garnish and honey mustard sauce really complimented the meaty flavours with their crisp clean taste. The scallops and the venison carpaccio from the raw section were ok. There was more apple then scallops (it looked like they cut one single scallop into 5 small pieces) and the venison, again was quite small. I did like the salt blocks they brought them out on.Next course was the artichoke stew and the mutton sloppy joe. The artichoke stew was cooked very nicely, the corn and beans worked well. The mutton on the sloppy joe was delicious, however I wish there were pickles, or coleslaw, or something to add a little crunch to the sandwich. It was just the meat and the bread and the texture was a bit mushy.The duck and waffle were very nice! I normally am not a fan of duck, however the duck was very tender and not too game-y. The waffle was also cooked well. After another bottle of wine we ordered the cheese selection and the assorted sweets. Both were nice, but the cracker to cheese ratio was off.. need to add more crackers!The service was amazing. Everyone was very attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. The views were gorgeous as well.",

All of this came to 100 pounds for the two of us with tip included.Considering the normal rip-off prices for mediocre food when you dine at the top of skyscrapers, this is actually pretty good. Some of the food dishes were five-star worthy (ox doughnut, duck egg, duck and waffle) even at street-level and nothing other than the winelist was over 15 pounds. Service was great as well, with some pzzazz provided by the cocktail staff doing things like the Sazerac (try it!) and taking photos of plebs like us.We went at 6pm on a Friday with a booking made 3 weeks earlier. The glass elevator up to the 40th floor and the view from staircase wrapping up around the bar were definite highlights (as was the ear-popping elevator drop back down). We got a great table for two up against the glass with a 600ft drop right down to Liverpool St station and watched toy buses winding around Shoreditch in the distance. Those with tables for 3, 4 or more end up stuck in the middle away from the windows but with a lovely ceiling to admire.The plates are pretty small, so don't expect to fill up to bursting point, but do expect some creative plates even if they don't all taste Michelin level. If you just want the view, you can actually come from breakfast, lunch or even midnight snacks. Duck and Waffle really IS 24 hours! You'll probably still need a reservation as it's crazy popular right now (Autumn 2012) but you can just drop by for a cocktail at the bar without a booking. As for us... we're now planning an East-viewing table for 7am in December. I want the sun to rise over Essex and land on my penthouse breakfast!",

What guilty pleasure!- Rosemary & Garlic bread.- The cocktails!!!Cons:- Booking is a must and a month or two in advance for the regular/normal/popular meal hours!

You'll get the view, and a meal for pretty much the same price tag. The first time I went here I didn't have a reservation. Although it was a busy Saturday night, they had exactly one table left with an outstanding view of the city. We could see the Gherkin, the Shard and the London Bridge from our table, just beautiful. The staff was very welcoming. The second time around some of the staff was rather inattentive, which bothered me a bit. The food and the view make up for this though. I really recommend the Duck & Waffle, of course. Other dishes we had were the foie gras and the smoked salmon. Their desserts are divine too, if you already had the duck & waffle, don't go for a waffle dessert; it's too much I think. The cocktails are pretty pricey, as they are more expensive than most of the food items on the menu (\u00a315, whereas most items are only around or less than \u00a310, only the D&W is \u00a317). But, I guess you're paying for the view too. If you're celebrating something they'll give you some bonbons on the house.4/5",

    "text": "Most of the stuff I will say here has already been said, but I'd like to reconfirm. First, the setting. Shooting up the elevator above all of the lights of the city is a pretty cool feeling. Then the bar seemed like a nice spot with a view view straight out to the gherkin. They could put more seats in the bar- the tenders stand around a large table on the middle with all of there ingredients and make drinks there. After about ten minutes we were ushered to our seats for dinner. We somehow scored the corner table looking northwest- a very nice view indeed. Perfect setting for dinner. The dining room was modern and rustic at the same time with an open kitchen. Next the drinks. Cocktails were \u00a314 each so instead we ordered a glass of Malbec (\u00a310 for 125 ml) and an asahi (\u00a37 for a bottle). Both were standard, but at those prices, it wasn't a place to booze up. Next the food: Ox cheek donut- seems to be the signature entree, a large! Cinnamon coated pastry with apricot sauce and spicy meat on the inside. This was big enough for two split. Really good entree. Glad we did not let the waiter up sell us to get bread as the bread looked disappointing. Duck and waffle- the namescape dish, the duck confit was perfect- crispy portions with skin. Went well with the waffle it sat atop and the syrup enhanced the flavor once you poured it on. It also came with an egg, which seemed overkill. Would rather have more syrup. Jerusalem artichoke ravioli- the surprise star of the night- rich cinnamon and buttery flavor with (I guess) truffle (can't say I can ever tell truffle...), but nevertheless this was the dish I wished I had more of. All the dishes were heavy, rich, flavorful, and filling. They all had sweet tinges to them, meaning we didn't need dessert. Overall a great experience. Would recommend it to most anyone once, but the value is more in the food than the drinks.",

I split it with my friend so we could order some appetizers for variety as well. The violet artichoke & Parmesan was incredible. I highly recommend it! The bread was very fluffy and delicious. We had a raw tuna special appetizer that was also delicious. We also ordered two polentas, which were good. The view was incredible! (I cannot believe we got a window seat!) The service was extremely attentive and friendly. I wrote that it was my friend's birthday dinner. They brought us a small biscuit and wrote happy birthday in chocolate on a tray. She was thrilled! It was a lovely evening. I thought it would be more expensive than it was, it was around 38p each.",

    "text": "Hands down, one of the best meals I've had in London. From the booking process all the way through leaving the building, the service was impeccable. When I made my reservation I mentioned that my parents were coming in from America and the dinner was sort of a belated birthday meal for myself and my mother, and requested a table with a view. Obviously they can't promise good weather, but the guy said he'd see what he could do with regard to a window view. When we arrived, there was a small queue for the lift (to the side of the main entrance) but we mentioned having a reservation at Duck and Waffle and were immediately told to go in. It sounded like the doorman almost doubles as a bouncer, picking and choosing who goes in - if you don't have a reservation, that is!We were whisked - yes, whisked on a super fast lift - up to the top, the 40th floor. Unfortunately we only arrived just in time for the booking, otherwise we would have stopped for a cocktail. The cocktail bar looked amazing - a bar set up in the centre of the room like a buffet with bar staff making gorgeous looking drinks out of super fresh ingredients. Anyway, we walked through the cocktail bar to the restaurant for our meal. Oh, and the guy who I asked for a table with a view? Boy, did he deliver! We had a table in the corner, which is perfect when you're surrounded by glass walls. As for the food: delicious. No, really. I'll break down what we got:- freshly baked house bread served warm with butter and olive oil. Good, but definitely the worst part of the meal. It didn't have anything special to it, but that's ok: the food got so much better from there.- raw yellowfin tuna served on a salt block with a bit of watermelon, balsamic, and basil. so so so good, and the salt block added a touch of saltiness to the watermelon, which is always a good thing. - pearl barley and mushroom ragout served with goat curd and a 63 degree hen egg. That egg, by the way, is the only reason I pushed for us to order this - I'd never had one, but heard how good it was. And, yes, it was delicious. So was the pearl barley and the goat curd. I actually don't really like mushrooms (ever since a terrible case of food poisoning last year) but surprisingly enjoyed this one. - seared scottish scallops served with mussels and mashed potato in seaweed and saffron broth. Absolutely delicious. It only had 2 each of the mussels and scallops, and I didn't get to try the scallops, but the rest was really really good. There was a sweetness in the mash, but a saltiness in the broth and it worked really well together.- fois gras creme brulee with lobster. I didn't try this one, so I can't speak to it. My father was the only one of us who ate it and, while he loved it, he said he wouldn't order it again if he was the only one eating it because it was so rich (well, yeah. it's fois gras!). I did pick the lobster off the dish, which was yummy, and he did mention it was fois gras with the texture of a creme brulee dessert, so take from that what you will. - the duck and waffle. yes, of course we got this! we got two, in fact! and i can't even tell you. seriously, mouth orgasm. the melding of flavours - savoury duck leg, soft and subtly sweet waffle, perfectly fried duck egg, strangely addicting mustard maple syrup - it all worked so well together. The only thing I'd say is that there was too little egg, I think - I \"ran out\" of egg halfway through. Then again, two eggs would probably be a bit much. If you go here and do not order this, I think you're sorely missing out. We then decided that, as delicious as the meal was, we had to get dessert. Right. Torrejas and petit fours it is. It was my first time having torrejas - basically, a dessert \u00a0version of french toast (or eggy bread for some of you) which they served with slices of (baked?) apple in a caramel-type sauce and a scoop of cinnamon ice cream - and I absolutely loved it. The fact that I love french toast obviously helps here. The petit fours were alright, not to my taste (except for one, a coconut marshmallow thing) - but as there were only 6 of them and 3 of us, my parents were happy to finish those. I thought serving them in a dish on a bed of candied nuts was a really great touch....Until they brought out a dish with 3 more petit fours sitting on top a smear of what may have been marshmallow fluff with \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate syrup. Yum.The whole meal - including 2 coffees, a tea, 2 bottles of water and a bottle of wine - came to just under 200 GBP. It's not cheap, but it was worth it. It's rare you get a restaurant that has delicious food when it's in such a prime location. The view was remarkable, the food was wonderful, and the staff were great. What more could you ask for in a restaurant?",

Assuming you get a bit lucky and can snag a peak reservation, the atmosphere at Duck & Waffle is sensational. High above the city with panoramic views, the atmosphere itself is worth it, and the top notch service, refined yet flexible, make it such that you can enjoy those beautiful views without worrying about any inconveniences with respect to your meal. Star Granted. Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?Beauty and quality come at a cost, and this is London after all, but I was honestly flabbergasted that my flagship Duck & Waffle dish came to only \u00a315.00. Granted the dish isn't very big, with half a waffle and only a single piece of duck, but even after I'd tacked on a side of sausage and some coffee I was only just over \u00a320.00 before tax and tip. Given the quality and presentation of it all this was well worth the expense. Star Granted. Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?I maybe have duck every other month in some form or fashion, but I really do enjoy it, and the duck here at Duck & Waffle was excellent. While you've a bit of a chore on your hands surgically removing the meat from the bone, skin, etc. the process could be rather easily done with just a fork and knife and the flavor was tremendous. The waffle was excellent, and the mustard seed maple syrup was the real gem here, with a sweetness and tangy factor that reminded me a bit of carolina barbecue atop a waffle of all things. Also of note was the fantastic side of sausage that I got, which was some of the best breakfast sausage I've had. Dual Stars Granted. Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?It's impossible to say no here - Duck & Waffle is a must-do in London whether you're visiting or live here. Star Granted.",

If you want to impress a date. It's a good place for that. The food looks good. We had a fresh bread starter that was delicious and the drink menu is fun and inventive. The negative... a bit pricey but understandable with the quality of food and drink they serve. It's more so the atmosphere was a bit superficial and I think it misses the mark. A bit Euro-Trashy for my taste. Techno music and rude host/Hostess. I think this place tries to go in too many directions. Then again I may not be the demographic they are aiming for.",

    "text": "I read a few of the one star reviews on here and they are spot on. I just returned from dinner here with my husband and we were both upset by the time we got seated. The entire experience getting up there ruined an already mediocre meal. We came into London yesterday with the reservation already made for dinner. The hostess was nice enough to call my husband twice to confirm the reservation which was nice. The first call was missed since we we're traveling from Amsterdam that morning. Fast forward to the reservation time on the ground level where we were \"greeted\" by two security/bouncer guys. \u00a0The Chinese group in front of us checked in before us and they asked the girl who well looked in her mid-20s to show ID or a passport. Keep in mind she was there with her parents. The dad had to look on his phone for a copy of her driver license while they looked for her passport. \u00a0I thought that was pretty odd but I ignored it. When it was our turn we gave them the name and reservation time. \u00a0Everything went downhill from there. The security dude asks if I read the confirmation email as if it was a pop quiz. We say yes since it was just a confirmation email. \u00a0Turns out that there is a dress code of \"casual elegance\" whatever that means. Why was this not brought up during the reservation confirmation if it was that important? \u00a0Anyway, we were out all day catching the New year's day parade so we had on trainers and regular clothes to stay warm and walk around comfortably. We are also tourists, not locals so it is not like we have our entire closet with us. The security dude talked to us like he's doing us a solid by letting it go this time, but next time don't do it again. Don't worry, there won't be a next time... We step up to the next security dude where he asks to check my bag when I am clearing not carrying any bag. My husband was carrying a small backpack with water, umbrella, etc to get us through the day. He tells us to throw out the brand new bottle of Evian water we just bought because drinks are not allowed. Wtf! \u00a0Are they going to lose money competing with a bottle of water? \u00a0It's already inside the bag so it's not like we plan to take it out to drink during the meal. We ended up tossing the bottle before we were allowed to go up the elevator. Once we got up to the restaurant, we had to walk past the bar to check in. We were told we're 15 minutes early, which we were, so check back with them later while we wait at their bar. \u00a0This was fine but we had to walk back to the host ourselves to check in again when it was time since no one approached us when it was time. \u00a0What type of wanna be fancy restaurant requires you to go check back with them again instead of having someone come get you at the bar? \u00a0Oh yeah, while we waited at the bar, we saw people dressed in sweaters, t-shirts, Nike tennis shoes, and other items not recommended to wear. \u00a0Did they all get warned? \u00a0I doubt it.We were both furious and even talked about leaving before we got seated but we ended up staying. We still had hope that the food would make up for experience we had to get seated. \u00a0The service from the waiter was good, the food overall was just ok to not that good. We ordered the \"homemade bread\" (important they point that out to you), pig ears, ox cheek donut, crab dish, duck & waffle, and rabbit. \u00a0The bread didn't have much flavor and it was difficult to cut with the butter knife that came with the bread. The knife was also brought to the table stuffed under the bread so the handle was greasy. Pig ears was ok. Tasted like a very crunchy bbq flavored potato chips from the supermarket. The ox cheek donut was disappointing since so many people raved about it. The donut itself didn't have much flavor. The meat had a hint of spiciness to it but you would never be able to taste it if you eat it with the sauce the donut rests on. The sauce was so overpowering that you could not taste the donut at all. The crab dish was a special for \u00a36 and it was actually good tastewise and price. \u00a0The rabbit was also a dish that used a strong sauce to give the rabbit more flavor but it was so much that you couldn't take the rabbit at all. Finally, the dish the restaurant is known for, the duck and waffle. The duck confit was ok. We had duck confit at a random Paris cafe last week and it tasted much better. We also went to Borough market yesterday and got the duck from Le Quartier du Marche which also taste way better than this. The waffle was a joke. It tasted the same as the waffles we make at home with our waffle maker. I'm not even comparing them to the waffles in Belgium. They had a light syrup with these small seeds in there that was weird. The egg on top was fine but the yolk should be a little bit more runny or else what's the point. Outside of the view, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. If you take away the location, do you think this place would be relevant at all?",

Service was fairly inattentive - it took ages for us to flag down our waiter for the bill, even after he cleared the last plate - but it wasn't exactly terrible to gaze at the city of London for a little longer. The Elvis waffle didn't disappoint - a massive, crispy waffle with a generous slathering of peanut butter, strawberry jam, fresh berries, and 2 hearty scoops of the most delicious vanilla cream. (Not for those on a diet). Mains were \u00a315 or less per plate.",

Cocktails aren't worth it - you could get another dish for the price of one only-okay drink.- Duck & waffle: you have to try it at least once. Do not argue with me about how it's \u00a317 or about how you don't like duck or that meat on the bone is too much work. Just do it.- Ox cheek doughnut: the perfect mix of savory & sweet.- Goat meatballs: very good.- Banana brulee waffle: I'm not a big fan of sweet breakfasts, but I loooooved this.- Shakshuka: good, but felt a little small and left me wanting second breakfast.- You can't go wrong with the breads, either. Always warm and fresh from the oven.Definitely make reservations in advance (you can do it online). I usually booked about a month ahead of time. If you go in the winter, be prepared for disappointment in case fog surrounds the restaurant and all you can see out the windows is a blanket of white.",

I was afraid that we would be turned away at the door. Instead, we were greeted with friendly smiles and a welcoming atmosphere. The reservation was for 8am and the place was half empty. We were immediately seated by the window with a nice view of the Tower Bridge and the Gherkin building. The waiter was very helpful and attentive. I ordered the namesake Duck and Waffle dish and a mimosa. The duck was well seasoned and crispy on the outside and the waffle was a bit over done. However, with a fantastic view and excellent service, I was able to over look it. The elevator ride was a treat!",

    "text": "I loved everything about our experience at Duck & Waffle! The elevator ride to the restaurant on the 40th floor is the first great thing. A fun perk! Obviously great views. And then you walk through to the restaurant and even more amazing views! And with their open floor plan it's easy to see in every direction. With it's easy enough to walk around other tables to snap a few pictures, even if they are busy (be mindful of others of course). We came for breakfast with an 8am reservation. I was surprised to see that there were already several tables filled already (mostly couples) but they weren't completely full yet. For food we had the Colombian Eggs and Full Elvis (the pb&j waffle), which I was worried would be too sweet, but was absolutely delicious!!! I will admit that I came here for the Instagram-worthy views but the food definitely held it's own. Waiter was friendly and left us to enjoy ourselves with the views. No pressure to give up our table after we finished eating, although I'm sure when it's really busy they enforce their 1-hour limit and encourage you to linger in the bar area instead.Tip: You can make reservations online but I learned that calling is the best way to find out their real availability. The online reservation doesn't always reflect exactly what reservations are open. I tried to book online first and it said they were book solid for the whole week but then I called and they had tons of availability. Also be sure to ask specifically for a window side table if possible. Views are great even if you don't get one but it never hurts!",

We tried each other dishes and they were really delicious.The wait staff were super friendly. \u00a0Since they open long hours, the waiter told us, this place is popular with tours who want to view the sunrise early in the morning whilst eating breakfast.Apparently they have a bar next door which does not require reservations, which also serves bits and drinks. \u00a0A great way to enjoy the fabulous view without spending a bunch of money.Would like to revisit again oneway.",

Knew that we are coming back to London and wanted to try this restaurant for real. husband made reservation 1 week in advance. With someone last minute cancellations, we got a 645pm golden hour reservation. From the elevator ride (hope you are not afraid of height and speed) to the stunning 360 view of London and the iconic duck & waffle (it is delicious) , I was impressed! Great wine selection as well ! (We had a bottle of South African chenin blanc, buttery with French oak but fruity with hind of green apple at the same time?) Wonderful service (we met manager Tania, she is caring and kind) we had a blast time. Images speak a thousand words, will attached some views from the restaurant. I highly recommended this place and yes! Book in advance!",

    "text": "So, first of all this place might not have the absolutely best food in the world....... BUT all things considered me and my wife just love Duck & Waffle! \u00a0We went here for brunch last summer and the first thing you notice is the exciting elevator the roughly 40 floors up where you have an amazing view of London. A pro tip is to make table reservation since the Place is popular and fills up fast. \u00a0I booked about 3 weeks before arrival wich was enough. \u00a0After checking the menu we started our brunch-Sunday with Bellinis and bbq spiced crispy pig ears. The Bellinis where really fresh and the pigs ears was a real little treat and came in a brown paper bag. \u00a0After the little starter snack we had these dishes: *Foie Gras Creme Brul\u00e9e with pork crackling brioche Fun idea with creamy luxurious foie gras that tasted really good with the soft brioche *Smoked eel with horseradish & samphire Subtle but tasty with this \u00a0thaonet was more towards a fine dining dish. *Spicy Ox Cheek Doughnut with Apricot jam & smoked paprika sugar WOW and DAMN IT! This one was nothing short of spectacular. The warm soft doughnut with a center of slow cooked ox cheek spiced just right against that sweet Apricot jam.....Mmmm i just wish a could have this dish every weekend. \u00a0*The Full Elvis Waffles with peanut butter, jam, banana and whipped cream. \u00a0Looked and tasted good though im not sure it was worth the 15 \u00a3 since its not too hard to replicate at home as some of the other dishes. \u00a0 The service was good and the food was quirky and tasty with lots of new combinations of flavors. A long with the view i would love to go back. With a price tag of about 130 \u00a3 with two Bellinis and two glass of house ros\u00e9 it doesnt come cheap. \u00a0Luckily for us we are not in London that often so will make sure to eat there the next time we are in town.",

We came for breakfast and we were seated by the window where the sunshine were directly in our face. My eyes were hurting and tearing up so we asked to change table. There was a table on the other side of the building. However, our host says no. Then we asked people to pull the blinds down a bit but it still didn't help much. Twenty minutes later, we asked our waiter and the manager eventually changed our table to the other side. The situation does not worth the hassle!Tip: - Reserve ahead of time!- Entrance: A small door by the building with the fish tank.",

It was an incredible experience but definitely wish we would have known more about it prior to coming in to eat.Open 24 hours- keep in mind unless it's anytime before midnight there is no use coming with no reservation.It's like a club or rave during the later part of the evening and most patrons are dressed to the nines. They apparently don't let you in the door at the floor to come up the elevator if you have on any sort of athletic trainer on, I.e., \u00a0Nike's. If we could redo our experience we would come for brunch as I'm sure this is when the best of the best is working and because you won't feel like you just went to Vegas. Our service was stellar once we finally got in. The restaurant itself is stunning. Duck and waffle don't disappoint along with the salty grilled cheese. Would love to see what we missed on their normal menu. The whole food and service and ascetic is killer. The late night experience of it all wasn't for us.",

I've been to duck and waffle twice for breakfast, and it still amazes me, it's the highlight of my London trip! I've tried their duck and waffle (5/5), full Elvis waffle (3/5) and caramelized banana waffle (4/5). (Ratings are in brackets). The duck and waffle - duck is very crispy on the outside, juicy and flavorful in the inside, the maple syrup and the sunny side up has compliment the duck so well as you taste savory and sweet both at once! Full Elvis isn't that worth it as it is just combination of fruits along with banana br\u00fbl\u00e9e creme, feel like I can get it in any other shop. The caramelize banana is a good choice for sweet tooth, loved the harden caramel/ sugar layer coated on the banana, which gives a sense of crunch and soft when you eat it.The view from the 40th floor is great, don't be shy to ask for a change of seats if you're not seated next to the window. The waiters are accommodating and will try to make good seat arrangement. Remember to make a booking before heading to the restaurant through their website, and book earlier for a reasonable time slot! (My friend tried to book last minute, and only left with the choice of 6am in the morning for weekend brunch)",

The food is quite good and not badly priced. I highly recommend the restaurant's namesake dish, the duck and waffles! It's quite sweet, especially if you drizzle all of the maple syrup, so take that as you will :) The crispy skin on the duck was perfection, as well, and deserved a mention here. I also really enjoyed the salted hazelnut choux bun for dessert. Ah, and for the small plates, I liked the lentils, which were sweet with a hint of miso, and the ox doughnut.NOW I must say something about the service. Our waiter was nice, but he definitely took down our order incorrectly. My group was served the corn dog small plate, when we had ordered the corn bread, but he insisted that we had ordered the corn dog and that it was on the ticket for proof. Well, of course it will be on the ticket if you took it down wrong! I was mainly surprised that he would not acknowledge the opinion of 6 people versus himself in what we had ordered... he basically forced us to eat and pay for the dish, adding on that the corn bread had also been ordered. However, the corn bread came out much later after the main dishes, and we saw on the bill that it was added later. Obviously, he had added it later after realizing his mistake but did not admit it to us. Quite disappointed with his service!!",

There was a bit of a mix-up with a group booking I had made a few weeks in advance for a special dinner. I believe there were miscommunications on both sides of the equation -- regardless, the reservation was cancelled, unbeknownst to me, so I rocked up with a group of 9 at 6:30pm on a Thursday evening....and no reservation. Eeeeeps. The manager, Rosario Cappiello, was nothing short of exceptional. Right away he was on the challenge, set us up at the bar for a few drinks while he resolved, found us a great table for 9 and checked in several times to ensure everything was going well. Far beyond expectations. I was so pleased and really thankful for his ability to problem solve. He easily could have said \"well, tough shit lady.\" -- but instead, he handled perfectly. His manner is also very calm and professional (of course, so is mine so that helps!). SO, thank you very much Rosario! Also, the food is SO great, the group menu is delicious and overly indulgent (I'm still full after 15 hours). The Eden cocktail highly recommended as well. Cheers!",

Zooming up to the 40th floor watching the view change was a promising start and it only got better. After a short and fun wait at the beautiful bar area enjoying the gorgeous view with a drink, we got seated. Although the dining area is not as stunning as the bar, they service was friendly and helpful and the FOOD. So. Good.Out of the starters we tried, I love the polenta starters the most. They come as fried balls with the yummiest creamy sauce that I would love to know the recipe for. The portion is small, just 2 little pieces, but they are worth it. The freshly baked rosemary bread was also quite nice if you're feeling snackish at the bar while you wait.Now the main course- the duck and waffle itself. I did not know duck could be so fantastic. It was succulent and both the crispy skin and the juicy meat inside were cooked to perfection. The waffle was great and went well with it. I'm not really into sweet food but I tried my syrup and it was actually pretty good with the rest, although I would have it in small doses. The duck and waffle are quite filling. All in all, with the great views, welcoming atmosphere, and fantastic food, I left extremely satisfied and happy.",

I highly recommend the maple glazed cornbread that has jalape\u00f1os baked in I was so surprised by the flavor but loved every bite.

He was professional but still down to earth! We then went inside and rode the elevator up I think 39 floors. What a sight to see! We were greeted by the hostess, super nice and then taken to our table. My cousin asked the hostess if by chance there were any tables available by the windows and after checking, she apologized, but said there weren't any. No worries b/c the view of the city is still visible no matter where you sit. \u00a0We placed our order and then next thing we knew, the server picked up our glasses and indicated that a table became available near the windows!!! We were so excited and the fact that they watched for an open table for us just gave them extra points in my book! Next the food... The menu had many items that looked good, but I opted for the Duck and Waffle. Can I say nom nom!!! It was so delicious and cooked perfectly!!! I didn't want the dish to end! As I write this review, my mouth waters for the tasty dish!!! Lol!!!One other thing that was a plus in my book is the server did not rush us. He allowed us to take our time and enjoy our meal and good conversation. I definitely have to go back to this restaurant when I visit London again! Bravo!",

Contrary to our expectations, the restaurant was not, in fact, full of drunk people snacking after a night out, and was in fact very classy.The duck & waffle dish deserves to be the name of this restaurant. The duck is crispy on the outside, all melting in your mouth on the inside, and goes perfectly with a morsel of the sunny-side-up egg and waffle, drizzled in maple syrup. There were some interesting cocktails. I got one that involves beet and chocolate, and it was very tasty. The \"English Cherry\" belgian waffle + ice cream combo dessert was a very sweet ending to a great late-night dinner.I'd love to visit again! Maybe for brunch next time.",

It is almost worth spending the extra cash as their renowned dish, the Duck and Waffle itself, is absolutely delicious. Sweet and savoury all mixed into one, it really is a yummy place to go. Their service wasn't as great as the food unfortunately, as we had to remind them our drinks order that was taking a bit longer than expected. The food did make up for the service, but it is a shame that when you are paying so much for the food, that the service doesn't reflect what you're paying.",

The view was AMAZING and so worth going up there for. Too bad there was a bit of condensation on the windows. The next time I go, I'll opt for a clear sunny morning!To start I had the BBQ spiced crispy pig's ears. These were yummy and so moreish. But the way it was served was a little startling. It was just a paper bag dumped onto the table. The waiter didn't even think to tell us what they'd given us. So a star down for that. My confit duck and waffle was of course the star of the night! It's served with a mustard maple syrup which was so good. The duck wasn't as tender as I'd preferred, but it was still enjoyable. The best part of the dish had to be the runny duck egg - which the waffle was perfect to slap up! As much as I enjoyed my meal, I did think it was a bit much for just a piece of duck and waffle. I think there's so many other dishes to try here and hopefully they'll be better. I'll be sure to come back soon to try the rest of the menu!",

    "text": "My sister had a bad day, so I took her here after work to cheer her up. Our reservation was for 6pm and she arrived on time. I arrived at 6.15pm, a little out of breath only to find a queue for the lift at Heron Tower that stretched round the block. It was full of women in very high heels, dresses and elaborate hair dos. My leggings and boots shrank a little in shame... I headed to the front of the queue to talk to the two doormen and explain that not only was I late for my reservation, but that my sister was already upstairs at the table. They let me in swiftly, and suddenly the high heels and hair dos were jealous of me. I had been up in the particular lift before - it's glass and stuck on to the side of the building. It offers a fantastic view of the city and it's pretty quick - climbing 38 floors in a few seconds. The high heels that I was in the lift with screamed as we ascended swiftly but my boots just relaxed nonchalantly, enjoying the vista. The lift stopped at 38 and the heels were hesitant. \"This is the floor for SushiSamba, but I am going up to Duck and Waffle on 40\" I explained. The heels were impressed - they had not been there before and I obviously had. My boots felt vindicated. I followed the long passageway round to the D&W bar. I was pounced on by a woman wanting to know what I was doing there. I think it was supposed to be helpful and welcoming, but perhaps they shouldn't have picked someone who had obviously had Eastern European military interrogation training. I finally made it through a lot of staff to our table - and I have to say, I was impressed. If you don't LOVE height, don't go to this restaurant. If the lift doesn't kill you, then the floor to ceiling glass windows that you sit right next to will finish you off. The view up Bishopsgate and over Spitalfield's Market was AMAZING. As we got there so early, we watched the sun go down during the evening and the twinkly lights start to show up over London. By the time we left at around 9.30pm, it was a stunning night-time view. We turned to the menu and ordered a few things to share. \u00a0We had what was basically the best garlic bread I have ever tasted - hot, very garlicky with a gorgeous hint of rosemary. I would swear that the bread had been made less than 20 minutes before we ate it. We had the half dozen oysters - a mixture that were all delicious. We also tried the baked beetroot that was so sweet and tender, complimented by a goats curd that was just sharp enough to cut through the sweetness. Followed by the aubergine - I was less keen on this, although my sister loved it. It had a charred taste to it that I don't love, although the naan and the yoghurt that came with it were delicious. Then came the duck and waffle to share. I really wish that we had gone for one each - it was sublime. Why does a duck leg, a fried egg, a waffle and some maple syrup work so well together? I can't tell you - perhaps it's the combination of salt and sweet, the textures of the doughy waffle, crisp duck and runny egg. I'm not sure, but it was absolutely out of this world. What did we wash all this down with, I hear you ask... well, I happen to love viognier, and I spoke to the sommelier about his viognier offerings. He kindly pointed me to a reasonably priced bottle from Australia...but I was in the mood for decadence and asked if he had anything from Condrieu. His eyes lit up, he lost 15 years, and confessed that he did have some, and that it was his favourite. I saw the price tag, but decided to go for it anyway. It was heaven. It was really really delicious - fruity but not sweet, complex and dry but not harsh. It was a bouquet in a glass and way too easy to drink! The service was fantastic. There was no sense of being hurried or that they wanted to turn the table over. Everyone was exceptionally warm, helpful and welcoming. We stayed for three hours and were treated very well. The only thing I would urge them to change is that they only have two ladies loos, which means a queue every time you want to go. Moving swiftly from loos to dessert... we ordered the pistachio & dark chocolate macaroon sandwich (mainly because it came with 'drunken cherries' which may have been my favourite dessert item I have ever eaten!) and the vanilla baked alaska, because the Great British Bake Off had just featured Baked Alaskas. They were both delicious - I think I preferred the baked alaska as a dish, but have been spoilt by the cherry version that they serve at the Ivy. Having finished our way-too-easy-to-drink viognier, we had the dessert wine that was recommended for each dish - which meant that going down in the lifts was interesting as we were quite squiffy! Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant for a special occasion or a time when someone needs cheering up. It worked a treat for my sister and we both loved the experience.",

It's different and is highly recommended. I placed my order and will say, their special did not disappoint. The duck was right on point and the waffle was tasting very fresh. The added egg on top was a nice unexpected addition to the meal. Eat the three together and your tastebuds are left with magical bliss. As far as the venue, the restaurant's location gives a wonderful view of London. But let's be honest, after my first bite into my meal, all I cared about was a second serving.",

    "text": "\"You're wearing sandals and it's night time.\" - Bouncer behind the velvet rope.This is how the story starts, but it does get better!A and I were both taken aback. I had made reservations online about a month ago and this was how we were greeted after landing in London that morning & doing a full day of sightseeing and waiting on buses to arrive here at midnight. Suddenly my sparkly gold leather Mephistos felt totally lame. We were starving and we weren't going to get in! We had to pull the honeymoon card. The bouncer called the manager upstairs. After what seemed like forever they said because it was our honeymoon, it was OK, but never again. Kinda harsh, but at least we were in!Our window table wasn't ready so we waited at the bar super subconscious about my sandals. Then I noticed girls wearing dirty $50 converse & I was totally offended. But! Moving on...At our bar table, we met this pair of awesome guys that turns out were originally from California. We talked all about our honeymoon and A's love of UK rock & punk and they ended up getting us a couple of glasses of champagne to celebrate. This pretty much made everything better. I had also indulged in a green juice with kale juice, agave, lemon, soda (Verde) and A got a JD&C (Gentleman Jack whiskey, Aperol, cacao, salted cola reduction, cider vinegar) that was poured out of a flask when served. Both were quite delish and made semi in front of us at the island bar in the middle of the room.We were led to our window table. It was a nice view. The server was friendly and to the point. We already knew what we wanted. The duck & waffle, spicy ox cheek doughnut, BBQ-spiced crispy pig ears, and the foie gras creme brulee. First up was the BBQ-spiced crispy pig ears. Served in a brown paper bag with a wax duck seal. They were warm, crispy, and slightly sweet from the BBQ flavor. We polished it off.Next was the foie gras creme brulee. It was topped with chunks of lobster and served with brioche toast points. Tap tap tap to crack the top and smeared that foie gras creaminess all over the buttery brioche. The lobster was perfectly tender with some give.Then the spicy ox cheek doughnut. Think of the best fluffy doughnut you've ever had filled with a melt in your mouth savory ox cheek mixture inside. So f-ing good.Lastly was the duck & waffle. Perfect crisp skin and melty duck meat on top of a waffle with mustard maple syrup and an over easy duck egg. It was pretty entertaining seeing the place slowly fill with clubbers/drunkies that really should've just gone home. This was definitely one of our best honeymoon meals even though it was the first night. Though the sandal thing definitely made the whole thing awkward.",

My husband and I ordered the crispy polenta and dates to start. They are very small so you'll need to order 2 of each if you plan to share as it only comes as a single piece portion. Still- it was very good. To share with our mains we ordered the rosemary & garlic bread- which was amazing and so fresh and also the heritage tomatoes which had a great flavour.

They shouldn't call it All Day if it isn't actually available all day. The food was good, nothing too innovative; brother ordered the ox cheek benedict and I got the duck & waffle.

    "text": "Made a special trip to Duck & Waffle after an event, since it was my friends birthday and she always wanted to go there. \u00a0 Who am I to say no, I was hungry, it was a 24 hours restaurant and it was supposed to be a big deal!We tried to call a few times to make a reservation but no one picked up. \u00a0My friend said it's likely we wouldn't be seated if we went down there as it's so popular, so of course we went anyway to try are luck.The bouncer that greeted us promptly asked for photographic ID which I didn't have. \u00a0 I had to do a bit of persuading for him to let me in without it. \u00a0It worked! \u00a0But he told us there were no tables available unless we waited an hour. \u00a0We said we would wait in the bar, but when I got up there I spoke to the hostess to see if we could get a table. \u00a0I also slipped in that it was my friend's birthday, but I really didn't need to as they had a few empty tables anyway. \u00a0 Enough so that we could change our allocated table to one with amazing views of night time London, next to the floor to ceiling windows.Being in the early hours, we were given the Late Night menu. \u00a0I'm not exactly a huge waffle fan so wasn't that enthusiastic looking at the savoury options, they just didn't appeal to me. \u00a0However when I saw they had a waffle dessert called 'English Cherries', including cherry & yoghurt ice cream and white chocolate crumble, it had my name written all over it!Our waiter was very friendly, polite and patient while he took our orders. \u00a0My friend ordered 'Bananas Br\u00fbl\u00e9e Belgium Waffle'. \u00a0When they arrived they both looked wonderful (mine had pretty little purple flowers, awww) and they tasted as good as they looked. \u00a0The ice cream was really impressively good, I could have eaten that on its own. \u00a0It tasted sweet (but not sickly) and fresh which complimented the slightly sour taste of the cherries and fresh whipped cream. \u00a0The dish size was generous, \u00a0came with this moorish sweet red berry sauce and was sprinkled with tiny meringue pieces. The waffle was very light and flavoursome. \u00a0It was all delicious and I was scrapping my spoon across the plate when I finished, trying to retrieve the last bits of tasty morsels. \u00a0I can't remember the last time I did that in a restaurant. \u00a0My friend liked her banana dish too but said it came with a tad too much chocolate sauce.The restaurant was kind enough to give my friend a glass of wine on the house, and after we finished our desserts presented her with a plate that said 'Happy Birthday' written in chocolate \u00a0sauce, with some tiny squares of chocolate brownies. \u00a0It was decorated with flowers and a tiny lit candle. \u00a0So pretty and unexpected. \u00a0My friend loved it. \u00a0A great end to her Birthday.Needles to say, the food was delicious, staff (apart from the bouncer) were super helpful, going beyond to make our experience a great one and to top it off the view looking across night time London was awesome.",

    "text": "Conveniently located round the corner from the Liverpool St tube stop on the 40th floor of the Heron Tower is Duck and Waffle. Once you exit the elevator, it's a bit confusing on where to go but just follow the hallway around. You end up at the bar which has gorgeous views of the skyline. I made our reservation about a week in advance and could only get a lunch time of 215pm or dinner of 915pm on a Saturday. We opted for a late lunch and as a result we were starving and ready to feast! We were a bit early so we waited in the bar area. No one came to serve us until about 15 minutes later which was a bit irritating. The service from beginning to end left something to be desired. Oddly though, once we ordered the food came out fast and at a nice pace.The food was amazing and innovative! Although we loved everything we tried and want to come back again to try their other dishes, the highlights were the doughnut and the duck and waffle. The doughnut \u00a0was as big as a baseball and \u00a0covered in a spicy sweet dusting. Inside was some very juicy and tender oxtail and the combination was mouth watering.

There were two dishes that stole the show for me - the duck egg en cocotte, and the banana brulee waffle.Prices to me were very reasonable as well, considering the breathtaking view and comfortable seating.The only criticism would be the loud music, but guess can't complain on a Saturday night !",

Smoked salmon royale on the 40th floor is the best way to start the morning. And it goes without saying that the service was exactly what you would expect from a top end London restaurant.",

We got drinks and I ordered the artichoke cocktail. It wasn't exactly my taste so our waiter had a surprise drink prepared for me. It was spicy and had half of a passion fruit floating on top!We ordered some bread, the tuna small plate, oxtail donut, fois gras cr\u00e8me brulee and of course the duck and waffle. The tuna small plate wasn't as exciting as I had hoped as it was small and I'm sure you could get good quality like that at Sushi Samba downstairs. The stand outs were the oxtail donut and fois gras cr\u00e8me brulee. The duck and waffle was also perfectly prepared, but it wasn't especially new or innovative. Just good food executed perfectly.Had a great night and highly recommend for the views. Its a plus that the food is also fantastic!",

It's best to go during the wee hours, as it's much less crowded and the late night menu is amazing. You probably won't need a reservation if you do this, unless you're going in large parties. I honestly found the duck confit a little too dry, but the combination of flavors with waffle, the fried duck egg and the syrup was great! The banana and Nutella \u00a0waffles were good too, but nothing extraordinary. The fried BBQ pigs ears were great, for a very affordable price of \u00a35. One dish I wouldn't quite recommend is the foie gras and lobster creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e as it was far too rich and pungent for my liking. Overall the food was pretty damn amazing, and the 360 degree view of London from this restaurant is the cherry on top of the sundae!",

    "text": "A little bummed that I only thought D&W was OK. Things just weren't working in my favor... first of all, it was a crappy rainy day (thanks a lot, London) so the view was basically non-existent & all I saw out the windows was fog. Secondly, the only good thing out of 8 dishes we ordered was the Duck & Waffle. I mean, thankfully that tasted good, because if it didn't I would seriously be pushing them towards a name change.Getting a reservation was challenging. You need one unless you like eating after 11PM at night (which you could since this place is open 24/7). The only time I could get was 3:30PM in the afternoon, an awkward time to eat but since reservations were so hard to come by I took it. So 3:30PM, took the speedy fast lift to the 40th floor of the Heron Tower, got out and walked through awkward corridor to D&W. Walked through a very nicely decorated bar to the restaurant on the other side. We were seated and given menus and decided on the following:-BBQ Spiced Crispy Pig Ears - A little weird. Never had pig ears before, but if I had to describe it, it was like eating really hard chips (or crisps for the non-Americans). Some were even hairy.-Cherry Tomato & Goat Cheese Bread - Freshly baked right to the table. Even burned my tongue a little bit, but overall pretty good. Nothing spectacular about it though.-Jerusalem Artichoke Tortellini - My friend loved this, but I thought it lacked flavor. Comes with 4 of these bad boys.-Pollock Meatballs - Essentially, breaded fish balls. This was alright.-Charred Sprouting Broccoli - Greens are always good, but I thought it could've used a touch more caesar dressing. -Duck & Waffle - Now we're talking. Duck, good. Waffle, good. Egg on top, amazing. Maple syrup with mustard, OH. EM. GEE. Best dish of the entire meal. I just wish there was more of it. Like, there's hardly any duck meat in this thing since there's the bone in the way... -Deep-Fried Mars Bar - My friend had his heart set on this. Since I didn't want to have a heart attack, I settled for a bite. Good stuff.-Rhubarb & Custard Rice Pudding - I wish this had more pizazz to it, but it just wasn't there. It wasn't very sweet, which isn't a bad thing, but when you order dessert you kinda want it sweet, right? So, to conclude my review... nice venue, great view (if the skies are clear), decent food but sadly, nothing really top notch, food orgasm amazing. Yeah, I'm sad about it, and if I'm wrong and you want me to change my mind & try it again, I'll gladly do it... as long as the meal is on you. :)",

    "text": "I hate to sound cliched, but at the very tippity top of my \"Most Instagrammable Brunch\" list is this fine establishment, Duck & Waffle - both literally, and figuratively. The ascent to the top of Heron Tower is an experience in itself - my husband described it perfectly when he said it was as if London \"opened up\" like a pop-up book. The brunch at Duck & Waffle is particularly enjoyable - not only for the views and superb food - but also because it doesn't hurt the paycheck too much. Nope, you can get granola and pastries for under \u00a310, which means that it's not as fancy as everyone assumes it is.The signature dish, duck and waffle, does not disappoint: I'm a fan of the mustard and syrup, which works well with the savory flavors of the duck (which was perfectly tender, by the way, and not too dry) and the soft, sweet pillow of waffle upon which it was served. As an American, I HAD to try the fried PBJ (that's peanut butter and jelly, to all you American food luddites), which also didn't disappoint. The spiced ox-cheek doughnut was a joy though: it tasted like a char siu bun mash-up with a sugared donut. Why didn't anyone think of this sooner??New life goal? To make the most of its 24 hour promise ... the perfect way to handle jet lag.Tip: although all the views are worth the visit, try for a window seat - particularly if you're dining as a couple. Memorable and awe-inspiring.",

    "text": "Great place!! Polite and attentive service, great food (we had pig ears, octopus, rabbit, tartare, 2 duck and waffle, different kinds of bread) and I was really happy I could get asahi here!! I've never had it in a non Japanese restaurant! The view is obviously spectacular and it's worth a visit even just for that. The dessert I got (mushrooms on toast) was a bit weird, I loved the porcini ganache but I'm not quite sure about actual mushrooms on an almond cake... 4 stars because of that and the music- way too loud, seems to be in a club. I prefer quieter spaces for supper, we had to scream to hear each other.",

Anyways, we made a booking for dinner on a weekday. The place has a nice vibe. Very chill but definitely dressy chic. \u00a0Service was good. We ordered several dishes to share. \u00a0Had the duck and waffle, aged bone in rib eye, Dorset crab, and yellow fin tuna. The food was just ok. The highlight really is the view and the vibe.",

I walked up asking for a table for 5 and was told there would be a 40 minute wait. The girl behind me was let in right away with their party. A female in our party decided she would ask again and we were then let right in. I could understand if this was a club, and having guys wait longer than girls, but we were just trying to eat dinner. Half of the tables were also empty. Not sure why this would ever happen.",

It was fine because the atmosphere is quiet enough for you to enjoy. With the big windows to have what must be the best view in London also helps.I am of course when's for the duck and waffle which the waiter knew right away. What was really crazy to me was how quickly it arrived. They must know that a lot of people are going to order that dish and have them nearly ready always. I guess it's not really something that needs a huge prep though. I also had a bloody Mary with my breakfast but that was not very interesting and very pricey.If you want to have a great breakfast with an amazing view and fun dishes then this is your place.",

If you go to London and don't go on the Eye, this place \u00a0is worth going to. I had just eaten lunch and the hostess informed me that there were no more lunch reservations. I was dressed for walking around the city, not posh drinks, but she begrudgingly admitted me into the elevator. I soared 40 stories up to the bar. I ordered a gin and tonic. Yes, the gin was Blue Sapphire, but 11 pounds? I don't pay eleven dollars for a gin and tonic at home. Anyway, my mission was accomplished, so I would recommend going here.",
