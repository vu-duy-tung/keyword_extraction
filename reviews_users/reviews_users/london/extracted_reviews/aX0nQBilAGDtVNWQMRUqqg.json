We went for my husbands 50th birthday meal with his family - none of them are veggie, although we are long-time veggies. We were a bit wary about trying a place sight-unseen (we live in Cumbria, chose Gate because it's near sister-in-law) but were delighted with our meal. Tempting choices at every course, and when the food arrived we were all immensely impressed - perfect combinations of flavours, beautifully seasoned and presented. Every course was excellent, and the wine list was very good too - we sampled severel different bottles, all very enjoyable. The staff were friendly and helpful, nothing was too much trouble. Very highly recommended.",

However, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, and the delicious nature of vittles without meat. It never ceases to amaze me how many nice restaurants are available in Hammersmith - you just have to know where to look. This is a very good example of one tucked away in a not very nice location, but drawing a great deal of trade through its fantastic reputation. If you find yourself in Hammersmith, with the wind blowing in your hair and a plate of vegetables in front of you, do not worry, for you are already dead and are in vegetarian alyseum.",

    "text": "As a vegetarian in London, how is it that I haven't been to the Gate before?Oh yeah, because it's kind of spendy and in the unfortunately out-of-the-way location of Hammersmith.That being said, it's really close to both Hammersmith Tube station and the bus station, so there's really no excuse not to visit due to its location. \u00a0Nor is it an excuse not to visit due to its cost, really. With starters at around \u00a36 and mains around \u00a314, while the Gate might not be a place that you'd pop around for as a suitable replacement for your Tuesday-night Chinese takeaway, it's still not out of the question as a destination dining establishment to enjoy a modern two-(or three-)course meal with a date or some good friends.The location is definitely hidden, through a tree-shrouded gate (erm, perhaps hence the name) leading to a church. \u00a0And, yes, you have to go into the church, but you walk up the stairs into the open high-ceilinged space benefitting from a magnificently large sky light. \u00a0The location, the space, the atmosphere - all fab.The food, well, it was fab to a point. On my visit with others, three starters, four mains and two desserts were ordered. \u00a0Of the two starters, the deep-fried courgette flower stuffed with goat's cheese was the only one that truly sang. No offence to the warm new potato salad or the samosas, they just weren't anything particularly innovative or even inspiring. \u00a0I ate my main, the rotolo (some sort of butternut squash and goat's cheese mixture rolled up in delicious potato slices and topped with crispy fried onion), in near silence, so absorbed was I with the tasty party going on in my mouth. \u00a0The two vegan curries at the table looked good but tasted like what I can make in my own kitchen. And the consensus about the risotto at the table was that it was too runny and merely all right. \u00a0As for the desserts, the sticky toffee pudding was, well, pretty sticky-toffee-pudding-y, and therefore delicious, but the coconut and cardamom rice pudding, despite sounding like it was going to be mind-blowing, came out as a lump of rather dry rice that tasted infused with, well, coconut and cardamom. \u00a0It didn't have the consistency of rice pudding, and I thought it would have better complemented a curry main meal than it did my post-dinner stomach digestive juices, jilted as they were by this pathetic attempt at a vegan dessert. I mean, it wasn't even noticeably sweet! Dessert, my foot. (I'm still offended by that sad excuse of a dessert, in case you can't tell.)In short: while the food had its lows, it had some highs too, and the restaurant's vibe made up for the disappointing moments of the meal itself.",

Once you arrive you may find yourself eating in either the courtyard or the attic overlooking it. Either way, you sure as Hell don't feel like your in Hammersmith any more, Toto. You'll have to book ahead as every table is usually full of very smug looking people who have found the place.

The broth evoked autumn forays with a meaty taste that only vegetarians seem to be able to create. The wild rocket and roasted hazelnut dominated the delicately flavoured chanterelles, but the crunchy kale was a perfect accompaniment to the girolles, ceps, pied de mouton and trompettes-des-morts. The meal was beautifully concluded with a sweetly-marinaded snow fungus and vanilla ice-cream, spoilt slightly by the underipe pears. If you want to try, the Gate is a vegetarian restaurant hidden away near central Hammersmith in what looks like a private house. The words 'Temple Lodge' over the garden doorway entrance suggest some kind of vegetarian secret society, by invitation only. The black-and-white painting covering the far restaurant wall, like an oversized Rorschach blot, gives a sensation that your subconscious is being re-tuned to vegetarianism.Exclusive, yes, and well worth the visit for a special occasion.",

On my last night in London, we decided to try this place out since it was close by and had vegan food (I'm vegan). What a pleasant surprise to find out that we made an excellent choice! My friend is a hard core meat and potatoes person and he woofed down his meal. I can't even remember what I got but it involved mushrooms with polenta maybe? I remember he got the schnitzel because he absolutely lost his shit over it. We also got the truffle polenta fries and I'm not sure why they aren't serving these in hip restaurants in the US, but what the holy moly those fries were so good I practically wet myself. Then for dessert, we got the apple and fig crumble and some sort of berry pastry with vegan ice cream. The first was not amazing. I could have done without the figs. The second was so tasty. Overall, this was a great last dinner in London and can't wait to go back on my next visit!",

    "text": "Pictures and more here hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026 Hammersmith in West London is completely out of my culinary comfort zone. Apart from the budget-breaking River Cafe I am not aware of any decent restaurants in this area and River Cafe is certainly too posh for a quick pre-theatre bite. When researching for a restaurant close to the Lyric Hammersmith,I stumbled upon this review of The Gate on Time Out. A vegetarian restaurant that gets 5 out of 5 stars? Intriguing. Even though I am certainly NOT a vegetarian,I do very much enjoy pure vegetable dishes if they are well done. Our attempts to visit The Gate were hindered by the fact we couldn't find it. Even though we had the exact address we kept running up and down Queen Caroline Street which almost ended up in a relationship crisis. Maybe The Gate would consider putting a sign up,that people can actually see? I am sure this would help in getting customers. Anyway,we did find it in the end and I was glad that we did not give up,or break up for that matter. As far as non-Asian vegetarian restaurants go,The Gate is as good as it gets. You will certainly be disappointed if you expect oddly dressed hippies wearing birkenstocks,you will search in vain for the obligatory falafel on the menu and no,the waitresses don't have dreadlocks. There is a tree painted onto the wall though. I loved the bright room with the high ceiling and large windows. It could however do with a little refurbishment. Overall the place looks a bit run down,which was apparent when we arrived and it was still light,and less obvious during the course of the evening. And have I mentioned that a big sign in front would be a really good idea? I loved both of our the starters. The sweet potato and pomegranate salad (5.75) is certainly very good for you. The tangy pomegranate and the sweet potatoes were beautifully complemented by the fresh green leaves and lentils. The sauce contained small pieces of goat's cheese,mint and tahini and this is certainly a dish I could eat every day should I attempt a vegetarian diet in the near future. Less healthy but nonetheless delicious was the Wild Mushroom Gallet (7.50). It is the time of the year to eat wild mushrooms,particularly if they are that impeccably prepared. The light puff pastry was generously topped by aromatic sauteed wild mushrooms flavoured with thyme and onions. The sweet onion jam it was served with offered a beautiful contrast. The mains were not that cheap considering that there is no expensive meat or fish involved.The dishes are prepared with the freshest ingredients and with a lot of attention to detail and as you don't miss the meat at all,this seems fair enough. The Thali (12.50) was thoroughly enjoyable. A light and flavoursome vegetable curry with aubergine and cauliflower came with fluffy pita bread and nicely cooked basmati rice. Delicious were the two different coriander raijtas one sweet,the other one herby. The least convincing of all dishes was the Aubergine Teriyaki (13.75). It was bland and could have done with some sauce. It actually didn't taste of teriyaki very much. The aubergine was prepared almost like meat,which was lovely and with a bit more seasoning this dish would have certainly hit the mark. We had a chat with the owner,who told us that he had this restaurant for over 20 years. He appears to do something right it was packed with diners when we had to rush off to our show,unfortunately missing out on the desserts. I would not travel through town to eat at the Gate (as long as I don't become a vegetarian at least),I am very glad though to know now of a reasonably priced and high quality restaurant close to one of my favourite theatres in London.",

So it comes as the highest praise to The Gate that I love this vegetarian restaurant and have been back multiple times and even brought friends along here.The restaurant is located just down from the Hammersmith Apollo, down a quiet street. In fact, from the outside, it doesn't even look like a restaurant as it's located on the grounds of a church. Follow the stairs up to a minimally decorated dining room and you're in the hands of expert cooks. Not expert vegetarian cooks, expert cooks.I've read somewhere that the best vegetarian food is where the cooks don't try to recreate meat dishes with vegetables. Instead, the food which comes out of the kitchen is full of flair, packed with flavour and lets the ingredients stand on their own 2 feet instead of trying to be a poor imitation of meat. I think most items on the menu are fantastic but in the past, I've really enjoyed aubergine schnitzel, truffled risotto cake and pineapple & chilli crumble. I cook a lot and I am amazed at some of the inventiveness that the chefs display with vegetables.Diplodoci and tyrannosauri of the world, arise together and head for The Gate!

I took two vegetarian friends of mine there so as to introduce them to some international veg food.This was one of the rare occasions when i have headed so far west just to eat. Gate was a bit difficult to find ... given the extensive roadworks near Hammersmith Apollo and its location on the first floor of a church building.But once inside, it is quite enjoyable. The dining area has a huge window and skylight with good views to the outside. The menu has a good breadth but is not extensive. The six dishes in the main course section of the menu included two Italian, two Mexican, one Indian and one Japanese. There are Turkish dishes among the starters. So one can enjoy a variety of cuisines at the Gate, but the choice is rather limited.We had the halloumi kibi as starter. It was very good ... the taste was comparable to the best of paneer tikka that i have had.For the main course, two of us had the gnocchi and one tried the Indian thali. The gnocchi was cheesy ... as its supposed to be ... and flavourful (is that a word ?). But the quantity was somewhat limited. The smell emanating from the thali (consisting fo rice, aubergines, cauliflower and lentils) was great, but my friend who was having it wasn't too impressed. Again ... it seemed as if the amount of food wasn't sufficient.However the desserts were brilliant ... both the ice-cream (this contained egg) and the lemon and meringue tart. This was the highlight of the meal.The Gate wasn't very good value for money ... nobody likes it when he/she leaves hungry after paying \u00a325 for a meal (with a drink each).It was a different lunch experience for a meat-lover like me ... but for obvious reasons, i wouldn't be a regular here. But i would recommend it for someone with a different taste.",

    "text": "We had really high expectations of The Gate. The location was a little hard to find considering you don't expect it to be located in what seems to be the upstairs level of a church. We ordered a few drinks and relaxed. When we went it was early in dinner service and hardly anyone was there apart from a questionable couple and their very unhappy baby. My boyfriend ordered the pasta of the day and I ordered a dish I wish I could remember but I hated it so much...that should show you that it wasn't worth ordering. The only thing we really loved was the couscous balls with feta - it was the only shining star of our meal.We will be back to The Gate because we feel maybe we ordered the wrong things in trying to be more adventurous. We're both willing go back because these excellent reviews don't lie. But ask for recommendations - your server's suggestions could be key. We really wanted to try dessert (like the Eton Mess) but had to rush out to meet friends for drinks and were running late. They also sell a cook book which would make a great gift for a vegetarian cook in your family or friends circle. Pricey, but you could pick it up on Amazon for far less!",

You would never know you were seconds from the Hammersmith flyover in that garden, it is so lovely and peaceful. The service was great, very attentive, although we were the last lunch sitting so there weren't many other customers. As it was my birthday we had champagne, which was brought out in a great silver standalone ice bucket.The menu changes, but what I had was wonderful, a stuffed, deep fried courgette flower with goat's cheese and sweet potato. Even though it was deep friend it wasn't greasy, just deliciously light and crispy. Main course was an aubergine teriyaki noodle stir fry, which was great. It;s not cheap, but for a very nice restaurant in lovely surroundings, it's not too expensive either. The garden, the great service and the high quality of the food make the price worth it.",

    "text": "How to describe the Gate? I can sum it up in two words hidden gem. I can thank the poor weather over the bank holiday and Groupon for guiding me here. I am a die hard meat eater but my fianc\u00e9 is a Vegitarian. I thought it would be nice for her to be able to go out and order anything on the menu she wants. I usually think the food in Vegitarian restaurants is ok but I tend to miss my meat. So we arrived at the gate which is hidden away in the courtyard of a church. I almost thought we were in the wrong place. The Resturant was bright and open ( I now know it was an old artist studio) . The decor was crisp and clean. We were attended to by very pleasant staff who were more than willing to help us on our choices. The prices are a little high but not over the top. The food was amazing. I was almost tempted to lick the plate. The presentation of the dishes was wonderful, the taste combinations were mouthwatering and the portion sizes were filling. I am very surprised to be giving a Vegitarian Resturant \u00a05 stars but I can't fault it. I will be back to try more of the dishes.",

    "text": "Marvellous. Really, really marvellous.The first thing to say is that this super hidden place in Hammersmith was recommended by Yee Gan O, and if you've seen the number of reviews he has written, he knows a thing or two about judging restaurants. (You can pay me at the next UYE Yee Gan).We decided to try out this veggie-haven last night and I was intrigued at its unique entrance. Arrows and signs lead you all the way from the quite street through the at-this-time-of-year-empty outside dining area and up to the lofty dining room with a very natural (though far from hippy) feel.We ordered ginger spritzers which were very subtle in flavour and refreshing as well as seemingly homemade. Delicious. I then had the sushi, which was possibly the freshest tasting maki I've ever had in London.I decided against the korma for my main as I'm not a huge fan of that dish usually, but I had a taste of it when my fine lady chose it instead. I regretted my decision immediately. It was a blow that was cushioned by my equally tasty rotolo (your guess is as good as mine, though it really just means 'tastes awesome and looks funky').With a soft, creamy, yummy lemon tart to round things off, I left feeling about as satisfied as I ever have after a meal. Perfectly full but not feeling bloated, every dish and every course was prepared meticulously and I can't tell you how great it was to go somewhere with so many options, all of which I could eat.It's a real foodie's place, The Gate, and though it's a little more pricey than a lot of places I eat, it was worth every penny. I'll definitely be back, but probably not too soon, because it wouldn't be good for me to get used to eating food that should really only be reserved for the most special of occasions.",

    "text": "This little gem is located above some sort of church or church related entity just a block or two south of the Hammersmith station. Of all the veg restaurants in London, I would say this one is the most upscale and presentation focused, but by no means is it daunting or pretentious. There is a good buzz in the air here by 7:30 on the weekends, so if you don't have a reservation, you better come a bit before 7:00. Also, for those who hate to see wasted food, a nice little touch is that they bring by a community bread basket which you can choose from. That's a plus because I hate to see half eaten bread baskets go to waste at table after table.The menu rotates, so I won't go into the specifics of each dish, but I will tell you that there are two types of vegetarian meals: the ones where vegetables masquerade as some familiar childhood meat dish, and those where the road not taken, is, and the chef puts together some combos that you haven't ever dreamed of. I like both types, but the latter always steal my stomach away. The appetizers here are unbelievable. Pomegranate & sweet potato salad with feta cheese, lentils and spring onion is tasty, but the leek & trompette tart and courgette flower are the best. Am I the only person who thinks regular potatoes should just retire and let sweet potatoes run with it?The mains are delicious as well, and I'm throwing a shout out to the cous-cous crusted aubergine. If it is still there when you go, it is well worth a try. At this place it is hard to go wrong. I have yet to have something I don't like.If I have to give a few knocks, I can. First it is a little pricey, but honestly I expect that when my food is so nicely dressed up and I get snappy service. More importantly, dessert. I know that we all want to be fancy and exotic, but when there is one item on the dessert menu that has chocolate in it and it is chocolate-prune something or other... Well, no one is perfect, and that is why this is easily one of my top two veggie places in London!",

As a vegan, I've grown accustomed to not being able to order dessert. When I saw they offered plum streudel with lemon sorbet made on the premises, I was in.

I also like their Thai green curry and the wild mushroom risotto cake. I have yet to be disapointed by their food. I usually drink their carrot, ginger, beetroot & celery juice which is freshly made on premise. My only reservation about this place is the fact that \"they take themselves\" a little seriously and service is a little distant and cold. I would dare say \"snobbish\". I would not bring my kids there as I have the impression that we would be \"persona non grata\". The restaurant is not that easy to find as it is tucked away but it is well worth finding.",

We ordered a Mezze starter for 2, and shared it between 3 of us. This was a great way to sample all the starters. Particularly good: the 3 onion tart; the couscous and feta fritters and the beetroot and jerusalem artichoke salad. For a main course, I had delicious beetroot pasta, with kale, sage butter and lentils - wonderful flavours. \u00a0My fellow diners both chose the cauliflower korma, which smelled amazing - really fragrant with almonds and coconut.An excellent venue for lunch - veggie or not - and relatively quiet when we were there on a Wednesday.",

I had the deep fried courgette flower stuffed with goat's cheese that everyone here seems to love but I more tolerated it than anything else. It was okay and even though it was beautifully created and served, the flavours just didn't seem to taste very special to me. I also had the mushroom risotto cake because I love mushrooms and I love risotto, but I just could not love this dish either. It was beautiful but the sauce was so creamy it made me feel a bit off, and the flavour didn't seem to penetrate to the risotto cake itself, which just tasted of plain old rice. Even the mushrooms were not really great. For me, the best vegetables are the ones where you really bring out the flavour of the vegetable itself. This fancy style of cooking where you disguise the flavour of everything with rich sauces and other things just didn't work for me. I'm tempted to go back and try the polenta chips because they sounded good, or the pasta of the day because I love pasta, but it is rather pricy so I don't know if I will.I didn't have any trouble finding it though; I think the sign they have put up outside makes it fairly clear. The courtyard with the church is a charming entry and the restaurant itself is cute if empty when I went at late lunchtime.",

    "text": "I've wanted to visit The Gate for a while now and finally got the chance to check it out for lunch today. I reserved a table online and mentioned in the comments my intolerance to gluten and onions. When I arrived, the waitress (who was really wonderful) came over and talked me through the menu and had even written down a list of dishes they could serve me. Unfortunately the chefs love onion and it was in almost everything but I did have a fair few options which was great. She also said if I gave 48 hours notice dishes could possibly be prepared onion free if there was something specific I wanted. YAY!The food itself was excellent. I had the japanese rolls and sweet potato fries and the other two I was dining with had butternut squash soup - both said it was delicious! The atmosphere was wonderful and the service spot on as well. We couldn't resist the desserts either and between us had a chocolate and lavender tart (absolutely delicious with just a subtle hint of the lavender flavour), a summer pudding (also absolutely delicious) and the pineapple, pear and chilli crumble which was really good though hard to avoid those chilli pieces if you're not a big chilli fan! I'll certainly be going back to The Gate and would recommend it to all, even if you're not usually a vegetarian restaurant type of person!",

I should've bought the cookbook! They don't ship to the US and i have not been able to find a vegetarian restaurant to match the powerful flavors that these dishes have. :(I had the abergine schnitzel \u00a0, while my friend had the risotto. Both were fantastic! It truly makes me sad that I can't get this here in the states. If you're ever in London, even if you're not a vegetarian, make a stop here and have a meal for me!",

I had the saffron ravioli which was not tasty. It was too hard and the sweet flavour of the beetroot was overbearing. My friend had the butternut rotolo which was good. But I would not say that it was worth the price.As for dessert we felt like ice cream and the rosewater flavour was awful! It tasted like bitter medicine with a horrible aftertaste. The apple crumble flavour was nice but the pistachio was not great.They do have fresh juices which is a plus definitely!! Overall I would not go again to the restaurant and I do wish it had lived up to my expectations but I guess you don't know unless you try!",

I took along one steadfast meat eater and by the end, he was converted too. Beautifully decorated, chilled and happy with a delicious and vast menu - The Gate is a rare vegetarian treat. A restaurant so good the fact that it only serves meat free food shouldn't put anyone off. You get what you pay for, so it's best saved as a pay day treat. Personally I prefer a lunch time here as it's not quite got the \"date\" vibe, but more dinner with friends.",

And so happy to see the prices weren't that insane. \u00a0As a group of four, we all starting nibbling off each others meals as we really couldn't help ourselves. Price came to 150 with a bottle of wine, 4 starters, 2 sides, 4 mains and 4 desserts! Special mention to the vegetarian tacos as well as the aubergine schnitzel. yum yum. The restaurant decor and ambiance was a lovely surprise; spacious with high beams and a modern comfortable space.Issues - we kept returning the bottles brought out as they were advertised as year 2011 but the ones that were brought out were 2012.Highly recommended N.",

It was nice to finally have genuine food that was made and served by folks who cared about what they put out.For starters, there were other options like Leek & Trompette Tart or Orange & Pear Salad, but decided to go with the Warm Noodle Salad, an asian dish that was good but not sure I would order again.My main was the Wild Mushroom Risotto Cake which was quite good. I loved the creamy sauce, and the parmesan went quite well with everything.To round everything off, I ordered the vanilla cheesecake - it was absolutely devine!Service was attentive and thoughtful - when I had ordered a red to go with my main dish, not only did the waiter bring me the full glass of red I had requested, he also included a 1/2 glass of white to go with my noodle dish. He explained that the white was a better choice for the starter.Vegan or gluten intolerant? No worries, they have you covered here.This place is really worth a visit.",

It's located between the college court and the concert hall on a street where students reside. It's located right next to a church or something so you'll be thinking, ''Uh, I did not come to confess my sins on gluttony today.'' :) Then you go up the stairs and think, ''Man, what a hidden gem!'' It's so cute and romantic, good for those college students looking to take that special someone out.*Wink Wink Everything we ordered was perfecto!Fresh Juice-Blend of Carrots, Ginger, and Apple. Yum. Corgette flower-shaped like a chicken wing, it had all the right flavors and spices. Usually, I don't foods that try to look like meat, but this was fun to eat. It is similar to a samosa. Wild Mushroom Rotola-Not much to say, I'm crazy about 'shrooms, one of my favorite dishes. Aubergine Teriyaki-Not your typical teriyaki, sweet and sour flavor, which is why I like it! The crispy eggplant along with the noodles make for a tongue drooling texture.Pasta of the Day-Gluten Free pasta with spinach and parmesan on top. For gluten free, this pasta was really soft. You wouldn't be able to tell the difference. This was quite simple, but tasty. Dessert-Rhubarb, Pear, & Ginger Crumble-Vegetables in dessert??? Yes, please! This was crumbly heaven! Whoever can get vegetable servings into every course of the meal is a winner in my book. Amen to that!",

    "text": "So for reasons I cannot disclose, I am getting very into vegetarian food these days. My irrational mind decrees substituting tofu for chicken tones my abdominals towards greater definition, steering clear of red meat saves an animal life somewhere, somehow. So after an intensive work out session last night, a friend and I arrived a full hour late for this dinner reservation. After a frantic pant up the stairs, they agreed to serve us as we took a nanosecond to decide upon the halloumi kibi. Think chargrilled halloumi in a tikka marinade, served on a skewer with red onions, peppers, courgettes, a chickpea salsa and schoog. 5/5, top notch and went some distance to satisfying my rampant appetite for food and other less quotable things! After some light banter with the lovely manager, we moved on to mains. Truffled risotto cake, oyster and chestnut mushrooms served on a risotto cake with creamy cep (more commonly known as porcini) sauce on a bed of rocket and parmesan. Now actually it was a little crisp in places, which I adored but was perhaps unintentional. Meanwhile, the tree motif on the back wall panged my friend with bursts of nostalgia, I'll be feeling nostalgia anticipating my next welcome return. A happy sanctuary in W6, leaving a sweet taste in my mouth.",
