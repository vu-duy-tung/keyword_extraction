    "text": "I don't understand why they sell their milk in non-resealable pouches; but it's damn good milk, so I deal with it (hint: I got a vintage milk jug to consolidate pouches, that strikes the fancy of many a brunch/post dinner coffee guest). My other favorite of Daylesford is the hot English mustard. This will be one of those things I'll have friends ship to me, if we ever move back to the US. It really is that good! An extremely small amount goes a long way, so it took me about half-a-year to get through a jar. As for pretty much everything else, I could take it or leave it. Sifting through the veg, I often find hints of rotten spots in things like garlic. The fruit often looks underripe. I'm all for the organic, less-than-perfect fruit and veg, but I still want it to be quality. If farmers at markets can make it work, I don't think it's too much to ask for Daylesford to keep up, too. I've only eaten in breakfast, and it was very basic--eggs, yogurt, granola, etc. I realized everything we ordered, I could have made at home in a matter of minutes. It sorta turns me off lunch and dinner. For me Daylesford boils down to the milk and the mustard. I'll leave the rest, thanks.",

I was waiting in here for about 45 minutes for a friend to show up so I browsed quite a bit. Organics aren't really my big thing so I'm not too fussed about it just because it's organic. That being said, this place had some really cool items that I'll be going back to buy.For example, few places I know sell fresh rabbit and quail, two meats which I enjoy but rarely experience cooking myself. The fresh veggies looked fantastic and heaps better than what I usually resign myself to at Sainsbury's or Tesco.The coffee bar is also well stocked with sweet treats, savoury pies and soups, and a barista who seems to know his stuff despite his relative youth. The coffee was rich and fruity with a hint of nuttiness just after the flavour peak. It was interesting and jumpstarted my hungover brain in no time at all.The one issue I had with the store was the location of the register which is at the back of the food section. Basically, I ordered my coffee, walked to the back to pay, then walked back to get it. Just seemed a bit odd.",

I love brunch, because you can always order eggs or a hamburger, two impossibly great options. I ordered the hamburger and it was amazingly fresh and hot and delicious and it came with STREAKY BACON! And cute little jars of organic ketchup and mustard to apply to my burger plus a little green salad on the side so I didn't feel like a huge pig. Two of my dining companions ordered the eggs benny which also looked incredibly scrummy and the fourth ordered the bread basket which came with tasty looking jams. AND our table had a lovely little green garden down the middle, which we curiously wondered how they kept neat (tiny lawn mower?) and all in all it was just a great spot. HOWEVER, if you have any issues being surrounded by gorgeous children dressed better than you are, this is not the spot for you. Despite the fact I went as part of a four girl sex and the city style brunch, we were surrounded by families. If you have an aversion to little ones or just a really bad hangover, this may not be your idea of fun.",

I went with a friend on a Wednesday afternoon and there were seats outside but I noticed when we are leaving that there was quite a wait for seats at that point. I guess it's because we got there around noon. Get the fresh juices here! They are really refreshing - I had the carrot/apple/ginger one. \u00a0The salads were very fresh and crisp and had that earthy organic-y taste (ok maybe I'm making that up) but it didn't taste like supermarket bought veggies. I had ordered the choice of 3 salads for about 10 pounds - 1 had roasted squash, coriander, and goat cheese, another had wild rice, pine nuts, and rocket, and the last one.. well I don't remember but I cleaned my plate so I can assure you it was good. \u00a0My friend ordered the quiche with a side of the wild rice salad as well. \u00a0She said her bacon, leek and something quiche was rich, buttery and flaky (she also inhaled it pretty fast) - so that sounds like a pretty solid quiche. We also had the carrot cake and espresso. \u00a0Both were superb. \u00a0The cake was very moist and not too sweet with just enough carrot chunks so you might think for a sec... hey there's carrot in here, it's healthy! \u00a0Anyways, the cake was really good and the espresso was decent as well - it had a chocolate-y aroma with fruity accents. \u00a0Service was good - courteous and attentive, but not in your face. Additionally this place as well as other outdoor restaurants (yes 202 I'm talking about you--) on Westbourne grove are ideal for pretty people watching and not so pretty but very well dressed people watching. Oh yeah and lots of bugaboos and lunching mommies. \u00a0Enjoy!",

    "text": "We came on a weekend at about mid-day. There was a wait for tables which was fine, we don't mind waiting but it was clear that they were understaffed and I hope that was the case because if that's how they always work it is a seriously inefficient way to manage the crowd of people waiting to be seated. The hostess had to keep running off to clear the tables and whilst she was away new groups of people would come, not see that there was anyone there to seat them and seat themselves. Then she would come back, see that someone had sat themselves and she would have to go tell them that there was a wait. She was annoyed (and tying her hardest not to show it), they were annoyed and this happened over and over again. Anyway, once we got sat, we had incredibly friendly service and the food was so delightful, it had a sort of energy about it. The only problem was that we ate it so fast because it was so good and then were just sat there contemplating on whether we would reorder and eat it all over again. We were sat next to the cheese counter and while were waiting for our food, we sampled some cheese and chutney. We couldn't resits buying the butternut squash chutney. It was SOOOO good! My only other complaint (and this has nothing to do with the restaurant) is that there were some SERIOUS snobs there and it was rather annoying to have to sit right next to people who complain about everything and brag about how much money they spend. We would LOVE to go back but will be careful to choose a less busy day and hopefully sit where we can have our own conversation uninterrupted by the sound of pretension.",

The in-house produce is of course accompanied by specialty goods made elsewhere, but it's not Whole Foods. \u00a0As much as possible is sourced from local producers and homemade (either on-site or out in the countryside).",

I also had to ask for water about 3 times.the server could not explain me how was the eggs done neither which plate was the one my neighbour was having. So we other a scramble egg in a toast, the portion was so so and tasteless (we wonder how can a scramble egg go so wrong), it came with ONE small piece of bread.in the end we left the place very unhappy and the paid 24, something for two eggs, a tea and a green juice.",

I have vague memories that the food was excellent, the service was efficient, and the decor and ambiance really nice and upscale.",

We went for lunch and got seated immediately. Our waitress was only serving the two of us and somehow managed to cause confusion at every turn. She asked for our orders, then asked us to repeated them twice and left without writing them down.Five minutes later food and drinks that we hadn't ordered arrived. This was a case of the wrong food at the right table. Waitress hadn't bothered to pay attention the first two times, so she had to send all the food back and take our order again. Eventually the manager had to come over, clear up the mess and take our order for a fourth time. Annoying and unprofessional, but won't stop me from going back.",

So those of you shy of going in because the organic label puts you off or you think there may be a wee bit too many sprouts on your plate, don't be, this is seriously good food -for every palette.

I like it, but pressed oranges typically give out more sugar where I come from \u00a0I guess!Pancakes absolutely excellent but the blackcurrant jam was very sour. no additives or sugar of course but even with that it was surprising.French chocolatine (chocolate croissant) was a total disgrace though. Really dry, and I'm french, it was a bit disappointing. Cold and hard doesn't suit a French pastry :)But really nice for the ambiance and quality of ingredients.",

I selected three of the salads from the salad selection, they were all great. I especially loved the carrot, beetroot slaw with an asian ginger soy dressing. It was delicious and I could have definitely eaten a whole bowl of that one alone. The salad was a good sized portion and next time I would pass on the bread basket, it was decent but nothing memorable. I definitely plan on going back.",

We went on Yelp and initially wanted to go to Granger & Co, but after seeing the long line, we headed for Daylesford Organic. I am thrilled we did because the food was delicious, healthy, and just what we wanted. We had a 20 minute wait, during which time we perused the menu, sampled some cheese and beetroot cured salmon, and poked around the shop.We decided to share the: B Renewed Smoothie; Natural Yogurt Bowl; Avocado on Toast; and Super Greens, Orchard, Daylesford Caesar salad trio. The smoothie was so good! It was basically an acai bowl in liquid form, yum yum yum. A bit pricey considering it was only 250ml, but I hadn't had acai in a while so it was worth it. I love Avocado Toast (I know: basic alert!) and this one was no exception. The egg was perfectly poached and the avocado majorly yum. Similar to with the smoothie, portions were a bit small for price, but everything here is organic and really fresh. Plus, I guess I shouldn't be comparing it to what I get in the U.S. The salad trio was lovely. The Orchard salad was so flavorful and fresh, and the the kale just the right amount of crunchy. The Caesar salad was surprisingly good and the egg really fresh. The Super Greens was decent, but I really just wanted more of the Orchard. The yogurt was solid too. Perfect portions of everything featuring delicious crunchy granola and a nice light, tart yogurt.Despite my earlier comment about portions, the boo and I were both super full at the end of the meal (guess we did order a lot of food). The service was great and our food came out reasonably quickly. Would definitely come back for both the cute shop and some more delicious brunch.",

Be sure to shop about for nosh and specialty food and home items (think organic dean and deluca) while you wait for your brunch table.  When this review started I gave them 5 stars. By the end of the review it dropped to a 4. We waited about 40 min for our breakfast; poached eggs, scrambled eggs and 2 vegetable sides. Although the server did come by once to say the kitchen was a bit backed up. Really disappointing as the food was just \" good\". \u00a0We really did enjoy the setting. The baked food we bought for takeaway were honestly the best we had in London. Tried an earl Grey fruit cake. So tasty and moist with perfect bits of fruit. Only 1.49 quid! Same low price for an amazing raisin scone. Would love to have some in ny! Hope to try it again.",

The bill came later and turns out I was right. Other than that I had the eggs Benedict which was really good. Eggs were poached perfectly. But the little side of greens was sad. The wait wasn't too long but at least it was fun killing time in the store part and seeing all the goodies they sell.",

I know this is Notting Hill but it doesn't justify to charge \u00a33 for the double espresso my friend had....\u00a33?? Seriously?? What's in it??...I don't see how a place can justify a double espresso at this price (It's not even that expensive at Duck & Waffle and you get at least a nice view while drink your more expensive than average coffee)Even if the setting is nice, I am for sure won't go back as this is too much overpriced...I am happy to pay more sometimes but I need to see why, and I couldn't see it here.",

You can see people waiting to be seated most of the times. \u00a0However, take into consideration that they have a flow so you can find a table after a short wait. On my last visit I had scrambled eggs with sourdough bread what came with butter and jam for brunch! I am not a yoghurt person and scrambled eggs were the only option for me. They have a really good healthy and simple menu all with organic products. \u00a0It is well situated in Notting Hill and brightly decorated. When you enter in organic fruits and vegs are welcoming along with daily baked breads. They have sections; butcher, creamery, grocer, fishmonger, dairy, wine. One floor down you can find homeware section and etc. Overall it is a very cool cafe but definitely not my favourite. I prefer to visit just for tea and pain au chocolate.",

Ok, I have to admit we were really hungry and we're waiting for ages in front of Granger & Co when we decided to go somewhere else...The first place we saw was this organic shop and restaurant, which seemed great.But beware... All the food is really expensive. I had the vegetarian quiche of the day with 2 choices of salad and the portion was so tiny ! I don't get it : quiche is one of the cheapest meal to cook...It's sad, because the food itself was tasty.My friend had the eggs and toast and were very disappointed with the small portion as well. The only good thing for them was the chocolate cake they had for dessert, and for me it was the prune and apple juice, which was pretty original.I wouldn't recommend this place. Yes, Notting Hill is expensive, but it doesn't mean I have to get out of a place and be still starving.",

After attempting to sift through the few legitimate weekday shopping options on Portobello Road, we decided to grab some lunch. Before we could reach our destination, the rain picked up and we ducked into Daylesford, primarily seeking shelter, but ultimately discovering a culinary feast! We kept it light with the soup of the day (tomato) and shared several salads. The best was the green bean salad - I forget the name now - with a mustard vinaigrette and some semi-dried tomatoes and garlic. I tried to replicate this at home soon after, but couldn't do it justice. All the food tasted so fresh and was not too heavy. There's a shop up front where you can buy produce from the farm and a boutique downstairs with some unique gift items and kitchen/housewares. All-in-all a 5-star stop!",
