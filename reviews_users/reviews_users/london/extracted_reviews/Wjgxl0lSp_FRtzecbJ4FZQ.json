However, the big booth with the soft seating at the back is VERY comfortable and excellent to relax in with friends if you manage to get this! It's also good during the warmer months as they have plenty of outdoor tables and seats. They have an upstairs restaurant area which serves VERY good food. We were very impressed.

Turns out, this is Victoria so none of those criteria are particularly appropriate BUT the Queen's Arms did deliver in that we got a table, everything we asked for on the menu was available and the service was good. So all in a solid option for the area.Generally diners go upstairs I think, which would lend it more of a restaurant feel. In our case, the upstairs was closed so we had to eat downstairs. This did make it feel like we were intruding on the boisterous Saturday night drinkers' territory somewhat, and meant it was very loud but we had a nice time anyway. Sticky toffee pudding - believe the hype!",

The staff were really friendly, and the upstairs dining room was really nice on a cool Friday evening in the London summer.The menu is nice gastropub fare. While many of the standard steaks and fish and chips were present, they have definitely done them up a bit to make them more than meagre pub grub. They had Sipsmith's Summer Cup available, which was a delightful pre-dinner cocktail.We enjoyed a salad, the fish and chips, and a few drinks. It's definitely a step up from standard pub fare, but not so much as to make it inaccessible for an impromptu meal.",

My companions and I enjoyed the cocktail sausages and chips, both of which were delicious. There's a nice wine list and service was friendly and efficient. It's also a nice ambience. We were there on a Tuesday night beginning around 7 PM, and it was mostly the after-work drinks crowd. I would definitely return for drinks if I needed to meet someone near Victoria Station.Now, the bad - we decided to continue on to the dining room for dinner. Granted, this was around 9 PM, and the dining room appeared to be winding down. I ordered a shrimp pasta dish, which was completely flavorless and had about three pieces of shrimp in it. On the plus side, my companions said their steaks were satisfactory, although not great.The server was courteous enough, but completely disappeared other than to take our order, deliver our meal, and (eventually) deliver the check. The slow service turned the dining experience into a two-plus hour event. So two stars for the restaurant. I won't do that again.",

Not sure if it's more a Gastropub (was decked out nicely) but skin on cooked chips, fresh tartar, garden peas (I prefer mushy though) and a cod that was as fresh and crispy as you like. So tasty.

The meat platter, humus and pita, chicken wings and fish goujons all went down a treat. I think the avocado salad was the best part.

I was drew in by the reviews of the vegetarian roast. I thought could I be reading this right!? Do they really have a vegetarian roast!? Indeed they did! Vegetarian roast accompanied by; carrots, green beans, and Yorkshire pudding! It was hearty and delicious. If you're a meat eater not to worry. They offer a few roast options with various meats. They have several beers on tap. I'd suggest one of the ciders. There is a dining area separate from the bar. The dining room was closed during our visit due to a private event. We did not mind sitting/eating in the bar. The ambience was quaint and warm. The service was friendly and attentive. Thank you Queen if Arms for not leaving the vegetarians out of your Sunday roast special!",

They were both really good! My friends raved over the asparagus and pea soup. And the fish n'chips were a large, fresh side of seafood. This pub also had the BEST bowl of chips!
