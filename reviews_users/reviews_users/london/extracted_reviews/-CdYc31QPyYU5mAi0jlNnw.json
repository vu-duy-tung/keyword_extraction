The service is also really good \u00a0but the location and the venue are a bit of a challenge. It feels quite soulless (think a hotel dining restaurant - it reminded me of Lost in Translation) and the bathrooms are 2 floors below where you eat and only accessible by a lift that is very slow and means a round trip takes about 15 minutes. If you like Japanese food and are prepared to pay premium (and are not fussed about the environment) then give it a go \u00a0otherwise save some pennies/pounds and go to Busaba Eathai - it still offers great value Thai (not Japanese, I know, so i'm not comparing like with like)",

    "text": "I think this is an amazing place. Slim escalator up to the dining room, the lift down to the swish basement loos, the option of shoes-off dining. You wouldn't expect a restaurant to have escalators inside, but they do at Sake No Hana Nice and fun! The ground floor is now a slinky lounge area where punters can sip Japanese-inspired cocktails or take shots of 'incredible' sake & graze on small plates of king crab & rice cracker croquettes or teriyaki chicken wings. It's a must to try the sake. The first-floor also boasts a revamped layout with a new sushi counter overlooking St James's. In response to criticism about arcane food & sky-high bills, chef Daisuke Hayashi has devised a simplified menu peppered with accessible dishes such as seared tuna & green tea soba salad, Ib\u00e9rico pork & beef rib-eye shabu-shabu (for sharing) or robata-grilled quail with sancho pepper. Service is impeccable and polished and the menu, courtesy of Chef Daisuke Hayashi, is several pages long but features lots of traditional dishes like 'Shabu Shabu' as well as the more common Robata grill selections and a huge selection of assorted Tempuras. We chose an assortment of dishes including seared razor clams with wasabi and soya, rib-beef tataki, braised aubergine with duck, seared tuna and green tea soba salad, Iberico pork and ribeye beef Shabu Shabu and a selection of sushi including the crunchy Alaskan snow crab maki rolls. Prepare to spend $$$$ though !!!",

My friend and I got two fruity drinks at about \u00a34 a pop (note: they are FILLED to the brim with crushed ice, so really it's about a shot glass worth of elixir you're consuming... so sip-slowly).We had the mixed seaweed salad, which was A-OK, the three-way tofu, which was perfect to share, and with bold flavours against the delicacy of the silk tofu, the sake no hana roll, which i will absolutely recommend, though the rolls, in general, seem to have plenty girth, so plan to savour one pick in a couple of bites, the ponzu butter baked crab, which at \u00a325 a pop was succulent but ended up being too much to savour on top of the salmon avocado roll (beautifully executed), the rice dish which i do not remember what it was called, but it was p l e n t y to share. Couldn't let the dessert pocket empty, so ordered the hazlenut ganache pyramid, and the chocolate wafer fingers, which are such a sight, and a delicate taste. I think these were both at around \u00a37 or \u00a38 a pop. The chocolate wafer fingers taste better after they've warmed up a bit, otherwise if you try to sink your spoon/fork in, you'll end up breaking them in many shattered pieces.Our waitress was really good, and she suggested we remove a couple of items from our original order, as she was afraid it would be too much for us to consume... boy, was she right!the restaurant itself is very sleek, you can have a decent conversation, and not feel cramped. beautiful space filled with people that do appreciate it!Look forward to going back!",

Located in an unassuming building this restaurant is fitted with beautiful woods and almost-traditional Japanese seating (some seating areas allow you to sit on pillows). Walk upstairs to a beautiful dinning room or choose the sushi bar on the ground level. At night the light scheme reflects off the wood laced ceiling and creates a warm yet modern ambiance. The restrooms are quite cool too.The fish is of highest quality and the menu allows for some exploration. Miso & tea is boiling hot (just as it should be) but wasabi was on the light side. Good service and friendly staff. I suggest watching the sushi bar at least once... the chef hierarchy is fully in force here and watching the bar is a cultural experience in of itself.",

    "text": "Sake No Hana located in London (near the Ritz) was on offer on Toptable for 50% off the standard menu (excluding Sushi). Based on their nice (but expensive) cocktail list and the good selection of interesting food on the main menu off we went. Now, these days I'm lucky to be in the position that an expensive meal can be done once a month without much fuss and Sake No Hana would have been without the 50% easily \u00a3140 - \u00a3150 for two with only one drink each. So well worth pointing out that this is very expensive... Anyway, we arrived a little early for our table and were pleased we could take a seat anyway. The restaurant was pretty full at this time but only got busier through the evening. It is really pretty inside and well decorated in a simple but elegant way. Our waiter informed us that five or six dishes for the two of us was the right amount to order. We went for; i) Sesame Auberginesii) Tofu done three waysiii) Iron Pot black cod riceiv) Sukiyaki Rib of Beef (cooked at the table)v) Kinome Alaskan crab with ponzu butter Total full price cost \u00a390 which when you include cocktails at \u00a39.5 each or wine starting from around \u00a330 a bottle added up :) Sorry, but the food was not great. The Kinome crab was three small sections of leg, one of which was burnt. The Rib of Beef was good, but the waiters leave the table while it was cooking and it was overdone as they didn't turn the gas off when they came back the first time. The Iron Pot was great, really good fish, good taste and high quality rice, so we loved that. But the two smaller dishes of aubergine and tofu were bland and uninspiring. Overall, with very small portions, and not that great taste, it's a real shame. They should go back to basics before trying to run. Donzoko really beats this place handsdown and is so much more authentic.",

    "text": "Recently I went along to Alan Yau's latest Japanese themed restaurant that also won Time Out's Best Restaurant for Design. It looks impressive, yet I have to say the overall experience disappointed and I'd rather spend the money at more traditional places like Sushi Say. The design Taking over what looks like the first two floors of an office lobby, you enter via automatic round doors guarded by a bouncer into a rather non de script lobby. We almost missed the place with tiny small lettering only visible when you're standing almost right next to it. To your left as you enter, is a less formal sushi bar, with the dining room accessible by a set of two tiny escalators moving up and down. You check in at the tiny desk at the front before a an attendant seats you at the bar while you wait for your table. The tiny escalators, perhaps intentionally designed to induce a claustrophobic sensation, take you to an even tinier corridor. The dining room sits underneath an array of light wooden square frames creating sharp and contrasting options with soft yellow lights casting their glow in the circular dining room. Around the outside perimeter of the building, diners sit at more traditional tables where they need to remove their shoes before seating, with the inside used to host regular tables and chairs. Though impressive looking, I'm really not so sure why they got voted the best design as I've seen better at other places. The service For a place that should have been astonishing with their service, I'm afraid these people are still practicing. I was already put off by being made to wait at the bar when the restaurant was clearly empty, and I'm sure our table clear. Instead we were made to wait at small tables near the bar, until we ordered. We asked for tap water, that they ended up serving in a tiny 200mL glass. I wouldn't have worried so much except that they didn't give us a jug and the attendants only refilled them once throughout the night, despite the sodium rich food leaving you wanting more liquid. I'm sure that had we been paying their \u00a33.75 per bottle of water, or more for wine, they would have been better. When the food arrived, it somehow took two people to serve the samll plates of food each time - one to hold it, the other to put it and present it on the table. The final straw was when it took at least fifteen minutes for them to bring the bill after asking for it specifically and giving up trying to make eye contact with at least one attendant in another fifteen minutes. The food Since they opened, it's obvious that they have listened to the feedback offered by numerous reviewers. Unlike before, the menu is now roughly grouped into different areas like fried, grilled, stewed, appetisers, and the dishes significantly larger than the others marked as for 2 or for 3. Their menu still lacks descriptions so be prepared to be very adventerous, read up before going, or already know a lot of Japanese dishes. Having eaten at many Japanese places, I didn't really know what to expect from a number of them, although I could take some rough guesses. We tried a few new dishes including the sesame aubergine, tempura figs with yuzu salt and the soft pork ribs. Out of them, I'd have to say the ribs were the best that, although not fall of the bone soft, were actually pretty easy to eat even with chopsticks. The meat was sweet with the vegetables served with it providing lots of flavour. The tempura figs provided a sharp contrast to the strongly flavoured citrus infused salt. I can't say that the dishes, as good as they were are worth the money you pay for at this restaurant. Conclusion I get the feeling most people dine here to see and be seen. As much as a unique Japanese experience Yau wanted to create, I'd rather go to a proper Japanese restaurant than return to a place that obviously still has teething problems.",

    "text": "On arrival of the restaurant, I wasn't sure which one was the entrance. On the one side it looks completely dead! I wondered whether it was the right restaurant as there were no signs. Then I saw someone entering the restaurant from the other side and that's where the main entrance is! I felt a little embarassed looking lost on St James' Street on a Sunday evening, staring into the empty restaurant (I believe that is opened for lunch only). Our friend was over an hour late so we were being sat by the bar until the last person appears. They did however asked if we would want to sit by the table to wait but luckily we didn't choose that option as everyone was tucking into good food.Once our friend arrived, all tables were taken so it's completely understandable that our table won't be available immeditately. The host constantly came over to inform us that a table will be available once the diners have finished their desserts. We only had to wait for an extra 30mins! We ordered a good amount of food since we got the 40% discount through Toptable. The food was amazing! The 3 kind sashimi plate is the freshest I've had in London so far. Really enjoyed the Dragon roll, eel avocado and tobiko caviar roll, the Crunchy king crab roll and the Salmon and crab roll with wasabi mayonnaise. They were absolutely delicious! The Chicken Sake as well as the Black Cod in Miso were breath taking! My only disappointment was the Yellow Tail dish. The fish was fried and bland... although the only flavour could taste is how fishy it was. I thought it was me but my friends who also dined with me didn't enjoy that dish. I wouldn't recommend it.The service is a bit slow and was really amazed how busy it was on a Sunday evening. We didn't leave till about 11.30pm and there were still a few occupied tables. Another downside was that I was really looking forward to the white chocolate pistachio mousse but it was sold out! Really gutted! I had a really good experience and unless you have a bit of \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 to treat yourself, you should do so. We never looked at the bill properly and was charged full price. We only noticed it this morning but as we were that satisfied with our food that evening, we were happy to pay \u00a360pp! We had a 4 course meal including services/tips so we think that's really good for this kind of restaurant. I suppose the bill would have came up higher if we all ordered alcohol!",

We arrived on time for our 9pm reservation and were told our table wasn't quite ready but were asked to wait \"5 or 10 minutes.\" at just past 10pm we were finally seated. At 10:30 our server, who was completely lacking experience and a personality, finally arrived and asked if we'd like to order anything. Our drinks arrived just before 11pm, almost TWO HOURS after our reservation. Food arrived sporadically for the next hour. Now, I've eaten sushi regularly for many, many years, and I've had it in cities all around the world. Our sushi was average at best. The Toro sashimi was not as fresh as I would expect, considering we paid 8GBP per piece. The rolls were very average, and the presentation was well below average. We paid our bill at 12:30am and left. Just over 100GBP for the two of us. We had 6 pieces of sashimi, two cut rolls, one hand roll, four cocktails and some still water between the two of us. This place is grossly overhyped in my opinion, and I would not recommend it to anyone who really loves sushi. Again, if you merely want a fancy room, go for it. But Sake No Hana has terrible service, above average prices and average (at best) food. There are plenty of other sushi places in London to try your luck.",

    "text": "Came here when a friend was visiting and toptable had a 50% off food bill. This is the one of the few times I've had Japanese in London (given that I'm really picky with it and most Japanese places here seem to be crap), and I was kind of excited to eat at a reputable Japanese restaurant. I think even if I got to go back with the 50% again, I wouldn't. Let's break it down.The actual place is gorgeous. Reception/coat check is done at the base of an escalator (black marble, chandelier), which brings you up to the dimly lit, minimalistic, wood laiden dining area. \u00a0Staff are all very polite and professional, and you sit on tatami. \u00a0The big wooden tables are beautiful, as is the general feel of the place.The food -- if you come here really craving some quality Japanese food, go somewhere else and save your wallet the pain. Presentation is beautiful, and the menu had a decently wide selection of dishes, but in comparison to the atmosphere and price, the food is mediocre. \u00a0I tried a lot of stuff on the menu -- the sashimi, rolls, beef udon, crab, teriyaki salmon, tempura, etc... and wasn't really impressed with anything. I also tried several of their desserts. I was quite excited about the exotic fruit plate, but the waitress couldn't even tell me what half the stuff on there was, and none of it actually tasted ripe. Sake menu, however, is pretty good, but I'm still not up for paying the set price.For 5 people, our bill came to be about over \u00a340/person, and that's AFTER 50% deduction. Come here if you have money to waste or if you're dying to impress gold digger types with no familiarity with Japanese food. Or you can just pay me a small fee and I'll refer you to good places.",

The menu spans sushi, sashimi, rolls, vegetables and then a few mains (wish I'd tried the black cod, it looked fantastic). We dabbled with a few dishes across everything, but the big plates of sushi looked very good too. Every dish we ordered came individually, served on fresh plates, giving the meal a feeling of intricate ceremony and leaving us savouring every mouthful. The cocktails also went down well, and then passionfruit cheesecake was a nice way to round things off. The only annoying thing - the toilets are about a million miles (and a lift journey) away, and the restaurant was freezing when we were there. Wrap up warm!",

You'll have to take an escalator three floors down. \u00a0The entire experience is a bit dizzying. \u00a0 \u00a0 The food, however, is phenomenal. Small, overpriced dishes of deliciously fresh sushi and sashimi. \u00a0The drinks are also delightful, and go along well with the space.One piece of advice: don't forget to wear nice socks, you'll be required to take off your shoes.",

    "text": "One of the best Japanese restaurants in London in my opinion, a traditional and modern set up. Sake no Hana impresses with its own flair, high ceilings & interesting seating options and with plenty of room. The tatami tables are well set apart and the overall atmosphere was very good. Food at Sake No Hana was excellent, particulary the sesame aubergine, the blue swimmer crab, the black cod rice and avocado sushi roll, and all of the sashimi. We ordered many different dishes and shared everything, dishes arrived as and when they were ready, which meant for a steady flow of delights. This is however not your usual sushi haunt but expect intelligent compositions of taste and presentation. There are excellent cocktails on the menu, although a bit pricey, and even I managed to have 4 during the course of the meal. The waiters were a bit over attentive and I overheard some diners say they feel hurried by the constant attention from the waiters. The one negative is that the restaurant is on the 1st floor and the toilets in the basement, there is a lift but also a constant queue outside it. Overall a lovely experience if you like grazing and have a small crowd of people together.",

    "text": "I ate at Sake No Hana last night, and it was by far the worst dining experience I've had in London (and perhaps ever, but maybe I can think of one or two other disasters that top it...)Where do I begin? \u00a0Well, the best parts of the evening were my anticipation upon arrival, and my relief to exit (knowing I would be able to stop on the way home for an ice cream to begin to make up for Sake No Momo's poor showing).In an attempt to keep it brief:- The waiter was horrendous. \u00a0He was brusk, and acted like he was doing us a favor to take our order, and really did little more than just that.- The edamame was probably my highlight, as it was standard and I like edamame.- All the food that followed was a let down, from the seaweed salad (priced at a meager 11.5 GBP) which tasted like an undertoe, complete with granules of sand contained within to the 4 sushi rolls (each priced at 15+) which were 80% or more just rice.- The ambiance didn't help. \u00a0It feels very big, bright, and industrial. \u00a0Most of the tables were empty, and the rest of the clientele was questionable (older business men and younger less well-dressed women).The bottom line: \u00a0After dinner, my friend and I noticed the manager had been walking around all night, and had stopped at several tables but not ours. \u00a0Neither of us are the type to call over a manager or complain generally, but the night had just been so underwhelming, she flagged him down. \u00a0When we explained that the meal had been disappointing, the service bad, and the food not bad but not really good, the manager responded exactly the way he shouldn't have - defensively and awkwardly. \u00a0I told him the seaweed salad tasted like ocean, and he agreed it was not his speed, but assured me it was a favorite (!?), and after listening to us for a moment, he offered to remove the service and the salad from our bill. \u00a0He offered us a dessert or a drink, which was something I suppose, but at that point, we told him we'd just like the bill so we could leave. \u00a0Nearly 30 minutes later, after flagging the waitstaff down relentlessly, we were brought the bill (still just about 100 even with the discounting) and got the heck out. \u00a0Thank god for the ice cream shop at Bond St on the way home!",

The dessert was was great as well, we each tried one and the best for me was the mochi! some of my friends really like the soya ice cream. I will recommend this to anyone.

You take a funny little escalator up to the top floor where the theme is much the same with a few more anglicized touches. Onto the food - Excellent and daring. A great choice of sushi as well as some more traditional dishes. Probably the best place to eat sushi in SW1. It comes at a price though.",

American diner a bit put out given that the price is higher than what is used to for equivalent fair, even in NYC.Service was passable but without the attention to detail one might expect at equivalently priced pure-Japanese service.Overall, passable and mediocre.(I do love clay pot rice - this is available here - even with black truffles; but it was uninspiring, even with the truffles... more's the pity)",

    "text": "Sake No Hana is part of the growing Hakkasan empire (Yauatcha, Hakkasan, Naamyaa Cafe & HKK and other laces - all created by Alan Yau, also the man behind Wagamama and Busaba Eathai) and Sake No Hana is as many of the other places nice and sleek in its design. There is a small bar by the entrance, looked nice so will visit some time, but we were going to the restaurant and to get there one has to take a small escalator up. There were huge number of staff everywhere and I think 8 or 9 people greeted us before we had walked to our seats. The dining room is really nice, the tables are in light wood, the ceiling is high and we were coming in as the sun was setting so we first got to see it being very light and bright and when the sun set the lighting was adjusted to create a really nice atmosphere.We were having the set 4 course menu with a glass of sparkling for \u00a329 so was a bit hesitant what to expect, especially after going for a similar set meal at Benares a few weeks earlier which was a real disappointment. Here it did start of well though with attentive service and the glass of sparkling was served quickly. One in our group wanted to exchange it for something non-alocholic and that was no problem so good service. The menu as such consisted of a soup (choice of two different), a main (choice of four different), sushi (choice of two different selections) and the dessert of the day. I started of with the white miso soup with mushrooms. It was a delightfully light flavor with plenty of mushrooms so a very good start. It was followed by a chicken sukiyaki that was really good, a good mix of juicy chicken, great sauce, onion, spring onions, mushroom and tofu. I then went for the vegetarian sushi option and it was a huge dish (same went for the regular sushi) so I was getting very stuffed already. Tasted good, a nice spiciness to it as well. The dessert of the day was a raspberry creation filled with chocolate and served with lychee ice cream. I could recognize the style from the desserts at Yauatcha and the it was really great in taste here as well. This was also surprisingly big so we were rather stuffed. Did also try some cocktails, the ones we tried were very good so may actually drop in just for a drink in the future as the location is good and I liked the ambiance of the place.Service was in a sense very good, we had people there the instant we wanted it and there were a few things messed up but they quickly managed to fix things so cannot really fault them. It did however seem like the service was a bit anxious, when something went wrong five people apologized for it and the I think we were asked around 10 times if everything was ok so I think they would benefit from a relaxing a bit more. Still did like the place and would be happy to return both for food and cocktails.",

Overall the food was good, the tasting menu reasonable priced and the service was fantastic. Having to get the lift down to the basement for a trip to the toilet was a bit weird but not odd enough to be too much of a distraction.Food wise could be slightly hit and miss. The miso soup was pretty average (I've never found one that was any more than this to be honest) but the salmon and tuna sushi was fantastic and the wasabi had enough of a kick to make sure you are careful with the quantity. For mains the salmon teriyaki was far superior to the miso chicken (probably the worst thing I tasted) and the dessert was incredibly strange. I went for a sesame panna cotta with mango sorbet. On it's own the panna cotta was not pleasant at all but when you combined everything on the spoon it just worked. It's that kind of dish that makes me want to go back.",

Very good wine and spirits list and really stylish the piece of ice that they serve with liqueurs, I had to take a picture of it as it was really big! (they have a lot of Italian liqueurs from different regions that are almost impossible to find in London)Overall it is not cheap (we paid \u00a350 each), but the food is good, the restaurant is nicely decorated and the service is very good, as in all the sister restaurants.

    "text": "With having eaten great food at sister restaurants HKK and Ayuatcha, I have become a bit of a fan of Alan Yau. Sake No Hana did not disappoint either and there is a great Yelp check-in offer to get you into the mood for food! 29\u00a3 for a four course menu and a glass of sparkling.The restaurant is absolutely beautiful! Decorated in a subtle Japanese style, with light flooding in from the lengthy windows, there is a warm dignity to the place. It is worth visiting just for the ambiance. We arrived just before dusk, so we got to see the space both bathing in daylight and candlelit dark. Someone had really done their job well with thinking of the look of this place.About the food: We happily went for the set offer menu called \"Taste of Sake No Hana\". It sounds a bit like there's not that much food, but boy was I stuffed after all four courses. We had around two/ three options to choose from for every course. Only the dessert was \"un-choosable\" and a surprise, only described as the \"dessert of the day\". We started off with a white Miso soup, with mushrooms. The hot soup was an excellent first course, heating us up after stumbling in from the freezing March weather. And the taste was good too =)! We continued with some nice tender Chicken Sukiyaki with spring onion and mushrooms and my sister, who is mainly a vegetarian (except for eating seafood) tried out the prawn and vegetable tempura. All of us were happy with our dishes. The third dish was a set of Futomaki and Gomoku Inari sushi. The maki-rolls were huge, and who ever complained about there being too much rice (in an earlier Yelp review) had clearly gotten the message trough. There was only a thin belt of rice surrounding the fresh mix of fish and vegetables. The Gomoku Inari sushis were \"cakes\" of rice\" covered with tofu. Boy where they yummy, very full in taste! The Dessert of the day looked familiar, it was a beautiful raspberry-covered chocolate cake. I remember drooling after it at Ayuatchas dessert counter. It came with some fresh lychee ice cream, that did not impress as a companion to the full chocolate notes, but was delicious on its own. It just made me wonder slightly if they had sent all the leftover cakes from Ayuatcha to be served as dessert at this place. It was just a thought, the cake was anyway very good.About the drinks: Our menu came with a nice glass of sparkling to start with. It was an a-ok Prosecco. I am more of a cava girl (and constantly disappointed at the dominance of Prosecco here in the UK), so I was not that impressed. But hey, it was inclusive in the menu, no Finn will turn down alcohol. We also tried a few drinks of the cocktail menu. I had a delicious gin-based drink with ginger juice, grapefruit, vanilla and chili served in a pretty, tall martini glass. It was excellent! Not easy on the chili, but that's how I like it. I could definitely imagine coming to the bar just for a few of these drinks. There was a lot on the menu to choose from.About the service: There was a lot of staff for an early Monday dinner. Perhaps as it was Easter. We received very friendly service from all the staff. The manager (whom I recognised from being a regular at Ayuatcha) came also to check on everything being ok. Our waiter fumbled a bit with the food, but it did not bother us as he apologised and cleaned up quickly. There were even a bit too many apologies during the evening for the small mistake =).",

We were celebrating my husband's birthday and had reserved a table for 10:30 after the show we were going to let out. We picked this place because it was the closest higher-end sushi restaurant near the London Palladium, and has such high reviews on TripAdvisor. We arrived at 10:20 and were ushered into the bar to wait for our table to come available. After enjoying our overly priced drinks (\u00a329 for a cocktail, and 12 year Japanese whiskey) no one had come back to show us to our table. After 30 minutes of waiting my husband checked in with the hostess and was told they were unaware we had arrived and had given away our table. Despite the fact that there were 4 individuals at the desk when we checked in for our booking, and one of them escorted us to the bar herself, and then told the bartender exactly which table number we would be seated at. We were then told it'd be just a bit longer until they could seat us, so we waited another 20 minutes in addition to the initial 30 we had spent at the bar. At 11:10 we still had not been seated so we paid our bar tab and let them know we would be taking our business elsewhere. No apologies, no offers to right the situation. I regret paying our bar tab, we should have just walked out. I will never return to this restaurant. It is grossly overpriced and the service is beyond terrible.",

It's a little on the pricey side, but if you want fantastic sushi in a great \u00a0restaurant in london then you have got to try this place. A little tip, if you need to use the restroom don't wait too long as you must take an elevator to get to the restrooms. The staff were very helpful and they even arranged for a birthday dessert with candles for my girlfriend ( at no extra cost).",

    "text": "London Restaurant Month has come back around again so myself and some friends decided to take advantage. This years venue for us would be Sake No Hana, the little sister of Michelin starred Chinese restaurant, Hakasan. Sake No Hana is modern Japanese cuisine done very, very well.I'd had plenty of \"Japanese\" food in my life; sushi, chicken Katsu etc. I had never been to a proper Japanese restaurant and had high end food. This was my chance. The deal was as follows: 5 courses from a set menu and half a bottle of wine per person. All for the princely sum of \u00a335 (excluding service).As you can see from the menu you pretty much get a choice of vegetables or fish. For my choices I had the maguro tartare to fukiyose, the fish gohan selection and kisetsu tempura moriawase.First off was the best miso soup I had ever had. On the menu it is misoshiro - white miso soup. A great, light starter to get your appetite going. With small strips of inari and seaweed.The next course was 3 small portions; a tuna tartare, fried rice ball and vegetable crisp \"salad\". Much like an amuse bouche, it continued the theme of getting us ready for the main course. The vegetable crisps were lovely; earthy and crunchy. It included carrots and lotus root, which I had never tried before but very much liked. The tuna tartare was fantastic. It was peppery and brilliantly seasoned. The rice balls were a little stodgy but the accompanying sauce was sweet and rich.Next was the sushi course. 6 pieces, 2 each of spicy maguro maki (spicy tuna, tobikio and cucumber), chirashi maki (salmon, white fish and shiitake) and inari maki (fried tofu and caramelised onions). As you can see it was beautifully presented and it wasn't long before they'd all been polished off!The main for me was tempura prawn and vegetables. Crispy and not at all greasy, this was the best tempura I'd ever had. I especially enjoyed the squash which was nice and sweet with that perfect crispy exterior.Both of my friends had the salmon. There's not a lot to say about it other than it was served on a large leaf and cooked absolutely perfectly.Dessert was the same for all of us. A delicate sponge cake soaked in a syrup and served with preparations of peach; raw, sharp peach, raw, soft, sweet peach and peach sorbet. I was a big fan of this. So much so that when one of my friends wasn't keen I ate his too!Sake No Hana is a wonderful, modern restaurant with fantastic food and brilliant attentive staff. My glass, wine or water, never ran dry and they were always on hand to help. In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a restaurant that had such a high customer to staff ratio! It's definitely a dining experience I would recommend even if it's not one that I would probably do again. Nothing against the restaurant at all, more that I like to explore and try new things. If you can visit Sake No Hana on a tasting menu or similar you would be silly not to give it a go! Either that or at least go to their amazing bar!",

There were some courses I enjoyed more than others, but none that I disliked. The menu comes with a cocktail of choice and a fine bottle of champagne. I got mint and cucumber martini like cocktail based on our server's recommendation. It was light and refreshing, not heavy on the mint with a hint of cucumber. My main course was the chicken dinner with egg mustard sauce and truffle rice. The chicken was so tender, didn't need a knife. Other highlights of the meal included tempura shrimp in wasabi cream sauce along with many varieties of sushi. And then there was dessert! Bamboo dessert with white chocolate inside. Break it open. A sweet cream drizzles out and the bamboo itself is edible white chocolate. Wow!!!Unfortunately we didn't have time to linger as we had a plane to catch so we were rushed by the end. And we had been there for 2 hours!!! Service was exceptional so it's not that they were slow. It's that there is so much food to enjoy and savor. I would say plan on a 3 hour amazing experience to truly relax and savor.",

Maybe I'm spoiled by the amazing Japanese food we get in Vancouver. Overall, it was a good dining experience. They were very accommodating of my sister's dietary restrictions (no diary) and their sake list was practically a book (although we opted for wine instead).

So why 3 stars and not zero? \u00a0Mostly because the food was first class, fully deserving of the price point. The service was more in line with what you find in a tourist fry dive around the corner in Victoria. Our problems began at arrival. Sake No Hana is in a strange building, where the dining room is upstairs. So they deploy someone to \"announce\"you on arrival to avoid people milling around upstairs. Fair enough - if the person doing the job was neither arrogant or conceited and instead polite. But, er, not so much. Worse, the person who is supposed to cover the door also does the coat check... which is ridiculous. So you turn up for lunch and get to watch someone overwhelmed talk on the phone to announce someone else's arrival while wasting your time. This is beneath what we expect at this price point.Once in the dining room, the food is of very high quality. One cannot fault the execution, and the menu is broad in option. Ingredient quality is first class. On food alone, this is one of London's best. So lots to like. But... The same crew that man the door also man the tables. And good luck to you, because these guys don't do service. We waited a good while to place our order... which was not complex. Then we waited another 45 minutes for our starters. And then.. another 40 minutes for our mains. During this period, the staff were simply invisible. At \u00a350/head for lunch (or more) this is a joke. Absent service is totally fine in a place operating at a third the price point, but not acceptable at one that is supposed to be a 5 star option. Any of Nobu, Itsu, or Yo Sushi crush these guys on service. I won't be back until the service staff are gone.",

We went here for a late dinner (2130) the night before our flight back home as we tried to stay up late. We ordered several rounds of starters, sushi, mains, and dessert. The staff was always attentive, but never rushing us. We asked many questions, and they always had complete answers. And the food. Fish was fresh. They were out of two things, but I saw this as a good thing at that time of night - they would not serve us the bad stuff. They have several grades of Toro to choose from. I like medium fatty and was glad to see that. Everything was excellent, but the Gindara Tempura Maki and the Hoshuku Whiskey ice cream were the stand outs - both their own creations.",

    "text": "It's been a while since I've been to Sake No Hana, but I went back last weekend to their bar, where they were celebrating the Japanese cherry blossom season by decking out their entire bar with pink cherry blossoms. Quite a sight!There was also a special sakura season menu, with cherry blossoms and cherries featuring in drinks and desserts, as well as a double layer bento box for lunch.If you go, do see if they have a double layer bento box, as it was quite a sight and even tastier to eat! One layer of scrumptious sushi and sashimi, and the other with the two hot courses.Desserts were amazing, although slightly too rich for my tastes but if you like chocolate you would definitely enjoy. Cocktails were well crafted, and service was excellent.The best thing though about Sake No Hana is that while it is just moments away from the hustle and bustle of Piccadilly, it was like an oasis of tranquility, made even more so by the pop-up sakura garden for these few weeks.",

The waiters were friendly and good, but perhaps not 5-star. The sushi was amazing! The black cod very nice. The aubergine and fig dish was good, but not great. The mochi ice cream was super. All in all a good experience. The venue and location are both great.",

    "text": "Sake No Hana has been on my must visit list ever since I saw it on SilverSpoon London's blog at the start of this year. It's a little more out of my price range for a regular dinner but via OpenTable you can get a great 5 course Taste of Sake No Hana menu including glass of prosecco for \u00a329 per person which is great for a special occasion.The first course was, of course, a traditional white miso soup - shiro misohiru which oddly came with no spoon. Instead we started off trying to eat it delicately with chopsticks before giving up and slurping it down. It was much lighter than other miso soups that I'd had before and slightly less salty which was nice.We then had a starter of prawn or vegetable tempura and while the portions were quite small they were cooked to perfection. The batter was deliciously light and crispy instead of soggy and there was a wide range of veggies used including asparagus (my fave!) which makes a nice change from the usual boring offerings at Yo!Sushi of carrot, onion and aubergine.Next was the sushi course, I went for the fishy version while Victoria opted for the vegetarian. So many people think that sushi has to involve raw fish and that's really not true at all. Some of my favourite kinds of sushi are the ones with no meat in it, avocado maki rolls for a start. Anyway, I digress the sushi at Sake no Hana was utter perfection and I didn't want it to end. You could tell that it had been freshly handrolled right before serving.For main there was a choice between salmon hoba teriyaki (Char-grilled salmon on hoba leaf with teriyaki sauce), Yukki Dori Sumiyaki (Char-grilled organic chicken with pickled courgette) or Agedashi tofu toban (Tofu and aubergine in dash broth). I of course chose the salmon and my dining companion went for the chicken. The presentation of these dishes was exceptional and almost too good to eat. Only almost though and what followed was some of the most perfectly cooked fish I have ever had. The little crisps that it came with gave a wonderful texture to the dish and although I was struggling I made sure I ate every last morsel.Finally it was time for dessert and I have to say I was bitterly disappointed. When Lifestyle Lauren went just a few weeks before us the signature dessert was a delicious looking mango pannacotta. For us it was a still beautiful to look at slice of apple tart tatin but if there is one thing I really don't like its hot fruit based desserts. Sorry! The Taste of Sake no Hana menu is really great value for money. The food is of exceptional quality and the atmosphere is lovely too so I really recommend it even despite my dislike of the dessert ;)",

    "text": "The decor and the atmosphere can really distort ones taste buds especially when the dishes are so elegantly presented as well. Sake No Hana was a bit like that. I was left in awe the whole time I was there stunned by the beautiful venue, Green Park prestigious location, the live sushi bar but mostly by the temporarily Sakura pop up bar where the whole of downstairs was decorated artfully with artificial cherry blossoms. For the first day opening of the Sakura bar they even invited two Japanese drummers to play a traditional opening ceremony which was a stunning performance, greatly synchronised playing with great attention to detail. For that alone I would give it 5 star. They also ended generously with the breaking of the sake barrel where everyone present was offered a cup of sake and although very diluted it was very a traditional act and much appreciated.Better were the special cocktails on offered which included the Hanami Bellini Cocktail and Sakuratini cocktail. I did slightly preferred the latter for it's sweeter taste although both had a good depth and lovely notes of flavour.Without this event though I doubt our lunch experience would have been that spectacular. For it's location food pricing was soaring high but sadly the quality of the food did not match it. It seems that more attention was placed on the presentation rather than the cooking and flavours. We decided to start with the special menu offered and went for the special Sakura Crystal Double Layer Bento Box to share. It came with a miso soup starter which was definitely a higher quality than your usual fast food miso soup- more smoother with a nice rounded flavour and not just salty. \u00a0The box also contained seven-spice chicken kuwayaki which was overcooked especially around the edges which meant it lost most of it's tenderness and became dry and dense. The flavour was hardly original bur rather like any yakitori flavouring, I definitely couldn't remember tasting the seven spices in there. \u00a0I much preferred the fresh crunches of the nicely marinated broccoli with sesame dressing. It was paired with deep fried lotus which could have been anything deep fried as you could no longer taste the lotus. The second layer comprised of the sushi which was more successful. I very much enjoyed the quality of the salmon sashimi, fresh, rich and clean cut. \u00a0 As much as I enjoyed the texture of the rolls and the quality of fillings ( salmon avocado, spicy tuna and California rolls, and chu-toro) the rice was not sticky enough and was falling apart. I do expect a much higher quality for the price of \u00a328. Barely filling our stomachs we went for the Taste of Sake No hana set menu and chose the red miso soup to start which came with yam croquettes. These were too soften for my liking and lost all it's yam taste it was barely recognisable. We both preferred the white miso as this one lacked the smoothness and creaminess. Still it was enjoyable and a different miso tasting. For mains we chose the salmon teriyaki which which could have been better if it was cooked slightly less so it was still pink inside. Being cooked slightly more than it had to meant it lost it's buttery texture although still nice as it was. But the problem was there was no originality in this dish either and something I could have ordered at another Japanese restaurant for half the price. I do believe most of what we paid for was the way it was presented, on a hoba leaf above a little charcoal stove. I'm glad on the side we also ordered the sesame fried aubergine and fig which actually was one of the highlight dishes of the meal. This is where creativity sparked in terms of flavour and actually worked. I very much enjoyed the sweetness of the figs against the fried aubergine smothered nicely in a lovely rich, savoury, nutty flavoured sesame paste. It was all nicely balanced nicely with a light salad on top too. Delightful. We finished on desssert. The Matcha pannacotta with kumquat yuzu and pistachio was very zingy and creamy although I felt there was not enough sweetness to balance it. It was one of those dishes that was great to look at but taste didn't match.Luckily we ended on another joy which were the skilfully crafted vanilla macaroons with cherry blossom tea ganache. They were slightly more crunchy on the outside but still falling into a light creamy filling. A very nice finish to the meal. Although it was a very enjoyable meal most of it was due to the surrounding factors of the restaurant itself rather than it's food. We did manage to find some great dishes in there but sadly not enough to recommend or return any time soon on an ordinary day. However we will be more than happy to return yearly for its celebration of the Sakura season just for an insight of the traditional Japanese culture. I would love to see the drum performance again as words cannot describe the energy and care that went into it. A big well done for getting that organised.",
