Granted it doesn't have all the dishes for dimsum but the ones it's got is far better than most of the others I've tried in Chinatown (Don't even get me started on top of the town!)I really suggest going for the chefs specials and the bolo bun with charsiu filling. It's pretty lack lustre compared to HK ones but it'll do the job and i'm pretty sure only they serve it. :) I like the siumai here, it's less fatty pork meat that most other chinese restaurants use. But be careful, it really depends on the day. Service wise, I don't have a problem, the staff have always been well...chinatown average. They're all like that in chinatown, so i don't take it personally. Their mantra really is to, get you in, feed you, then you pay and get out for the next table. Seeing as most don't speak much english anyways, if you speak cantonese/mandarin, it's always a plus. Racist but it works.",

The menu is pretty sparse for a dim sum place but the food is of relatively good quality.Gerrard's offers a menu with pictures for everyone who has never ordered dim sum but sadly does not have a push cart system. You put the number of each dish you want to order onto an order slip and the waiters bring it out for you. Not the most traditional flavors as I feel the dishes have been tweaked slightly for tourists and non-Chinese clientele. But that being said, this is probably one of the places that have dumbed down their dishes the least in Chinatown.For those who are more adventurous, try the hot chicken feet and congee with preserved egg. The place is usually pretty busy during the peak hours so be prepared to wait if you're with a large group, but the service is very efficient and you won't wait terribly long for your food.Best restaurant in the Chinatown for your money!",

The quality is always up to our expectations. The one thing I dislike, hence why I have only given 4*, is due to the fact that when they are full, they try to hurry you.

The bill was the total amount in a manuscript piece of paper. Then, we asked for the detailed receipt and after a long waiting they grudgingly brought it to us. We saw that they charged 12,5% as \"optional tax service\". As we soon learned this tax has nothing of \"optional\" and that was already included in the bill! We didn't want to pay that tip since the service was lousy but the rude maid quickly brought us a cart to proof us that we had to pay 12,5% as tip. We demanded to talk to the manager but she told us the manager was eating. We said the manager had the right for their break; we paid for the total amount but we insisted on talking to someone else in charge.The maid told us \"disgusting\", she left and never came back. After 15 more minutes we grew tired of waiting so we left.This is a tourist trap to be avoided by everyone visiting London's Chinatown. The charge for the tax service is now customary in the U.K. but one can refuse to pay it when the service is lousy as this one. Well, except if you're going to Gerrard's Corner!",

Mostly fried things, and the ribs were a little too sweet for my liking ( as was the sweet and sour pork) but still good. Spring rolls were crisp without a trace of grease and the sesame shrimp on toast was very good, too. Aromatic duck was the perfect second course, although, again-- more deep fried food.The black bean shrimp were slightly spicy with lots if crunchy peppers and the fried rice seemed to look sticky and glue -like but it turned out to be among some if the best fried rice I've had. Vegetable portion was small, but I love those little straw mushrooms and the way their texture contrasts with the water chestnut and crunchy snow peas.Overall, it was a great dinner.

It felt like I was talking to a poorly designed robot when speaking with anyone who worked there.Anyways, we went here because it seemed like it had the best prices in the area. 7 pound sweet and sour chicken was about the lowest on the strip; and with 2 pound rice it seemed like the way to go.Look, I can't really knock the food. It was the most normal Chinese food I've ever eaten. Never have I been less excited but not disappointed in what I was consuming. For that it's an only ok and bland place to go, probably better if you're drunk (like most things).One member of the staff left us a pitcher of water after we asked for our glasses filled. That was nice, I like having a lot of water available to me. The check came out to 20 some odd pounds and we weren't thrilled to have to pay it. The portion size of our chicken was quite small. The rice was well portioned but overall it was not enough food for the price. What's with sesame chicken not existing in England?",

Diners mostly come in for dim sum at lunch time and classic Cantonese dishes for dinner. The wok fried noodle dishes are generally pretty decent and so are the soup based noodle bowls, try to stay away from the BBQ items, however as quality wise are not near as good as other restaurants nearby, such as Four Seasons.",

    "text": "I've eaten here several times and I wonder why I ever did. The quality of the dishes vary enormously depending on how busy it is, from reasonable to positively offensive. The range of dishes are nowhere near as extensive as the other restaurants nearby. Vegetarians should be discouraged from eating here as a friend's Sweet and Sour Tofu had a 2 pieces of chicken in it. Although the prices are quite low, around \u00a330 if you don't order the lobster or oyster dishes, the place leaves a lot to be desired.The service, as indicated on the menu, is not included. So expect muttered indecipherable explanations of dishes, long delays for your food, plates ripped from you before you've even finished, a generally rushed atmosphere where they want you out as soon as possible. They took a chair from our table to put onto another one, without asking, whilst one of our company was in the frankly disgusting toilets. When she returned they shook their heads blankly as she requested another chair. She stood for another 10 mins before they understood the problem. To top it off, on one occasion they brought the rubbish through the floor of the restaruant leaving behind the scent of refuse everywhere.Although all these things have been compounded over 3 or 4 visits. I will pretty much guarantee that at some point when visiting, you will encounter something unsavoury.Please, walk on a little further and visit the many other places in Chinatown where the food and service are miles ahead of this one. I implore you, please do not eat here, for your own sanity.",

    "text": "This was a lovely dim sum place, among my top two in Soho Chinatown. \u00a0My friends and I went for dim sum during the weekend, and there was a little bit of a wait. But, it was well worth it. The dim sum menu is a pretty standard Cantonese spread. We ordered a couple of dishes for a light brunch. Two dishes I typically use to judge a dim sum place are: the rice noodle rolls and the baos (quality of the noodle crepe and the dough, respectively). One of my friends ordered the rice noodle roll with youtiao (\u6cb9\u6761). The noodle crepe was perfectly steam and thin. And, the noodle roll had a sprinkling of toasted sesame seeds which added another layer of fragrance. The char shao bao was flavorful in its stuffing (Chinese BBQ pork) and the exterior was soft and wasn't dry. We ordered a couple other dishes as well such as chicken feet in black bean sauce and duck tongue. Both were great as well in terms of flavor. The food and atmosphere reminds me of dim sum tea houses in Hong Kong with a bustling staff, Cantonese dramas playing on flat screens, and the tables set with white tea cups. So, brownie points for OG-ness. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for dim sum.",

A friend of mine ordered the duck, it looked delicious but the duck was cold and though brown, lacked a crispy skin. Therefore, the fat was gross and congealed. The whole dish just did not taste right because it was pre-cooked done and not heated correctly. \u00a0The flavor of the soups was quite good. The staff seemed to be pushing us to get through orders but was not really helpful with questions. Overall, not a great experience I would not recommend eating here. \u00a0The place is playing off the location in China town but is not a good representation of the nation's food especially for the cost.",

We did the math and including their stated 12% service charge, our bill should have been under 50 dollars. When we insisted on the detailed bill they had us go to the main register and they printed out a bill stating that the total of the receipt with service charge was 49.60 lbs.

    "text": "I found this restaurant pretty good, despite of thw reviews i read.Well, it is expensive but the food i had was tasty.We were a group of 9 from my office, lead by Debbi our chinese colleague. We had this dinner for the mew chinese year and we trusted her in the coiche of what to eat and drink.We had this lovely herbal tea during the entire dinner, because as debbi said \"Chinese people always drinks tea while they are eating\". It is a mix between a green tea and a matcha tea. Very nice.The arrived the startes. Everything was fried: from the prawn ball to the vevetables, spring rolls and meat. The fried was not heavy at all! The secound course was the pancake with duck. I never had duck before. It is nice! Tasty and fun this course as you are the one who create its own pancake with the souces you like.Finally the main courses arrived. Debbi ordered a lot of things: sweet and sour vegetables, lemon chicken, prawn with i don't remember, egg fried rice, singapore noodles and other things i don't remember.The total has been 33\u00a3 each.I vividly suggest this place",

I'm Chinese and from San Francisco, so was not expecting the same level of taste in a tourist spot of London that I would expect to get at home. That said, they have a variety of dishes and compared to what we've had to pay for throughout London, the servings were generous for the price. Moved us through quickly enough, left happy.",

    "text": "Not my first choice to have dim sum here, but everywhere was full with long queues, and they were the only one that had a table for two available without waiting. \u00a0Anyway, it was a chance to try lunch as I have already been here a few times for dinner which was ok, but nothing to shout about.I ordered the usual steamed prawn and meat dumplings (har gow and siu mai), and deep fried octopus cake (which were abnormally too puffy) but the texture was good and springy and tasted good dipped in the sweet vinegar. I noticed that they have a trio of cheung fan with prawn, charsiu and scallops as one dish, so ordered that rather than having to decide which one to choose, why not have all three! \u00a0This dish was a little more expensive and also the sizing was much smaller than I am used to, so not sure if it is that good value after all. \u00a0The rice sheet wrapping should be almost transparent that you can see what is inside the wrap, so this was good. \u00a0We also ordered a bowl of rice noodles soup with mui choy (preserved mustard greens) and shredded duck, but they didn't have the mui choy and substituted it with picked mustard greens. \u00a0Normally, this would serve 3-4 people, but the bowl was the same except the contents was not. \u00a0We struggled to even serve 2, and it was quite bland.Dim sum for me is not dim sum without the steamed deep fried chickens claws in black bean and chili sauce, if done well the the meat is fleshy and soft and melts in your mouth. \u00a0Here, the flesh was not soft enough, but was ok.My companion likes the pan fried turnip paste so we had some of that too. \u00a0Finally, i also liked to finish off with something sweet, like the steamed lai wong bao (steamed custard buns). I love these baos. \u00a0However, did not realise they were not the ones I wanted, until I went to eat one, the filling was in liquid form, and just poured out, and was so sickly sweet and it felt like it was uncooked! \u00a0I have never come across this type of bao, and it was not all that nice, so definitely have to be more wary when ordering again, that I am ordering the right bun! Did not realise that there are different types of lai wong baos, hmm! Instead of the usual green teas, do try the chrysanthemum tea. Light and refreshing.Also, good to note that they do not charge for the take-away box, if you wish to take a doggy bag.",

(On the public footpath, I might add.) As for the food, well seemed to consist mainly of tiny pieces of meet covered in cornfloury goop. \u00a0They want you to eat fast and get out, of course as it is essentially a tourist trap. \u00a0I really wouldn't bother. There are far better options, even nowadays when Chinatown is past its prime.",
