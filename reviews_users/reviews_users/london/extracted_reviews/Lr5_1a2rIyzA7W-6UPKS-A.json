    "text": "I've been stalking 26 Grains on Instagram forever, long before I'd even cemented my plans to move to London. So on my first day out, it was top on my list of spots to try out on the London breakfast scene. After getting ever so slightly lost (I'm new) I found it in a wonderfully remote triangle courtyard-style area in the middle of Neal's Yard in the Seven Dials area. It's tiny with just one large table outside and a few small ones inside. Note that the seats are quite small timber square stools - not the most comfortable seats but not awful. The menu, written on chalkboards both inside and outside, display a range of seasonally changing porridges plus a few cold dishes (this may change in other seasons I'm guessing) like Bircher and a smoothie bowl plus some delicious sounding savoury options. A good range of hot and cold drinks available too, including some trendier sounding options like turmeric hot chocolate and the now common matcha latte.I ordered the Rhubarb & Cardamom porridge with buckwheat and oats on almond milk with stewed rhubarb, tahini Greek yoghurt, cardamom granola, coconut flakes and amaranth (6) plus an Americano and milk on the side (2.5). Ordering and payment is done at the counter simultaneously. Considering their porridge is made fresh (you can see them stirring over the stovetop) it didn't take long to arrive and the coffee came quickly too. Coffee (Workshop Coffee roast) was excellent and exceed my snobby Australian expectations. The porridge was creamy but not heavy and relatively unsweetened with the rhubarb and yoghurt adding tartness balanced by the sweeter granola and coconut. \u00a0It was basically a porridge version of my ideal Bircher muesli with contrasting flavours and textures - granola on porridge is genius. It was a delicious and substantial breakfast and I will be back to try more of the menu! Very cute spot and with Neal's Yard Wi-Fi available, it was the perfect spot to chill out and enjoy the morning although the minimal amount of seating meant that I felt I shouldn't linger too long.",

I've been many times and I just love it!My only 2 little complaints are the lack of seating or the lack of a queueing system. Especially on a Saturday morning at peak time they should take your name when a table becomes available. And also, the lattes although they are delicious they are often not hot enough so it's best to ask for your drink extra hot in my opinion!",

    "text": "After the goop raves I had to check out 26 Grains. Located in the \"off the beaten path\" Neals Yard, this place is a real gem. I went on a weekday so we luckily walk right in to find a spot which was lucky because I would venture to say the indoor seating space could at most accommodate 15 people. This places effortless hits the nail on the head for balancing fresh and healthy with artisan goodness. All of our dishes were wholesome and hearty while being beautifully presented as their own little works of art. I personally had the matcha latte and waffles. I added the tahini Greek yogurt and almond butter to the waffles. The matcha was not overly sweet. And the waffles were spot on. For a further breakdown see below: Location-5Seating- 3, my only issue was that I found the seats small, hard and a tad bit uncomfortable (perhaps they don't want to encourage people hanging along too long due to the shortage of space)Staff- 5, friendly but not overbearing. Also good at recommending things if necessaryFood- 5, simple goodness that doesn't try tooverachieveOverall it's getting a 5 stars from me.",

The matcha flavor was weak, and the oat milk latte part lacked a certain consistency of foam. (I later went and had a perfect matcha latte with oat milk at a nearby cafe by way of comparison. But If you're going to offer matcha, you do need to get it right.) The only other thing is it was kind of loud. The music was good, but a bit high, and some food prep machines were quite loud, if only temporarily. Notwithstanding, I definitely recommend and will return here to try other things on the menu.",

This year, I was so determined to go, and finally made it happen (twice). Maybe I just hyped up the place too much in my head, but I really didn't like this place.Okay, yes, the porridge is BEAUTIFULLY presented, and I love how cute the place is, tucked into a corner of Neal's Yard. I DON'T love how crowded the place is, especially on a Saturday afternoon. The first time I came was a random Wednesday morning and the wait wasn't too bad. Others have mentioned that they take a long time with the porridge; the second time I came, I waited over 30 minutes for them to make my porridge. It just seems that they have a very inefficient system of taking orders and making them. So the first time I came, I got the Nordic pear porridge. Really great texture in the porridge - creamy, smooth, and thick. However, I couldn't get over the spices they used. I think there was tumeric in there? My porridge had a salty taste that really made me dislike the dish. Wanting to give them another chance, I went again that weekend and ordered the apple butter & hazelnut porridge. Again, it was salty, though still maintained a beautiful presentation. I really love porridge and really wanted to love this place, but sadly, this was a miss for me. Maybe my taste buds are just messed up though, or I got a dud out of the batches of porridge, since everyone else seems to like it so much!",

In my most recent trip here, I got the savoury porridge with kale, egg, avocado, sriracha and seriously can't stop thinking about it. Oh Lawd was that good and pair that with their green smoothie - you are winning in life. Biggest downside is that they have somewhat small portions and it took about half an hour to get our food. They do warn you about this ahead of time, but if you are super hungry, this is not your place. The queue goes by really fast, but beware of waiting for your food.",

Both amazing! Wife and I also split the toasted banana bread topped with butter and cocoa nibs [A+].

Like Grom, Alex Hely-Hutchinson helps the masses recover from childhood porridge traumas to rediscover and enjoy the beauty of the grain. The sweet selection is headed by the ever-popular blueberry, bay and cacao porridge. But, I'd urge you to go for the savoury sriracha spiced porridge instead. It's a subtle patchwork of texture, flavoursome and warming for a cool morning and a dish that will be hard to get out of your mind. If you really really hate porridge, there is a selection of breakfast pastries available at the counter. The banana chocolate danish is not bad either",

It had started to rain (it's London, after all) and I was famished. Luckily, I was there when they opened, because a line was already forming and the eager crowds just kept coming. I watched from the counter as the chefs made a steaming bowl of the most delicious porridge I'd ever eaten, accompanied by a pot of perfectly steeped hot tea, all served up by a kind and friendly staff. \u00a0The meal was so soothing and exactly what I needed. I came back again the next day, and probably would have returned every day after if I hadn't run out of vacation days.

Now it's my go-to whenever I visit.(3) With a couple of sweet porridge options, I tried the Nordic Pear with coconut milk oats. It was alright at first but when I was halfway into it, I couldn't continue as it was so thick and slightly bland.

    "text": "From the Covent Garden Underground, it is a nice walk going through the streets to find 26 Grains. The porridge here are delicious, but a tad expensive and might not be filling. Still, any porridge with honey will hit the spot. Most of the bowls are on the sweeter side. The staff are very friendly and offers their views on what you might like based on your taste. If you sit outside, you have a beautiful view of a small and colorful square. The seating area inside the restaurant is tight, but cozy.",

    "text": "Overall: The cutest little brunch spot I found while in London! Delicious porridge, cosy, cute ambience and friendly service. Hoping I can find a place like this in the Bay Area, otherwise I will be back if I visit London again! \u00a0Cuisine: Ordered the Apricot Elderflower Bircher Muesli and Hazelnut & Butter Porridge. Both dishes were full of delicious, well-paired flavors! Would recommend the muesli if you're craving more of a cold, refreshing dish and the Hazelnut & Butter Porridge for a sweet, warm dish. If you're interested in savory, others next to us ordered the Egg and Kale which looked awesome! Ambience: Located through a small, beautiful alleyway. On warm days, the store front opens up to connect to an outside seating area in a little square surrounded by colorful buildings. The seating is very tight and at the outside tables you almost rub shoulders and backs with the people behind and to the side of you. Nonetheless it's part of the charm!Service: Friendly staff! Order at the counter then find yourself a table (or wait for one to open up). Despite the tight quarters, someone will bring you your dishes and when you're finished they will clean up your table once you leave.",

    "text": "We went to this place after noticing the high review on yelp. Neal yard setting was very beautiful. We sat right outside of the shop, enjoying latte and porridge. I liked my hazelnut butter porridge. Half way through our meal, we felt bunch of dust fell from above. We looked up but only saw empty balcony. I went inside the store and told the girl behind the counter about it. She quickly responded \"that wasn't our fault\" multiple times and didn't seem to talk no more. Hmm that reaction was a bit unusual. Wonder how many times this happened before. I was just trying to let them know that maybe directly under the window is not a good seating place. Bewildered, I went back to the table, after trying to save the food unsuccessfully, we left.",
