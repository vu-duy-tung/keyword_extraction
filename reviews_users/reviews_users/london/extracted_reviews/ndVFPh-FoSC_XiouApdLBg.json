    "text": "So, I rocked up here with half of my office for a party a few weeks back. My first impression was somewhat clouded as our taxi was descended on by a man in stilts, who pretended to 'chase' us and pretty much scared the living daylights out of everyone inside. The other costumed entertainers weren't much better, attempting to be funny by abusing people in the queue but actually just coming off as offensive.Once inside, much better! It's a nice venue. Not a huge one, but great for say 250 -300? I have no idea what the maximum capacity is, but any more than that and we would have felt crushed. It's hard to judge the drinks, as a couple of the cocktails were put on especially for the corporate party we were attending. All I can say is that they were awfully strong! However, even with the crowd, the staff coped very well and we weren't waiting for long. Every one of my drinks was served with a smile, even taking my weird fresh lime vs. lime cordial OCD (the latter is too sweet, bleurgh).The bathrooms were an endless source of comedy for me. One, if you can find them straight off without asking, I congratulate you. As I said, it's not a huge place - so this says a lot.Then, you realise that the door leads you into a central 'sink' area, for which there are no taps, just a motion activated waterfall that pours water from a column that drops down from the ceiling. The immediate realisation that people have no idea how to turn on the water at first is slightly distracting from the off.The next hurdle is working out which door was the ladies, and which was gents. Luckily, no one was about to see me cautiously push open the door of the boys' room then sneak back to the other side of the foyer in five inch heels (hardly inconspicuous).Oh, and I saw FOUR girls almost take a fall by slipping on the water that started accumulating on the floor. Central 'sink', and dryers on the outside walls = water on the floor. Be careful.Though as I said, I wasn't too charmed by the circus performers' attempts at interaction outside, while they were performing - it was very cool. There were Marie-Antoinette inspired outfits, girls eating fire, burlesque dancers, boys with hula hoops. The whole nine yards. Perfect for a party.Would I go back? Probably not. Would I hold my event there? I don't think so. Would I look at an invite to go there and consider it in the future? Yes I would.",

I can say that my late night stopover here was an absolute hoot. Fitting squarely into the \"so bad it's good\" category of things to do, I was \"impressed\" with the DJ's selections of cheesy 80s music, the Dallas-esque garb of many of the ladies on hand and most especially the fact that you're allowed to dance on the tables. Well, one specifically designed table with steps on either side of its length, that is. Cocktails are de rigueur here (around ten quid a pop) but there's a decent selection of beers (I had Staropramen) at reasonable prices. I'd go back just for the laughs. I'm mildly curious about the dinnertime preformances here as well.",

For appetizers we ordered the peppered tuna (this was so yummy we ordered two, A+), the shrimp tempura (A+) and the chicken dumpling (B-). For entrees we ordered the Sirloin on hot rocks (A+) and the Sea Bass (A). Dessert was not exciting as the dinner selections but the crowd and entertainment made up for it! When we first arrived the place was very buzzy, with the crowd adding to the general ambiance of the scene. It was loud, but in a good way to me because it meant everyone was chatting and having a great time. We were there for 2 hours and saw 3-4 bits, most of them acrobatic in nature. 4 appetizers, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, 1 cocktail, 2 bottles of wine and 188\u00a3 later the we were pretty happy with our experience. So if you are in London and are in need of some relaxing, carefree fun, go to Circus!",

    "text": "I too, came here for a comp brunch menu tasting. I think when the restaurant originally opened in covent garden it was all about the evening, but now the owners are testing the waters with brunch and lunch to take advantage of their central location.Designed by Tom Dixon, it gives a new twist to cabaret - as diners enjoy Pan-American cuisine, performers nightly twist and flip their way down the communal high table whilst the rest of the restaurant looks on. Decorated with reflective walls and huge mirror balls, it's the perfect place for a pre-theatre cocktail and snack or a fun group meal. The restaurant has three distinct sections which can be hired separately or exclusively as a whole. For late nights, DJ's get the after-dinner mood going until 2am from Tuesdays to Saturdays.On this particular Sunday morning, I chose an orange juice ( not freshly squeezed I don't believe ) and the Caesar Salad with cornbread crutons. Most brunch items were priced from between \u00a38 - \u00a310ish, so not too extortionate. There were spiced crab cakes, pancakes with syrup, a full breakfast or even a burger.My Salad was OK, huge slices of breast chicken ( skin on so I peeled it off ) but part of the chicken was bit fatty and inedible. Corn bread was a different touch and the crispy bacon and leaves with chunky shaved parmesan were fine.My friend had toasted bagels with smoked salmon and poached eggs and hollandaise. Even I was disappointed when she cut into her eggs and they were hard-boiled!My other friend's beef burger seemed to be the triumph, juicy patty piled high with slaw, gherkins, cheese etc and nice-lookking rustic fries on the side.I probably would go back here in the evening to test it out, but hopefully the food is better then.I'll be honest, I think the main draw here is the kitch entertainment rather than the food. Don't get lost on your way to the toilet - shiny black doors with minimal signage abound, leaving you feeling lost in the tardis if you take a wrong turn.",

Main feeling as I walked out was regret at all the other amazing restaurants in London we could have gone to for the same money.  Decor looks sumptuous on the website gallery but it is actually quite plastic and tacky inside. Tried 4/5 of the dim sum dishes, which were ok but nothing too special. New York beef dish was nice but really not worth \u00a330 (literally was just 6/7 mouthfuls of beef laid out on hot stones). Barrimundi was overcooked and again a really mean portion for \u00a320; worse still, what I thought was a pastry casing turned out to be paper! No accompanying vegetables or salad to speak of (apparently you had to order these seperately) which I find astounding given the price of the mains. Best thing food-wise was the desserts, chocolate fondant and chocolate sphere were delicious though I suspect not even made in the restaurant. Wouldn't have minded all this had the entertainment been good, but I would say it was underwhelming and more like 'opportunity knocks' than a circus. I was expecting fire-eating, jugglers etc etc \u00a0in our two hour slot we saw two contortionists, a rather uninspiring transvestite and a couple of tap dancers. Hopefully it's better on a weekend (we went on a Thursday night) however I will not be going back to find out I'm afraid.",

The only thing they did well were the frites and the hush puppies- well at least they could cook those The bartender could use a lesson in how to make a lemon drop as well.

This was fine for us because we were planning to head off, but may be worth checking this at time of booking, if you plan to be in there a while. The concept is a winner. You have dinner whilst watching various performances on a stage a few feet from your table. All the performances were entertaining and impressive. The performances last about 5 minutes each and there is about 20 minute break between. Our waiter was excellent, informal, which works for this venue, and for us, but other people may be taken aback as he sits himself down whilst taking your order. The food was okay. Not the best meal I've ever had, but it was fine and I was focused on the performances as that's really why you visit a place like Circus. The cocktails were pretty good, I tried three and enjoyed two of them. I would return, perhaps just for drinks, and maybe a bit later on the evening.",

I can't speak to the relative value for the money, as I am always going for work and I can expense every last pound. Where to begin? Well ... the food, I guess. It's all pretty good. I appreciate the indication of gluten, though I will say, the first time I went, when there was a \"G\" on the menu item, that meant it was gluten free. Then, the next time, the \"G\" meant that the item contained gluten. Uhhh ... I almost ordered a bunch of food I couldn't eat. Thankfully I am not an idiot and I know what I am not able to consume. Still. That's weird. It'd be like deciding to one day change the side of the roads that you drive on. You know ... to match the rest of the world that wasn't colonized by Britain.Anyways. Kumquat caipirinha is very good. Wine list is decent, too. Service is alright. Once, I think our server was on coke. She was seriously ugly, too. But. Who cares.The show! Alright. I'm gonna say it. Watching the act with the ripped dude swinging around on chains to some dark rock music ... that's about as close as I have come to wondering if I was meant to play for the other team.

    "text": "All eyes on me in the centre of the ring just like a circus! Sorry I was obviously channeling Britney there for some reason (probably because I'm reviewing a bar called Circus and she did a song with the same name... coincidence?!). Anyway, I met some friends here on a Friday night for some after work drinks, which I eventually made after walking past the bar three times without seeing it! No proper sign, just a man standing by a door to the back and beyond.We didn't get a table for the food, but looking at the menu it seemed very overpriced for Dim Sum. I suppose you're paying for the entertainment as well... which if you're on the main table is spectacular. This place is a mix between restaurant, bar and big top. If you're lucky enough (most likely pay extra) to sit on the main table, you sit on what looks like a wide, white catwalk. After each course the whole place is entertained by a circus act that performs up and down this long table, often nearly hitting people in the face and knocking drinks everywhere, such drama! We were stood in the cocktail bar area with decent tasting cocktails (too much ice) at about \u00a39 each and could oversee the drama unfold. We were treated to the delectable (and some undelectable) sights of a drag cabaret act, a burlesque Alice in Wonderland, a contortionist and an aerial hoop act. All impressive (I couldn't do any of these things and my legs do NOT look that good in fishnets) but I couldn't help feeling it fell flat. Possibly because having seen Cirque du Soleil my expectation of a circus act are SO much higher than before.Good night though, wouldn't pay for food or go racing back",

However, we were unlucky enough to have London's worst chain smoking server, Marine. This was meant to be a romantic and fun date night, but her lack of attentiveness and inability to properly place our order, let alone check on us as the courses came, made the experience right shit! Their small bottle of unfiltered sake also costs \u00a320 when the actual cost should warrant the larger bottle of that brand which we frequently have purchased elsewhere. One major positive is that the menu does clearly label which items are veggie or gluten free friendly, which is important to me, even if my options were rather limited. If you want the atmosphere and entertainment value be sure to ask to sit in someone else's section. That being said, as someone that has lived/experienced fine dining in NYC, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas...I would not return, even if they paid me...They can thank our lousy server because everything else was decent.",

But that's why circus has some relatively good cocktails to knock back whilst that happens when you don't know what to do with your childhood anymore. As of that wasn't enough, they had dancing drag acts and dancers grace the table where people were eating. If you're ocd about having feet on the table, this place isn't for you.I only wish the music in between the acts wasn't so boring and i also wish that the drinks were less iced up.",

What a great concept rather than having one show per night. We were only here for just over an hour and still managed to see two spectacular performers come up to the main table and execute a flawless 5 minute show of their talent.

    "text": "I decided to celebrate my birthday at Circus restaurant as I believed it would offer something different, new, and exciting. So I reserved 23 seats for a birthday dinner on a Thursday night.The restaurant was quite difficult to find as there was no obvious sign - just a black door, a bouncer, and a small A4 sized sign that stood on a stand on the side. On entry, the staff did make an effort to impress but the size of the restaurant failed to do so. It was much smaller than I thought it'd be but the decor was appealing, with a funky and futuristic edge. I was highly disappointed to find that they had cramped us on across two separate tables. It was a very tight squeeze indeed! I was also disappointed to find that parties with 9+ guests had to resort to a 'sharing menu', of which we were served a selection of food in proportion to the amount of guests there were. I wasn't warned of this beforehand and so my guests and I had no real choice in what to eat. This was frustrating because first of all, the food we received was not worth \u00a340, and secondly and my friend who is allergic to nuts couldn't eat the majority of the food because nuts were sprinkled on practically everything!!! She had to pretty much starve on my birthday!Other unfortunate points of the night were that I couldn't bring my own birthday cake, my table didn't receive some platters that the other table did, and the cost of the drinks were outrageous! Furthermore, the service was quite slow and scarce, which made the night drag on. The cherry on top was the large discrepancy in the bill, which was later found to be at their fault and was resolved by closing time.Luckily, though these matters were highly frustrating, I didn't allow it to get to me much as I was only too concerned with having a good night. Fortunately, the performances were entertaining, and there was a nice lively atmosphere in the air. We also received a glass of champagne with our meal (which is always a good thing)! For those who wish to dine here, I'd suggest it is more ideal for smaller groups (with a lot more money in their pockets) who are looking for a different and exciting dining experience.",

At the time of my visit, Circus was a fairly new opening in London...but well worth it indeed!!!From the easy booking by Lucy B. (fabulous), to the food - a nod to the Cajun/Southern delights of the USA and the amazing performances; this place should be on your list of venues to visit in London.We dined on so many scrummy treats I can't remember them all but the corned bread and Cajun prawns stick out in my mind...as does the Cherry Martini, woo hoo!! Everything was fresh & cooked very well.The servers were attentive and helpful to some in my group who were not so clued up on the menu choices. Tables could be spaced more as some were quite snug in areas. The 'Top Table' accommodates about 20 I think, and is where the performances take place (minus your food on the table of course). My table was just next to it & we had a perfectly non-obstructed view of the action.The first performance was a lovely lady engaging in some risqu\u00e9 fire play. That was followed by an aerial act and these alternated for the duration of the evening (about 3-4 performances in total). Each was highly entertaining. Lots of oohs and aahs from the customers. Pictures are permitted but NO FLASHES as you could blind one of the performers and heaven knows we don't want to see the damage that could cause.If you haven't been to the Circus, get down there for the high wire fun...and to my delight, not a clown in sight.",

After entering through a non-descript street entrance, you can let the front desk know you'd like to go to the bar if you're not there for dinner and they will lead you into the scene...This is a place that you have to check out yourself to get the full effect -- Designer did an amazing job, kinda has a Cirque du Soleil type of feel. Not the circus of your childhood that's for sure -- no dumbo and peanuts - and thankfully no scary clowns when I was there (I hate clowns, they creep me out!). Bar is located in the back with a view of the periodic entertainment - misc performers including cabaret style dancers and acrobats. They have a unique selection of signature cocktails and excellent bartenders who will nail any drink you ask for. This is the place to go to for a proper drink and check out something fun- don't take the place too seriously - just enjoy! Note: I've only been to check out the bar, so this review is only based on my experience at the bar. I can't comment on how good/bad the food is. But, I can say that it's really loud in there and hard to probably hear people talking in the main dining area - unless, you don't want to talk to your dinner date *eep*.",

I am not kidding, a pathetic juggling attempt perhaps?. \u00a0Were they trying to do comedy? \u00a0It was painful really.Then, the food. \u00a0Where do I begin. \u00a0Ok, here: Southern Comfort Food? \u00a0At a cabaret in LONDON??? \u00a0HAVE YOU BEEN TO LOUISIANA? \u00a0Apparently not due to the fact that they butchered everything on the menu, everything, even the boodly crisps, in fact, the ketchup was bad! \u00a0Don't ask my why I ordered the tuna tartar, but I had a bite and almost booted. (I later grabbed a bite at Hospital across the street, a smart choice). \u00a0So I moved on to the drinks. Another very underwhelming point. \u00a0Too small portions, not good, and too pricey to get me wasted, especially as they come 30 minutes after you order. \u00a0Boo. \u00a0[if you do go there, for any reason I don't know, order your drinks in threes, trust me]On top of all that, the space is ... just wrong. \u00a0Even for the 9 minutes of performance, total all night, if you are not in the main room, you can't see a freakin thing! \u00a0The ceilings are too low and there are massive columns obstructing any sort of view. \u00a0However, I did have a view of the leaking ceiling, a seriously leaking ceiling, a view of what was basically a faucet in the middle of the dining room, all cracked and spewing, grossss. \u00a0Patrons carefully avoided it and pretended it wasn't there and casually proceeded on with their night. \u00a0HELLO, THE CEILING IS ABOUT TO CAVE IN ON YOU WITH TOILET WATER, THIS IS NOT A COOL PLACE TO STAND AND MAKE FRIENDS.And the service, poor, poor people. \u00a0You messed up my main order, and my drink order, which took 30 minutes to come anyway. \u00a0Then you charged me twice for my main and added on a mysterious drink to the bill. \u00a0After kindly asking you to take it off, you ran away for another 35 minutes until I have to approach you at another table for my god damned bill because I needed to get the hell outta that place, NOW. \u00a0We couldn't have escaped faster. \u00a0Ugh, I still get queesy when I think about it.",

    "text": "I was recently invited to pop along to Circus a venue tucked away amongst the hussle and bustle of Covent Garden. Actually I even walked passed it trying to locate it as it doesn't have a signage above its entrance.. See how exclusive that makes the experience.. Only those in the know eh?I was here to sample their new Christmas menu (ops sorry to mention that word in July) but great venues get booked up really quickly so you'll be glad I've told you. We was offered a sample of their amazing canap\u00e9s.. The food here is a pan Asian fusion which I am all for. I think my favourite of the night was definitely the yellow tail sashimi and the salt and pepper squid.. Yum.\u00a0As you enter the venue, p. s I found it via the menu on the wall outside.. Useful tip! You are risked to your table and a free cloakroom service is available if you are coming after a long day at the office. The main dining area consists in one very long opaque table with little tables scattered around the room. The comfy sofa looking chairs are calling me. The kitchen area is open and viable along the side of the dining area. Our table was very close to the bar, which is great! We also sample some of their amazing wine and even better cocktails (they made a punch with Gingerbread syrup, with grapefruit and vodka) it was devine!However the best part of this venue is the in-house entertainment department they have who design and coordinate the half hourly entertainment on show. Entertainment is provided every night from 6:30pm until 8:00pm and until late during Friday and the weekend. They have singers and performers to enlighten your evening drinks or dinner plans. When we visited there was a group of ladies celebrating a 60 birthday party so the venue caters for all ages (18+) of course!The night we visited we were entertained by fire eating performers, a drag queen singer belting out classics,\u00a0 an aerial display and an acrobatics show. We were all in awe for sure.\u00a0It was definitely a great evening and if this has enticed you to think about it for your next birthday or big party do? Then do check out their website as they have sharing menu for groups. Just a note that for London prices this is average and with the added entertainment element it's definitely worth a treat out.\u00a0I was offered this experience via the lovely Jo from @lovepopupslondon and while a sponsored post all reviews are my own.",

    "text": "What a unique experience! My boyfriend has been doing some work in London so on one of his most recent trips, I tagged along for the ride. He had noticed months ago that Circus is always in the lists for top restaurants in London so he reserved a table for two about a month prior to my arrival. It seems as this is quite necessary, especially if you want a seat with a good view. \u00a0This is absolutely a date night spot. There was one table with a group of girlfriends, but otherwise the restaurant was littered with couples. The dark and seductive ambiance with shimmering lights and small tables make it so that I really would only want to come here on a date. It's incredibly expensive, but the food and drink is pretty fancy and noteworthy. It's tapas style so my boyfriend and I were able to try a few different things which was nice. The Vegetable Sushi Selection which are Roasted & raw seasonal vegetable maki rolls were our favorite. This is quite funny because neither of us are generally fans of sushi. As with food, we ordered a few different cocktails, but we deemed The Carousel as the best. The alcoholic cotton candy that comes with it is definitely a nice addition. We saw 4 out of the 5 acts for the night, each lasting about 5-10 minutes. It was perfect because it gives you a short break from eating and something to talk and laugh about until the next show. Some were silly, some were more awe inspiring, but all entertaining. I will say that I would never recommend sitting at the long table in which the performers do their acts because they don't wipe down or sanitize the table after they are done despite the fact that the people were walking and dancing up there with both their bare feet and shoes. I would gag if the waiter placed my plate back on that table!",

You can take photos but no flash. The drinks were delicious. There are three cons on sitting at the big table. 1) you have to have the set menu. No choice of choosing something else. 2) you have a set time to eat due to the table being the stage. This meant that some of our food disappeared before we had finished. 3) some of the performances were slightly too close up. I would definitely go back but probably to one of the smaller tables.",

Having said that, the service is...aggressive. I guess it was good in the sense that the waitress was always there, but that's just it...she was always there. At one point she refilled my wine glass twice in 60 seconds, even when I hadn't taken a sip. You do feel like you are rushed to eat but maybe they were rushing between acts?The entertainment is good but I was hoping for more. Over 90 minutes we only saw 4 acts and 3 of them were really good though 1 was strange. There isn't really a theme per se; it's a mash up of various talents. It's a good place to go for a special occasion but don't expect a lot in terms of entertainment or experience. But the food is fantastic!",

There were one or two particular groups of people that were highly rowdy and even disturbed the performers yet they were not removed.Its hard to find a place London that does entertainment and food not just good but really really well. So in that instance this place is up there.However i would be wary of coming here again unless i had a really good table like we did on this particular occasion.",

It was dimly lit with candles giving it a nice atmosphere. Our waiter was super nice, funny and helpful, and pointed out some great dishes for us. The menu is pricey! They encourage you to buy and share multiple courses, but I found a starter and main was plenty, but I still made room for the churros dessert! YUMMY! The food was different and full of flavour, I really enjoyed everything I ate especially the date and water chestnut dumplings!The acts were awesome. Amazing talent, quite saucy and also funny at times. They were quite infrequent and I found they did repeat very similar routines. But I loved seeing it twice so I can't complain. Overall it was a brilliant night, great food and great fun =]",

It's Pan Asian fusion and I wouldn't necessarily disagree with their statement \"Michelin-worthy menu\".I'm not a real fan because I prefer my dinners in different atmospheres and it's also a little too pricey for me but Circus is defenitely good for amusement and a treat to the palate.",

Was left rather disappointed, and will not be recommending this to friends and colleagues. There were 15 of us and we went for the main table - so had to take the 'Sharing Menu' at \u00a360 per person + 12.5% service. Booking was relatively straightforward. A \u00a315 per person deposit is required to secure booking, and staff were polite and helpful. Portions were very SMALL so don't come expecting a full meal, and whatever you do don't come hungry. I did worry that the portions were not going to be enough for some of the lads in the group and despite reassurance from the restaurant and people who have been before, my worries came true.Quality of the food was average to good, but DEFINITELY NOT \"Michelin worthy\" as stated on their website. I wasn't impressed when dessert came - they were served in tacky looking plastic bowls! The shows themselves were fairly good, although I have seen better. Each act was a few minutes long and spaced out between courses. Was pretty good cos you can eat and chat to friends in between the acts. After the watershed the acts got more saucy - expect the same acts but with more boobs/pecs on show!This is NOT a place to come for dinner. And certainly NOT a place to come if you're hungry. Come here for drinks and a few nibbles - make sure you reserve a table though as the bar area is small. All in all, I feel rather hard done by as I had an entirely different evening to most other reviewers (on Yelp and elsewhere) I've read. I would not even recommend this place if my boss/clients were paying.",

We did have a bit of trouble finding it, as the outside is vastly more nondescript than the inside. We walked in to a show in progress--an impressive hula hoop act--and the shows just got better as our 2-hour experience continued (we saw 6 in all). My favorites were the blacklit hula hoop act and the dark acrobatic noir that included just the right amount of gunfire. The brachy drag number was a welcome comic relief, as well. To experience as much of the menu as possible, we ordered a smattering of small plates (each more delicious than the last), and a main course to split (completely succulent). We also tried a few of their whimsical cocktails that are stronger than they seem. All in all, a spectacular experience.",

Of course, the best bit is the entertainment. We went for dinner fairly early and the entertainment didn't start until later so we didn't see too much. There is a long table in the venue where the dancers walk onto, which I'm quite relieved I wasn't sat on because I wouldn't have been able to watch the show. As well as this, there were huge loops that came down from the ceiling and someone started hanging from it with ribbons.It's basically a circus show to watch while you eat delicious food.
