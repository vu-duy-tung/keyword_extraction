The decor is really clean, minimalist and spacious. There is a really cute bar area too to have close access to the booze while your slurp on. The servers are super friendly and helpful. I wasn't really clear on the various types of Pho soups and noodles, and they helped me make my decisions no problem.There are lots of options on the menu, from veg options to meat and seafood. Also, there are add on and extra options, so you can really customise your soup, which is awesome. I opted for the traditional Pho soup with prawns and vegetable stock broth. It was absolutely delish, especially with all the wonderful add on herbs and spices they brought along with my soup. They added so much delicious, spicy flavour to the meal.",

    "text": "Hooray for Pho in Soho! There are a few others in London as part of the same chain, but this place is soup-er. I know. That pun is so awful, but I just had to use it.My first time was with Lizzie G on Tuesday, I had the spicy chicken Pho - which was to die for - and we shared the summer spring rolls. Nom.It was weird to be offered a bib to eat with though. Especially as NOBODY ELSE in the whole place had been offered the same. Shrug. It was pretty useful, we worked it the best we could :)I went again on Friday, this time trying the lemongrass beef bun noodles, served with a fresh salad and vegetable spring roll. Also gorgeous. Fresh, tasty and only \u00a311 with a beer on the side. Definitely my new favourite haunt. Walk in, get a great meal for a good price. WIN.",

Faves on the menu include goi cuon tom (fresh summer rolls with prawns and fresh herbs) and goi xoai (spicy green mango salad served with pork, dried shrimp and peanuts), the classic pho tai (thinly sliced steak served in beef stock with rice noodles and fresh herbs) and bun cha gio new nuong (pork and lemongrass meatballs with vermicelli noodles and stir fried toppings, fresh herbs, veggie spring roll and peanuts) - alll filling and certainly tasty!

This place is one of a chain and seemed to get decent reviews so we popped as we were in Soho.The waitress was friendly and the restaurant was busy- it filled up while we were there- about six when we arrived.We tried both the chicken and the prawn summer rolls- both good although I preferred the prawn goi cuon. Both the dips were lovely.My friend had the prams and noodles and he loved it. I had the Beef Pho with fillet beef- I chose the spicy option. It was good but not amazing. I think I would recommend choosing the normal Pho and add the flavours yourself. We shared a large Lao beer- nice and crisp- and then we both had a Vietnamese coffee. It always tastes like there is some chocolate in the coffee. The meal only cost \u00a340 including service and was a tasty. I would recommend dropping in and trying Pho if you are nearby.",

    "text": "How Vietnamese food should not look like can be seen on my blog herehungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026 I met my Vietnamese food loving friend Naomi one Sunday in Soho with the aim to finally try out Viet in Greek Street,which has been strongly recommended to me by Leluu (who is Vietnamese and therefore must know where to get the most authentic and delicious Vietnamese grub). To our unimaginable disappointment,Viet was closed. We were not ready to give up yet on our quest for Vietnamese food in Soho and ended up at Pho,which is part of a small chain named after the Vietnamese national dish,in Wardour Street. It might have been our mistake to not actually go for the pho but instead order my usual triad of papaya salad,fresh spring rolls and Bun Cha. Whatever the reason,the food at Pho turned out to be the most westernised and least authentic Vietnamese I have had anywhere in London. Paired with rude and unpleasant service,I won't exactly hurry back. 1. The Papaya Salad Vietnamese papaya salad is one of my favourite dishes of all time and I take it personally when it is done badly. The papaya salad at Pho had only very remote resemblance to the versions I enjoyed in Vietnam or at the more authentic Vietnamese places in and around Kingsland Road in East London. As you can probably see on this picture,the salad consisted mostly of other vegetables,for example loads of yellow and red peppers,while being almost devoid of green papaya. Apart from the fact that I thoroughly dislike peppers,they don't have anything to do in a Vietnamese papaya salad! I would not have ordered the dish if it had been stated on the menu that it was really a red and yellow pepper/cucumber/carrot and a little bit papaya salad. In addition the salad lacked any kind of spice and was garnished only with some measly herbs. 2. Fresh Summer Rolls My rant continues. The fresh summer rolls mainly consisted of noodles and I didn't pick up any fresh herbs at all. For those of you who have never eaten Vietnamese I should mention that what makes Vietnamese dishes so distinctly delicious is the cornucopia of fresh herbs such as coriander,spear mint,fish mint,Vietnamese mint,Thai basil,Cockscomb Mint,etc etc. If you have tasted this delicate freshness once,you can never go back to a tuned down,westernised version. The peanut sauce was nice though. (here some picture and recipe on how summer rolls should look like) 3. Bun Cha The Bun Cha with lemongrass and chicken was ok,by no means great but certainly edible. Again the dish came with hardly any fresh herbs which just made it a bit bland. Here the rude waitress came into play. She didn't seem in a very good mood to begin with,and she asked us whether we wanted this dish spicy or not. Of course we wanted it spicy! The plate we got served was the mildest thing ever,so when we mentioned this to the waitress (thinking that maybe she got our order mixed up) she seemed positively annoyed,she just pointed to the table with the condiments and told us to put some chili oil on. I don't know how you feel,but I do prefer some fresh chili to chili oil. I really don't want to drown my healthy lunch in grease. If you have never had proper Vietnamese before,I am sure you will quiet enjoy Pho. The food is not bad per se,it is relatively cheap and the atmosphere and interior is actually really nice. For me however,Pho is just too far away from being authentic Vietnamese to get a lot of pleasure out of the food.",

    "text": "Ate lunch here today, on a day when all of Soho seemed to be wiped out by an apocalyptic virus (actually just a Bank Holiday after New Year). Despite the lack of movement on the streets, Pho Soho was hopping, to the point that around 1pm couples looking for a table were told there was a half hour wait (hint: give up if you are in a group!). We lucked in by getting a table by the window as soon as we walked in. I have to say that the staff are very well trained, \u00a0friendly, and just well organized. This is clearly a place that prided itself in service and it shows. As suggested by other reviewers the decor is pleasant and minimalist (bamboo table tops; wicker lighting shades on the walls; exposed brick). This was fine, but I would have been just as happy with formica table tops, florescent lighting, and surly service, if only the food was great. Which it wasn't. It was not terrible; but at the same time it certainly lacked any wow factor. I had a spicy mushroom and tofu pho, and while the spicing was OK, it wasn't particularly complex, and had none of the stronger notes you would expect from a good pho. The mushrooms, didn't taste particularly good; worse the accompanying cilantro was yellowing and a bit wilted, as were the bean sprouts (perhaps due to some sourcing problem over Christmas/New Year??). I wonder if the fact I am eating vegetarian/vegan fare makes my experience different from the other reviewers, but my honest thought is simply that the pho here is too westernised to really hit the mark. I am going to go looking in the Kingsland Road area for something a little rougher, pungent and more authentic.",

However, on my return to the UK, my search for a similar level of pho-nomenon has been met with disappointment so far.I was therefore excited to find enthusiastic reviews from fellow Yelpers for this chain. I headed there for a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon.There were a healthy number of diners for the time of day. The menu is basic but had the required range of phos I was looking to sample.I started with the chicken goi cuon ga - summer rolls with chicken breast and herbs. Unfortunately, I found the wrapper a little thick, which made the dish heavy rather than light and zingy.I went the whole hog with the pho and chose the Pho Bo Dac Biet, which had brisket, steak and meatballs. For me, pho lives or dies with the soup and while acceptable, the soup here didn't have the depth of flavour of the best phos I've tasted. The meat content was OK and the meat was tender.Pho's food did taste like that of a chain restaurant, which is reasonable I suppose given that it is a chain restaurant! However, I still prefer the pho at Cam Phat just down the road in Chinatown, especially as it's cheaper.",

They do not smile, they answer rudely, do not make eye contact and do not make you feel welcome at all. I won't be coming back again.",

Vermicelli was a hot mess: \"grilled\" beef looked blanched and lacked any symptoms of ever being near a charcoal grill or, for that matter, a marinade, the noodles were thick Italian-style vermicelli (potentially half rice flour? certainly not pure rice) rather than rice stick vermicelli, the herbs consisted of one sprig of mint and three of cilantro, with no basil in sight, and the veg spring roll tasted stale, and was fried to the point of being a lethal weapon. Extra star only because ingredients did seem fresh, aside from the spring roll. You're in central London. Go elsewhere.",

    "text": "Pho is an exciting new chain that has opened in a few locations around London and in Brighton. It joins the new wave of Far East Asian fusion/modern eateries; Busaba Eathai (Thai), Wagamama (Japanese), Ping Pong (Dim Sum/Chinese).This indeed, is like a Vietnamese version of Busaba Eathai or Wagamama. A lot of the food is similar to them like the Pho Noodle Soup (like Chilli Ramen or the choice of tea, similar to Ping Pong (e.g. the flower tea that never fails to amaze some patrons, as if they're watching a David Blaine video)In case you didn't know, Vietnamese food is similar to Thai food, with French influence (previous colonial rulers).If you order the Pho Noodle Soup, \u00a0they may indeed offer you a bib, as the other review said. I think they must offer it to the most in need, since like the other reviewer, i'm pretty sure I was the only patron eating with a bib. Not very cool when eating out, but then again, not very cool splashing Pho Noodle soup on your white shirt, unless you're going for a tie dye look.I must say, it was very cosy, and intimate, something unusual for the recent trend 'nu-wave' of far east asian eateries. So I recommend it as a fun, urban, 'cool' place to go , especially if you're a Vietnamese novice.Obviously, if you're looking for traditional authentic Vietnamese food, you may wish to try alternatives, but I personally highly recommend Pho, if you're in a small group/couple.",

The first hit was a complexity of different herbs and spices that were amazing but after that, they seem to meld into an ending note where they seem to battle each other and tasted weird. I was definitely not keen on polishing off the soup at the end. Very much a anglo-sized version which will not please those who are looking for the real thing. Did I mention that the service was quite bad too? The staff were happily huddling away in a corner chilling out instead of paying attention to the diners.",

I checked out the menu before walking in and saw that one third of their menu was pho noodle soup which is always a good sign for a Vietnamese restaurant. The decor is done in dark tones with exposed brick walls and red ceilings. There were only two other people eating so service was fast. I ordered the pho with beef slices and brisket. My food came out pretty quick and although it looked good, the flavors were bland. Adding hot sauce and oyster sauce helped the soup but not the tasteless beef and flat noodles. (Why didn't they mention that they serve the pho with flat rice noodles? I thought it was standard to serve it with the thin ones.) Overall the food was average but pricey. You're definitely paying for the ambiance. You can go to any hole in the wall Vietnamese restaurant in San Francisco and find much better pho.",

It's quirky like that, but cool nonetheless in all its confusingness (see what I did there?). I also found it to be unbearably hot, like 25 degrees but that aside, service was attentive and fun, and I sweated not so noticeably on an otherwise fine night. The food was a little bit of a let down if I'm going to be honest. I eat pho on a regular at many different restaurants, and have dined in many of them from California to Budapest and what this Pho serves, while being creative and ample in terms of its numerous options, falls short of that authentic Vietnamese earth moving, soul invigorating goodness.NOTE TO THE CHEF: Use rice noodles (b\u00e1nh pho).

(which happens after about 7 most nights these days...) this place is great.VERY affordable Soho dinner.The biggest problem is anticipating what the worst food envy will be on the table dependant on opting for a pho bowl, fried noodles, rice or curry dish.Vietnamese coffee is stellar, and though quite pricey- it does come 'properly' served with the 'Phin filter' on top percolating richly spice-infused caffeine onto a handsome dollop of condensed milk. Can't do without one, every time.Last time I ventured here, their gas stopped working halfway through the night and we had to wait over an hour to get our food in the end. However- they did tell us immediately and brought us a selection of summer rolls to snack on and without us even complaining, cut our \u00a360 bill to \u00a325. Wow. Go Pho!",

    "text": "Continuing our drinking trek about Soho, it was time to stop for dinner. On this cold, blustery February night, I've chosen Pho to warm up with a steaming bowl of Pho. I made my choice after messaging fellow Yelper from London Meena R. Pho's atmosphere is nice and cozy, with upbeat (slightly loud) music. After a 15 minute wait we were seated. We began with apps of Em Hai San ( a delicious roll of prawn, crab, and pork), Summer rolls, and Muc chien gion (squid in lime juice, surprisingly good as I'm not a big squid fan) Our Pho selections were the steak, and the Combo (steak, brisket and meatball). All were very delicious and satisfyingly filling. The food's a 5 star here, I've rated Pho a 4 due to cramped conditions (got jostled about during the 15 minute wait) a bit of server inattentiveness, and the overly loud music made it a bit hard to converse. The food itself is definitely recommended and is worth a return visit. Thanks again, Meena!!",

Good job on this one.Restaurant: Quite characteristic, but in terms of customer appeal, this place relies more on its central location than the quality taste of its food. Their pho isn't terribly bad; it's just not as good as other pho restaurants (like the Shoreditch area).",

So while it might not be the most authentic place to get pho, I enjoy it for what it is!Personally I'm not a big fan of soup so I don't ever get pho. My other half does though and loves it (a tip - ask for a bib if you're having soup, or just a messy eater!). I tried some of his last time we went and I really, really didn't like it - but I think that's down to me and nothing to do with the food.I always get the Pho Xao with beef for a main, and we get an order of summer rolls to share. This time they brought peanut sauce with the summer rolls and it was even better than the normal sauce I usually have.Strangely my noodles came with chicken. I'm pretty sure I ordered beef but hey, I like chicken, so I ate it and didn't complain. Plus it's always possible I misordered...The service was fine, food quick, and all in all, a pleasant meal.",

Yesterday afternoon I was desperately looking for a restaurant that had quite filling dishes with low calories as I am currently on a very strict diet, and a friend suggested I had a look at Pho's. I was honestly surprised to see so many dishes with so few calories, but I thought that they'd probably be quite smallish dishes that'd leave me hungry for more. I couldn't be more wrong. I've had the Ph nm rm: , a rice-noodles soup with enoki, shiitake and \u00a0button mushrooms. Chose the vegetable stock instead of the chicken stock: 376 Kcal. Admittedly, I wouldn't usually order anything that doesn't have meat or fish in it and I was expected quite a bland taste from this dish. Sweet baby Jesus was I wrong. It was so packed full of flavours, the soup comes served with a mini-tray of raw extra herbs to add to it, as well as some cheeky SUPER EXTRA MEGA HOT chili peppers. I left with a full tummy and was very happy with the experience throughout, I only wish the tables & seats for two were a teeny tiny bit more comfortable and spacious. Will definitely go back next time I fancy a guilt-free dinner out.",

    "text": "Oh dear... Ok let me start off by saying that I DO fancy myself a pho expert and I am very surprised by the great reviews this place has. My husband and I were meandering the streets of SoHo upon arriving in London, my eyes fixated on the Pho sign and he knew that was our final destination. The decor was nice, dark and casual, with exposed red brick and wooden tables lit with candles, which created a nice mood for a restaurant, and definitely nicer than the majority of pho places I've ever been too.The staff was super friendly, but painfully slow. We were seated in the window seat by the door. We waited a good 10 minutes before anyone gave us menus. It took another 10 minutes for them to take our order! \u00a0I was a little leery when I had to correct the waitress's horrendous butchering if the menu items. After we were able to place our order, we had to flag someone down to remind them that we didn't get our drinks yet, and then again when they brought the wrong drinks! We also notice during all of this waiting that our original server had left for the day! \u00a0I'm glad we flagged someone else down, else we would have been there ALL day!I had the pho dac diet, which had no tripe or tendon, this is a cardinal sin of authentic pho, you can not call it Dac Biet without the two! The pho noodles were huge flat fettuccini sized rice noodles. I really didn't like this modified version of my favorite comfort food. The broth was watery and overly bland! My husband ordered the bun ga, which again was not made with vermicelli noodles, but of a much thicker udon size noodle! (Umm, not even Vietnamese!) I just couldn't understand the patrons filtering in for this place. It couldn't be the food! This place albeit cute, is a gross misrepresentation of what Vietnamese cuisine should be, maybe it should be called an 'interpretation' of pho restaurant. The staff needs to really focus on service and less on each other, they all congregated in the back when I walked by, no one else seemed to be as annoyed as we were, but i don't believe anyone was in a hurry either.Sorry yelpers, I don't want to be overly critical, but I was most definitely underwhelmed by the whole experience. I hope this isn't what people think Vietnamese food tastes like this!! It sooo doesn't! Pho is very overpriced for what it offered! This place needs to focus more on the service and the food rather than dumping money into the ambiance, I don't know anyone that comes to a restaurant for ambiance without the other two components in play.",

I had a really nice pineapple and coconut smoothie, with the spring rolls (seriously tasted incredible with the peanut sauce), and a tofu noodle soup. The tofu was awesome.. some of the best I've had. The atmosphere was lovely.. ambient, chilled and casual. It's a shame that as we were starting to put our coats on, a pair of seat vultures came through the door and bluntly said \"are you leaving?\" and continued to make their move, despite us still sitting down, but you can't have it all, I guess.. had to hurry to get out of the door because i'd had enough rudeness projected my way that day. Ugh.EDIT:I've decided Pho do the best spring rolls I've ever had. Teamed with the peanut sauce they're just amazing. On our last visit we had a creamy coconut broth. It was literally incredible.

    "text": "Decided on Vietnamese while in Soho, and this seems to be of lower pricing compared to the competitors nearby. I wanted a more authentic experience versus the others nearby, which were more fusion. Also, I was craving for pho, and it supposed to be a cheap street food, I wasn't keen to pay more just because they served it on a fancier plate, smaller portion and decorated fancier and charge you a premium for that. Overall, the taste is very average, nothing special. The noodles were obviously taken out of the fridge very recently, as it wasn't piping hot, and it was still was quite stick together, ie. not stirred and cooked properly long enough. So, it had that mass produced factory plasticky taste to it. Fresh flat rice noodles should be slick, smooth and really soft. The broth was tasty, and the usual side of bean sprouts and greens were there. Though, I did return home with a headache an hour later. I attribute it to the usual high MSG content, many pho Vietnamese restaurants (a common feature globally) use in their soups. We arrived after 9pm, and it was still busy; we were waiting for a table for 15 minutes, which isn't uncommon for Soho restaurants. Ambiance was okay, though a tad dark for my taste. Service was excellent, as we were waited on by a really friendly and enthusiastic lady. However, our food was brought over by a different, rather impatient and grumpy lady. Reading the reviews here before coming over, I could see how many have complained about the poor service - if you were served/waited on by this other waitress. The fresh spring roll with prawns were good. The pandan flavoured pancake with desiccated coconut with ice-cream was a bit disappointing; it's obvious it's made elsewhere, as it tastes rubbery as if it's been made a long time ago and preserved. Pricing is decent in this part of London. For two bowls of pho, a starter, a dessert and two beers, it came to \u00a340.",

The quantity was not so bad for a little less than \u00a38. Their Prawn crackers for \u00a32.5 \u00a0though, was stale and unappealing and really should be given out for free. \u00a0Most of the mains are approximately \u00a38 - \u00a310:- Their Pho Xao, which is stir-fried flat noodles are pretty good as well. - The Pho Bo Hue, which is hot and spicy brisket beef soup (served with a chilli shrimp paste) is bland and unappealing overall, and there was almost no meat in it.-Their Buns look amazing, though I didn't try. I was told there is also no meat.Why I would not go back? Well it's high prices for low quantity overall. The noodles were very unfilling and I'd much rather go to an actual Vietnamese-run restaurant in Chinatown or elsewhere than a hip Soho joint. I've had much better vietnamese food for lower prices.Also, note that their food is not spicy at all, even if you ask for it super spicy. They also do not have any rice selection besides curry.Overall, I say the quality of the food is decent, a little on the expensive price, and the quantity is small. The ambience is quite nice though.

Only thing I'd say is there were hardly any noodles in my bowl... It was pure broth! Man can't survive alone on broth you know! Anyhoo delicious and defo worth visiting",

    "text": "Met up my friends for lunch on a busy bank holiday Sunday. Waiter was apologetic that no table was available but after around 10mins got seated. Most of us tried the pho while I decided to try the veggie spring rolls ban (vermicelli) Drinks came pretty rapidly (definitely recommend the refreshingly zesty iced tea) Unfortunately we waited for nearly half an hour before getting our orders, despite a group nearby arriving 15 mins after we did and got their food first. Another waiter (long blonde, tied back hair guy) served our orders and told explained about the condiments accompanying the pho, warning it could be very spicy. At the same time my friend, who has a high tolerance for spicy food, dumped all his condiments into his bowl. The waiter rudely said to him \"are you listening?\" before shortly walking away. Unbelievable! My fiance had the 3 mushrooms pho which were a little bland but my veggie spring rolls ban was mouthwateringly delicious! Definitely would recommend the ban and to dip in the soy sauce accompanying it too. Price was reasonable for the food and central location. Although the ban was good, the long wait and rude waiter tainted the overall experience.",

    "text": "Faux-pho. That's what it felt like for me. I had heard a lot about Vietnamese food and walking by on a cold and rainy day with a sore throat, this called out to me. I thought a hot soup was exactly what I needed so why not try it Vietnamese style.I ordered the Pho Ga with chicken broth and chicken breast and added button mushrooms to it \u00a0(they let you mix and match your pho specifications even if it's not on the menu which is nice too) because it seemed like a failsafe way to ease into a new cuisine. When it came, the broth was pretty watery and tasteless and the entire dish was bland. I didn't enjoy the mushrooms either. I've heard Vietnamese broth has depth, but this had none. \u00a0It makes me glad I had that sore throat, otherwise I would have gotten no pleasure whatsoever out of this dish. The spring rolls were okay, very mediocre and nothing special. My friend had the spicy chicken pho and that was much better than mine, but still wasn't impressive in any way. After awhile I did try to spice mine up with the strong garlic chili sauce on the table, but even though it's a decent sauce, it couldn't save the lack of broth flavor. \u00a0The best I can say for this place was that the pineapple mocktail was not bad. The place itself is small and crowded, but if you're just two people you can probably get a table without a wait, like I did. It's got a very hip feel to it, with wicker lamps and one side of the tiny room having a brick wall and the other wooden. I think the biggest problem here is the service. The waitress seemed friendly at first but then made a lot of mistakes and didn't seem to care. We had to ask two different waitresses for spoons because the first just plonked down the plates of pho without giving us spoons or the plate of accompanying herbs and bean sprouts that they serve it with and then didn't bother to come back. After waiting awhile we asked a second waitress who also ran away without acknowledging us and finally came back and dumped two spoons with herb plates on our table as quick as she could so she could leave. I know they're busy but it's a bit odd not to have anyone care about giving you a utensil while your food gets cold. The waitress also got our orders wrong. She brought us a prawn chip appetiser as well which we didn't order (but since we like prawn chips we didn't mention it and decided to keep it). She also got my friend's order wrong and brought chicken pho instead of prawn and flat noodles instead of bun noodles. When we told her, she went and got her notepad so she could show us that she had written down the number for the chicken pho (which we didn't order but she didn't believe us) and my hungry friend gave up and kept the order we had. Verdict: Not a fan",

They begrudgingly agreed. I had pho and the roast beef was a chunk it was overcooked. There were two chunks of beef in my bowl. \u00a0The noodles were all wrong for the type of dish. I had disgusting chunky meaty spring roll that was lukewarm. The worst part about it was that my friend ordered a vermicelli bowl with chicken which is one of the easiest things to prepare and they couldn't even make that right. Not to mention she ended up with food poisoning for the rest of the night. It completely ruined the entire day and evening and we are only here visiting for a couple of days.

    "text": "Everytime we walked by, we always smell a strong broth. So for the first time, we stopped by for an early dinner, since I was craving for comfort food. The stars are given for the ambience. I loved the atmosphere in the restaurant, but not so much of the food. As a foodie, I have eaten at many pho restaurants including in Vietnam. So, I do have some expectations for my noodles. Firstly, and most importantly, there was no taste in the broth - very very disappointing since you smell it walking by. Secondly, the noodles used, is not what is normally used for authentic pho. It was thicker which are usually used by the Chinese, not Vietmanese. In addition, the noodles tasted like it came out from a package. Next, the pho I asked for was the Hanoi beef with garlic. There was no garlic taste and the beef was soooooo tough. My jaw was tired after the bowl of noodles. No exaggeration. The other two bowls of pho my friends had were no different...We also tried the fried pork roll (which was meh.. and the sauce which came with it was really made to fit British taste buds rather than authentic...) and the morning glory with garlic. The highlight of the night was the morning glory - which is like steamed with garlic on top... Very simple. So unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. The smell was like false advertisement. Pretty sure I won't be back. Oh btw, they add a pound to your bill for charity without asking. I don't mind donating but I don't like how it's just added on.",

I gave it at-least a 2 star because the presentation of the restaurant is very nice, and if you're taking someone who is ignorant to the experience of quality Pho you can at-least give off the impression that this is a nice and fancy Vietnamese restaurant. Came here at night right after landing from my flight and was really craving asian food for some reason. This place was near where I was staying and it looked nice so I thought to give it a try. The service was very slow and the servers just gave off this weird pretentious attitude when I was asking about the menu. I ordered Pho and spring rolls, I figured I was at a Vietnamese restaurant called \"Pho\" and these are basic Vietnamese dishes so they must be good here. I was disappointed with my Pho and Springrolls, \u00a0basically the food was expensive and it wasn't that good.",

They did not skim out the beef scum so I had nasty collection of beef scum in my soup. The soup was just missing something.. I had to add sriracha sauce and extra lime to make it edible.

    "text": "I have never been too impressed by the Pho chain, but I do admit that it's a quick way to satiate any pho cravings, especially on Sundays when most other pho places are closed. I normally order the beef brisket pho, which is about average. What I normally do not like is how lukewarm they serve the dish rather than hot as they're supposed to. Also, I always feel like the broth can be thicker and more authentic, though arguably they're erring on the safe side as not to scare away any newbies to pho. Finally, I wish they used more herbs to retain the pho-specific fragrance. Service at this particular location was solid. They were prompt and kind enough amidst the busy-ness.Ambience at the Pho chains is generally semi-hipster and modern. If you're looking for a traditional Vietnamese experience, I wouldn't recommend the Pho chains, but they're good for your casual pho meals.",

    "text": "I used to be a massive fan of Pho when it first opened. the bad news is that is slipping now just like the quality control.(esp in the takeaways) there used to be lots of fresh herb flavours \u00a0like mint and coriander. They seem to be skimping on these now. Can you up the price if that is the problem?the last pho I had, had been re heated and the noodles were hot (not lukewarm as they state). Several times I have had the wrong sauce given in my takeaway.service is great here as is the ambience.",

It was my first time having Vietnamese food and it was cooked to perfection and I also enjoyed a cup of Monkey King tea - very refreshing! The prawns were big and juicy and the service was great. We are thinking that next time we are up in London we will take our friends there for a treat.",
