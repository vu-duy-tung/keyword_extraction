    "text": "I was fortunate to stumble across Vapiano last weekend while returning from a fruitless visit to \"The Table\" nearby (it had closed by then). Vapiano is a German restaurant serving Italian food. It ranks somewhere between a fast food place and a proper sit down restaurant. There is no waiter service here. When you enter, you would be given an electronic card. There are a number of counters serving various food items ... Some for pizzas, some for pastas, some for the drinks and so on. The customer would have to walk up to the relevant counter and order the food there, watch it being prepared in front of him/her and then take it back to the table. While at the counter, you would have to touch the card to a sensor on the ordering machine which would then record the item that you would have bought. The card has to be presented at the cash counter on the way out, and paid for. Since this was my first visit here, I went for a somewhat conservative meal choice. I started with some roasted veal slices. It had quite a bit of meat, cooked pretty well. But it seemed somewhat dry to me. The accompanying sauce was great on its own, but it didn't add much to the dish in my opinion. As the main course, I tried the carbonara pasta (with penne). It came with bacon, onions and egg, and was served with Parmesan cheese. \u00a0I will admit that it was one of the best pastas that I have had in a very long time. The cream tasted very good. The sauce mixed very well with the pasta base and hence the taste appeared uniform throughout the dish. The fried bacons were excellent, but I am forced to say that I would have loved a vegetarian version too, something that most people who know me would find surprising. The prices weren't steep. A starter, a main course and a small glass of white wine set me back by about \u00a318. The service was quite quick and the ability to see the items being cooked was an additional bonus. I would love to eat here again.",

As others have posted, you get an electronic card to which you charge your food and drink, and then are left to roam, ordering food from counters, and hoping for somewhere to sit and eat it. Nobody explains the concept when you go in, you're expected to know how it works. Food perfectly reasonable and I had some nice red wine to go with it. One of my colleagues was taken very ill after eating the seafood though. Go for the experience, but don't expect a relaxed meal and dinner conversation. It's a production line, they want you in, fed, and out again as quickly as possible.",

Excellent food, freshly prepared in front of your eyes - and you choose most of the ingredients, spices and even the sort of pasta yourself (try the whole grain spaghetti!). And the pizzas have such a crunchy crust, you must love them.

    "text": "German fast-food concept restaurant Vapiano recently opened its second London branch on the vibrant South Bank near the Tate Modern, bringing a new way of doing lunch to the area. Vapiano's big difference is that instead of being presented with a bill at the end of your meal which you need to waste time calculating if there's several of you eating, you're given a card similar to an Oyster card when you enter, and each time you approach a counter to order, you tap the card on a machine and it adds the cost of the dish, and any drinks you order, and you just pay on the way out. The food is freshly cooked in front of you and you're in full control of what goes in and what stays out. The drawback is that you do have to queue at service counters to get your food, and then carry it back to your table. Because of this, there's no worry about leaving a service charge or a tip, but it can be annoying particularly if there are just two of you and one of you is left guarding the table at a busy period! The food is all very good, the pizzas are well made and the olives here are fantastic.",

It's a little confusing the first time you visit as they give you a credit size card to load what you ordered onto which you then pay off at the end, there are lots of stations you queue at for pizza or pasta and then you choose the type of pasta you want, what flavours you want and then if you want chilli and garlic added, cheese on top and free slices of ciabatta. Once you've been once it's really simple! They cook the pasta in front of you whilst you wait. It's pretty quick once you get to the front of the queue but means it's really fresh. Today I went for the campanelli pasta (why have penne or fusilli you often have at home when there's other shapes?!) with bolognese, extra garlic and chilli, cheese on top and bread on the side. My colleague went for the scampi e spinachi with fusilli pasta...which she always goes for as it's apparently very good!I've never had pizza here so not sure what it's like but I definitely recommend the pasta. It's very busy at lunch time and it's not 'fast food' but it's tasty, large portions and reasonable value for money. They also do take away and the boxes the pasta comes in to take out is brilliant for re-using (it's large and very sturdy to keep washing and re-using!).Do pay a visit if you're hungry and passing a Vapiano.",

I dont know, just seems right to me, I mean, it's 'A-ok'.",

Once you have picked your meal, you go up to one of the counters (different ones for salad, pizza and pasta) where your food is prepared right in front of you and you need to scan your payment card again. You will always have the choice of adding chili, cheese and pine kernels - delicious! When you are done, take your payment card to the checkout counter, so no need to catch a waiters' attention. Plus, there are always gummy bears at the checkout - nice little treat.

    "text": "This place surprised me.I've always held a dim view of franchise pasta restaurants: the food is almost always meh, charging exorbitant prices for boiled pieces of dough topped with non sequitur embellishments. Vapiano, actually, delivers yum.No one would argue that pasta is most delicious when prepared fresh but, on the other hand, I'm one to favor speed over quality: I don't wait for food, food waits for me (especially during lunch rush). No point banging on this - looks like freshness is a point of pride for the brand. Time wasted in queueing is what keeps me from visiting more often than I'd like.The cafeteria-esque format is attractive, as is the atmosphere and decor. The card based order tracking system is a pain in the ass.",

    "text": "Delicious food with exceptional efficiency. My favourite part is that when at the counter you can add whatever ingredients to your meal that is being prepared in front of you. It's free to add and makes the meal more filling for the same price. Non traditional Italian, the food lacks the classic Italian passion and it is obvious in the food. The service is non existent, you won't find that Italian warm welcome. However this modern twist makes it a great casual dining place, especially for groups since each can have their own card, removing the trouble of splitting the check.",

There are no waiters, instead you get given a card and every time you want something you go to a station and they swipe your card. When you go to leave present your card at the desk. Simples! We kicked off with a grande plate of antipasti of Proscuitto tipo Parma, salami, pepperoni, roasted vegetables, homemade pesto, Grana Padano D.O.P, buffalo mozzarella, bruschetta (\u00a310.95). Meat and cheese what's not to love?!They make their pasta fresh daily and they have a range of interesting specials. I chose the salssica con ficci \u00a39.95, sausage with fresh figs, as it sounded unusual. I thought the pasta had a nice bite to it but unfortunately the delicate sweetness of the fig was overwhelmed by the spicy sausage. It was still tasty though and you do get a giant portion!More of the spicy sausage showed up on the next course of pizza. I was starting to get very full at this point so just took a tiny nibble. I knew dolci would be coming and I wanted to save space!I was wise to do so because then ALL the desserts arrived. Before you worry for our arteries we shared these between us. My favourites were the pannacotta \u00a34.50 with a dramatic red top of coulis and the ciccholata foresta nera \u00a34.50, an Italian take on black forest gateau but made with Nutella, which I am bound to love as it is my favourite spread in the whole wide world (speculous runs it a close second). Be warned most of the desserts feature cream heavily so if you are with a non dairy lover pick carefully. Luckily our resident non dairy fan Alex was adept at tunnelling through the cream to get to the chocolate underneath!",

I actually remembered to take pictures this time and get around to reviewing it. This place is slightly confusing on entering. You get a credit card thrusted at you on entrance. Then you find multiple sections on pizza or pasta. Depending on what you want to order. You then aimlessly join one of the queues with the least folk in it, just to realise that's the slowest one!Pick your order, what pasta you want and any extras. Then it's freshly cooked for you. Simples as that!I went for a tomato pesto with pine nuts and chicken over linguine pasta. You get ciabatta bread thrown in for good measure. I had to wait around ten minutes, so this ain't no fly in and out lunch places. It is delicious though... But I always regret carbing it up like this at a lunchtime. I need an afternoon nap!!What does niggle me and why I won't give it five stars,.. it's disorganised chaos at \u00a0lunchtime. They really need to figure out a better method and implement it. That's why I don't make this my first choice for lunch. I simply don't have an hour to kill!Other times of day are okay and you really do need to try a pizza here. So light and crispy. Really darn tasty!!So all in all, waiting a while is its achilles heel, but if you have the time you won't regret it. You Gotta Eat Here - For Sure! :-D",

This would be less of an issue if the host/hostess explained the system upon arrival, but communication here is minimal. We were handed a card and basically left to our own devices, all the while wondering who would be taking our order. Eventually, we flagged down a staff member who explained the system to us, and at long last we were able to order some food. We got a pizza to share, which would have been great if the toppings weren't all set on one side of the pizza, and if we hadn't had practically to fight with the cook to get a second dish. All in all, not a fan of the concept, and it needs much better communication to actually work.",

My colleague and I had lunch there and she was so impressed by the efficiency of this operation, that she called it a great German success. (It's first location was in Hamburg, but funnily enough it was created by a group of US investors.)Anyways, in my opinion Vapiano is the epitome for combining fast food with relatively high quality food. The best way to explain it, is to explain how you order:Upon entering the restaurant, a hostess will hand out a card to you. Then you proceed to the various food stations: there's a station for salad, pizza, pasta & drinks. At each station you place your order and the cook will then prepare it right in front of you (except for the pizza, where they will hand you one of these buzzers that will tell you once your order is ready). The cook will also add the appropriate amount to your card and you may then proceed to one of the many tables. When you're done eating/drinking, you proceed to the check-out and pay what's been accumulated onto your card. Just to be clear: this is not a place for a romantic get-away, but it's a good place to go when you're hungry and want something reasonably healthy fast.",

Once we had our food we all met at a sturdy wooden farm table and ate together. Since everyone gets their own food here, there's no waiting for a server, or for a fellow diner who cannot decide. This is clutch when you're on the edge of hanger (hungry anger)!Vapiano is no culinary breakthrough but I've enjoyed every meal I've had here - from in London and Berlin to Munich and Washington, D.C.",

You won't feel heavy or greasy after leaving. A nice touch is that there are fresh basil plants all over the place ready to pick and put on your food. Water is free from jugs at the drinks counter (but again you need to get it yourself, as there is no service here, however nor is there a service charge...great right?)Anyways, remember that card they scanned? Well that has a record of what you ate, and you pay with this at the till on leaving. Note the delicious german gummi sweets on leaving and take as many as possible without receiving a raised eyebrow :)A fantastic experience.",

Expect to wait for 5-10 mins if a few people are ahead of you, again, they make everything fresh.The service is ok.

    "text": "As a general rule, I try to avoid Italian restaurants. There's nothing new there, it's difficult for a restaurant to do anything which is memorable and most of them are chain pizza or pasta venues. So when I was taken to Vapiano, I was very much skeptical that it would be any good.But my was I mistaken - on entering, the first thing I noticed were the indoor plants, high ceilings with lots of natural light coming in and large tables spaced generously apart. You're given a card onto which you charge all the food and drink you buy, which makes this place perfect for groups. And then there are all the chefs at each station, making the dishes right in front of you, with skill and ease.And the best bit - it tastes pretty great. I was hypnotised watching fresh pasta being made in a huge pasta-making machine, and then being stacked on a shelf ready to be cooked up. I opted for a spinach and scallops with tagliatelle, which was cooked and seasoned beautifully. Though the menu lacks imagination, what they do do, they seem to do well.The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and although they didn't serve Fanta, I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the experience, and for a chain restaurant, this was a good place to go out to. Also, jelly bears on your way out - oh yes.",

But the sauce I chose was made too thick and spaghetti was bit undercooked. Interesting concept of the restaurant but makes things inefficient IMO. Tho the chefs have mad skills to get one dish ready in 5mins, that means you still have to wait 20mins if there are 4 ppl in front of you. Compared to standing in line, I prefer to wait sitting at the table. Also I don't wanna queue in lines again only to get a dessert after queuing for pasta or pizza",

Sounds strange that I didn't just eat some stupid spaghetti, but whatever. On my lunch break I ran over to Vapiano and ordered their spelt spaghetti (they have multiple options of pasta, points!!!) with pomodoro sauce (hold the cheese, trying to be vegan)... and, it was probably the most delicious lunch I had eaten in months. Anyway, Vapiano is excellent. They make the food right in front of you, which is pretty badass, and they have a ton of options and will cater to your needs (no meat or cheese, no problemo!) There's plenty of seating at this location or you can take it to-go, like I did. Their bruschetta is also FANTASTIC! Be careful though, I'd never come at lunch time (12-2) because it's probs way too busy.",

    "text": "We were headed for a play at \"The Bunker\" nearby & the place we wanted to eat at did not take bookings and had a 45 min - 1hr waiting line outside, which was how we ended up at vapiano.I'd heard about vapiano, but I'd never visited before because their menu is very carb heavy and not something I would choose on purpose.As soon as you enter vapiano, you are given a card for each member in your group. There are then separate counters for salads, pizzas, pasta / risotto, dessert & appetisers.You stand in line for each of your orders. Pasta & risotto is made as you wait, the salad counter asks you to come back in awhile & the pizza guys give you a buzzer for when your pizza is ready. You swipe your card at each counter that you order at & then submit your card on exit where they total your bill for paying. It's cafeteria style, yet not really cafeteria style. The system works when you are alone & only want to pick up from one counter. You pick up your order before you settle down, but if you want things from multiple counters - a salad + a pizza it's a bit of a bother.The salads were good. We had a spinach + strawberry salad that was interesting & a carpaccio where I was surprised to see thinly sliced raw mushrooms on it. I was initially sceptical, but it did work.My husband was very happy with his seafood risotto. They had the rice precooked and toss it with whatever accompaniments & sauces you order, so it didn't take too long once ordered.The pizza wasn't bad, but not worth it for someone on a minimal carb diet.The dessert had Nutella & chocolate & vanilla cream, so it was obviously very good - with ingredients like that, you can't go wrong.I wouldn't enter vapiano on purpose since I try to keep white flour to a minimum & the only option left is the salads (which are cold) There's no hot meal option other than pasta or pizza. But if you like pasta, then this is a good place to go.",

On more than one occasion I've been given food that wasn't exactly what I've ordered and eaten it anyway. I'm not a fussy eater at all. I ordered a chicken alfredo with linguine pasta, something you'd think is so simple it couldn't possibly be bad. I had about three bites and couldn't finish it because I felt ill. How you could turn pasta into the texture of chewy glue is beyond my comprehension. I feel so brutally offended to have spent \u00a39.50 on food I couldn't even stomach that my evening has been completely ruined. They get 1 star because their strawberry bellini was actually quite lovely but that's about the only good thing I can think of for this restaurant.

Jamie W. and I passed by this contemporary-looking place which seemed to me like an appropriate dining option close to the Tate Modern (photo: bit.ly/1jPnYbJ). It's right across the street from the citizenM Bankside where we were staying. And yes, that's part of a chain, too. So I was willing to overlook the commercial aspect of the venture and let ourselves be served. But wait, we need a \"chip\" card to order? Is this an ATM now? Is this the return of the Horn & Hardart Automat? No, we're told to go to the various food stations to order our food thus cutting out the need for a waitstaff (photo: bit.ly/RzCdGY). Really? But she worked hard for the money, so hard for it, honey.So it's sort of like a cafeteria but fancier. Why am I not surprised this is a concept based in Germany? No personal warmth, just efficiency, Mein Herr. Jamie and I both went to the pasta station since we weren't quite in the mood for pizza. You get your choice of noodle, so he went for his perennial choice, Pappardelle with Bolognese Sauce for \u00a3 7.95 (photo: bit.ly/1iE3eir). I went for Pappardelle too but with Salsiccia con Ficci (Italian sausage with figs) for \u00a3 9.95. Both were hearty portions and surprisingly tasty given the production-line approach taken here. We also split a \u00a3 6.50 Insalata Cesare (Caesar salad to all you non-cosmopolitan types who love their chains). It was fine, fairly generic but fresh (photo: bit.ly/1l7XM95). Locals appear to like it, so why should this curmudgeonly tourist spoil their fun?FOOD - 3 stars...pretty good considering how the assembly line doesn't give much room for culinary flairAMBIANCE - 4 stars...spacious communal tables and an upscale modern veneerSERVICE - 3 stars...a bit on automatic pilot since they expect you to know the routineTOTAL - 3 stars...I'm just a link in a chain but I still had a solid, rib-sticking pasta meal",

    "text": "I seriously love this place in Southbank London.Fresh pasta dishes prepared in front of you - proper Italian style pizzas.Some might find the dining style to be odd. You have to carry around these cards where the chefs preparing your food add the totals to your account - and then you close out and pay upon exit. I don't mind it except your party will need to secure a table or dining area and send party members up to the chef \u00a0queues \u00a0to order the food - otherwise your group might be carrying around trays of food with nowhere to sit.The format and quality of the food for the value tho is outstanding. I only don't give 5 stars because the cocktails are lacking. If you want beer or wine fine - but order a cocktail and get ready to drink something a bit below what you would find at a mall restaurant bar.",

    "text": "This is a gem! Firstly, the concept of Vapiano is quite different from any restaurant. It's a self service restaurant. You are handed an empty card when you walk in and you have to find a seat. Then you walk over to one of their stations and give your order, watch the chef prepare your food in front of you, collect it and swipe the card so that your dish is registered. At the end, you give in your card at the counter and make the payment you've racked up.It's definitely an amazing idea. I like that we can watch the chefs at work which also means you can personalise your dish more easily (don't go crazy). It also means your food comes a lot quicker which anyone can appreciate. Sure, you have to be on your feet for a bit but it's all part of the experience! The food itself is executed with perfection. I always go for the crema di fungi which is creamy pasta with different sorts of mushrooms. The cream is rich but not so much so that its sickly and the pasta is always cooked just right. I've also heard great things about the gamberetti which is pasta with king prawns and tomato sauce. Now the clincher: you get free bread. There is a great selection of dips that goes with the bread and it ties your meal in together nicely. There are also little pots of basil around which you can tear off and put into your dish which is a quirky touch. As for the atmosphere, it's buzzing. It's always filled with a slightly younger crowd and large groups of students. So yes, it does get very crowded in the evenings and there was once we had to wander around for 40 minutes to find a seat. The waiters do chip in and help you out if they see you lost but they probably need a few more for it to be efficient. Regardless, it's still a personal favourite on my list of restaurants. Top range Italian food for average prices.",

    "text": "Fast fresh Italian food, yes. I should not like this, as we all know my feelings on restaurant chains, but to be fair, you cannot beat someone taking the ingredients you choose and cooking them in front of you. It is a theatre to watch and satisfying to taste. It is a weird feeling entering an establishment, being given a card to wonder around on your own to discover what you want. It's kinda self service but not. You have the pizza area and what seems to be the salad area. Then there is the pasta and risotto section where you choose your pasta type (or risotto), ingredients and sauce. This is genius. Sorry but it is. Not sure how qualified these Chefs are, but this is the third time I have been here and each time I have been in awe of their ability to cook up a pasta delight. Sometimes even doing two orders at a time. They ooze confidence and it shows in the finished product. During my most recent visit, Eleanor started with the bruschetta duo (roasted ciabatta bread, basil pesto, tomato and grana padano) and also a salad of Chicken, croutons, romaine and grana padano D.O.P. I went straight in on the carbs with pasta, king prawn, basil pesto, cherry tomato, spinach, onions and cream sauce. For main course, Eleanor went with chicken salad. So you order what you want and you swipe your card for it to record it. You can also go to the bar area to order drinks. I am not sure how the other venues are, but the one at Bankside is very organised. Each time I have been here, I have found a clean spot to chillax and eat. There is a large eating area just outside on Southwark Street, so in the summer months, you can take advantage of the rays. I like this spot. It is good spot for a quick lunch or dinner. Of course, if you want the best authentic Italian experience, there are places which you have to go. That said, Vapiano is a good contender as long as they stay true to the fresh ingredients and professional prep I have had the pleasure of enjoying on the last three occasions.",

    "text": "Vapianos is one of my favourite regular haunts. The food's reasonably priced and prepared speedily; watching the chef prepare your dinner and alter it to your specifications never gets old; I like the relaxed sit-anywhere approach; and the paycard system is a great fix for debating how to split the bill when you go out with a group.The being said, this visit didn't get off to the best of starts as it took me a few attempts to get the message across about wanting crayfish swapped out of my risotto for chicken. Once that hitch was fixed, though, my food was soon ready. Has to be the best risotto I've eaten too, or at least up there: white wine risotto with chicken, white asparagus and onion. Not the kind of place I'd go for a special occasion, but great for relaxed comfort food.",

You can choose one of the recipes on offer, customise it with additional ingredients or taking some out and can customise with whatever pasta you want, all freshly prepared right in front of you.Affordable, packed full of flavour and friendly service with a smile makes Vapianos a place to try if in the area.",
