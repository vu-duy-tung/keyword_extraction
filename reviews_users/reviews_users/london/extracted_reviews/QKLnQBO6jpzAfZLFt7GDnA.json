    "text": "This restaurant, and hotel for that matter exist because of the views. \u00a0Not the food or service. \u00a0 my first day here I had the afternoon tea of which I chose the \"Asian style\" over traditional. \u00a0Once I was seated a waiter placed an empty water glass in front of me. \u00a0And then for 20 minutes I waited. \u00a0Once the waiter came back - and believe me, there are plenty of staff, I ordered my tea and a peach Bellini. \u00a0 I got the afternoon. tea that had a weird taste of burgomont. \u00a0The bellini was absolutely the worst I have EVER had. \u00a0I was starting to wonder if it were lychee or something. \u00a0When the tiered trays of food came, the scones were missing. \u00a0I waited 15,minutes for them to come out. \u00a0 The savory selection. were mainly dim sum. \u00a0Cold, bland, dim sum. \u00a0I started to question. myself if I was at the correct hotel. \u00a0Once the scones came. \u00a0 I finished two and was out of clotted cream and jam. \u00a0 I had to ask TWICE to get more. \u00a0I had to ASK to get more water. \u00a0My glass sat empty for over 30,minutes. \u00a0I had to ASK for more tea (I switched to the breakfast tea which was much better). \u00a0The only thing I didn't have to ask for was the second serving of cold, bland dim sum. \u00a0This was the MOST expensive tea service I've ever had. 54 GBP and 6 GBP service charge. \u00a0 In American dollars that is around $100. \u00a0 OUTRAGEOUS. \u00a0I'm writing this during breakfast at Ting where no one has asked me if I want more tea, nor have they removed the finished plate sitting in front of me, nor have they refilled the empty orange juice glass. \u00a0In fact NO ONE has even come by to ask me if I needed anything else!The staff at breakfast is the same as at the afternoon tea. \u00a0Running around like they dont know what to do and doing a damn fine job of ignoring the guests. At least my breakfast was included in the astronomical room rate I paid for this zoo of a disorganized hotel.",

    "text": "We booked in advance of our London stay. We wanted the view and the ambiance that thisrestaurant was supposed to have. We arrived for a late lunch. No problems getting seatedbut it took awhile for the menus to arrive.The appetizers were ok but can you imagine serving Fois Gras with San Francisco sour doughbread?! The same bread for a very good fish tartar. The entrees- a risotto and an ocean trout were delicious. Much better than the service -we had a chilled bottle of wine that was kept in a cooler out of my reach- I had to ask THREE times for more wine, 2 times for more \u00a0water. For desert my wife had a cheese course--mystery ones since our server did not identify them- probably just as well since they were old, not at room temp and reaked of ammonia - served with extra \u00a0thin \u00a0flour poppadoms. My chocolate 3 ways had no taste even of chocolate. also we asked for bread with the cold Nh3 like cheeses and received --guesswhat? - more SF sour dough. I recommend going up to the restaurant level for the view-maybe a drink and have good meal elsewhereNo freebies or palate cleansers were served at our tableAlso the wait staff seemed to congregate away from all the patrons",

The views are incredible, the service is amazing and it has the best food of any tea house I have ever attended! Spontaneously, we approached the restaurant and asked if they could accommodate us, which we didn't expect them to. \u00a0However, they asked us to wait about 10 minutes and was able to seat us! While waiting in Ting's very busy lobby, we had a perfect view of the Thames River and enjoyed our ten minutes wait as we walked all over enjoying the views of the entirety of London. The interior was incredibly modern with glass and chrome. Upon being seated, the service was classic! The highlight of course was the tea itself. Though they had a good selection of Teas, the pastries were amazing! We've been to tea houses all over the world and I have to say that the food here is the best tasting I've ever had! Every macaroon, every finger sandwich, every pastry was incredibly fresh and felt like it just came out of the oven. \u00a0The price was \u00a360 per person but the views and the food made every penny worth it! \u00a0We did not visit the observation Tower because we did not feel the need, after having such a wonderful view during our dining experience. \u00a0 I look forward to our next visitation and will savor the memories until then. \u00a0Bravo Tings, Bravo!!!!",

Also, even though they suggest a 2 hour limit, you're not rushed in any way. We wanted to try as much as possible from Ting so we opted for the the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings. The wine selection was perfect, enhancing the flavours of the meal and vice versa... But I think that's the only reason I really enjoyed the meal for the price. Spending around \u00a3225, I wanted my socks to be knocked off by more than just the view and (most of) the wine. Do yourselves a favour and order what you know you'll like, rather than this option.",

    "text": "Ok, this is a tough one.I was taken here for my birthday on a Wednesday lunchtime. We specifically requested a window seat and said it was for a birthday, with quite some notice. When we arrived, as splendid as the view was, we weren't near the window, and I was disappointed to note that we were pretty much the only people not to be, so it did feel like a snub. Entrance through the Shangri'La hotel is impressive, it's a truly opulent location and it felt quite exciting. Ting itself is beautiful with gorgeous furniture, rugs and even velvet menus. However, some sort of event was being set up just next to the seating area and there was loud banging and talking throughout the day. There were a LOT of staff, and they seemed attentive. Unfortunately this did not translate to a good service.We ordered one of each of the afternoon teas, so we could sample the full range of food on offer, both classic and eastern. We upgraded to the champagne, which was delicious, and when the food came it looked very impressive. We soon realised though that it must have been sat out for quite a while. All the sandwiches were very dry and not particularly tasty. I ordered extra sandwiches and these took a while to come and were also dry, so I assume the kitchen must make them in advance. The scones and cakes were mostly delicious though and beautiful looking, so I can't really fault those.The tea was the real problem. The first (small) pot took a while to come, well after the food had arrived. The second pot took over half an hour and I asked four separate members of staff to check on it, all were very apologetic but it still didn't materialise. We spent the majority of the afternoon tea thirsty and irritated. I still have absolutely no idea how so many members of staff couldn't work out how to pour hot water into a teapot!In conclusion, if you want a amazing view, go to the view from the Shard or Sky Garden. If you want an amazing afternoon tea with incredible service go to Tartufo at 11 Cadogen Gardens. If you want to go somewhere just because it's posh, go to the Ritz. Sorted. Otherwise you could just go to Ting and spend a ridiculous amount of money, up to you.",

    "text": "A beautiful all-day restaurant in the Shangri-la hotel on the 35th floor of the Shard. 'Ting' apparently comes from the Chinese for 'living room', and indeed this place looks straight off the pages of a glamorous interiors magazine. There's large thick rugs over smooth wooden floors with all the furniture in muted neutral tones of pale pinks, golds and beiges that made it feel a little like we'd arrived at a spa.We were led round to our table next to the east-facing windows, which gave us a stunning view over Tower Bridge and towards Canary Wharf. Arriving at 6.30pm and leaving a few hours later was perfect to watch the day-to-night transition and sunset sky colours. Our seating was on plush sofas that looked more suited to an afternoon tea than dinner but I suppose it works if you're serving food all day.The gorgeous setting is, as expected, reflected in the prices. Luckily I was being treated this evening! Not that we wanted to bankrupt our generous sponsor though, so we decided to go for the 4-course set menu for \u00a355pp, which meant we got to try more dishes and worked out cheaper than getting 3 courses from the a la carte menu. There's a good selection of British dishes available, most with some kind of Asian twist. You could also get matching wines for an extra \u00a335pp but it looked as though that was for 2 small glasses plus a dessert wine which we didn't think seemed worth it. The sommelier superbly helped us choose a chardonnay instead, listening to what we wanted and actually recommending one of the cheaper bottles (around the \u00a350 mark) rather than the usual move of guilting you into the pricier ones.The food was beautifully presented so firmly ticked the first-bite-is-with-the-eye box. It tasted delicious too - I would only highlight that the portion sizes were quite small. It was fine for me, but I know a lot of guys who wouldn't have been full (and perhaps I'd feel differently if I'd paid!). The starter of Portland Crab was light and fresh, with flavours of mango, passionfruit and ponzu decorating the plate. The second course of salmon had two fairly small strips of cured salmon among slivers of apple and beetroot. For main two of us went for the duck which was nicely tender and served both breast and leg, whilst my other colleague chose the plaice which appeared covered in some kind of foam but she seemed to like it. Dessert looked particularly arty on the plate and disappeared quickly - rhubarb pieces with other components of white choc and basil flavours. Petit fours followed with coffee which is always a nice touch to round things off.Service was on top form throughout - attentive and unobtrusive. I liked that the tables were quite spread out compared to some of the other Shard spots I've tried where you're crammed in more closely - it gives a nice feeling of privacy with space. It was also nice to see a focus on locally and ethically sourced ingredients in the menu, with our set 4-courses being called the 'Rooted in Nature' menu. All of this and the lovely atmosphere it created served to outweigh their slightly strange behaviour when booking, as they told my colleague they were fully booked in the evening and we could only have a 6-8pm sitting. However we were the first ones in the place to arrive for dinner and it remained largely empty for the next hour. The window tables began to fill up from 7ish but it was still far from 'full'. As such they didn't get rid of us at 8 as they'd said they would and we lingered until past 9. Not sure why they forced us to start so early!A final note on the wonderfully hi-tech toilets that I'd guess have been ordered from Japan. Press every button for the fun of it (I did) and enjoy the unique sensation of sitting on a pre-heated toilet seat. Lush hand cream too :)",

Before they give you the menu they offer you a glass of Champagne. Not good. The afternoon tea has two different prizes one with champagne one without. Well after we got the 1st glass of champagne they mentioned second one is extra charge. Not cool. Yet they mentioned we can have as many different types of tea we want. As well that they will bring sandwiches and scone as much as we want.We ordered the type of tea we wanted, but got it after 1hr 10minutes ...they forgot!! We had to ask for it again. \u00a0They tried to compensate that with a glass of champagne. Which was a good gesture but at this point I was very disappointed.They were not apologetic. We're there for two hours they didn't check on us. After we asked for our tea we got a second plate of sandwiches. But we ordered a classic and Asian so we should have gotten a plate of the classic and a plate of Asian plate. Well I didn't want to make a scene in this high establishment we are the only blacks very very upset. When everyone left they got a small box of treats We didn't get that either.",

Scones are not in the traditional baking way, which is fine but still very mediocre. I like the Yuzu Cheesecake as their signature dish but the rest of the sweets plates are in a poor standard.

    "text": "We went to Ting for my birthday celebration with my family. We booked lunch in December way in advance, which I imagine was essential, given that the restaurant was busy.I would split my rating of Ting in two. As an experience, it was a delight. The decor was beautiful, everywhere was extremely polished and clean, the staff were extremely courteous and of course the views were stunning. In this area, Ting gets a five-point-five out of five, certainly compared to going for lunch at a more conventional venue.The food and drink though; this was less clear cut for me. We had the Christmas set menu which was a very delicately composed and original take on festive flavours such as Turkey, cranberry, squash and stuffing. If I'm honest I chose this in the interests of not bankrupting those who were paying for the meal. And it was... pretty good, I suppose. I think that was the problem. It didn't wow me and I was left feeling that it didn't really marry up with the rest of the fantastic experience. A 'B' when everything else was an 'A', type-thing... it just lacked something for me slightly, somehow. \u00a310 for a green tea was humorously steep, too. But maybe I'd be writing differently if we had gone for the standard menu.Overall I would recommend this place, although if I could I would give it 3.5 stars. Unless you're going all out on the \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3, I'd expect to get more out of the total experience than the restaurant itself.",

    "text": "We went on vacation to London for the first time and were so excited for afternoon tea at Ting's. the Shard is beautiful and we were greeted promptly and our table was ready. At first we had our first waiter, I believe his name was Evan. We was amazing. Very attentive, gave recommendations, and was super nice. But then.... he tells us his shift is over. And another guy will be serving us. It was all over then. The other guy, I think his name was Florence, never came to greet us. He never asked if we wanted more of our food, or more hot water or take our plates away, or anything. We had purchased sparkling water that our original waiter had to put the side to save space. And we never saw it again. My mouth was parched with nothing to drink and he still never came by. I think he was purposely avoiding eye contact with me bc I even waved at him. Sigh. What a deflated experience. We know it could have been much different but we ended up paying $60+ a person for bad service. I would say beware if you ever get a waiter named Florence. Ask for someone else.",

From a couple of dull hostesses without many people skills or personality \u00a0to a unintensive waiter we left. Second time I have ever done that at a restaurant in my life. Not all lost as we got to enjoy the views of London for the 20 minutes we sat and were ignored. I gave one star as I didn't have the option on giving no stars. Very disappointed but had a great meal at Gaucho Tower Bridge instead. So all ends well.",

The peas and foiegras was superb, but the 'piglet' was slightly let down, too much fat. They sting you on the drinks, cheapest glass of wine is about \u00a314. Again, it's what you expect. Nothing out of this world, but the views alone are why i'm giving it 4 stars.",

And I was surprised that you can order as much as you want, it seemed like an endless servings of delicious plates. The scones were to die for.

In my opinion, the only plus about this place is the fact that it's situated very high up in the Shard so you get a view of the city.The service here was terrible, and we waited forever to order. The waiters were all very hard to get a hold of and never really checked up on us. Considering how expensive the restaurant is, the service was really lacking. We mostly ordered off the Shangri-La Wellness Menu which had a lot of dairy and gluten free alternatives. The Grilled Organic Chicken Breast was very flavorless and dry. The salad and grilled veggies weren't that great either. Nothing about this place was very memorable and I wouldn't recommend it.",

The views on the 35th floor are amazing and the ambiance is very classy. It doesn't get loud and it's pretty quiet, which is very nice. I felt relaxed the whole time I was there. The plush sofas and chairs are really comfortable and goes well with the elegant decor. We all decided to get a glass of Rose Champagne with our tea for seventy pounds a person. Yes, it is on the pricey side, but it was definitely worth it! You also get unlimited teas and sandwiches. I was a bit hesitant with their sandwiches and sweets, but boy did they prove me wrong. Every single sandwich, scone, and sweets were delicious. The jam was the best jam I've ever had. The Rose was light and went well with our teas. I stuck with the English Afternoon Blend and had about 6-7 cups. The aroma and earthy flavor was so addicting. I also needed an extra caffeine boost after feeling tired from the glass of Rose. The service was also superb. Our server and the whole staff were very attentive and kind. I also love the calamansi they gave us to clean our pallets before serving us our teas and champagne. It was refreshing and unique. Our experience here was nothing, but impeccable. They also change the theme every season. I wish I lived in London, I would definitely be coming here more often!",

While the place is relatively new (compared to other High Tea locations), it felt a bit shabby. The menus were tattered, the service mediocre and the food not memorable. They have a great opportunity to be unique as they offer an Asian inspired menu as well as the Traditional fare of tiny sandwiches and scones. However the food from both menus was bland and unimaginative. There were some interesting presentations and the tea selection was good, but I'm sure there are better places to have High Tea for the prices we paid. You do however get a fantastic view of the Thames and the Tower Bridge. Maybe that's what you're paying for.",

Great views but the food took a long time to arrive, service was poor given there seems to be a number of staff but just not attentive and not really trained as they forget simple things like condiments and not taking an order until we had to walk around to find someone. Food itself was fine but not worth the wait or the money and bland without any spice. I would stick to just having a drink and enjoy the view to be honest. Shame really as the place really could be special.",

    "text": "Ting Lounge is another high rise restaurant in London, situated on the 34th floor of the Shard as part of the Shangri La Hotel. This time we were here for their afternoon tea.Given its prestigious location and it's fancy decor they could have improved vastly on their service and quality of food. There was only two staff present meaning service was slow and forgetful. We had to ask several times for our food and tea to be refilled yet sadly even to the end, my parent's tea never got refilled. Would have helped if they wrote the order down on paper.However the price somewhat made up for the lack of efficiency and we were later told after being seated that the price of \u00a354 for an afternoon tea was actually between two people so essentially it's only \u00a327 for one person which isn't bad compared to other afternoon teas. The platters and tea also had unlimited refills. It was a spacious area, beautifully dressed tables and chairs with gold tassels. With floor to ceiling windows you cannot miss the fantastic views of London. You could hear the live pianist playing from the floor above too.Between eight of us we ordered two Asian inspired afternoon tea and two English afternoon tea to share. As we waited we also made an order of tea from their menu which had a nice varied selection of the classics and the more uncommon ones. However when the tea arrived, more than half were luke warm, mainly the more classic varieties as if they have been made beforehand and just sitting in a jug. A disappointing start already.Asian inspired afternoon teaSavouries consisted mainly of generic Asian starters. The vegetable rice paper roll and mango chutney was one of the poorest additions I've had. It was so bland I felt like I was eating paper. There was no seasoning other than the generic mango chutney you get from a bottle. The rice paper itself was hard and dry as if it had been made hours beforehand and sitting there to dry out. Siew mai with tobiko tasted pre bought and microwaved, lacking sweetness and complexity. There was no bounce or any textural differences to distinguish between the filling, only the addition of the fish roes on top that provided some spark to it. Deep-fried gyoza with spicy mayo. No attempt to be creative. It was barely filled or had any taste from the promised vegetable filing, mainly masked by the hard exterior pastry outside. \u00a0Again all very one noted, only the spicy fermented broad bean mayonnaise on top that gave it flavour. The only promising dish out of the savouries was the beef sandwich. The beef slice was suprising full of flavour being marinated in ginger and soy beforehand with sweet notes. It was nice and tender and matched well the soft fluffy white bread.English afternoon teaSo on the lower tier of the stand contained the platter of sandwiches. Stilton blue cheese, caramelised walnuts, cucumber \u00a0lacked balance, being much stronger in the cheese masking most of the caramelised walnuts. As much as people may enjoy blue cheese, a lot of people don't so it is a risky sandwich filling to have. Egg and mayo could have been more generous with filling as I tasted more of the bread than the filling itself. The bread also drew out a lot the moisture making it very dry. \u00a0Smoked salmon was okay but I definitely had better, lacking that richness and oiliness a good slice of smoked salmon should have.Roasted organic chicken, jam\u00f3n Serano, tomato in a brioche roll- The brioche bun, tasted like it dried out and the jamon was too hard and tough. Luckily the chicken itself was juicy enough and sweet to give it at least some moisture and decent flavour. Tea Poached Prawn, lemon mayonnaise, baby gem was okay. Nice herby mousse, full of flavour and creamy. Sadly the pastry was too dry and hard and breaking away that soft texture. On both the Asian and English afternoon tea, the scones were probably the highlight. Both lovely, fresh buttery and fluffy. On the Asian, it consisted of Oolong scones and on the English, Camomile scones for a more unique touch. They were all very good. The accompanied jams were also delicious and moreish especially the mango jam which was deliciously fruity and sweet.Desserts were pretty good, most of them being quite creative and all freshly made. Sadly I don't remember every individual piece apart from the macaroons that was the only real disappointment. Don't think \u00a0I've had one that was so dry and brittle.Although the price is better than paying to see the Shard alone, I still feel quite let down my Ting. As nice as the atmosphere was our meal was poorly executed with missing orders. Quality of the savouries were also poor. But I wouldn't dismiss this place completely. It was nice that even those who order an English menu could have their next refills exchanged with an Asian & visa versa. Price and the sweet dishes weren't bad either. They even gave us doggy bags to take away the food we couldn't finish. Just don't come with high expectations",
