    "text": "My first meal in London was at Piccolino, and I still smile just thinking about it.I had checked into my hotel, showered the 8 hour flight off of me, and set out to explore and eat. I stumbled upon all the restaurants on Heddon Street and decided on Piccolino because their patio was open. The idea of sitting outside in December made this Chicago gal GIDDY.I was seated next to one of the patio heaters, and between that and the delicious prosecco I was very warm and happy. I ordered a margherita pizza and DAMN...I swear, just being closer to Italy makes everything better. It was hands down one of the best pizzas I've ever had in my life.As I sat on the patio, drinking delicious bubbly and eating delicious food, I was kind of taking it all in and the woman at the next table leaned over and said, \"this is the life, isn't it?\"It is. It really, really is.",

So we said the next place that serves food boom lets do it up.So we turn on to Heddon Street, and there is a world of little, yet big restaurants. We sit on the patio in the first place waiting 10minutes I even asked for menus, but hunger is becoming me and I would have ripped someones head off if i didnt eat soo. So we head over to Piccolino, boom service straight away. Brought to our seat in the large busy patio surrounded by groups of friends and people in suits. So it was a mixed place, very relaxing from the street its juts off, Regents St. We ordered some wine and a pizza. The waiter was a very nice, but he seemed cautious not to talk or converse with his customers as there was 3managers ourside, from what it looked like. He was our age and would have been handy if we could have talked to him about places to go and eat etc. But he was an extremely good waiter just wished we could have talked to him a but moreThe Chenin Blanc, Paarl Heights.... GET it... YUM YUM!!!!!!our pizza was huge enough for both of us... and the base was so thin ab perfect.",

    "text": "Piccolino has a wonderful location, just off Regent's Street in a very charming little street and lots of outdoor seating. I imagine this place would be wonderful for sipping ice-cold drinks and relaxing the summer sun (that is, when there is sun in London.)I came here last week with some friends and I cannot say I was too impressed with the food despite my friends raving about how good it was, and how they always went to the one in Bristol. I had the arrabiata with spicy Italian sausage, and the only word I can use to describe the food is greasy, It was so oily I could see a visible rim around the place, the sauce was thick and lumpy, and I can make better at home, which is not why I pay for someone else to make a meal for me. Not impressed at all.That said, the poached egg and asparagus starter that two of the party had, looked amazing. But it did not live up to its hyped-up review by some of the others. The only reason I'd come back, is for the on-the-street seating. It seems like it could have a lovely ambiance. Shame about the food.",

It's not getting 5 stars purely because that's reserved for a select few including Da Mario on Gloucester Road and Pizzeria on the Green in Clapham, but it's still a great place, centrally located with good food and a good atmosphere. Best enjoyed on a warm summer evening in the outside seated area, before all the hen parties arrive at Strawberry Moons next door.",

Mozzarella tomato salad. Calamari was delicious and really tender but kind of small. It's ALL good here!!!",

That said, one of our group sent his steak back because it was too well done and they didn't make a fuss about it and brought a fresh one. The tap water request, however, was greeted with a huff. My prawn linguine thing was quite nice and the wine was good enough, but it's the kind of place I'd go if I was in the area and needed refuelling rather than making a beeline for it.",

    "text": "Saturday night, central London, sensible budget, left it too late to book the recommended Clos Maggiore. We ended up at Piccolino, on Heddon Street, but I wasn't too worried as had spotted some nice sounding dishes on the menu and I was dining with some of my favourite people. What happened next? We arrived for an early dinner (6pm) to a pretty empty restaurant. Maybe the fact that we asked to be moved away from the rain soaked / wind tunnel double doors to one of the myriad other tables gave us a black mark from the start, because from that moment on the waiting staff practiced the fine art of eye avoidance. Those who know me well would not say I'm known for my patience, and I have to admit I am a stickler for good service, but on this occasion I feel I hardly need to say a word about the badly seasoned, over-facingly large sausage & fennel risotto, or the strange bread holding racks which blocked cross table conversation, because the terrible service defined the restaurant in my mind. I'm being harsh, my friend loved her Spaghetti alla Vongole and the wine was nice. But the fact that it took us three hours to have bread, one course and a coffee, is pretty mystifying, no? Not much more to say, I loved the company, but wished we'd been able to try the Clos Maggiore! Food: 5/10Value for Money: 6/10Service: 2/10 Would I go again? Not on your nelly! bit.ly/azWohJ",

The service was average, our waitress was kind of bored but a bit arrogant looking and the food was very average. We had a steak to be recooked as the first one was not done to our liking. The second one was not better but we did not want to give it back another time. The other meal was ok - very much seasoned and to salty and oily in my opinion. In the end we were much disappointed as the money we paid for the two courses was not worth it regarding the quality we got. We would have done cheaper and better in a Strada or similar.",

Little touches make this place stand out, such as jackets being checked-in when you arrive, to the wine cooler which is brought to stand next to the table when a bottle is ordered, making you feel as if you are somewhere altogether more expensive than the menu would suggest. Furthermore, the kitchen itself is exposed to the restaurant rather than being hidden away, so you can see the food actually being prepared.",

Worse still is neither of us likes olives so that was a waste. They need to change the policy on this as it is misleading.We had the Rav Asparagi (Large) and Pollo Milanese, you can have some dishes either as small of large but again the option was not given when we ordered so there is some staff training to be done.Service was still good and food arrived promptly and arrived hot. I think the Pollo Milanese was a little too hot to start. Food tasted great and even the bread selection to start was different and a nice touch (just should be open about there being a charge). There was a nice seasoning to the chicken breast and coating was just right. Really enjoyed it. Portion was great and large for Lunch.Decor is not bad and large area inside and out. I think there is also a bar downstairs so will take a look and report next time.Given the restaurant inside was almost empty it was a little noisy. You could have a conversation but i think when it gets busy this may be a little more difficult.The menu is vast so many options from pasta and pizza to choose from and many dishes for vegetarians which is also another plus.With the membership card giving \u00a320 credit for the next visit and a loyalty scheme to not just this but there other restaurants i think this is a great idea and will visit again for sure.Total bill came in at around \u00a355.00 for two which is without starters or desserts or wine. But i think that is reasonable.Definitely worth a visit especially if you want a late lunch and skip dinner or need something to last you to late night dinner.",

    "text": "Piccolino is an interesting one. Located just off Regent Street on a more quite lane; it's a restaurant that looks quite elegant/posh from the outside, but surprisingly friendly in it's pricing point. While I'm not saying it's like dirt cheap; the ~\u00a313-15 price point for a pasta dish is not unreasonable in this side of town. Yes it is on the pricy end if you just wanted to fill your stomach; but the alternative around this area is really just Pret or sandwiches of other sorts. Service was great; the complimentary bread is always a plus! Pasta was really tasty (probably cause we were quite hungry at that point), and portion is not overly lacking. If i have to give it a fair assessment, i think it's more a \u00a310-12 dish, but i suppose you have to pay for the location and the 'complimentary' bread. meh~ All In all, I enjoyed the meal.",

Tasted more like rosemary. The butternut squash ravioli was pretty bland. I had to add salt because it was so flavorless. My boyfriend ordered the carbonara and it was also pretty mediocre. I feel like the pizzas might be better here, but all the dishes I've tried was not worth remembering. This place would probably be a good spot with a big group of friends as it has ample seating and nice vibes, but for date night, the food severely underwhelmed.",

While we waited we are some more of their delicious bread, the also sat us at a table right next to it al l(I wanted to to sneak some out when I left). The beef arrived presented on a board with two cups of roasted potatoes and a small jug of gravy, we were also given a plate of mixed greens to go with it. The meat was delicious cut into big slices and not and more on the rarer side (so you may want to ask if you prefer it more well done).I would definitely go back for the food, the drinks are a bit more on the pricey side but the service is great. They even have an outdoor area for when it's warmer (although there were heaters).",

Took a long time to bring our drinks and we were not offered any water which made getting through the rather salty food more of a Herculean task than one would have expected.It's a shame that the service and food let down the great location of the retardant. Hopefully this was a one-off but I'm sceptical about that.Maybe try another restaurant in the court, and if you fancy Italian, head over to Strada next door.Enjoy.",

I didn't realize this until after our stay but it's been recently renovated.We took a bit of time deciding what to order and the staff were very nice about it. I had a great glass of wine and we enjoyed the free bread, which was very good.We split a starter of calamari which was probably some of the best we've had (and we order it regularly), so that was a great start to the meal. For seconds, I had veal escaloppe which were wonderful and a very large portion! It was definitely salty, which may not appeal to all, but I loved it! My partner had the frutti di mare risotto which, although the seafood was good, the risotto itself was a bit bland.As both portions were generous, we only had a glass of dessert wine to cap off the night although the desserts did sound tempting.After our stay, I received a survey (we booked online) and I mentioned the bland risotto. I got a nice email back from the manager apologizing and saying they will take that on board.I would definitely go back here and in fact I'm planning a visit when my parents are next in town!",
