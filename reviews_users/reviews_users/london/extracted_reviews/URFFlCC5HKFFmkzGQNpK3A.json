I thought that the food was relatively bland, not bad but not great either. I loved the coconut rice though. The negatives: The place was really hot, (and it was cold outside) I was lucky that I had on a black t-shirt because I had to take off my coat and sweater just to get some comfort and had to walk outside every 10 minutes or so, to get some fresh air. We ordered fresh lemonade with the meal and they brought us some watered down Sprite or some other canned soft drink. Lastly, they brought us the wrong check, charging us 3 times what our bill was. we told the waiter and he was nice enough but he kept screwing it up and had to give us 4 receipts because he kept making mistakes.",

Whereas I'm not usually keen on chain restaurants, Thai food is a bit different as the food (especially the stir-frys) need to be freshly prepared. And the food here was lovely. Not taking into account the starters (the usual deep fried mix - tasty nonetheless), I had the chilli & basil with chicken stir fry (not sure of the Thai name) which was amazing. My girlfriend had the seafood stir fry, and that too got top marks. Along with a couple of Singhas on the side, the whole meal was really enjoyable and good value. The staff were really friendly, and managed to fit us in despite not having booked a table, and the layout is just right - they make it seem really spacious despite there being lots of tables.

    "text": "We were in a hurry to find a restaurant prior to attending to another event and didn't realize Thai Square was a chain because at the time there were two separate entries for this location on Yelp. One was called Thai Sqaure and the other Thai Square. The entry we looked at had 4.5 stars. Although I don't generally have problems with chains in the UK (Nando's is one of my favourite chains in the world), we have noticed that most chains in the UK don't do Asian food well. We should have known better regardless though, when we noticed that there was a picture of a fancy cocktail on Yelp: that this place is likely not the spicy amazing party in your mouth type of Thai food cooked by Thai Restaurant veterans. But hey, you never know right?At first, when we walked in, the fact that the server told us to sit at the door to wait for a seat and then disappeared without indicating how long the wait was (15 minutes) made me feel like this must be a real South-East Asian ran restaurant. However, when we got seated and noticed the lack of Asian patrons in the restaurant on a Saturday night - not a single one - I was a bit worried, but at this point it was too late. We ordered a fancy cocktail at 8 quid, some prawn crackers for 2.50, which arrived right away and we wolfed down. Then we waited. And then we waited. And then we waited. Everyone around us got their food, even those who came after us. \u00a0Our server, who was super nice, came up to us, without prompting, that she has no idea why we have not gotten our food yet and she would check. After a few minutes she came up to tell us the situation is a bit messy but we should get it soon.We waited, and then waited, and then the food came. The yellow curry served in a big bowl was bland. It was clear that curry sauce was pre-made and they threw in white chicken breast squares in there and heated up. No flavour whatsoever. The Drunken Noodle tasted like a very bland version of the Cantonese stir-fried beef ho-fun with basil. The beef was jerky and the noodle lacked in sauce. You can easily tell it's pre-made sauce, pre-cooked beef, tossed together with some flat noodles and vegetables. We left about half of our meal uneaten.They charged us 12.5% gratuity that a part of me really wanted to ask to be opted out because the food was so terrible and we waited for so long (1.5 hr ordeal and we took 10 minutes to wolf down some of our food). However, our server was nice so we left it as is. She also saved this review from being a one-star. I can't imagine why anyone would want to go to any of the locations for this chain.",

    "text": "I've yet to find incredible delivery food. Someone help me!? What am I doing wrong!? I ordered from Thai Square on a recent Sunday night. I wanted soup. And curry to clear my sinuses. Delivered to my bed. And. It was...fine. I mean a little less than fine. The curry was pretty bland (green), the Tom Kha soup with mushrooms was inedible though. It arrived lukewarm. Can you imagine a white soup with \u00a0HUGE mushroom slices floating in it, lukewarm? Not pretty. Taste to match. Delivery took 1h15m. The only saving grace were the appetizer \"golden pockets\" which were little fried dumplings with shrimp, veggies, etc and sweet/sour sauce. Those were good. That's about all I can say about it though, I was disappointed with the food entirely and wouldn't order again. Good Thai in London? Someone please enlighten me! Please!",

    "text": "Hmmm...I didn't have the missing fork problems of the other diners, and I definitely didn't think Thai square was terrible...it just wasn't nearly as good as other Thai places I have been to in London.We arrived in time for the 'early bird menu.' I must have eyes that are bigger than my stomach as my first thought was that the portions were quite small. However I was completely stuffed after a starter and a main course...so no problems on that front!We ordered 2 starters and 2 mains to share. One of each was good, and one of each was 'meh.' The only thing that was really terrible was the rice! It was sort of crunchy as if it had been made hours in advance. *cringes*",

    "text": "Another time we ordered takeaway, but with much more disastrous consequences. I've gotten the pad thai takeaway at Thai Square in the city before, so I thought it was a familiar name that I knew and could be comfortable with. Our starter was the Som Tum papaya salad, which doesn't have obvious peppers in it but is deceptively spicy. Finally we had Pad Kee Mao, another Medium spicy but in fact very very hot. Our last dish was the Gai Pad Krapraw with chicken, which was served with peppercorns and had us breaking out the milk to calm the taste buds. I have never been so mindblown with peppers... my boyfriend has a very high tolerance for spicy but in this case the peppers may have won. If those are what \"Medium\" dishes are, I fear what Hot may be. Eat with caution.",

Beautiful d\u00e9co, walls and furniture, extremely attentionate staff, delicious food, very clean toilets...My favourite dishes there will remain the armoatic duck for starters (go wild on the stuffing !!), the Mussaman Lamb curry, and the Weeping Tiger (one of the few true medium rare steaks I've had in London, besides the steakhouses...)To be honest, I don't understand the bad reviews on the right, although it is true that we had to ask for a knife twice...Still a good place though !",

    "text": "Previous reviewers have really said all that needs to be said about this place: it's solid and safe. The food is consistently tasty and the portion sizes are good. Pad Si-euw was pretty bland, although pad si-euw is meant to be really, but it came with good chunks of bok choi and once i poured some extra red curry sauce on it it was brilliant! The shared starter is good but expensive. Oh, the weeping tiger dish is fantastic - it's steak, after all. And they have Chang. For a unplanned 10pm-on-a-friday dinner stop, it was just about perfect. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back but wouldn't be upset if I found myself here again. And Thai food in London can be so bad, that it's handy to have a solid option.",

They have a pretty drinkable cocktail which is an Asian variation on the long island ice tea. Worth trying. No specific food item worth recommending but the red curry is decent.

Highlights:- Right on Upper Street.- Near the Angel Underground Station.- The food comes out quickly.- The prices are very reasonable.- I had the Pad Sei Yu [sp?] and it was one of the best I have had! It wasn't too salty and had lots of chicken and egg! My dinner partner had the sea bass, and it was perfect!Lowlights:- The service left a bit to be desired. They weren't unfriendly, just not friendly.- Not enough refills of water.Clearly, I have very few lowlights so my experience was far from being bad! In the mood for Thai and in Islington, head over here!",

It's a safe option, food is always tasty, decor isbearable and I can't fault the staff.I do think it's more westernised than alot of places (the salads are like the premix bags you can buy in the supermarket and the food is not overly spicy) but overall, I have found the food tasty, they use good Thai ingredients and have nice condiments at the table. Portions are good sized and the price is pretty standard.Safe place to take someone for a meal as you know it will be tasty and fine.",
