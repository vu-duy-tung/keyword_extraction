We once sauntered in for a casual dinner after not being able to settle on a venue and learning that this particular one does student discounts. The burgers are amazing and you can build your own so if you're the fussy type (I know I am) you can get creative. I didn't order the dessert but thank god my friend did because the chocolate mousse was simply divine. Comfy, cosy restaurant with average prices (factor in the student discount and you can convince yourself you've got a fair deal!).",

Our reservations (and yes, you NEED to make reservations as this place is tiny) were for 8.45--we finally got seated at 9.10 and food didn't arrive until 9.40. Do you know who I am? I don't Queue. and I CERTAINLY don't wait an hour for food.But....the Wagyu burger was pretty epic. Ignore the menu, get it medium rare instead of medium. Melt.In.Mouth. Seriously top quality burger.I will abstain from any more comments on service, as it was explained to us as the above...I'll wait til I go again and see if it's still atrocious.",

If the mood takes you you can try the camel, boar or kangaroo burgers. Last night I had the Mexican burger which was great! I also had the biggest onion rings that I have ever seen and a vanilla cheesecake that actually made me sad when it was gone. I love the Greedy Cow and will definitely be back soon.",

    "text": "An adequate 'gourmet' hamburger joint just by Mile End tube station, this restaurant offered respite after a long day of walking around the area and not seeing too much of interest in the culinary sense.The option to have a tuna fillet 'burger' was unique for London, and I was quick to capitalise on it; however, it arrived fully cooked through despite me having ordered it medium-rare. This means one of two things: either the tuna wasn't fresh enough to serve rare or the person cooking it didn't know how to cook tuna properly. However you look at it, it's not good.The chips were tasty, if a bit ho-hum.The home-made still lemonade was nice.The service was a bit weird. We had to knock on the door in order to be allowed in the restaurant, as the door was locked. I found this particularly strange. The server was quick to suggest avocado to top my tuna burger after I asked for a recommendation, but she looked at me as if I were crazy for ordering the guacamole instead. The pop music playing over the Bose speakers initially seemed to me an odd choice; the entire album by Duffy that began playing shortly after our arrival sort of made me want to do a runner onto Grove Road, if only the front door hadn't been locked with a key.Overall, this is a good place to come if you're looking for a burger in Mile End, I guess, but certainly not a place I'd travel any considerable distance for in the future.",

It was good, not amazing. I think next time I would get it with some more sauce toppings. The bun was a bit dry which could border line ruin the meal but it was ok. We ordered potato wedges to share and they where good as well. Service was excellent.It was a bit pricey. I think they have a lunch special of 6.50.. that sounds more reasonable.",

It's the kind of place your dad might take you to. Slightly '70's decor and loads of burgers on the menu with international flavoured toppings. I always go for the Italian (palma ham and mozzarella) without the bun. For the more adventurous sorts there's camel, unicorn and donkey burgers. Every time I've been in the service has been better than average for London and they've even made me an iced latte off menu. All in all I think you'll like it.",

And massive points off for filling Heinz bottles with inferior ketchup. \u00a0Generally I was left with the feeling that The Greedy Cow is simply someone's attempt to cash in on the \"gourmet burger craze\" and that they are more about novelty (kangaroo, camel etc) than they are about quality. \u00a0\u00a39-10 for burgers with no sides, \u00a33 for frozen potato wedges etc. Not good value by any means. \u00a0Six of us went together and none of us felt happy about it afterwards.",

Easily one of the best burgers I've had in London... So what did I eat.. Well it was like something out of a dream... Hot, spicy Mexican chicken, tenderly cooked on a fluffy bun, complete with guacamole and salsa.. Omg this even exists!!! Anyone who knows me, knows I'm a Mexican obsessive and this completely hit the spot!! Wowwww still in the burger induced coma, as I write.. I obviously got the sweet potato fries.. Was kinda in a conundrum whether to get this or the wedges.. Goddamit I've been eating loads of sweet potato recently!!! Woww did I make the right decision!! Crispy, flavoursome and setting the standard!! Drinks wise, I was about to be uber boring and get peroni (disclaimer - it's my fave lager - so I can be forgiven) but they'd changed their draft taps and so I was offered some other choices, including a Japanese lager which I'd never heard of it. Adventure is my middle name, so after a quick sample, I thought why the hell not and of course, it was so tasty! It totally didn't look like a lager, but boy it could compete with any lager I had recently! Now by this point, I'm almost, fooded out, but after reading all these reviews crazy hot for the chocolate fondant, who am I to resist? Well I have 10 minutes to prepare because they had to freshly make it and damnnnn was it worth the wait!! It was incredible! The smell of the chocolate fondant was incredible and the taste.. even BETTER!! Yeaaaaah if you go there and leave with trying the fondant, it'll be the biggest mistake you'll make.. Oooh I'm picturing the chocolate oozing out and now I want it all over AGAIN!!",

    "text": "Went there for lunch with a friend and they had a deal where you can get a burger, side and an unlimited drink for \u00a37.50 from Monday-Friday.This seems like a rediculously good offer for any kind of substantial/sit down lunch in London, let alone a burger.So I ordered the regular 6oz burger and it was pretty good. Decent flavour, nice bun, definintely worth it. I don't think I'd go as far as some other reviewers and say it was one of the best burgers I've had but it ranks reasonably high up the list.As a side I had sweet potato fries which were great. I'm a huge lover of sweet potato fries and these were great. Cripsy, tasty and there were a lot of them. Nothing worse when you go to a burger place and they don't give you enough fries, happy to say this wasn't the case.I had a coke as a drink and normally I wouldn't go into detail about this because it's just a coke but I'll tie in my point about the staff. They were checking on us and asking if we wanted more drinks etc. Really went out of their way to ensure everything was up to par which can't be said for every lunch place on a Monday in London. Big big props to the staff at the place.My friend had the sliders of the camel, kangaroo and wild boar and enjoyed them. I'll take his word for it since it seems like he knows his food.He also got a side of onion rings which were massive. I mean these are huge but what's great is that there was enough of them (I mean you kind of expect that when you pay \u00a33 for a side but still). I tried one and there were crispy and more-ish.Definitely a great lunch spot, would go there again. As I student I was happy I didn't have to fork out \u00a310-\u00a315+ on a meal.",

We went in for a Sunday dinner after a long walk along the canal all the way from Angel.The menu offers quite an exotic selection of meats such as camel, kangaroo and wild boar. We went straight into mains: I had a camel burger with sweet potato chips and my partner went for a Japanese beef burger Wagyu which is regarded as the best in the world as the cattle is being specially fed with beer and traditionally massaged.According to my partner, the taste was not exceptional, but as for the camel burger, then its red medium cooked meat tasted really good. It went well with the mashed potatoes with cheese as a side which was deliciuos.We finished the meal with their signature dessert Chocolate Fondant that was really worth it - highly recommended. 5 stars for the food and the concept!",

There is one server here that I greatly appreciate as he seems to care a good deal about customers and makes sure everything gets out quick and efficiently. \u00a0The chocolate fondant is essentially one of those molten lava cake things, and it takes about ten to fifteen minutes to make, but it is totally worth it. For the first time having something like this, the chocolate actually comes out like liquid lava, smooth and creamy, and the cake is a true delicacy. The server did not lie when he said it is \"by far, the best on the menu\". I had a cocktail and was surprised by the sheer size of it. The primary issue I have is with a separate server that took forever to bring my change back to the table when I had to give a bill with a greater amount than I owed. Other than that, fantastic service and great food, I say give it a shot-I would recommend this place to anyone",

There was a blast of a bit of salt on the first bite, but as the meat juices all came together, it was just right. My advice is to load up on some sides and appetizers if you come hungry b/c just this order of steak is not enough. Others ordered the burgers and burgers w/o buns. Looked like good portions and looked delic. Next visit I'll get a burger.",

And after that, the service was terrible, we placed our orders straight away, but food took so long that we started inquiring about where it was because it was close to 10pm by that point and we had arrived at 8.Perhaps they were having an off Friday night. The food was excellent on both occasions (burgers), but I would not go there again without a reservation.",

Being Friday night with no reservation anywhere I was doubtful of getting my wish. So I rang up Greedy Cow anyway to ask what their availability was. I was told that at that moment they had some space, brilliant! We only live down the road so we headed down. When we arrived I was pleasantly surprised that we had a table reserved for us as I was expecting to just be a walk in.The service is excellent here. I ordered a rib eye with chips. Our waitress laughed when I informed my other half I would not be sharing any of my chips with him. He ordered the Mexican burger with onion rings and of course his own chips. My steak was delicious, rare just how I like it. My husband was very quiet while he devoured his burger, just giving me a firm nod when I asked him what it was like.Overall a lovely impromptu Friday dinner.",
