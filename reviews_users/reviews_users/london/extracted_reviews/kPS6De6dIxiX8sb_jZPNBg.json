    "text": "Nestled under an overhanging grey office building and looking out over the romantic (if slightly scummy) waters of Docklands is the newly opened Hazev Turkish restaurant.Decorated by someone with a serious fetish for wood carvings and curtains, it comes across as a kind of \"formal christmas\" vibe which means it will be interesting to see if that attracts punters during the summer months. Perhaps they'll take back the curtains then - which at one point billowed from what I thought was a wall and almost enveloped me to the amusement of my friends. It has only been open for a few days, it was already filling out with a small crowd of people but with so many tables free then there was no problems getting a window seat. My two work colleagues had joined me to curiously try this place out, especially rating it against the other nearby Turkish restaurant, Mez.Staff thronged the entrance way and we were efficiently scooted over to the aforementioned window seat and drink orders taken.We decided on one colleague ordering from the menu and the other two of us going for the set menu \"choose a starter and a main for 9.99\" deal.Then the formally attired waiter brought our drinks - and he had gotten mine wrong. Diet coke instead of my lemonade. I valiantly pointed this out to him with quivering lower lip and ... actually I didn't really care to be honest, so I told him of the mistake (how will he learn otherwise?) and then said I would just take the coke. If he had been bringing me a coke instead of a beer or wine then I might have been annoyed.Warm, soft and very tempting bread arrived with a small set of humus and about 8 olives. Not going overboard on the quantity there but then they brought some more with the meal and looking on the bill later on, it was free after all.After a few minutes, justifiable since they appeared to be actually cooking the food in an open kitchen area rather than just heating it up, our starters arrived. Menu-boy got a tasty looking veggie cheese on a mound of mushrooms thing (Hellim?), while us Setcourse-boys got an edible set of greens with garlic (Maydanoz Salatasi?). Damning with faint praise maybe but actually it was just as well prepared and set out as when I've had it in other Turkish places - interesting but not startling.Then the main course arrived... Menu-boy had... something (Mentar apparently). To be honest I was too busy tearing into my lamb shish.Wonderfully cooked and still nicely sizzling hot on the inside which shows it came straight from the grill rather than loitering under a heatlamp. \u00a0Gorgeous and slightly crispy on the outside, these big blocks of lamb were lovely. Served with cous-cous which was moist enough (dry cous-cous is a pet hate of mine) and a nice set of veggies.Finished up with some pistachio turkish delight cubes and left looking curiously at the nicely appointed bar area which we will have to try some evening after work.Despite the drink mix up, which is probably due to new staff, I liked this place. I may order off menu next time too...Matt",

    "text": "This was a bit of a disappointment in terms of food. I suppose I was expecting above average food after several of my acquaintances couldn't stop raving about it. Either that, or we didn't know what to order.The Somon Tava, or skewers of deep fried Salmon was an easy eat. It's a quick clean up of the pallete and the deep fried part is not too much of a bother.Between the three of us, two of us wanted to go with something 'light' - so we abandoned any lingering desire for lamb and decided to jump in for chicken. Bademli Tavuk, or chicken casserole with almonds, tomatoes and green peppers. It sounded like something that could never go wrong - seriously, what could you have done to a perfectly sound combination of unsuspecting ingredients? For starters, someone mistranslated the English. What came looking like shreded chicken and broad beans, was really almonds. It should have really read Almonds with chicken, garnished with roasted peppers and tomatoes. OK - maybe it's just me, but at least 30 percent of my plate was full of almonds. I can't imagine why you would let a bland meat be overpowered by such a strong textured, albeit mildly flavored, nut. This main even came well recommended by one of the waiters.The Tuna Sote, chunks of tuna in a cream sauce, was super fishy. That tuna needs to be cooked a lot more for continued inclusion with the sauce. Or something else? I was born with a fish in my mouth, and I would like to think I know fish. They don't come like that.All in all, it seems like very little work went into perfecting the recipes. Going by the sample, however unrepresentative, Hazev definitely needs some work done on modifying these recipes (not just fine tuning).Five stars for the lovely location by the waterfront though! :-) The waiters were friendly and helpful and service was quick and elegant.",

God love 'em), cosy chairs, mismatched tables... just one of those comfortable places where you don't mind settling in for a few hours. But instead of coffee shop cuisine, they offer amazing Turkish meze involving a pic'n'mix of three different selections and home baked bread for the same price as your daily coffee and muffin. Places this awesome this don't exist in the real world - thus having to leave central London and travel well beyond a 'healthy' commute to South Quay (a name that may or may not have also been the name of a far off galaxy in Battlecruiser Millennium's freeware version). But I must admit, Hazev was worth it. The food was, dare I say, out of this world.",

    "text": "My second attempt to this restaurant after a very dissapointing first. \u00a0This time I recognize most of the Turkish dish after my trip to istanbul. For starter, we ordered prawn in garlic, tomatoish sauce. Ordered the lamb shank and stuffed squid as main. \u00a0All good except the stuffed squid not the best, not as tasty as we thought. For dessert, we ordered milk rice pudding and kadayif with walnut (rather than pistachio) again very dissapointing, overly sweet, the cinnamon overpower the dessert and it doesn't taste good in general. Not sure if I have tasted the real thing that's why I have something to compare to but for sure there is room for improvement to bring the local taste to London. As for service, have to say it is very bad. We were guided to our table and after the main, basically we have to catch the attention of several waiters passing by us to bring us water, dessert menu and bill. It is quite annoying because we are sitting right at the place where it leads to the kitchen door. I will not strongly recommend this restaurant to my friends but I guess is a quick fix for Turkish food....",

The baba ghanoush had a delicious roastiness, the hummus was creamy, and the tabbouleh was fresh. There were a few complex salads that I didn't know (one had lots of nuts) but were even better than the familiar favorites. A definite go if you're in the area. There is a deli on one side and a more formal sit down restaurant on the other, so you can easily get takeout if that's your vibe.",

    "text": "Beautiful location. Right on the quay, this is a quite spacious Turkish resturant/ bar/ cafe in canary wharf. With this many purposes, Havez should be put down as a 'go-to' / last resort for any occasion. I certainly enjoyed my drink here, not too sure whether its a good thing, but its away from the hussle that you will find in this area. I mean I hate queuing for my drinks, I like to sit and chill with scenery and with the option of sitting inside and outside with comfortable seats, I like to be close to the station, and I like the option to either have a a drink, or quick sit down meal. Being a Turkish resturant is just a bonus for me. Service is good, and friendly, food is decent. And venue is big but has charm, with slight Turkish theme. Overall a good experience.",

Tried the deli food, though they were happy to order from the restaurant menu a tomato soup, as all they served in the deli was red lentil soup, which was very tasty. Tried an assortment of cold meze and it was generally good flavour and decent portions. Not overwhelmed by flavours here but the service is friendly, the ambience very chilled for a cafe-deli and its clean and fresh.They also sell Turkish oil, wine and sauces, snacks, cheese etc. Most with the Tas brand.",

The place comes with bread and olives for free appetisers. Bread is good but they don't give you that much - you can always ask for more - it's free. The food came out super quick. I ordered the mix grill with sauce (forgot the Turkish name for it) and before I knew it the waiter was ready to served the dish to me. Overall it's not the best Turkish in London but it does provide a place to go to is you're craving Turkish in Canary Wharf. I'd go again if I'm in the area.",

It's pretty beautiful actually but also you feel like something is about to go REALLY WRONG like a meteorite hitting. It would be a great set for a disaster-in-space movie to have its On Earth Denoument.Anyway...Hazev is not quite so dramatic. I don't know - it's nice? It's clean? It has Turkish Food? It has Turkish wine actually, which was exciting (although more for novelty value than absolute deliciousness. Not that I know anything about wine). It has quite a cool design - one end is a cafe & deli, one end is a bar. All of it is beautifully decorated although maybe its a tad impersonal (but that's in keeping with the style of the area).Food is standard and neither bad nor good. The dolma didn't taste freshly made, the kofte was decent (I should have had the sucuk but I was kind of on a date so was avoiding garlic although really why was I worried considering that person once kissed me after eating McDonalds: the horror).I've had too many liquorice allsorts and have overshared in this review.

Meanwhile the food is pretty average; we went for a selection of unpronounceable hot and cold starters to share, but you know a menu is lacking when the humus and bread is the most moreish thing you eat (mmm SO good though - just get 5 rounds of that!).The service was... confusing. Veering between over-attentively refilling our wine to spillage point and running out after us with the umbrella I'd left behind (yay), to being distracted by a conversation with a fellow waitress whilst taking our order and taking 15mins to bring the bill after we asked. Not ideal.Nice place to try if you're in the area - good veggie choice and there's pretty enough views of the river, but I don't feel the need to go back in a hurry.",

Although the entrance doors are separate for each part, there are doors inside in between the parts that enable you to change the location accordingly. I pass this place at least twice every day. Its location right by the path next to the Thames and its 'olive tree style' decorations with tiny lights on the trees outside make you feel want to 'pop in for a while' after a long day...",
