It's nice to see the owner expand his stall to the larger caravan sized stall that they operate out of. For about \u00a36, I used to order a huge burrito that you can get with chicken, pork or beef. I preferred the chicken because it had that slightly charring that added a level of smokiness the other meats never used to have. It's fairly simple where you follow the line and they ask if you want other fillings and how hot you want it (mine - always the very spicy with extra chillis). It's great as a lunch and one of the more flavoursome burritos I've had around town.",

I honestly don't understand why this place has such high marks. The beans and rice was as bland as could be; the salsa tasted canned and the overall flavour was just OK. The tortilla chips were decent (and salted like I like them), but everything else was a bit of a let down. I was trying to decide between 2 or 3 stars, but because this place it basically a cart...it gets 2 stars. Sorry to say, but this place is all hype!",

The food it's self is delicious \u00a0Mexican burritos (Spanish for little donkey, apparently) in various flavours - the chicken is my favourite. Once ordered it goes along the assembly line until you get to the sauces. At this point you can choose how hot you want it to be.

From what I could tell he had never really had a burrito before (I'm a burrito fanatic), but we both got fajita burritos, mine veggie and his steak. The one downside to mine was that they forgot to put in the guacamole, or maybe I'm just supposed to tell them, I guess since guacamole might be foreign and weird to some? No matter, it was still very tasty. However I did make the mistake of going for the hottest salsa and couldn't finish my burrito because my eyes were tearing up so badly! My friend fared much better and seemed to really like his burrito, saying he was pleasantly surprised. Knowing and loving Chipotle, I'm not sure which is better, taste-wise. They're about at the same level, although I believe Chipotle in England doesn't offer fajita burritos (they do in America) so it's a bummer. Considering, however, that Daddy D is about \u00a31 less than those at Chipotle, next time I'm craving one of them beauties if it's lunch time I'm going for Daddy D :D",

I am not sure whether this is because of their expansion into Brick Lane, or because a lot of top quality competition is now available but whatever the reason, Daddy Donkey is no longer the Daddy in my opinion. Last time I went there, My burrito was assembled inconsistently. I was first met by bland rice, followed by a face full of sour cream and cheese, followed by some meat, and finally by a sludge of beans and chilli sauce. It was rather unpleasant, but if they can fix their assembly line problems they are in with a chance to regain their former crown as my number 1 burrito in London. The ingredients were fine, it's just that it seemed to be rolled the wrong way. The 3 stars are temporary until I can go back there and give them a chance to redeem themselves.",

Saying that it was still ruddy delicious, burritos aren't as hard as they used to be to get hold of in London so with this new competition I think I'm going to plum for 3 stars.The staff were friendly and the tortilla chips were tastier than they are in Chilango but the steak I had was quite chewy and the guy on the till was very abrupt with me and got me a Coke when I asked for a Sprite. There's only two benches to sit down on and they're outside. I think I should make that quite clear to Yelp that this is a stall on the market, I went here based on Yelp reviews and didn't quite pick that up and was kind of expecting to sit inside, still there's nothing wrong with that as long as you realise.So yes 3 stars because it's good food but it could be a lot better.",

Happy to say I am not disappointed as a lot of market stalls can be hit and miss especially after the lunchtime rush. I went for the Tomatillo beef burrito. Tasted fresh and was well wrapped. Beef was shredded, full of flavour and plentiful. Will try the Steak next time. Only downsides were that I was rushed through the ordering process so fast (still in lunch rush mode I think) that I couldn't hear or make out what the staff were saying. Also I felt that the price was a little too high for a market stall burrito with no seating. Remember to pick up a napkin, they didnt put one in the bag. Overall a really good burrito that reminded me of something you would get served in San Fran. If this were in an area I travel too more frequently it would become a regular food stop.",

These things were flavourless, the coriander rice was indistinguishable from plain rice, and worst of all, even the 'spicy' sauce makes you question if there are chillis in it.Then, one morning I was struck by the compulsion to have a proper breakfast out before heading to the office, so I struck out for Le Regal, my go-to Full English destination... only to discover it had closed. Shock and horror! On my way back toward the office, I stumbled across DD's sign promoting their breakfast burrito and thought to myself, 'Self, you might as well give them one last chance, right?' Why not?I requested such an item, with black beans, please. A blob of microwaved(?) egg-y substance plopped out of a plastic jug onto the chopping board along with a massive sausage. Both were diced into chunks through the use a near-mezzaluna-sized blade and handily transported to my burrito on the knife's flat. A few dollops of salsa and a sprinkling of grated cheese later, I was off on my merry way with breakfast burrito in tow.How did it stack up? Considering the options for breakfast burritos in the city number in the single digits (as far as I'm aware... do correct me if I'm wrong), it's a wonder that there's an outlet within walking distance of my flat. Compared to the real thing? It's still a dim shadow.If they threw in some proper spicy chorizo, a couple of seasoned home fries, and some honest-to-goodness scrambled eggs, we'd be getting closer. As it stands, I'm just grateful to have a mediocre stand-in. And it's easy enough to doctor up with enough Cholula...",

    "text": "After months of hearing epic tales of Daddy Donkey from my closest network of burrito fanciers, my visit there today was completely by accident after walking to another nearby burrito vendor and finding it closed. My colleague's eyes lit up, and he said in an excited low whisper, \"We could always go to Daddy Donkey...\". Approaching the van \u00a0I was surprised to see that it was a self-contained van, rather than the more \"cart\" arrangement at Freebird \u00a0the popularity of the place became apparent, by way of the blue Tensabarriers erected for crowd control, and also the apologetic notice that due to Friday popularity they could only now accept orders of up to 5 burritos per customer. They were getting through the orders fairly swiftly though, and so it wasn't long before I'd negotiated the gauntlet of smiley burrito assembly line workers and was hooking with gusto into my first ever Picadillo burrito - a sort of spicy ground beef arrangement. Maybe the problem was the constant hyperbole, however my burrito verdict on this occasion was \"Good\". Even if you factored in the atmospheric component of sitting at the scattered handful of rickety furniture (which my colleague assured me was \"very mexican\"), there was no denying that what I had was a very tasty yet poorly constructed burrito... almost as if they'd rolled it sideways, such that with each bite you got a mouthful of a successive ingredient. And nobody wants a mid-lunchtime mouthful of cold sour cream. My burrito companion looked at me with deflated shoulders and confessed that he'd just chomped into a complete mouthful of rice, and that by comparison to usual it was all a bit bland. To its credit, my final bite appeared to contain most of the salsa sauce, and as I wandered up and down Leather Lane waiting for my colleague to finish I noted that the flavour persisted and was incredibly tasty. But that doesn't catapult a burrito vendor into the coveted 5-star category. There was absolutely no question as to the quality of the ingredients - however you've got to know how to assemble them right too, and on this occasion the donkey daddy made an ass of itself.",

When I asked where we were going his eyes kind of glazed over and he whispered...\"Daddy Donkey!\" Now I don't know if it was his Greek accent or the far off look in his eyes, but the way he said \"Daddy Donkey\" I walked out of the office wondering if we were going for food or to some kind of male stripper lunch spot...ooooo Daddy Donkey. We walked through a maze of various stalls and I'm looking from side to side, expecting to see a dark door or some secret passages leading to this mystical place. After walking, what felt like miles, we arrived at a food stand with a very long queue and I start to get excited as I realise that Daddy Donkey sells burritos! Finally...has this American girl found her burrito salvation! Come on...you can totally understand my excitement, with a name like Daddy Donkey I'm expecting a donkey of a burrito, whatever that means, but for the sake of argument let's just say it means a damn good burrito.I'm almost giddy with excitement as I order my burrito and practically run back to the office, taste buds salivating! Unwrapping the burrito is bliss as I feel its weight and smell the chicken and cheese...yummy. I take a big bite and as the flavor bursts across my tongue I'm left.... well... a bit disappointed. Maybe I had too many expectations but there is no ecstasy...no joy...no VA VA Voom! The burrito was underwhelming! It lacked the punch I'm accustomed to from truly superb burritos and on top of that it needed salt. So sadly, my quest continues for an amazing burrito in London and I'll have to continue getting my burrito fix in America....oh the memories of shrimp burritos in Cali......hmmmm.",

I mean that just sounds wrong... in SO many ways. Anyroad, despite the fact that on this side of the pond we seem to be sadly lacking in good Mexican food (yelp.co.uk/topic/manches\u2026 - come on, you know you want to sound off), here is a four-legged hoofed beast of a problem solver. One cart, several efficient staff, and if you're anything like me don't get all distracted by the fact that the tall, dark and somewhat good-looking one can speak fluent Spanish as these guys work fast and you'll get severely bumped as you move along in line. This is London, remember. T'up North we might stand there chin-stroking and debating mild versus medium salsa, but you try any of that nonsense in The Big Smoke and you'll get a short sharp shock.I have to say, this was the best attempt I've experienced thus far. A deliciously soft wrap, fresh ingredients and plenty of each... no wonder I was searching for matchsticks to prop open my eyes that afternoon, I needed a big burrito bobos. There are plenty of choices too, you can grab veggies, chicken, pork, beef, and you can even forsake the wrap for a 'naked burrito'. All in all this was great value and it certainly did the job for a Mexican-deprived Brit like me. I'm just once again apologising for the extreme red onion breath I had for the rest of the day, sheesh, they don't scrimp on those bad boys!",

Went there and was impressed by their attitudes and general 'can do' spirit that, frankly, almost no restaurants in London have. However...the downsides are numerous. Basically its kind of a tie between this place and chipotle and you should probably then come here to support the local business but you're going to essentially get a bad burrito. Again starting with the positives - the tortilla was good and the chicken tasted good. The guacamole...was sh*t. I have no idea how you create bad guacamole, especially because, against all intuition, avocados in London are excellent. The lettuce looked old to me - I don't know how old - probably not a full day but old enough to look wilted and sad. Again, its lettuce we are referring to here - super easy to get right.On the 'harder to get right' front - the rice. Just wrong across the board - wrong type of rice, wrongly cooked with the wrong spices. Oy. They also only had a choice of black beans and I know its hard to get pinto beans in London but you should just do that anyway. Enteros or refried are key if you are a burrito joint. And just have onions and cilantro - they simply have to be there. It can be optional but its got to be there...Someone in London, some time, did some seriously bad sh*t to someone from Mexican American heritage (note: burritos are NOT Mexican) and they put a curse on this city saying that no one will ever be served a good burrito here. Or hopefully it was just a length of time because this is getting ridiculous. Normally when I eat a burrito from a truly good (and simple and cheap btw) place in the States, I'm baffled as to how they have made it so good. Here I was baffled how they could get it so wrong.",

All the ingredients are fresh, and the portions are big! The service is amazing and compared to some other places on Leather Lane that you can wait in line quite a while for, these guys speed people through the door, and yet don't compromise on quality.Top 3 tips for this place-1.Go big-Get all the sides and mix up on the salsa-taste sensations!2.Be prepared to queue, but it won't take more than 5-10 mins as this guys are quick!3.Chicken is my favourite, but the steak is pretty good as well!",

Thankfully they haven't moved far.I always go for a naked burrito in a box because it helps to try to keep it from going down my shirt. Sometimes it works, sometimes not so much. On this occasion I went for the shredded beef with peppers and rice (no beans), with the tomatillo salsa, lettiuce and cheese and of course paid extra for the guacamole.Credit where credit is due, nothing overpowered anything else. You could taste the seasoning on the beef separately from the salsa, even when they were in the same bite. Great salsa by the way, I'd eat a flip flop dunked in that stuff.It's a bit of a squeeze in the ship. But they have outside seating do I just sat there and are it up - while hungry members of the queue stared on jealously.",

Now I'm a bit further afield but had to be in the area for something else so excitedly sought out the new-to-me location. And I was considerably underwhelmed. I always get the Daddy D in a box, which is rice and black beans with the normal burrito toppings on top. Gone was the ground beef I favoured. The rice was dry. The beans were under seasoned and claggy. The shredded beef I got had no flavour and reminded me of leftovers from a bad roast. The guacamole was over pur\u00e9ed avocado with too much tomato. A let down overall, and at \u00a37.50, not even good value. The burrito search continues.",

    "text": "Let's face it, we all love them, Burritos are an excellent feed but in my opinion they can be done very well and very badly. I'm more than happy to announce (because it's close to my office) that Daddy Donkey have their Burrito game on point! DD is a small Mexican spot on Leather Lane that puts the quality of the food at the centre of everything, the way it should be. The normal highlights like tacos and standard burritos grace the menu, but where they really stick out is their \"Kick-Ass\" and \"Daddy-D\" burritos. Basically they both cram as much of the insanely flavourful fillings in one wrap as psychically possible, it's a skill just to behold! All the meats and various fillings are as fresh as they come, you can see the staff in the background constantly churning these out and the smell that hits you from that freshly grilled steak is enough to make you take a few steps back. I went for the steak Daddy-D and it was almost a challenge to take down. An absolute feed, be sure you're going with an empty stomach. Went for the hot spice level and was nice to see that hot actually means hot. I like a good kick and this sufficiently made eyes and noses run. The guacamole is also excellent, I feel this is a good mark of a mexican spot and like most of the food, they've nailed it. I'd actually recommend getting the guac and chips on the side as the taste is so good, you don't want to risk loosing it amongst the hugeness of the burrito.Nice drink selection and free water is a nice touch to ease those spice pains. Prices are too severe too, had a very decent lunch and a drink for about \u00a311, excellent work.One slight issue would be the size of the line at lunchtime (especially Friday's). Leather Lane is a food-hub and from about 11-2 every day it is very busy. The line to DD normally extends out the door and mildly down the street. I waited for about 8-10 minutes but honestly, take it in, it's more than worth it. Excellent work DD, get down there...why?..because you Mexi-\"CAN\". Oh, god, i'm sorry.",

It took until a few weeks ago to get there though, and when I did, I proceeded to make myself sick on a pretty darn amazing burrito.I'm not really a burrito person, but they do a nice job of offering the ingredients that make it a simple, tasty experience. The burritos are huge, definitely satisfying, and a good price.I do wish they had other options, but the burritos are kind of the main option. At least they're good burritos though!",

When I saw the queue my legs wobbled - I was afraid, I was petrified, that I would never get to the counter before fainting. But, fear not, the tide of the Daddy Donkey lunchtime ride is swift and calmly envelopes you toward your goal, giving you enough time to choose amongst the variations and actually get excited about putting food in your mouth.I went for a fajita burrito, chicken, no jalapenos, extra guacamole and mild strength. My palate is of a delicate temperament and I didn't want to fill up on water over food - the resulting burrito? Beautiful. Flavoursome, stout, fat and proudly wrapped in foil. Watch the drippage, it's a messy and cumbersome toil but well worth it for the satisfaction. If you are a lucky camper you can even rest your feet post queue on their diddy donkey tables and pass the time by staring at the various amusing comic figures adorned on their van. A definite must for a hunk of fulsome fodder of a lunch-time period. Win!",

And for a non-burrito lover (don't hate me), that's saying something.They have the most efficient assembly line ever. I always get the veggie, which gets guac free, unlike the meat versions. One time, I was convinced that they forgot my guac; however, on unwrapping back at my office, I discovered I was mistaken. They are just that fast.Prices are high, though. I can get the same amount of food for less at the Thai cart, or at KIN, both within walking distance. I think the prices have gone up twice in the last year, though they have finally introduced a loyalty program to mitigate.",
