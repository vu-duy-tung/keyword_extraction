They do have beef ribs on the menu which is different but everything to do with the setup / location / cost is not all that memorable.

    "text": "So I'm in town for business and happened by Bodean's and being a barbecue nut I just had to stop and try it. \u00a0 We came in for lunch and I ordered the burnt ends and ribs. \u00a0 Now I love a good brisket and can turn out a pretty good one myself on my own smoker whenever I have a spare 15 hours or so. \u00a0 This que was disappointing for a true barbecue nut - if you like barbecue but aren't a fanatic about it like I am then you'll probably like this place. \u00a0First off the meat was obviously cooked in a gas smoker with only a little wood added. \u00a0You could taste it in the meat. \u00a0They aren't the only one's doing this as it is an increasing trend in the US as well. \u00a0 I prefer more smoke as long as it isn't overpowering. \u00a0They are cooking in the middle of the city so I suppose you could cut them some slack for that though. \u00a0The ribs were also a bit on the thin side. \u00a0They were baby backs - I prefer spares but will take baby backs if they have a good flavor - these didn't taste much like anything and had very little meat on them. \u00a0 I was in a butcher shop earlier in my trip and saw ribs trimmed right to the bone so that may have something to do with how they trim them on this side of the pond. \u00a0Still I wished I had gotten the pulled pork instead of the ribs. The only thing I liked was the barbecue sauce. \u00a0That was good and balanced well. \u00a0If it had been paired with a decent set of ribs then it would have really been something. My friend opted for the burger (8oz) and he really liked it. \u00a0Said it was quite tasty and the fries were good. \u00a0 The staff was warm and friendly so that is a saving grace. \u00a0Everyone made an effort to ensure that we enjoyed our meal. \u00a0I suppose I should upgrade my stars since they are here in the UK and not back home. \u00a0I did consider it but felt I should rate them as if they were right down the street from me instead of practically halfway around the world. \u00a0Would I return? \u00a0Perhaps but probably not. \u00a0Would I if I lived here - probably. \u00a0Would I if this were right down the street from where I lived - most certainly not. Still its probably the best your going to get in the UK so there is that going for them...If your hankering for a taste from home - give it a shot otherwise there are plenty of other places around that have much better food here in London.",

    "text": "Decent place if you're craving for meat, or want to watch some American sports, which is usually on (unless there's a Chelsea game). Typical American-style BBQ/steak place. I've been there a couple of times, and each time the service is friendly and fast. Foodwise, its quite standard, and I would consider a bit pricey for the quality you are getting. Don't get me wrong; its definitely tasty, but I wonder if it might be a bit too much to pay for what is meant to be hearty, sloppy meal. Portionwise, the mains are huge though. The only gripe is that there's not much space inside, so the tables are a bit crammed together and if you're watching a game there while having a leisurely drink and meal, you might feel a bit jammed.

Our order arrived just after 5 min waiting, so it seems they have all prepared and the plates are sitting in the kitchen. That would explain why our meat was dry. The ribs where completely dried out and the pulled pork was only good with a lot of sauce on the side. Our waitress wasn't very welcoming neither. Overall it more feels a bit like mass market for American food. I wouldn't go back there. At least the prices are good for Central London.",

Then I ordered the buffalo burger with blue cheese. But as we all know, blue cheese has an acquired taste and i did not think it belonged in the burger and that gave it a horrible taste and smell. So my main was not all that great. Anyway the staff at this branch were very helpful and quite efficent. As I was trying to eat this burger with an awful taste and smell, the waiter who was serving the table oppostie us had spilt 4 cups of drink accidently on the table and the people sitting there. The waiter was so embarrassed and apologetic. Im sure they were compensated for this minor mistake as they continued the evening with smiles and laughter. Also on a friday it is always busy so you most likely wont recieve a table unless your early.",

After a triumphant Fulham win, we were all hungry and seeing as it was nearly 10pm, a lot of places were not open or serving. However, Bodeans was there to save our hungry stomachs. I had myself a nice little Ribs and Chicken combo along with a bunch of shared entrees. What is the best here? Some say the ribs, some say it's the sauce, I say it is Sam Adams. Cold, available and in your hands in a few quick minutes. Sam Adams is a tough Yank beer to find around London, less and less places are serving it as it is an \"Import.\" Regardless, the food was good and beer was great. I've not had a bad meal at Bodeans yet. They are pretty consistent. They will never be as good as the places I've been in Texas or even California for that matter, but they will definitely fix your craving for good ribs.",

Order at 6pm, pay 6 quid) the faux? antler chandeliers and broadcasts of American sports (including college ball, which is the only ball I enjoy) worked in its favor. Here's the thing though, while our first 3 visits that first summer were amazing, it's never been the same. The last couple of times we gave it a chance, the meat was overcooked, the pumpkin pies were dry and had burnt puffy skin on top, and the portions were a bit smaller. And so, meh.

Instead of the down home Atlanta ribs joint you get in Soho, this felt like a TGI Fridays or an Applebee's. i.e. uninspired and a bit tacky. I ordered a steak, cooked medium,with a baked potato and a side of corn on the cob. My wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich. It's never a good sign when your baked potato is bigger than your steak. Granted it was a massive baked potato but it dwarfed my 12oz steak. Also my \"medium\" steak was anything but. Is there anything beyond well-done? If there is, that's what my steak was. Blech. The potato was good, as was the grilled corn. My wife said her pulled pork sandwich was good. But this Bodean's just wasn't up to snuff compared to the Soho one. If you're looking for good bbq, definitely go to the one in Soho, you won't be disappointed.",

I made the reservation online and requested 2 highchairs. Upon arrival, 2 booster seats were already set up. The food was really good too. Ribs were tasty and so tender, pulling away from the bone so easily. Same goes for the chicken. No complaints at all and would definitely come back again. I do have to be honest and say that the chips and coleslaw do need improving but that doesn't matter when the meat is amazing. Surprised to see that for a table of 8, the service charge was only 10%. A lot of places in London charge a lot more than this. They definitely deserve more.",

    "text": "This is a small cosy branch of Bodean's just moments from Fulham Broadway station.We shared a mixed platter for our starter which consisted of pulled pork quesadilla, wings, spare ribs , salad and lots of dips. This was a decent plate, everything was tasty and seemed good value. Could do with some nachos to mop up all the sauces.For mains, we had a pulled pork burrito which was huge but contained lettuce which went gross and soft as the burrito is also covered in sauces. Apart from that, it was tasty enough with spicy rice on the side. Definitely need lettuce and salsa on the side though.The other dish we tried was ribs and burnt ends. These were soft beef pieces which were super smoky. Ribs were tasty too. Overall the experience was good, if not outstanding. Their strong suit us definitely smoked wings/ribs & burnt ends but my favourite was the spare ribs because the BBQ thing can get get overwhelming unless you really love it, in which case, there's 2 extra BBQ sauce in the table!Service was fine, nothing too in your face which suits me. The Sunkist was draft and abit flat though. The chips need major improvement, as does the blue cheese dipWorth noting they have screens for sports and games day specials.",

The place was packed (don't come for the quiet, there's a lively, laughing, chatty crowd) , and \"Stephanie\" (I believe she was called) stopped what she was doing and met me at the door immediately with a big happy smile and found me a table. I went for the house special (\"game day\") which is ribs wings and pulled pork with side of slaw and fries with mayo and BBQ sauce. \u00a315 including a half pint of Budweiser or a soft drink. Fantastic value. A HUGE plate of food arrived and there are several different sauces on the table, along with a full new roll of kitchen roll. I badly needed this I found out later lol. They don't skimp on sauce on the wings and ribs. Couldn't fault the place. Staff very attentive and Stephanie is a credit to the place. I couldn't handle a desert with the size of the food but I'll be back :) KFC type wipes at the end really helped me not having to have a shower with the usual mess of ribs and wings + beard lol. Very, very happy. And I'm a fussy ol' fart. I eat all over the place several times a week on business. This is my new favourite food place in Fulham. Been here 3 weeks.",

The ribs were covered in too sweet BBQ sauce (think Kraft brand BBQ sauce), the french fries were soggy and stale, and the coleslaw was profoundly bland. The other elements of the place were not much better. The place is cramped, the service is not very nice, and the layout doesn't really lend itself to watching the ol' football game (if that's your thing). I remember having a much better experience at the soho branch years ago, but this place is definitely a pass...She says: Very disappointing food and ambiance. I was very excited to eat some American style BBQ and watch the football game on a Sunday night. My burger was about the quality of a diner burger in the states, with the worst fries I've had in recent memory. Some of the servers were nice but some seemed like they could care less. And the floor set up was terrible, way too many tables squeezed into a way too small space. The TV we were sat next to had the quality of an internet feed (ie: grainy and choppy). My beer was also room temperature. I will not be back.",

The atmosphere is always buzzing but it's often too busy. It's difficult to get an available table without reservation, otherwise you'd have to wait a good while.

I'll never know what led to us picking this place on a raucous Thursday / Friday night, wheeling our massive buggy into the cavernous space at the back, sitting next to a table of laddish men out for post-work beers and another table of gossipy queen bees...it was hilarious and bizarre...I was super self conscious of handling a newborn and drinking a wee bit of wine and nursing in public (under a cover) but also thoroughly enjoying the food - despite the use of only one hand through it all, I quite impressively made it through various amounts of the Bodean's sharing platter (A selection of Spare Ribs and Baby Back Ribs, Burnt Ends, Pulled Pork and Chicken Thighs), Pulled Pork Meal, Jamaican Jerk Breast, etc...the food must have been good for me to keep chugging along through that interesting evening...must defo go back more casually sometime",

    "text": "Curious about barbeque in the UK, Nava and I decided to hit up Bodean's after a Yelp event across the street. They were quite busy for a Thursday night, and took our number for a half hour wait. (Which ended up being like 10 or 15 minutes.) Anyway, I was kind of overloaded on booze already, so we opted to go straight for the main course! Nava was interested in the burnt ends and pulled pork, and I wanted to try the burnt ends and ribs. Some of the other sides looked interesting, so we opted to do some swapping and trying out things. I ended up with coleslaw and barbeque beans. Nava got chili cheese fries (because what isn't better with meat than a side of meat?) and corn muffins (because we both love cornbread and wanted to try them).The food came out quite quickly actually. Which I guess for a barbeque place isn't that surprising as most of it is already prepared. Almost everything I had was alright. Not great, not terrible. Just alright. The burnt ends were really just braised chunks of brisket. I was expecting charred ends like you would get in the states, but given that there seemed to be no actual brisket on the menu, it wasn't really all that surprising. The ribs were tender and soft, but lacked something. The coleslaw was crispy, but not amazing. The pulled pork was also nice, but a bit chewy. The barbeque sauce was fine. Nothing great. Bodean's would benefit a lot from having a range of flavors and spice levels. Spicy sauce and vinegar sauce options would really improve things quite a bit here.The beans however, they were pretty fantastic. Spicy, sweet and smoky as beans should be. The chili was also pretty great! (Although the fries under it were a bit so-so). I liked the flavor, and even though Nava swears chili shouldn't have beans, I really enjoyed it.Avoid the corn muffins. Seriously. They were boring, flavorless and chewy. Cornbread should be soft, slightly sweet and have a bit of a course texture. These were not cornbread. Not at all. I had a good time. The atmosphere is cool. You can watch American sports (if you're into that sort of thing). For the most part the food was fine. A few stand out bits, and one terrible bit, but mostly just kind of an average barbeque situation. If friends wanted to go, I'd probably go with them, but I don't think I'd go back of my own volition.(And on a completely random note, I haven't been able to get \"Is That You Mo-Dean?\" out of my head since going here. Just substitute Bodean for Mo-Dean and that's the song running through my head right now.)",

Plus, it's the only non-touristy place (re: not Sports Bar in Piccadilly) where you can watch some good ole SEC football in the fall. Bodean's has a few locations, but this one is my preferred joint, mainly because I love Fulham and it's in close proximity to many bars, grocery stores, parks, transport, and, of course, my London yoga studio. I have dragged many people with me to Bodeans, but they always leave with a smile. Good BBQ when you get a craving just does that to a person.Strangely enough, I always seem to be one of the few, if any, Americans eating here (unless there is a big game going on, but with the time difference the games don't play til late night anyway). Listening to varying English accents chatter on about pulled pork or BBQ ribs cracks me up. If you are an American in London, or a Londoner wistfully dreaming of the South, head over to Bodeans and savor the meat.",

They advertise themselves as a place to watch NFL games, but all they have are low quality illegal streams on relatively small TV's. They couldn't even shell out the ~$200 for NFL Gamepass as many other American-styled sports bars do here. The stream was lagging for most of the second half, and nothing better than what I can do on my laptop. In fact, before dinner we had a couple pints at the pub across the street that had the games in HD on big screens. Better beer selection too.We were booked for a two hour slot, 7-9PM but weren't seated until 7:15, and then rushed out before 9. The food was mostly sub-par. They gave the three of us a single large platter to share which included one extremely over cooked turkey leg, a great deal of ham (on Thanksgiving??), not enough turkey breast, dry and tasteless corn bread stuffing, decent mashed potatoes and not nearly enough gravy for 3 people. They served mostly overpriced American beer. The appetizer and desert were alright, but did not make up for the poor quality of the main course. And not really their fault, but my friend who paid the bill believes he was overcharged for the meal as well.",
