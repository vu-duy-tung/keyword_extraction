    "text": "Went there last night with my girlfriend for her birthday. We had the Korean BBQ, which was fantastic. The food was great, high quality, fresh and yummy. The service was excellent, very attentive but not in your face! We ordered lots of food and drink without looking at prices. We probably had 3 portions between the two of us and 5 beers in total and the bill came to \u00a392 incl. the service charge. I have been to Korea many times on business and Koba can easily compete. If you are looking for a cheap eat, this is not the place to go. If you compare Central London prices to Korea, you are also mistaken \u00a0after all you would not compare London prices for Thai food with Thailand either. If you are looking for a great night out, with fresh healthy food, great service and good value for money, this is definitely the place to go. Highly recommended!",

    "text": "Koba employs the modern, dark, sombre and minimalist thought in their interior design. Walking in you immediately notice the clean and distinctive lines in their main restaurant. The main restaurant seats approximately 45 people (plus a further 10 at the bar) so its also a rather intimate atmosphere. As it always seems with Korean restaurants when coming to our food selection we were almost overwhelmed by the options on the menu. However, aided by our friendly waiters and waitresses and also by suggestions from the editors of Top Table, we soon came up with what seemed like a fairly balanced meal. We started with Pajun, a Korean pancake with spring onions and seafood, and Samsaek Milssam, wrapped pancakes with meat & vegetables stuffing. Both were extremely delicious and probably just right as a starter. This was then followed by the classic Korean meal of BBQ. We were hungry so we went for the Koba Modeum which was basically a giant platter of meat and seafood. The BBQ was cooked by our waitress though I felt we had a bit of time to manage the BBQ ourselves. We also went for a noodle dish Yaki Myeon (beef noodles) which was very tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Koba with the meal without alcohol (but including service) being about \u00a330. We did have a lot of meat and seafood though so it was reasonable value for money.",

It was really reasonable and the service was great!The BBQ meat were well marinated, served raw and the waitress cooked it on a hot plate placed in the centre of the dining table. All was quite entertaining and enjoyable. One advise from me: do not wear white shirt / blouse if you are having bbq meat. The hot plate spatters gravy and juices from the cooking meat.On the whole, a place worth a try!",

Especially when your stomach needs challenge and doesn't want the same pre-cooked food as the times before. And so did I ended up in Koba for the first, and not for the last time. Not knowing of what is coming did we decided to go to this rather hidden Korean restaurant, with a menu looking as unpalatable as no other places in the area. But after looking through the windows, to discover that Korean families and business were occupying most of the places available, did we have enough assurance to go inside. At the entrance were we welcomed by a numerous amount of waiters, who sat us down straight away at the bar area. After ordering a Kimchi platter and a mixed Meat/Seafood platter for 2, did we receive raw pieces of meat and fish that was kindly, and sometimes overbearing prepared in front of us. Sitting at the bar made it possible for us not only to receive the insight of preparing the food but also to view to observe others. Which I would advice everybody for the first time to do so. All in all did we spend \u00a320 per person and received lots of Korean kindness and food that the hunter in my satisfied.",

    "text": "Koba - Pics at The London Foodie(thelondonfoodie.co.uk ) Dr G and I were recently invited by Catty of TheCattyLife to her favourite Korean restaurant Koba on trendy Rathbone Street in W1. Accompanying us on the evening was Mr Noodles of Eat Noodles Love Noodles. Having just come back from a three-week holiday in Vietnam and Korea, I was keen to find out how Koba would stand up to all the marvellous meals I had eaten in Seoul. We arrived at Koba to find a small but uncluttered restaurant, with elegant decor. The restaurant was busy with a young and sophisticated crowd. Catty took charge of the ordering, which she did expertly by choosing some excellent, unusual dishes as well as some Korean staples. We started with a portion of Pajeon \u00a0spring onion pancake with seafood \u00a37.90. This is one of the most traditional dishes in Korea, and the perfect snack to accompany chilled beers. Koba's version was fluffy, well seasoned and with a good quantity of seafood and spring onions. I normally order a spicy version with added Kimchi called Kimchi Jeon (also sold at Koba \u00a37.90, no.16 on the menu). The Japchae \u00a0stir fried glass noodles with beef and seasonal vegetables in soy sauce \u00a37.20 - was also delicious. The white sweet-potato noodles had been perfectly cooked maintaining their chewy texture, and were not overwhelmed by other ancillary ingredients. It was a well balanced and flavoursome dish although I felt that \u00a37.20 the portion was a tad ungenerous. I adore tofu and so we ordered Kimchi Tofu \u00a0steamed tofu with fried Kimchi and pork @ \u00a37.50. The tofu is steamed only and served un-seasoned. If you do not enjoy the plain, clear flavour of tofu, you will not appreciate this dish. Tofu goes really well with kimchi as they have contrasting flavours and textures. This is a staple dish in Korean restaurants and I always order it as a way of judging the freshness of the restaurant's tofu and the quality of the kimchi, two areas in which Koba did not disappoint. The star of the evening was, in my opinion, the Yook Hwei \u00a0seasoned raw beef with sliced pears and egg yolk @ \u00a38.60. This is a dish I had never tried before and is now one of my favourites, a type of Korean steak tartare. The combination of shredded beef, pears, raw egg and garlic was sensational. The meat had been semi-frozen before being shredded and tasted very fresh with the accompanying pears. A selection of barbecue meats was also ordered including: Kalbi \u00a0marinated beef spare ribs with sweet soy sauce @ \u00a38.90 were good but again I felt that the portion was not as generous as I would expect at the price. Bulgogi \u00a0marinated sliced beef @ \u00a37.90 \u00a0very delicious. Daeji Bulgogi \u00a0sweet and spicy pork belly slices @ \u00a38.60 were also amazing - the meat was tender and had been seasoned perfectly. Zzukumi Gooi \u00a0sweet and spicy baby octopus @ \u00a38.40 were an interesting addition to the other meats and worked well as a seafood choice. I was surprised to find that we had to order separate portions of Pamoochim and Sangchoo \u00a0sliced spring onion with chilli and vinegar, fresh lettuce, and seasoned soy bean paste @ \u00a33.50 to accompany our barbequed meats. This is unusual for Korean restaurants as these are normally served as part of a barbeque course. The meal would not have been complete without Bibimbap - Yook Hwei Dolsot \u00a0steamed rice and raw beef with vegetables in a hot stone pot @ \u00a39.50. This was stunning and nearly as good as the raw beef & pears dish. I was slightly disappointed that we were not offered a selection of namool (normally bean sprouts, spinach and white radish) or a small plate of kimchi as it is customary in most Korean restaurants. I found both items on the menu for \u00a35.50 each. Assa Cafe will offer the namool and free barley tea as part of their \u00a35 lunch set menu, also containing one main dish. To finish off the meal, we ordered Koba Special Ice Cream (black sesame, red adzuki beans, and green tea) \u00a35.20 while Dr G opted for Green tea ice cream \u00a33.50. While matcha ice cream is my favourite flavour, on this occasion, I felt that the black sesame ice was the most interesting of the three. Koba serves both Hite and OB, the two most popular Korean beers, \u00a33.50. We opted for beer, while Catty went for Green tea \u00a31.80. I would have ordered a bottle of soju or makgeolli (a traditional type of raw rice wine which I took a real liking to since participating at a makgeolli tasting with the guys from SeoulEats in Korea) but found that Koba prices were prohibitively high, especially considering these were all half-bottles (@ \u00a315 for the makgeolli, \u00a313 for the soju, and \u00a315 for the Bek se Ju). Service was efficient and polite but despite being attentive, it was also slightly rushed at times. A big thank you to Catty of thecattylife for taking us there and introducing us to her favourite Korean restaurant in London. Cost: \u00a3139.40 including service charge and drinks or \u00a335 per person. Likes: the most sensational Yook Hwei \u00a0seasoned raw beef with sliced pears",

    "text": "Things started by looking good, nice bar area with grills on top and the menu looked like solid Korean. \u00a0The first warning signs came when we were told that you have to purchase all the side dishes as well as the dips for the BBQ meat. \u00a0Let me explain what Korean BBQ is, in the 100's of places I've ate it around the world. \u00a0You order a number of different types of meat and then grill them yourselves, while eating side dishes (usually between 6-10) of kimchi, beansprouts, tofu, veggies, etc. \u00a0(every restaurant usually has it's own specialities). \u00a0 It also comes with a small bowl of rice and either miso or seaweed soup. \u00a0 Not in Koba - each side dish costs AND so do dips for the meat. \u00a0 I don't want to hear \"this is how it's done in the UK\" because that's a crock and an excuse to milk a few extra quid, this is how Korean BBQ is.So to the food. \u00a0 Starters were ok (jellyfish and shrimp salad was very good - while mixed Joen was a bit dull). \u00a0We then ordered mixed kimchi and \u00a0\u00a37 plate of kimchi came out ... to be fair, it tasted excellent but it wasn't enough, the lettuce cost even more as did some dips for the meat (bewildering). \u00a0 The real insult was the meat - we chose 1 order of kalbi (about \u00a39), 1 order of Ox tongue (\u00a39) and one order of chicken (\u00a38). what arrived was about 1.5 oz of tongue, under 2oz of kalbi (it wasn't even cut thick enough to be proper kalbi) and ;less than one thigh of chicken meat. \u00a0I'd estimate the chicken meat cost them 25p and they're selling it at \u00a38. \u00a0 As the meal didn't come with rice, we had a bimbimbap also, which when arrived was about 1/2 the portion of anywhere we've had it before.This meal is an insult to Korean BBQ. \u00a0 It wasn't expensive cuts of meat (I've ate and paid those prices) it was basic wholesalers meat. \u00a0We complained to the manager about the size of the meat and he actually agreed with us, told us most Korean people when they visited complained and that when he wants Korean food he goes to New Malden. \u00a0He was apologetic but refused to do anything about the bill, which wasn't really the point but I feel he's used to people complaining enough.This is a rip. \u00a0We paid \u00a380 between us (incl. 2 beers) and ended up with very little food. \u00a0The owners are banking on tourists and those who don't know better about Korean food. \u00a0 I'd urge you to avoid this at all costs and either take a trip out to where Korean people eat or try and make it at home, it's not haute cuisine.AVOID!!!",

    "text": "I love korean BBQ and I was disapointed by this one. The main reason was the really expensive price regarding the quantity of food you get.We had a mixed BBQ with different types of meat (beef, pork, chicken and duck). I was suprised that when you order a BBQ you just get the meat, and you have to order the sides (rice, vegetables) as a supplement. So in the end, the meat alone is expensive and you have to pay again for the sides.I thought the quantity of meat was just ok for 3 people, but it was good, as for the sides.The waiters were nice and attentive, but I didn't like that instead of bringing all the meat on the table and let us deal with it as we like, they brought each kind of meat separately and put it all on the BBQ. I think it spoils the pleasure of a korean BBQ which is to cook your food yourself, at your own pace! In the end, I didn't enjoy this place only because it is not what I'm used to. In the BBQ I've been to in France, there are menus with sides and often starter and/or desert included. I know that restaurants are expensive in London, but this one definitely didn't worth the \u00a330/person we paid (for a BBQ without starters or desert).",

Sad faces.Now I spot that others have said 'this is about the best you can expect in London, blah blah blah better in US... YAWN' - well that's rubbish.

    "text": "3.5I haven't tried many Korean restaurants in London, but of those I have tried, Koba ranks in the top.Koba's menu can be described as a little bit of everything Korean. \u00a0Generally, my understanding is that Korean restaurants (perhaps outside of the UK) specialize, i.e. if the restaurant does BBQ, then it only does BBQ, it doesn't sell Pajeon as well. \u00a0Still, I think it's nice that you can get a little taste of different Korean dishes in one place. \u00a0Some of the options on the menu also reflect this \"generalization' trend. \u00a0I ordered a meal that offered a bit of bbq, bibimbap, pot stickers, miso, and salad. \u00a0Everything was cooked to good standards, but nothing particularly outstanding. \u00a0The service, however, was outstanding - 5 stars. \u00a0We ordered an appetizer, and ate nearly all of it, but the last piece had a hair on it. \u00a0Of course, we pointed this out to the wait staff. \u00a0They were so mortified that they made an entirely new portion of the appetizer for us, and refused to charge us for it (we essentially got two portions for free!!). \u00a0In addition, they offered us free dessert, coffee, and tea at the end of dinner, and refused...REFUSED to accept any service tips. \u00a0We tried to tip, but they absolutely insisted that we did not leave anything. I was extremely impressed by how polite everyone was. \u00a0I will definitely be coming back here when I fancy some Korean BBQ.",

It is a fairly light, spacious restaurant with space for about 80 people in all.The staff were helpful and gracious. We ordered a mixed meat barbecue selection with was wonderful; the waiters set up our hot plates and set the meats going. They were similarly helpful with our stews and bibimbab. I love Korean food which I find perfect as a pick me up when I am feeling a little bit poorly. It is an ideal place for groups; 4-6 is ideal to get a good range of the dishes.It is not very cheap, about 20 pounds per people, but the more people you have the cheaper it becomes which suits. \u00a0There is also a decent wine and beer wine selection.Koba is a great place that is perfect for mid-sized groups.",

Definitely the best Korean BBQ I've had in London, and I daresay better than anywhere else I've tried outside of Korea. For a group of five, we ordered two trays of BBQ meatbeef, pork, chicken, octopus, prawnsfor about \u00a330 each. In retrospect, we probably should have ordered three, as they weren't terribly large and all of us left wishing that we'd had a bit more. Everything was very tender and tasty, albeit a bit on the pricey side; the poor Americans in our group almost went into shock after doing the conversion to dollars! With drinks, we spent around \u00a3100. The service we received was good. We arrived shortly after Koba opened and were seated immediately despite not having a reservation, and staff were attentive and helpful in explaining which sauces to use etc. Decor was minimalist yet comfortable and inviting. I'll definitely return to Koba again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good Korean BBQ experience in London.",

I've not found much in the way of Korean BBQ here in London and coming from a city that has what has to be the largest Korean population outside of Korea itself (and thus 5 square mile area of Korean BBQ to choose from), I was struck with how delicious and authentic tasting my meal was. I'll admit I'm a bit spoiled with Los Angeles Korean joints, who kindly throw heaping plates of panchan at you before you've even sat down for your meal. (Panchan are little appetizers that usually come \u00a0with the meal at no additional charge and may include things like fish pancakes, a couple types of kim chi \u00a0miso soup, green salad, unidentifiable fishy items and oddly, \u00a0potato salad). \u00a0Sadly, like the other Korean places I've experienced in London, Koba doesn't do this. I had to pay for my kim chi!!!! This seems unprecedented to me...However, the plate came with three types of pickled lovliess, the bulgogi was tender and succulent, the kim chi fried rice was fantastic \u00a0and our bowl of bi bim bap was heavenly comfort. 5 stars. I'll definitely be back.",

I'm still not used to having to plan so far ahead in this city. Get with the programme, GD. Fortunately for me, A Rather Unusual Chinaman, is a man with a plan, and secured us a booking at this fabulous little Korean BBQ restaurant, tucked away near Charlotte Street. The setting is clean and minimalist, detracting nothing from the food. The delicious, BBQ aromas wafting over from nearby tables had me drooling even before we ordered. Not even the fact that ARUC was drinking cocktails from a curly pink straw could distract us from the main event as plate after plate of scrumptious fare came our way. Naturally, we started with some obligatory Goona Mandoo (pan fried dumplings - \u00a35.50) - lovely. Being indecisive about which meats to order for the BBQ, we decided on the Koba Modeum Gooi - a \"grand assortment\" of meats, prawns and vegetables (\u00a323.90). Our waiter started off the cooking at the hot plate in front of us, although I think we took over as we got into the swing of things. The sirloin was smoky, tender and absolutely lip-smacking. Just as good as the BBQ was the Yookwei Dolsot Bibimbap - steamed rice with raw beef and vegetables in a Korean hot stone pot (\u00a39.20). All this was mixed in together at the table. Loved it. Finally, we had desserts - green tea ice-cream (always a favourite with me) and some weird cakey thing with green stuff in between. I can't remember for the life of me what it was, and it was fine although not really my thing. So, Koba has a new fan. I've tried a few Korean BBQ places around the West End now, but Koba is a new favourite.",

    "text": "As part of my noodle mission, I plumped for jjambong (\u00a36.50). This bowl of mixed seafood soup with udong noodles was an easy choice. Well actually it was the only choice being the only soup noodle dish on the lunch menu. I'm no expert on Korean food so I had no idea how this dish was going to turn out. Nevertheless, I was a little surprised to be served up a bowl of lurid red soup noodles. It reminded me very much of spicy flavour Nissin Ramen ! I knew this soup was going to be spicy and I admit to being a giant wuss because I thought it was too spicy. There was also an aftertaste but I couldn't work out what it was until I discovered that jjambong is a Korean-Chinese dish flavoured with doubianjiang (spicy bean paste). Now I'm sure if I were a homesick Korean then I would have loved this dish. But I'm not and I found these noodles a bit hard work. Notwithstanding the \"in your face\" spiciness and bean paste aftertaste, I realised that I'm not a big fan of thick udong in soup. I prefer thin noodles in soup and I think thick noodles work better in stir-fries. My griping aside, this was a generously proportioned bowl of noodles with lots of seafood including mussel meat, squid, and baby shrimp supplemented by a single king prawn and a large mussel on the half shell. There was also plenty of udong and veg like carrot, onions, and peppers. I liked the ambience of the restaurant and service was efficient. The special lunch menu is excellent value and my meal cost only \u00a39.30 including tea and service. Whilst I didn't overly enjoy the jjambong, there's plenty of choice at Koba and I'd like to return to sample their Korean BBQ, which looked fantastic.",

The service was excellent, very attentive but not in your face! We ordered lots of food and drink without looking at prices. We probably had 3 portions between the two of us and 5 beers in total and the bill came to \u00a392 incl. the service charge. I have been to Korea many times on business and Koba can easily compete.If you are looking for a cheap eat, this is not the place to go. If you compare Central London prices to Korea, you are also mistaken -- after all you would not compare London prices for Thai food with Thailand either. If you are looking for a great night out, with fresh healthy food, great service and good value for money, this is definitely the place to go.Highly recommended!",

He understood that food is a gateway into the soul of not just individual chefs and families, but entire cultures and stories. In this episode - he captured the feeling of Korean-Americans moving to the United States. Those hoping to \"lateral\" into American society discovered that only technical skills and knowledge as mechanics and doctors to be valued in America.Anthony discussed the Rodney King riots and how formative it was for this entire society - 25% of stores left over, 3 days of fighting, seeing everything that you've been taught about the institutions around you crumble. The narrative thread keeping this episode together - Sizzlers, Korean street tacos, soon dubu, Filipino desserts - provided a small window into the larger narrative thread of immigration to the US. I saw in these LA based Korean Americans an incredible number of parallels with my own parents in the suburbs of ATL. And throughout this whole thing, I just wanted to eat a bit of Soon Dubu.Koba is the last Korean restaurant I ate at - for the Western world, Korean BBQ is the doorway into Korean cuisine - and at Koba, it's worth a try.",

From the minute you stand in front of their door, you can already smell the BBQ which just gravitates you to step in and go inside. Like a typical Korean BBQ restaurant, the tables have grills in the middle so you can cook the food in front you. We ordered the following for two people:- Marinade BBQ selection- Lettuce and spring roll- Assorted Kimchi side salad (kimchi, cucumber, radish) - Assorted Namool side salad (bean sprout, spinach, radish)- Bowl of rice (shared) There was a lot of food, and plenty for two people. They can either cook the food for you or you can cook it yourself, and I opted to cook the food myself. Also want to add that the staff were very attentive. The marinades were very tasty and just the right amount of spiciness. A dipping sauce of sesame oil and soya sauce was also given along with a small bowl of soybean paste. I love coming here as the whole meal is just interactive and the grilling is always a great talking point! Don't dress to impress here as all your clothes and hair will smell like the wonderful grill!",

It took a bit to get flag them down for bills but I'm quite happy with the service in general. We ordered:- kimchi jigae: The flavour was ok (could be more spicy) but it was not hot enough! Very important for this stew to be piping hot. - seafood pancake: average- bulgogi: although the texture was nice, the meat wasn't marinated enough. The cabbage leaves for wrapping also costed extra, but that seems to be the norm here. - spicy pork bulgogi: nice favour and texture, probably my favourite dish- ice cream combo: really plain tasting ice cream balls, would not recommend.

So during my lunch break, 2 of my classmates and I decided to go to Koba for lunch. We were happy because we had about 2 hours for lunch and wanted to get something hot because it was so cold outside. We were seated right away. After that everything went south. We sat at our table for what seemed like ages and since we were placed in the far far corner and there was a huge group at the table next to us the service staff forgot about us. I had to wave my arms around to finally get someone's attention. After ordering our food, I ordered the korean tofu soup, we sat around for 30 minutes. People who were seated after us began getting food before us. I was so confused, we didn't even get our drinks.That made me furious...I don't understand why in the UK no one seems to care about customer service. What is that? Anyway after waiting another 5-10 minutes I got up and went to find the manager. It was ridiculous being in the restaurant for almost an hour with no food or drinks. After that we waited a bit longer and finally got our drinks. They were only okay. Then our food finally came out but we never got our baanchan (side dishes of kimchee etc.) That made me even more angry (you don't want me to be angry and hungry!). I flagged down the people and they came back and finally returned with some side dishes. The only plus from this meal was since I had complained, we were able to get a free dessert which was ice cream. Free ice cream...totally makes the asian in me a little happier. All in all this was a horrible experience and I doubt I'll be going back anytime soon.",

    "text": "This a sleek Korean place near Charlotte Street, but it can be pretty dark. It serves a range of Korean food including the popular BBQ.We started with both kimchi jeon and the parjeon. Follow by the beef japchae which I thought the taste was not as good compared to other Korean restaurant in London. The Korean fried chicken was okay but preferred other places in both texture and taste.There is a variety of BBQ meat and seafood, including platter. I find this is great when you don't know what to select or you are in a large group. We ordered the meat platter which include beef, chicken and belly pork.Prices was okay depending what you order and how much you eat. But it can get pricey especially just having BBQ which is not nesscearily filling.Koba is nice with the sleek deco but would prefer more lighting. The food was okay but feel some dishes other places does better.",

    "text": "This is my first time ever writing a review about any restaurant. Had my experience not been this horrible, I would not have written anything about this place. I WARN YOU: DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT.A little bit about me: I'm Korean, and I have been to several k-bbq restaurants in Korea. I have also been to several k-bbq restaurants in the US. But this place was probably by far the worst out of all of the restaurants that I visited. Not necessarily because of their food, but because their service was simply unacceptable.The interior design was quite nice; however, all of this is misleading, as the food is not that authentic, portions are small, and the service is just rude (even though the restaurant was mostly empty when we were there). We were seated at our table, but the waitress did not come to our table to take our order. She did not even ask us what kind of drinks we would like. She did not take care of our table well. She was unfriendly. She was also pretty bad at grilling the meat. Most importantly, SHE COUNTED THE CASH THAT WE PAID IN FRONT OF US. We were not satisfied with our service, so we did not want to pay the full service charge. We paid 3 pounds out of 5. She stared at us awkwardly, counting the money, until we paid the full service charge!!!! This is simply unacceptable. I have never had any of the waiters/waitresses count money in front of the table.I don't understand why this restaurant has such nice reviews. The food was mediocre at best. We had their kimchi jjigae, which was relatively nice, but the meat was not good at all. The meat was very thin (and very few Korean restaurants in the US or in Korea serve it this way), and I believe the pork belly was frozen meat. Just FYI, cheap bbq restaurants in Korea serve meat this thin in order to make it seem like the meat is not that bad when it's actually just bad quality meat. So this is not the way nice k-bbq should be served.For the amount and quality of the meat that they serve, the food is heavily overpriced. Do not drink any of their Korean liquor. They are also severely overpriced. 15 pounds for soju is not acceptable. It's less than 2 dollars in Korea, it's around 3 dollars in US supermarkets, and around 8 dollars at the restaurants. Lastly, charging for the lettuce and the side dishes is just ridiculous. I have never been to any k-bbq restaurants that severely overcharge you for these side dishes. These dishes should come complimentary with the meal.Overall, just bad. Took some of my friends, and I was embarrassed that I took them there.",

Both had a good amount of spicyness and flavour. We also had the beef & mustard pancake starters and the kimchee side. The kimchee was really nice, and the mustard to meat ratio was good.All in all a pretty good place. I'll probably try a few more Korean places before coming back. I did note that most of the people in there were Korean, which is always a good sign!",

I missed my tofu soup and ordered that as well. Tough it's not everyone else's fave, \u00a0I really enjoyed it. We also washed it down with shoju, which was surprisingly tasty as well. We ended our meal with a rice drink to cleanse our palate and end the night which was icing on the cake for me. I cannot wait to go back!!",

    "text": "Terrible service experience. \u00a0I felt as though our group of 8 was being completely ignored. \u00a0Considering that the majority of the entree food ordered in our group was raw (which is cooked by ourselves on the grills on the table - that part was the coolest part) it took a good hour to receive our order. Even our appetizer orders took a good half an hour to arrive. When asking for more water rather than serving everyone who was out they only refilled the person who had asked for it. \u00a0Then when I asked again (when I finally managed to flag down the waitress) for water to be refilled she completely forgot and I had to ask the bus boy for more when he finally came over to the table.By the time the orders started arriving for the grill and everyone was eating, I still hadn't received my order. \u00a0Due to food restrictions I couldn't partake in sharing the items being grilled and I waited at least another 20 minutes for my food to arrive, at that point everyone was nearly done eating. \u00a0An hour and 20 minutes for waiting for my food to be served is ridiculous and, had I not been with a group of friends, I would have walked out - and that is something I've never had the notion to do at a restaurant before. \u00a0When I received my food, that was ordered in a hot stone bowl, the bowl was hot but the food was cold and had no flavor. \u00a0I will never go here again nor will I recommend it to anyone. \u00a0I only give it two stars because, while my food was awful, the others exclaimed that they enjoyed their grilled items.",

    "text": "We hadn't been out for Korean in a while, so I was looking forward to this visit. \u00a0I learnt that Koba stands for Korean Barbecue, which is their speciality. \u00a0We built a dinner around a few barbecue choices and side dishes.We ordered some drinks to start. \u00a0We got the Bek Se Ju, a wine which we shared in shot glasses. The custom is that you don't pour your own drink, so my wife would top up mine and I would top up hers. It had a clean, floral flavour and I was drinking it throughout the meal. \u00a0I also had a Hite beer which I was craving at the end of a busy day at work.To start, we had the kimchi pancake. \u00a0It was thicker than we expected and had a nice crispy outside. There were generous morsels of seafood. The spiciness of the kimchi was present, but not as strong as I had hoped. \u00a0On it's own, this is great comfort food - I reckon I could eat three of these in one sitting.For the main part of the meal, we had three servings of barbecue: beef rib, Korean beef (bulgogi) and thinly sliced pork belly. The server cooked these for us, in that order, on the hot plate on front of us. Each was good, I enjoyed the beef rib the most. You could pick up a piece with your chopsticks and bathe it in the dipping sauce before enjoying it. \u00a0We also ordered some kimchi rice to eat with the barbecue courses.We rounded off the meal with desserts. These seemed more Japanese style to me: chestnut cake, red bean, green tea and black sesame ice creams. \u00a0They were nice flavours, but it was not too special.Total cost was around \u00a380. \u00a0That is pretty expensive, but I think the drinks pushed up the price. \u00a0I liked the setting of where we were seated: at the bar, by the entrance. \u00a0It looks like a quality place and I would be happy to return.",

    "text": "I came here with a friend on a weekday evening after work. It's quite a clean, upscale establishment with plenty of natural sunlight (extra nice for a summer evening). They don't have a website but we booked online through OpenTable. To my dismay, they don't have the free small plates of kimchi and other pickled vegetables that some Korean places give you. We ordered two starters, the japchae and a seafood pancake, which were both very good. These starters are not cheap, like 7-8 pounds each, so though we were tempted, it was hard to justify getting any more than that. They're quite large portions though, like a full plate of each, though that would have been much less exciting if it had just been a whole plate of kimchi. We then got an order of combination BBQ to share, which came with beef, pork, and chicken (though not bulgogi or kalbi, to get the good stuff you have to order separately). Each individual order of meat would have been 10-12 pounds, whereas a combo was about 25-30 pounds. The best part about the whole meal was that we didn't have to cook it ourselves - there was always a member of staff around to put our meat on the grill, turn it, cut it into bite sized pieces with scissors, and tell us when it was ready. I thought the meat was good, but since we didn't get the top quality stuff, it wasn't exactly anything special. They have some seafood options, like prawns, octopus and salmon that you can put on the grill, which I thought looked interesting. All in all, I think I enjoyed my experience at Kalbi Korean BBQ a lot more, but if you are looking for a nicer, cleaner establishment (i.e. to go on a date, or not reek of BBQ afterwards), Koba is a good bet.",

    "text": "Many of Koba's reviews say that it is exceptional, with some of the best Korean food in London. \u00a0However, after trying it out with some friends, we had a different food experience.The service is quick and the ambience is fun (good for friends, a bit loud for a date), but the food was a bit of a disappointment.First, there was no banchan!!! \u00a0WHAT???? I was so looking forward to munching on some pickled cucumbers or kimchi! \u00a0The appetizers are actually quite good, especially the beef tartare. \u00a0Even if you don't like tartare, this will be nothing like you've had before. \u00a0It's chilled to an almost frozen state, and it's sweet!But ask about the pancakes before you order. \u00a0Our \"pancake\" turned out to be tempura vegetables. \u00a0It was a bit different...The BBQ meat was an absolute disappointment - pretty much almost flavorless except for the salt and pepper rib eye. \u00a0Oh, and you must save room for some dessert. \u00a0The best are the green tea ice cream with red bean sauce and the black sesame ice cream.Overall, Koba is a mediocre, overpriced Korean restaurant... But perhaps I'm biased since I'm from the US and we get divine Korean food there for a relatively cheap price ($20-30, not 45 pounds per person thoug that's including. 20 pound bottle of wine shared amongst 3 people...).",
