Tiny windows, tiny cafe. But once again I learned that I should not judge anything by its looks.Inside the cafe/restaurant is very loud, and friendly. Always busy. It saved my morning after with a simple but big and nourishing breakfast. Definitely a feel good place with a family atmosphere. I have found myself a new local!",

The spinach and ricotta cannelloni is especially good. What I love about Pellici is that it has a great vibe in there and is fabulous for people watching. You will find yourself squashed in with every Eastend stereotype imaginable. Expect to be called Duchess and do prepared to be squashed. It is cramped and if you go at a peak time you will find yourself squished a bit, but this is part of the charm here. If ever you want to go to a proper Eastend greasy spoon, look no further than Pellici's!",

Adorable outside with its flower boxes and little house above -- rumour has it the Kray brothers rented this floor at some point in their scary career.Italien family run this place closes during the italien holidays.The food is a real mix - italien meets british meets diner.A real experience to eat here and a must see if you want to sample old world east end",

You can also smell a waking-up flavour of coffee in the morning and during lunch.It's a really small place and generaly you have to share your table with others and at peak time you need to be prepared to wait 10 or 15 minutes.You can hear the Mother from the kitchen , people will treat you very kindly and if you'll meet Nevio , one of the waiters , be prepared to laugh as he is the type of person you like to have around you.Their breakfast is famous as you can mix from a basic english breakfast any other component from an important list.Most of all it's a museum too as there are a lot of pictures around the room with famous TV's stars from the 80's and the 90's who came in.",

Still run by an East End Italian family, fine when the guy tells you all about 'Mum's minestrone' you know it's a bit fake, put on cos people lap up that kind of 'authenticity' but when he remembers you after only your first visit it is genuine and when he manages to find space for all 7 of us from work, even though it's packed and tiny, it really brings home the idea of good service. Aside from the cheeky chappy banter, which is certainly half the experience, the food is really tasty, a mix of old English caff stodge and Italian comfort food and it's pretty cheap. All meals are massive and almost all cost between 5 and 6 pounds. The lasagne is a huge bowl of cheesy deliciousness while pie and mash is drowning in gravy and broccoli cheese. The fry-ups are also enormous and cooked to perfection and they have a proper coffee machine.",

Since 1900, the Pellicci family, many of whom were born in the room upstairs, have been running this tiny art-deco cafe for locals, taxi drivers, showbiz types, and the rest of us. The breakfasts are without peer in their authenticity. It's like going home for a fry-up, with cockney-Italian banter thrown in. You can imagine Michael Caine walking in at any moment. It's tiny, but they always find room for you. You won't need lunch after breakfasting there, and you will always come back.",

It's not often you have to queue for a table at a greasy spoon but it's well worth the wait, even if it's so tightly packed you could almost pass the ketchup to everyone else in the place. With over a hundred years of history and being run by the same family, it's a unique combination of 50s Italian deco and several generations of Italo-Cockney staff - who make really make the place what it is by making you feel so welcome.This is no fine cuisine, but what they do serve - English breakfasts (& homemade chips), sandwiches and roast dinners - they do very well, especially the former. They have an illustrious list of former clients, most famously the Kray twins and I can also reliably inform that Dave Gorman is one of their many regulars - once you visit it's easy to become one (although it's not advised if you have heart problems). The impressive wood panelled interior is now grade 2 listed, unchanged since the 50s it's remarkably well preserved - but is just one of countless reasons you really have to visit Pellicci's.",

Just as some of the other review say this is a total hole in the wall, no frills establishment that been in the hood for ages. The other diners were very accommodating with a little game of musical chairs so that all the groups were taken care of. The food was homey, hearty and authentic. The best thing that we got was the lasagna, so freaking good. And I don't know if they just liked us or if everyone gets garlic bread but that was a nice touch too. There's just something about the restaurant where you can feel the warmth of being in someone's home versus being in an Olive Garden, god forbid. \u00a0The fun for us really started after the meal. I quietly went to the counter to pay while K and J were gabbing about whatever they were talking about. So I pay our tab 22 pound for the 3 of us, great deal. And after hearing the American accent, Nevio (current owner) asked me if it was my first time in East London, much to his surprise I told him it was my first time to London period which really got his attention. I think he was little confused as to how an American would come across his East London establishment. (Thanks Yelp!)So we chatted a little and what would you know, he said you have to take some of my Mom's bread pudding with you, she just made it this morning and you can share it with the girls, so of course I took him up on his offer. K was a little disappointed as she's been there several times and has never been given mom's bread pudding. See it pays to make some friendly conversation. So then he came over to flirt with the girls, telling K that maybe if she flirted a little more or smiled that she would have been given some bread pudding on her previous trips to E Pellicci. Then to top it all off we got some photos with Nevio and he was pretty stoked to show us his auto-graphic book with the celebs that have been though Pellicci. We recognized a lot of them, but we weren't familiar with some of the Brits, of course our highlight was that Ross from Friends had been in there. Talk about a fun experience all around.",

You'll probably hear those 'others' ordering plain white toast with butter (or is it margarine?) and English teas, an occurrence still incomprehensible to my Americanness (why order cheap white toast when you're out to breakfast?). E Pellici's is an informal place, a noisy place, and a reliable place for proper English breakfast food. I had beans, eggs and chips, and it was fine, nice even. It's not fabulous and not meant to be. The caff serves English pies, pasta, and other non-breakfasty items for lunch, which I haven't had so can't vouch for; but as the name implies Italian ownership, one might expect these dishes are also fine, not fabulous, and without question satiating.Service was quick and friendly, not gushy, on my visit, as it should never be in a real caff. The menu is extensive with every variation on chips, beans, eggs, back bacon, toast, fried tomatoes and margarine that one can hope for. Prices are reasonable; really, there's no gourmet goose fat fried chips and no pretention. Overall, I would go back: it's marked as my hotspot for baptising non-British visitors into the fine world of English breakfasts.",

After decades of cooking day in day out one would hope that to be the case. \u00a0Luckily for us, they have a burning passion here for making delicious food and happy customers that is palpable. \u00a0You will walk away with a huge grin and a full stomach, guaranteed!Family owned and operated, and what a dynamic and lovely family they are.Anna, one of the daughters, sat me down got me a spot of tea, and helped me to decide on the classic English breakfast. \u00a0Which is a sausage two slices of ham, a tomato and an egg on top of a piece of fried bread. \u00a0It was love at first bite. \u00a0I ate everything and was supremely satisfied. \u00a0The only sad part was that I had no room left for one final Doner Kebab before catching my flight at Heathrow! This was however a very fitting final meal in London.Not so normally reserved, I sat and took in all the sounds and smells. \u00a0The conversations between the staff and the regulars. \u00a0One of those great small moments when you feel like you've wandered into a film and are just a member of the audience. \u00a0Of course, non-participation isn't an option in a cafe which could seat maybe 25 people with 4 very active and friendly staff. \u00a0I looked on while Anna shouted orders in italian between kitchen and staff; then chatted with her customers in her lovely East London accent. \u00a0Nev, the son came out from the kitchen to have a bit of fun and chat with the customers that had come in. \u00a0 One such table were a group of Medi-Helicopter crew wearing bright orange emergency gear. \u00a0Two local brits and two observers one Kiwi and one from Texas. \u00a0Brit:\"I want you to meet my boys here they're from, New zealand and this one He's from Dallas. \u00a0Have you ever been to Dallas?\"Nev:\"No, Thank God!\" (everyone laughs) \"But I did very much enjoy watching it on the Tele growing up!\" \u00a0Ah, british humor...Anna:\"So you are here as observers, are you?\" They nod. \u00a0Well, let me tell you how it works. \u00a0You've just finished up your breakfasts and so any second now; just as it's time for the bill to come there'll be an emergency call coming in and you'll all have to leave unexpectedly!\" (laughs around) Her tone went from joking to sincere, \"Seriously though, Thank you for what you all are doing. \u00a0It's a great service that you do for everyone!\"....Seated at Another table were two female students from China. Nev greeted them with his best \"Nin hao!\" and then proceeded to ask them if they'd like to meet his Mum. \u00a0Mom of course works in the kitchen and was more than happy to stop what she was doing and say hello to the girls. \u00a0After that he began to try to convey some of the areas gangster history through broken English and hand gestures. \u00a0One theme of the morning chatter was that of the Kray brothers whom are portrayed in the new movie \"Legend\" by Tom Hardy. \u00a0According to Nev they used to come here for breakfast very regularly; and I can see why.Anna, greeted each and every customer as they arrived and as they left. \u00a0Thanking them for their patronage, and encouraging them to return with a genuine love and appreciation. \u00a0Something that was not as common as I had expected in other places I came to in London.Recognizing that I was a tourist; she offered me some free chips on the side which were fantastic. \u00a0Who is going to say no to free chips???We had a lovely chat about the U.S. and her last holiday to Florida with the family. \u00a0As I was readying to leave, paying the bill and such(which was a ridiculously cheap 6 pound and change) She insisted on giving me a slice of freshly baked bread pudding straight out of the oven by Momma herself. \u00a0I declared that I was stuffed and would pop if I took it, but she insisted and I ate it later before getting on my plane. \u00a0What a dear. \u00a0This place is a gem, not to be missed while you're in London!Cheers Anna and Nev! \u00a0Thanks for the memories.-Mr. Doug",

Way better than average \"full\" breakfast. Why? Mainly because they know how to cook tomatoes. I know it sounds silly, but they get so much flavor out of them than anywhere else. Black pudding also better-than-average.Also, I really like places that like to say \"Yes.\" This place will basically say yes to any order if they've got the ingredients. Why aren't more places like this?While the breakfast tea is, again, way better-than-average, they also know how to make a proper espresso. No visit to London is complete without a visit here.",

Each of us loved our meal, and had we been staying closer we would have probably come back. \u00a0Third, the price. \u00a0Even with the conversion rate this meal was a deal. \u00a0And the waiter even brought out a plate of chips so we could try them since his mum hand cuts them. \u00a0::SWOON::I wasn't sure if I should Yelp this place because it instantly made my \"Great Secret Places\" list, and I never want it to change. \u00a0But since I live so far away, I hope you keep it in business so I can visit it when I return.",

We happened to be staying in the Bethnal Green area and had many people recommend it to us for a traditional English breakfast, which is similar to American just with grilled tomatoes, beans, and mushroom. Upon entering it seemed very small and homey, just a few tables and a few staff. They were the nicest people! They were having loud conversations across the restaurant with guests and interacting with everyone- half speaking Italian. It made us feel like we were locals! They showed us a photo album of all the famous people that had been there before, and while leaving, the nice lady packed up some bread pudding and said that her grandmother made it this morning and sent it home with us for free! Overall I really treasured this experience and felt like I was off the beaten path and met some wonderfully friendly people!",

After searching all over for a lighter breakfast my companion and I decided that E Pellicci was the best option. We were lucky to get a table outside considering it was Saturday and the place was completely packed, which should be expected. It was one of the few places on the road that was always packed with locals whenever I passed it. The man who served us who I believe was part of the family was very kind and helpful. They only accept cash so my companion had to run down to a shop to get money out of an ATM machine. The prices are very reasonable. I had such a delicious ciabatta, fresh mozzarella, tomato and basil sandwich. It was so huge that I could only manage to eat 1/3 of it. It was nice to be able to relax and chat without having any of the staff rush us considering how popular the caf\u0117 is. Whenever I'm in London I will definitely stop here!",

The place is tiny, but the owner was all over the place, chatting with everyone and engaging in conversation. You could tell he truly loves what he does. Breakfast was delicious also, and the pasta dishes people ordered who sat a few tables over looked really good too. I wish I lived here so I could return often!",

    "text": "Really impressed with this family run homestyle restaurant. It is almost insulting when people refer to this place as a greasy spoon. It is a local restaurant with lots of regulars and visitors like us. Best of all, they treat visitors as if they're regulars. As afar as the breakfast menu goes, it can please everyone. From those who want a proper English breakfast to those like me who aren't as interested in breakfast and had cannelloni at 9:30 in the morning. Yes...breakfast and pasta can both be served at 9:30 in the morning. The cream sauce on the cannelloni was wonderful and the full breakfasts were very satisfying. Anthony Bourdain and other travel books were not wrong. Get up early and make the journey on the Central Line one stop east of the City of London to Bethnal Green and enjoy the friendly and caring service. You won't be disappointed.",

Their specials (like the chicken and bacon pie with broccoli and roast potato) are just as amazing. Completely family-run, and you can tell in the atmosphere. Incredibly efficient, too. You won't wait long for food, but expect to queue for a table during the brunch rush (esp. Saturday mornings). Worth every second of waiting. I come here as many times as I can! It's also a great way of chatting and getting to know people, as you'll never know who you'll end up sitting next to. One of the last places in London where you can have a full English and a cuppa for less than a tenner. Bravi!",

This morning we had the Full English with one order of hand cut chips, tea with milk. DELICIOUS! The owners were so nice! We stayed and had an extra coffee. While we were enjoying our coffee the homemade bread pudding came out. They gave us a serving! Delicious! Unlike American bread pudding this one is crispy and only slightly sweet. If you are anywhere near here, you need to eat here! We also saw some other tables have their pasta, looked very tasty! Thank you Pellicci family for a lovely morning!",

It seems that lots of locals frequent the establishment -- that's how you know it's good! It does take CASH ONLY, so make sure you bring money! The day we came, they were quite busy and seemed a bit understaffed, so everyone was a bit harried but friendly nonetheless. Everyone is extremely nice and the food is delicious! I ordered the full English breakfast -- because of course I had to -- and it did not disappoint. You can add-on other things as well. They have a pretty extensive menu and it's very inexpensive (I think my platter was less than \u00a36 or \u00a37). It's not fancy -- it's a very no-frills restaurant, but if you're trying to find an authentic London English breakfast experience, look no further!",

You just have to stop at Bethnal Green underground station and just walk for a mile or so in the main road.The cafe is very, very little and can be quite packed with costumers at lunch hour. I have to say that the staff (they were all part of the same family) was very friendly and engaging. They were able to speak different languages and really entertain the costumers! Even my brother accidentally encountered the grandmother of the owner - who also happens to be the chef of the restaurant - and they even had a little chat together. I will never forget the service!The food was excellent. We all ordered the full breakfast which tasted like no full breakfast I've tasted before. Everything looked fresh and cooked to perfection. The apple crumble and the black coffee were also delicious.At the end of our meal, the waitress gave us a slice of home made cake her grandmother made specially for new costumers. She said we should try their freshly made pastas the next time we eat there. I can't wait to eat there again somewhere in the future.Overall, this is a very authentic and genuine place to eat Italian food in London, and the prices are reasonable. Highly recommended to anyone visiting the city.",

As the waiter/cook/son of one of the chefs told us, this place blew up in popularity after Anthony Bourdain mentioned it in his London episode of The Layover (S1E9). However, when Bourdain sits down to eat eggs on fried toast, it's actually at a different place, which is a bit misleading. I can see why though - E Pellicci is a bit on the small side, but not without charm. It's been around since 1900 and it has a hand-carved wood interior. Luckily for us, there's also outdoor seating (about 5 tables). We went with the modestly priced full English breakfast (which included white sausage, bacon, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, and a fried egg on fried toast) with the addition of black pudding. With a cup of tea, it totaled just 7 GBP. A fine deal. The sausage and the mushrooms were the best parts, but be warned - you definitely need to come hungry because it's a hefty meal. Not for the faint of stomach.The employee who I mentioned earlier (Liv) also struck up a conversation with us about America and NYC, and would not let us leave without a generous sample of his mom's bread pudding. Super nice guy. I wish them continued successes well into the future!",
