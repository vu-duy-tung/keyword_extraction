I thought the best from the grocery store was as top shelf as they get, until their simple bread and homemade olive oil. That being said, they also offer a unique range of high quality wines, food, and even cola. The restaurant can be pricey, but it has always been a lovely meal. The place has charm (it hasn't adopted the chain pub feel of some of the Upper Street bars), they are eco-conscious (they have quite high food morals and generate their own electricity), and is quite gastro without being pretentious. It's best to book to eat in the restaurant.",

The Duke of Cambridge is one of the few places I have found that actually practices what they preach. You won't find your typical fish options on the menu here because they are species that are overfished. Instead, the Duke of Cambridge picks more unusual species that are abundant and sources them responsibly. The night we went, the menu was constantly changing as the kitchen ran out of something and substituted something else. To me, this is the sign of a good kitchen. The food is tasty, and you can feel good about any choice you make off their menu. The only thing that was somewhat disappointing was the service, which was brusk and flighty. They forgot one of our meals, but they did quickly bring it out and offered a free pint in compensation (pretty impressive to me). A really great, special place in London.",

There are some nice benches out the front to have a drink and a smoke, or you could sit inside in the main bar room if you are having a drink with friends. There is also another room which houses the main dining area and looks equally nice for a meal with friends or something more romantic. While I didn't have any of the food when I went - it all smelled delicious and I have no doubt that it tasted the same. The drinks that we tried were lovely and the prices were amazing for such a nice looking place, providing organic drinks, in a great location. The whole place looks really nice, is just enough off the beaten track to be calming and very reasonably priced. I would highly recommend it.",

Oddly, the pub is known as a food destination, but actually excels as a drinker's hangout (in the non-dodgy sense). A fantastic organic beer list and a number of comfortable chairs and tables in a very bright and bewindowed bar area make for an excellent lounging experience for reading or catching up with friends.

I think this pretty much sums up my last dining experience at The Duke of Cambridge. I booked a last minute table for a rather large group (17) for my birthday celebrations at the end of July and although I was nervous as to whether I'd done the right thing, I shouldn't have been. I've been to \"The Duke\" a few times before with my partner, but never with a group and I couldn't have asked for better service and attention for my special day. Nothing, and I mean \"nothing\" was too much trouble for the staff. I had a couple of extra friends who arrived on the night who I was worried may not have been able to be accommodated, but again, I needn't have worried. I just had to mention a couple more people had joined us and our waiter and waitress were on \"it\", shifting place settings and adding extra chairs. The attentiveness and level of swift service continued well into the night, ensuring everyone was free to enjoy the company of others they'd not met before or seen for a while. It's very rare I'm able to get a big group of friends together for my birthday as it usually falls when everyone is on holiday, but this time I did and the folks at The Duke made sure we all had a great night. Thank you The Duke of Cambridge staff. We'll be back with more friends soon!",

There were fliers on all the tables and a huge billboard near the toliets detailing how they were going about making the world a better place. They lobby for environmental laws...how cool is that?Did not try the organic food, but was a bit too pricey for my tastes. \u00a316 for a curry? Um...no thanks. I'm sure it's amazing but for that price, the curry had better be straight from Mumbai. Okay, and I don't like Curry. Maybe I'll try one of the nibble plates next time (because there will be a next time, soon I hope!) and update on how it is.It was summed up best this way: If Whole Foods opened a bar, it would be the Duke of Cambridge.

If I walk in and say hello to the guy standing with the reservation book in his hands, is it really too much to ask that that person says hello back rather than stares at me and says absolutely nothing? And when I point out our reservation etc, he just generally waves us across the room rather than shows us to our table (we had to ask as there were several empty spots).A different waiter also fell into this category, but things were saved somewhat by our hard-working waitress who eventually cracked a smile and was very efficient. (Perhaps bring more staff in on busy evenings?)I think we would have had a different experience had it not been so rammed. The three of us agreed that with so much choice around this neck of north London we probably wouldn't give this place a second chance based on our first impression. My favourite (although not organic) for quality and service remains the Albion where I have yet to have a bad meal.",

We walked in on a full night, without a reservation, and with the tables up front packed with parties who appeared to be holding firm for the night. A server suggested there'd be no more openings (at all?) but we convinced a family of three to let us join them. Another server stopped by shortly after we shimmied ourselves into the reaches of family's table, soothing the mortification of their son who was appalled by his parent's agreement with us, to let us know a table had freed up. And then the magic began. The vibe was ideal: rustic & unpretentious decor, warm lighting, low-key crowd, the wine and beer list appealing, and service relaxed but knowledgable. Started with sparkling and a simple but ridiculously good appetizer of bread with a garlicky spread. Each entree was unique and definitely enjoyed, if not the star of the show (that was the fig sticky toffee pudding... Seriously, we're debating writing into Bon Appetit to see if they'll get the recipe for the greater good of the world).",

    "text": "Everything is organic here. This gastropub is the only gastropub to be certified by the Soil Associationwhich creates more questions than it answers. What is the soil association, how does one join (curiosity, not ambition) and are enough people really that passionate about soil that an association was justified. Clearly the food is the main purpose here, but their dedication to the organic and local means that they have a fairly unique (and enjoyable) selection of drinks on offer. It's a little bit more expensive than you might hope, but that's expected in such specialist establishments. I shall try and come back for the food sometime!",

    "text": "It's hard deciding where to eat when you have such a wealth of choice in a place like Angel, however I strongly recommend this little gem just off the main high street. Everything and I mean everything, from the entire food and drink selection down to the tampon machine in the toilets, is organic - and what they do they do well. A vast bar and restaurant area houses beautiful big wooden tables (for that true rustic 'could be eating in a forest type feel'), and a fantastic atmosphere \u00a0I think it's that feeling everyone has when they know that fundamentally they are doing something good \u00a0like eating wholesome organic food as opposed to a McDonald's. I ordered vegetarian chilli and a glass of house red, both excellent, and my brother enjoyed a steak and ale pie which he said he had already had 3 times but kept coming back for more, surely a good sign. Don't be put off by the price and remember it's more expensive than usual because of how the produce is sourced \u00a0when I left I felt like I should become like Barbara Good and embark upon the whole self-sufficiency thing, then remembered I wanted a new pair of shoes and a holiday!",

Although they do not take reservation in the bar area the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful by pulling some tables together for me. The service was outstanding and the selection of wine and spirits very nice (loved the eco warrior beer) albeit not very cheap. The food was fantastic as well, their awards thus rightly earned. The pub has a nice urban charm to it with rustic tables and chairs and candle light everywhere as soon as it gets dark. No music or telly, so nice for talking! The usual crowd seems very friendly as well. There is a bar and a restaurant area.The only downside my friends and I could find was that the lack of fabrics in the room made it quite loud at times. Still, 5 stars for an awesome location.",

    "text": "Nowadays we all know that organic food and drink is better for us, better for the environment and better for the produce that we eat while it's alive [and I'm not just talking about the meat and fish, oh no, I've heard that organic carrots are much happier to be pulled out of the ground and eaten than their non-organic counterparts who leave the earth screaming and weeping], so this gastropub which has been selling solely organic food and drinks for the last ten years has a great gimmick. But it's not just the fact it's organic that makes the Duke of Cambridge worth a visit; There's also the fact that the food tastes great, the wine list is brilliant, the service is always fantastic and the atmosphere is lively and yet relaxed. Let's talk a bit more about the food; The menu's displayed on a big blackboard in the main pub area- you can also sit in the quieter restaurant area in the back, although reservations are usually required for this space- and changes daily depending on what the chefs have in stock. It's very seasonal and always has a few veggie options as well as massive hunks of organic meat with various accompaniments, and there's usually about half a dozen options for each course. The prices are quite high, but the quality really does show in the produce used, and every time I've eaten at the Duke I've only managed a main course and a shared pudding as the portions are very generous. On sundays they serve a roast as well as the other options, and there are also bar snacks on the menu like olives and nuts. The drink: Well, obviously it's all organic, and aside from the aforementioned brilliant wine list [I heartily recommend the Xarello to any white wine drinkers by the way, it's a Spanish white that's really grapefruity and fresh, yum], with quite a few wines by the glass, there are juices, beers, ales, and really fantastic strong coffee. The water comes in jugs filled from a special machine which filters tap water to make it pure and removes all traces of the usual London tap water contents. As I said the staff here are brilliant, very funky, very attractive, knowledgeable about all aspects of the menu and the drinks list, and most of them have been working there for years which makes this a bit different to your local pub. In the summer you can sit outside and have a drink or a meal, and any time of year it's a great choice for a relaxed beer or dinner.",

    "text": "I remember when this organic pub first opened years ago and I've been a customer ever since. There's a fantastic selection of organic wines, beers, ciders, spirits and cordials on offer. When you're feeling full of cold and unable to face alcohol, I recommend a hot elderflower cordial. Otherwise, there's a very good English white wine which is very dry with quite a flowery flavour. I love it, but it may be an acquired taste if you're used to mass-produced chardonnay. It used to be called Horsmunden, but has now changed its name. Luckily the waiter knew what I was on about and brought it anyway. Also great is the Luscombe cider. The food is also organic, but a bit more hit and miss. Check out the regularly changing blackboard, but order early as they cross more and more things off the menu as the evening progresses! You can choose to eat in the restaurant bit with waiter service (and service charge!) or in the main pub on the big chunky tables, which is a bit more relaxed (and cheaper!).",

I went here for a birthday, we wanted a nice good pub where we can eat better than the average pub bad stuff.And at the end... it was good! really good! BUT not enough to deserve 4 stars unless...The place looks like a usual pub, tables, bar, usual stuff. Behind this curtain there is a nice and small restaurant where they actually serve proper food (read: appetizers, mains, desserts and everything else you people love).We had duck liver as appetizer, a good portion, while a friend of mine had scallops... NO, really no. 2 very small, lumpy pieces on a green sauce, definitely a wrong dish.The main was HUGE, but again with a problem: while ours (sunday roast) was enormous, well done (maybe a bit overcooked for my tastes, but that's me being a boring picky person, not them), full of flavors and everything else you can imagine, the fish (in the specific, salmon) was again wrong: small, unflavored, with almost no garnishment. Pity.Nice \u00a0addon: coffee is served in a huge moka, italian home supper style!In conclusion, it's a nice place, but they should do easy stuff, roasts etc, DO NOT go on fancy stuff because they can't do them. It's a nice place for everybody, if you care about organic food and drink then it becomes one of the best places where to go in London!",

It was also one of the more unique dishes I've had in a pub as of late.And if you've just come for a drink, the real ale selection and extensive organic wine list is sure to please.

The outdoor seating was nice on a warm Sunday evening.We drank in the bar section until the restaurant opened at 6:30 PM. The blackboard was filled with interesting dishes. I went for the beetroot gulash and I am not a fan of beets, but I love gulash. The waiter assured me it was the same spices as beef gulash. I was surprised when it arrived as there were beets, kuskus, creme fresh, and a salad in one bowl. Maybe one of the best meals I have ever eaten.The cheese plate was nice, the cider was nice, but also not so flavorful, and the oatmeal, ruhbarb crumble was delicious. I want to go back every season to try all of their dishes.",

I also ordered a cider was tasty and flat! none of this strongbow fizzyness which does not even taste like apple. the selection of ciders here is great, not a beer fan so did not really look into that.They can also give your dog a bowl of water if you ask.

The problem arises when one of the most expensive roasts you can have doesn't even make the top 20 roasts I've eaten at other, better (and cheaper) establishments in London.We ordered the roast pork, the meat was tender if a little dry but the sides it came with were ordinary to below average. Two potatoes, a sprinkling of soggy greens and apple sauce that looks like it came out of a baby food jar (organic no less I'm sure).If you want a good roast, look around on the internet - there are a ton of better places to go that won't cost as much. Just because it's organic doesn't make it better, I would have happily paid the \u00a320 for this meal if it was nearly as good as some of the better roast lunches I've had in other establishments.This place fell well short of my expectations for a Sunday roast, perhaps a better place to come to enjoy the atmosphere and organic beers as these were really great.",

So next I tried the Freedom Dark Lager and this has become my drink of choice in the Duke of Cambridge. Every time I'm in the area I try and make a point of visiting the Cambridge to try the Dark lager! The beer is expensive (over \u00a33.50 a pint) but it is very good.The atmosphere is nice. The building is nice and airy and the staff are friendly enough. There is also a nice outside area which is good in the summer.Food wise - I refuse to try the majority of it. Yes it's organic, but they are trying to charge restaurant prices in a pub. I'm not paying over \u00a35.00 for soup thank you. The bar snacks, however, are decent value. I think it's around \u00a33.50 for hummous and toast and it was enough for me and my girlfriend to share. We do like a nice snack too!Overall, if you like your beers try and the Duke of Cambridge.",

I love food that is good for me, that is bad for me, I just appreciate the fine art of cooking, be it my cherubs pasta sauces, or St.John's lovely offal to malaysian street food.But I have to say as much as I love food and eat pretty much everything, my first foray into organic food was at the Duke of Cambridge.And I have to say it was not just lack lustre is was plain old boring ! Really I am vegetarian friendly, hey I can cook up a vegetarian feast !My best friend and fav cousin are vegetarians (and i know that has nothing to do with this pub). But I must cement my position before I comment on this pub !The Food: which the primary reason why I went there was .........boring !The daily menu is put on a blackboard. Most of the diishes on offer are vegetarian and seem to involve quite an array of sauces and vegetables.But alas the dish that I finally settled on was a venison tagine that was served with a jeweled couscous and kale. it arrived in a record time of 7 min....and sadly was tepid !The couscous was luke warm, but well flavoured and could have done with a blast in the microwave if i where home, but I was not !!I was in a blasted restaurant !!The tagine was sadly over spiced, i could taste the cumin, cinnamon and spices used that masked the meat !My friend ordered a crabcake which was served with barbecue sauce !!the crab cake had very little crab and more potato, but this maybe because it was drowning in a barbecue sauce !!I lived in Maryland and am experienced with crab-cakes !! i have never had them served with bbq sauce, its too overpowering and is a rookie mistake !!Sadly after the main courses i could not get myself to order the desserts which looked tempting ! I have a feeling i will not be visiting this establishment again !",

Might be a bit too much for some people to take but I thought it was great that they have done so much and of course they should shout about it, it's something to be proud of. The pub has high ceilings and large tables so great for groups. Beers and wines all reasonably priced. And yes the bar staff do seem particularly hairy, something that comes with being a hippy perhaps? Now to the food, I know it is expensive (my main meal (\u00a315), starter (\u00a37) and a couple of beers plus tip came to \u00a335) but it is good quality, ethical food and yes that does come at a price. Unfortunately we are all used to the 2 chickens for \u00a35 prices of Tesco or the burger king meal for under a \u00a35er. But if you have an eco head on you or you just care where the food comes from then it is worth the price tag. It was fresh, tasty and well presented. For a special occasion you can't go wrong. We all deserve a treat now and again right? So enjoy.",

That's right, everything is organic from all the food ingredients to the wine!It is a wonderfully homely place, and if you come on the weekends, be sure to be there earlier if you want to get a seat. The atmosphere is just delightful, and fills up with many of the fashionable locals of the area. There is a little dining area tucked to the right side of the place when you enter, but I much prefer the main room as though not much different from the dining area, the feeling is just more informal. The interior is filled with a random mix of different styled wooden chairs and tables, which work very well together, adding to the warmth of the place. The dishes are filling and served in large portions. There is always something different on offer, as the menu changes constantly, and mostly importantly, the individual ingredients are freshly picked on a seasonal basis. Before you order you are given a bowl of home made bread, which taste great dipped in the olive oil provided. I can never resist the menu, with such things on offer as ' Jerusalem artichoke and apple soup', mutton, mushroom and red wine stew with braised pearl barley and curley kale', and 'sticky toffee pudding with butterscotch sauce'. The randomly mixed use of ingredients is just impeccable, I can't wait till I next go now as it has been ages!",

It's a neighborhood pub and I absolutely love it! The pub is candlelit with old wooden tables and plants in every corner. I love the decor and cozy vibe that you get from the moment you step in. They have a small menu featuring local and organic food, alongside local beer and cocktails made from fresh pressed juice. I ordered the lamb sunday roast which came with a variety of vegetables, potatoes, and yorkshire pudding. The roast was very tasty but a bit undercooked for my taste. Regardless, the meal was very filling and perfect after a long day of traveling. If I lived in East London I would be back in a heartbeat!",

Kid (scratch that -- BABY friendly with lots of buggies even at 9pm Saturday night) though I wouldn't say it's the easiest place to bring the babies with the narrow aisles, uncomfortable old school farm tables squished together and the like. I left mine at home and had a great time - ha! Seating in the front area is first come, first serve and patrons order at the bar. As we were without a reservation on this particular Saturday evening, we opted for a table near the door, got a great meal and a few drinks and were really happy. If you don't want to take your chances, make a booking -- this place is popular. Menu rotates daily. I've had two dinners here and really enjoyed both -- inventive yet comforting. The venison and beetroot salad was memorable on my last visit, as well as those beautiful delicious glasses of red wine I indulged in. It's just a stone's throw from busy Angel/Upper Street, but on a nice residential street. Tucked inside it looks like a larger traditional pub but their commitment to local and organic puts them quite a bit above standard pub fare. The secret is out, but its still good fun. Chances are you'll see a few babies and buggies so if that doesn't bug you, you'll likely enjoy.Main takeaway - make a booking.",

This is a solid, upscale neighborhood pub.What really seemed odd in a pub, was to be charged shy of three pounds for the bottle of tap water they placed on our table with four empty glasses. \u00a0A crew of regular patrons were surprised and bristled when the bill came, mumbling it was not great hospitality, and I suppose I can see their point.",

Every single thing was delicious. The mustard sauce was a bit on the cool side, but still very flavorful. The bowl of soup is seriously a large bowl, so be forewarned.Accompanied by a couple organic colas like proper hipsters, it was a perfect lunch.The service was lovely. I wish I'd gotten his name, but he warmly tolerated my American jokes and responded in a charming Irish accent. So dark-haired Irish accent guy, you were aces.I'd give it five stars, but it was a tad on the pricey side. I appreciate the effort and work that goes into it and the labor involved in quality organic veg, so it didn't pain me, but \u00a313 for egg and potato is a little high.

That's right - everything from the various beers on tap to the wine to the food offering. \u00a0They have a full pub menu that is updated on a daily basis; their menu changes depending on what season/ingredients they have.The pub itself is quite spacious. In fact there is an open seating area with ample places to sit as well as a more formal sit down area which can be booked out. \u00a0The toilets are on the lower ground floor - reason I call this out is there is a board in front which has a map of the UK and the various farms/distributors the pub gets all their food/wine/beer from. \u00a0Quite cool to know where exactly your food is coming from.In terms of the food, they have lots of selection. \u00a0This place is definitely more gastropuby and the prices of their dishes reflect it. \u00a0I've been here for food before during the week, however, this time I came here on a Sunday so I can have a nice Sunday Roast. \u00a0I got the Venison Roast. \u00a0the meat was a bit fatty but worst part is...no Yorkshire pudding! \u00a0That's the best part! \u00a0Wasn't really impressed. Minimal sides as well and only a few roast potatoes. at \u00a319.50 it was too expensive for me, even for being organic.All in all, it's a good place to get your organic fix. They're support local farms and markets and do good food - just don't expect your roast to come with a Yorkshire pudding.",

This time round we came with colleagues from Singapore and the US, to give them a taste of Britain.The organic wine and beers were widely enjoyed, and so was the food, with delicious scallops for starters, and then some nice piece of lamb for mains.The rabbit, however, was a bit dry and over-cooked...However, my colleague's fish was incredibly tender and juicy. A must !!!",

    "text": "We had a \"couples lunch\" here on a Sunday, one of the couples was a local and had been before and recommended the establishment.The venue is pretty rustic with sanded wooden tables and mis-matched chairs this follows through to the cutlery which is also mis-matched but in that cool way. The staff (of which there is a lot!) were quick to serve is and friendly enough. The food is all written on the board and is all organic.... I'll give it, it's dues for organic food it's not too badly priced (\u00a318 for a decent size main). Between the group we had four different meals, roast pork, roast Lamb, fish and chips and a grilled fish. My fish and chips was ok, but the batter was a bit heavy and soggy on the bottom. The roasts looked good and were certainly big portions but weren't \u00a0the most visually appealing I've seen. The lamb had no complaints and I thought the grilled fish actually looked pretty good.As a pub, there were a very good selection of both organic ales and lagers and they were even selling mulled wine.... Which apparently needed more sweetness.Definitely pop in for a drink as it had a good atmosphere and was obviously not good enough for the A list celeb I spotted in there.",
