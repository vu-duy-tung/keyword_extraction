Well, maybe you have just 2---Ikari and Tenshi if you don't fancy conveyor belt sushi.Tenshi serves reasonably priced and well prepared sushi in an intimate and popular restaurant right on Upper Street near the Green. \u00a0Now that I've been here and to Akari---I must say I'm a bigger fan of Akari--the food is more inventive there and the atmosphere (a sushi pub!) is much hipper.However, Tenshi does gets points for the quality of the fish (I enjoyed both my seared tuna hand roll and my salmon teruyaki), and the gyoza---perfectly made and not overly deep fried. The location is much handier than Akari's--here you are moments from Angel station. I did deduct 1 star though as they were out of many items I wanted (no salmon skin rolls, no beef of any kind), what a disappointment.That said, the quality is A-Ok and location is great. So 3 stars it is.",

The menu has a good range of appealing yet straightforward Japanese dishes with a good range of sushi items (several roll types and nigiri) and decent selection. Udon and yaki-soba noodle dishes and tempura plus rice based dishes, katsu, curry and teryaki.I ordered a range of sushi and it was really good and fresh.Prices were reasonable AND the quality was there. I've been to more expensive sushi places that weren't as good.Will definitely be going back for more!...",

No - they're not what you think! They're the famous Japanese takoyaki - lightly griddled balls of batter filled with bits of octopus. Absolutely delicious at Tenshi and probably the best I've ever had in London. Apart from that - pretty standard fare at pretty standard London prices. The London Insiderlondon-insider.co.uk",

    "text": "A new sushi place? In Islington? FIRST! Sorry, apparently even on Yelp you get internet douchery. Once we heard there was a brand spanking new restaurant on Upper Street, Laura N. and I put on our sushi eating pants and headed right over. Tenshi (that means angel in Japanese.. get it..cos it's in Angel. Clever devils they are) is a nice place, a bit spartan when it comes to decor but let's call it sushi house minimalism. Laura was excited to see they had okonomiyaki on the menu but decided to keep it simple with salmon sashimi. I ordered my usual and we waited in anticipation.And waited. Rip Van Winkel waited less time than we did. They didn't even bring the edamame or the green tea. Nothing. For a long time. Finally I got my agedashi tofu and L got her salmon. But nothing else.. for an even longer time. We began to wonder had we annoyed them in some way (maybe they'd heard of us, Laura N. is big in Japan you know). Both of us are fairly laid back but this was ridiculous. Turns out they had forgotten the edamame but that doesn't explain why it took so long for my maki rolls. It's raw fish.. how long do you need to make it?Tenshi gets three stars because the food was very very good. L claimed it as soon of the best sashimi she'd ever eaten. Slow slow refills of the green tea and they never once came over to ask were we okay or to explain the delay. But they are new and I would definitely give it another chance.",

And although the most densely populated area by dining institutions in London, it can be a challenge to find a decent bite without pre-booking at \"rush hour\".However, Tenshi to the rescue. Nicely timed after returning from a Japan trip and missing the tasty cuisine I had been treated to there, I thought I would give this place an opportune visit, after all they did have space for us (wich I can say did cause a little suspicion initially, now I appreciate that they have cunning kept their profile on the DL from Islington savages).Friendly and polite staff which made a good start, who didn't even kick us out when evidently they had packed up the kitchen and closed (- the Japanese are way to polite!) The sushi platter was fresh, and the noodles very tasty - and I couldn't believe how reasonable the prices were! I'd definitely think twice about going to Wagamamas next tie a craving for yaki udon arises, not only to support a local business but to sample some of their curry and rice options next time too. Might give the awfully saccharine plum wine a miss and just stick to the Asahi next time though!",

Granted, guilt stars have been heavily played in my book of late... The staff are just so sweet, I want to hug them with big anime grins and squeals! Not only do they serve me delectable raw morsels, but they are willing to humour me with my few lines of Japanese ('wow, your country is beautiful' and 'do you take credit cards') and pretend they understand what I'm saying.All win.",

The takoyaki octopus ball starter was ok, the fried octopus tenacles was tough though. The mixed sushi platter was mixed. It depends on what your comparing it to. If your comparing it to Yo! Sushi then it's probably good but I was personally underwhelmed. On the plus side I thought the tempura was good especially the vegetable elements as they were fresher. I feel really terrible for saying this as I want independents to do well. But there were too many little things that were quite right but with a few minor improvements I think this could be a good 4 star restaurant. For example, they appeared to use a communal teapot with old green tea leaves for serving tea to customers. The tea had very little flavour at all. It would be nice to have our own fresh teapot...I'd be happy to pay \u00a32-\u00a33. One last thing to mention - they appeared to have a very good sake and shochu selection but unfortunately I was driving.",

Not the most amazing thing ever, but distinctly solid. That combined with the location and the atmosphere = a solid 4 star sushi place. I also had the Tako balls (octopus) which was pretty much as I've had them other places. They also have Okonomiyaki (youtube.com/watch?v=PeUH\u2026) which I'll have to try at some point. In short, not REALLY worth the price, but solid if money isn't a huge issue for you.",

The Sashimi was not bad but certainly not great, a couple of the bits of Tuna and a piece of salmon were a bit stringy, certainly not top notch. My pork Katsu curry was alright, better than Wagamama but that's not exactly an endorsement. The prawn tempura was delicious though so I'm sure with a bit of wading through the menu you would probably stumble on some gems. That is if you had the time or the inclination to do so. I for one can't be bothered, especially when there are so many great Japanese restaurants in town that do it all well. The service was hit and miss too, I feel bad saying this as the girls in there were all very friendly but it was a constant battle to catch their attention. The table next to us had their main arrive before their starter, they complained, it was removed, and 5 minutes later it arrived back in the hands of another waitress alongside the starter. Finally, and this one is just a bit odd, definitely the fault of the chef and not the waitresses. Our Sashimi order was messed up (it had an extra portion of seabass) after we had eaten half the waitress apologised and said she had been ordered by the chef to remove it and give us the proper order. She dutifully did this and gave u another, virtually identical (but now replenished) platter of Sashimi. We weren't charged any extra so I'm not complaining, but it seems to me that this only serves to put them further out of pocket. We hadn't even noticed the mistake and were happy to eat it as it was, very odd. Even the lure of another potentially favourable and slightly Basil Fawltyesque kitchen episode still doesn't inspire me to return though unfortunately.",

The soup was just average, not many toppings.The food quality was okay but I left slightly hungry so would have been better to go with the Tenshi bento, as that was a bigger box and assortment.

Immediately as we sat down we asked for some salty edamames a couple of Kirin pints and a ramune (Japanese soft drink), which came after 5 minutes, everything was good by then, at the same time we placed our second food order immediately.Notably we were the second table to arrive and the first to order, obviously after the first table that was there. Quickly diners were came in and sat down on the rest of the available tables, however, we were perplexed to see how they served others before us, leaving ours last in the requested order, while this was happening, we tried to call the attention of the staff without any success, I ignore if they were ashamed for their mistake or if they were just so stressed running up and down that gave them no time to look at our upraised hands as if we were in a 80's rock ballads concert, we were just missing the lighters to hold them on.When finally the waiter approached to our table, we asked him if everything was all right, he answered in a very quickly way \"sorry, usually sushi takes times\", and left without giving us the time to tell him back that all of the tables ordered after us and they were already eating sushi... They were not interested about us at all, but believe me, if I did not call the waiter to see what was going on, it could take more time.We were very patient and we decided that this negative detail would not embitter our family Sunday, however after half hour the waitress came with a simply apologize and one of our dishes, a pork okonomiyaki, one of my favorite Japanese dishes, let say it was well done, it may be taken longer because it was on the verge of cooking, almost burned, if I forget for a moment about this unpleasant taste, was very good, although I would have preferred that they charged me a little bit more to enjoy more sauce, it was poor in this matter, I appreciated the nice touch of katsuobushi or bonito flakes, but not so the huge pieces of ginger randomly distributed in the filling that surprised us occasionally with every bite we took.After receiving the okonomiyaki, the waitress found out my anger and began to get us the rest of the dishes, a tonkatsu pork, past frying oily thick hard pork cuts, my daughter's favorite dish unfortunately she was unable to eat it. I imagine because it was Sunday, they had run out of sauces, or they were carefully measure them, because otherwise I can find no other explanation why they did not served they way it supposed to be, and in case you were wondering, yes, it was missing a lot of sauce. \u00a0The tuna and salmon hosomaki, at least they were tasty, well-proportioned, the rice was well-seasoned and at the correctly temperature as well, although its presentation was not the proper one.The idea was to order dishes very slowly, but seeing the situation regarding the service and the preparation of dishes we decided to leave, but took us another fifteen minutes to just ask for the bill, while the table remained full of empty dishes. I took the option of get down to pay, while my family waited for me upstairs. \u00a0While I was asking the check to the welcome waitress I also absurdly asked for the manager, obviously he/she was not in the restaurant, otherwise I can not explain such a disaster, but to top it off, after paying, I was stopped by another stressed waitress, apparently she thought and kindly let me knew that I was leaving without paying, it was really uncomfortable being observed suspiciously by almost all the staff.Rarely happen that I left a restaurant altered, this time was one of them, because of a really globally negative experience, mostly they did everything wrong.",

Their sushi's not the best (the tuna ones are usually a bit dry as the tuna isn't fatty enough to make it truly good), but there are a few items on the menu that are definitely worth a try! I would definitely recommend you order the chicken gyoza, as they are the best I've ever had in London. The miso soup is also really good. Service wasn't really great in the past but it seems it has improved significantly lately. Also a brilliant place for takeaway (they always tell you there'll be about 15 minutes wait but I don't think I've ever waited that long).",

We had two sides of edamame beans, which I'm sure was my first and definitely won't be my last! They were so morish! We has ice cream too - I choose the green match tea, which I really enjoyed. Service was good, maybe a little slow but friendly and attentive. They were quite busy for a Monday night, so that's a good thing for a business I think.

Not that bad, but if you want privacy and not having to constantly eavesdrop, then maybe go elsewhere.The sushis were pricy for the amount, so I didn't order a starter. Now reading most of the reviews here I'm glad I didn't.Staff was attentive and pleasant, the meal came fast. Ordered a couple of pints of Kirin, came to the table not exactly cold but acceptable. The pork curry katsu: the swine meat wasn't best quality, very stringy and hard. The breaded bits were falling off. The sauce was different than any japanese curry I've ever had, here or in Tokyo, and not for the best. It was served on a plate when I believe curry is best served (for handling purposes) in a bowl. The flavour didn't blow my mind at all. Good location, prices are overall right, service is decent. The kitchen needs to up their game.",

We showed up around 6:30 pm when this place was starting to get busy. We opened the door and immediately, a waitress said \"we are full\". I was anticipating she would say something else like how long is the wait time, where can we wait at, etc. But she didn't say anything. I asked her how long should we expect to wait. She said she doesn't know. Probably 15 minutes. We waited outside the front door in the rain for 5 min. I decided to check back with them to get a more accurate estimation.I walked in, and got ignored by 3 waiters who were passing right before me. They acted like they didn't even see me there. I had to stop the 4th one. Before I even said anything, the lady said \"no tables here no tables here\", and then she started to walk away again. At that time I was furious. I have never seen any restaurant being so rude to potential customers. But I had to give it one last try, so I asked how long is the wait. Without even looking at me, this lady said \"30 min\".Well... You could guess the rest. I walked out of the place and I will never ever ever going back to that place.",

Again. \u00a0The short version: While waiting for a delivery order, I received a call about an item out of stock. There was a substitution I was willing to accept, although it was \u00a31 more. I also offered to simply accept a refund for the missing item. Person on the phone kept insisting I take an alternate item at the same price, and did not know how to refund the initial item. As there was nothing else I wanted, I suggested in that case Tenshi absorb the \u00a31 difference and give me the alternate item already proposed. This did not strike me as unreasonable, given the issue was on Tenshi's side and I was already waiting for the order. \u00a31 seems like a small price to pay to show goodwill, apologize for the inconvenience, and maintain positive customer relations. Seriously. And, as it was, the call was becoming unnecessarily protracted. When the person rudely refused, I requested they cancel the entire order and send me a confirmation email to that effect. What a waste of time. Over a measly \u00a31 on what was a \u00a335 ticket. This is how Tenshi regards its customers.I never received a confirmation email, nor did I receive a call from the manager, 'Sumi'. \u00a0Instead, I received a call from the initial woman, ruder than ever, to say that they would get to my refund in 'a few days'. Great, now even more time to waste following up with the bank.Unbelievable. \u00a0With all the food options in central London, and in Angel especially, some basic courtesy seems like a smart strategic choice -- if nothing else. \u00a0Also, I was a very good customer and had ordered many times before.",

I have not yet moved into the modern world, so don't have a smart phone and can't check yelp on the go...so we chose to go into Tenshi because the menu on the door sounded delicious, and because there was a Japanese family munching through a huge dish of gorgeous looking sushi at the front of the restaurant (you can't get better advertising than that!!)The two waiting staff seemed sweet, but couldn't speak Japanese. This made me a little apprehensive as it's always a bit disconcerting to point to the numbers on a menu, rather than just list of the names of what you want to eat!! However, I need not have worried! The food came quickly, and was passed my sushi snobbery - Yay!We tried the fried Hottate (scallops) which were pretty good, and very garlicky. The Tempura moriawase was also not bad - the huge shrimps were juicy and delicious, and I love tempura'd sweet potato and carrots. Nom. Everyone should try the spinach with sesame dressing...it was sooo nice! Nom nom! And of course I ordered a pile of sushi... The unagi was pretty good, it could have been warmer, but the taste and texture were perfect. The sea bream was served with lemon - yum! And lastly the yellow tail and salmon were both looovely.

We were seated upstairs, where the service was not as attentive, but it was rather spacious. The menu had a very good choice of options, and I settled for ordering a number of small dishes that caught my eye. I got the takoyaki (octopus balls) and the kaki fry (deep fried oysters), as well as a bowl of miso soup and soft shell crab chili mayo inside out roll. The takoyaki and kaki fry really hit the spot... those are things you don't come across all that often, and it's so nice when they get it right. There were just four of the fried oysters, but they were all very large, so it was a decent portion (glad I didn't share it though!). My friend got agedashi tofu (fried tofu in a broth) and the spicy miso vegetable ramen. I wasn't quite a fan of the soggy fried tofu, but the ramen looked good and I was even more impressed that the pan fried dumplings had been put into the soup! The only other Japanese restaurant I have tried on Upper Street is Sen Nin, and by comparison I thought the food at Tenshi was much higher quality and more authentic.",
