It's always busy, a buzzy atmosphere due to its location, right next to Spitalfields market and part of the Old Truman Brewery. \u00a0Upstairs there are two separate areas, and there are DJ's and live musicians playing every night. \u00a0 There are often events at the Caf\u00e9, film screenings, yoga classes and I've even been to an exhibition opening with Gilbert & George as the star attraction!",

Amazing in the summer months as they have large buckets of ice cold beer you can dip into, there are always some enjoyable people watching to be done here. When the night falls, the dirty beats come out and the upstairs is transformed into a filthy (in a good way) drum and bass pumping haven. Full of trendy ravers, this place is good for both day and night. They do amazing salad boxes aswell and the food is cheap (\u00a34.50 for fresh burgers cooked in front of your eyes and a side of potato wedges) they also do great veggie varieties including some yummy grilled halloumi. Great in the summer, especially when the 'urban beach' is up and running round the corner.",

There's a fantastic BBQ right outside or a Jamaican jerk chicken stall a little further up, so there's not far to go for food! The entrance feels like a pretty normal cafe, but the moment you get upstairs the vibe kicks in. I guess it's a bit like a house party in a ridiculously big well decked out flat, with a separate dance room too. I've been to some wicked midweek sets here too - the atmosphere is brilliant. They've gone down the route of serving magical cans of Red Stripe, rather than draught beers - although they still come in at a premium. The only whine I have is that they close at that annoying time when you want to keep on partying but will miss the tube to get anywhere else.",

Drinks are reasonably priced compared to many places in the area and their food, also reasonably priced, is fresh and tasty. \u00a0On summer nights one can sit outside and enjoy the general milieu of a Brick Lane night or venture indoors for its dirty but quirky d\u00e9cor. \u00a0Climbing the steps from the front door one finds themselves in the dimly lit first room littered all about with cushions and squishy looking chairs. \u00a0This is the room to sit in, chat and generally relax. \u00a0For those of a livelier disposition, the back room (shut during the day) offers the chance to let loose and dance like a complete plonker. \u00a0Here you will find those dirty, dirty beats and the genuine 1001 flavour.1001 is a great jumping-off point for anyone clubbing in Shoreditch or alternatively a nice place for a cup of tea at lunchtime.",

We drank outside for a while and then moved upstairs to the club where we stayed for the rest of the evening.

Indoors there is a huge selection of healthy food, salads potatos and GODLY homebaked cheese cake, seriously you must try it.By night the venure hosts of variety of entertainments from bands to DJs, and is excellent for some true alternative nightlife, I went to a Brazlian night there once and it was crazy- a refreshing alternative to the endless indie clubs in London.

    "text": "This is the one place on Brick Lane that I can continue to bring any guests to in search of reliably manic fun and frolics. Its a big place - and combines a cafe, club and bar in one. There is a barbecue outside on the street, with an inevitable queue, crates of iced beers and rows of picnic tables for revellers and picnic-ers alike. Inside, on ground level, there is a cafe and bar where delicious toasted croissants, smoothies and Turkish borek pastries can be had at all hours of the day and night. Up the steps above the cafe section is the first set of record decks, surrounded by deep couches and temptingly squishy cushions. This area is generally regaled by reggae, dubstep or some other laid-back beats.In through the corridor and you find yourself in the dark back room. There is a smallish dance floor and more decks, usually to be found pumping out techno or breakbeats of some description. There is also a full bar and couches in here. \u00a0The crowd in here depends on the time of day. During daytime the atmosphere is sedate, with a lunch crowd. As night time approaches, a rougher and generally European crowd fills the back room. 1001 regularly stays open until 6am.The bouncers can get slightly over-zealous in their searches, patrols and ejections. There are bag checks at the main door, and also at the entrance onto Brick Lane, and up and down Dray Walk. Having said that, 1001 is still, unbelievably, free to enter. That fact, combined with the area's nasty street element, means that extra security of some sort is probably called for. The cooked food from the barbecue leaves something to be desired - the over-priced, over-sauced freezer-burgers probably tastes a whole lot better at the end of the night with a skinful of alcohol, than at the sober beginning. If I'm looking for hot food, I generally avoid it and head next door to Story Deli for some organic pizza instead.",

Due to its fame, weekends are always rammed - try weekdays instead then, you won't miss anything anyway as they have good music too. Grab food and drink from downstairs first. BBQ outside is such a bargain but I'm not impressed with those canned lagers just because they are too warm. I tried cakes twice and still don't love them either. Apart from that, it's all about atmosphere that wakes you up and shakes your body. Cosy seats that make you feel like home rather than sitting in a bar. You might have to squeeze yourself with someone when it gets busy. I wih they could do better for the toilets too.",

These were \u00a33.50. There is LOADS of seating outside to chill out and have a cigarette. You can meet loads of people here which is quality. Upstairs they have a big chill out area with loads of comfy sofas and chairs. There are some toilets in this bit too. People are just generally standing about chatting. Then there is an amazing back room - I went on a friday and it was drum n bass music - loads of fit guys. There' s a big bar in there aswell. And more amazingly comfy seats. There is like a little hole in the wall where the DJ spins from and everyone was going mental on the dancefloor. It closed at 2am. The bouncers were really nice and the bar staff were funny. I love this place and spent New Years Day here as well - was brilliant!",

During the warmer months Cafe 1001 is great, if only because it has the most outdoor seating of any drinking hole within the Truman Brewery, making this cavernous cafe ideally located for a spot of people watching.That said, I've always been distinctly unimpressed by 1001's coffee. Which is a shame because 1001 is, an, um, cafe and if this aspect of this popular haunt's performance was improved it would be a shoo-in for a five star rating.",

Got into Cafe 1001 bought a drink and a muffin by the way if you buy the cholate chip one, it is lacking in mositure meaning its taste dddrrrrryyyyy.So on that night we discovered an event called Short & Sweet which shows short film every monday from 7:30pm in the back room \u00a0and guess what it is for FREE! \u00a0The place was packed so i do suggest get their earlier, we had to sit on floor, but thats what i love about it, its not normal. They showed some really good quality short film various types. During the break the presenter asked us to talk with the person next to us, which was really cool we met two lovely ladies.For more info check out the website shortandsweet.tv plus they have a facebook group too.Love the atmosphere, the comfy sofas, dim lights the bar everything. \u00a0I know ill be a regular one, on mondays now.",

Beer!What I love about this place the most is its unpretentious vibe that means everyone can feel comfortable here. Do not expect fabulous service as this isn't what 1001 is about.

They cook burgers outside and sell a bunch of food inside as well as all the \u00a0coffee shop stable eats and drinks. The place has free wifi and a DJ spinning on Sunday as well. The place is a bit grungy though, but with all the couches it gives the place a cool vibe and perfect for a little break. I have never been there in the evening, but I heard that it gets pretty packed.",

    "text": "The deliberate grime of Cafe 1001 won't be to everyone's tastes but because of the very laid back attitude they promote \u00a0here you can expect plenty of 'individuals'. For example, last time I visited the security had to wake up a man lying across one of the sofa's and dressed from head to toe in leather. Leather hat, leather arm cuffs, leather waistcoat, leather trousers and Doc Martins. That's real commitment. Unfortunately his leather fly was gaping open and offending a few people less into the look... I've only ever had tea and cake from 1001, mainly because the other food didn't look too appealing, but at these prices you can't really complain too much. The burgers cooked on the barbecue outside are always popular with the drunken mobs but I've never been tempted. However, the music scene here is pretty buzzing and I've known them to get some great unsigned bands to perform. If you're looking for something a bit different this place might be right up your street just don't set your expectations of cleanliness too high!",

Back when I first came to London to visit friends at uni, this place was constantly heaving with too cool for school precursory hipsters, way back when we didn't even call them that. Now it seems in a sad state, only ever packed in the summer on market days. I feel sorry for the guy who mans the permanently installed grill parked outside. It's cheap enough and you can feel free to do whatever but now that Brick Lane's truly on the map, there are plenty of alternatives to 1001 and I wouldn't bother grabbing a bite here. Maybe just pay your \u00a34 for a can of Red Stripe and hang out on the benches outside if you're feeling a bit nostalgic.",

Was the outside grill part of the inside caf\u00e9 or were they two different businesses? Where do I order and where do I pay? Where can I sit? I'm not kidding -- I walked into and by this place probably 3 times to spy and observe. Finally I just took the plunge. I just went for it, cause I'm a cowboy like that.It's all one caf\u00e9, but with a separate til for outside fresh grill orders (beef burgers, veggie burgers, grilled haloumi and eggplant burgers) and another for inside coffee/pre-made sandwich/salad/bakery treats orders. The pasta and green salads always look fresh and healthy (not like the mayo and bacon-packed concoctions of grocery store standbys), are big enough for two meals and include a fresh baguette. The sandwiches come on fresh-baked bread and loaded with lovely things like chorizo, pesto, grilled chicken and avocado. (Sandwich eating has proven difficult for me to adjust to here in the UK, and it's a rare occasion when I can't pick a sandwich because they ALL sound good; usually it's because none of them do. So kudos to you, 1001.) Loads of indoor and outdoor seating and friendly enough staff. Decent prices that range from \u00a34-\u00a36 for a large sandwich. But don't get the wrong idea - this is no cute little boutique coffee house with sandwiches Come on, this is East London! It's gritty and unrefined; worn in and well loved.And, they take cards!",

However it can get quite busy on the weekends and at night.The place always has a busy vibe and a raw 'trendy' feel.Definitely a good option for food and drinks, however I believe this place opens on the weekends as a bar/dance venue, and I'm not sure what it is like then.Downsides are that it is a raw venue, so can feel a little run down and grubby, also due to large front window's it can get chilly in winter (it's great in summer), additionally sometimes as it's very popular you'll struggle to get a seat!",

The BBQ outside looked welcoming (and cheap) enough, so it seemed a perfectly appropriate Shoreditch pitstop. The veggie burger patty was frozen, collected from a box filled with other veggie burger patties; I'm sure you'll be unsurprised to hear that it won't be winning any awards for its momentous achievement in the culinary arts. But the bap it came in was fresh and enjoyable, as were all the salad ingredients that went on top of it. The two gigantor potato wedges that accompanied it, while a welcome complimentary addition to the \u00a35 lunch, were nothing particularly special.The couches and tables inside were lined with 20-somethings aglow behind their Macbooks, sapping Cafe 1001's free wifi. The vibe might be cool to some, twatty to others. The toilets rather bafflingly didn't have locks on the stall doors. So, in a way, I guess they ticked my public urination box after all.",

Its cushy lounge area with the free albeit over-stretched wifi is home to many wonderful memories of myself feeling extraordinarily urban and happenin' and content digging into their food with my fellow co-students.I seriously adore the food. The Burgers from the bbq station out front are huge, the potato wedges that come along with them fit to knock a person out when thrown with enough force. My half-greek cousin once told me that the Moussaka we had there was one of the best she'd ever had, and that has to count for something. I also have an ongoing love affair with all their baked goods, as the display on the bar is simply too enticing to walk by when you're planning on an afternoon of cramming. Especially the carrot cake.So, why only 4 stars, then? The coffee. It's a sad state of affairs but, alas, the coffee is quite deplorable. Add to that the fact that it's desperately overstuffed on the weekends and pretty drafty in the winter due to its warehouse premises, I'll have to deduct a star.",
