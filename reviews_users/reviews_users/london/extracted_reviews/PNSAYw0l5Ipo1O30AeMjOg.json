But the baguettes are pretty much the only reason to visit, and their only point of distinction from the other Vietnamese restaurants nearby in Shoreditch.We're talking cheap, wholesome, hot sandwiches that you just pick up and eat on the go. My recommendation is the classic grilled chicken satay, packed together with tangy chilli sauce, carrots, onions and cucumber in a sweet crusty roll, but there're plenty of other tasty fillings to choose from. My eye has often lingered over the grilled prawns and the caramel shredded pork, for example, but then I always revert back to my standard choice.As other folks have pointed out, it gets mentally frantic at lunchtime. Queues snake out the door, or orders get mixed up, or supplies on the sandwich counter run low. It's best to pick your moment before visiting, but it's certainly worth a visit.",

When my food came up, I grabbed my order ready to high tail it out of there but when I was outside and looked back into the window, there was said woman: desperately flailing her arms at me beckoning me to not eat that sandwich and come back in. I came back in, she said it was the wrong bread, brown not white. Grabbed it. Ran. Enjoyed it, but thoroughly beleaguered by the entire experience.Maybe it was just lunchtime? Everywhere on the web the reviews were so lovely. Was I fooled by the foodie bloggers? Maybe growing up in a Little Vietnam means that I'm spoiled when it comes to simple, authentic banh mi without the drama.",

This was really frustrating, and i think they should have been a bit more considerate and proffessional. However i manged to get my foot in the door today, and i can say all is forgiven!!lol....The menu was really good and the prices were even better. My partner and I dine out at least 2 times a week and we love to try out various foods and sink in the culture. We felt really welcomed and the decor was warm and vibrant. The young Vietnamese waitress was very polite, hospitable and all what we had hoped to expect. We really enjoyed the Vietnamese spring rolls, they are tasty and well presented. We also ordered summer rolls, altohugh we admit that we have tasted better, the summer rollls lacked a certain something along with the peanut dipping sauce. Their Banh Mi special also lacked in taste, and i will have to agree with a few reviews that there were too many different flavours going on that it was rather hard to really know what you were tasting and eating,also i really was not keen on the pork,it looked and taste slightly plastic!!! therefore it was difficult to savor certain tastes, i partically enjoyed the grilled beef banh mi, and it was simply grilled beef, picked veg and some sauce, ... Overall i would dine again, but the only downside was that it we felt slightly rushed by the waiters, and maybe not a place to stay and chit chat if thats what you want!! :) but i think its a place worth checking out.",

It was weird. And then I went outside and fell over. See, eventful). \u00a0I was like \"just give me food, I don't care where\" but I was pleased with this choice since I went to Vietnam for six whole days in October and am therefore fully justified in my critique of their cuisine.The flat fried noodles were lovely; nice mix of veggies and pork, a bit greasy but in my addled state, exactly what I wanted. \u00a0My friend had the cold noodle salad which was light and delicious (obviously I tried it) and they cheerfully gave us extra bowls of sauce too. \u00a0Service is super fast and they have proper Vietnamese coffee. \u00a0It's a little weak, but the fact that you can even buy these tiny percolators of joy in central London makes me a happy bunny.The summer rolls were fab but the spring rolls a bit disappointing. \u00a0Good taste but too small, which meant that the ratio of filling to overly-fried outside seemed wrong and they had too much crunch and not enough internal softness. \u00a0And you only get three but they cost about \u00a34. \u00a0Not ideal.It took me the better part of an hour to work out why the huge mirror over the stairs had a handle on the bottom and hinges on top. \u00a0I was convinced there was a secret compartment hidden in the brick wall before I realised that it was a wardrobe door hung sideways. \u00a0Doh. \u00a0The whole shabby chic thing they've got going on is a bit Kirstie Allsopp-tastic but works really well.I'm quite sure purists would insist that any Kingsland Road joint is infinitely more authentic than this. \u00a0But if you're after a yummy centrally-located sit-down lunch for under a tenner in pleasant surroundings then you could do an awful lot worse than Banh Mi Bay.",

    "text": "Fair warning: I don't think this review will be useful for non-vegetarians.I have eaten here twice, once for lunch (when I had one of their vegetarian sandwiches) and the second time at a Yelp event for dinner (when I had the stir fried tofu). The sandwich was nice, the price \u00a0reasonable, but in the end neither had a \"wow\" feeling, nor more important a sense of fulfillment. Basically we left, and ended up having another full lunch within two hours, which does tends to mitigate the cheapest of the original sandwich. The dinner options for those who don't eat meat are very limited. None of the Pho's can be made vegetarian (though the manager reassured me that this would change within a month or two - stay tuned). The tofu dish I ended up being really quite nasty, and not something I would want to repeat. The pluses here are a pleasant dining room, and very friendly and attentive service. The restaurant is quite small so it would be wise to book if you are going as a group. The meat dishes looked good to me, so I'd be very happy to update this review when the vegetarian options catch-up.",

Just a mere hop skip and jump away from Leather Lane (the clothes ladies, the clothes!) is this charming little Vietnamese restaurant with subtly sanded down chairs and tasteful statement wallpaper. Not only is the food really really tasty and very well priced, but the staff are so friendly and the atmosphere really nice and chilled out, making it a great place to eat in with friends or otherwise. (Note: they do offer takeaway, but not delivery... yet).I was first inspired to come in here, because they said they made Vietnamese baguettes. Now, for anyone who has ever been to Vietnam, you know what I'm talkin' bout. Those crunchy baguettes are like air-filled heaven-sent goodness and are just awesome. So looking for a taste of that, brought me here.However, I haven't actually tried the baguettes yet, as I have been far too busy sampling the pho, bun noodles and other things on the menu. All of which are scrumptious and mouthwatering good. The food tastes like it's more authentic than say Pho, and dare I say it, I seem to have realigned my loyalty to this place. Plus the portions are reasonably sized and the fresh juices are yummy. It's definitely my new favourite Vietnamese place.",

If you're lucky enough to get a table, the service is pretty good. Things I've tried that I liked:1. com dac biet (special rice dish)The cha (meatloaf-like) is well-prepared, the \"bi\" is a bit on the dry side, and so is the rice. The dressing makes up for it. The lemongrass grilled pork is nicely done. Definitely an overall good dish. 2. b\u00e1nh m\u00ec Probably the best I've had in London. It's a filled baguette with good filling. Recommend for takeaway. 3. Ca phe sua daVietnamese iced-coffee. They use condensed milk (good!) and it's quite close to what I'm used to in Little Saigon, California.If you're looking for Vietnamese food around this area, this is the one to try.",

The bread was so stale and dry it ruined my whole lunch. \u00a0The pate didn't look very appetising it was dark and tasteless, I thought it would be pink. \u00a0The only thing that gave flavour was the chilli. Fillings were quite meagre and yes I agree with fellow Yelpers there is no wow factor. If you sell baguette sandwiches you should check everyday that your bread is not stale and if you think you can fob off stale bread to customers you'll never get repeat business. \u00a0 I had high hopes based on the reviews I read but based on this experience I would never go here ever again.",

I was lucky enough to happen upon Banh Mi Bay while running some errands over the weekend. Now a few days later, I'm craving a banh mi from here again. Unless something goes horribly wrong within the next hour, I'll heading there for lunch again today. Not only is this a yummy place but it's easy on the wallet too! \u00a33.50 for an ample sandwich is awesome. The vast majority of Banh Mi Bay's dishes are at or under five quid with the most expensive being \u00a37 for pork, prawn and crab noodle soup. See you there?",

    "text": "I've been hitting vietnamese restaurants at full force for the past few months. Not because its trendy but a lot of my friends suggest these places and I just tag along. (i fail as a yelp elite, I should be making the calls about where to go LOL)Anyways, Banh Mi Bay. I think their specialty lies in their banh mi's but I didn't try them since I went for an evening birthday meal. I don't think this place is great for birthdays at all, with most restaurants, you bring the cake, they open it, candles, bring it to your table. Service right? Not Banh Mi Bay! Apparently giving them the cakebox to put aside somewhere, that's not obvious at all. (if I wanted to take it out the box, I would've kept it on my table, no?!) Aside from the birthday misunderstanding, I was so disappointed with the bo tai pho. The broth was not rich enough at all, nor did they give me much chillis for my condiments dish. (I got 3 mini slices of mini chillis-not even a whole chilli!) and NO coriander. it's like they wanted my dish to be bland. Birthday Girl's Banh Canh noodle broth was much better. Im quite sad I didn't order that and a bun noodle dish (super summery!) was also good. Sounds like I got the bum deal. We also ordered summer rolls and a prawn salad, the latter lacked that extra sourness, it was REALLY sweet. Vietnamese coffee, as recommended by other yelpers was like a caffeine roundhouse kick to the face, super strong and super sweet. The Lemonade was essentially lemon cordial and sparking water, it was quite refreshing and zingy, I'll admit. Service was a bit haphazard, the staff seemed quite flustered by the fact we wanted to celebrate there and they seemed a bit awkward when we asked them to take some group photos.(my friends and I)It wasn't bad by any means, but I've definitely had better more generous vietnamese places.",

    "text": "Came here for an early dinner... the restaurant was decked in bright colours from the outside, which is a really refreshing sight in an otherwise dreary place. I ordered a pork shoulder noodle soup - forgot the Vietnamese name for it, but the noodle was a mixture between Udon and Silver Needle Noodles (Lao Shu Fen). Anyways the bowl cost \u00a37.50 but the serving was surprisingly tiny. The soup was filled 3/4 of the bowl, but the noodles accounted for less than half. Honestly, I barely felt anything in my stomach after that. Really not worth the money at all.Also ordered Vietnamese iced coffee because the che ba mau was out of stock (disappointing!). As usual, the coffee is amazing and it cannot be faulted no matter how many different Vietnamese restaurants I go. You can not go wrong with condensed milk hahaha.In the end, because I wasn't full after a pricey \u00a37.50 noodle, I ordered a Bay Special baguette to go. The baguette was amazing, but it would be better if it were served hot. Still, this is a way better alternative than a Pret sandwich which costs equally as much. However, only order the baguette if you're taking out, because eating-in costs another additional \u00a31, making it a total of \u00a34.95.",

We started out as six... then became 12... then were 18, and Bahn Mi Bay managed to successfully adapt to our huge group, take our orders and bring food with great speed and service, and keep a great attitude about a huge group arriving without reservation and in the middle of the lunch rush. Well done on that last bit.I have never had Vietnamese before (and in fact didn't really this time either, opting for a respectable chicken curry), but those who had say the Pho is top notch, with generous portions and a great assortment of fresh ingredients. My Vietnamese spring rolls were quite small, but very savory. The chicken curry with baguette was tasty and rich. Primarily, though, I was impressed by the service, and have heard from others that this is the place to go for great service. Being in a convenient spot for lunch meetings, I think it's quite likely I'll be back. Definitely going for the Pho next time.",

    "text": "Banh Mi Bay: I really want to like you, but you're just not quite hitting it. The pho is more or less on point -a little flat - but they definitely get props for offering a vegetarian version which is something you don't see too often. \u00a0The banh mi are decent too, but could be a little more generous with the fillings. My lady had the vegetarian bun tau hu chay \u00a0the last time we went but was unimpressed - they'd gone too light on the mint and coriander. Compared to say a grilled pork version, a tofu version is always gonna have a bit more work to do on the flavour front so there's no excuse for holding back on the elements that would give it a fighting chance.Service can be a bit patchy as well - if it's busy be prepared to get your wave on.Overall, Banh Mi Bay is OK, but it won't blow your mind. Price-wise it's relatively cheap but eating in nudges the price up enough to make you wonder whether you're being played, just a little bit. A little bit of extra effort and thought and these guys could smash it.",

I highly doubt I will find a pho place in London that will even compare to pho in California, but I won't burn that bridge yet.Banh Mi Bay is down the street from my school so I find myself here quite a bit. Their broken rice dishes are actually really good and based on my experience with their pho, I will gladly order their rice dishes any day. I've tried the grilled chicken and grilled pork and both are tasty. The pho is unbearably bland and you're going to have to douse it in hoisin and sriracha to give it some flavor. Instead of pho they should really call it noodles in hot water with meat. But other than that, the service is pretty quick and everything else I tried isn't half bad. The restaurant is clean and they're open for lunch and reopen for dinner around 5:30PM. Just an FYI, since I tried going there after class one day and I had to wait til they opened for dinner.",

Didn't love the summer roll but I think I got one with a weird filling.Anyway, came back today and randomly decided to try the tiger prawn banh mi. The prawns were freshly cooked and seriously delicious, really punchy flavour which blended so so deliciously with the pickled carrots. I really savoured it. Also, whereas the first time I came here I didn't really like the bread today it was really good. Fresh, crispy, even the bit that didn't have any sauce/filling involved (which normally just makes me sad). Friendly service, pretty decor, great value for money.What would really make the sandwiches perfect is: more filling. Now I know that makes me sound greedy, but it's really all about the savouring, and getting the right balance of flavour between the filling and the bread, blah blah just bring me more prawns.",

Great tasty sandwiches---be sure to get #2, the pulled caramel pork---sweet, spicy, and simply delicious---the perfect summertime baguette. Banh Mi Bay draws in the lunch crowd, so get there early to snag a table or be prepared to get your sandwich to go. I've been twice now for lunch and both times got variations of a pork sandwich which is a relative bargain at \u00a33.50. Next time I will have to try one of the mains as they looked great (a wide assortments of soups and grilled meats are on the menu) but are more appropriate for dining in. The restaurant looks more like a pastel green colored English tea room than a Vietnamese cafe.",

Lunch for a fiver is the way to go when you're a struggling uni student AND sriracha!!They also had vietnamese coffee for about the same price as the coffee places around the area, but much stronger. Also elixer much sought after by uni students. If I planned it correctly, I could have dinner, and a post dinner coffee all waiting for me when I got out of class... I was always quite chuffed at my efficiency.I did get fancy a few times and actually sit in, usually pretty full for dinner. It should be known that sitting in is about 2 quid more than taking out and I believe it's a similar menu. They do have apps and such that aren't on their board of course, but same thing for the most part. Pho is quite good as well. When a place messes up pho, I don't know if I can trust anything else on their menu, but they do quite well here. Many good eats and convos had here.",

Between two people, we ordered vegan banh mi, pho chay, and bun noodles.At the very least I expect a hint of cinnamon and anise in any pho, but this one tasted of pure vegetable stock cube and lacked any depth. Maybe my expectations are out of line, but based on other places I've eaten both in Vietnam and elsewhere, I think Banh Mi Bay skimped on the fresh herbs and chillies.The bun noodles were passable, but the sauce didn't have the punch I expect from this dish. The sandwich was the highlight of the meal, mainly because the baguette was good. The service was really good and the staff very friendly and welcoming, and I enjoyed the open kitchen concept, but the food was lacklustre. I might return for the sandwich if I was in the area, but that's it.Someone with less experience of Vietnamese food and/or an appreciation for mellow and toned down flavours may find this place more to their liking...",

Coming from an area where Asian minorities are indeed the majority, I had become unaware that not everywhere in the world was as privileged as myself and all of my fellow Northern Californians. Soon enough, I had found myself salivating over thoughts of steaming bowls of my favorite Vietnamese soups and dishes. Hell, I was going bonkers just to smell the familiar scent of dipping fish sauce that is just so perfect when the moment is right. I had listed Banh Mi Bay on my list to try and, so far, it has been my favorite. Compared to a lot of the other places, their menu has far more variety, and they capture the flavors more impressively. Their pho noodles are still a bit wider than they should be, but sometimes you just have to accept what you have in front of you. Honestly, I was already happy when I saw that they used real hoisin sauce, real Sriracha, and served all the right accompanying vegetables. Plus, the owners are Vietnamese. =)I've managed to get a group of people from work, which is conveniently located only a 5 minutes walk away, completely hooked on this restaurant and they have passed their friends along as well. Between all of us, we've tried the chicken and beef Phos, the crab and combination Banh Canhs, the Spring Rolls, some Vietnamese sandwiches, and their tri-colored dessert. I can assure you that we have loved them all, except maybe the last. And, really, what's not to love about a restaurant that's open late on Sundays? Wait, correction: What's not to love about a restaurant that is open on Sundays?!Note to owners if you are reading this: please add soda xi muoi to your menu!",

All in all, if I were in the area, I'd probably drop in again. I wouldn't go out of my way for it, though.

    "text": "Up there with the Newcommen-Watt steam engine and the invention of human rights among the eighteenth century's foremost contributions to modern life, the sandwich is so much more than the sum of its parts. Practical, ubiquitous, and frequently - if not universally - delicious, the sandwich is one of life's great constants. And yet at the same time, versatility is key to its appeal, offering a doughy canvass for the world's culinary diversity. Does anything better embody this than banh mi? There's something truly inspired about that one-two punch of rich, sweet pork fat and the zing of coriander-laced vegetables, all sinking into rice-soft dough. Almost enough to temporarily turn one into an apologist for the sins of French colonialism. Throw in the inherent fun of its 'street food' mental associations, and there are few better prospects for lunch-on-the-go.Banh Mi Bay's 'Bay Special' was a solid fix to my recent cravings, but by no means exemplary. While undoubtedly a good sandwich, it still left significant room for improvement. The pate could have creamier, the caramel-glazed ham more flavourful. Above all, the small dose of coriander and lack of any discernible seasoning or sauce deprived this banh mi of its characteristic freshness. At \u00a35.95, it was reasonable, without quite being good value. All in all, a solid lunch, but not a day-changing one.",

Specifically, I ordered a Banh Mi Chicken Satay and was hesitant since they deviate from the traditional Banh Mi protein options. The veggies were fresh and the Satay was a bit on the dry side. Altogether, this place offers legitimate Banh Mi and I'd consider it a must if want to munch on a budget.",

They were both yummy enough to make me into an instant fan.The only problem is this place is BUSY at lunch time and so the take-away line often goes out of the door. They are very speedy at putting orders together...but it's all a bit of an un-organised jumble... so you might have to wait a while to receive your lunch! *It seems my yelp friends have all reviewed this place yeeears ago!

Compared to the pho back home in the states, the broth is very comparable and they had all of the fixings, too. The noodles were wide noodles instead of skinny vermicelli noodles which was surprising but I've found that all pho restaurants in London use these noodles. I missed the skinny noodles but overall this place holds up okay! I've also ordered their spring rolls which are very tasty as well, though kind of expensive for only three spring rolls. Nonetheless, the location is great and the food is good. I'll be back!",

It gets super busy in the afternoon during weekdays with all the city workers but you can opt for take out if you're in a rush. Although the table services are pretty quick too (the ladies there are super efficient) The only critique is that you'll come out smelling like food a bit :)",

Banh Mi Bay is not a _bad_ option. But, well...it's not the best, either.It's fast, and it's fresh, and it's really affordable. Tofu bun noodle salad is a good choice. Pho is PHOINE (fine? Yeah?). It's fine. I appreciate that when you get takeaway that all the individual things are separately packaged up (bean sprouts in a little baggie, hoisin in a little cup). They have specials of the week but, otherwise, it's a pretty stripped down menu of Vietnamese go-tos (spring rolls, range of buns, rice dishes, phos and banh mi). Which is fine for someone as indecisive as I am.Not a place I'd ever make as a destination spot, but totally fine as an option if you happen to find yourself hungry and standing in front of it.Yelp note: significant discounts if you get take-away so, on a nice day, do so: many great nearby options for a picnic!",

Food arrives quickly, however it's brought from downstairs giving you the fear that the person bringing it up may fall and drop it all. I'm sure this doesn't happen often...I've heard that the Bahn Mi is actually their signature dish, so will need to try this on my next visit and update this score. We were seated at the middle of the restaurant and when it's lunchtime it can get quite annoying as you'll be surrounded by the lunch crowd looking to get their takeaway.",

It came somewhat lukewarm which is always disappointing. Also, I felt like there was too much more noodles than soup. Having said that, it was still good, so a good place for a quick pho fix. The sides were all solid as well. A pleasant surprise was the pan fried pork, which almost reminded me of Korean bbq meat. Service was good. The waitresses were prompt and kind.

I was expecting something good.We ordered:-Goi Cuon - Summer Rolls Tiger prawns, sliced pork, rice vermicelli, lettuce and Vietnamese herbs wrapped in rice paper, served with a peanut hoi sin dipping sauce. Pho noodle soup for my boyfriend (sorry don't know which one he ordered, some sort of beef)Bun Vermicelli Noodle Salad (Ga Sate - Chargrilled Satay Chicken)2x Vietnamese iced coffee.Comments:The summer rolls were so and so, tasted really bland. The prawn was big, which I appreciated, but the only flavour is only coming from the dipping sauce.My boyfriend's Pho unfortunately came with lukewarm soup. It was really disappointing. The meat tasted pretty nice but noone wants lukewarm meals. We scouted other tables who ordered Pho after us and their noodle soups were steaming hot! That's inconsistency right there for you.My vermicelli noodle salad was ok, I like the one at Cafe East more. The chicken was pretty dry, but I was hungry.The iced coffee was really strong. They don't use the Truong brand that I am used to, and they seem to put less condensed milk in as well, so it tasted more bitter than usual.The worst thing is by the time we left, I was already feeling ill. By the time we got home about 30-40 min later, both of us were throwing up and on the toilet in general. I really don't want to come back here :( It's not like the food was anything spectacular, and I think it has some hygiene issues perhaps.",
