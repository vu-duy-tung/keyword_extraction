    "text": "I've been to Byron a few times but never to this particular branch in Covent Garden. They specialise in burgers and they do a pretty good job of it as I have always enjoyed what I have ordered. On this particular occasion I had the Byron Bacon burger which was very tasty. The service was very good and this has always been the case with any of my visits. My only criticism/feedback is there is no drink included in the kids menu and on the main menu there are no fries included with the burgers. Surely this is a popular combo (ie burger and fries) and adding them together would give customers more value for money. Lastly, I would have no hesitation in recommending Byron to friends, family & strangers!",

Why did he bother to wear a belt and not cinch it enough to do its job is beyond me. Hmm...I digress.We ordered a hamburger, onion rings and mac and cheese. The hamburger had a great smoky flame broiled taste. Very yum. The batter on the onion rings was crispy but not flimsy and falling apart. But the rings could have stood to be less oily. As for the mac and cheese...*drum roll* It was okay. Nothing much to write home or here about. It was cheesy but not creamy. And everyone knows mac and cheese has to be both!So I would go back for the burger. Definitely one of the better burgers I've had since moving here.",

It's a fairly substantial chain of its own now, ten restaurants strong stretching from Kingston to Canary Wharf. Despite my misgivings of chain restaurants generally, I have to admit that Byron appears to be really rather quite good. It's a clean, tiled room with church hall style chairs and basic decor. There's a cavernous space downstairs that I hope fills out regularly.It was a quick bite, post and prior to a few beers. I went for the Byron Burger and courgette fries. Never having had courgette fries, I was pleasantly surprised. Soft and juicy courgette strips, in a light and crispy batter. Perfect. The burger was cooked medium, with a beautiful pink colour. The charred flavour I was hoping for only came through in the last last few mouthfuls but it was there, and it was good. There was a nice tang to the cheese, though the bacon was a little thick and came away in lumps.",

First, the bacon was waffish and translucent. Whatever flavor that bacon may have offered was swallowed up by the tasty crispy onions. Also, I ordered the burger medium well and it ranged, left to right, from medium well to medium rare. I never saw a burger that inconsistently done before.

The cheddar was very tasty. You could tell that they use quality ingredients. The fries were very good and the onion rings are the best I've had. My husband and I found this while walking around the neighborhood and we were so thankful that we gave it a try. We did not receive horrible service. Our server was quite friendly and attentive.",

No, but it doesn't need to - because it's strength is when you want to keep things simple, easy and cheap. \u00a0A tip: go or the courgette fries - they're delicious.",

Simple and straight to the point, the burgers are juice and delicious and they taste like a sticky summer night when my dad's just flipped them off the grill. Cooked perfectly with the classic toppings and a coke in a glass bottle, it's just the best. Hits the spot. The people watching is great because there is always such a diverse clientele and i always get a giggle out of people who sit daintily and sip their wine while eating their burger with a knife and fork. My only complaint is that the tables are a little close together and I've been stuck awkwardly, and unintentionally listening in on my neighbors conversations.",

It is almost like a unhelpful game of pick-up sticks when trying to eat them. The rosemary addition is close to useless. three tiny leaves of rosemary on one chip is a little far from the advertisement. That being said, a great place to bring friends, or co-workers, and enjoy a couple of juicy burgers, chips and a shake on the side!",

Service to start of with was very good and quick. Ordered some wings for a starter and they were yummy, particularly loved the blue cheese dip. We all had the cheese fries with bacon. They were good but a little light on the cheese. Husband had the Reuben burger. He says it's messy to eat but totally worth it. Daughter had double bacon and cheese and she loved it. I had the big smoke. It was tasty but felt it was a little light on the bbq pulled pork, was kind of a hit and miss. We also had milkshakes. Oreo and Mississippi mud something. They were amazing. Best Oreo milkshake I have had in a long time. Had the brownie with ice cream for dessert which was very good and Oreo cheesecake freakshakes which were beautifully presented and tasted amazing.Service at the end was a little slow, took ages to get the bill but it's all good.

Luckily they also take Apple Pay; or else I may have been washing dishes while I was there. I am traveling in London and forgot my credit card in my dress pockets from the day before. I came I. Ate then realized no card. Yay Apple Pay saved me. The food was good. I asked for medium rare and I got medium rare. I know it's just a burger but cooked right makes all the difference to me. They even had ketchup on the table. I like not having to ask for normal stuff at a burger place. I am sure to stop in here again for a comfortable and affordable meal. The prices were fairly descent for the area. The food service was also fairly quick. One last thing. When I ran my Apple Pay charge. They didn't force me to rip them. \u00a0They actually bypassed the tip screen and handed the machine with just my good bill. This was different to me and so I asked them if I could tip and I did. Ok I recommend this somewhat American burger joint.",

The tables around us got served including people who came in after us. We never even received it beverages! The waitress kept glancing at us but never came close enough for us to flag down. We finally were able to grab her and she apparently said our ticket had been closed and we had received our food. (She also didn't remember she was our waiter). She re entered our order and it finally came...with a mistake. Sigh. To be fair, she did discount our food for her mistakes.So how was the food? Ehh it was okay. The burgers are a bit on the smaller side...similar in size to Shake Shack. The Bryon cheese was a bit thick and I'm fairly certain Byron sauce is the same special sauce...that thousand island type sauce..,a lot of places use. The cheese fries were crispy but had very little sauce. I guess for those looking for a taste of America they may enjoy it? But guys, we do burgers much much better.",

Long wait times, bad service and mice.We were going to see a show and arrived here with 1 hour 15 to spare. After being told the wait time is 35 minutes but being assured that would be fine, we sat down. Upstairs full, downstairs fairly busy. We're not asked for drinks when seated but we look through the menu. We quickly decided what we wanted and tried to catch the attention of the waiter who knew we were in a hurry. The response is everyone is going to the theatre we just need to wait. At this point I'm killing for a drink, there's a guy behind the bar but he ignores us. After asking someone for water and waiting ten minutes we ask someone else, who gets us the glass that had been on the side since we walk in, and a jug with a couple glasses. Fortunately our friend didn't want to drink.After 20 minutes we get to order our food. While we wait, the couple next to us well arrived after us has managed to get food already. That annoyed me. Downstairs is starting to empty now. The couple next to us finish and we still haven't got food. We keep asking to be told it's coming. While waiting we watch a mouse scurry across the floor which freaks my friend out but I'm not leaving we need to eat. Makes her anxious the rest of the night. After 45 minutes we go to leave, there's one couple left downstairs and upstairs is quiet. As we head up we say to the waiter we have to go he just says nonchalantly that 'it's ok don't worry' like are you for real? It's not bloody ok we've sat here for an hour and not got food. Upstairs we walk out the door and my friend turns to see food under the great lamp that looks like it could be for us.... We asked and it was, so we wolf down the mediocre food in 5 minutes and rush to the theatre with literal minutes until start. No time to argue the wait time and everything so we paid full price without the whisper of even an apology. I don't hate many food places but fuck Byron burgers.",

    "text": "Had great service and a very good burger here before going to see The Lion King. We had only 40 minutes to get a bite, no reservations, and neither I nor the mrs. were very hungry. Byron's took us in right away, took our drink and food order quickly, and the food came out fast! The standard cheeseburger was cooked perfectly medium with a good blend of gooey cheese and the side of onion rings were fresh and homemade. Jacob, our awesome server, was engaging, friendly and even offered to split our shared burger for us. We got our food so fast we even had time for dessert! We tried a banana, caramel and \"biscuit\" concoction not knowing what we were getting into. It ended up being a parfait-like banana pudding (delish) and the \"biscuit\" was actually layers of graham crackers. Silly Brits and their \"biscuits\"...",

    "text": "I first discovered Byron's accidentally while wandering near Holborn Underground Station (it's also walking distance from Charring Cross) looking for food after a film/lecture at LSE. We had a short wait at 9ish on a Friday, probably about 10-15 minutes. On our return visit, also a Friday, we had the same wait at 730.As soon as we sat down I was convinced this was American owned. Who else but an American would know to put Cholula and French's mustard on every table, put Sierra Nevada on tap on the menu and offer classics like no frills cheeseburgers and milkshakes simply and without the Americana kitsch so commonly assigned to these types of restaurants in the UK?Turns out I was wrong. It's British owned but the guy did his homework, and certainly fooled this Yankee. The burgers are high-quality meat, served simply and with all the right fixins: tomato, special sauce (probably ketchup and mayo blend), sliced red onion and fresh, leafy green lettuce. Optional add ons are a variety of cheeses, bacon, avocado. The burgers are just the right size, juicy and the choice in meat quality is distinct. The bun is a bit too soft for my preference but not a meal ruiner. The service is pretty good, with the server smiling and checking back twice after the meal was delivered and even chatting us up a bit. This location is quite large, with a downstairs area as well as more than two dozen tables at ground level. We got an Oreo sundae on our last visit, and it was only so-so. I would prefer a better quality ice cream and there was little Oreo about it, save for the cookie being added to the top and maybe a half of another crushed up into the rest.But overall I'm really impressed with this burger place's offerings and ambience. Worth a try if you like good quality burgers, American or otherwise.",

    "text": "For vegetarians there is the portebello burger. Burgers don't come with sides or fries, that's extra. That said, I ordered a Cobb salad and it was massive and delicious and so filling! crisp juicy lettuce, spinach, chargrilled chx, crispy and chewy bacons, creamy avocado. I skipped the blue cheese and subbed with a grano padano. I didn't even need to dress it. It was that delicious. AND MASSIVE (did i mention it already?) It was bigger than my face. \u00a0Go for Croquettes fries if you like your fried zucchini which was yummmmm. Fries are stringy ones and you couldn't go wrong with it. \u00a0Busy, loud, great service. Will come back again.",

    "text": "Great tasting burgers (definitely agree with their slogan - \"Proper hamburgers\") with interesting options for sides. Really love their onion rings and courgette fries, as the batter is so tasty. Also love that they do skinny fries. The staff are very friendly and attentive. Lovely booths in this branch - giving a cosy, American feel.",

    "text": "LONDON RESTAURANTS! \u00a0I MUST HAVE YOUR ATTENTION! This Byron knows good service.Seriously. \u00a0No, seriously.Okay so Byron burgers aren't going to top the list of anyone's favorite burger on the planet. \u00a0But as far as chains go, Byron does the job and does the job better than the other popular chain GBK. \u00a0I had a Roquefort burger which was cooked perfectly, along with skin on chips which were also tasty, although slightly lacking in salt, and a chocolate oreo shake. \u00a0All were good and perfectly serviceable. \u00a0The crispy red onion on the Roquefort burger really makes it quite tasty. \u00a0Totally recommend.But what I want to talk about is the service. \u00a0Our group of 9 walked in at 7:50, having booked a table at 8pm. \u00a0Whoops. \u00a0They couldn't find our booking. \u00a0Well, that's not great. \u00a0So the host looked around and said that if we went to get a drink, he would have a table for us by 8:15. \u00a0Okay, it's a bit inconvenient, but not killer.So our group went across the road to Sophie's for a drink. \u00a0Get our beverages, and suddenly we turn around to see that the Byron host had walked over to tell us that our table was ready and to take our time and come back whenever we're ready. \u00a0I was impressed by this alone. \u00a0How nice is that?Then, halfway through our meal, the manager walks up, unsolicited, and says \"I understand there was an issue with your booking, so we're going to take several of the food items off the bill.\" \u00a0And he delivered on that promise. \u00a0Not to mention, our waiter was totally spot on.Say what? \u00a0Seriously, I will love this Byron forever for the top notch way they handled a minor inconvenience. \u00a0Super classy folks. \u00a0No excuses, just awesome delivery.",
