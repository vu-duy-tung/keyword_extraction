    "text": "I was lured here on a lazy sunday by the prospect of an \"authentic\" American brunch ... and i am happy to say that i was not disappointed.The menu is sufficiently american (at least you get the stuff you get in New York). So if you are craving for blueberry pancakes, this is a place to go to. More importantly, unlike in USA, they have \"short stack\" options for pancakes ... so even non-Americans can order a full plate of food and eat it rather than waste half of it :)I ordered a lumberjack breakfast ... 3 pancakes with maple syrup along with bacon and 2 eggs ... turned out to be a good decision ... good food and very filling.If you order a coffee, you get free unlimited refills ... the first time i have seen that in London. How cool is that !!! :)It was surprising to see that the price of the milkshakes was \u00a34.20. Too much ... but i still ordered a banana shake. When it arrived i realized why it cost so much. It was humongous ... a huge tumbler full of the shake ... more than double the quantity you get in other places in London. I could finish only about half of it and asked them to give me the rest of it in a takeaway glass. This is where they lose a star ... i will never understand how could a glass full of shake become only 1/4th glass full in the transfer process ... pretty clumsy in my opinion.The food was reasonably cheap ... with each of the breakfast dishes at between \u00a35 - \u00a38, it makes for good value for money. I will surely return here.P.S: The map on the right doesn't seem to be correct. Its at the intersection of Curtain and Rivington.P.S.2: Liverpool Street station is almost as close to the Diner as Old Street.",

    "text": "I discovered The Diner on Curtain Road whilst living in student halls on nearby Pitfield Street. Whilst not particularly student friendly in terms of price it is an experience I would definitely recommend, the retro decor and read leather booths re-creating that all American eating experience (including free refill coffee!). The menu consists of everything you could ever imagine ordering at a typical American diner, from the obligatory hot dog and fries to burritos, corn dogs, chili dogs, milkshakes, and the ever-present mystery that is 'wet fries'. They also have an all day breakfast menu, serving blueberry pancakes, fried breakfast and a whole host of other dishes that probably aren't all that good for you but taste delicious. As I mentioned before it isn't cheap, which is the biggest downside, but then London is expensive, and its worth it for the experience at least once. The service isn't the best, and with the staff's non uniform policy you'd be forgiven for thinking they would be more at home working in the American Apparel store across the road, but it's fun nontheless, and situated as it is in London's pre-eminent hipster district not bad for the odd bit of celebrity spotting - we sat across from Klaxons on what must have been their day off, and Alexa Chung is a well known regular.",

I had a taste of Laura N's banana shake which was bolstered with a large shot of Baileys. Wow!The prices are good. For a regular burger you are looking at shifting anything from \u00a35 - \u00a38. The main meals are in a similar price range but top out at \u00a39.50.You have to pay for sides so don't expect fries with your burger. Although a burger with a side will barely cost you more than a tenner. For the standard, this is definitely worth it. If you are going to add an extra dish to your burger, go for the onion rings.

I thought the milkshakes were also something a bit special, so thick with ice cream that you could probably eat them with a knife and fork.However, on my last visit the service was terrible. Somehow the waiter managed to strike the fine balance between ignoring some tables completely and rushing others to make a choice within seconds of sitting down. When I found a hair in my burger (not on top but properly mixed in with the mince) he just shrugged it off. Fortunately the manager quickly came over to do a bit of damage control and the burger was taken off our bill but it was only when I looked at the receipt that we had been charged an extra 50p for mayonnaisse! The prices in The Diner are already pretty steep considering that it's essentially just a burger joint and by adding extra little charges like this you can't help but feel like you're being ripped off.",

This place seems like a pretty standard fairly up market American diner restaurant and serves all the usual fare. We would have gotten burgers here had we not eaten them elsewhere beforehand. We all got good-sized milkshakes which were quite enjoyable. The fries were passable but the mayonnaise that we had to request almost tasted off. The mac and cheese seemed to be 95% cheese, with no actual flavour or texture. Just endless melted samey cheese. The cheesy fries seemed to have exactly the same cheesemagedon on top as the mac and cheese. The corn on the cob was extremely salty and the lack of any prongs to eat it with made it messy and inconvenient. This stuff seems hard to get wrong but that's somehow what happened. \u00a0 The music is varied and interesting and the desserts look pretty decent, but from what we experienced, the rest of the food is mediocre. The presence of a jug of tap water with no actual glasses to drink from sums up The Diner pretty well: promises much but fails on delivery.",

The Diner is a fine place to eat, but with none of the size, brevity, or indeed at times service of your average diner. Or, indeed, the price points - as Glen B. mentioned (are you actually from America?). He's wrong too, sadly - The Diner is a damn sight cleaner, especially food wise, than any diner, and the burgers feel less like they're going to cause your kidneys to explode. The servers have all the enthusiasm of Lurch out of the Addams Family, and can at times just forget about you. It's possible they were hired for their looks - who knows - but they fail to provide the (usually) quick and helpful service of a good diner. In fact, the place is predominantly black and red. Most diners are lighter colours. What the bloody hell are you all talking about? In summary, the food's generally good, a little overpriced, but this is about as much like a diner as I am like an Alsatian.",

We once had a surprise dinner for a friend in here and they sorted out a cake for us, and whipped in out right on cue.

I can say unreservedly that you should avoid eating here. The food is DREADFUL and gives UK cuisine a bad name - even when we're trying to copy simple American diner food, we can't get it right. Go eat at any number of greasy spoons nearby - Franco's on Rivington Street springs to mind - and you'll get MUCH better food, for a fraction of the price. The Diner charges criminal prices for junk. Not good junk, cheap nasty junk. We had to send our \"Diner Fries\" back as they were inedible. My partner's burger was awful, as was my halloumi burger. Seriously, guys. Step up your game.",

This time, however, I managed to drag some of my old housemates out for bite of good ol American breakfast.Despite a line out the door, we were seated within 10 minutes in a snug booth that screams out \"personal space? what type of quaint British notion is that?\" that is just typical of the American dash-in dash-out eating experience. That being said, while you do get close to your fellow diners (I leaned back and accidently knocked into the girl behind me), you can stay at The Diner as long as you want without being rushed (and getting free refills on coffee - typical diner experience). I always for for brunch, so will only speak to that part of the menu. The blueberry pancakes are fantastic. Light fluffy circles of dough with a very generous portion of fresh blueberries is a great meal to start your day feeling at least somewhat healthy. The side of oily spicy chorizo perhaps negated any such effects but screw it, I love me some chorizo.One down side is that our \"fresh\" orange juice tasted more like Sunny D that any sort of actual juice. In addition, the coffee is a bit weak but luckily you can grab a good strong espresso next door at The Bean which makes everything better.One of our party's orders was misplaced (exactly how this happens I don't know) but they quickly made it again and didn't charge us for it so all is forgiven.Overall, love the food, liked the service, hated the coffee, but I'll be back with an espresso in hand.",

It could be that I haven't eaten gluten for a year (hey, a gluten allergy doesn't count on vacation, right?) but these fluffy disks of comfort food hit the spot.

The bread was good, but the meat tasted like one of those cheap frozen patties that aren't even thawed before being thrown out onto the grill. The tomato wasn't fresh it was a little greasy overall. The fries were good, but also a little bit too greasy. Still, I left with a good feeling and will go back there, so it's more like a 3.5.

It's one of the only places that I can loiter, probably due to the bad service, for hours over once slice of apple pie and a coffee and not be bothered by a waitress trying to shoo me onwards.

As she doesn't like her food too spicy I was lucky to get her spicy mayo which was super tasty. The food arrived rather quick and the portion is just the right size. As extras we had garlic butter fries which were ok, until we found out we have a little puddle of garlic butter at the bottom, and then it was tasty.The sweet potato fries however are pretty good. I'm not sure if I liked my burger or if I was super hungry, but there was something missing in it for sure, just can't tell what it is exactly. What I didn't like is the service- the waitress came to our table to give us menus first, which is fine, and then again to ask if we're ready... We asked for a little more time, and she just kept coming every minute to ask if we're ready- I'll call you when I am! It was ok - but then she did it again when I was eating. First time to see if everything cool, but then she came around asking \"do you need anything else?\" About 4 or 5 times while eating and afterwards. If this is your way of making people go or order more - it's wrong. And it's annoying. I'd give this place 4 stars if it wasn't for that annoying waitress.",

Their shakes are brilliant (especially the ones that are spiked). The Diablo is super tasty. I had the cheese fries with burger gravy which went down well (and were a super calorie bomb to boot ;-). Wash it down with some cold beer, and you're either laying the foundations for a great night out drinking in East London, or creating sufficient lining to protect you from a night of excesses. It's not haute cuisine; it's not Hawksmoor; it's not Meat Mission or Meat Liquor. But it exists, it's nice, it's fun, cosy, and a great stop gap.",

The place is clean, the vibe is chill, and the food is really good. My friend and I each had one of the many burgers plus a side of the Chili Fries and the Onion Rings...and some wine, too, of course. It was a fun meal and I would totally go back, if only I lived in London. P.S. Ask your server what \"American\" sauce is...too funny.",

    "text": "After attending Yelp's Whiskey tasting event, I was feeling optimistic that this area could provide me with some good food afterward. With a crew of fellow Yelpers with me, we headed to The Diner for some grub.I could probably moan on for a fairly long time about our experience here, but in short, I had the worst breakfast burrito that you could possibly imagine (imagine a soggy, floppy flour tortilla filled with poorly scrambled egg, and some cheap and nasty chorizo) accompanied by a dribble of dead looking re-fried beans and another dribble of grey guacamole.The failures did not end there. We ordered a pitcher of Whiskey Sours for the table, only to find out that our \u00a332 only provided us with 4 1/2 full small tumblers of cocktail. So that's \u00a316 a glass, then, is? The menu price per glass did not even cost as much as the pitcher. When I mentioned this to our waitress, she treated us with a non-caring attitude and replied with a surly \"That's because you haven't filled your glasses with ice; do you want to speak to the manager then?\". So... The ice is the important aspect in a cocktail then?!? I was quite taken aback with the attitude and this was apparent when we were handed the bill - the old 12.5% service charge added to the bill! The scourge of good service in London!To be fair to the establishment, when the manager did materialize and after a lengthy conversation, he agreed to only charge us \u00a315 for the picture of ice! He was a nice chap, although it took a lot of wrangling to get to this resolution.Needless to say, I will not be returning to the diner in a hurry. Which is a real shame because I was hoping for some real American food and service. Well... If you are expecting that go elsewhere.",

Granted it tastes like Pepto Bismol but, what ever floats your boat!When you are craving brunch and you're in Old Street you head over to The Breakfast Club Hoxton. You get there and then you see the queue coming out the door. You're hangover seems to get worse as you panic... 'Think, think!' to tell your brain, 'there must be somewhere close by that can fix this sore head...' Then you remember The Diner. You hopes and spirits rise as you walk 5 minutes to the beacon of hope.The diner is great - expensive and staffed by up-themselves hipsters, but still great. Serving up a nice selection of American inspired food, you can slide you bum into one of their booths and receive a tasty meal. It's an open kitchen so you can see them grilling up your breakfast which I quite like, they also serve 'hard-shakes' so if you're feeling like a hair of the dog, you can add a kick to your meal. They also do tasty bloody marys, you'll just have to hand over 7 of your hard earned pounds to slurp away at one.",

    "text": "I arrived late, apologetically so, but having been waved with dispassion to the corner group of be-Christmas-jumpered rowdy cats in the back, next to the rows upon rows of other brunching groups in santa hats and others with crackers on the table, \u00a0you'd a thunk I'd stood up my server not missed the first round of Bloody Marys (they went down well as they were in fact rather good- my choice every time over a 'hard shake').My group, of caterwauling cats at the back, were only in festive spirits, not misbehaved. Of course, it was only me who brought to the table complications. Other wise what would I write about? I know I can be a testing diner for any server, however my poor pencil moustachioed man-server was merely run off his feet not mercurially presenting a lack of personality. For this he had plenty. So for brunch as usual, all I wanted was breakfast with a poached egg as soft as my Christmas temperament after watching 'Miracle on 34th St'. As the first eggs were laid on plates around the table, I noticed what seemed to play in slow-mo, the tension of the knives around the table plunge into powdery hard edged yolks and soldiers which were submitted to the reverb boing into an overdone egg, I panicked. Being the last to order I sprang out of my tables festive formation and alerted my sassy disinterested server of my need for a very runny egg. My poached order on fried rye and tomatoes arrived and was continuing to coddle in an iron pan, so it was with great urgency that I needed to get started. It came not quite hard boiled, thank god. Yet it wasn't soft nor cascading with runny yellowness. My h'angry party weren't as bothered about a soft egg as I am, but please breakfast chefs, get those eggy bad boys out of the hot water as soon as you say 1 Mississippi!! By the time it's sat under the serving hatch there'll be less chance for eggy disappointment. It was dangerously hardening by the second. But I needed Mustard. English Mustard. I requested Coleman's of course, Maille I'd have happily gone with, but the server replied \"There's Mustard on the table\", but I wanted English not vinegary weak American, ironically French's. The Diner brand's discourse was that, \"Hey This is Shoreditch, someone wants Soy Milk, the next person wants Almond, one guy wants Stevia, the next Agave, which we do have, would you like that\"... \u00a0\"Oh we've run out\" was the recoil, \"So where, does it end\". I would have preferred being creatively lied to, simply \"we've run out\" would've been better, but the reasons for no English mustard were weak when paying nearly \u00a320 for the novelty of a shabby New York diner style breakfast, for that much I want you to crown me with condiments. I've been to better burger vans on the coast with a better selection of sauces than here. I'm not a Christmas Killjoy, only I just don't get how the theme of a New York diner is so popularly impressive. To me, the epitome of a New York diner is being served by some sour-faced Betty near or over retirement, with well kept nails, hair complete with a hairnet and doily, serving up greasy food; stack em up pancakes, over easy eggs and terrible drip coffee, (The Diner's coffee was actually acceptable and with the US tradition of free refills being available, I'm surprised we weren't all rocking in our seats with how much caffeine we had coursing round the table), but why on earth would you want to recreate the model of a drab American diner experience, I don't understand. Bloody Shoreditch!To make it more of a novelty, kitsch uniforms at The Diner would be cool. (Like the City Cafe in Edinburgh) It is a little embarrassing being less chic than the server, I was wearing a Christmas Jumper though.",

    "text": "The Diner delivers when it comes to American-style pancakes, the choice of fries, good music and even some of its fancier burgers, but it's less impressive when it comes to milkshakes or when we were there, an accurate beer list.Seeking to maximise the moment, I opted for two dishes one after the other: an 'original' basic burger, milkshake and when those and a smattering of sweet potato fries left more room than anticipated after a long cycle across London, a high stack of 5 pancakes.The 'Original' burger was okay if a little uninspired. It tasted more well-done than medium, and the sauces could have been better. The milkshake was also slightly disappointing. Okay, but not as cold or ice-creamy as those from Byron, whom I consider to lead the milkshake stakes in London at present. My dining companion's 'Arch' burger on the other hand, packing pulled pork and montery jack was really good.So on it was to the high stack of pancakes. And they were impressive, certainly the biggest such stack I've seen in London. Five, inch-thick pancakes piled high, dusted with icing sugar and with an apparently bottomless (in that the waitress was happy to bring more at no extra charge) small bowl of maple syrup. I tucked in, and was captivated at the first bite. Alas though a stack this high was never going to be conquered by a few bites and eventually I had to concede defeat, about 20% short of the finishing line. Still, they rate as among the best and most genuine American-style pancakes I've had in London.The beer list was a let-down: notable on paper, disappointing in that they had less than half of the beers actually in stock. Apparently this was because they were refreshing their menu, but a couple of weeks on, and the online menu now seems to be 90% identical to the one when we were there. Hmmm.Other pluses were the decent music (various mixes of pop and rock classics) and quick, friendly service. The Diner exceeded my expectations, particularly for its pancakes and Arch burger. I declare myself a fan.",

I ordered chili cheese fries that arrived with the cheese already somewhat congealed and the conservative dressing of chili randomly had an oversized hunk of steak in it. I mean there's no straight rule to making chili but it was just kind of random and extremely oversized. The main gripe with the \u00a0chili cheese fries were: when I order chili cheese fries I want to feel guilty as hell after eating it. In no part of my experience do I want the delicious melty cheese to have a party without me!I ordered a fried chicken taco salad which came as a grilled chicken taco salad ( all good, I'm not one to send food back unless its disgusting ). The grilled chicken had some grill marks but overall was suspiciously wet for being \"grilled\". Considering all the food options in Shoreditch, I won't be going back here.",
