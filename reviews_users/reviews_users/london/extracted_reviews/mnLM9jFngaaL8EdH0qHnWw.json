    "text": "I read positive reviews on the TripAdvisor regarding Orsini, so while we were in London, and since it was close to the hotel, we went there for dinner one night.We made a reservation, and luckily we did since the restaurant was close to being full when we got there. We ordered a bottle of table wine from our friendly attendant, and then he showed us the specials.We had the starters: D had the linguini with mussels and I had the seafood pasta. For our entrees, we ordered the veal and the chicken.The pasta was cooked just right, and the seafood in the light tomato sauce was delicious. The veal was so tender and the chicken was so moist and tasty. The choice of the table wine was just right.For dessert we had the panna cota, which was OK. We ended our dinner with a nice coffee each. It was a lovely dinner.",

We split a salad (I forget which - I think it had verde in the name). It was simple, with lettuce and green veggies, and we got to top with our own oil and vinegar. I got the gnocchi, and it blew me away - perfect, fluffy pillows that sort of melted away like cheese. I wasn't up for drinks or dessert, although tiramisu was tempting... I definitely left feeling full and relaxed after a long day.",

That should be plenty of time for a drink, an appetizer and a main course. The wine arrived promptly, the bruschetta and eggplant appetizers arrive over 40 minutes later. They were tasty and well plated. The main courses- 2 seafood special and a veal had not arrived 80 minutes after we ordered. We still had a 15 minute walk to RAH so we left. They graciously did not charge us for the wine and appetizers but I have NEVER had such slow albeit polite service anywhere in the world. So, warning to future diners- beware and make sure that they understand any time limits. I was sad to leave as the ambiance was nice, the wine was good and it was comfortable. I am not going back tho. A sandwich at RAH sufficed for dinner.",

I've only ever visited for lunch and we're usually surrounded by smart families, shoppers and museum goers as it's only a couple of minutes from exhibition road. I like the food here because they keep it plain and simple, emphasising good produce and fresh flavours. The pasta is particularly nice and they do a really good gnocchi in white wine sauce. There are also daily specials and today i tried the chickpea soup that was very wholesome although it did only come with one small bread roll that was a bit disappointing. The coffee is great and of course they serve the Italian staple beverages; big, glass bottles of chilled San Pellegrino and strong coffees. The creamy hot chocolates are fab too.It's best for a quick brunch before hitting the shops as there service can be very quick if you tell them politely that you're in a rush. Three of us went in today and ordered prosciutto and mozzarella panini's, that were made with lovely warm crispy baguettes. More importantly, we were done and dusted in half an hour, even though the restaurant was full.",

Coming from the LA area we are rather spoiled with great food;Orsini did not disappoint. My mother and aunt ordered two different types of chicken, one with mushrooms and one with ham and cheese on top. Both dishes had a side of delicious green beans. They were both incredibly pleased with the dish. My dad got the Gorgonzola gnocchi with pears and it was probably my favorite of the four. The sauce was soo rich and absolutely perfectly executed. The gnocchi was the best we've ever had, even after eating gnocchi in Italy. It was sincerely melt-in-your-mouth gnocchi. I got my staple penne al' arrabiatta and it was delicious. Perfectly cooked and the sauce was perfectly spicy and complex. We also had wine, the tricolore appetizer, tiramisu, and panna cotta. All was delicious. Oh, and the service was excellent! Our waitress was so accommodating and kind. She answered any and all questions with a smile on her face. We will definitely be frequenting this place while we are in town.",

The service was still good due mainly to Fabio who was very attentive. However, the calamari was over cooked and had to be returned twice. We ended up ordering a different starter at the suggestion of our waiter. Overall, a disappointing meal for the price. It may have been a problem in the kitchen or just a bad night.",

    "text": "Was walking around after a full day of exploring and came across this little place. I looked it up on yelp and since they had decent reviews I decided to go in. I was greeted promptly by a very sweet Italian waiter. I got the menu and after a while of deciding what I wanted, I ordered a special seafood risotto and bruschette for starters. The bruschette comes with chopped tomato, an olive paste, and delicious roasted garlic. Each item complemented the other very well. Did I mention that the bread was delicious? Crispy, warm, and light.The seafood risotto came with prawns, calamari and the sauce was this creamy tomato sauce. It was topped with capers, which I felt wasn't needed but still AMAZING.All of this came to about \u00a320, which I felt was much only because the food took a significantly long time to arrive. After I was done with my bruschette, \u00a0I literally felt like I waited a solid 30 minutes for the risotto to come out. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious but I did wait a while. The risotto was also piping hot, so I wasn't quite as peeved, since it seemed like it was made fresh. My other gripe was that the service was subpar. All the interactions I had with the staff consisted of them having to come to my table. For example, seating me, taking my order, giving me my order, and giving me my bill. No one came to ask if I wanted anything else to drink or to see if I was doing ok, even though the table next to me had plenty of that action. With that all being said, the food was still fabulous and I'll give them some slack cause that's what Jesus would do. Overall, is definitely come back if I was given the chance.",

    "text": "Went here for a quick lunch with a friend who was passing through London, and it turned out to be a great choice. I ordered the king prawn risotto, and it was flavourful in healthy portions. My friend ordered a salad, and she enjoyed it as well. The cappuccinos were disappointing, however. I felt like it was plain black coffee with fake foams on top -- it could have been better executed. Service was good, and ambience was relatively cozy as well. A great place for a quick, solid lunch after a stroll around the museums!",
