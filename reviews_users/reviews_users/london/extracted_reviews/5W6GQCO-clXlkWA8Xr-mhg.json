I won't be going here again if I'm interested in a quick bite to eat.",

The place looked packed out but only just had time to nudge way to the bar before number 8 lit up on the efficient electronic board and was led away to nice little table tucked in at the back. Great atmosphere \u00a0intelligent, friendly and attentive service. Food however, was poor, cool as if it had been left standing and the meat pie contained mostly lumps of inedible gristle. Our favourite M Roux Jr would have said it was over seasoned (far to peppery, perhaps to disguise the quality of the meat \u00a0an old medieval trick that one). So, want speedy, friendly buzzy ambience with prices that are not astronomically and not bothered what is actually served, then recommended \u00a0but want a small touch of fine dining, find a handy cafe round the corner.",

They're probably paddling like heck in the kitchen to keep up with the orders coming in thick and fast - but it works. I've been to Browns on three occasions - Hen night, pre-theatre and birthday night and I've had a great evening, partly due to the food (it's perfect for that group night out or dinner for two if you're off to see a play or two). I had the chicken livers and brioche - very morish. Followed by the tagliatelle with crayfish and chorizo. It was tasty, just could have done with a bit more of the crayfish and chorizo and a little less pasta.The cocktails were just perfect. Mojito, Margharita, Pinacolada, I think we tried others too.If you want everything bar a quiet cosy night. Then this place will fit the bill. Talking of bill - that wasn't bad either.",

Browns was the place , in Oxford they all use to go. I think that sums up this place pretty well - it's well posh, and a little too posh for the likes of me. It's not posh in the great food sense, it's posh in the, stuck up people sense. A very British experience unfortunately!They do a few things well here, please don't take this as being a 3 star as a negative thing, their afternoon tea is superb and they have fish cakes to dies for. Ask for the hollandaise sauce with it as it goes soooo much better than the one they give you but really well made.Well done Browns, you Great British institution you!",

Also worth a try is their bar platters offer, My friends & I are huge fans of the 3 for \u00a312 and recommend the flatbread with Stilton dip & the prawns are relish tooHowever I am not so much of a fan of this branch as it is usually packed and sometimes the staff can be a bit offhand. I must say though a few months ago I ordered a cocktail that had looked & tasted fabulous in another branch of Browns but here it tasted completely different & to be honest disgusting, so I bravely took it back & asked for a new drink. To his credit, the bar man made me another drink & as far as I could tell did not appear to spit in it!",

    "text": "\"Luce, we're meeting at Browns on St Martin's Lane!\" I yell down the phone. She's cycling; I can hear the traffic. \"We're not eating there are we?!\" she asked, aghast. I couldn't see the problem as we walked into a fancy-looking bar/restaurant, desperate for a drink. The maitre d' said that there were tables available and we went for a drink in the bar to wait for Lucy. The drinks list is extensive with plenty of averagely-priced cocktails (the Bloody Mary was quite sublime) but, despite being the only people at the bar, the drinks took FOREVER to come - and the first round didn't even include any cocktails (they came later). They took so long that a very drunk man thought I was on my own and tried to get me to join him and his friends. I declined. Eventually, (and I'm talking 15 minutes), we got our drinks and Lucy showed up. We didn't let her get a drink before we went to our table as we would've been there all night. The service continued to be terrible. Each step of the meal (waiting for menus, waiting for the order to be taken, waiting for drinks, waiting for starters...you get the gist) took an exceedingly long time and poor Lucy was ready to drink the water that kept dripping on her from the air conditioning as she was so thirsty. All through the meal we were asking for glasses of tap water - which came, much to our hilarity, as we were settling the bill! Waiting to get the bill had me about ready to walk out as they were clearly not that interested in our paying. But being a good girl, I didn't. I did have to actually grab the arm of a passing waitress (I don't normally touch strangers...) as we had asked 3 people and waited a good 20 minutes and no bill had materialised. Physical contact seemed the only measure by this point. \u00a0But how was it? Um, it was OK. We had some very tasty bruschetta to start with and I had linguine with prawns and chorizo which was OK. It was OK, OK?But the service wasn't, it was terrible. Until we were paying our bill when suddenly these glasses of water appeared and 2 waitresses offered to take our photos (friends were visiting so it was a bit of an occasion, we don't normally take photographs of ourselves in restaurants). This became even more of a farce when my friend's doddery old camera got stuck on long exposure so we came out as blurry shapes, and we told the waitresses not to worry about it but they kept on snapping away...even though we were now desperate to leave after having been in there for some hours!An odd experience...I don't often use exclamation marks in my reviews but this definitely warranted it.",

All of my friends greatly enjoyed the experience and 2 of them returned on separate occasions with their respective families. The scones were soft, warm, and delicious (probably the best I've tasted in London!). There was a good assortment of pastries, which were slightly different but equally yummy between my visits. The tea and sandwiches were also tasty. For London, the price of afternoon tea was a steal, with no compromise on quality. The brasserie is large, classy, and well-lit, with an interesting layout, as it used to be a court. Service was a bit slow but that was to be expected at a busy time. Thank you Browns!",

It was late and we had our nieces with us so no one really drank so I can't comment on the bar items but the cuisine was overall excellent. Check out my pictures.",

I believe most people hit the bar then get the munchies and snag a table as there is always a 20/30 minute wait on tables.The food is ok and the staff always helpful, I have eaten in the upstairs private rooms before, I think it used to be a bank or the such like. The best tables are the booths as I always find the service better not quicker just more attentive. Perhaps it is something to do with the fact there are more of you so more spend and better chance of a tip or am I just being sceptical?Aside from the pre theatre crowd, post theatre crowd the after work drinkers at the weekend I have always found it easier to get a table at the weekend. Clearly if you are there during the week my advice book in advance otherwise be prepared to wait for that table!I like Browns and will continue to eat there on and off.",

    "text": "I came here for dinner the other night with a few friends. We were a party of 6 on a busy night and they were able to seat us rather quickly. The ambiance was classy and the restaurant was clean and spacious, but very loud. This restaurant seemed to be very strict about any changes to menu items or alterations to any of the menu items when ordering, so if you want to eat here then keep that in mind. My friend wanted to order the Browns Classic Burger medium-well and our server said that the burger could not be prepared more than medium-rare. I thought that this was very strange! As a carnivore myself, I totally understand and believe that beef should be more on the rare side because I think it tastes better that way. However, everyone is different! One should be able to have their burger prepared exactly how they want it prepared. Perhaps the restaurant can warn them that the temperature that they are requesting will taste less than optimal, but they absolutely should still be able to decide the temperature at which they want their burger prepared. Ironically, those in our party who did order burgers medium-rare and wanted them medium-rare ended up with very well done burgers. Needless to say, my friend who had desperately wanted to order the burger medium-well done in the first place, was not happy when he saw that others' burgers were well done.For the inconvenience, our server allowed us to use the check in offer (25% off when you book quoting yelp). Apparently this offer is usually only accepted for smaller parties, but they allowed us to use it even though we were a party of 6 which was very nice of them. We all really appreciated this because half of our party wasn't able to get what they really wanted off of the menu because they were very strict about the temperature at which they cook their menu items and about any menu changes. I was going to order the Cod and Chips, but our server told us that the tartare sauce came inside of the actual fish. I thought this was a little ambitious for me, so I opted for the Duo of Lamb (lamb cutlets and pulled shoulder lamb shepherd's pie topped with buttered mash, saut\u00e9ed samphire, chestnut mushrooms, and red wine jus). As for the lamb cutlets, I thought that these were a rather small portion. They were mostly bone and fat, so I got very little meat off of them. As for the shepherd's pie, this was excellent! Very tasty mashed potatoes and great incorporation of the lamb shoulder. It wasn't too salty, yet it was very savory, hot, and delicious! The saut\u00e9ed samphire was delicious as well and cooked perfectly, however, it was overly salty. The red wine jus is a real strength for them. It is savory and delicious! I wanted to put it on everything!I thought our server was friendly and I had a lovely conversation with him. I recognize that it was not his fault for being the barer of bad news when it came to the menu items or not being able to prepare the burgers how we wanted. He couldn't help it! However, he definitely could have helped his service. We waited for about 30 minutes to get our bill after we had communicated with him that we were done and wanted the check. We searched all over for him in the restaurant and he was no where to be found. We eventually asked someone else to have him come and deliver our check, but even then, we found ourselves waiting for what seemed like forever. When he finally delivered the check, the 25% discount that was promised was not there.Overall, the restaurant has nice ambiance, it's clean, some of the food is great but other menu items can be improved, and the service was very spotty. I doubt I will be back.",

They slightly screwed up the booking as we were meant to have a bar table for an hour then a restaurant table from 8pm, and they booked both tables in the restaurant. However they rectified everything and were very apologetic. Great service and atmosphere all around. The wine was good and the food was great! Yes it's expensive, but you get what you pay for. I had the duck salad, baked mackerel and sticky toffee pudding, which were all gorgeous. Good ingredients cooked simply and very well. It's really easy to find (literally just round the corner from Leicester Square tube). Would definitely recommend if you're in the area and fancy a treat of a meal!",

    "text": "Oh this was a bad decision - late on a Saturday night after the theatre in the middle of touristy land, we searched for somewhere with a spare table and ended up here. We walked in and were immediately told off for not checking in the hostess (who was not there). Then every table seemed to have some complex conditions around it. Eg. if we sat at the comfy booth, we couldn't have table service - we had to order at the bar. If we sat in the quiet part we could only choose from the bar menu, but could have table service. It was exhausting to try and find a suitable combination. When we did finally sit down, it was at a table next to the tills in the restaurant area (where we could have both table service and the full menu). For the first ten minutes that we sat there, there were dirty plates piled up about a foot away from us. Eventually when someone came over, I ordered the tomato soup and my friend ordered the fish and chips. My soup was cold and came with stale bread (to be fair, after I mentioned the bread, they brought me some more, warmed up). The chips were nice on my friend's meal, but the fish wasn't brilliant and the mushy peas were inedible. When we told them about the peas, they told us that it was their special recipe and although some people didn't seem to like them, they thought they were excellent. (Well, as long as the chef likes it, it doesn't matter about the customers, right?!) All in all, my feelings are that I shan't be returning, even if they do have the last table left in Covent Garden at 10.30pm on a Saturday night.",

Those aspects have certainly got me through the door, but it has been a quality drinks and good service that have kept me in their for longer than I otherwise would have expected!Speaking of service, customer service and staff here are all pretty good. The only criticism that I do have is that some of the staff do seem undertrained, especially when faced with making cocktails. I'm not talking particularly obscure or fancy cocktails - I'm talking staples like Martinis & Pina coladas. Other than that I am always happy with the service I received here at Browns.Speaking of drinks - they are all pretty tasty here! One of the great selling points of Browns is there happy hour specials where many of the cocktails are available for 5 Pounds before a certain time. Which for the quality of the establishment and the location I think is pretty good value!I have yet to try any of the food on offer here, but I would certainly not hesitate in future.All in all a good all-round experience here at Browns.",

I think servers are overworked or the restaurant is understaffed. They never come by and when one finally flags a server down they seem astonished that you need assistance. Bizarre.* Food takes forever to arrive. Forever. It took at least 1 hour to get dinner.* Food itself is average at best. The bread starter, while pretty to look at, was dry and stale. The penne with tomato sauce was just...wrong. (Ragu makes a better sauce.) Others in our group had the fish and chips and chicken breast, which seemed okay. I had the house salad, which I requested without edamame. Which of course came with edamame. * Ambiance is okay. But this place is VERY loud. So loud I couldn't hear half of what the person next to me was saying. The Bottom Line: Not sure why this place is so busy, aside from the fact that it's a great location. We definitely won't be back. Total let down.",

The drinks were cheap so I may come back to the bar with some friends and happy hour if I am nearby, but wont make a trek for it. We went last Sunday hoping for Brunch, but they stopped serving at 12, so we settled for lunch dishes. I had the Browns burger, which was dry and pretty flavorless (had better at Byrons) and my boyfriend had the chicken caesar, which was a pretty standard chicken caesar. It was all okay. The part that really annoyed me is they had a 25% off for checking in on YELP, we were heading here anyway so I decided to do it. We forgot about it when being seated, but told our waitress before we ordered. She said that she would ask her manager, which took 15 minutes. The manager then came over and looking all confused, said that she had never seen this before, but she would ask her other managers. She then never returned, which is just aggravating. Don't tell me you will look into something, but not follow up. We ate our meals, and then, when we asked for the bill we asked our waitress what the deal with the discount was. She looked at us all confused and said, \"My manager never came back?\" We said \"Nope.\"She went to check again about the coupon. When she brought our bill she told us that no one had ever seen the discount before and that they could not honor it.Browns, whoever runs your YELP account, needs to let the other managers on duty know if you are offering discounts. And really, Miss Manager, you looked at your Yelp page on my phone, saw the discount offered and saw that I did what was asked to get it and you still wont honor it? Anyway, I live in Soho, there are so many other food options out there I don't need Browns, and you probably don't either.",
