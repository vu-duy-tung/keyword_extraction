I went to a wedding here and not only could the room accommodate the wedding ceremony itself but we were ushered into a lovely bar next to it with balconies overlooking the river, fed very good nibbles and kept well watered by the staff whilst the room was transformed for dining. The meal itself was surprisingly good considering the number of people to feed and the staff were very friendly. If you're looking for a decent sized wedding venue in London then I would definitely check this out.",

    "text": "Went here for a nice Saturday night with friends meeting up for drinks and a bit of food. Had an overall great experience, got a table by the window (they are premium, get here early if you want a good spot to sit). The service was excellent, just turn up at the bar and within seconds someone asks you what you want to order even when the place was busy. They have a good selection of beers on tap too... So, now you think, why did he only score it 3, well its the food. The menu has some tasty options but are a bit pricey (for a pub). I scrolled down the bar snack menu and I decided to go for the \"Char-grilled chicken sandwich - with tomato relish, garlic mayo & chips\" at a whopping 10 quid (a sandwich in the most posh pub perhaps would cost 10-12, but in a place like this I would expect 7-9 tops). Though, I thought the price would give me something to remember, though what was delivered was more something that would give me nightmares. The sandwich was delivered fast. Nice, though too fast for the chicken to been prepared on a grill, more like a microwave oven, then it was in a hamburger bun (really cheap one), once slice of lettuce, a kind of mayo-relish that had been squeezed out of something you buy in the supermarket and then, the best on the plate, a kind of coleslaw that actually seemed to been done in the kitchen and it was actually quite nice. Now, I was in between 2 and a 3, but in the end I scored the whole experience a 3 as the friendly staff, the environment (a really nice pub) and overall a great venue. Also, I know they have a restaurant too, though if it was the same kitchen that shipped out the disaster I got in front of me then I wouldn't even consider trying the restaurant. My friends foods (hamburgers, fish etc was a bit of a hit and miss too I think, but I give it up to them to review). Anyway, long story short, go here for drinks and a good pub experience, but stay away from anything that the kitchen dish out.",

Trafalgar Tavern's prime, riverside location & view of the twinkling city lights is really to their advantage. We sipped on a few bottles of their white house wine at one of their outdoor tables by the river. Wine was just ok (it was house, so I wasn't surprised), but the Steak Baguette (Sirloin steak, caramelized onions, watercress w/ horseradish on a warm baguette w/ fat chips) that I had was scruuumtious! I had ordered it from the bar menu, but it definitely wasn't of bar food quality. Also, the chips were the best chips I've ever had. Way to do London justice.I noticed that others noted Trafalgar Tavern was dead when they visited, but when I went, the patio & riverside seating was packed. The interior was definitely not as poppin' given that it was a gorgeous, warm night out. All in all, Trafalgar Tavern set the scene for a memorable evening out!",

The thing that drove me and my friends to it was the outdoor seating on the riverside which made for a very pleasant summers evening relaxing and watching the boats go by and looking over at the docklands. The only downside to using the outdoor facilities is that you have to let them know at the bar which then means you have to drink from plastic pint glasses, similar to those you would get at a football ground. Whilst the reason for this is obvious, it did feel like we were being robbed of an important aspect of a pub experience. Inside is beautiful, you can tell that the place has a history from the paintings, the layout and the high ceilings. I particular like that you can sit by the window and, in a similar way to when outside, view the Thames and city. However there are only a small handful of seats in which this is possible to be quick and grab them whilst you can. Drinking at the Trafalgar almost seems like a unique experience. The summer outside is a must for anyone in the Greenwich area.",

Head down and take a look at the Maritime Museum, The University and to end this day trip head to this pub. It has been here for so long, has seen so many historic events and some crazy times that it's legendary. Don't miss the beautiful fire place, it has so much detail work.

Drunken rabbles hanging from the railings, loo rolls covering the place, fireworks launching from the windows. Alas the tainted babylon of my imaginings has yet to see fruition but this does make a well located stop off on the pub tour of Greenwich. At one point they were serving a savage ale called Nelson's Blood which had a fearsome kick to it's stride and could topple the best of men.. however I suspect they saw the insanity in keeping such a tipple so readily available to the masses. I've never tried the food at this place, but the views of the Thames are great and it's a nice pub to sit outside for a beer in the Summer. Staff seem a little cold and thus far that's what's held me back from venturing further with the food. Definitely worth a visit if you're out on a hot day though.",

Why the bartender did not beckon us over, I will never know. When you find a place to sit, you are expected to bring your utensils and napkins out to the tables yourself. The kids' lemonades were very small and heavy on the ice. While the burgers were tasty and juicy, there were bones in the fish that were the perfect size to choke on.

There were not a ton of vegetarian options but the ones we had were really good. \u00a0This place was recommended to us because of the view but the food was good too. There hot chocolate was good especially on a rainy day.",

This is a charming pub sat along the river with incredible views of the water, canary wharf and North Greenwich. It's a brilliant place to have a Sunday pub lunch or just a few pints. Just to watch the boats float by!",

    "text": "This is a touristy place with a great view of the Thames by Cutty Sark. The first time I came here I didn't eat and just had some Pimm's but their English pub food, albeit touristy prices, are actually quitegood.The fish and chips is likely one of the best I've tried in London (though keep in mind I haven't tried many) and their fishcake was also delicious. Their jerk chicken sandwich just as good. If you are okay with paying over 12 GBP for pub food because of the view (should you be able to find seats outside or by the window) it's actually quite worth coming. Personally I would not want to pay 16 pounds for fish and chips but then again, if you're reading this, you're more likely a tourist than a student at Greenwich U, why not?",

    "text": "Caveat that this is a review of the upstairs portion of what looks to be a pretty generic, if tourist-overrun pub. Regardless of the downstairs, the upstairs is an absolute gem.When my friends said their wedding reception was above a pub I was a bit dubious; imagining Only Fools and Horses style shenanigans, which did seem a little out of character. I shouldn't have worried about this, my first London-based wedding (I was so excited to get the tube to a wedding!) - this old Georgian townhouse's upstairs area is utterly beautiful and surprisingly large. Three separate areas - one cosy bar/reception area and two large dining rooms - made for a great reception setting and an even better dancefloor.The views were also pretty fabulous and there are balconies to pile out onto if vertigo isn't your thing. The sight across the river to the o2 is fabulous at night.Food was delicious and servers were all nice. This really was a special place to have an occasion - don't be put off by it's pub location!",

Then the completely forgot 3 orders now bear in mind we asked about our food 3 times before with no one coming back to us the. Final straw is asking again on replacing cold Yorkshire puddings and being given roast potatoes. Stay away from this place it used to be a gem of a restaurant but the service is horrendous,the good is mediocre and quite frankly you leave here feeling extremely stressed its disgraceful!!!!!!!! Just an update The 3 missing dished came an hour and a half after the other 7 dishes. Lunch with the family ruined!",

This is a beautiful pub restaurant in a lovely setting right on the river it has a well layed out restaurant and very nice friendly staff.The food was good, the roast beef was tasty not the best or worst I've had. They did forget my Yorkshire pudding and i had to ask for it and when it came it was very dry and bland. Im not a fan of cabbage on Sunday Roasts i dont feel it belongs, there are plenty of other vegetables that work better. So gotta drop marks for that.Its hard to find a truly amazing Sunday Roast there must be one out there in London, but here was not it but still a nice meal and enjoyable.",

    "text": "A tale of two cities indeed.This is one of my locals. I frequented this place so often after my classes at University of Greenwich that my lecturers should've just held classes here. The Trafalgar (as us locals call it) is right along The Thames - perfect views and so close you even get splashed on summer days.Tale 1 -- The downstairs of the Trafalgar is a pub. Yup a pub...towards the back is a restaurant (never dined in that bit). It's alright as pubs go and they serve Boddington's which is always good in my books. The features downstairs are the window seats. People jockey for these seats like Louis Hamilton jockeys for pole position, so if you get one - milk it. The loos could definetly use some attention which is a shame and the food is nothing to write home about because...Tale 2 - is the star of this show. The upstairs is where they hold functions. Some years back I organised my company's Christmas Party here. Amazing. This is, after all, a Georgian building and the upstairs is a stunning affair. 3 rooms - The Ante Room which is a smaller bar and lounge, the room just off that which we used as the reception/congretating area and the main feature - dining room! Heigh ceilings, floor to ceiling windows to show The Thames River in all its glory. The lights at night really sparkle on the water - gorgeous. The room is only adorned with plush curtains that are always drawn back and a piano. It's also quite spacious, to say the least. I was able to use one end as the dining/seating area and the other as the dancing area. They also have bespoke catering on-site, so that really made it a win-win!Personally, I don't hang out here anymore because the pub is just a pub and far too crammed on the weekends with tourists but if you want something special or planning a wedding, stylish party of 100+ then the upstairs is for you.#LiveLifeLikeLDN",

Everyone inside seem so friendly and I really like how you just walk up to the bar and order drinks and food at same time. First thing to try in London, of course, fish and chips and bangers and mash. I wish people knew how to make fish and chips here in the U.S. like they do here. It was light, flakey and crispy, not oily tasting at all. Sausage grilled perfectly and the mash was so creamy. Both dishes were super tasty!!!",

That fame is not always warranted and some very sorry pub grub is served up in establishments across our fair city. But not at The Trafalgar Tavern. For a Sunday party, I was summoned to Greenwich and had to whip out my GPS to find the place. Tucked behind the university, it has an amazing riverfront view. A huge pub, it stretches back from the big front room to the bar and a full restaurant. Fantastic selection of ciders and beers, and some festive mulled wine. The food was the high point for me, best fish and chips I've had in London. And relatively inexpensive. The roasts my friends ordered, from chicken to pork and beef looked incredible. These are roasts which have turned non-believers into devoted roast eaters. If it's a Sunday and you want a killer roast experience, a nice walk in a pretty place, this is the pub for you.",

So you can expect a long wait at the bar, to be standing outside unless you get down there really early, and for the restaurant section to be fully booked.Mind you, it is on the river. It does offer lovely views and it is a great spot for getting your drinks in the sun.Lower your expectations and you'll enjoy. There aren't many riverside alternatives in the Greenwich area.",

    "text": "Can't really add much to what has already been said about the Trafalgar Tavern. It's a fairly normal pub in an area steeped in history and architecture. What I will add is that the upstairs area, reserved for weddings and events is truly spectacular. I came here for a friend's wedding a fortnight ago and what an amazing main room there turned out to be tucked upstairs in this ancient pub. As you walk up the stairs there is a beautiful smaller room with huge bay windows, this leads to a smaller 'snug' bar which is truly cosy. The views from up here were simply stunning. Throw in a main room which has enough space for around 150 people plus dance floor space and it's a tidy little wedding venue.So, I did spend a bit of time downstairs whilst at the 'do'. But it seemed pretty mundane, lovely as it was. Anyhoo, the party was definitely going off upstairs and it's here where I believe this pub really, truly shines. If it's local to you, and you're about to get hitched, you'd be silly not to check out the facilities upstairs, they really are a pleasant surprise.",

The weather seemed to be cooperating, so a nice walk around Greenwich Park and the river lead us to this good sized, friendly tavern. Now the main event, the Roast. I got the beef, of course, and it was amazing. Possibly the best I've had in London. The meat was prepared perfectly, the potatoes, veggies and pudding were all a delight. They have a good selection of Sharp's beers, as well as a few other randoms, including Murphy's Stout. Definitely will be coming back here for a roast in the near future!",

Zooming past on our way down the Thames, the pub looked spectacular when lit up at night and from the vantage point of the river. That's certainly saying something when you take into account its location, sandwiched beside some majestic Georgian architecture.Once inside, however, I couldn't help but feel slightly let down. The Trafalgar doesn't seem to be able to figure out what exactly it wants to be. It looks like a yacht club from the outside, and even inside, the layout seems strangely spartan, and more like the clubhouse of a distinguished old boys bar than a venue open to the public.All of the furniture is either vintage or doing a good impersonation of being vintage. Red leather lining abound. Having said that, the bar menu looked quite appealing and seemed good value. The place is evidently popular too, with a decent crowd for a midweek night.",
