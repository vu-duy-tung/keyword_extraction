You then choose a variety of ingredients from rice, beans, meat/vegetarian, cheese, sour cream, guacamole and salsas of varying heat intensity. At Tortilla, you can order a medium (\u00a34.70) or a large for only \u00a31 more. Quick, fresh food with a smile for under a fiver- I will be going back!",

    "text": "In this world, you can't go far wrong with food that starts with a flat circle of stuff. Pizza is awesome. Pancakes are awesome. A kebab can get you through in a tight situation. Pasties are quite popular, and that's just a Cornish pizza that's been folded in half. And I ain't met nobody who would ever say no to a decent Burrito. Though Tortilla was a little hard to find initially (if you approach it from one direction all you can see are the signs for the Health Club rather than the source of Mexican goodness), and it looks like the kind of mainstream chainy type place that lovers of fine lunchtime cuisine tend to avoid - once you've tried their burritos I almost guarantee you'll be back. In fact, the ordering process on the 3 times I've been there in the last 6 days does have me wondering what element of the presentation I've missed. Despite signs around showing you what the workflow & options are, I still feel like the staff are making it up on the spot. But even then, IT'S SO GOOOOOOOOD! The food's fresh, tasty, affordable, healthy-ish, and did I mention tasty? I'm yet to master the art of eating a heftily-sized burrito without sending my Mexican spicy rice distributing itself all over the table and up the arm of my shirt. The chicken and the pork have been incredibly flavoursome - with that woody/smoky flavour that you don't get anywhere near with \"bing cuisine\". The restaurant - well you wouldn't really call it a cafe? - is quite spacious, and has all the atmosphere of an airport departure lounge, although to their credit they haven't spattered it with spray-on Tex Mex kitsch, preferring just to get on with the business of making tasty lunchtime nosh. These things might not even be very authentic, but damn they're good. I'm going back tomorrow.",

We decided to give this place a try after passing by it a few times. The set up strongly reminded me of Chipotle, and with fingers crossed I hoped it would cure my homesickness. I'll start with the creation of the burrito which was an adventure. The woman behind the counter got so many things wrong that she had to restart the order multiple times, and at a point we pretty much just let her continue making mistakes because we just wanted to eat. When we were finally able to chow down the two of us were hardly impressed, everything was cold and left us feeling nowhere near full. It was very disappointing, and so the search for good London Mexican food continues.",

    "text": "I go here quite regularly, and it's very variable.Everything from ingredient quality to portioning to quality of burrito-wrapping changes from visit to visit. The quality of the guac is generally a good indicator of if it's going to be a good day or not. If it looks unripe / pale / brown, get your ass out of there and come back another day.They do a fairly good cali-mex burrito--not quite as good as Daddy Donkey or anything you'd find in a decent Mission place in SF, but ranging from the just-passable to the pretty-damn-good.Would recommend the steak of all the meats; tends to be the most reliable. Juicy and often still slightly pink, it's generally pretty good. Probably not worth it for the veggies out there; thanks to the way they burritos are constructed and the extra-unreliabless of the guac and optional peppers-and-onions combo, you're likely to end up with a lukewarm and unsatsifying mess.++points for the chilli sauce, though -- be sure to ask for extra hot sauce (Chilula, generally) and fresh chillis at the end if you like it hot. They don't cost anything, but you have to ask for them specifically.They also get points for a great North American beer selection; it's a rare thing even in London to get Anchor Steam and Pacifico, which do go down a treat on a Friday lunchtime.",

Everything was so delicious, and the chips were warm and really salty which I love. It was also really filling so completely worth every penny. We went at 1pm and because a lot of people go for takeaway we got a seat straight away despite the long queue for service.My favourite thing about it? Free refills on soft drinks. I went a little overboard on the coke and got really full so be warned! The cups are paper though so when you leave you can take another gulp for the road, that is so rare for London. In a way I'm sad I've discovered this place so close to my house because I'll be here all the time now!",

Hot sauces.The Great: Jalape\u00f1os (Take a lesson Chipotle). \u00a0The tortilla. \u00a0Large windows and layout of restaurant.The Amazing: Being able to have something I consider Mexican food.I really think that his is a perfect 3.5 stars, but it's been a month since I've had Mexican so I'll give the benefit of the doubt. \u00a0Actually the extra half star is for the option of bottomless drinks and more importantly Cholula on the table. \u00a0I almost cried. \u00a0I'll probably go 1-2 a month. \u00a0Definitely better than the hat.",

You queue up and order your burrito how you like it, in a very similar fashion to subway sandwiches (except you're choosing between meets, cheese, types of rice and beans, choice of three salsas etc.). As a bonus offer at lunchtimes a bottomless soft drink is only 50p. Beers are also available. This style is something I've experienced in Mexican places in California, but not in London. You can opt for takeaway, but they offer a lot of seating on two floors as well. The restaurant itself is very clean and modern and is a pleasant place to eat. Quiet music plays in the background. They make a big thing about how all the ingredients are fresh, and their meets are home marinated - and I think this is really reflected in the quality of the food because the burrito I had was delicious. We arrived at 12:15 and there was not much of a queue. However we noticed that the queue built up quite a lot over the next 20 minutes so would recommend arriving a bit early. I'll definitely be going here frequently (I'll add more photos on my next visit)",

Ostensibly there to try their new range of American beers (to add to their Mexican ones), the real star of the show for me was their tasty burritos. Freshly prepared in front of you, they come with a choice of delicious fillings including lemon and coriander flavoured rice/Mexican rice, pinto beans, black beans, peppers and onions, sour cream, cheese, guacamole and various strengths of salsa (as well as a choice of meat fillings for the carnivores). Perhaps the beer tasting had given me courage, but I went for the hottest salsa and didn't regret it. The hot pepper sauce on the table also proved popular with the Qypers. On the beer front, they have an excellent range of American and Mexican: my favourite was Blue Moon, brewed in the Belgian style, which had a lovely coriander and orange peel flavouring reminiscent of the Hoegaarden style. I had severe Burrito cravings in the days following my visit here (I just wish there was a branch in Stoke Newington!). The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the slightly disappointing margarita, which was served warm to me. But ice was quickly provided on request. The service was very friendly and accommodating and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",

    "text": "Yeee-haa! The authentic taste of Americana - Mexican food that is! We visited Tortilla at Southbank as a group to try their newly-released range of American beers that help complete the Mexican experience. It was a hot afternoon and I for one was dying for a cold beer to quench my thirst. In the past their Mexican beers have been great ( Pacifico Clara, the ubiquitous Dos Equis, Negro Modelo and Modelo) but now with the choice of American artisan beers too, the range is huge!First we tried Goose Island India pale ale from Chicago, a malty, fruity light taste, swiftly followed by the smoother, creamier Sierra Navada pale ale from California. I love this beer as it reminds me of good times sitting on the beach in LA!Next we moved on to the Blue Moon wheat beer from Colorado, a light, Belgian-style beer that went well with my food later. Moving on the heavier stuff we tried the amber Brooklyn lager and the full-flavoured Samuel Adams amber beer. It was hard to decide which I liked the best - (especially as we were lucky enough to try the Mexican beers too) but I still think the Blue Moon folowed by Sierra Navada is for me. Easy to drink, summery and still with a strong alcoholic content, what more could I ask for! When it came to our choices for food, I decided on the beef burrito with black beans, rice and guacamole in a medium size. I can't imagine I would ever get through the large size at all, but definitely good to share with a friend.Others tried the pork burrito, chicken tortilla and corn chips with dips.I have to say the service was amazing, really friendly girls looked after us and was super-patient when we asked many questions on combinations and for their advice.Definitely a well-priced alternative to 'fast food' - the burritos were delicious, beers varied and interesting and I love the fact that you can buy a huge range of chilli and hot sauces there too. Well worth stopping by one of their many branches to try it for yourself.",

It is probably the closest equivalent to true Cali Mexican food you can get here in the UK.However, despite how much I love it, I don't feel I could rate this particular branch more than a two (and that's fairly generous).Being near London Bridge and having tons of businesses around means it gets extremely busy during lunch with the line resembling that of children awaiting school lunches from the line of staff operation different stations to help build a perfect burrito.Most of the staff in the construction conveyor belt are fairly happy and welcoming however there are those who just don't care and would probably suit being in a morgue than a customer facing role. But never mind, give me that delicious Mexican food!! Oh, wait... You're hardly putting any rice... Wait only a minuscule amount of meat!? HALF A TABLE SPOON OF GUAC!? I paid extra for that, LOAD ME UP!! Ok keep calm, slightly skinny burrito is in hand. Sauces and how it is cooked/seasoned should still make it good... Oh wait... Never mind. It's bland... Lunch ruined.It is still a good place to go for food but like the above says, this branch will just give you minuscule amounts of unseasoned and bland food served with a mood rather than a smile.",

I patronized a London Chipotle once and vowed to never return.Today I discovered Tortilla and finally satisfied my craving for inexpensive Mexican food! They essentially offer the same options as Chipotle, with minor differences:- Spanish rice (in addition to cilantro/lime rice)- Diced onions- Shredded AND chopped lettuce (oh boy!)Anyways, though the food isn't anything to write home about, I gave Tortilla 4 stars because of the price point. The medium burritos and burrito bowls are only \u00a34.95. It's much cheaper than it's competitor Chipotle, and affordable on my student budget. Also this location offers tons of seating on the main level and upstairs, or you can go outside and enjoy the views of Bankside.",

I always go for a \u00a0medium pulled pork burrito with tomato rice, black beans, salsa, sour cream, cheese and hot sauce. I think they do tacos too and there's also a choice of chicken, beef or veggie. They really do stuff the burritos full and don't skimp on anything. The only thing I'm disappointed with is that you have to pay extra for guacamole. Half the fun is eating a burrito. You have to make sure you take plenty of napkins as it's really messy, especially when you get to the bottom of the burrito and you have to take the remainder of the foil off. If you're not covered in juice and rice by the end of it, please teach me how to eat a Tortilla burrito!",

    "text": "I've noticed that most people are giving this place a 4 star or a 2 star, but the thing is, having had to search for a decent burrito across London and Paris because my boyfriend has a burrito obsession, I have to say that this is my favourite place. Not only is the flavour the best I have had (anywhere), but the price is also the best in Europe.\u00a35 for a medium burrito, \u00a36 for a large. For me, the medium-size was enough. 50 pence extra if you want steak instead of chicken or braised pork. If you want guac, it's 70 pence extra.The set up is exactly like Chipotle's: pick your food (burrito, fajita, naked), pick your meat (chicken, pork, steak, veg), pick your toppings through the assembly line of workers.The steak....wow...so flavourful and juicy. I've never had burrito steak tips so tastily marinated. The cut of the meat is not as tender as the one as Chipotle, which I personally love more because it's a bit more fatty and chewy.There's two types of rice: mexican (with beans) or cilantro. They ask you if you want beans or peppers (they don't have refried beans). I opted out of the beans and picked the peppers with cooked onions. Also very flavourful! Three types of salsa: mild (tomatoes and onions), medium (verde), and hot (roja). Other toppings: sour cream, cheese, lettuce (iceburg AND romaine), fresh onions, and jalapeno peppers.Also hot sauce at the table.Oh, and, um, refillable soft drink? Am I still in London?IMO, waaaay BETTER THAN CHIPOTLE'SYUMMY!",

It does exactly what it says on the tin: tortillas (as well as burritos and tacos, but you get the idea). I must admit that I am not a big fan of food you eat without cutlery, and this is essentially a very smart fast food chain (apparently there are branches in Islington and Canary Wharf as well). What is different is that the wraps are prepared right in front of you. The ingredients are fresh and delicious, and the staff are extremely friendly and patient (I asked far too many questions as i can never make up my mind). I ended up with the perfect burrito! On hindsight I should have gone for the smaller option, though, as it may well have been a little less messy.The theme of our event was actually a beer tasting (as illustrated by the pictures I just uploaded) as Tortilla has just introduced a selection of American beers not usually found in London. We sampled our way through half a dozen, followed by four Mexican beers. We all had our favourites, but they were all excellent and much stronger (all 5% plus) than most mainstream US lagers.Not sure if I would come here for a night out, but I wish a branch was closer to work as the burritos make for perfect filling lunches.",

Maybe it's because I was eating rice and beans before I could speak, maybe it's because I have always tried every tacqueria within a 20 mile radius of every place I've ever called home, maybe because the more my mouth burns of salsa, the happier I am. In any of those cases, let me tell you, Tortilla is one of two restaurants in London that can call themselves real mexican food.A few things to note: they have Cholula sauce, they have delicious fresh guacamole, they know how to do carne asada and shredded chicken very well, they give a guide on how to eat a burrito (since everybody in England eats everything from pizza to tacos to shawarmas with a fork and knife), and they make a decent margarita. All of this points to a very serious attempt to being mexican food to the flavorless UK. My margarita is raised to you, Tortilla.",

    "text": "Tortilla is a great little Mexican/Californian burrito chain with five or six outlets dotted about London and I'm very lucky to have one on my route home. This branch is on the ground floor of a modern building in Southwark Street just behind the Tate Modern. It has an additional seating area on the floor above, but this is only opened at lunchtime to cope with the swarms of hungry office types who are queuing out the door. It's a cafe like space; clean, tidy and efficiently run. You are not likely to want to linger for too long once you have scoffed your Mexican snackage but I guess that's part of the point. You will be as happy here as a solitary diner, a couple or with a larger party - I have visited with B and on also on my own. Anyway we popped in last Thursday night, I think it is open until 9pm, as we made our way along the Thames after sampling the delights of the Cologne Christmas Market on the Southbank. It always seems to be reasonably quiet if you drop in any time after the lunchtime rush and we received a warm welcome as we mulled over the menu on the wall by the serving area. Like most of the Mexican grill type places you decide if you are going down the burrito or tacos route, then move onto putting together your dream filling. I'm having a bit of taco love-in at the moment so I went for a couple of the little corn beauties, with the mouth-watering carnitas pork which had been slow cooked to within an inch of its life. I built this up with some hot salsa, Monterey Jack cheese, sour cream and shredded iceberg lettuce. B went down the burrito route and had a bad boy stuffed with pork, rice, pinto beans, cheese and a good hit of the medium salsa. A bowl of the freshly made, very zingy, guacamole with a bag of the excellent tortilla chips on the side and we were good to go. This is mighty, mighty fine fast food using excellent ingredients and lovingly prepared. There are large bottles of chilli sauce on the table should you need it and there a few foodie bits and pieces you can buy to take home should you fancy making your own Mexican feast. If you are in the mood for a beer then you are in luck as they have an excellent range of both Mexican and American brews. I had a bottle of the Anchor Steam Beer and B washed the bad boy down with a lovely Mexican bottle whose name has completely slipped my mind (not the usual Corona or Dos Equis so I will have to make a return visit to check up on this slight omission!!) Three quarters of an hour later we left wearing a couple of very big grins with our hunger nicely sated and my wallet less than \u00a320 lighter \u00a0result.",
