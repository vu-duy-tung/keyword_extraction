We were greeted by a rude hostess at the door who sat our party at 10 - we had reservations by the way - in a small table that could only fit 6!

Food was great and the most awesome part was the bill.If you order between 5pm and 6pm, you get 50% off your bill.If you order between 6pm and 7pm you get 25% off your bill.I will be going back on a tuesday as it is paella night for \u00a38-50 per person. hope to see you there.

If you go with a big group it makes sense to book, especially is you plan on eating, even tapas. The staff were helpful when we rang to book space, giving us the flexibility we needed with the numbers! Tapas is great, though can end up being a bit pricey as the dishes really are just snacks to share. The paella night (Tues I think) was good value if you like seafood as the dish is HUGE! Thursday is the best night for drinking as it's happy hour all night when the delicious (and strong) sangria is on offer. There are usually lots of people then, so expect to stand for some of the night, if not dancing the whole time!",

I visited this place twice while in London and one of those times was for NYE and I had a blast. The bouncer was always smiling at me and I constantly was running in and out and he remembered who I was. The coat check lady is friendly and coat check is free, she works off of tips so throw her a pound or so. The bartenders are very cool and drinks are standard price but they do have some specials on their chalk board so chedck those out. The music was awesome, the DJ's played a bit of everything from Top 40, hip hop, trance, spanish. They sell Sangria by the jug and it tastes great. The inside is very low lit and has a dungeon feel to it, it's a good size, with one dance floor but really it has two dance floors on opposite ends. I did not try their food so I can't speak on that but the place gave me an overall good vibe and I had a fantastic time!",

My first impression was surprise, I'd walked past S&A loads of times before and I had no idea that there was such a large venue underground. It's well decorated in a fairly typical tapas restaurant style, and there's a real buzz about the place. Service was really fast and friendly, and they made some great recommendations from their tapas menu. On the whole, the food was very good although it was a bit on the expensive side and I certainly couldn't describe the portions as generous! And the After Work Deals offer certainly helped manage the cost. Nonetheless, for the overall atmosphere I would still recommend Salvador & Amanda.",

At night the place converts into a club where dancing and drinks are on the agenda.Usually you will have to pay a few pounds at the entrance, but ocationally they will let you in for free. That is, if they let you in at all. You see, they have a very strict door policy - you are required to look stylish. But if this is not an issue, then, by all means, go there and enjoy an evening in gearish surroundings.The music played there is house, funk and suchlike tunes.",

It is really a crossover between a restaurant, bar and nightclub and although this may not sound appealing, it really does work. The drinks are not cheap but the service is good and the range of authentic drinks is above average. The door staff can be quite strict so mixed groups and no jeans is almost a rule, especially on Saturday nights. The crowd is mainly aged between 25 and 35 and the door policy pays off once inside as the atmosphere is always pleasant. The music is a mix of funk and disco with house beats and every available space becomes dance floor when it's late into the night. If dancing is not your thing however the bar and club is lined with comfortable table seating- which is always in abundance.",

Kind of replaces the old and dearly departed Bar Madrid, except at a more classy level! Drinks are reasonably priced for this premium location (Covent Garden/ Leicester Square) and are very Spanish/Latin focussed, with Sangria from Spain and Pisco Sour from Atacama - both were phenomenal, being prepared by the very skilled and amenable Latino/Spanish bartenders they have there.",

The constant stream of Latin music and the twenty- to thirtysomething crowd give it a nice buzz; the candles and dim lighting also help to make the place feel a bit more chill. Considering its proximity to Leicester Square, I'm always surprised by this (or perhaps I've just been lucky!) Finally got to try out the restaurant over the weekend, and really liked the seating area as they have some tucked away areas where you can have an intimate conversation away from the noise at the bar. The food is decent, depending on what you order, but possibly a bit overpriced. The chorizo was a hit amongst my group, but the patatas bravas were distinctly unimpressive. I have yet to find a tapas place that consistently impressed me though, so I guess it's not extraordinary in that way. If anyone has recommendations, send them my way! I'm on a mission now",

I say pay day Friday as the drinks in there are a tad pricy and you come out having spent a lot more than you would have thought. Service is good with lots of seating, not such a big dance floor but it's a Mingling place if you catch my drift. Open till about 3-4am and I think they charge around a fiver on the door.

Happy hour sangria was \u00a310 for a pitcher which was reasonable and delicious and the music, the mixture of Latin music and general pop provided a great vibe for some apr\u00e8s-work dancing.

I usually come here with Tastecard to enjoy 50% off my meal.The first time I came with 3 friends and sat on the table bang in the middle of the restaurant, it was a nice alcove area for us only and we enjoyed the experience immensely. The tapas were great and service was pretty good too.The second time I came during a footie match (world cup I believe!) where Spain was one of the teams. This was the best experience ever as you can tell all of the other clientele were supporting their home team and the restaurant had brought in 3 gigantic TV screens so its patrons can watch all the actions in its full glory.The third time I came for a friend's birthday party for a few drinks and experienced the \"late-night clubbing and drinking scene\" of the restaurant. The bar queue was slow but the music was decent, although there was not that much dance floor space. This is a lively bar however and they have a late night licence of 3am and as they are right next to Leicester Square station it might be a good hangout for those late night drinkers.I went again last year before going to a movie and the experience was disappointing. I had a group of about 10 people and the food was very slow to come, very small portions (compared to my portions from years before) and was just mediocre. The service could do with some improvement as well, such as letting us pay quickly please! (we were in a rush!). I would have given this place 4 stars from my first experience but this has now dropped down to 3 due to the latest experience.",

I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the other Yelp reviews which made it sound expensive and a bit naff. Read on...! We had a table of 10 and I believe we had some kind of taster menu. First things first- the meal was bloody good value- we got a \u00a0selection of tapas, meaty snacks and then a paella. No, it wasn't the best tapas in the world, but if you wanted great spanish food, you'd go to a tiny little tapas spot somewhere in Soho (or barcelona). \u00a0We then had birthday cake which was brought by a friend. They put a whopping great big sparkler in the cake which pleased my immature self. Including wine and sangria, the meal cost 33 quid per person. If you like old skool music, this place offers a lot- we were winding back to the early 2000s with Nelly, R Kelly. Great for a girls night out and I actually really enjoyed it.Downsides: the cocktails were a bit shoddy, the bar drinks were a little expensive and it was blindingly hot (we were all sweating like maniacs all night).

The boys had beers of various varieties. I had a fabulous cocktail (\"El Torido\" or something like that) which was delicious and quite strong. The food was quite tasty. My favorite being the ham & cheese croquettes. Others in my group had things like chicken wings and mussels and chorizo and enjoyed them all. \u00a0For dessert I had the fried banana - amazingly delicious.The service was impeccable. One person kept checking on drinks. One took tapas orders and one delivered tapas. We were checked up on throughout the night to see if we wanted more food or drinks or anything at all. By the time we left it had gotten quite busy, but the service stayed constant. Yes, it's a bit pricey. But it's Central London. That's to be expected.

As we were going in, a well oiled group of people told us that the lamb cutlets were absolutely delicious, but we didn't fancy lamb so you'll have to take their word for it. We did fancy the deluxe sangria, however, with its cava and strawberries, and I still fancy it now (\u00a319 a litre's not bad, is it?). Noms. We had asparagus, which was nice enough. Not sure what the orange smear was, and mushrooms, which were seasoned really well, and then scallops (10/10) and the tiger prawns with the shells off - slightly overcooked but still tasty - then baby chorizo and the best goddamn chicken wings I've ever tasted in my life. How I'd cook chicken wings if I could, and if I had the inclination. So, so good. We still had a pudding shaped space in our tummies so Steve had the creme caramel and I had some kind of spanishy chocolate cake which had cream all around like a moat. Delicious. The bill came to \u00a376 including service charge - reasonable for London I guess, but about \u00a330 more than we pay in Leeds! Definitely a great place to come if you like tapas - ideal for small groups, couples, anything really. I've knocked a star off though because Steve found the toilet attendant a bit off-putting. Not sure if that's cos we're country mice and it's the norm in London restaurants, but not something we're used to and not something we like. Sorry Salvador and Amanda : (",

    "text": "If you love eating out and haven't got a Taste Card (tastecard.co.uk ) yet, you absolutely must. Salvador and Amanda is one of the places where you get 50% off food Monday-Thursday so that's how we discovered this place, which is a stone's throw from Covent Garden and Leicester Square stations. This is one of the few tapas bars I've been to in the UK that has a genuinely Spanish feel to it. It's underground, it's candlelit, it's warm, it's ambient and throughout our entire meal we were accompanied by a guy playing Spanish guitar on a little bandstand in the middle of the restaurant. All of which made for an incredibly pleasant dining environment. I'm not shamed to say that between four of us we TOTALLY pigged out, ordering the Tortilla Espa\u00f1ola, Patatas Bravas, stuffed peppers, mini tuna pies, grilled queen half shell scallops with crispy Iberico ham, pan-fried baby chorizo, meatballs in tomato sauce, chicken wings roasted in lemon and chilli, chicken breast wrapped in Serrano ham... oh, and a lovely bottle of wine: the Terrassa Tempranillo Spain 2009. The best bit? With our Taste Card discount, all of that cost us \u00a319.50 a head. Not half bad for dinner in central London, eh? The only downside of the place was that the service was a little slow, despite it not being that busy. We had to walk up to the bar every time we wanted to get the attention of a member of staff and our dishes were all served randomly and at different times. However, seeing as we got such a great bargain on the Taste Card, we didn't make a fuss. I wouldn't have been so happy to overlook it had we been paying the full price of about \u00a340 per head though.",

We had high hopes from the way the place looked.However, it was all show and no substance. The food really does need to be worked on. We tried the ribs, chicken wings, shrimp, calamari, and fried sea bream- and they all ranged from average to nasty. Ribs needed more sauce, chicken wings were bizarrely hot on one end and cold on the other, shrimps were overcooked, the garlic sauce with the sea bream was waay too strong. The calamari was actually ok- the breading was salty and pretty good- but the calamari \u00a0was almost non-existent.It seems like an ok place to come with a party- if you don't care too much about the food. But I \u00a0don't think I will be back.",

    "text": "S&A is very cool space, well-decorated with interesting elements in a subterranean space of Covent Garden. Mosaicas on the walls of Spanish inspired geometric figures and winding vines encircling the gazebo in the center of the room really create a ethnic feel. I liked the fairy lights dangling from the roof of the 'chalet' which is a log cabin and the 'carousel' booth area as well. Impeccable decorations with large red columns, old-style framed pictures, vintage mirrors fixed upon a rough exposed brick gives it a rustic feel of sipping sangria in Spain.We had a great deal here for two which was something like 45 quid for a 4 course tapas tasting menu to share with a glass of bubbly along with a flamenco show which is normally 45 each! The staff was polite and quick and the extra jug of sangria was nice but rather weak. The food was just okay, and I figured out why fairly quickly. It appears that on a certain day of the week (Tuesday, Wednesday, Sunday) they have this deal, which means the place gets packed and the food is a set menu for everyone, meaning quality bows to quantity. The menu was quite seafood/fish heavy which I am not used to with tapas. All the classics were there: ie patatas bravas, ham croquettes, chorizo, salmon with pea puree, tuna filled pies, \u00a0and Andulasian crispy calamari, manchego for with choice of dessert etc. However, the first sharing course was just bread with olives which always puts me off as being an actual course. Also, the flamenco show was a bit disappointing. The woman who did the entertaining was clearly very technically good but the 'stage' area was a tiny platform and she was not very artful or impressive in terms of showmanship. It just wasn't the young, spicy, enthralling dancing we were expecting.That being said, happy hour here is killer. Monday-Friday 5-7-2 cocktails for 10 quid-4 bottles of beer for 10 quid-bottle of house red/white for 11 quid-litre of white/red sangria for 11 quidWould definitely come here for a chat with friends a couple bottles between us in a superb atmosphere but wouldn't replay the food situation.",

We weren't sure if we had to order at the bar or if there was table service. There was roughly 6 servers on the floor and each of them seemed busy. We decided to order drinks at the bar - which took forever. The service was not great but they made up for it when the maitre D gave us another round of happy hour drinks after happy hour was finished.On a lighter note. I rather enjoy the dramatic curtains and decor of the place. Very lush and romantic. They have live traditional music and dance in the evenings.

Once my eyes had adjusted to the gloom - which took a good while after the brightness outside - I saw that several others had done the same thing, with most of the tables in the bar area either full of eaters/drinkers or with a reserved sign.The place itself reminded me of something out of the medieval zone on the Crystal Maze with rough stone walls, flickering candles and red drapes. There was a distinctly fishy smell when we first walked up to the bar, so we walked around to the far side and pulled up a few stools. We were served immediately as it wasn't busy.It was great to see they haven't lost their heads when it comes to prices and the drinks were reasonable for the central location. We went for a litre of their traditional sangria which gave the 4 of us about 2 glasses each over ice. It tasted pretty authentic too, and not like some sugary syrup they'd just diluted.Not sure I'd stick around to eat in such a brooding setting but a fine choice for a quick drinks stop before stepping back blinking into the light.",

It's located very close to Leicester Square tube which is hand - I can't believe I've never spotted it before.Our waiter was very helpful and told us that two - three dishes person is usually enough. He also recommended a delicious lamb dish to try.We picked our favourite and ate whilst chatting away, also sipping at a bottle of house white wine which during happy hour was only \u00a310!All of the dishes were tasty, plentiful to share and nicely presented. I'd recommend the ham croquettes and the squid. Yum!We finished off the meal by sharing a plate of Churros and chocolate sauce. I definitely couldn't eat a whole plate on my own, but perhaps if you have a sweet tooth you'd love it!All in all the meal of 7 sharing plates, 1 dessert and a bottle of wine came to \u00a342 (including tastecard discount).

    "text": "This is one of those places where I don't really want to review it as I want to keep it secret so it doesn't get even busier! But, what a fantastic hidden gem! My friend booked a table for three of us for dinner after work one day after she'd heard about it from some other friends. I'm so glad I know about this place now - it's a short walk from Leicester Square tube station but I'd never noticed it before. We went in down some stairs into an underground restaurant with so much to look at. There's even a bit of a log cabin in the middle with tables in! We were half an hour late for our reservation but they were fine about it. I'd definitely recommend booking as most tables were reserved. We were seated at the back of the restaurant which was cosy as all the tables were full despite walking through an otherwise empty restaurant. It was plenty big enough for us and not too noisy.It was happy hour from 5pm-7pm and we were pleasantly surprised to see they had house wine for \u00a311 per bottle during this time. We ordered the chardonnay and he told us the menu was wrong and it was actually just \u00a310..bargain! I don't normally drink chardonnay but it was one of the best wines I've had out in a while. Very drinkable with no acidity to it. I just regret not paying attention to the bottle to see what it was!As this is a tapas place, we asked the waiter how many dishes would be about right for dinner. He suggested 2-3 each but that we could always order more after. We went for 6 between the three of us and it was about right. The waiter recommended the lamb dish to us as well as the calamari, then we also had some cheese and ham croquettes, chorizo with butter beans, patatas bravas and a goats cheese, beetroot and walnut salad. It was all delicious and cooked so well. I love meals where you get little bits of lots of things but with this meal you got a good amount of lots of things so even better!We were pretty full by the end but couldn't resist the churros with chocolate sauce so we had that to share. It was fairly big and I probably couldn't have managed it to myself, although I would have given it a pretty good go!We had booked with a taste card do the good was 50% off making it a real bargain. Really good quality, tasty food in a fantastic place with a great atmosphere and helpful staff and including the wine and service it came to less than \u00a315 each with the taste card!I'll be back again soon for sure, maybe in a bigger group to get to try even more of the menu and maybe book a table in the cute wooden cabin!",

    "text": "Had a great night at Salvador & Amanda, great music, reasonably-priced drinks (especially for the central location) and they keep serving food til late! That last part is a real win in my book, as I tend to be a massive grazer while drinking, and I'd much prefer to buy some small plates at the bar than have to sneak out for a cheeseburger.We went as a group and booked an area for 15. I had to put down a \u00a350 deposit as it was a Saturday night, but that was ok. I didn't like having to put my card behind the bar in order to get the \u00a350 back though, that is way too dangerous on a big night out! But I managed to get it back just as it ticked over to the \u00a350 mark so all's well that ends well I suppose.",

Music is fun and they have dancers certain nights of the week. \u00a0 The food is good...not amazing, but good for the price. \u00a0The drinks are great! Their house red sangria is phenomenal! \u00a0Get a pitcher! \u00a0Our server was great. \u00a0Unfortunately, \u00a0they messed up our booking and weren't very nice about it.. trying to say it was our mistake. \u00a0And 2 groups came in behind us and they messed theirs up as well. Nice it was sorted (had to change tables) it was fine. I'd definitely go back...great place for a group of people for light food and drinks!",

    "text": "Last night was my third time at this hidden gem, and it's a world away from the tourist trap that is Leicester Square. It's also a cut above the other Salvador and Amanda branch in Bloomsbury, which while perfectly adequate lacks the cosy atmosphere the Covent Garden one evokes so well.Having a tastecard makes this place amazing value (6 of us ate and drank a few glasses of vino for just \u00a314 each). Their Mon-Friday happy hour includes:- A bottle of wine for a tenner - a jug of sangria for a tenner - two cocktails for a tennerThe black rice with squid is some of the best I've had in London, the potatas bravas are more-ish and I also especially love the chicken wings and ham croquettes.The prawn dish had literally about 4 or 5 tiny prawns so that was slightly offputting, but all in all the dishes are worth every penny.The flamenca nights are fun although the stamping of the dancer reverberates a bit too much for my liking when I tried to have a convo with my friend!I'll definitely return here again and again :)",

They have dancing, great food and bevies and the ambiance is unusual and fun. \u00a0its one of those places that ststts as a restaurant and sort of converts to a nightclub as the evening continues :) \u00a0Will plan to go back the next time I am in London.",

    "text": "I'm not sure who or what this place is trying to be. I think it's a Spanish restaurant bar but there was a loud Dj while people were eating so perhaps it's a Spanish eating club?The music was very good, so much so I had to go over and compliment the Dj on his choice of tunes. I'm not really sure what I think f this place but i wouldn't write it off. I love that it is light mostly by candlelight and I enjoyed the use of space - lots a alcoves a raised areas.The Sangria comes by the jug, but it wasn't Sangria as I know it, this one was (I was later enlighten) Hollywood Sangria... hmmm! It's much sweeter and tastes a bit plastic fantastic to me - more E numbers and less wine!The jury is still out, so perhaps I'll have go back {sigh}, sample some other cocktails {sigh}, and see if I can't update this review and no longer sit on the fence. Although after a few I think I'll probably resemble Humpty on his wall! Hard life but somebody has to do it!",
