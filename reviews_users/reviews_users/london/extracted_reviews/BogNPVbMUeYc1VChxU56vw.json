From the pre-meal snacks with a selection of mouthwatering dips all the way through the fantastic black pepper soup, the potato balls, the Dosa, one of the incredible and unusual curries (although perhaps it's best to share the creamy aubergine number as it's TOO rich), the delicious side dishes.tmarind or lemon rice.the list goes on.i've only had desert here a couple of times as i'm usually too stuffed, and the large bottles of Cobra don't help.

The decor is very pink and very Indian, creating a warm inviting atmosphere. The staff are super friendly and efficient and if your not sure what to order will always reccommend something delicious! I suggest rounding of your meal with the mango kulfi - mmm! Oh almost forgot - it is also amazingly cheap! Some of the curries are only \u00a33 - \u00a34 ensuring you can sample as much of the menu as possible even if your on a budget.

Even better that Rasa is not too expensive, completely vegetarian and serves subtly spiced Keralan cuisine. The flavours tend to be provided more by tropical flavours such as coconut and banana than by any overpowering chilli, so its safe for those of a more delicate palate. The staff are very nice and seem used to patiently explaining what each dish is. On my first visit, I was extremely impressed that our waiter actually recommended us to reduce our order by about a third because we would simply have too much. The menu's prices suggest that the dishes are small but they are anything but. Highly recommended.Take note that unlisted in the opening hours are the opportunity for lunch at the weekends - noon until 3pm on Saturday and Sundays.",

    "text": "This is a restaurant which is reportedly one of the best for serving South Indian food. It has proved so successful that there are actually now eight venues spread all over London. In fact in Stoke Newington, the site of the original Rasa, there are two alone - right across from each other! Rasa N16 in Stoke Newington is a bit of a journey to get to but worth it. Especially when you consider the premium on the prices on the more centrally located venues. We were feeling hungry so nearly everything on the menu was looking good to us. We started off with a Masala Dosa which is a thin pancake filled with a spicy potatoes mix and served with sambar and coconut chutney. Along with this we sampled a number of starters (descriptions from the website):- Bhel Mix. Fresh crispy chickpeas, bhel, sev, peanuts, onions blended in spicy tamarind juice and freshly chopped coriander leaves.- Medhu Vadai. A spongy dumpling in a crunchy case, made from urad beans and chillies - served with coconut chutney.- Banana Boli. Plantain slices dipped in a batter of rice and chickpea flour seasoned with black sesame seeds, then crisply fried. Served with our specially prepared peanut and ginger sauce.- Rasa Idli. Steamed urad dal (black lentils) cakes topped with chef's speciality mixed vegetable masala. Served with coconut chutney.- Kathrikka. Finely sliced pieces of aubergines are dipped in a special batter, blended with coriander and chilli, before frying. Served with a fresh tomato chutney. We were also going to order a curry and rice but our waiter was like, maybe you should eat the dosa and starters first and see how you feel. Good advice indeed. That didn't stop us trying a couple of desserts though - a rice pudding (Pal Payasam) and semolina sweet (Kesari) served with mango ice-cream. Everything we ate, with the exception of the Rasa Idli which was fairly tasteless and quite dense, was delicious with my favourite savoury dishes being the Dosa and Bhel Mix (good use of tamarind juice.) Service was very friendly and quite efficient and they didn't hassle you unnecessarily, which makes for a nice change. Its also great for vegetarians - I didn't even miss my meat tonight! Surprisingly good value for money.",

I hate being seated against the window of an empty restaurant- it's always uncomfortable to have people looking in, staring at your food and weighing up whether it's worth popping in. There was a little fuss when we asked to move tables but to give Rasa its credit, they shifted us over fairly swiftly. We shared a poppadom selection which was great but spiced chicken chutney had an unpleasant foamy texture. The two vegetarian curries we ordered were very tasty but we had to choose from half the selection we could have had across the road. Sharing an over sized beer kept the price down to a reasonable \u00a310 a head. All in all, good, but not great, try Rasa Vegetarian instead!",

    "text": "So went here after having been to the veggie restaurant across the street. Once seated i checked yelp. Reading the reviews i thought disaster! My craving for meat had led me astray from the veggie delights over the road. This however i found not to be the case.My girlfriend is a vegetarian and so the idea of having a restaurant which caters with top notch vegetarian food couple with meat dishes for myself is right up my street. The restaurant got busy fairly quickly (we were here at 7pm on a sunday eve) but easily got a seat. I am giving this 5 stars purely because i feel i need to help up the ranking to at least 4 / 4.5 which the food itself clearly deserves. The waiters were friendly - okay not going to win any awards but being polite is fine enough for me. Food was prompt and not to mention good value. How does it compare to everyones favourite across the street??? My own humble opinion - actually better. Don't get me wrong i loved the veggie food over the way but i found that an hour or so later i was hungry again. This place served up equivalent veggie dishes but its meat and fish selection left me with a full feeling that i simply did not get from the veggie curries. The prawn starters here are an absolute delight - i followed this with the chicken curry which was lovely. Next time i'm down for the crab! To be continued... High five for meat",

I cant recommend this restaurant enough and aim to go there as often as possible, at least until I have eaten everything on the menu several times over and befriended the staff for recipe pilfering possibilities. \u00a0For food this good, the prices are ridiculously cheap and quite frankly this restaurant makes a mockery of Brick Lane and its non specific, often very low quality Indian fare.",

The pink decor and heavenly aroma of curries is similar, but Travancore specializes in seafood and meat from Kerela. The cuisine is focused more on fish and seafood, as Kerela is mostly on the coast. I had an amazing lamb curry here, marinated and in a lovely spicy broth. Wow! was my instant reaction. I love being surprised by really good food in London, and at affordable prices too. The staff are lovely, the bagar baingan I wanted was only being served in the other restaurant, but our waiter even offered to go over and bring it for us. We didn't take him up on it, but the thought was nice. You can also bring your own bottle of wine inside - a winner on all counts!",

I've eaten plenty of authentic Indian food cooked by friends from the sub-continent and in India, well-established Indian chefs in India and in Indian homes not to mention a plethora of restaurants in this country. This is nothing like anything I've had that was the real thing. This was overly sweet and bland and over-priced for the quality of food. Give me formica tables and flavour over table-cloths and over-blown ideas of the kitchen's prowess any day.I may well have been there on the chef's night off. It's the only good reason for my experience being so different from all the other good people's on this page. But I won't be going back to find out.Good luck with your meals!

    "text": "The last time I found myself in Stoke Newington, I moaned at my friend that I wanted to dine somewhere different. Somewhere unique. Somewhere which wasn't bloody Nandos. So, to stop me moaning, he took me to Rasa - the self proclaimed best Indian in Stoke Newington (if not the world). Just on decor alone, Rasa isn't your average everyday suburban Indian. Housed in a building the colour of Pepto Bismol, it serves authentic Karalan fare - a spicy and very dry type of Indian food. There are two Rasa's in Stoke Newington situated on both sides of Church Street. One serves vegetarian food and one serves meat, so do be sure that you've chosen the right one before you head in to dine. From the very first bite of the remarkably tasty deep fried snacks we were served up as an appetizer, I knew I was in heaven. Everything I ate - from my starter of Masala Dosa (a spicy mince filled pancake with potatoes) to the lemon rice which came with my main course of a chicken and chilli dish - was cooked to perfection and lip smackingly delicious. Indeed, I would have licked the plate clean if I wasn't in polite company. All of the staff who served us were incredibly friendly too, and more than happy to help us decide which dishes would make our very greedy stomachs happy. The only dish which didn't hit the spot was a strange gelatinous banana dish which was served swimming in coconut cream. It was too sweet and too strange for our Western palettes, but it would probably be just the thing for any banana lover with a particularly sweet tooth. By the end of the meal, I was very full and very content. Whilst I'm not entirely sure that Rasa is the best Indian in London, it's almost certainly the best I've tried on my travels around the capital so far.",

    "text": "Despite trying ever so hard, literally twice, to get a walk-in table at the big sister veggie restaurant of this place I still haven't managed it. On the last try, at 7.30 on a Saturday night (was definitely hedging my bets turning up then), I failed once more and once more ended up in the quite wonderful Travancore branch across the street. Which can be quite easily distinguished from the other by the presence of meat, glorious meat. During a lengthy pre-dinner discussion about dinner in general, curry in particular, my partner-in-crime had boldly claimed that fish was no good in curry - spicy goodness all too often masking the delicate flavours and not working with the textures of the fishy. So in an attempt to put that sort of chat to bed, we ordered both the fish curries from the menu with a decent amount of spiced lemon rice and some chappattis, and settled down with a bowl of snacks and chutneys instead of starters. The snack basket, what I believe are tiffin (ain't nothing like the tiffin cake I'm used to), was rather yummy. Lots of crispy stuff, banana slices, spicy pappadoms, that kind of thing. We had a tray of exciting chutneys and pickles to go with, too - I was particularly fond of the raw garlic one, though could have done with more than the thimbleful I got. Yet to work out whether the partner felt the same however. They also had a decent lemon pickle - far more palatable than most lime pickles, which I consistently try everywhere I go just in case I am going to start liking it some day, just like I did with avocado. It seems not. I did feel that by the end of startertime I'd overdosed on dried crunchy fried stuff and was more than ready for some curry action. We had a big big dish of tilapia and a smaller dish of king fish. They both disappeared very quickly - the creamy and coconutty tilapia was still light and wonderfully spicy, the meaty king fish easily smacked down our earlier wonderings about fish curry holding its own with some crazy tamarind and lots of chilli. Yummerish. The rice was great too - lemony, spicy, lentilly goodness. I so wish I could cook rice like the curry houses can but I have a sneaky suspicion it might be something to do with the devil's ghee. So yes. Rasa Travancore is an excellent place. It's being held off the full five stars for the moment - I will always feel like I'm missing something until I go for dinner at the original Rasa. Perhaps I'll amend it after I work my way in...",

We squeezed in before the 10:45pm closing time, but we were still seated and told to order quickly as the kitchen was about to close and that the restaurant closed at 11pm...fair enough. There are few vegetarian restaurants open late in this town on a weeknight and the hard-working staff understandably needs to go home at a decent hour. The service was very polite and the food came out super-quick. The bright pink decor was eye-catching from the outside and the unique folk art on the walls provided a nice touch. There was a nice warmth to the ambience on a cold night. We ordered the vegan Kerala specialities since we hadn't had Indian food from Kerala before. We had the Banana Boli to start, which were plantain fritters that were savory and sweet at the same time. The peanut and ginger sauce picked up the tastebuds onto something special...so good. The Nair Dosa was very nice, with bits of chopped beetroot and ginger in addition to the usual potato filling. It was so big that we two could only eat half. The meal was rounded out with Cheera Parippu Curry, a mild creamy curry with spinach and lentils in a thick daal, rice, and Appam, a bowl-shaped rice crepe that was slightly sweet and satisfying for any dessert cravings. I couldn't believe how reasonable the prices were for the gourmet-quality food! Most dishes were less than \u00a35, except our giant dosas which was was \u00a36.75. The entire dinner with tea was about \u00a323, such a bargain and leftovers to boot! We'll definitely be back. FYI, parking can be a challenge even at 10:30pm at night, so you can try the residential side street (Lancell Street) to the east, where we had luck.",

Given it was a mates birthday and that mate happened to not eat meat, we found ourselves on the veggie side of the street. New territory for me then.The restaurant is quite small and like most curry joints, feel a little rammed but we jumped in on a big old table at the back. Drink options seemed a little limited, no cider which is a little disappointing but some solid wine options and beer. Given we actually had no experience of ordering curry without meat, our friend ordered an array of starters and mains to all come out at once. A little wait, probably for the amount of food for 12 people, and the food covered the table, there was a ton! Loads of different options, with the majority including cauliflower and lentils, both great. A highlight was this black bean and lentil spicy mix, went amazing with the deep fried plantains. After the food, it took ages to get the table cleared, the staff seemed to forget about us a little. Little annoying as we were all parched and needed another drink or at least some water. Not a bad spot and worth a try but if I was going back I'd be found across the street topping up my protein. Be nice if it was BYOB too...!",

Snacks of popadoms, banana chips and some crunchy bites came followed by fritters and some great chutneys to accompany (sour, sweet, coconut and tangy). A mix of veg curries and tamarind rice with cashews, then an aubergine dish with a creamy sauce, a more tangy 'dry' mix veg curry, dahl and some yoghurt with soft sweet mango slices which went really well together. The paratha bread was the best I've had and made of coiled strands that pulled apart into soft threads. Perfect for scooping up the delicious mixture.We were full and satisfied at the end.

    "text": "I've been hearing about Rasa for a long time:Had a few dishes that I'd never heard of before. Namely.Kathrikka - Tasty battered aubergine. I do like aubergine so could see myself getting this again.Medhu Vadai - I found these dumplings rather flavourless. They seemed completely reliant on the coconut chutney to have any flavour, which I found a little disappointing. Not awful, just not interesting.Masala Dosa - Ah the dosa, whats not to love? Pancake, potatoe and spices! Will probably order some kind of dosa anytime I eat at one of these restaurants and this was a good one!Bagar Baingin - An unusual curry. Its an aubergine recipe with onions, corriander, chillies, tamarind, yoghurt and cashew nuts all in the mix. It was tasty, but odd. I liked it, would order it again but would probably try some other new things before going back to it.The mains were accompanied by some very nice lemon rice and a Paratha! Right now having only recently discovered this kind of Indian food, every meal at such places is like an adventure. I guess I'll get used to the genre eventually!Place filled up very soon after we sat down, with a large group occupying most of the rest of the back room that we were in. Could get a little crowded in such a case.",

    "text": "I really don't like being the 'odd review person' but unfortunately I did not enjoy the food at Rasa.I've ordered crab, beetroot curry, idli (the rice pancake) and Kesari.Crab: wasn't fresh: the meat wouldn't separate from the shell and I basically ended up having tiny bits shells being mixed up with my food because it would get tangled up with the meat. Ruined crab. And - it's not a whole crab! Just one side of it - without the delicious body!Beetroot curry: sour. Very sour. I had to send it back. Waiter substituted it with some coconut pea and carrot curry. But I would eat coconut with anything anyway - I actually believe if you add coconut milk to anything it can save majority of the foods. Well, it saved the curry. But it was lacking that something special.Idli - was ok, dry on the outside. I got used to the small putty buns in South Indian places rather than an actual crepe-looking idli.Kesari - made up for my misfortunes with the above - a contributor to a two-star review. Nice, fresh and delicious pieces of the dessert with the mango sorbet on top. If you're at Rasa \u00a0- definitely try this one.Service - very good - another contributor to the two star. Waiter advised against a green mango curry saying that it was sour and if I'm not a fan of sour I wouldn't enjoy it. He substituted the curry I didn't like and just generally was very nice.",

Dishes I have never tasted or even heard of before are lovingly described on the menu.I mean, how can you not love a place that as you sit down put some fish chutney in from of you...\"enjoy\"So I had eaten in the veggie version of this place just across the street and decided to try, now in my full carnivorous state, to sample to meaty menu. I was actually surprised, I mean the menu is not as extensive but the service was by far better and the food just as tasty! We ordered a selection, as I always like to, from the starter and mains menu and some soft drinks. It was lovely, really lovely.Now what I think swayed me a little bit more to like this place was where they say us. The venue is 3 rooms and we were on a little table in the back connecting \"walk-way\" room. This meant that my eating partner got to sit next to each other and not at opposite end of the table, which is something I love, as well as watch everyone else's yummy food pass us.... mmmmm. Perfect!",

So I'd say if you do go make sure your on a table with plenty of room and in good view of the waiters.",

This where London and not just keralites come for keralan food and that doesn't mean they tone down the spice it's exactly where my mother has it.. One criticism would be that because of the way they prepare the food bases made early and ingredients add after ordering I always come away feeling very bloated.. Doesn't take away from the taste when I am eating tho!",

    "text": "Stoke Newington favourites for many years, I was keen to try one of the outposts of South Indian restaurant Rasa. Specialising in Keralaite cuisine and particularly that from the southern part of the region, it's traditionally vegetarian or fish based, steeped in coconut, rich spices and fruit flavours and served with plain rice or flaky, butter filled parathas. The two restaurants face each other across Stoke Newington Church Street; Rasa on one side, the more established and entirely vegetarian original and the mixed and more meaty Rasa Travancore on the other. I don't mind a vegetarian restaurant, indeed, some of my favourite restaurants are vegetarian, but given the choice, and seeing the reception that the veggie end of the Travancore menu got from my more health aware guest, we went for the meaty side of the street. Once inside the garish pink portal, you're not transported to a open air joint on the humid Kerala coast, more a generic curry house on a suburban high street. The thick faux leather menu that clumps down does its best to get you there though. First there's the pricing, and that pleasant holiday sense of surprised \"how much!\". Then there's the list of food, rich in interesting difference, a world of exotic Malabar, Keralian and Travancore rarities poetically arranged in Ariel Bold. A starter of lamb puffs were slightly irrelevant. Homemade sausage rolls in perfectly fine pastry cocoons, the mince richly and appropriately spiced, but nothing that would be cause for more than a murmur appearing in a home packed picnic on nearby Clissold Park.The meat free Travancore Kayi Curry was, considering the restaurant's vegetarian roots and the fact it was labelled as \u00a0signature dish, surprisingly pedestrian. Potatoes, peas and carrots in a thin mild coconut curry sauce. A student staple, though at \u00a33.90 for a big bowl, student pricing too.Tharavu Roast Duck was a different beast altogether. A thick, technically dry curry, brought to life with a hefty whallop of black pepper, cardamom and ginger. The richness of the meat, braised and shredded, contrasted with the deep and complex sauce. Suggested with the aforementioned doughily delicious parathas, it was the sort of cooking you'd come back for again and again. I wouldn't necessarily say the same for the veggie main, but maybe that's what you cross the street for.",

    "text": "Rasa has a few restaurants around London, some are Veggie, some are meat and some are fish. \u00a0The original 2 are on Church street (opposite sides of the road to each other - both Pink, can't miss them really) and are veggie & meat. It's South Indian /Keralan food at it's best! This is the guy who taught Jamie Oliver how to cook Indian. Rasa also sells his own cook books in his restaurants, I love them, the recipes are really easy to follow and use really fresh ingredients.The few dishes on the menu are so nice and different from the usual English/Indian places (the ones with the dodgy carpets, 20 different types of the same curry and mildly annoying waiters that stand and stare at you whilst you eat because you are the only one in their place, yes, you know the ones! )The popodoms and dips are great, all different shapes and unusual flavoured dips.If you get the chance, I definitely recommend you try one of his restaurants.",
