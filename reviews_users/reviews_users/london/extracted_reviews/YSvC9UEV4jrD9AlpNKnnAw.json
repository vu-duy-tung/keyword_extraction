I can see why its popular but I can't really feel it. My pasta dish was just a pasta dish - hardly worth remembering. Service is inconsistent. A place that looks good on your CV.",

    "text": "I want to live above The Eagle, or in it. Basically if I lived in close proximity to this place I would never leave. I would eat myself into a gluttonous early grave, and bankrupt myself, but it would be so worth it. Lucky you Farringdon people for having such a lovely gastro pub in your midst. Why do I like this place so much? I love the old fashioned feel of it. I love the battered sofas. I even love the battered wobbly chairs (maybe fix a couple of them please). I love the fact that not one plate matches. To be fair, there are plenty of pubs in London that work the rough around the edges chic, but this place does not seem contrived in the slightest. And then there is the food. If you ever worry when you go into a pub that the food may have been pre cooked you won't have that concern because the kitchen stove makes up one end of the bar, so you can watch steaks and fish being slapped on over hot pans, and pots bubbling over the stove.The menu is quite small, its on a chalk board above the cooking end of the bar. I broke my 14 year vegetarian streak here by ordering the most succulent sausages on a bed of puy lentils and salsa verde. This dish was about 10 or 11 quid. Perfectly acceptable for this standard of cooking. If you order the fish you get one whole fish; these are not small portions. Other dishes include an immensely popular steak sandwich, and a couple of smaller tapas dishes. The dishes seem to have a slightly Portuguese twist to them; look out for the little Portuguese custard tarts which you can get as a pudding, but they seem to disappear pretty early on in the evening.One small warning; you can't book tables for small parties. So either get here early or be prepared to share someone else's table. What they keep pretty quiet is that you can book for larger parties then 6 people, so this is what I did for my last birthday.",

It seemed like the perfect place to go to get rid of our hangovers after a party around the corner the night before. Every other time I've tried to come here it's been packed so we couldn't get a seat. It's worth mentioning that although it's got a pub feel, you won't feel right if you want to stand around and have a drink - this is sitting down lazy eating at its best. It's not somewhere you pop in for a swift half. The placed is layed out like a gorgeous open plan living room. If it had some old leather sofas people may never leave! The staff were a clearly new, but service was fast enough if a little disjointed. I got myself a brilliant virgin Mary. It's not my usual drink of choice but I felt like I needed some vitamins back in me! Every single decent bloody Mary i've had has been in Farringdon area and this was no exception. Lunch was partridge (yes, posh i know, but I've never had it before) and a kind of potato gratin with anchovies and cream. it was a tad too salty for me, but it was really well cooked. I'm not sure I'd choose the same again. I think that's my problem with this place. While i love being ale to stand at the bar and see my food cooking (the kitchen is part of the bar), understandably, the menu isn't very long. If there isn't anything you fancy then you might lose out. Choosing between about 7 dishes that come with a ready specified side does seem a little limiting. But i can't fault the place, and I want to come back and try more of the food. maybe then it'll get my last star.",

Despite being titled as a gastropub I never find their prices exorbitant with a focus on just great value and great tasting foods. I'd recommend arriving early in this popular venue as they don't take bookings and there really isn't that much space inside to house a large group of people. They do ask that people only occupy tables that are in your group so that others have a chance of sitting down. Specials get written up, in old-fashioned chalkboard style and seem to rotate fairly regularly. I can't say that I've ever had a meal that didn't go down well at this wonderful gastro pub.",

Picking our meal from the chalkboard menu I chose the braised free range chicken leg, Cyprus potatoes with garlic, anchovy and rosemary chili. My wife and our friend both chose the Eagle Steak sandwich. I can report the chicken was tender and flavorful, with just enough chili to give it some heat and augment the flavor of the chicken and potatoes.The Eagle Steak sandwich was marvelous. The steak was tender to the tooth, with roasted onion, in a spicy sauce, topped with romaine lettuce, all in a brioche bun. No other sauce or condiment is needed with this sandwich. Both dishes were perfect portions, and paired well with the drawn Guinness.We topped off the meal with a wonderful Walnut truffle chocolate cake. Rich dark chocolate without any bitterness, with walnut chunks infused throughout. A very memorable meal for our last night in London!",

Here you'll find New British dishes infused with a bit of Mediterranean flair - like potato soup with chorizo, tapas plates of multi-coloured olives, or a perfectly cooked hanger steak accompanied by grainy mustard.I arrived before my dining companion and snagged the travel section of the paper from a big stack at the back and settled in at a communal table near the window. I was soon accompanied by another woman who was eating and drinking solo. This gastropub's equally good for solo and group dining, depending on which you fancy. Half empty when I arrived at half past six on Saturday night, The Eagle was brimming with boisterous patrons an hour later.While most folks were on beer, I quite enjoyed my two glasses of Rioja.

Top it off with some Leffe on Tap (and a Pint of bitter for the bf), and open plan kitchen and a great little menu that sounded great - we thought we had found the real deal, the birthplace of the gastopub.I ordered steak toast and the bf a pasta dish. So far so good, looking at the chefs milling about behind the partition and things cooking, we were generally very excited.Then the food came, and unfortunately this is where it all unravelled. The waitress slapped the plates down and had turned around before I even got a chance to smile at her. The food looked promising, large plates and nice looking meat.I then realised my steak toast had no butter or any other sauce, it was only a piece of toast and a steak. I waved over a different waiter and asked for some ketchup or mayonnaise, or any steak sauce really - at which point the waiter looked at me like something he found under his shoe and said 'We dont serve condiments.' No sorry, no unfortunately, no 'um, i could get you some olive oil?', no nothing.So I understand completely the desire not to slap heinz or hellmans onto a nice steak but PLEASE, give me some homemade mayonnaise or freshly made tomato ketchup, or even just a bit of butter - anything!! And please, when I ask a completely acceptable question in a friendly way, and its your job to answer - reciprocate in kind!We were a bit speechless after that, the mood definitely taken down a notch. The food itself was alright, the steak cooked well enough and the pasta good, but a little forgettable. Nothing to really write home and nothing I would brave the service or 'rules' for to come back for.So boo to you, Eagle. I love steak, I love toast - and I SO wanted to love you!",

Expect hearty, delicious, well-made food that will warm you up and put a smile on your face. This is now one of my hang-outs when I come to town and though the Guardian isn't in the 'hood' anymore; I'll still go out of my way for a friendly pint and a hearty dinner.

    "text": "Sometimes clearly defining what makes a gastropub stand out from your bog standard pub is a challenge, but much like defining what porn is - you just know it when you see it. And this my friends, is the porn version of a pub.A tall divider separates the dining area from the bar, and although I was there during the frenzy of an England football match during the holiest of holy World Cup, I still watched the posh delve into everything from lamb liver and mussels to grilled sardines and iman biyeldi, while the common-folk like myself simply got sloshed on Spanish reds and pints of real ale at the bar. (Hey, football brings us all together right?) I soon realised that we were all drooling not only over the h.u.g.e. sport-filled screen pulled down from the ceiling, but over the food on the other side of the wall as well, so made it a priority to get back and sample a bite of the posh life for myself. While it didn't knock my socks off, I must pay homage to the hallowed and humble beginnings of British porn. I mean gastropubs.",

    "text": "Why are there not more pubs like The Eagle? It makes the combination of great food in a great bar look so easy and yet my many experiences of pub dining have proved to me that it is not. Last night was my first visit to this wonderful place and really, I couldn't fault it for a thing. When we arrived inside The Eagle we were immediately met with a wall of sounds and smells. In addition to the noise of chattering punters there were plenty of crashes and bangs to contend with coming from the open kitchen. It's this feature which is also responsible for filling the room with such delicious smells. Having tossed a coin with a man also queuing for a table I couldn't help the building feeling of anticipation stemming from this pubs' brilliant atmosphere. The food did not disappoint at all. All day I've found myself fantasising about another portion of my Pork Belly with Lentils and Salsa Verde. How did they make the crackling so good? My brothers Crab Linguine was also delicious and very reminiscent of meals we'd enjoyed in Italy. In addition to this, the wine list at The Eagle is really impressive and although it's not huge, all the wines we tried were top notch. Simply put, The Eagle is a great night out where the relaxed atmosphere has not been allowed to undermine quality cooking. Five stars all round!",

    "text": "If there is a glimmer of hope, happiness and joy in London on a dreary, rainy Saturday afternoon, it lives here. We were lucky enough to grab two seats by the window because when we walked in it was packed with people who seemed as though they had been there for hours and would stay for several more. I can't say I blame them.I was first lured into this place because I heard they served made kick-ass bloody mary's (strangely, a rarity in London) and this was was confirmed instantly after all the ingredients spice and care that went into mixing this cocktail, and then most importantly, by the first sip. For around 5 pounds it's advisable to order at least 2 while you're there.After intensely watching the cooks in the kitchen and drooling over everything that was made and served from the fresh chalkboard menu, we were compelled to order something, anything. Since it was in the middle of the afternoon and between meals we went for simple olives and marinated boquerones and some light red wine, which was, divine indeed. Yet the highlight of our experience was when one of the cooks passed over a small sample of the haddock and sage risotto he'd seen me drool over and say 'damn that looks tasty' every time he prepared a dish. It was a lovely gesture and I think I licked the plate. I recommend coming here hungry and ordering this straight away. Better yet, come with a friend and split this and a steak sandwich...and all the appetizers if you can swing it. You won't be disappointed.Rustic, comfortable, homey atmosphere, amazing food and drink. Overall, enchanting. Why can't I live here? PS - it's insanely crowded for a reason, probably smart to stop by during off-peak hours (but before they close the kitchen down before dinner service) and be patient. Because everything good comes to those who wait. Just like me, waiting 6 months until finding this place although it's been here forever as London's 1st official gastro. Finally my fav spots in SF have some competition. It's about time!",

So much so the staff knows me and my boyfriend and always wonders where we are if they don't see us at least once a week !!! eeekkk i know, but whats funny is i know how to cook !! I began coming to this pub 3 odd years ago and was just blown away at the eclectic menu, which takes traditional continental dishes and gives them a twist !The tapas are always that little bit quirky, from smoked pigeon to good old smoked salmon, \u00a0but all of the greatest quality and quantity !!! Its great to get a few to share if you're having drinks. But what this place is good at its amazing main courses, they have a relatively wide array of dishes, but the trick is to come early as the popular one run out. They carry lovely steaks and also do the french cut \"onglet\" which you don't find in many places ! They always have at least one fish dish if not two and the accompanying sides can be dishes on their own, they are so good !! A couple of vegetarian dishes \u00a0are always available and they d a lovely twist to the bruschetta!!! The dessert usually consists of the Portuguese egg tarts and cheese and fruit !!A Little bit of advise, chat with the waiters and cooks, they are amazing, and will tell you which is the best dish. I usually just ask them what to order !!Also it does get busy on weeks days and, and is tough to find seats so come early if you want a leisurely meal, On the weekend the lucnh is lovely and relaxed and you can enjoy a chat with the chefs or sit and enjoy the newspapers !",

The older gentleman working was very rude about us doing that, the place wasn't even packed and we'd made note to arrive before the lunch rush to avoid any delays as we only have an hour. Not sure what the fuss was about, unnecessary rudeness. On the other hand, the food was delicious. Would high recommend the steak sandwich (monster stack of meat).

Sitting at a corner of a busy street, this pub-restaurant looks cosy without overdoing it. Actually it looked a little off to me first time I stepped inside. Lights were not too bright and it gave a grayish look with the rain outside. It was like stepping in a place you read about in books. Once the vision had disappeared I realized how heart warming this place is. It is busy in there mainly because of having the kitchen in the open, in the main room. You pick a chair, and then everything has to be ordered from the counter. And that is where it starts. Menus are written on chalk boards and change every day, even every hours. It is simple and food combinations looked all very appealing the day we were there. I got the steak, not so original you should say. But oh god I don't regret it. Perfectly cooked, thinly cut, lightly browned on the outside, veggies grilled next to it. Friends took the fish, a wholly grilled fish with delish Swiss chard. It was perfect. Plates looked and tasted great. Service is impeccable. While you eat, locals poured in, staff worked hard in the open kitchen, allowing you to see everything. To me it is a fast-casual-trendy (without willing to be) restaurant. Very nice time there. To end this beautiful moment we got the lemon panacota with caramel and caramelized onion and boy this one topped it all. Very very nice desert. Clap clap clap. We finished it all and gave a warm au revoir to the host. We'll be back for sure. This was worth the trip.",

The cooking area is behind the bar so you can see how freshly cooked your food is! All the chairs, tables and crockery are mis matches which only adds to the charm of the place. You have to go if you're anywhere near Farringdon!",

    "text": "What more to say about the Eagle? You go expecting delicious food, because of the reputation. And indeed it's held to that reputation.... had a piri piri quail with a farro salad which was inventive and tasty. Doesn't break the bank either at 10.80. The beer selection is a little uninspired, being the same standard draughts you see elsewhere. It's a little chaotic, as many come just to drink as well as nibble, and it's quite a small place. This is definitely the type of place I'd bring someone to visit, if not just for the \"gastropub\" charm.",

    "text": "I've walked by this dozens of times, but never really put it together that it was the famous gastropub until I was looking for a pub/restaurant close to Farringdon tube station. I met two friends here on a weekday evening, and to my surprise, it had much more of a pub atmosphere than that of a gastropub, with lots of people sitting in large groups at the table and just drinking (well, it was also Christmas time). By way of contrast, The Jugged Hare and Bull & Last had much more of a quiet restaurant setting, and Anchor and Hope has a separate dining room set out from the main bar. They also don't take reservations for tables, so we let a server know that we were waiting and then grabbed drinks at the bar. I ordered a Hackney IPA to start and it was a little warm for my liking (i.e. not cold at all). After about 20-30 minutes, three seats opened up by the window, as in stools along the ledge looking out to the street. We thought it was actually nice to be a little separated from the loud pub rowdiness going on in the centre, so it worked out quite well. Then it took us a while to realise that there was no menu coming, as the menu is on the blackboard behind the bar/open kitchen and you have to get up and order at the bar. Unfortunately they had ran out of sea bream by that point so I went with the chef's recommendation, the crab linguini, and my two friends ordered The Eagle Burger, filled with at least 4 thin slices of steak. I thought the crab linguini was ok, very fishy but tasty, but I probably won't try to order a pasta at a pub again. My friends liked the burger, though there was no indication that it was spicy and it actually has quite a strong kick to it. There were no sides served with it, but it was already too much to finish. There's not much in terms of service, as the server only brings the food out to you, and drinks are self-serve at the bar and they are not exactly bringing water to the table. That said, you are not paying for it either. Overall I think it is a fun place but it definitely feels like food takes a backseat.",

They also have this awesome rock shandy which would score high on my alternative 5 star review system (based on quality of soft drink provision).What I didn't like was that the food took AGES to come. We got there pretty late so I was really hungry. Maybe it was all the acid in my stomach but the gorgonzola risotto I had didn't go down so well either. One of my friends had a sausage disk that was absolutely incredible though. I had major food envy. I don't know why I'm always compelled to order risotto in restaurants because I'm always a bit disappointed (like here, it didn't really taste much of gorgonzola which was what attracted me to it in the first place).",

It is overwhelmingly simple, with a mix of tables and chairs and half of the bar being an open kitchen which pumps our really delicious, if unimpressive looking food. Don't expect parsley and swirls of a fancy reduction on the side of your dish. Do expect a handful of great beers on tap, and 5 or 6 main rotating food options which always include the massive and mouthwatering steak sandwich.Perfect spot for a bunch of drinks with friends and some good food mixed in!",

It gets crowded and you just kind of seat yourself- I think it depends on where you sit, but I didn't feel too comfortable where I was seated.Service: You order up at the bar and they'll bring you out your food. I was a little confused with this concept and since it was a bit loud and crowded, it was hard to get the attention of the people behind the bar. The chefs will answer your questions on food if you have any though, so that's nice.Food: I like that they change their menu up frequently and the food is quite good! I had the filet strip steak and it was cooked all nice and juicy. I did have to chew my way through just a little but it wasn't bad by any means. My friends also throughly enjoyed their dishes and finished them all up.Overall: The vibe isn't really my scene, but the food is really better than average here, so pop in for a yummy meal!",
