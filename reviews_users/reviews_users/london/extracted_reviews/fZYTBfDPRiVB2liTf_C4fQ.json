This is why Cafe Sol is a winner - this mexican restaurant clears away the tables at 11, turns up the volume, and welcomes Claphamites (for free i might add) for a night of fun, cheesy dancing sans sticky floor! The food is standard tex-mex but good. And the cocktails taste mighty fine too!",

The cocktails are definately a must, this is a good resturant for large groups as they never seem to struggle with the numbers and we have never had problems with orders. Try not to have to many tequilas though !! My favourite dish is the mixed fajitas or the chimichanga",

A bit noisy and the servers seemed a bit confused as to what table dishes were to be going to as multiple servers were working with multiple tables at the same time. But all in all a good place. \u00a0I've been twice now and plan to go back. \u00a03 stars thus far, and we'll see if further visits improve my vote!",

    "text": "I've lived in Clapham for years now and this restaurant is one of my staple favourites that I come back to time and again. To me, Mexican food is all basically the same ingredients, just folded differently. So I find it hard to go wrong with any of the menu choices. If you want sheer wow factor then get the fajitas as they come out sizzling all over the place. Everyone will stare like it's the first time they've ever seen such an event. Get out more people! The service is good, the food is above average, portion sizes are big and you'll leave full and dreaming of cheese and nachos. The marghirita's are dangerously easy to drink...a jug will set you back \u00a318 but it's good for a group of 3/4. I'm not an expert so I can't judge whether they are strong or not, but I've had a pretty bad hangover from them so I'm guessing they are potent enough. The atmosphere is always lively, there's usually a couple of big groups or birthdays in there - and because it's open really late it's a good option for that meal that just keeps on going.",

Don't expect anything more than that!In the evening up until around 10pm it is a Mexican restaurant. I have to say the food isn't the best but it is fairly cheap and everyone is up for a fun night who comes here. The tables are then cleared to make way for a dance floor and that is where you will usually stay until closing. I did notice though, after going 2 weeks in a row that the music was identical to the previous week and in the same order - most people would be too drunk to notice - yes, it does attract lots of groups of the same sex, strutting their stuff to impress the groups of the opposite sex. You know the drill!The bar is fun though and definitely good for a fun and cheap night out. The White Russian cocktails are also very pleasant.",

On the plus side, if you could call it a plus side, the menu wasn't just Mexican, it had all the regular burgers/ribs/stuff on the menu that more picky eaters will indulge in like I once did.

    "text": "The restaurant is run by Italians and the menu has both burgers and ribs on it, if that tells you anything about the kind of establishment this is. \u00a0I mean, burgers and ribs? \u00a0Really? \u00a0I overheard someone at the table next to me say, 'I don't know if I should order a burger or a chimichanga...' \u00a0Um, I know what you should order at a Mexican restaurant. \u00a0And I'll give you a hint: it's not a burger.The restaurant itself was fun and inviting and got me in the mood to eat some delicious food. \u00a0The margarita I ordered was strong and delicious, served appropriately with just tequila, triple sec and lime juice in a low-ball glass over ice with a salted rim; however, the cost of this pleasure was a steep (and a bit shocking) \u00a35.95.We got some tortilla chips and guacamole for the table. \u00a0The tortilla chips were thin and crispy (excited face), but they were WAY over-salted. \u00a0Still good, though. \u00a0The \u00a31.85 side of guacamole was served in a teeny tiny sauce ramekin (really, terribly sad and weeping face), although it was pretty good (but I don't know how I really feel about the addition of raw onion. At least it wasn't red. \u00a0Yeah, I'm looking at YOU Wahaca!). After looking over the menu, I realised the only 'Mexican' food from which I could choose was a chimichanga or an enchilada. \u00a0Although, the chimichanga wasn't really an option for me, as the menu did not advertise its vegetarian option. \u00a0I ordered the spicy vegetable enchiladas. \u00a0They arrived on a plate that looked good, but as soon as I put my fork into them, they disintegrated into nothingness. \u00a0And they were REALLY F*CKING SPICY.I mean, I like spicy things, but that's all these enchiladas were. \u00a0Spicy. \u00a0The only thing I could taste was spicy. \u00a0What kind of vegetables were in it? I have no idea, as the filling looked and tasted like unidentifiable mushy matter of spicy spiceness from Spicytown (with some corn kernels, because we all know that corn kernels can withstand everything). \u00a0I suppose I should quantify this; it wasn't the spiciest thing I've tasted in my life, nor was it so spicy that I had to drink water while eating it. \u00a0No, it wasn't that spicy. \u00a0What I mean to suggest is that 'spicy' was all this enchilada had going for it. \u00a0The spice overpowered any other flavours that may have been going on in there. \u00a0And that's just not pleasant. \u00a0I love Mexican food because of the simple ingredients and clean, feel-good flavours (yes, with a bit of spice in there too), but there was very little to like and enjoy about those enchiladas, because I couldn't taste anything other than chilli.The accompanying pinto beans were average (and, sadly, not refried), as was the plain white boiled rice, although the melted cheese on top of these items made them the highlight of my meal.Overall, disappointing. \u00a0But such is what we have to work with in London, I suppose. \u00a0So, two stars. \u00a0Yes, I have experienced better. \u00a0I'd rather go to Cafe Pacifico.(If they'd served me that guacamole in a big ol' bowl, I might've given them three stars.)",

I've never had alligator in Los Angeles or Mexico. Nor have I seen sangria at any other Mexican restaurant. Well they have both, along with chimichangas (vegetarian as well). They also have an extensive drink menu. This is not Mexican street food. It is fusion of styles and dishes from Mexico and it works really well.Right when we walked in the door we were greeted and taken to our table. The place smelled wonderful. The open kitchen allowed the aroma of bell peppers, sauces and roasting meet float through the dining area. The wait staff was superb. Cafe Sol is busy but not crowded. We never felt rushed. The staff was great and the food was well worth it. The whole package came together very well. It's a good place to take a date or a group of friends.As a foodie an Angelino and a lover of Mexican cuisine, I recommend Cafe Sol.",

If you aren't a regular, you could easily miss it on the high street since there is so much going on in the evening. And it doesn't look as flashy as the other establishments nearby - but let's clarify that this is a good thing!I have spent so many Friday and Saturday nights there that I should receive honorary membership of some sort or at least half price offer on their amazing cocktails. You can go there during the evening for a quiet meal (by the way, it's the best Mexican in London I have tried so far) or wait till around 11pm when the staff moves all the tables to the side to create a dance floor for a bit of boogie. And between you and me, it's the best place to be! No entry fees, no stuck-up attitude and no sleaziness. I just love that place! It's fun, vibrant and easy on your pocket.",

If you're in Clapham or the surrounding areas this place is brilliant for proper Mexican food! It's not cheesy and over entertaining. It's good simple Mexican good done brilliantly!I popped in here for my monthly catch up with a ground of old mates and we were all really happy. The service was good, staff were quite attentive, but it was busy so I understand why they were running around. We didn't have starters this time although when we have in the past, the nachos are good and also the potatoes skins are special! I had a burrito with chicken, black beans and rice. It was brilliant! The only reason this place doesn't get a five out of five was because the service was good but not exceptional. Aside from that, a good night out, good food and a good catch up. Definitely worth a visit!",

It was good enough, in fact, for me to come back when I have that all-too-familiar Mexican craving.Decent and nicely warm tortilla chips (though you have to pay for them), with actual fresh tomato salsa (a rare thing here). You could tell they added too much sugar, however, to make up for a lack of ripe tomatoes in the winter, but what can you do?I had fajitas (mix of chicken and steak), and they were nice! Served with various toppings and warm flour tortillas.Rob H.and I had just come from having a few drinks at the YEE at The Loft across the street, so I am wary of alcohol-induced yum bias here. BUT I had my leftover fajitas for dinner the next night and they were equally tasty, so I'd say I was not that influenced by the lemongrass cocktails consumed earlier in the evening.Not far from Clapham North Tube Station, so I'll certainly be back when that time of the month hits! (No... my monthly Mexican craving. Don't be gross, please).",

The chairs and tables are all stacked away and the main space becomes a dancefloor and it's pretty popular. On a Friday night it's free to get in and on a Saturday it's only about \u00a33. The staff are really friendly (until you take your shoes off they don't appreciate this) and it's a nice crowd. My only gripe is that if you buy spirits, they come as a double as standard. And so if you ask just for a single, you still will get charged for a double, which is a little bit naughty. But overall, a fun night. And being right on the high street, if you want to move on, there's plenty of options around.",

    "text": "On our way to Revolution to watch the game last week, some friends and I were suddenly struck by a craving for Mexican cuisine. It's not as widely available here as it is at home so Cafe Sol was a welcome, delicious little haven. Prompt service and great food. I had the shrimp taco salad (sans the fried tortilla bowl) which was packed with not only a healthful number of jumbo prawns, but a dose of baby shrimp as well. The salad wasn't overly dressed or loaded with cheese, so I felt relatively heathy. My flat mates got an assortment of enchiladas and burritos, all of which looked scrumptious. As did the guac and salsa.The price wasn't awful, in fact I felt it to be relatively reasonable for quality Mexican food. My friends split a pitcher of fruity sangria, which they reported was wonderful and a good value.Recommended if you're in the area, in fact we might make the trek from South Ken sometime soon!",

Love the fact that they use real cheese (not the fake nacho cheese).Steak and Chicken fajitas - Very filling. Come with all the fixins. Perfect meat/tortilla portion.Spicy chicken enchilada - Great kick to it and yummy flavors.

The dimly lit room and extensive cocktail menu caught my attention straight away and then it was the hottie of a waiter who further fueled my enthusiasm for this place. I can here as part of a group, 7 peopl in fact, and as much as I thought this place was 5 stars of Mexican imitation joy if you are coming her for a date definitely ask to sit at the front - the back is somehow colder and less intimate.So to the meal, the menu would make any Mexican blush, it's mail tex-mex but I did see some authentic looking fish dishes (no fish tacos unfortunately!) but wow did I have a meal! I ate chip with homemade didp and a pile of perfectly cooked meat. I sunk my teeth into a rack of ribs, chicken bits and a deep fried wrap thingy which was surprising light. The cocktails were brilliant but quite pricey and the best thing on the drinks menu is the Sangria, homemade and like nothing I have tasted before. It's their secret recipe.I really liked this place, great food, good staff, nice atmosphere, great value. Apparently it turns into a late night bar when all the eating has finished and the Salsa dancing commences. I was a little to hungover to stay for this but I have been informed its a fantastic night out.",
