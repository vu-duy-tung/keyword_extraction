That was disappointing. I got the fish and chips and it was just sort of average. \u00a0We had an 8 year old with us, though, and there was NOTHING that would have appealed to children. \u00a0It is pretty sad that there was no children's menu. \u00a0All fancy sort of junk at high prices.Aside from the average food (and why I gave 2 stars instead of 3), the biggest problem was that we had called earlier in the day and asked about a quiz night. \u00a0They said it started at 8:30, but it didn't actually start until 10:15!! Can' you believe it?? \u00a0The quiz master guy (who seemed quite drunk the whole time) said he had to wait for people to finish eating before the quiz started. \u00a0WHAT? \u00a0That seems a bit absurd and was very inconvenient. \u00a0Very late to start a quiz on a Sunday night. The staff who we called earlier should have been more honest about the actual start time. \u00a0Will absolutely not go back unless it is just for drinks outside.",

It's quite a small pub, but there's enough room to pull up a seat and have a drink. I've been to a few parties and work dos here too. They also do food, and there are tables on two levels. If you're passing on a summer's day and have a thirst, it's nice to take your drink down to the towpath and sit on the seats overlooking the water. I have fond memories of sitting down there one balmy summer's evening with a pint from the Narrowboat and watching a fantastic moonrise in a lilac sky over the water. bliss.",

People actually seems to sit out there no matter what the weather is like. Unfortunately their food is quite boring and a little expensive too. I had a risotto with no flavour at all. Not even salt. And my partner had a strange sandwich - and not strange in any good way. Their coffee (latte) was not very good either - it was more like warm milk with a little coffee taste. So stick with the alcohol and it is a great place.",

We enjoyed our beer overlooking the canal on one of the small terraces and as soon as it was too cold to stand, we moved inside to thaw-out in front of the rawing open fire. They serve food, though we didn't eat (this time), I'm looking forward to the next visit.",

The beef was done medium rare which is in itself rare sight to see, and melt in the mouth gorgeousness. The presentation of the dish was a bit deceiving, since I thought I only had a few same-ish greens on the side, but after devouring half the plate, I realised hidden under the great slab of meat, there was a large selection of different veggies! Absolute find! The creme brulee was citrusy which worked beautifully for an otherwise heavier end to the meal.It was a shame that the weather was dreadful, so we ended up getting a seat inside, barely at a window. Don't get me wrong, the decor is definitely stylish and it wasn't too busy either so it was the perfect location to catch up on the goss. But I'm looking forward to summer when we could sit outside the Narrow Boat and take in the view and fresh air!",

There's nothing I like more than heading here on a sunny weekend afternoon to spend a few blissful hours sitting by the canal enjoying a crisp glass of wine. It's a 10 minute walk from Angel station, but the minute you step inside you literally forget that you're in London. It's such a nice break from the loud, bustling pubs of upper street. Now, don't get me wrong this place does get busy, but due to its size, people don't tend to loiter around the bar...if there's a table people stay, if not, they tend to head elsewhere which is fantastic as it frees up space and servers for the rest of us. The service is always really good and I can't seem to fault the food. I've tried the burger, the steak and the linguine and all were fantastic. They have a great selection of beers and wines; my favorites being their Chardonnay and their Pinot Grigio. If you're heading for the Sunday roast I'd definitely suggest that you make a reservation...trust me...you don't want to be part of the \"elsewhere\" crowd.",

We were both waiting for bike repairs at Lock 7 on Broadway market (see later review) and asked one of the staff there for a recommendation. 'Try the Narrow Boat - just down the canal'. 'Just down' turned out to be a 25-minute walk which, when you're hungry and don't know quite where you're going, ain't good. But it was worth a bit of a schlepp, as the food was unexpectedly superb. Arbroath smokie pat\u00e9 with toast to start, a huge lemon sole with new potatoes (black sauce - capers/butter etc), roast lamb with new potatoes. The sole was sublime - by coincidence I'd used the same recipe for skate some weeks ago, and it's definitely a winner. Tempting to knock a star off for the sticky tables - the varnish is corrupting, degrading or some such and they've not put cloths over them. But I'm in a generous mood, so I'll let it slide. I'd definitely recommend this place for a Sunday lunch on a summer's day. \u00a355 for two included three courses each and a glass of wine. Pretty good value, and nice service",

    "text": "Canalside is as good as it gets in Islington, unless you're in one of those mansions on Lonsdale Square, or maybe the Mayor. The Narrow Boat basically nails the non-0.01% best location for a pub in my 'hood. With a small ground floor (i.e., street level) balcony over the canal and a set of benches alongside the water, you'll find no better place for a sunny pint. Extra points for plastic go-cups to enjoy that pint along the unusually wide towpath just west of the pub. This wide area is particularly notable for the vision you get into the private lives of those folks in the fancy canalside condos. Guys, the floor-to-ceiling windows might have seemed a good idea on the tour, but maybe some tinting is called for? Either that or a major workout plan.",

    "text": "Not a lot of Londoners know about the Grand Union Canal, which flows from Angel towards East London. Along this canal lots of house boats have docked in port . This is an ideal Sunday walk to get some fresh air. But any walk should end with a glass of white wine and some food, right? The Narrow Boat has both. When the sun shines you even can sit on the terrace and have a view on the water! The restaurant is built over two floors, very narrow and looks like inside of a boat.As a tradition, Londoners eat fish on Fridays, but I make an exception. At The Narrow Boat I order fish and chips with mushy peas even on a Sunday. My friend selected the pork sausage and mashed potatoes coming with a rich sauce. After a good lunch you can read your newspaper and drink some coffee without getting asked to leave. \u00a0Leaving the restaurant you can stroll back along the canal and if you are lucky you can see the sun downing reflecting in industrial buildings - \u00a0I feel like not being in a city for a moment.",

    "text": "A very pretty place, a pretty substandard experience. Pre-booked (in advance) for a birthday dinner, our bakers dozen sat in front of pinned back bifold glass doors on a long table, the sun shined in on us and the babbling canal babbled by. Tourists did the same. Babbled on by, intrigued, peered in. Eyes gazed on diners plates and after some time, I did too, crane my neck around to spy on what other diners were eating. Our table gleefully saw what was being placed down around us and with equal expectation we eagerly anticipated our salubrious Sunday meal.When a setting for 1pm, gets you served dinner at 2:50 not with the greeting 'enjoy your meals', but a \"may we remind you that your table is reserved for someone else at four\". I can't say that this got my digestive juices flowing considering their inattentive reactions to us waving for service several times, but rather, this made my mouth dry as if it were lined with feathers and I was about to spit them out. This got my blood boiling, in fact, when the only thing that should have been boiling were the carrots. Now this is not the temperature which I want my food served, but initially, when we were given the choice of rare or well done meat, two of our party chose to opt for beef as rouge as our blushes, rare as one would be if raring to go in a little red car, rare like a little red ruby in the sand, ya get me. I want the protein pink. It arrived very very well done. I'd say well done for the rustic-ish menu and beautiful setting, but when one wants ones slab of meat bleeding it's a disappointment to say the least when it wasn't. Two of our party quite rightly mentioned this as advised in the menu, that one ought to state how one likes ones meat. They obliged and conceded to mistaken plates and returned sharpish with these replaced plates, pronto! Great. How wonderff...freezing! Absolutely freezing. Both replaced plates of food were cold. Our group tired of this service and at now at 3.15 one of our party was still without The Narrow Boat's attempt of their dinner. To put things thrice time right our manageress through gritted teeth asked us if there was anything they could do to make things nice. It'd have been nice if they'd have got things right in the first instance but this affair was as casual as a cable knit cardi. Sadly the dishes all around were pretty slap dash, a miserly pork roast of no sizeable match to the rest of the roasts was disappointing, duck salad came with a boiled egg with yolks powdery and sad as the cremated shredded duck. When we all took our turns to raise our complaints, our manageress pleasantly smoothed over the bad service and did as much as she possibly could to appease their weak game, even replacing plates, but for a leisurely not particularly busy 'busy spot', they need to raise their game at the very least. The Narrow Boat will narrowly miss my future recommendations I'm afraid.",

There is not a lot of sun here. 2. I rarely find myself drinking away an afternoon (perhaps I should change this?) Yes, I should. And so I started at The Narrow Boat -- as we just so happened upon it on our walk back from Angel. With the sun still peeping about in the later dusk-like hours, the canal nearby, people enthralled with the idea that it just *might* be summer, and the aimlessness of a Sunday, all added up to YES. My comrade and I pulled up two comfy chairs in the front and spent a good hour lounging, talking, enjoying the atmosphere (and the dogs! dog-friendly!), soaking up sun through the big paned windows, mingling a bit with the regulars. The staff was sweet (the tall blonde behind the bar, major props -- very welcoming). I'd not resist another attempt to drink a few pints here...especially when all the stars, suns, afternoon hours and blissful London spring arrives.",

This is such an idyllic spot, that the Narrow Boat wouldn't have to do much to be a very nice pub indeed. There's a lovely balcony over the canal, and the upstairs bar has large west facing windows which catch the setting sun. Luckily, they do a lot more. The service was warm and friendly, and they have a normal pub with favourites such as a fish and chips and of course burgers. My haddock butty arrived blazingly fast and was none the poorer for it. The only drawback, was that from somewhere on the canal, diesel fumes were washing over the balcony and into the pub. That ruined it for me, still I retreated inside and basked in the setting sun while enjoying my food. Hopefully, the fumes were a one-off because this is one of the nicest spots I've been to anywhere in London, so I will be back.",

There was no way in hell one could have had a sunday roast without \u00a0being hunched over the entire time, sretching to get to the table. When i asked politely if we could have a table that we could actually eat off, I got a mindless, blank look i've only ever seen in Zombie movies. 'Oh...we gave you that table because we thought you guys would want room.' Very kind of you, I said, injecting a british 'I'm-sorry-I'm-being-difficult-blame-my-nationalit\u00ady' smile, but we really do need a table that we can eat at. They point at the next table and tell us to sit there. A group of 4....sitting at a table for 2. Ultimate fail.Clearly, the service has also gone down the pipes--the servers kept walking by as we were trying to flag them down for more drinks and they just gave us the zombie look when we asked for our Bloody Marys to have more of a kick to them.
