The second door which annoys me is the gents toilet door as you end up clubbing it into the body of poor unsuspecting handwashers. Doors aside though, this is a tres bon boozer!",

Walked into the place and stood there for awhile while the people behind the bar just looked at us and didn't greet us or say hi or explain if we seat ourself or need to wait to be seated, finally had to ask and they said to sit where ever so we did and then waited a good 15 minutes and no one showed up to our table. Had to get up and find someone to take our order. Then we order drinks and food and about 5 minutes later they came back to make sure they got the order right. Then after another 10 minutes with no drinks brought to us I had to get up and go to the bar and ask for my drinks again. Got the food before the drinks. And never saw another waiter or server again after that. Such terrible service, really ruined the whole experience even though the food was good. Will never return",

But that cosiness just adds to the charm of the place. And if being cooped up inside isn't your thing, there's a very large beer garden - perfect for both summer and winter. I've visited twice now and both times the food's been decent (and the fact that most people were eating on a Saturday night is a good sign) with a good mix of pub classics. It's not award-winning but it fills you up. Also, if you like your scrumpy, there's three different traditional ciders on tap, plus a good range of ales. Cider lovers would be well-advised to stop by. Ok, so the clientele can be a bit trendy (this is Notting Hill. What do you expect?) but find yourself a corner, grab yourself a cider from the friendly bar staff, and you can happily waste many an hour in a lovely pub world.",

It would not be odd for my friends and I to visit Windsor Castle multiple times in the same week - it is everything you could want and more. Pure happiness. Heavenly, outdoor beer garden complete with a beautifully wise, old tree? Yes. Outstanding beer-battered fish and chips? Oh, mmhmm.. yep. Sticky toffee pudding? \u00a0God, yes. Sorry, I'll take a moment.Nothing was better than sitting outside, drinking beer and for some, the occasional ciggy, with a group of your best friends around the outdoor heaters. Seating can be rough when it's crowded but I promise you, it is worth hours of fun.The word charming almost seems an injustice to this place. The pub itself is steeped in history: it dates back to something like the 1800s, the interior pub is all dark, worn-in wood, there are candles and lit fireplaces everywhere and as Robin S mentioned, there are still TINY door partitions to navigate through. For me, this is pub perfection and it's what I hold all other pubs to.",

Random, interesting, dangerous when drunk, all of the above3. Not on a high street - situated between Notting Hill Gate and High Street Ken, is far enough from each to avoid passing traffic, so people come here because they love it and respect it3 solid reasons should do.

It was an excellent vintage). \u00a0However, my friends seemed very happy with a range of beers, both bottled and on tap; I caught the whiff of a particularly delicious bitter; and there was even the odd wine glass scattered throughout, with no complaints to be heard. \u00a0The food was very good - perhaps not the best pub lunch ever, but really very good - and above everything else, the staff were absolutely lovely. \u00a0In fact as our party grew throughout the course of the afternoon, we moved locations three times without a single complaint, despite the complication of shifting our tab as we went.Such is the charm of this place; you only mean to spend a couple of hours and then the whole day has gone and you don't even realise. \u00a0I'm told that there's a delightful beer garden (somebody mentioned tortoises; is this true?!) but the weather was royally crap so we never had the chance to check it out. \u00a0Oh well, I guess I'll have to go back again. \u00a0Sometimes life is just too tough for words.",

The service is average, not that special, and not that bad! So, with all that said, this place is recommended, hopefully it is recommended on ZAGAT also!",

They had a pretty good selection of cask ales and the food was really tasty. I had the fish and chips. The fish was quality fish and the chips were really tasty. My sister had the sausage with mashed potatoes and gravy. It was also really good. They had us order from a server but then never checked back on us again, it was hard to get anything else. It's like they have table service but then don't actually do it. It's a good stop with good food.",

The first impression when we walked in was not the best, it was like we are invisible, so many staff walked pass by us without acknowledging or even looking at us. It felt like we are invisible :)In the end I decided to go inside to approach ( basically block their way from running) one of the waiters & ask if they got any table available & my husband waited at the bar behind 4,5 others to be served. So when I finally could get attention of one of the waiters( and I can tell you it wasn't easy) he said that the food has to be ordered at the bar) so I went running back to the bar & it was finally our turn but then he said that they are pretty much out of everything specially Sunday's roast ( which was the reason we went there) & the waiting time is up to one hour so we just left & didnt even finish our drink which we sort of were too rushed to order & the really unpleasant unfriendly guy at the bar just wanted to keep the flow moving, I mean he didn't even give us a menu & he wanted us to order something else instead!!",

It wasn't bad, but, no one directed us where to sit when we came in. We roamed around for several minutes while several employees (we later learned, because, they don't wear uniforms) buzzed passed us. It wasn't until I randomly asked one, thinking they were a patron, where the host was, that they revealed they indeed worked there and it was just self-seating. No one was rude per se, just seemed rather disinterested in actually getting people served quickly/efficiently. Not sure if this is a typical pub experience or not.",

It's still a cozy little boozer if you can manage to wrangle a drink and a seat, but the staff barely speak English and have only the most rudimentary bar skills.

We asked the waitress, also foreign, if we could order some chips and she replied \"I think those are done\" and walked off with the menu. Just terrible. It's so disappointing to see a good pub become a victim of its successes.",

    "text": "Set in close proximity to Notting Hill and Kensington in the Holland Park neighborhood, The Windsor Castle Pub might very well deserve a boast as one of the top best food pubs in central London. Food wise, note their menu changes seasonally; here are some favs from Summer 2014: pork-apple bangers on caramelized onion-fig polenta, braised scallops with lardon, smoked Haddock fish pie, toffee crunch cheese cake, sticky-toffee pudding - just a few of the addictions you'll find here.Our server was outwardly friendly and helpful (even by American standards), the menu proved to be both varied and generous in proportions. The crowd is what I would deem as being posh, but not aloof nor alienating. Back garden-courtyard is quaint, intimate and fully green...overflowing with grape vines and tall Horse Chestnut trees (mind your noggin during 'conker' season). All in all, an English charm well worth placing somewhere on your list of pubs to visit. If I were local, I imagine this being my Sunday roast supper terminus.Besides, anywhere that's adjacent to a Peel Street (a la 'Emma') get tops scores from me.",

Shockingly this room has NO CCTV access!Second our teenage children watched a couple move from table to table in this pub, highly suspiciously, from the front of the pub to our room, never ordering food or drink.... then this couple took up the table directly behind us. My son actually mentioned that the strange man motioned to the waitress right before he got up to leave but never ordered anything.... And guess what? Within 5 minutes we realized my purse with everything we needed for our trip was gone!And alas....you'd think our waitress would be distressed, falling all over to help us correct??? Nope, we found her drinking beer at the bar!The \"managers\" let us into their office to spend an hour: calling the USELESS local police (they won't come to do anything btw), canceling our credit cards etc. Then, the Pub \"generously\" called us a free Uber (please read with sarcasm).Last but not least in line this morning at the embassy we met a lovely American girl who had the exact same thing happen on the same day down the street at Churchill Arms in Kensington- so a huge shout out to our fabulous British hosts for being either crooks or f*cking oblivious to a crime ring running in their locals.And lest you think we are \"stupid Americans\" this is our third trip to London (and our last!) we have traveled all over Europe, Asia, North America, Central America and Caribbean and this has been by far our worst experience traveling.",

    "text": "We came in on a Friday night, fairly early around 7pm, to enjoy a pub dinner while visiting London for the first time. We choose this place due to the proximity of our hotel, being on multiple lists for a top pub in London and overall pretty good reviews. We were quite turned off at first, but the night turned around. We walked into to the bar area and realized the restaurant is quite sectioned off without a good hostess stand. All of the tables had a \"reserved at Xpm\" marker on them. Most of the tables weren't even coming in till 9pm or after and when asked for a place to sit, the bartenders/servers said they had nothing available. We thought that was quite odd to hold over 50% of your tables that were empty when you could have just asked us to be off that table within 2 hours. We decided to head to the back open beer garden area to see about food and drinks there. We secured a table, but we realized there isn't a service out there. You have to walk in to the bar to order drinks or food so it would be quite annoying/tedious fighting your way through a crowd just to order a drink. Additionally, we wanted food and so many people were smoking outside we almost just gave up and left. After being quite discouraged, we decided to try and just sit at one of the tables who weren't coming in until 9pm anyways. It was a success! We ordered food and drinks at the bar and sat the rest of the night at the 'reserved' table without any issues. The food was surprisingly yummy and we let satisfied. We ordered the scotch eggs to start, and they were probably some of the best ones we had during our trip to London. Crispy and hot on the outside, but moist and slightly runny egg on the inside. Next we got the bangers and mash and steak sandwich. The bangers were really good. Salt was right, sausage was juicy but crisp and the sauce was quite delicious. The steak sandwich was 'just alright'. Tip: Get reservations or sit at a table marked 'reserved' where you have time to get in/out before the party arrives.",

    "text": "Dear Fellow ForeignersDisclaimer: This visit was on our first night in London, with the stereotypically absent understanding of British pub culture.The vibe here was unreal. \u00a0People were laughing, cheering, and clearly having a good time. \u00a0When I asked the bartender if we just seat ourselves, she just said, \"Good luck.\" \u00a0She was right. \u00a0There is a great beer garden in the back, and ample seating up front. \u00a0It is just a very popular place, and there were a few meet-ups going on. \u00a0It was about 30 minutes before a table opened up, but we were able to order drinks and roam freely with them until a table opened up. \u00a0By the time a table opened up in the bar area, we clumsily heel-toed our way towards it.It took another 20 minutes before I realized I had to go to the bar to order the food (read disclaimer above). The short of it is that the beers and the bartenders were great. I did not recognize one beer on their menu, which allowed me to explore a bunch of different varieties. \u00a0I told them the qualities I look for in a beer, and they matched it up perfectly. \u00a0They really do know their ales.The food...well, I don't know if pubs are one of those places you shouldn't typically order food at, but we did. \u00a0I got a beef sandwich with fries and my wife got a burger. \u00a0The sandwich wasn't bad, but the burger was dry, dry, dry. \u00a0\"Well done\" was an understatement.However, color me charmed! \u00a0We quickly got on with drinking the night away. \u00a0Overall, this is a visit I will make again. \u00a0It was hugely responsible for helping us understand and appreciate pub culture. \u00a0I would recommend it as a first stop for anyone staying in the Kensington area (or thereabouts) if you want a crash course in pub culture. \u00a0You won't feel alienated, but you also won't feel immersed in a pool of fellow travelers dampening the authenticity of this place. \u00a0Plus, the drinks are great and the bartenders know their stuff. \u00a0Going back soon!",

A banging Sunday roast with ALL the trimmings, an excellent real ale line up (and beer in general really), a great boozer garden, wooden quirky interior that hasn't been meddled with too much over the past 100 (+??) years and some great gins. If you committed to trying all of the beers that they have on tap you would need to be carried out of the place. On top of the real ales they have a broad selection of English craft beers, big name brands and international crafties. The wine list could do with a bit of work.There is lots and lots of tables in the booze garden but as soon as the sun is out it does fill up pretty quickly after work and on Sundays. To be expected! Inside there are these small hobbit like doors that you have to duck through and lots of pokey corners to nestle into and enjoy your beer/roast/gin. As I said, it just feels really English. All the food is great but if you're there on a Sunday I would highly recommend the roast. A good place for sharing other menu items too and good gourmet snacks rotate through the menu such as terrine and mussels.",

    "text": "AVOID! LOUSY RUDE somewhat-discriminatory bartenders who can't get an order right in English! (Pub seems to be a hotspot for pick-pockets who may be in cahoots with the barstaff. Read review below by another Yelper on this.)Not sure if service had to do with the fact that most of the people in our group were not white. Would like to think not, but we felt judged - you can see such things in people's eyes. Aspects of how were addressed made me wonder if the barstaff's manners were a function of whatever impolite, uncouth, diversity-lacking country they hailed from!Perhaps the pub has new owners now. I used to live 2 blocks away and this used to be a decent neighborhood gastropub. But now, it's the worst pub ever - spoilt my afternoon out with friends, embarrassing me in the process, as I had vouched for the place.Took 30 mins to get drinks and place an order for food. The bar tender who took my order could not speak English to save her life. She screwed up the order, most of which were burgers with slight variations on the theme. Had to repeat myself 5 times.Furthermore, one of my friends there with me is pregnant and needed to know if some of the food ingredients would be ok for her. They were completely callous about taking her order and understanding what she could or couldn't eat (rare meat, unpasteurized cheese). She ordered a non-alcoholic drink (a cordial) which they basically served without any cordial in it, just soda water. When she complained that it tasted like soda water, another rude, snooty, French bartender said \"so what's the problem? It's non-alcoholic\". Same snooty bartender had no problem flirting with other customers who cut in line, while ignoring us as we ordered drinks.It took more than an hour and 15 mins to get us the food. They kept saying \"5-10 more minutes\" but no food appeared. And finally the rude Frenchwoman said, \"like I said, you'll get the food when the kitchen has cooked it\". Completely ridiculous! We eventually cancelled our order and left. What is clear is that their waitstaff, who couldn't speak a lick of English or didn't have the decency to understand our order and pay attention to it, are the rudest bar staff I've encountered in all of Kensington, having lived there for years. Spoilt our evening, not to mention that they didn't give a damn about a pregnant person in our group, who clearly needed to stay on a dietary schedule with some restrictions.I will never go back and will make sure all my friends in the neighborhood hear of this.",

    "text": "Fell in love with the Windsor Castle Pub, after a lovely autumnal walk around Holland Park. We found this pub on YELP. \u00a0 \u00a0Arrived in the pub just after 12 noon, after racing up Camden Hill \u00a0Drive in order to avoid the threatening dark clouds of an impending rainstorm. I feared the place might be crammed with locals on a Sunday afternoon. Turns out we just beat the rush, and picked a fun dark booth, near the bar, at the front of the pub. We needn't have worried. It seems most of the locals preferred the lovely garden area \u00a0in the rear courtyard, as the sun had returned. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What a fantastic interior! Yes! I can see why Canucks would be enchanted by the very traditional, historic decor... The dark woods, rustic booths, benches and stools...fun tiny doors, to either step through or duck under.... and ever-challenging depending on the number of pints consumed!  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 We each ordered a pint of 7.3% alcohol organic cider, from the cheerful & friendly staff. It sounded very innocent, but as I reflect back on it, this is basically like ordering a litre of very tasty, very potent, healthy apple juice, that can go down very fast! (By the way, this place has a fantastic selection of ales, ciders, & wines)! Predictably, it didn't take long before the high alcoholic content kicked in and thus more and more giggles \u00a0began to emanate from our booth.  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Happily, our Sunday roasts arrived soon after (beef for him, chicken for her) so I could have something solid on my stomach. \u00a0(I was beginning to wonder if I could even STAGGER back to our flat on Palace Terrace Gardens -I didn't particularly favor giving \"The Colonies\", a bad reputation.) The roasts \u00a0and veg were solid, but nothing spectacular. (Next time I am going to try the highly rated fish and chips!).....However.... \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 the STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING was TO DIE FOR!!!!.... far superior to any other that I have ever sampled in the rest of the galaxy. \u00a0Now admittedly, it is pretty hard to dislike sticky toffee pudding. However, we are certified gourmands with regard to this particular food group, and we are one tough lot to impress in this category. We even have our own coveted secret family recipe for sticky toffee pudding - so we do tend to take this dessert VERY seriously.  \u00a0 \u00a0 The pudding at the Windsor Castle Pub, was light, moist, with lots of raisins.The toffee sauce also was light and just the right amount of sweetness. The scoop of REAL vanilla ice cream was the crowning glory. \u00a0This was the perfect portion to share with a loved one. \u00a0 \u00a0My advice to Frommers: forget recommending the smelly \"Churchill Arms\", (with it's creepy, dusty, weird memorabilia crammed everywhere and hanging all over the ceiling)... Walk east a couple of blocks and experience a much pleasanter pub atmosphere. Join all those with the \u00a0YELP app, who highly rate the \"Windsor Castle\"!!! I gave this pub a 5 star rating because locals obviously loved it, fantastic authentic decor, cheerful friendly staff, good service, nice food, great selection of ales etc, and one unforgettable Sticky Toffee Pudding! :)",

    "text": "I have been going to the Windsor Castle since I was a student living in the West End in 1995, and every time I am back in London I specifically make an effort to have a few pints in one of my favourite pubs. For a Yank, The Windsor Castle captures that idealised view of the quintessential British Pub. Dark wood, brass, creaky floors, history, etc., this place has it, but the true bonus is the killer beer garden out back. It is one of the best I've found, and makes for a great location to lazily waste the day and night away. The Sunday Roast is always on point (if they haven't sold out), and the beer and cider selection is excellent. I am predominantly a cask ale drinker, and their selection has always been generous in the bitter department. I know my wife and friend loved the pitcher of Pimm's lemonade which was loaded with cucumber and fruit. Service here has always been above average, and the location is extremely convenient, maybe a 5-10 minute walk from Notting Hill tube stop, and really not that far away from Kensington High Street. Also, this place makes a great stop on a Notting Hill pub crawl as its only a couple blocks up the road from The Hillgate.",
