    "text": "After reading lots of reviews about this place, had to give it a go! The place itself looks like it has been modeled on how old private clubs would have looked back in the day.We went to the bar, it's not a typical bar where you can stand around, you are seated by one of the waiting staff.The ambience and surroundings are pretty flash & the drinks and food are expensive. All the drinks were pretty small - the Rhubarb G& T was really nice but SMALL! Service was very slow (we ordered a shot each of the Imperial Vodka when we arrived, however, it came out AFTER our starter - the place was not really busy and the bar was very close to us).None of the staff spoke Russian- not that that really matters but it just reminded me of a gimmicky place, a bit plastic & overpriced, more concerned with their money income rather than making your experience that bit more special.At least at other expensive places, you get little extras like nice complementary bar nibbles, etc that make the whole expensive experience worth it, leaving you with good memories, wanting to return.Overall, it was a nice eve but I think that was because of the company not the food/drink.I didn't feel we got value for our money \u00a0- they even added extra glasses of wine on to our bill - for the prices they charge and the fact it wasn't that busy, more care should have been given to the bill.Overall, it was a nice experience, but I'm sorry to say that I don't think I'd bother again.",

    "text": "I'm trying to think of a way to describe the sheer opulence of this place. It is the physical manifestation of all those images of hidden old English clubs were Lords would gather to discuss important issues and change the fate of England. It's full of dark mahogany, green leather seat cushions, and booths that manage to seem secluded even though they are next to each other.We went for a \u00a0friend's birthday and, given that we had a group of 10, we were told we had the private dining room as it was the only one big enough. I cycled over from work and, because I had been told it as fairly fancy, I brought some dress shoes along to boost my image (cycling shoes aren't exactly semi-formal wear). However, I probably lost any chance I had at looking respectable when I handed my helmet to the coat check girl. It's London, cycling is a popular way of life.Anyways, the hostesses are excellent gatekeepers, subtly blocking my way while inquiring if I had a reservation. Upon learning which group I was meeting, I was led downstairs and through the booths to the back room which is apparently the private drinking room. There we had a dedicated waiter who provided me with an decent Old Fashioned although I must say it was slightly sharp on the whiskey which indicates to me they didn't take enough time with the preparation. Still, it was more than palatable so I had a second.When it came time to eat, they insisted on carrying our drinks for us and led us upstairs, through the restaurant, and into the private dining room. This room is awesome with all these retro decorations on shelves. I'm talking old school robot toys, original edition boardgames, and a massive backgammon set. We could decide if we should play or just outright steal it. We decided to eat and drink instead which likely saved us from some jail time. Good life decision.Foodwise, I went with the snails for the starter and Onglet steak and chips for the main. The snails were tasty but I was disappointed that they had already been deshelled. Attempting to extract a snail from the shell is the most fun of eating them! The Onglet was medium rare (we weren't allowed to order to taste, only medium rare for some reason) and it's a steak that speaks for itself with minimal cooking. However, the chips were fantastic so I'll forgive them from depriving me of a bit of blood.I can't comment on dessert, sadly, as we had an excellent home-made chocolate cake instead. The recommended dessert wine (I think it was a Sauternes) was incredible and if it wasn't \u00a330 a glass I would have got one all for myself. We ended up sharing between four but it was a very generous glass so not a problem.Price-wise, this is on the higher end of restaurants even for London. Including drinks and service, it came to about \u00a380/person. I'd say it was worth it for the atmosphere and drinks and marginally worth it for the food. Maybe a good place to impress a date (say on the 3rd date...too exxy for a 1st date spot imho). Location is great (just across the street from Polpo and next to Graphic Bar) and very central.",

Sadly, I appear to be losing... though if I thought that the reward was a guilt free burger at BBR then I'd be spending a lot more time on the rowing machine.There's a limited menu, mainly classic bistro dishes intermingled with a handful of left field caviar based choices (no doubt a small reminder of home for the Russian owner).The decor wouldn't be out of place in a top end French railway buffet (assuming that said buffet were decorated with beautiful blue leather seating and staffed by men in salmon pink jackets). The staff were attentive and friendly and while I had to ask twice for the bill, I wasn't exactly in a rush, and could quit happily have sat there all day.Starting with a sharp yet sweet pink grapefruit mimosa, I eagerly awaited my meat patty fix..The burger arrived cooked perfectly as requested, enough fat to make it silky smooth with little pieces of onion studded through. A nice char on the outside contrasted with the soft bun and the Kraft slice melted deep into the pores of the unctuous patty. The sweet pickles were excellent, and the only (very slight) bum note came from the slightly flabby and seemingly unseasonal tomato.As I polished off the last morsel, a salmon pink jacket dropped off a warm hand bowl and I sat back in my booth. The glamour of Bob Bob Ricard is a contrast with grimy old Soho, but somehow fits in perfectly.",

In other words, not too sexay, if ya know what I mean.However, BBR makes it work - and in spectacular style.The booths are retro cool, and the lines of the interior are art deco. The marble, brass, stylized fonts, and little details (e.g., a button purely for champagne is at each table for you to order your refill) are transporting and make you feel a little off-kilter in a \"Through the Looking-Glass\" way. This is not a bad thing.The food was quite good. I had a Shepherd's Pie, and it was lovely to look at and lovely going down. It was already very savory, flavorful, and rich, so I was thrown off by the server's suggested inclusion of Worcestershire sauce. My arteries could do without, and the pie was perfectly fine on its own, thankyouverymuch. Maybe I'm a little bit of a cheapskate, but the prices seemed a little much for glorified comfort food (e.g., their rusk, ginger, etc. milkshake is 6.50 squids...which translates to a $10 milkshake. I mean, what?)Overall, a good experience with friendly and attentive service. However, I'd say it's more of an experience destination than a place that would enter my regular lineup...um....were I living in London and if I had a regular lineup, that is.",

Photos do not do this restaurant justice, it must be seen in person to really appreciate how beautiful it is. It's apparent that like everything else at Bob Bob Ricard a lot of thought has gone into the design of the restaurant. The service was excellent, efficient and attentive with out being disruptive. I was there for a Vodka tasting, after drinking Smirnoff neat once many years ago and not remembering it as pleasant (it is my spirit of choice for cocktails), I was surprised to find that a \"good\" vodka goes down much more smoothly. We were served shots at a temperature of -18. In true Russian style we were given various foods (Jellied Ox Tongue, Salmon Row on Hard-Boiled Quail's eggs, Malosolo Cucumbers) to chase each shot which was a relief to my empty tummy! Various different price ranges of vodka were tasted, I favored the Kauffman Special Selected Vintage 2006 for having a touch of sweetness to it, even though as were were told the aim of vodka is to be tasteless. We also had a selection of starters, all of which I would highly recommend. The Scallops and Black Pudding as well as the Wafer-Thin Cured Orkney Beef being absolutely delicious and completely satisfying to my taste-buds. I look forward to many visits to Bob Bob Ricard to introduce my friends to such a unique fantastic restaurant.",

    "text": "Having never officially 'tasted' Vodka before, I had absolutely NO idea what to expect at Bob Bob Ricard's tasting (a Qype event organised by Qype London Guru, Siany). As it turns out, it's nothing like wine tasting AT ALL. With wine tasting, you look at it (a lot), sip it, swill it around in your mouth, make appreciative noises like Mmm and Ahh, then say things like: The legs on that are rather impressive, don't you think? While doing this you nibble on things like cured meats, cheeses and smoked salmon blinis talking about how they complement your wine perfectly. When you taste vodka on the other hand, you knock it back then quickly take a bite of a bizarre salt-saturated Russian snack. You know what though? I thought it was absolutely brilliant, despite being incredibly dubious about drinking neat vodka with my meal. But hey, they do it in Russia all the time apparently! We were expertly guided through a range of vodkas served at BBR by co-owner Ricard, including the Kauffman Private Collection Luxury Vintage 2003 \u00a0only 25,000 bottles were produced and at \u00a318 per SHOT, it's something I could only dream of being able to afford. The general consensus of the group was that our favourite was the Kauffman Special Selected Vintage 2006 (about \u00a38 per shot). So we all had another one at the end. I was also impressed by the Imperia by Russian Standard which, at \u00a34 a shot, is much more in my price range. In terms of food, I got the opportunity to try things I'd never usually dream of ordering like Jellied Ox Tongue with Creamed Horseradish (which was surprisingly delicious), Salmon Row and Quails Eggs (hmm... not so much) and Scallops and Black Pudding with Truffle Dressing (SUPER yum!) I also was very impressed with the Wafer-Thin Cured Orkney Beef and Pickled Beetroot and Goat's Cheese Salad. You can see all my piccies of the wonderfully unusual food (if you like) at: foodspotting.com/?query=\u2026  Everything was enjoyed in a beautiful private room adorned with Art Deco-themed decoration. This is definitely a restaurant with a big 'WOW' factor (helped immensely by their 'Press for Champagne' buttons at all the tables) and I cannot wait to get the chance to go here again.",

    "text": "I joined some fellow (extremely lucky) Qypers at a Vodka tasting here on Sunday and frankly I'd like to come back here every week. (Any chance of organising that Sian?) The first thing you notice as you enter is the opulent art deco stylings and attentive service from the staff, the banquette seating around the main part of the restaurant looked ideal for sinking into as you settle down for a long afternoon. We were in a private room round the back with a golden chandelier, interesting art work and a selection of vintage childrens toys on the walls. Unusual, yes, but it all worked rather well and the dark room helped us forget that, after the clocks had gone forward, to our bodies it was only 11.30. The signature drink of Pink Rhubarb Gin and tonic helped take the edge off and was delicious with an impressively frothy head. Our host for the afternoon was Ricard, who co-owns the place with his partner Leonid (or Bob, who has a 2 thirds share..) He took us through a selection of Vodkas stressing that the original point of the drink was not to impart flavour but actually to remove it. Through different processes of filtration, quality of ingredients and distillation the aim is to get a flavourless drink that just gives that slight alcohol burn at the back of the throat. The general consensus was that the closest to this was the first one we tried, the Kauffman Special Selected Vintage 2006, which had a slight sweetness but was otherwise almost neutral. I was also quite keen on the Imperia by Russian Standard and that is lucky because at \u00a34 a shot as opposed to somewhere in the region of \u00a315 for the Kauffman this is slightly more in my price range.. We were served food with each vodka and my favourites were, perhaps surprisingly the Jellied Ox Tongue with a delicious Creamed Horseradish and less surprisingly the Meat Pelmeni. These little dumplings, similar to Polish Pierogi, and served with Sour Cream and vinegar were incredibly more-ish and I think an afternoon scoffing them with a jug of Imperia would be quite fantastic. We were too full for a roast dinner after a selection of starters including beautiful scallops with black pudding and some blueberry cured Orkney Beef but I did have a rather tasty Cheese board. So, this place is fantastic, probably out of my usual price range though but I would make the trip for a special occasion. If it was cheaper I could quite happily come back every week, although maybe that is a good thing for the state of my liver.",

The Wonkerish press for champagne button, the Pullman booths, the truffle, champagne and caviar laden menu. And of course there's Leonid (aka Bob) leaning rakishly against our green leather booth. Champagne? he said, after all, it is Wednesday. I love this sort of almost-too-luxurious, over the top place, all green leather, dark wood and art deco tiles, like some glam and stylish Al Capone speakeasy transported to a twenties Moscow back alley. My chosen starter was a beautifully prepared venison tartar. The seasoning was spot on with no Worcestershire or Tabasco needed. Unctuous, smooth, meaty with a strong, but not overwhelming taste of deer. I could have had this for starter, main and dessert. Hell, i could've scoffed this bambi for elevensies and been happy. Quails eggs and truffles showed deft handling of strong flavours. Instead of overwhelming the creamy eggs, the truffle added an intense bouquet of earthy richness. And the prawn cocktail was a pitch perfect rendition of the fifties classic. Big juicy pink prawns hung like punch glasses around a bowl. Roast leg of lamb was tasty, a classic example of well sourced meat, cooked simply and brilliantly. This was actually as good as my mum's lamb, which is not something I've ever been able to say of any restaurant roast lamb. Veal Holstein was flawlessly executed, with a wee little quail's egg fried and laid atop the golden crispy crunchy plate of tender cow. This was good stuff. And it came with smooth, earthy truffled mash, and a hidden pool of seret sauce...shhhhh. And the pudding \u00a0oh my God the pudding. A masterstroke of menu choosing here, I went for the comparitively plain sounding salted caramel ice cream with oh, some other flavours. Spooned into my mouth after a shot of frozen vodka, the sweet-savoury tang made my toes curl and squeezed a little jig of pleasure out of my tapping feet. So, BobBobRicard. Big, bold and somehow still well balanced. Not for a daily visits, it'd tarnish the allure. But when the world's crashing down around my ears, this is the place where I'll be partying. Going down, all hands on the champagne bottle.",

I love Bob Bob Ricard and echo the sentiments of all the other glowing reviews and scratch my puzzled noggin at some of the complaints I've read in some of the less than pleased reviews. There's something about this place that reminds me of going out in New York or making a pit stop at a classic roadside diner in New Jersey. Attentive service, a no-fuss but lengthy menu, great booze, reasonable prices, terrible cozy booths and the art deco/mid century modern swank ... All that in middle of London Geez ... it makes the bland, corporate coffee shop I'm sitting in right now seem even blander and drabber and almost an insult to my tastes and senses.",

    "text": "My search for the best burger in London brought me to Bob Bob Ricard. Upon entering I felt like I was time-warped into a distant era---one of sheer opulence with highly trained uniformed butlers. My decadent orient express-esque booth came with not one but 2 champagne buttons. That's right, there was a button that said \"press here for champagne.\" Of course, it's gimmicky but oh it's so cool and as our server demonstrated it actually works. Unfortunately I was battling a cold so no champagne for me. On that note the cocktail list looked amazing so next time I need to have a few drinks with my meal! My friend raved about the Pink Rhubarb Gin & Tonic.As for the burger---it was great, though not in the all-time best category, quality meat with crisp streaky bacon and some nice pickles on a fresh bun. As Bob Bob Ricard offers many Russian delicacies, I started with some zakuski---small Russian appetizer plates. The cured herring was great and the cucumber surprisingly simple (it was 1/2 a brine soaked cucumber sliced down the middle). Zaukusis are best served with vodka and there is a selection of shots with which pair your hors d'oeuvres, but alas my cold prevented me from imbibing. All in, it's an expensive eclectic experience and probably one of the few restaurants globally that serves both high-end Russian & British fare... definitely worth a visit.",

    "text": "I came here with a friend last night for dinner after having seen a photo of a friend with their famous \"Press for Champagne\" tableside button. What a brilliant idea! It's a Russian inspired restaurant, and there are a number of dishes on the menu marked as Russian specialties, but there are also a number of normal options like steak and seared sea bass. We were seated in a very spacious booth, and I thought it was pretty private, as the restaurant was dimly lit and we couldn't hear the tables next to us at all. For starters, we went for their Grilled Oysters de Gaulle and Baked Oysters Mrezhnev, which were both pretty similar, basically cheesey cooked oysters. In hindsight I probably wouldn't have ordered both and should have probably gone for some of the raw oysters instead. For my main, I got the lobster mac n cheese and my friend got the filet mignon. I really appreciated my lobster mac n cheese... it came with an empty lobster tail on top, and inside there were large chunks of lobster. It was also the perfect size. While our meal was not particularly Russian, I think it was a great spot for splurges like lobster and filet mignon, both of which were very well executed. \u00a0After our meal, we moved to the bar to have a final glass of champagne, and I thought that was a beautiful area as well. I would probably find the whole place a bit overwhelming for a date, but I would definitely come again for a nice meal and/or drink with good friends.",

    "text": "This is hands down the coolest place I've eaten at in London. The interior alone is worth the visit and I guarantee your pink-blazered waiter will not disappoint on the service front!BBR is a mixture of old-school opulence and American eatery - think The Criterion fused with The Diner and you're not far off the mark. Tables are well sized and the booth seating is perfect for four people to enjoy a meal in relative privacy. On each table there is the now infamous \"PRESS FOR CHAMPAGNE\" button. It took us all of 5 minutes to hit this and order a bottle of the Pol Roger which was really well priced at \u00a357 (you should read up on their wine pricing policy).I kicked off with the Egg Florentine which was a perfect foil for the champers and the egg was perfectly poached (just like mine always turn out at home of course). For main I had the potato and mushroom dumplings with a side of Brussel sprouts and chestnuts for the seasonal edge. Two bottles of the 2006 Chianti were consumed during the course of the meal and by the end of it I was mildly pissed up and quite full.Post-main, we indulged in a shot of the home-made Zubrowka. Possibly the highlight of it all for me as I bloody love Zubrowka! Tasted amazing, with a much stronger grass flavour than its commercial brother and served beautifully in a chilled cut glass. I challenge you to not love it!The perfect place for a boozy client lunch with a difference. It is erring on the pricey side but more than worth it considering the attentive service and variety the menu offers.",

That evening came sooner than planned when we arrived at nearby Koya to find people queuing halfway down the block.Initially we were turned down at Bob Bob Ricard when the hostess cited no tables available. Given this was our third stop of the night and that I was, by this time, rather ravenous I inquired about seating at the bar. Sure enough, we were whisked to two comfortable seats at upstairs. Unable to resist the siren-like call of the clear bloody mary I had one of those whilst my dining companion chose a glass of red wine. For you curious kittens, the clear bloody mary is made by extracting the juices of the tomato overnight. It arrived with a bottle of Tabasco and another of Worcestershire. Amazingly, the cocktail was spicy enough just as it came (and trust me, that is rarely ever the case with bloodys in Blighty.)We both ordered burgers and french fries and I was excited to be able to get mine with a Kraft slice (you can take the girl out of Las Vegas...)The burger was the best I've had in London and when I'm hit for a serious craving for one again, this is where I will go. However, the fries did not come out until quite a bit after the burgers (and after we asked after their whereabouts) which was disappointing. If you like mayo, definitely ask for a side of it here - absolutely gorgeous.Skip the cakes plate. None of them were particularly special to me and left me wishing I'd ordered something else or skipped dessert all together.Should you desire to dine on a classic American-style burger and fries whilst sipping expertly made cocktails created by pink jacketed bartenders, Bob Bob Ricard ought to be on your must do list.",

It's always exciting to see how it will be served. I had never heard of this place so was intrigued. I didn't expect too much from here, but was pleasantly surprised. I love a good interior and the lush art deco theme in Bob Bob Ricard had me all giddy!Initially I only wanted the Afternoon Tea, but the waitress was able to up sell me to the Pink Lemonade & Afternoon Tea. I heard elderflower as part of the concoction and I was sold. Not sure what else was in it but as long as it had elderflower. I had no regrets in ordering the extra Homemade Pink Lemonade, it was gorgeous.Good scones are what make or break the Afternoon Tea. These aren't the best I've had, but they are good enough that I'd go again. They are very generous, that can be a problem. When the scones are gone, we are still left with the very pretty looking cake selection O_o and of course you do not want to let those pretty lil cakes go to waste. They are only bite sized. But size is so deceptive!Overall I really enjoyed BBR. Tis a classy place with great service - loved the waiters jackets.",

I heard about this place from my fellow food lover and fellow yelper Enid S, and I always trust her recommendations. There's an upscale feel to it, and from the moment you walk in you're treated like royalty (pretty much). The 1920's/1930's decor is apparent throughout and the booths provide a private and intimate ambiance. They have a lovely selection of food for lunch, dinner and afternoon tea, and also provide a set menu for those indecisive individuals. The staff paid attention to my every need (possibly a bit too much attention and I think they needn't help me with my coat as it made me feel like a bit of an invalid)!BBR is one of my favorite places at the moment! It's definitely somewhere up there in my top 5. Great place, great staff, and great food! Bravo!",

The meals were all delicious, my friend Nadya order some kind of fish, I don't remember the exact name, but was good. We had from those minus 18 degrees shots of vodka, very nice too.

Plus extra special waiter attention complete with the history and happenings of the place since it opened 3 years or so (it replaced Circus Circus)Very cool, chi-chi and I look forward to being lucky enough to be invited back again.

It's like some lady is living here making sure the world behind the beautifully polished rosewood doors is a land of perfection. I've heard afternoon tea here is the done thing but I actually popped in for a cocktails. They have white Bloody Mary's which to be honest are more clear than white. They are fabulous and just as juicy as any other I've had. They have wonderfully little booths to sit in which are so cosy and make your experience feel even more special and private.This is a place to impress, a place to propose and a place to surprise someone with. Just a visit is like a present! If I could go here regularly I would, I want to come back for dinner!",

I'd seen the photos sort of thing but being there in reality etc... Anyway, the booking was a last minute affair so we had a late table. I loved the feel of the restaurant. It's modern and classical at the same time, its a perfect combination. The menu is imaginative and yet simple. The wine list was complicated but not overbearing. I went with three \"clients\" so i think perhaps the company wasn't exactly right to absorb the really, glamorous and romantic vibe of this superb restaurant - hence the four star. It's definitely the sort of place you take a lady on her birthday. I shall be back bob and review you in the right company. Wait for me x",

    "text": "I was so close to giving this 5 stars, but I'm holding that extra one back for somewhere that completely blows me away. Bob Bob's was almost there.I went a while back on a Gays & Gals night out - 2 gorgeous gay men and my friend and I, all lovers of food and fun times. We select very carefully for these nights out and this place was my choice. I had no idea it was at the top of the scale when it came to ostentation and styling; I'd only read that the food was great and some of the more serious restaurant critics had praised it.Art Deco glitz and glamour leaves you momentarily winded with pleasure. It's special this place, and you feel special just being there. The staff do a good job of reinforcing that feeling too with their slick but convincing geniality. If I looked at this place on paper, I might be put off. It would surely sound over-inflated, full of pomp and pretension; but actually, for all it's blingy expensive fittings and fixtures (think gold sparkly floors and ceilings, crystal glassware, marble tables and electric buttery blue leather banquettes) it's really rather un-intimidating somehow and dare I say, cosy. Perhaps that has a lot to do with the lighting - soft and sexy, which an opulent environment like this deserves. The place is humming. It feels alluring and exciting. I'd imagine Christian Grey (Forty Shades) would frequent this place if he lived in London. Say no more! So, the food. Did it let the side down? No, certainly not. In fact, it just pushed it right up there towards that 5th star I very nearly awarded and consummated my new love for the place. Clearly, a talented brigade rein in Bob Bob's kitchen and the menu has lots of rather simple dishes that have just enough pizzazz to make them their own and justify the price tag! My prawn cocktail was like no other I'd ever had - it had been given a Bob Bob boost and was stacked so prettily on the plate, I felt guilty diving in to it. My duck breast was achingly tender, sealed with rich, crispy edges that added another dimension to its texture. There were many other dishes, followed by desserts and copious amounts of wine. And yes, the bill was fairly hefty, but nothing more than you'd expect in town, and certainly not more than we thought it should be.Would I go again? You betcha. Old Bob Bobs is a winner. Through and through.",

This restaurant takes you on a journey back in time to a beautiful era of art deco wonderland, yet manages to deliver a delicious, well crafted comfort food menu. \u00a0 Most people are surprised to hear this delightful restaurant serves breakfast, as well as lunch and dinner. The booths are comfortable enough to spend a few hours in the morning toasting your own selection of breads and crumpets (they bring a toaster, with all the trimmings to your table) with a cup of tea, putting the world to rights or sharing a bottle of fizz on a romantic date. \u00a0 The food is absolutely delicious, the chicken pot pie is probably my all time favorite dish there and I'd highly recommend it to anyone. Don't be put off by how splendid the restaurant looks, it actually more affordable than it seems!",

Nestled away in Soho, the dining room is adorned with brass fitted booths, high ceilings and waiters dressed in candy pink waistcoats AND if that wasn't enough, they have a button you can press for champagne...I know right?!The food is described as a mix of British/Russian and there's everything from caviar and oysters to steaks and lobster on the menu as well as an astounding offering of vodkas.For starters, I went for the venison steak tartare which was delicious - this can be some people's idea of food hell (raw steak/egg) but for me it's perfection!Main course for me was always going to be tornado Rossini -28 day aged scotch beef with seared foie graid and confit apple served with truffle gravy. This was nice but had nothing on the tornado rossini which I've had at the Bull in Bisham. If you're ever out that way, make sure you go!Make sure you save room for dessert - my 'Eton Mess en Perle' simply stole the show. Lime meringue, strawberry sorbet, raspberry, marshmallows which desolves into a delicious mess once you're waitor has poured over the cream!",

The sauce was beautiful that went with so good to have some bread to soak it up. Also had the venison tartare which came with a quail egg. Great presentation and a good eat.We did press the button for champagne and it was a nice touch albeit gimmick to have.For mains had the beef onglet. Nice puree and gravy. Need to order a side of chips with this though to help compliment it.The signature Chocolate Glory is a visual spectacle as its glistens in gold and as the server purs over chocolate it bubbles and cracks open. However this is a very rich and very heavy dessert that is best shared. It's not really my thing unfortunately. What was more my thing was the light and fresh strawberry souffl\u00e9. Again poured over with cream but this was a delight to finish off with.Overall the service is of the highest quality to go along with the food. All this comes at a price but I also loved the d\u00e9cor. Somewhat reminds me of the Grand Budapest Hotel (film). Thumbs up all around.",

He had the raspberry souffl\u00e9 and I had the sour cherry souffl\u00e9 for dessert - amazing! Service was excellent - very professional and courteous - they were very happy to answer all questions. The restaurant was inspired by the d\u00e9cor of the Orient Express. Classic art deco d\u00e9cor. They also have a 70's inspired dining room downstairs that is a red version of the upper dining room. It was a feast for the senses. Dinner was pricey, but worth every bit. One of the best dining experiences I've ever had. We will definitely be back again when we're in London again.",

    "text": "This review is only for the eton mess, but what a unique and great eton mess it is. My boyfriend loves eton mess, so we decided to give it a go. The dessert comes served in a ball shaped strawberry meringue with marshmallows, fresh raspberries, lime meringue pieces inside. It is topped with a warmed strawberry cream sauce, which smells unbelievably great. The server pours a bit on top after he brings the dessert to the table and then you can pour the rest throughout the course of eating it. It is small, but it's delicious. Elegant, unique, creative.The only thing I was apprehensive about before going was the attitude most restaurants at this caliber have. It's expensive, it's upscale, and a lot of times that translates into rude, impersonal, stuffy, and lame. This restaurant, though, had character. Yes it's old school, upscale, and still a bit stuffy in the sense that the waiters are overly polite, very serious, and the food is over-priced. But the place still maintains personality by the fun wall paper, decor, colors, and dishes. The restaurant is decorated in blue and teal with some quirky designs on the wall. Also, they have a \"press for champagne\" button at each table that you can literally press for champagne to immediately be brought to your table. We asked about it and apparently it gets used quite regularly.The tables, are marble as is much of the bathroom, which is located downstairs by the entrance. There are a whole row of individual stall bathrooms for your use, all very clean and certainly flashy. There is also another dining area downstairs, which is much less calm and more bustling than the main dining area upstairs. It's fit with a full bar as well.The dishes and cocktail options here are creative, well presented, and not outrageously expensive for the type of place this restaurant is. If I wanted a fancy, but calm dinner in a more traditional setting, I'd give this place a try because it's a bit more innovative than other restaurants in the same category. But if you don't want to eat a meal there, then just go for the eton mess. It's really worth trying.",

    "text": "Champagne, wafer thin truffle slices, ginormous Beef Wellington, scrumptious desserts, pink and silver. That is my Bob Bob Ricard summation. Good enough for Yelp? Probably not.When first walking in, it can be overwhelming because the BBR staff might outnumber you. After handing off my coat, we were escorted to our table. I was struck by the rectangular lines, silver and pink Christmas trees, and light pink decor. May I consider staff decor?Their staff is certainly friendly and attentive. They were a continual presence as they refilled water glasses and champagne crystal. Staff was slightly absent-like when we were nearing our table deadline (2 hour mark).I sampled nearly every item my friends ordered. There were 12 total dishes that came to our tables - starters, mains, and dessert. I delighted in my Zakuski Russian sampler in miniature, slurped my smokey Borsch, closed my slackjaw and then savored my first Beef Wellington, and forced my amazing pannacotta on my friends.I love fine dining and I love London. Thanks BBR for a memorable experience.",

    "text": "Wow! This place is special indeed.I went here to celebrate an anniversary as we wanted to go somewhere really special. The outside looks like a 1920's Gatsby building, and when you walk in you instantly feel glam!The seating area in the restaurant upstairs is really cool - it sort of looks like vintage train seats with tables as you are sort of cordoned off from the other tables with little curtains behind you. I suppose you could call them vintage train booths!Everyone loves the 'press for champagne' button and I did take photos of it but I did not use it after seeing the high prices of everything on the menu.The starters were nice but nothing amazing for the prices and they were really, really small. The drinks were delicious but still felt a little overpriced...I suppose you are paying for the experience and atmosphere here, too.The main that we had was the beef wellington which I can say was truly amazing...very delicious, huge and filling and cooked to perfection. The sides were delicious and the sauce complimented the wellington really well.The pudding (I had the infamous chocolate ball which is a MUST) was amazing...an entertaining sight in itself! The waitress poured hot chocolate over this golden ball of goodness and I took shed loads of photos before it melted in front of my eyes. The inside of it was a lovely surprise of several different flavours and I really enjoyed it. My favourite part of the meal for sure.There is also a downstairs here where there is a great bar and performances, so ask the staff when you can go there as it isn't always open. The decor in this place is incredible and the service is great, but if your pocket can't afford it I would give it a miss as you might feel like you were a little robbed.",

    "text": "BBR provides a grateful environment, however, the service and food are quite disappointing. I had dinner reservation booked to welcome my friends arriving from the States. On the day of the booking, I received a voice mail confirming the booking and subsequently returning the call to confirm. Immediately thereafter, my booking was unexpectedly cancelled. I had to make another phone call requiring additional efforts in order to secure the table. During the dinner, the Salmon tartare was stale; the Beef Wellington for three people was priced for 4 people without including the 4th portion; and the fish pie was excessively salty. Most of all, one of the friends had diarrhea following the dinner. This is our first, perhaps last time dinning there. We do not recommend this restaurant.",

To go even further, Bob Bob Richard has amazing decor, with beautiful chandeliers, and pink and gold details making you feel like your in a Tiffany's catalogue. The food is amazing! \u00a0For the first course the potato vareniki is a must, with amazing hints of truffle. The crab salad was good, but cannot compare to the vareniki. \u00a0We had the baked sole and the medallions Rossini both of which we cooked and flavored perfectly and I would highly recommend. For dessert the chocolate glory is beautiful, and very nice but I preferred the refreshing Eton Mess Perle.",

    "text": "My friend and I came here to celebrate her birthday. I loved it from the moment I walked in. Staff were very welcoming and friendly and once we were seated and ordered our drinks, our waitress asked us did we not want to press the infamous 'press for champagne' button and so said she would go away so we could press it and then return to take our order! We were obviously trying to play it cool by not getting excited about the button but loved that she humoured us! We decided to go straight to main courses and get dessert. I ordered the chicken Milanese and my friend had the lobster mac and cheese. The presentation of the mac and cheese was really impressive and you get a good sized portion and it tasted great, although my friend wasn't so sure it was worth the \u00a325. My chicken was really nice, but I wasn't sure about the garnish/sauce on top. I ordered fries to go with it and the portion was large, enough to share. You have to order any vegetables/potatoes etc separately, dishes don't tend to come with them, which isn't uncommon at nice places. We shared a chocolate fondant for dessert, which was delicious!! The sauce that came with it was so good, it was minty and tasted really refreshing. A strange one, but so good! I loved the decor of the restaurant, the colours and different textures, it felt really luxurious and you feel like you are on a yacht or something. This place is probably more of a special occasion kind of place due to the prices, but I loved it and can't wait to go back. I would probably rate the good 4/5 but the overall experience definitely 5/5.",

What a way to start my first visit here.The atmosphere reminds me of a modern/20s feel and it blended together well. \u00a0You do need to be kind of dressed in biz casual. \u00a0Appetizers--Siberian Sturgeon Caviar - Why not it had a really mild flavor to it-Siberian Pelmeni with beef tea - this are dumplings style which had lamb and beef - recommend-Salmon Tartare Imperial Main Course -1st visit - Beef Wellington - this serves 2 so if you come with a larger group, make sure to order enough. \u00a0It takes 45 minutes for this to be cooked but its a quick 45 minutes lol.Bob Bob Ricard serves the best!!!!! Beef Wellington ever. \u00a0(they used scottish beef) \u00a0The pastry was perfectly baked, the beef filet wrapped in truffle and foie, and the meat cooked perfectly. \u00a0The first bite was amazing, I was in heaven. \u00a0I have never ever tasted anything so delicious in my life. \u00a0I enjoyed each bite, the explosion of flavors and deliciousness... I cannot explain it more than saying you have to try it for yourself if you love beef wellington and if you have never had it, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?? GO ALREADY!2nd visit - Chateubriand \u00a0- Also from scottish beef. \u00a0Very good but not as good as the beef wellington off course!Sides (both visits) - -smashed peas-Truffled mashed potatoes-smashed peppered cornI was surprised they charge for bread and butter, but oh well, the food was worth it!Dessert (both visits) - -Trio of sorbets and vodka - -Signature Chocolate Glory Bob Bob Ricard will be the first restaurant I eat at during the first nigh of all my future London trips because of the Beef Wellington.",

    "text": "Bob Bob Ricard is a decadent stylish venue of perfection.Everything from the decor, staff, food presentation are absolutely top notch.Upon arrival, we were taken to our table in the Blue Room on the ground floor. It was quite dark, but lit well enough that you could see the dark blue wallpaper. Note there is another smaller room downstairs aptly named The Red Room. Apparently you can't pick the room when booking, however think Blue for nice and relaxed, Red for a little more excitement.Food was mostly good. Prices were quite high, and you're clearly paying for the ambience and decor of the place. Food was generally good, but the chips that came with our meal were too salty, and the fish pie I ordered, whilst having a lot of seafood, didn't include any mash potato. Being a mariners fish pie, you expect seafood in a creamy cheese sauce, followed by mash, then topping. All the food however was extremely rich and the starter, some Russian dumplings was divine.Dessert was a sublime signature Chocolate Glory. A golden ball with hot chocolate poured over. Whilst melted the gold to reveal a dessert of chocolate brownie, mousse and passionfruit, orange jelly. Definitely one to share and quite impressive. I wish I had taken some video.In all, this is a place where presentation and style take precedent over everything else. Great for a special occasion but not a place you'd feel entirely comfortable eating at unless money was no object.A 2 course dinner plus cocktail and shared dessert will set you back around \u00a370 a head.",

After the dinner we got home, I felt full and my stomach felt very heavy, like I had a rock in there.

I started with the mushroom and onion dumplings, which was almost like a pasta in a light butter sauce, followed by the Chicken Kiev (breaded chicken stuffed with spinach). The chicken was really juicy and the dish was flavorful. My husband had the Imperial steak tartare (with caviar on top) and the Boeuf Bourguignon. He loved both. Finished the meal off with two chocolate truffles. You could definitely taste the bourbon. Really great service. Would highly recommend for a nice dinner out.",

Thought to myself, maybe they don't serve steak on hot plates in London...randomly had an Uber driver who was a chef and he confirmed for me that plate should have been hot, even just for sanitary reasons.

We clearly chose the wrong night to come to Bob Bob Ricard as there had been a power outage. However, despite these circumstances you would think a distinguished restaurant would know how to handle such situations. Wishful thinking. There was no communication to us about the fact that we couldn't order from 85% of the menu and there was no attempt to rectify the situation (besides offering 1 complimentary glass of \u00a39 Malbec).  In the end we had terrible grumpy service, subpar (cold) food and a bill far too high for food we didn't even want to order but had to because we were starving and had no other option. There are hundreds of options in this city for a fun, romantic delicious night out and I am so bummed I didn't pick someplace else.",

    "text": "Although I had a fun time with my friends I have to say that I've had equal if not much better experiences elsewhere at half the cost (or less). The vodka shots at the start certainly put us in a good mood but they also glossed over the less positive aspects of the dining experience at the time. On reflection though the experience was distinctly average. For starters, their cocktails and drinks are incredibly overpriced for what you get. I had a g&t (double) which cost \u00a325 which is pretty high even by London standards, though it would have been okay if it had actually tasted good or been served in a larger glass than the tiny one they served it in. I chose the Truffled Potato & Mushroom Vereniki as my starts and Salmon Tartare as my main, which although really well made quite tiny. I can accept that starters are small but certainly not the main course. Perhaps I should have chosen one of the more expensive dishes, but at \u00a316.50 I would still expect a decent portion. It was fun having the champagne button there, but the novelty really wore off after the first time, and it probably would have been cheaper to order a bottle anyways instead of pressing the button and getting a glass instead. Overall, a fun evening but at a very steep cost for what I actually got served. Glad I've tried it given the reputation but I won't be going back anytime soon.",

We've been fans of this dish, since our days in London back in the 1990's, and we've attempted to make Beef Wellington for holiday meals with meager success. And, it was worth it! We shared an absolutely delicious Beef Wellington (for 2), and it was prepared to perfection! Just outstanding. We began with the Salmon Tartar and the Crab with Chilli and Avocado - refreshing and large enough to savor as a starter. I should add that the super-cold vodka shots were a bonus! That was followed by the Beef Wellington and a salad. And we concluded with the Flaming Creme Brulee, which was quite good. The decor takes you a bit back in time, and the Russian influence is obvious and quite nice. Don't be fooled by the \"elegant\" attire request - some were dressed in nice, yet definitely casual clothing (which was regrettable). Next time we're in London, we'll be back.",

My friend ordered a cocktail but it wasn't to her taste so they remade it and even recommended and served her a different drink for no additional cost. The cuisine is Russian inspired and it was pretty tasty but not mind blowing. The truffle fries are worth trying though. They're crispy and loaded with truffle powder which is different from any other truffle fries I've had. We also shared the Truffled Potato & Mushroom Vareniki, Mariner's Fish Pie, and the Lobster, Crab & Shrimp Pelmeni. Flavors are quite unique and interesting but I wouldn't say amazing.For dessert, we loved the Strawberries & Cream Souffle. It's airy, sweet and well balanced. If you're looking for a better than average souffle, then I recommend trying this one.My friends and I also got some strawberry champagne to go with our meal. After all, we came for the \"press for champagne\" bell!Overall, I struggled to decide whether to give this a 3 or 4 star rating. The food is definitely not the spotlight here and is a bit pricey but I'd come back once in a while for the atmosphere and experience.",

If you're looking for tepid peas in a cold caviar tin, try Bob Bob if your local pet shop is out.

The one thing making the meal not completely regrettable was the strawberry souffl\u00e9, which is not as like-worthy as the chocolate bomb but perfectly cooked.

We also shared a salad and some bread (which if you ask for more they charge you extra). The worst part was that I made reservations to celebrate my husband's birthday and he was not a fan by the end of the meal. Service was good but honestly the flavor was severely lacking in every way.In hindsight I gather this is more of a place to go just because it looks interesting inside (and sure they have a button to press for champagne) but those things aside, I'd recommend saving your money for another place in the city.",

We decided to order a bottle of champagne, a few appetizers and focus on dessert. The Beef Wellington looked divine do I would like to come back and try that someday. The lobster macaroni and cheese was every bit as decadent as expected. My friends like their beef tartare. The only reason this isn't 5 stars is because I didn't think that the gorgeous, melting desserts we'd been dying to try were as tasty as they were pretty. We tried the Eton Mess en Perle and the Chocolate Fondant. Both desserts were served with chocolate shells that melted when topped with warm sauces.

Now that I have been, I side with this place is a definite place to try. The venue itself is unique and has a flare for the dramatics and endearing. Art decor theme with part godfather feel, part Russian oligarch. \u00a0A lot of attention in the details from the floors to the napkins and booths. We sat downstairs, which I believe has more of a romantic feel. The food was brilliant, I remember I wanted to order different things, try different things. Its a fusion of Russian and bistro. Deserts was amazing too, finally got to try that instagramable chocolate ball thing. Very rich, and very fun. Customer service was top notch, every staff was hand on deck. The cost was dear though, and not something I can do everyday, but thoroughly enjoyed myself and glad I went.",

If you can request to be seated downstairs, the atmosphere is much better! You want to take a million photos down there because the space feels so special. We were seated at a big booth along the wall, with a bucket for champagne waiting tableside and a button to call for drinks on the wall. Although the champagne is the theme, we started with cocktails (and still rang the Champagne button :) )! The Passionfruit Martini was a perfect girly drink to start off our girls night right!Food wise, my friend had been here before, so she spouted off all her favorites and we ordered pretty much everything she loved - Baked oysters, Potato Vareniki, Sole stuffed with seafood and champagne sauce, and truffle mashed potatoes. We also ordered the corn to make sure we had enough side options. If you like truffles (like I do!), our menu is for you- as the oysters, Vareniki and potatoes all come smothered in delicious truffle sauces.The baked oysters where honestly the best thing I've ever tasted, cheesy, truffle-y, and melt in your mouth. If you weren't going for a full on meal, you go in, order drinks and baked oysters and your in heaven!! We're big eaters though, so we continue..The Vareniki could have been skipped in my opinion, good, but not out of this world. They are essentially a take on potato dumplings, but I preferred the truffle mashed potatoes. Paired with the Sole stuffed with scallops and other seafood, this meal was one for the books! No room for dessert this time, but I'll be back!",

We arrive and....everyone in the restaurant was wearing jeans, or casual clothing (one group was in yoga pants and sweats!). We felt super uncomfortable in our cocktail dresses, and would've gladly worn something more relaxed, had we not been told otherwise. Wish we had known.",

I had heard that this place is kinddddddaaaa a letdown. But I still wanted to go. I took myself there during the week. I was sat at the bar, which was fine. I ordered everything I wanted. Steak tar-tar AND steak AND fries AND bread AND dessert AND champagne AND a rhubarb gin and tonicI think it came out to about \u00a370, which I'm like.... ok, that isn't a TERRIBLE price for such a posh dining experience. But was it the best meal I've ever had? NO!!I do like that it's opened very late. My dinner reservation was at 10pm, and could have been even later if I had wanted it to be! The steak was pretty good. I did enjoy the steak tar-tar as well. Portions were kind of on the small side, but again, fancy restaurant. The decor is amazingly beautiful though. And I think it would make a great spot for a late night dessert and drink. Their signature dessert is actually not to be missed. It's chocolaty and has a fabulous presentation. I heard that they are offering 25% off on Mondays.",

The \"press for champagne\" buttons and lavish art-deco decor caught my eye and I suggested this restaurant for our \"fancy night\" of the trip! Reservations are necessary and the dress code is \"elegant\", though I noticed a bit of a range from nice (dark jeans and a blouse) to full on gowns among our fellow diners. Though we were a few minutes late for our reservation (got stuck behind a protest in our Uber and had to walk the last few blocks!) the staff were friendly and accommodating, seating us immediately at our table with, as promised, the \"press for champagne\" button! I ordered the chicken kiev and my friends had the steak tartare and the Bavette steak with truffle sauce. We also shared the Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and the BBR signature chocolate glory for dessert. All of our entrees were delicious! The chocolate dessert was beautiful and very yummy (and fruity), but as a whole we preferred the Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, which arrived flaming and delicious! I felt like the experience and quality of the food and service was very on par with the price of the meal, so even though it was nicer than I would typically choose it was worth it! A really nice experience that I would recommend.",

The restaurant itself is stunning; everything is opulently decorated from the pink and gold china to the gilded walls and luxurious \"press for champagne\" button at each table. Unfortunately the food just didn't match up for me. My friend and I started with the crab and avocado salad and the shrimp and fish dumplings. The dumplings were good but nothing to write home about while the crab salad tasted like very fishy crab with a smear of avocado cream. It was not fresh tasting at all and I honestly took two bites and the decided that was enough. For our entrees we had chicken Kiev and the Dover sole with lobster champagne sauce. The chicken was excellent but my Dover sole tasted a bit off and the creamy lobster champagne sauce was a bit heavy. Perhaps the food just wasn't my taste, I was just hoping for better. I did love the side of roast vegetables though; they were easily the best thing we ordered. I would come back to Bob Bob Ricard for drinks as the atmosphere is amazing but might skip the food next time.",

You want a button by your table you simply press to get a glass of champagne? \u00a0Three words: BOB BOB RICARD. This is where you should go. Im sure you are well aware of the Gatsby-ish interior if you are reading this review so ill keep it short. Lets just say its stunning either you end up in the red or blue dining room. How about the food then? Yes the food is up to par with the rest. Here is what we tried on the menu: *Oysters Brezhnev (5) delicous high quality parmesanbaked oysters topped with truffle. Whats there not to love? *Pelmini with a beef/tea broth (4,5) \u00a0Delicious little russian dumplings in a gorgeous broth packed with flavors. Very good!*Beef tartar with foie gras (4) The tartar was very good as well with cute little cubes of foie gras as a nice touch. While it was very good it was not the best i have tried. For the luxurious ones you can also top this dish with osetra caviar....*Beef Wellington. (+5!) Wow this was the most amazing Beef Weelington i have tasted. The puff pastry was beautiful and crunchy on the outside and light and fluffy inside. The steak was perfect medium-rare and the truffle ju together with the duxelle layer was packed with umami flavors. This is not cheap at 90 \u00a3 but its a royal dinner for 2. \u00a0We skipped the sides and where happy as we could barely finish the delicios beef. Service was friendly without being overbearing and the champagne button is a must try (duh....). \u00a0One can argue that its expensive as the total check was almost identical with the one we had at 2 Michelin star \"Dinner by Heston\" but its really two completly different restaurants even though i give them both 5 stars. Would love to come back.",

Chicken pie, again fine, did the trick but that's about all. Lobster mac and cheese, from the hype i had heard, pretty disappointing. Side of carrorts, fine.All of the food needed extra seasoning.Dessert, the creme brulee and eton mess.

I had the crab salad and salmon tartare which were both fine, but nothing to write home about. \u00a0The salmon tartare had a mass of overly sweet pickled fennel on top which I think took away from the dish. \u00a0The fennel was also simultaneously really acidic and gave the raw salmon a strange semi-cooked texture. \u00a0Perhaps I ordered the wrong dishes as two of my friends really enjoyed the beef wellington, but to me the meal was a bit underwhelming.",

Because BBR seems to have gotten even better since I went not long after they first opened. And they're really really good now. The private room is stunning (and you absolutely have to nose about in the bathrooms) and the services is impeccable. Am I ever going to order salmon roe again? Nope. Will you find my in the bar drinking more rhubarb gin 'n' tonics than is good for me? Yes. Even that's got better since my review last year. I love it here. Wish I had an excuse to come back more often. * Oh my goodness I've died and gone to Art Deco heaven. This. Place. Rules. Seriously, it's one of the best restaurants I've been to in London. I came here last night for dinner and we had such a lovely time. The meal was fantastic and the service was second to none. They've got a bar downstairs, but that wasn't open. Despite us initially not wanting dinner, they were happy to let us sit in the restaurant and have drinks. but, of course, we ended up eating anyway. It's not cheap here. Not at all. In fact, with extras and sides and champagne and stuff I imagine your bill could easily shoot through the roof. But, a cheeseburger was an acceptable \u00a312.50. Yes, it's a lot. But it was the best cheeseburger I've had and my friend agreed. Most mains will set you back about \u00a320. The drinks are fab. Although I wasn't a big fan of my Rhubarb gin and tonic - not enough rhubarb in it and it comes in a teeny tiny glass. but the wine was great. It's the service and decor that makes this place stand out. Toasters on the tables at breakfase. A button to push if you want champagne (soooooo close to pressing it just for fun). They've got the art deco thing bang on. Stunning bathrooms. The service was just the right side of attentive. but only just. We all agreed that had they been any nicer, it would have been irritating. But we were charmed, fed, watered and left happy and a bit in love with the place. It was quiet, and I think it would be much nicer for breakfast, but the menu is a bit all over place so I imagine it's still trying to work out its niche. Cocktails, wine, dinner etc and we only spent \u00a325 per head with service. Worth every penny.",

Wikipedia confirms our suspicions: it was built in 2008. \u00a0But it was an admirable effort, Bob. \u00a0Bravo.It's beautifully decorated, faux or otherwise; deep red leather seat backs, overly-ornate brass railings, wall-splayed mirrors with a hint of cigarette-steeped tarnish (though of course it was built after the smoking ban) and an angular logo all add to the lush allure of 1920s opulence. \u00a0Add a couple of flip-up bus-stop seats and a floor decorated like a gigantic backgammon board and you're in business.I've not eaten here but the cocktails are splendid. \u00a0Yes, they're expensive, but I've pondered whether or not this deserves the loss of a star and frankly I don't think that it does. \u00a0You can see the menu outside. \u00a0The upmarket style is obvious. \u00a0If you're greeted by a maitre'd and two assistants who silently take your coats and whisk you to a lovely corner booth without so much as a by-your-leave, you know you're in for a treat and you ought to know you're going to have to pay for it. \u00a0At roughly \u00a310 per cocktail, it's not astonomical, nor is it a \"quick drink after work\" type of a venue . . . but maybe one to pull out of the bag if you're planning to impress a date. \u00a0It's got the mood lighting, the table service which just verges on the right side of overly-attentive, the exquisitely-presented drinks and enough atmosphere to give you something to talk about when the conversation runs dry. \u00a0You can't pay for that.Except you can. \u00a0It'll cost you \u00a310 a drink.That's just cheap at the price.",

This is the most preposterous, stupidly expensive pile of pretentious nonsense in the whole of London. There's no doubting the effort that has gone into the hilarious d\u00e9cor, reminiscent of the Orient Express in the 1930s, and the attention to detail in all the fittings, and the comfort and privacy of the booths. But the food is so gut-wrenchingly bad, pointless and random, and so outrageously expensive for what it is, served by sneering, half-witted waiters, that this place should be closed for offences to basic decency. I am baffled, just baffled, that this moronic establishment is popular and well-regarded.",

    "text": "I have been here twice now: once for dinner and once for breakfast. Overall, great place, good food. Dinner. Started with drinks at the downstairs bar. Struck me that they were a little understaffed as it took a long time to get a menu and place our orders. Rhubarb gin and tonics are stunning - but very easy to drink quickly. Overall, I think their prices are too high on cocktails. Bar snacks (blanched almonds and olives) do not reflect the high price of drinks, although the olives are tasty. Music selection of the bar is terrible in my opinion, it should be better matched to the decorations which is more jazz and lounge. I wish they would also turn the lights down as it felt like we were in a Weatherspoons. The booths in the restaurant are superb. A great way to make you feel relaxed with your fellow diners, and also feel a little private. Champagne call button is a great idea. When I ate their the champagne trolley was unavailable. However, did try their champagne and I feel they have got their pricing totally wrong. No glass for under \u00a312. I know the place is upmarket, but in reality who is going to press the button for another glass when they are notching up at least \u00a312 each time. Also, no bottles under \u00a3100. Ridiculous. Food was great. I liked being able to have a breakfast/brunch item as a starter - I opted for the Eggs Arlington which was very very good. Mains were fine. Desserts seemed a highlight. The souffles were stunning. Breakfast. While it lacks the buzz of the Wolseley, it is a great places for a quiet business breakfast or a late lazy brunch. Coffees were ok but not great. Service was very attentive, polite and professional. Toasters on the table is a great idea but I thought the bread selection was poor. A plain white and wholemeal option, with no sourdough. I cannot believe they have the cheek to charge over \u00a33 for a bowl of cornflakes! Price. Not the cheapest of places and perhaps a bit more expensive than the Wolseley its nearest competitor. But enjoyable and very stylish. I think a late night dinner is a great way to enjoy this place but easy on the champagne unless you want an astronomical bill.",

    "text": "please also seehungryinlondon.com/2010/\u2026  Food and Wine Blogger dinners are a great opportunity to meet and socialise with other food bloggers and enjoy good value food in interesting restaurants (thank you Niamh for organising!). This time it took place at Bob Bob Ricards in Soho. Bob Bob Ricard is a super stylish and decadent, Russian themed restaurant with \u00a0very importantly \u00a0a pink champagne emergency button on each table; the evening was off to a promising start! It indeed commenced very well with the BBR signature cocktail \u00a0a delicious rhubarb gin & tonic (7.5). In fact I have to say that all the drinks to come were delightful. However, I personally was not convinced about the food. After having read all these enthusiastic reviews out there and when considering the clearly higher than average prices, I would have expected more. For me, the food lacked finesse and sophistication and was in general confused. The first 2 courses were to be enjoyed together with chilled (-18 degrees) vodka (very nice vodka indeed: Vodka Imperia by Russian Standard (4.75) and Vodka Kauffman Special Selected Vintage 2006 (7.50) paired to the respective dishes). We were explained exactly how first to sip the ice cold vodka, immediately followed by a some food \u00a0this did add an interesting aspect to the whole experience. However, I still did not particularly like the ox tongue in jelly with horseradish (7.50) and neither was I very convinced about the second starter. I mean it was not bad, Russian salad with fresh shavings of truffles and some thin toast on the side just seemed a bit crude and did not quite do it for me. I think I have discovered for myself that I am not keen on the combination of mayonnaise and truffles. I have to say that I found the main dish hideous. The whole concept of veal holstein (21.50) seems somehow wrong in general and sadly also seemed wrong at Bob Bob Ricard: A lovely veal escalope in bread crumbs (basically a Wiener Schnitzel), very nice by itself, disappeared in an amalgamation of random flavours: it was lying on top of mashed potatoes. the potatoes were seasoned with truffle oil. then there was the quail egg on top of the veal. and some anchovies and capers.some crispy bacon on the side, and some tomatoes. Did I forget anything? Oh yes, the secret sauce. a major culinary confusion, I just think very often less is more The dessert Chocolate Glory (8.74) was fun.It basically looked like a a gargantuan Christmas ornament. Hot chocolate sauce was poured on top and revealed an inside of Chocolate mousse and brownie as well as some fruit jelly. Even though I actually quite enjoyed it, I again thought there were just too many different parts randomly combined. Have I mentioned that I am a firm believer in less is more? I had a lovely evening, I met nice and interesting people, I liked the atmosphere, the style and the booze and would full-heartedly recommend Bob Bob Ricard for drinks in a pleasant and different atmosphere. However, for me the food was a failure For pictures of the food I refer you to An American Cupcake in London (they site to follow if you love baking). (We got served a set menu for 40 pounds including drinks \u00a0I have however indicated the prices as they appear in the normal menu.)",

Decor was pleasant, service was ok, not brilliant but certainly not bad either. I opted for the eggs benedict, my friend had the eggs royale. It come with bread to toast yourself in the provided toaster. This was all very well but the toaster took about 15 minutes to toast the bread. When the food come, my eggs benedict was at best luke warm! Now I hate to sound snobbish, but when I am paying \u00a325-\u00a330 for breakfast, I am sorry but I don't expect to find 4 stonking big thumb prints around my plate. Maybe down the local cafe but not in a supposedly 'fine dining' establishment. I would bet any money that this place will be gone inside 2 years. A typical example of all style and no substance. I have had better breakfasts for less than a tenner, in fact maybe even less than a fiver!",

    "text": "This place is freaking awesome. Imagine, in your mind, a glamorous 1930s art deco restaurant. It's got glass and brass and tables for two. It's got a cool bar in the basement, with little fold-down seats in alcoves and ice bucket baskets. The servers have uniforms, and they fuss over you. There are fringes of velvet, chain-link dividers topping the booth walls, and eveything is polished. Every object in the place also bears the logo of the establishment. This place is twice as nice as you're thinking it is. And not only is it retro-cool, but it has the touches the other reviewers have mentioned: toasters at the table for breakfast so you can make your toast precisely the way you like it, and hot. A button at each table to call for champagne. Polished granite. Coat hangers secreted in slots alongside the table. Yes, it's pricey. An English breakfast is nearly \u00a313. But it's one of the best I've ever had (the egg's yolk was deep orange, the black pudding was moist and flavourful, the coffee rich and delicious). Same for my wife's eggs benedict. But you could also get toast and jam for less than \u00a35, or some grapefruit, or a bowl of porridge. You don't have to splash out if you don't want to, there's a range of choices and prices. It is too expensive to be my regular, but for special occasions I think this place is super. This is posh retro done right. It opens from 7:30am for breakfast, and it's open for lunch and dinner, too. The basement bar opens at 6pm and stays open until 3am! It's an all-day experience. I can't say enough about the service. Smiles, everyone, smiles! Go. Go, or be doomed to a life less fulfilled than it could be. EDIT: 07-Dec-08I hate to say this, but I have to downgrade BBR a star based on my experiences there last night. A group went for a Xmas dinner. The food was fabulous, although the dinner menu isn't extensive and it is a bit pricey. The service was top-notch. In fact, it was a little too much. There seemed to be large numbers of people milling about our table at all times. In their effort to try so hard, it seemed like little thins kept going wrong: a glass was dropped and shattered at our table, and a tray of water was tipped over onto our bags. I don't hold any ill will, they were definitely accidents, but the whole service felt a bit pressurized. And though we got great service in the bar downstairs afterwards - which we were about the only ones in - and some really great drinks, the A/C was pumped way up so that it was FREEZING. We asked them to dial it back, and they did, but it's hard to believe they could have expected anyone to sit there. The restaurant's only 2 weeks old, so I hope they sort these growing pains out and go back to being perfect.",

Invited to a tasting by the good people at Qype, our group were treated on arrival to a deliciously delicate rhubarb gin & tonic, followed by a selection of fine Russian vodkas, punctuated with some robust Russian snacks to help us stay focused. If I were advising general visitors (or at least those who would flinch from paying \u00a315 for a pour of the admittedly smooth Kauffman Private Collection Luxury Vintage), I'd strongly recommend the Russian Standard Imperia at a very reasonable four-pounds-something a shot, accompanied by a plate of meat pelmeni (\u00a312.50), which are best described as dumplings for kings (pairing well with, er, vodka). For the less adventurous, but equally demanding, I hear their burgers are a triumph. Service at this stylish Anglo-Russian eatery-cum-vodkary is as impeccable as the aqua upholstery is opulent. And if you're still not satisfied, just press the button.",

    "text": "For photos see Greedy Diva @ greedydiva.blogspot.com/\u2026 \u00a0Bob Bob Ricard is fun. Lots of fun. A whole big bucket of jumping castle fun. I will declare my heart on my sleeve from the outset. I love Bob Bob (real name Leonid). I love Ricard (real name Richard). And I love vodka (real name vodka). Sure, BBR fed me free shots of vodka all night. But, I'm Australian - it takes a lot before the beer goggles (or vodka goggles, as the case may be) take effect on us. I was not actually expecting to like BBR quite so much. It's glitzy, extravagant and over-the-top in every way - so often a warning flag that there's a bit of style over substance going on. But I managed to bag a place along with a table full of other bloggers to Bob's Vintage Vodka tasting in mid February, so I thought I'd give it a fair shot (pun intentional). Naturally, this was not your average dining experience - unless you habitually shoot 8 shots of vodka with your meal - and our every whim was entertained by the fabulous owners who dined and drank with us all evening. I haven't yet dined at BBR incognito, but plan to go back based on my positive experience thus far - so this is not a critique of BBR so much as an enthusiastic rant about their fabulous event at which I was a paid for guest. And I must declare another interest - I'm a vodka girl from way back. However, my vodka appreciation has always been more in the nature of late night mindless enthusiasm, often involving a martini glass, so I was interested to hear some of the theory behind the madness. One does not enter the world of BBR without noticing the interior. It's glammed up, eccentric, flamboyant and quirky, from the gold fittings and green booths, to the marble and leather, and the much spoken of \"Press Here for Champagne\" buzzers. The intention is to be something of a morning til late \"Wolseley style\" brasserie. I found it much like stepping into a scene from Alice In Wonderland. This is not a place for cynics, but walk in with an open mind and you might end up enjoying yourself as much as I did. Despite appearances, BBR specialises in old fashioned, posh(ish) British fare, with the frequent Russian twist. We kicked off proceedings with the BBR Signature Pink Rhubarb Gin & Tonic, which was lovely and refreshing and intended to sum up the ethos - fun, British and extra pink. Then the real business began. First up, the Vodka Kauffman Special Selected Vintage 2006 (RRP around \u00a370), paired with jellied ox tongue with creamed horseradish. This was my favourite vodka of the night, and one of my favourite courses. The ox tongue was prettily presented and the bite of the horseradish cut through the delicate aspic and meat beautifully. The Kauffman Special is a wheat vodka made from a single harvest in a vintage year - soft and pure, it's the lack of flavour that makes a good vodka (signalling less impurities and more thorough distillation and filtering, sometimes involving silver or quartz). The less you can taste, the better it is. This concept is one that's tricky for the hardened wine drinker to get one's head around. Nonetheless, the message was that the vodka clears the palate, warms the soul, and is to be followed by a mouthful-of-food chaser to enhance the food's flavour. It didn't always for me, although it certainly cleansed the palate. In any case, I enjoyed the whole ceremonial aspect of shooting from a small, kitschy vodka glass before tasting my food and I'm seriously contemplating introducing the ritual around the home kitchen table. Our remaining courses proceeded as follows: The Vodka Kauffman Private Collection Luxury Vintage 2003 (RRP around \u00a3140) served with caviar, blinis and sour cream. My heartfelt love of blinis is no secret. Intermission bites: Wafer thin cured Orkney beef with a celeriac salad, fresh blueberries and roasted hazelnuts; pickled beetroot and goat's cheese salad with fresh mint; potted shrimp; and a delicious rabbit, foie gras and date terrine. Next was the Russian Standard Vodka (popular in Russia, and retails here for around \u00a315) served with Russian salt-cured herring, raw onion rings and new potatoes. The food was delicious. The vodka tasted like vodka. Imperia by Russian Standard was served with salmon roe on hard boiled quail's egg. The Beluga (our first malt based vodka for the evening) was paired with quail's egg mayonnaise with anchovies. Again, a surprisingly tasty combo. The Vodka Beluga Gold Line (another malt based vodka) was paired with some scrumptiously moreish meat pelmeni (Russian dumplings consisting of pork, beef and chopped onions - delicious with either vinegar or sour cream). We finished up the tasting with 2 Stolichnaya vodkas - the Vodka Stolichnaya Gold served with salo on rye bread (lard - not my thing, but was rapturously devoured by lard loving Lizzie) and the Vodka Elite served with malosol cucumbers. These were the vodkas with the most impurities, to be scoffed at by",

    "text": "I just don't get this place. We had lunch on a Saturday and in spite of recent (positive) Time Out reviews, the place was half empty and dramatically lacking buzz In the middle of Soho, 50m away from both Picadilly and regent Street, Bob Bob Ricard still hasn't quite started to engage Londoners. They have achieved something pretty bad, ie BBR (as they like to call the place since the name is not really great) looks and feels like it's part of a chain while it's not! It is a D E S T I N A T I O N restaurant, our (French, extremely nice and attentive) maitre d'hotel told us. The problem is that while they have clearly spent a lot of money to turn what used to be a minimalist 90s restaurant (Circus for those who remember) into a kind a art deco railway station restaurant (St Lazare?) meets TGI Friday meets Tim Burton Maybe it was the blue or pink wastecoats of the waiters or the clear lack of experience of the staff (apart from the M.O.) or the fact that it all looked too new and half empty. Then the big (and real) disappointment was the food. Nothing really worth talking about, nothing special, the mash was supposed to be delicious and it wasn't, the hamburger was nice but at \u00a312 really steep, the tomatoes and pasta not that good really Overall a big disappointment. They do have a few original features, like the toaster on teh table or the champagne button (at \u00a312 a glass according to a reviewer below!), but BBR feels too much like trying to entertain without the substance nor the consumer success (so far). So I will stay away, at least for a while while the tweak the offering (the waiter did confess that the menu was going to change). It could be a good place for breakfast as their menu is really more about breakfast (think about the toaster!) than dinner (few main courses and a steak at \u00a328 pp with 4 person minimum order!). But since they are open from 7am to 3am every day apparently, it is a good name to keep on the little black book as so few decent places are open that late. In any event have a go, it IS different and I hope you will have a better experience than me to talk about on Qype",

My best dinner out in months.The facade is subtle and easily missed but for the two pink jacketed liverymen who let us in to their strange parallel universe. Everything about this place is weirdly retro, polished and ultimately sublime. Seating is in comfortable booths with single seat tables (!) at the front and larger ones for groups. The lighting evokes a speakeasy but the formal uniforms would fit at the Ritz, if they weren't flamboyantly pink. In the end I stopped trying to understand this conjuration and just enjoyed it.The menu offers breakfast, lunch and dinner options all day as well as a full range of drinks from milkshakes to vodka. First order of business was to hit the champagne button and we went with their Rose (to match the decor). Sadly I didn't get to press it again as the staff always materialised the instant my glass approached empty. Food-wise I had pickled herring, meat pelmeni and a peach compote brule prompted by reminiscences of \u00a0the Russian countryside (the owner is also Russian). \u00a0The entertainment continued with the ma\u00eetre des r\u00eaves suggesting vodka to accompany the pelmeni, which appeared at the appropriate moment chilled to minus 18 degrees.One final comment, it was amazing to be served by attentive, enthusiastic well-trained staff who clearly enjoy what they do. There was never anything wanting and I will definitely be returning either for dinner or the members bar downstairs. I cannot recommend it enough.",

Confidential come here. \u00a0but don't expect the service to live up to that glamorous vibe.",

    "text": "I think I'm in love with this place. The beautiful turqoise accents, the weird little retro robot toys sitting on the shelf in the private room, the chandeliers, the hot pink, the china - everything. I came here with some othe lucky Qypers for a vodka tasting and sampling of some delicious Russian nibbles (there was promise of a roast too, but we were all so full from gorging ourselves on yumminess, we couldn't even fathom having more food!) Truth be told, there are some off-the-wall items on the menu that the faint of heart (or stomach) might not go for. However, I'll try anything once - and things like jellied ox tongue or salo (pork fat served on rye bread) were surprisingly good. Must give a major thumbs up for the salted caramel ice cream too! It's not cheap, but for a special and gastrologically adventurous night out, it should be your top choice in Soho.",

For a Saturday it was super quiet but that may have been due to the footie. I'd love to come back and try some vodka and Zakuski (things like salmon roe on quail's egg and Russian herring) which reminds me of an amazing Latvian meal I had round at my friend G's flat in Paris where we drank enough home-made vodka to make our hair curl, but woke up hangover-less and happy \u00a0these Eastern types know a thing or two about having a good time. But instead we plumped for starters and mains. First things first, you must start with cocktails \u00a0an amazing Rhubarb G&T and EL G had a refreshing BBR Botanical. For starters, El G had cured orkney beef and celeriac salad with blueberries and hazelnuts and I had the potted shrimp with baby watercress \u00a0like everything we ate that night I loved the interesting flavour combinations which were perfectly balanced - both were really tasty. I heard the chateaubriand was amazing but at \u00a332 it was a bit out of our price range, so I ordered the veal holstein with anchovies, a quail's egg, truffle mash and secret sauce which was beautiful \u00a0amazingly well cooked, really light and incredible textures and flavours. El G had the chicken kiev (well surely it would be authentic here?) with sweetcorn mash which again was perfectly cooked and tasty. We washed this all down with a lovely bottle of chablis (\u00a335). We were impressed at the lack of giant mark ups in the wine - not that we could afford the more expensive bottles, but the wine list shows how much other restos charged for the same bottle (often double). We finished off by sharing a plate of cheese with the most creamy brie I've ever had and a glass or merlot and port, followed by home-made chocolate truffles and coffee. We felt incredibly spoiled and left really happy after 3 hours of totally unrushed but great service which for me is the sign of a great meal. The bill came to \u00a3170 or \u00a385 each so it ain't cheap but it was a wonderfully different, luxurious treat and I'm definitely coming back!",

    "text": "Many thanks to Qype for inviting me along to the vodka tasting event here. Having heard great things of the art deco interior, 'press for champagne' buttons and famous burgers, I'd been itching to go for ages. First up I have to comment on the decor. It's an art deco masterpiece, all green and amber glass, mirrors, mixed woods, dark romantic lighting and a touch of the members club. You'll know instantly if you love it or not - but rest assured there's nothing else like it in London. Seated in the private dining area off from the diner-goes-glam main restaurant, we were greeted with the amazing rhubard gin and tonics (you MUST have one if you go) and then worked our way through a menu of various Russian style canapes to go with our vodkas. Some weren't really my kind of thing; I wasn't keen on the jellied ox tongue, salmon roe on quails eggs and goats cheese with beetroot. Others - scallops with black pudding (has someone been watching Masterchef?), salted cucumber and potted shrimp I enjoyed a lot more. The general rule seemed to be that salt ruled, because it works so well with the clean flavour of vodka. I oversalt everything so this didn't bother me, but bear it in mind if you don't like it! Though the burger is - and probably will always be - the bestseller, I really recommend the meat Pelmeni, a kind of Russian take on the dumpling / dim sum. Served with sour cream and white vinegar, they were a huge hit with our group - perhaps because their dense stodginess soaked up the \u00a315 a shot vodka we were tasting! Puddings were also gorgeous - I went for chocolate fondant with pistachio ice cream, which was gorgeous. The salted caramel ice-cream seemed to be a winner too.",

    "text": "I'm another of the lucky vodka tasters from the weekend and long story short, I rather like BBR. The tasting was excellent, with interesting drinks, good spiel from Ric(h)ard and tasty zakuski to mop up a portion of the alcohol - it's not often that I turn down a Sunday lunch due to snack based repleteness, and I suspect I'll have to go back sometime and see what I missed out on. The food was all very good, with standouts of jellied ox tongue (which the other attendees' fear of jelly allowed to come in my direction a good few times), blaeberry cured beef and meat pelmeni (the russian 'meat wrapped in pasta like thing' dish, which so far for me is winning against the similar things from various other countries). Having a quick look at other diners' plates as I left and scouring the menu there's an interesting variety of comfort food with the occasional more refined twist which looks good, although by no means cheap. We may have been there for an event but the staff seemed to go about their duties in their normal manner - efficient, friendly, polite and all in all great. The place looks good, the service is excellent, the food is tasty and the vodka is cold. You pay for the experience, but you get your money's worth.",

Love the decor, never happier than when in a warm banquette, love the champagne button, but somehow, somehow I'm just not sure it all comes together. My friend suggested the signature chicken kiev dish, and again it was pretty good. Succulent chicken, nice corn mash a lot of peas and probably better than at a Berni Inn. Probably. The service was very good and I'm told the bar is awesome. But as another reviewer said, it feels like a chain but it should feel like a destination. At these prices it needs to deliver more. I will probably come again (it's local) and as an eggs benedict connoisseur will update my review.",

    "text": "I hate to do this, especially as I had really high hopes for this place (apologies to everyone who's gotten really excited from reading the reviews directly below), but I had a really bad time here two nights ago. The staff, admittedly, were really friendly, but trivial mistakes like completely forgetting to bring us the wine we had ordered meant that we left with a fairly bad impression of them. (It was a relatively quiet night, so they should have had time to run to the fridge.) The restaurant's design is fun and it is suitably cosy on a chilly night, but does anyone else think that the green leather banquettes are reminiscent of the dodgy Aberdeen Angus restaurant down the road? Before you accuse me of pedantry, however, I should say that it's the food that I had the real problem with. Whilst their fish soup was decent, simple dishes such as scotch eggs and a burger were poorly done and simply not worth finishing. Given the other reviews on this site I feel that I've missed out on something spectacular, but I really wouldn't want to eat there again. Perhaps we ordered the wrong things, perhaps we went on a bad night, but we left the restaurant with the distinct feeling that this Bob wasn't worth ours.",
