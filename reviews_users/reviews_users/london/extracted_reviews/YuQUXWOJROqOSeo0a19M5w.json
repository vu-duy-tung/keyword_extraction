Do you remember those restaurants full of teenagers who had just left the drive-in cinema that featured in American 70s movies? Well, you've got one in the heart of London. Sticky Fingers, named after one of the Rolling Stones' album, is a rock'n'roll themed restaurant and the d\u00e9cor is there to prove it. I have nothing bad to say about this place. It's one my favorite spots.",

When we arrived we were told they were short staffed and would come to our table shortly. 15 minutes later, no drink, no starter, we werent even acknowledged. When we were sat down, originally we asked for a booth but suddenly a couple got it instead even though we were a four. So we end up cramped on this one table waiting to get out orders taken. This place looked like ramseys kitchen nightmare. The blonde waitress continued to ignore me, saying one minute I'm very busy. When we looked around we saw lots of tables, at least 8 who were waiting for food. There was one long table with about 12 people there who looked rather annoyed. I asked the lady when we would be served and she said sorry its just the two of us. After 30 minutes and no drinks or starters we left, I just couldn't believe they hadn't even bothered to take our order! We ended up going to Nandos where we had the best chicken but can't deny we would have really liked the steak at Sticky Fingers. Looks like there were no managers at this place, just two waitresses with no experience. Needs a serious shake up to be charging prices like this without any service.",

(If you want to see how one can screw up a hamburger, just go to Wendy's or a Burger King.) Other items I've gobbled up were fairly realistic fajitas and one I've never seen stateside: lamb burritos.

I personally think that 'Bodean's BBQ', 'Chicago Rib Shack' & 'The Big Easy' are better but as they were picking up the bill we went here instead.The starter of Nachos were decent - covered in a tasty cheese AND with a dipping bowl of Chili con queso.The Quesadilla was OK but not comparable to most Tex-Mex places as it lacked authenticity.I had the Bourbon Glazed Ribs and my buddy opted for the Hickory Smoked ones. The sauces were both very sweet and fairly similar. The meat was very tender and fell away from the bones easily. Sadly they may have been overcooked (pre-boiled) as the actual taste of Pork was lacking once the sauce had been licked off.The French Fries were done just right & the Mashed Potato was very rich in a buttery way. The \"Apple Coleslaw\" was too sweet to my liking.The \"Monday Madness\" offer means mains are discounted by 20-50% and some cocktails are 1/2 price too so it is definitely worth trying out on that particular day if you are unsure.",

    "text": "I've just come back from dinner at Sticky Fingers, so thought I'd better write the review while it's fresh in my memory.We turned up at 8pm and the place was just over half full, with a few people having drinks by the bar and watching some old footage of the Stones in concert on the flatscreen TV. We were seated promptly, and our waiter for the evening was very attentive but not obtrusive. Very good service, considering that eventually the place filled up by 8.30pm and was quite lively.We had the half rack of baby ribs to share as a starter, followed by the 12oz bone-in ribeye steak and Philly Cheese Steak as mains. We finished with the pecan brownie and ice cream to share. I also had a couple of cocktails (Lemon Tree and Twisted Mojito), while my friend had 2 glasses of prosecco. The Lemon Tree was nice and refreshing, but the alcohol presence wasn't very strong. The Twisted Mojito had more kick. My friend's first glass of prosecco was a bit flat, but the second glass had more fizz in it, probably from a newly opened bottle.The baby ribs were good. Not as meaty as Bodean's, but they were still soft and tasty. The bbq sauce was good, not overpowering and just the right quantity to cover the meat. It came with a small portion of coleslaw on the side, which had quite a strong tangy taste (I'm guessing from vinegar), so for those who don't like vinegar, be warned!The 12oz bone-in ribeye steak was really good. It came with a large portion of fries, half a tomato, a mushroom and some peppery water cress. I had mine done medium, and it came out nice and pink, with no oozing blood, just how I like it. As I cut the meat, I realised it was actually quite soft and tender. I then had my first bite and was pleasantly surprised as it was quite tasty. I then realised that it was partly because the steak had been seasoned with salt, which you don't get at Gaucho's. People may have different opinions, but I find both options equally palatable, and I definitely enjoyed the steak. Some mouthfuls were like eating taufu (it was that soft!). The fat on the steak at some places can be tough and chewy, but the fat on the steak I just had was velvety smooth and rich in flavour. Very easy to eat and didn't need any chewing at all.The Philly Cheese Steak was also very tender, although it wasn't completely smothered in cheese, so your doctor may be happy, but you might disagree if, like me, you like meat and cheese in huge quantities. We had a side order of chunky apple coleslaw, which was slightly misleading, as the apple wasn't in chunks, but in thin slices. As mentioned earlier, the coleslaw was quite tangy, so I couldn't really taste the apple in it.After letting the food settle in our stomachs, we then went for the pecan brownie with ice cream, and were very happy with our choice. We were served a large, dark brown, slightly moist, nutty brownie, topped with a hot chocolate sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The brownie was very rich and sweet, with enough nuts to give it some crunch. It's not as gooey as others I've had, but when you have ice cream to go with it, it's better to have a nutty brownie that is slightly \"cakey\", than one that resembles congealed mud (which I love equally!). Overall, I was very pleased with the food and the overall experience, which was more casual, comparable with TGIF or Bodean's, rather than somewhere a bit more upmarket like Gaucho's. I prefer Bodean's ribs, as they're meatier, but was pleasantly surprised by the steak and brownie, hence the 4 stars. I would definitely go back again, and would certainly recommend this place to those who like American style restaurants.",

I recommend the tableside camp fire sticky cookies, marshmallows and hot chocolate fondue for dipping.

Having said that, this would have been a 5-star review except for a couple of small things.Firstly, I ordered the rib/chicken combo. The ribs? DELICIOUS! I mean, amazing. So tender and fell right off the bone. The chicken? So-so. Kind of dry, not awful, not great. Especially after the amazing ribs. French fry side was okay. Fries were a bit underdone and a little cold, but that could be a result of not being served fresh at the table. Side of cole slaw was just okay as well, and tiny. I also got a side of grilled corn, which was very good, but needed some salt/pepper - a little under seasoned for me.Now, the little things. When someone gets delivery/take away of ribs, which are clearly meant to be eaten with the hands, napkins in the bag would be nice. Wet naps would be even better. Also, no cutlery was provided. Not a big deal for the ribs, kind of unfortunate for the chicken and cole slaw. I would absolutely dine here again - and may well do so before my trip ends - but I'll likely stick to the ribs.",

The drinks were all great and really good value for money, if you can make it during happy hours of 5.30-7.30 Sunday through Friday. My main was also good, but I thought it was a bit too big (to the extent it took away from the experience) and slightly bland in flavours. Perhaps, they could have upped the proportion of caramelised onions and such and reduced the size of the bun. Service was very good. The waiter was very helpful and prompt in bringing out everything we needed. Ambience was nice, but definitely more of an American rock and roll type of interior. Music wasn't too loud but loud enough that we couldn't hear each other sometimes.",

    "text": "Terrible, terrible, terrible.We went here for 4th of July, which was a Monday this year. So great, Sticky Fingers advertises half off mains on a Monday. Ah, but there's small print - 'up to'... I only noticed one thing that was actually half price, which was their most basic burger. The restaurant was all decked out in stars & stripes which was nice. We also saw online that if you wear a piece of striped clothing and a piece of starry clothing that you get a free sundae. Score. I wore a stripy top and my starry Converse - which hurt my feet but free ice cream.They had a little specials menu, which was 3 4th of July American burgers (none of which had any of the 'up to 50% off' and a \u00a35 mini sundae.The restaurant was impossibly loud; it was only a quarter full but we couldn't hear the server, or speak to each other without shouting. Even the waitress said it was ridiculous. So while I wanted the specials burgers, it was a matter of principle that I had to get something with a discount. So I ordered jalapeno poppers to share, and a bacon cheeseburger with onion rings.The jalapenos came out and are really awful. They weren't cooked enough and were impossibly hot, and the batter didn't taste of anything. It doesn't come with any sort of dip (I asked and they offered to bring me some mayo...) I didn't think there was a jalapeno popper made that I didn't like. Now I know better.So my burger comes out and it's tiny. It's about the thickness of a Five Guys patty and served well-done. For a \u00a314ish burger (about \u00a310 with the discount) it was paltry. The bacon was fatty and limp so I pulled that off. My onion rings tasted okay but weren't cooked. The taste of the actual burger was decent, with a nice crust on it, but it wasn't good overall. Throughout the service was non-existent. It's like we weren't even there.So finally they come to collect our plates and bring us the dessert menu. We had a look as we were both still hungry (we left most of our burgers) but nothing was exciting so decided to just get my free sundae. The waitress comes back and I say we don't want anything off the menu, but I'm wearing my stars and stripes so I believe I get a free sundae (and I proceed to draw her attention to my shoes). She nods and smiles and off she goes. Spoiler alert - the sundae never comes. After waiting there with nothing on the table for 15 minutes, we asked for the cheque. With the discount, for our poppers, 2 burgers, and 2 cokes the bill was \u00a335 - extortionate. But wait, \u00a35 of that is service charge! We left cash for the amount less the service charge and went home and ordered a pizza.tl;dr - Avoid. Overpriced poor version of Hard Rock.",

    "text": "So I thought I was doing a good thing. I'd been meaning to come here before I'd started writing a list for Yelp of the best American restaurants in London (later the UK and then Europe). I'd even enter competitions for vouchers in the idea that it'd finally give me the impetus to come.So the do a free Stars and Stripes promo for the 4th - you get a free sundae if you wear them. Read Nickie C's review for what happened there - in summary no sundae, and a waitress that may have thought we were nuts because my wife showed off her starry shoes.We arrive right on time, to a restaurant which is about a quarter full at 6pm. So where do we get seated in a restaurant which has one large table of 15 or so finishing and a table of two starting? Yep, directly between the two.Impossibly loud, the acoustics really carry on here. Couldn't really talk to each other over the noise from the other tables in a nearly empty restaurant. Half price mains had one main at half price. I went for a burger will pulled pork on top - that was I got to try the burgers and the barbecue in one hit, along with some sweet potato fries.She orders a portion of jalape\u00f1o poppers. They comprised of raw chilli cut open and stuffed with cream cheese in a light better. The chills weren't cleaned out of seeds, so we're incredibly spicy if their raw form.Burgers arrived. Good crust on the burger. Buns were so-so and tasted like a longlife bun. Pulled pork was a dark brown tasteless mush on top of the burger. I cut the thing in half, ate one half and then just the edges of the burger on the second half. Sweet potato fries were good - but I recognised then from other restaurants, they're a frozen type and not made in house.Then we had to try to get our plates cleared when we still had about 45% of the food left on there. That took a while. The the sundae fiasco. Then waited for fifteen minutes until the waitress came over and asked if we wanted anything else. Final insult was that our waitress blocked my wife in while she was trying to leave because she was busy pouring water for the table next to us.I'd been really looking forward to this and it was just awful.",

We went there for a lunch time special, and honestly, it could have been two courses instead of 3.Things that stood out for me included:- Nachos use proper nacho chips - They weren't stingy with the melted cheese, but the cheese sauce added a very American flavour- Ribs were sticky, but not dripping and messy - that nice consistent gooey coating- The ribs were tender without falling apart, easy to get off of the bone, but without that mushy 'crock pot' texture that some places resort to in order to keep demand going- The burger was available medium cooked. While that's sometimes scary, the meat looked like good quality ground beef with decent texture instead of a glued-together-pasteAtmosphere was a bit quiet, but it was lunchtime on a weekday, so that's to be expected. The decor is pretty much what you'd expect - Stones everywhere. But that's part of the attraction I guess, although I'm going back for the food, not the gold record on the wall!",

    "text": "Oh dear!Let us start at the beginning, we sat down at a little table right in the middle of the rapidly filling up restaurant. The waiter took our drinks order, I had been looking forward to trying some of the cocktails on their website menu (which has irritating music playing in the background...hello 1995), but was told rather curtly that these were no longer available as this was an old menu. The prices are higher on the new menu too...No matter, we had a couple of cocktails which weren't bad and asked the waiter to take our food order once we had finished. This was clearly a problem as we sat for at least 15 minutes after finishing, menus closed waiting for someone to come past. The waiter rushed past, I caught his eye and said 'Hi', he said 'Hi' then moved to clearing another table.Eventually he came back and took our order, with a clumsy up-sell asking us if we wanted large starters...why would we want large starters when there is a whole back of ribs to come, I digress.The starters arrived, one Southern fried wings, one BBQ wings. Both on the cusp of being cold, both slightly pink in the middle. Fair enough, this place is known for it's BBQ right, this is how it comes...ok, they weren't bad although the pink was a little worrying and the 'tobasco' southern fried chicken was really just battered chicken.While we waited and waited for our mains we heard the table behind sending back their food for being cold, in-fact while we were there several dishes went back to the kitchen untouched. Were these wrong orders? What are the waiters doing?The table behind got their replacement chicken...we still waited.Hooray! It arrived...uh oh, chicken was barely warm...again, this time it was going back. We broached this subject with the waiter, who's response was...and I quote \"how come?\", bemused we just looked at him, he said again, slightly more forcefully \"how come?\". Wtf? He then sighed and took it away to be reheated, at which point we definitely regretted coming here.My ribs were not so hot either, and really no better than Waitrose own brand. Not a patch in Bodeans or perhaps any other reputable BBQ place in London.After waiting for 15 minutes for the table to be cleared, that was enough! The ma\u00eetre d' clearly saw our pain and was good enough to remove the chicken and starters from our bill, which even then was not small.This place is the worst of TGI Fridays, meets the worst of Hard Rock Cafe.",

We always used to go for someone's birthday so we had a trip recently for my birthday even though it was actually not for another 3 weeks!This is an American style diner owned by Bill Wyman from the Rolling Stones with lots and lots of memorabilia on the walls. As a restaurant it is usually very busy so if you can book ahead do. The staff are usually very helpful but do seem to be rushing around a lot so if you are in a rush this is not the place for you.The menu has a lot of the usual things you would expect from a diner, burgers of various flavours, chicken, ribs and a few Veggie Options. This is an important factor for me so veggie options are Veggie Burger which is a pattie or assorted veg mushed together but cooked as well as it could be. They also have vegetable fajitas as an option which are apparently very onion heavy and then a couple of salads. I wasn't overly impressed but I was there for a burger and the burger was good so I got what I wanted. Fries were good too and you usually get a good portion with a bit of salad on the side too.Note for meat eaters: now I have it on good authority from another regular visitor to Sticky Fingers that they have now changed their cooking policy for meat and will not cook your burger rare or anything like rare. The closest you will get is Medium. No idea why and this will probably be a negative for some. They also have a bar with a huge selection of cocktails, and, although I haven't had one for a while, I remember the milkshakes being very yummy. Price wise you won't pay over the odds but things will be on the slightly more expensive side of things, but I have always had a great time whenever I have been to visit and I will no doubt return again - perhaps for another fake birthday!! xyz",

    "text": "Not being a lover of any kind of American fast food, some may wonder what in Harold Camping's name was I doing in this joint. Seeking rapture or a high gastronomical form of spirituality? Not at all. And, readers, it had nothing to do with the fact that I already knew it was a mixture of 'Planet Hollywood,' 'The Hard Rock Cafe' and 'Thank God It's Fridays.' I was taken by an American friend who wanted to prove to me, that to get good American food, you actually had to go outside the USA.While that statement lacked a certain logic to me, being a compliant type of gal, I humoured the fellow. It wasn't until I was inside that it was mentioned that Bill Wyman of 'Rolling Stones' fame was the owner. Just as well I was told that inside - and about to be served, as I've seen Bill on the Greek Isle of Myconos a little the worst for wear and I therefore presumed, unfairly, the grub might be the same.Shows one should never pre-judge anything. In desperate moments of borderline malnutrition - while working in many parts of the USA I confess to having eaten at places with the uncomfortable name of 'Fatburgers' and the beast of all beasts, 'Denny's.' Ignoring all the wonderful musical bric a brac memorabilia around the walls of 'Sticky Fingers' designed to influence the 'naive' and 'star struck' I can honestly say, with great reluctance, I thoroughly enjoyed every single bite of Wyman's offerings. Much like when the great man was on the stage performing, every bad feature of his personal life was forgotten and you enjoyed the moment.The 'Clouseau' 'amburger was delicious. I have never had better. Salads superb, and as for the smoked ribs, I say to my favourite old eating haunt in the San Fernando Valley, LA. 'Tony Roma's' You might never see me again, Buddy. You could never compete with 'Sticky Fingers.'I think the moderate prices that one finds at 'Sticky Fingers' are probably because Wyman saves on the silver. This is a joint where you can be as Neanderthal as you like - cutlery is optional - you may never touch it, which means, it never gets a chance to fall, 'by accident' into your purse.Well done, Bill. You tried the best of American food in the States. Given 'em the best on the stage - and just like your music, you've also outdone the buggers in the food department on your own home turf!",

Monday's are 40-50% off so we decided to try it. Overall the manager and staff were incredibly friendly and the atmosphere was nice as well, however the food was mediocre at best. My mom had the brisket and I had the Mac and cheese with a side salad. The brisket was good and definitely worth a try but that's probably the only thing worth trying it here since without the discount the prices were exceedingly high even for tourists who had come to expect London's high prices. The Mac and cheese wasn't bad as well but we've had better at other restaurants while on holiday. Lastly the side salad was probably the worst I've ever had, it was frozen and tasted like dirt. Overall the experience was mediocre but we've definitely had better while on our stay here in London and you can definitely find better places within this area.",
