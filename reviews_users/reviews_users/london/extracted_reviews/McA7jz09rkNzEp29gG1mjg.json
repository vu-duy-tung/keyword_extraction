Everything was nice and clean in a great location to Spitafields Market.DF/Mexico's food is great and they have a menu full of variety. I was tempted to choose the burger but I couldn't bring myself to do it... this time - maybe next.Amigos this American Southerner in London loves some good Mexican food and this place is worth a try so stop on by, y'all.",

    "text": "A new Mexican place near Bricklane. It is definitely a welcome addition to all the curry places. It is the sister restaurant Wahaca. The restaurant is quite casual, featuring communal tables and a self-serving ordering system. Upon arrive of the restaurant, you are led to a table that is marked. You then can go to the front and order your food on the two touch screens. You will get your drinks immediately and food will be brought to your table as it is ready. The whole process is very efficient and smooth and you no longer need to get the attention of your server to order or pay. I really like it. The menu features burritos, tacos and tortas and your variation includes chicken, beef, pork and seafood. The pricing is very reasonable. I ordered grilled stake burrito for lunch. The taste was decent, but the meat was under seasoned. What I do like is the all you can drink agua fresca. There are three flavors, and the lime and chia is very tasty. It is a good place to come for a quick lunch, but will not be my first choice for dinner.",

While I looked at the menu of course I had to order some tacos we ordered the pulled pork tacos and the chicken tacos, and a torta. The torta is not the traditional torta I have back home, but a brioche bun with slaw and pulled pork. It was all really delicious. The chicken tacos were not to my liking, I wasn't a fan of the pumpkin sauce I love spicy!! Everything else was really tasty. Like I said not traditional Mexican but very good food, and very tasty. Next time I will try the burrito! :)",

Abby got the make-your-own taco, I got the house pork burrito. Abby's dish was a little more interesting and flavorful but my burrito was so so satisfying, especially doused in the optional \"DF Hot Sauce\"--habanero with a hint of honey. The bottomless, self-serve soft drinks is a great, great feature that more London eateries should come around to. I loved the horchata but wished some cinnamon had been available in addition to the cinnamon already infused. All in all, a delightful meal. We will be back.",

My husband and I each had fish tacos; they were tasty and had a nice crunch on the fish. My daughter found her chicken tacos a bit too spicy, but really enjoyed her corn with cheese topping. She also loved the vegetarian nachos. I wish the order taker had discussed with us the amount of spice on my daughter's menu choice - it would've been nice if the person had offered to leave off the spicy sauce or at least mentioned it. Of course I should have asked myself - will be sure to do that next time.",

The seating is a mixture of booths and tables. Staff is friendly and attentive. You get seated and then you order your own food at the counter & staff will bring it to your table. They have tablets you can order from or a person at the till. If you opt for a bottomless drink- you can get yourself free refills in the center of the floor. I had the lime & chia aqua fresca and it was lovely. I then had the roasted vegetable burrito. It was good and had a lot of flavour in it. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was that they had some courgette in the burrito. Courgette's don't belong in mexican food. However- the flavour of the rest of the burrito was very good. I got the \"bad boy\" size which comes with a few chips and guacamole. If you add a side it's cheaper then if you buy one stand alone. I got the chili fries which were a good size portion. I then also shared a side of the DF slaw & cup of corn with my friend. Both sides had a lot of flavour. I liked the cheese crumbled in the corn. I also really liked the selection of hot sauces- especially the Valentina sauce. \u00a0All in all- a very filling meal at a good price with friendly service. We will return.",

I was stupid enough to try.) On my first visit I had the Fish Tacos, which are MSC certified, so you can enjoy your fried fish knowing that you're not harming the seas too much. The second time I had the Avocado Salad and although I first feared that it wouldn't fill me up, the bowl turned out to contain more yummy things than it seemed at first.Although it's self-service and you enter your order and pay on a computer at the bar, the staff is friendly and always ready to help out.",

    "text": "I hate leaving bad reviews but I am a real stickler for good service- which I did not see evidence of here. Don't get me wrong, the food is nice, nothing amazing. There's no salsa, the guacamole can't decide if it's half an avocado or liquid (with not much in between those two states), but flavours were \u00a0interesting and the chipotle mayo and ketchup were good.I came for a friends birthday, a large group of us. After we figured out the way the menu works (pick your choice, order at the counter) we got our orders in and waited. The frozen margaritas were nice, as was the bottomless softs drinks. I liked the self serve element of that.Birthday girl ordered a bunch of stuff for the table along with her food, and then we all individually. I ordered last, but my food came within 15 minutes, along with everyone else's but one others, shortly after.My friend had to go and enquire after her order, as only two of the three shared dishes came. There was a wait and then it appeared. 30 minutes later (45 minutes after ordering, and we'd all pretty much finished by then) she had to go up again and enquire after her meal and the other missing meal. The man working the pass to take the food out was very casual about it, with no apology for the wait, and after another 10 minutes or so, both had their meals. The server was not apologetic and couldn't understand that we were not happy. No apologies, no exposition. Just 'let me see you receipts', 'I'll go and check' and similar. She said that it was her birthday and perhaps he could make a gesture of something nice for the table, like some margeritas for us, and he said no, he can only do one, and then he disappeared. (Fyi the margeritas are made en mass and served from a soft ice cream machine. Easy to dispense. We had all ordered mains and drinks so had all spent at least \u00a315-20 each, so we weren't piss takers)He came back, put a margerita next to her and walked off, and kind of shouted 'happy birthday' over his shoulder when he was about 5 steps away, and still walking. The conversation was then pretty much about what a rude guy he was, and how the food wasn't authentic, that we would never come back. (I wasn't coming back anyway, but you know, nail in the coffin and all that).So... Come if you don't care about service and aren't fussed about authenticity. It's in a good location so that's appealing I suppose.",

    "text": "Right, Mexican food is an obsession and it was here that my obsession was totally fulfilled.The food is unreal and if you're in the capital looking for that vibe, this is well worth the trip.The surroundings are initially very cool, and it's smack bang in the middle of \"trendy\" brick lane and Truman Brewery. A really cool vibe with more than friendly staff. The menu is vast and plenty of options. Burritos, tacos are obvious but they've got some excellent options and burgers if you fancy something else.Kicking things off with some traditional Mexican beers and Guack, it was obvious we were on to something. The dip was perfect and certainly made fresh for that night. As there was two of us we spilt some fish tacos and a pork burrito, a pretty good idea to try as much of the menu as you can. The burrito was stuffed to the bring and the flavours were amazing. Good sense of coriander running throughout, which for me is key in this type of cuisine. The fish tacos were just as good and unlike other places, a really good portion. Two huge battered fish fillets lay on top of shredded salad and spices. I could of easily powered through 10. They've got a really nice selection of sauces and condiments to accompany the meal too. We delved into the hot sauce \"valentinas\" I think and the habenro mix. Both great of the huge side of chips they provide. To nail the whole meal we also added a side of slaw, a perfect mix or red cabbage with a slight kick from chilli flakes, not too creamy too which I hate coleslaw to be!We both were in awe before, during and after the meal. The food disappeared off the plate and we did even mull over an extra order of tacos. Seen a few reviews slating the ordering system (you order at the counter) I think it works well, seems quicker and gets you up to discover the fresh drinks on ice and condiments they have to offer. Plus you get your beer quicker. Also just as a note, we rolled in here about 8pm on a Friday and walked into a table. Given where it is and how busy the area is we thought we'd be up against a long Q or wait. Pleasantly surprised. Obviously another reason to go!The makers of Wahaca are on to an absolute gem here and arguably my favourite Mexican spot in the capital. Plans are already set to get back here this weekend and I suggest you do the same...TACOS!!!!!",

    "text": "This place is really special because it's not just the regular \"tex-mex\" type Mexican food; instead it serves really interesting flavours with an authentic base. Being from Los Angeles and studying in the UK for a year really made me miss having an abundance of this cuisine. This was actually my last meal in London before heading back to the States and I am so pleased I decided to try here. Whenever I eat Mexican food I always want a burrito. I thought my steak burrito was excellent, the meat was cooked to a nice medium-medium rare although the meat to rice ratio was a bit off. Again, there were some very interesting flavours going on that I would never thought would be good but surprisingly elevated the burrito to a whole new level. I just wish I had a bigger portion of corn chips on the side. I got a huge heap of guac which was nice but not too many chips to dip into it. We also tried the DIY Mexican boards which come with soft tortillas, slaw, corn chips, the unique chipotle hibiscus salsa, guac and you get to choose the meat. This is the best menu option for those who are hungry! Our meals were the star, but I think the drinks deserve some credit too. The hibiscus agua fresca is incredibly refreshing. I also tried the lime and chia, which was good, and the horchata which was perfect! I make horchata for myself every so often and theirs is spot on. Would definitely recommend trying at least one of these out, they are bottom-less after all!Staff are super friendly, great vibe, cool set-up and design. Highly HIGHLY recommend this place if you're in the mood for Mexican.",

(though \u00a310 for mushrooms is tit steep guys.. \u00a310 gets you a whole farm of mushrooms in Mexico, just sayin') oh the fish taco was also equally delicious and not over fried. topped with mayo. dapper standards. they've definitely done their research on this urban outfitters-esque tex mex restaurant. they also serve tortas aka burgers and chili chips. good for groups and takeaways. get drunk on frozen margsssssss!",

    "text": "The place is just right for the location on the side of the Truman Brewery right off Brick Lane and they've made good use of the industrial space with a decor to match.They show you to a table (or seats at the window bar in our case) and give you a table number. After deciding what you want on the menu you go up to the counter and place the order yourself on the touchscreen and pay directly by card. I do like this. It's efficient, less risk of incorrect order and no waiting around for someone to come over to your table. Just go, tap it in and done, and paid for too. Seems to me this is a way to go for more place in the future.The menu is well designed and has some appealing sounding options. Casual, no nonsense Mexican themed stuff.Food came pretty quickly since it seems to be designed to be production line friendly. I got the carne con chili DIY Mexican board which turns out to be some soft tortillas (home made and good but would prefer if they increase the count by one more), a mini pan of succulent beef chili and beans which was well made with good depth of flavour, topped with cheese and some sour cream. A small side of red cabbage slaw which complemented the beef well and a few tortilla chips and guacamole. The tortilla chips were freshly made and the guac was also good and chunky and fresh tasting. Chipotle salsa was nice and smoky / spicy. My dining partner's choice of chili rub steak with fries was reported to be not as good. Steak was average and the 'fries' were exactly the kind that what would be called 'chips' at a Motorway Service station on the M1, straight from the industrial freezer bag except you would get more of them on the M1. The tiny stack of completely wilted unidentified green leaves on the side didn't help either.So slightly mixed but overall a good experience from my side and came to just over \u00a320 (drinks excluded) plus when we had finished there was no waiting to try and get the bill, we just upped and went. A good addition to the growing London Mexican food scene.",

The first time we ate there I left really happy and excited about it but having been there a few times now my feelings have waned. (Much like a deceivingly good first date the first impressions were great but once the shine wears off you're disappointed!) It isn't that there's anything bad about it per se so much as there isn't anything that great? The food is reasonably priced and is just typical wahaca fare. We've had the burritos, the tacos, the nachos and all of the sides. The sweetcorn I was originally in love with as anything with feta is good in my book but it really is a russian roulette as to whether you get cheesy goodness or a watery mess that looks less than appealing. The only thing I can say that I love here is the hibiscus water and the desserts. Everything else is just okay. However, it is nice to have a place that serves burritos which is quite spacious.The general decor and layout of the restaurant is really nice. Alright on the whole but nothing to write home about.",

The service was extremely quick, and the quality of the food seemed very high. They also had a strange selection of drinks which was really interesting. We had some nachos to start, and the guacamole was exceptional. I then had a pull-pork-type burger with some spicy chips. The chips were a little too spicy for me, but not uncomfortable, it just took some of the other flavours away. While the food was good, I thought the price was pretty average. I would go again, but I wouldn't race back to try their food. I'd probably choose a Wahaca instead.",

Hence we have less fresh vegetables and more hot heavy flavors, less coriander and more black beans!And the result is awesome!I dislike their way of serving, you have to go the counter for ordering, pay before and then you receive your food on the table. This is just slow and complex, you basically queue up in the middle of the restaurant and stay there while people next to you is eating... Just plain stupid. But then the food came, and everything was so fulfilled with flavors, nicely blent together and rich. Awesome!I went with a group so we had the opportunity to try everything, burrito, boards, tacos and everything was excellent but the fish tacos, which was a bit uninspired. My suggestion is to go for the meat, burritos boards and burgers!!Drinks are really nice, if you go for the soft drinks you'll get the possibility to try all three flavors, in particular the lemonade (made with lime, I don't remember its name) was fantastic for finishing the meal. The only missing thing, they should leave some cinnamon for the horchada, it's a kind of a rookie mistake not leaving it there next to lime and ice.Try also margarita and the ice cream, the first one, fresh frozen and with a good alcool slap, the second one made with a very good quality of vanilla, perfect finish for the meal!In conclusion, awesome place. Good, cheap, and with \u00a0interesting flavors. Just that service thing and a couple of minor issues make the rating turning down one point!",

I was so happy! I was told the margaritas were good too!Food-wise, we went for the make your own burrito with steak and cheesy onion goodness, spicy beef nachos, which were phenomenally amazing and tender beef corn tacos which were messy but nothing cutlery doesn't solve, full of crunchy cabbage which goes well with hot meat and beans in a different way to the usual piles of lettuce at Wahaca. Someone's definitely thought it through! Big shout out to the tasty beans and crunchy chips too!Service was speedy, could have done with an extra smile, I understand its a fast food concept but seeing how good the food was, a touch better face to face interaction would be nice. Overall, I was impressed, really tasty food, better than expected on all flavour levels, only complaints? Freezing toilets and increase the size of the frozen margaritas; they come from a cool machine and the fruit pur\u00e9e is added, perhaps they could be stirred by staff rather than customer?Can't wait to return.",

Beef tacos. \u00a0Again great flavor. \u00a0Just a little too saucy. \u00a0Dial back the sauce a bit and make them a touch less wet and you're golden. 3. Chicken. \u00a0Great! \u00a0Chicken could be a little more tender and less dry but these were solid. Fish ones are brilliant! \u00a0Would be amazing to offer a grilled version for those gluten free / celiac folks The sides were brilliant. \u00a0Rice was awesome. Corn dish was amazing (a little too much onion but great flavor with the cheese). \u00a0Beans were also very good. \u00a0Salsas were also great. \u00a0Would love the option of some pico de gallo at the salsa bar. \u00a0All in all great. \u00a0Also the decor is perfect. \u00a0Got a good vibe and reminded me of LA and Austin. \u00a0Well done. \u00a0Will be back.",

    "text": "Came here for an impromptu dinner because the menu looked good and the prices were cheap. It was pretty busy at 7 pm on a Friday night but I was still seated right away. Once you get your table, you head up to a counter and place your order and pay. If you get a drink (soda or water) there is a fountain with cups next to it, help yourself after paying to as much as you want. The server will bring your food out to you when it's ready. I got the cheese fries and Chile beef tacos (an order comes with two). The fries were seriously lacking in cheese sauce--they were okay, but I want my fries drenched in that stuff! They were nice and crispy, though. The tacos were decent. I was expecting way more of a kick, given the name \"Chile beef,\" but to be honest they were kind of flavorless. The most flavor came from the small amount of guac on top. They weren't the worst tacos I've ever had, but they definitely could have used way more seasoning. I like the ordering system. It actually made it much more convenient to eat and leave without having to wait for a check. The staff was also really friendly. This is a pretty good place for a cheap meal, but if you're looking for something more authentically Mexican this may not satisfy.",

    "text": "Honestly pretty decent tacos. I'm a bit surprised by the extremely negative reviews for this place. Granted, I have found Mexican food to be a bit lacking in the UK as well, but the tacos at DF/Mexico are pretty close to some of the better taco joints I remember from back home. Although I'm from Canada so maybe I don't know what I'm talking about either...Anyway, we tried the grilled steak, msc fish, and buttermilk chicken tacos. The fish tacos were my favorite, super flavourful with the right amount of crispness. Buttermilk chicken was a close second. Grilled steak was my least favorite, but still pretty tasty in my opinion. I'd be interested in trying the pork pibil in the future.Service was friendly as well. Will probably return to DF/Mexico if I'm craving tacos in London again!",

We stopped in for an afternoon snack while walking through Brick Lane Market and fortunately we only ordered one portion of the tacos (2 tacos per portion) between two of us. The tacos are huge! The battered cod taco with chipotle crema was fantastic - nice crunch to the batter and succulent white fish meat that falls apart in the mouth. We also ordered the guacamole with tortilla chips - the guac itself was great but the tortillas were a tad stale. To wash it all down we had a classic margarita and a passion fruit margarita. Frozen margaritas aren't usually my thing but these were strong and not too sweet. We didn't try any of the larger meals but would definitely stop by again for an afternoon taco fix.",

This is the place.I got seated without any issues even though the place was relatively busy. I have to say I absolutely love the ordering process - you simply choose what you want from the menu, then type it into the computer.I got the Chili con carne board, and it was absolutely delicious. I also love the bottomless soft drinks.Really impressed with this new restaurant. I later found out when I looked it up online, that it is a sister restaurant from the people who brought us Wahaca, so it was bound to be good, although DF/Mexico has a totally different feel to it.Looking forward to a return trip!",
