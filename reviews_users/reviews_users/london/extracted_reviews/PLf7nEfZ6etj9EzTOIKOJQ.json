    "text": "Almost a real US-style burrito and frozen margarita! (I'm from Texas and California, so can claim some knowledge) Definitely the best I've had in London. This is the fast-food folks in the south-western US have come to love. Luckily, it seems a lot healthier than a kebab or chicken and chips. If you're not familar with Mexican food: this is just like a cafe, where they assemble a sandwich in front of you, as you choose your ingredients. Typically a burrito has: (CA-style) rice, beans, meat, salsa with optional cheese, sour cream, guac. (TX-style) meat, salsa, cheese, sour cream, guac with optional beans & rice. They've got several choices for rice, beans, meat, & salsa. They wrap the burrito in tinfoil to keep it all together while you eat it with your hands. You slowly unwrap a little bit at a time as you nosh your way town the yummy tube of goodness. The medium costs 4.5 quid and will fill you right up. Now you don't have to get a burrito if you're looking for a lighter meal. Instead you can get the burrito in a bowl, or burrito fixings atop a salad, or soft tacos. It's all the same ingredients arranged in different ways. That's the beauty of California fast-food Mexican dining. There are a few large tables available for stopping at and eating. You'd be surprised just how quickly you can finish a burrito. They have a good selection of Mexican beers (Dos Equis, Pacifco, Negro Modelo) and the Texan favorite, frozen lime margaritas. You have to pay extra for tortilla chips, which is unusual, but typical of Chipotle the US chain that this shop seems based upon. I didn't try them this time, since I wanted to actually finish my burrito, something I never accomplish in California. This restaurant is great if: you're really hungry and you want to eat now, you're looking for healthy/different fastfood options, you're hankering for Mexican food, or you don't have a lot of money. At 9pm on a Tuesday it seemed to be quite popular with the post-gym ladies and gentlemen.",

The carnita naked burrito I had yesterday was rather bland, to be honest, and when I added hot sauce, the sauce was more salty than spicy. I'm pretty sure I've had better in London, though nothing springs to mind somehow. Maybe Luardo's? Service is average at best. My server yesterday had a rather strong accent and didn't speak all that loudly, so I couldn't understand anything she was saying, and had to ask her to repeat herself a number of times. She seemed to get irritated by that, and, in all honesty, I don't usually have a problem with most accents, so I'm just sayin' I don't think the problem lay entirely with me. I do like that drinks are refillable, but the coke was very heavily watered down!",

    "text": "hungryinlondon.com/2011/\u2026(for pictures and more) Recently I was invited to check out the Mexican fast food place Tortilla. Tortilla is a mini chain consisting of 5 branches in London and claims to serve healthy Mexican burritos. Tortilla clearly had no idea who they asked to scrutinize their restaurant as, to be honest, Mexican food is one of my least favourite cuisines. I really struggled when I was in Mexico to find anything I enjoyed eating. Having said this, I love Mexican ceviche, but in general there are just too many beans and cornmeal-based dishes and after a few days everything just started tasting the same. As far I have been successfully ignoring the current food trend of Mexican restaurants popping up all over London But of course I am willing to give everything a chance. I went to the Islington branch of Tortilla and my first impression was good. Wooden communal tables, clean layout, bright (maybe too bright) lighting, a nice mixture of people and big bottles of chili sauce on the table (have I mentioned that I am a chili addict?). You order your selection of burrito filling at the counter and your personalised burrito is prepared freshly. You have a choice of chicken, pork, beef or vegetarian, 2 different kinds of rice and 2 different kinds of beans. The burrito is finalised by putting on some chili sauce (mild/medium/spicy) and/or guacamole (+0.70) before being wrapped into a neat parcel. The damage for a medium sized tortilla (which is in fact huge!) is 4.95 and for a large one 5.95. Here it is, my nicely wrapped burrito to take away or eat in. My burrito contained grilled chicken, lime cilantro rice, black beans and hot salsa roja. To my big surprise I really liked it and even though I am not sure 'healthy' is the right word to describe it, it doesn't feel as if you were doing any major damage your body eating it. Tortilla hasn't quite changed my opinion about Mexican cuisine in general, but as far as fast food goes, it is a great option. I might even be back",

The food didn't taste particularly good either - for a start the burrito was filled too full so it unwrapped immediately and I had to eat it with a knife and fork, and the fillings just seemed very plain. I was impressed with the US style free drinks refills, but they didn't even try to hide the fact that their coke was heavily watered down.

I have tried Mexican food in ample places in London and all over Europe for that matter and most of then simply don't taste good, in fact they taste bad.. just like the lack of decent Thai food in London!BUT when I walked into Tortilla and saw the pictures of amazing Mexican places in San Francisco such as Pancho Villa I not only wanted to cry, cuz I lived just around the block from there, but I also had hope! And in fact the burritos are quite good (for London standards, but I will never get a California burrito here) and they even serve micro-brewed San Francisco beer Blue Moon! Also, I am a pescetarian and their veggie burritos and guacamole are yummy! I love re-friend beans and Tortilla's don't come with beacon as the re-fried beans from Chipotle. I only wish that it would have fish tacos, but none of the places I have tried in London have them, so I guess its just a bit too much to ask!I am taking two points off because I think the prices could be a bit lower and to go to the bathrooms, you have to walk through the kitchen which I think is a bit weird, but I guess better than no bathroom! And it is pretty good Mexican food but FOR London. In San Francisco I would not go to this place twice.",

However, some of the worst meals vie paid for thus far in London have been Mexican, and this was not one fo them. In London, when the burrito craving hits, this will do the trick. And I didn't try the guacamole, but it was the most authentic, best looking guacamole I've seen thus far in London. It was chunky and vibrant green, so they didn't water it down with soured cream like I've frequently seen here in the UK. I will def try that next time.The chicken meat is nice and salty and flavorful, not Cancun, but will do.",

Because this was not as good as its neighbour Chilango. Admittedly I am a vegetarian so stop reading now if you are looking for a 'dirty' meat burrito. Their burritos are smaller than Chilango for the same price and the veg option was mostly just grilled onion. I hate onion but will tolerate it in a burrito because it is usually surrounded by goodness. There was no guac and cheesey goodness, only oniony badness. I kept waiting to hit that area of tasty burrito heaven hidden inside and it never arrived. Not a fan. I'll stick to Chilango, thanks. I do prefer the seating and decor though, feels less like a fast food joint and somewhere you can chill.",

Due to it being the veggie option I got a free dollop of guacamole, and left out the sour cream and cheese (cry) because they're not vegan friendly...

And since the event, I've kind of made Tortilla my default-Mexican food stop when my craving gets too strong.My tip: when you get a steak or pork burrito - ask them to NOT squeeze out the juice. I find that a juicy (well-lubricated) burrito is much tastier. Also, do invest in extra-guacamole, as this will uplift the flavour tremendously. (They are a little stingy on the guacamole though.)",

Thank you.You can't compare Tortilla's burritos to authentic greasy-spoon-taqueria burritos...you have to go to Cali for that. But it's as close as you can get in the land of tea and crumpets!",

    "text": "Terrible burritos from Tortilla strikes again!Let me clarify firstly that there is nothing CALIFORNIA about this chain other than the name in the title.I've met these owners, i know they're from Northern California, and myself coming from Santa Barbara, I get that they want to be 'authentic'. Charming. Its totally been watered down to meet the british palates. Don't get me wrong, there's tons of great and flavourful food that Britain makes, but lets be real, Mexican food is not one of them. And Tortilla has stepped off of its California flavour profile to deliver less than flavourful food in a health conscience backdrop. Kudos for being healthy, but honestly if I wanted raw peppers in my burrito i would get a salad instead. There was little meat in my burrito and though the paler beans were ok, they weren't stellar. There was so much rice and so little meat it was really astounding as to the ratio, maybe that was first night opening faux pas, and the peppers & onions were close to being raw. which wasn't nice. It would've been nicer had they been sauteed.The large size was good. Now thats the part where california could put a stamp of approval on. Overall: You continue to disappoint me. #sorrynotsorry",

    "text": "Pretty mediocre, but the prices are fair and they really cram all the \"stuff\" in there.While assembling, she really piled on the meat - I had the barbecoa beef - which when rolled up, became a thick core of juicy cow straight down the center. Some bites were full-on pulled beef and nothing else. I want to say this was too much, and I even had some of almost everything else (rice, grilled veggies, beans, salsa, sour cream, jalapenos, squeeze of lime) but they got drowned in the salty abundance of beef. At the same time, when it comes to the meat, most places will err on the side of stingy, so its hard to really gripe about it.I tend to think that when you're eating a burrito a large part of experience is the simple glory of eating something so solid and filling. So on that point, they win.",

    "text": "So just before a trip to the theatre, me and a friend popped in here for a quick dinner. Great place to go if you only have 15 mins to eat, since friendly and quick service is a given. And burrito is super filling, so no rumbling stomachs throughout the performance. Win!We grabbed a couple of spots to sit in, not easy since there isn't much seating here. Burritos all round, I went for large since I was starving and basically inhaled it, but a good portion size and well bulked out with rice and beans. You get a pretty good choice here and at 6 quid for a large burrito I think it good value for money.Only 3 stars since it don't taste of very much to be honest. They ask you about a variety of options to add - salsa, sour cream, different rices, different sauces. But I couldn't taste the tomato in my rice, the medium spice in my sauce or the cheese. It was mainly salty pulled pork (which did fill a hole) and the black beans. All in all, I've had a better burrito, but for convenience and price you can't really complain :)",

    "text": "Having spent the last few years bouncing back and forth between Los Angeles, Mexican Mecca, and Colorado, birthplace of Chipotle Mexican Grill, I've grown pretty critical of San Francisco-style burrito joints. However, this judgement has been curtailed in London primarily due to the fact that the city is almost completely devoid of the giant, affordable burritos that are commonplace back in the states. This being the case, I was excited to give Tortilla a shot. Location-wise Tortilla is great. The area surrounding Angel Tube Stop is full of both shopping and dining gems, and the establishment is mere meters from the tube entrance/exit. From there, it's pretty much impossible to write up a review of Tortilla without constant comparisons to Chipotle Mexican Grill, so I won't even try.The food is good and authentic in terms of what a San Francisco-style burrito looks like in the states, but the size of the burritos and the quality and taste of the ingredients really do fall short of what Chipotle can offer. \u00a0Granted, for 5 GBP, it's hard to complain, but if you're looking for good American-style Burrito, just stick with Chipotle Mexican Grill.",

A LOT - and a few days after eating here, i found myself craving what i'd eaten again!! i know this isn't *real* mexican, but the meat was tender and juicy, the tortillas were nice and seemed fresh, and i liked the guacamole as well. plus this place is close enough to my flat to become my regular place!! i tried chilango after coming here, and i think this place is seriously better.. the pork tacos were niiiicee, and i'm craving them again now which MEANS SOMETHING you know? \u00a0one awkward thing - when they were putting the guacamole on my tacos, they tried to charge me the extra pound twice, like per each taco because he put a lot on.. and i had to be like um no. take some off then, i'm not paying two pounds.. whatez all good in the end though!!",
