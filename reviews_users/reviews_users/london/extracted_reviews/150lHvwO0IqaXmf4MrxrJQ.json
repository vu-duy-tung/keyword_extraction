    "text": "I joined in on Yelp's most recent Ramen Club outing to Dozo after being invited by YGO. I love ramen - in moderation - and haven't eaten it in a while, so this seemed to be an ideal time to get back on the wagon and make my first UYE debut.But I digress. My plus one and I were the first arrivals on that day and were greeted by a rather anxious waiter who wasn't sure if our group would fit in the table they'd set aside for us. As it turned out, and as more people arrived, that was indeed the case, and we were ushered upstairs into a much longer table without too much fuss. However, having had the pleasure of sitting on the ground floor, I definitely second YGO's comment: Ladies, do not wear mini-skirts or short dresses if going to Dozo.I wasn't too hungry so I just opted for a chawanmushi (Japanese steamed egg with meat) along with a house tonkotsu ramen. I was ecstatic to see the chawanmushi on the menu. It's one of my favourite Japanese dishes, but it's been very hard to find in London for reasons unknown to me. It didn't disappoint.Onto the ramen. In a word, delicious. It just about tied for best ramen I've had in London. And if Dozo are consistent, then it'll take the no. 1 spot upon my repeat visit, that's for sure. I really loved the melt-in-my-mouth pork slices, and the broth was nice and flavourful.The service was friendly if slightly frazzled by our large group. I had to ask for my drinks order several times, but that was pretty much the only hiccup of the night. Thanks again to YGO for organising this!",

(ooh how posh!) but so hard to move around because it's got that traditional 'hole dug under the table thing going, which I actually feel really bad for the waiters, when it comes to cleaning under the tables.But they are really attentive, which is a novelty for SOHO. Also, if you have a weak bladder like I do, Sit on the outside, getting out of that place is a effort and a half. (Yeah. I just told the world I had a weak bladder, what are you going to do!?)Luckily, I'm not one to drop super pricey sashimi on the floor, I might cry. The food was lovely though, we ordered a few long big makis and starters to get us going, and everyone has ramen which was nice, but i dunno, ramen in london is competitive and by no means was it the best but it was nice, the noodles could be springier and the soup a little bit more depth. But I realise that sushi is their strong point and not ramen so come here for good sushi and sashimi, but also be willing to pay the price. So I'm also guessing the owner and wait staff arent all from Japan, but I have no qualms about this, if you do, maybe consider that London is SO multicutural, yeah?",

Yee Gan had booked us in as a group of 16, which I think was a bit of a shock to the management. But they recovered quickly and served delicious noodles and sushi. As I'm not a fan of fish I just say: the sushi looked amazing and no one complained. I guess that sums it up nicely. I decided to go with the spicy ramen, which had a great flavour. But everyone else had decided on the more traditional soups and was then asking the staff \u00a0for chilli oil and chilli spice, which was provided without any problems. What a great discovery by Yee Gan and thanks for sharing.",

Go to Dozo!!!Far nicer in appearance than its asian cuisine neighbors, Dozo pleases with pure, unadulterated, slightly erotic, nearly orgasmically good Japanese food. Yes it's also more expensive than a few others on the street but holy sh*t is this place worth every penny. They dont try to over-innovate already good dishes using time tested recipes. They only offer the best quality ingredients to go with straight forward meals. They do try a Michelin-star approach to food presentation; for the romantics in the room. And they do have very attentive service staff to keep the sake flowing. Speaking of Sake, they didnt have the biggest selection, but what they did have was divine. I have a slight addiction to Uni, so much so my friends were laughing at how I nearly passed out in pleasure after taking my first Uni bite in nearly 4 years! In general Uni is a delicacy and not offered at all Japanese restaurants. Dozo not only offers but selects the freshest urchins (from who knows where) and presents them in certainly the most elaborately beautiful dish in the restaurant. Not cheap either. For fun we did the math and was stunned to realize we were paying \u00a36.5 per bite of Uni! Due to my 'affliction' I didnt care one bit and had 4 more. In the end my friends and I ordered half the menu that night and left thoroughly satisfied in food-coma. Bottom line is GO HERE!",

Slow services : We placed the 1st order and then had to waited for more than 30 mins to get served the salad, and another 20 mins for the main dishes, let alone the waiter forgetting one of our drinks, only to be reminded by us 15 mins later. After having finishes our food, we decided to order one more dish and it took yet another 30 mins for it to be on our table.3. Despite that, staff are still very friendly though. They were also very kind to let us know about the 10% discount if we had paid with cash instead of card. So we did save a bit thanks to that3. Food quality: I'd say it's good, or rather acceptable. We had salmon skin salad, volcano rolls, beef wagyu rolls, spider rolls and seared tuna rolls. And I must say that only the volcano rolls impressed me. The others were kind of tasty-ish, didn't give me any \"wow\" that I had expected, especially concerning the prices. So I would give this one a passAnd yes, I know of other places where these rolls are better and less pricey.",

The rice was flavorful, the rolls were very well rolled and pretty, and the fish and avocado were both fresh and tasty - the flavors really stood out. Bit sad we didn't try more sushi, as this was an auspicious way to start. My main dish was the seafood ramen. It was very filling and hearty, and the ramen was delicious - just the right level of chewy and flavorful. Loads of seafood, though I did get one of those ambiguous-seafood pieces with the pink swirl. Otherwise, plenty of prawns (tail on), scallops and fish. There was half of a well-cooked tea-stained egg, just the right amount of soft yellow in the very center. Really good dish!Good service, delicious food. The tables seemed novel, but they're tough to climb in and out of. Will definitely be back!",

We arrived at 6:15 p.m. (they supposedly opened at 6:00 p.m.) and the place was packed (a good sign) but the noise and chaos of the restaurant overpowered the entire restaurant. The ma\u00eetre d was quite flirtatious with us, so he \"found us a table\" or rather squeezed us into the end of a row of tables, requiring us to sit on the floor with our legs dangling into a black hole in the floor, no I am not joking. We were packed elbow to elbow and shoulder to shoulder, and foot to foot with the crowds. It was not a pleasant dining experience.The food however, made up for the cramped quarters. The vegetable gyoza were perfectly prepared with a flavorful and tangy dipping sauce. The Kaiso salad, a mix of seaweeds, was utterly flat and flavorless and sat in a pool of water. Their sesame dressing, served on the side, was more of a thick peanut butter than a sauce. It was the disappointment of the meal.The sushi, consisting of a tempura asparagus roll, a rainbow roll, and a tuna roll were fresh and delicious. There are some basic vegetarian rolls on the menu, but other than five types of rolls and a couple of salads, there is nothing on the menu that doesn't consist of some form of meat, fish, or seafood.If you're looking for a Japanese restaurant in Soho, this is an option but just beware that it will be noisy, and crowded.

    "text": "After some disappointments at recent Yelp ramen Club outings, I may just have unearthed a gem for our next ramen club eventI spotted Dozo when wandering round Soho recently. I was in the mood for some warming ramen and in amongst the comprehensive Japanese menu, I spotted a ramen section offering tonkotsu and tantanmen ramen amongst other offerings. The way they wrote the descriptions gave me a strong sense that they were aiming for authenticity in their product, so in I poppedThe interior is nicely decorated though the seating may not be as practical as it's pretty. Tables have raised platforms around them, making it look traditional Japanese tatami place settings but with holes for you to put your legs into. Women with short skirts, beware as it will be hard to get into the table space elegantly!I opted for my favourite tonkotsu ramen, looking forward to a rich, complex broth reflecting hours of long boiling of pork bones to obtain that fatty goodness. I also augmented my meal with a side order of o-toro nigiriOn arrival, the ramen looked very promising with dense milky broth and it didn't disappoint! Heavenly goodness with every mouthful Moist, succulent cha shu pork and appropriately just runny-yolked nitamago egg proved yummy companions to the fresh noodles. It brought a smile to my faceHowever, the star of the meal was yet to come. After being spoilt with some superb o-toro on holiday in the USA, I have found it difficult to find similar quality o-toro in the UK. Well, the version here at Dozo proved to the best in the UK. It had just arrived fresh that morning and was sweet and melt in the mouth tenderI am looking forward to bringing the Yelp Ramen Club here to break our recent poor run. Just have to remind the ladies not to wear short skirts!",

    "text": "Since moving to London, I have been searching for something to replace the amazing ramen scene of Vancouver, BC. A friend recommended Dozo, so we made a special trip into Soho on a rainy day. I was hoping this place would be the answer to my tonkotsu prayers, but it was FAR from it. We were seated immediately on the main floor, which was cold and draft due to the proximity to the door. We both ordered the Tonkotsu ramen, which arrived in under 10 minutes. I have to say, the dish was such a disappointment. The presentation was blah, with the soups contents hastily shoved into the broth rather than neatly arranged, but broth itself was the perfect colour - milky and cloudy. So much potential! Sadly, it tasted far from perfect. The broth completely lacked flavour, and had no hint of the typical depth of tonkotsu. In all honesty, it tasted like under seasoned water. The three pieces of chashu were cold, dry, and chewy. The nitamago was perfectly soft boiled but just tasted like a boring soft boiled egg, as if it hadn't been marinated at all. The noodles themselves were mushy and had no firmness whatsoever. And perhaps the strangest part for me was the inclusion of spinach - in an already bland bowl of soup, boiled spinach really didn't add anything. I'm going with two stars because the service was fine and the green tea was regularly refilled. But after paying about \u00a325 for two people with a 'recommended' 12% service charge thrown on top for a sub-par meal, I'm still searching for my perfect ramen fix.",

Unfortunately to eat a great sushi in London can be costly, but not anymore. Today, after a very long wait I finally manage to dine in Dozo, never booked a table and had to wait, today I tackled it by being at the door before 6 pm.We ordered 3 roles of sushi and two rise dishes!The roles are 6-8 pieces, we had the class and favourite salmon skin, spice tuna and salmon and avocado.Was great..... The food is so fresh, you can taste each ingredient individually and together which makes it irresistible. The rice bowls were big and delicious,The first one is for sashimi fans, fresh cuts of around 8-10 different types of fish. A must have is the slow cocked beef with egg, mushroom and onions melt in your mouth.I never gives 5 stars, but Dozo is definitely worth it.I know I'll be back here again for their amazing sushi.Cheers and enjoy the food:)",

    "text": "A lovely authentic Japanese establishment... Beautiful decor and a pleasant dining experience. As I'm a regular here I try to try a new dish each time alongside my usual favourites. Firstly, a few good things to know:Book early or in advance as they become extremely busy in the evening. There are two types of seating, tables that are embedded in the ground that you have to swing your legs down into or a usual table at normal dining level. If you have trouble getting up or moving freely the latter is the best option for you. There are tables upstairs and downstairs (ground level) but if you choose upstairs the toilets are down in the basement (lower ground) so be aware. The food is simply outatanding. It is fresh, always hot if you go for a cooked option and the taste is consistent. I usually go for the scampi tempura, soft shell crab maki (8 pieces) and pork belly butu (2 skewer sticks). Then if I'm feeling greedy, go for a beef ramen or a rice dish. The drinks are reasonable price and they have a full bar. An excellent choice is their plum wine which is presented in a pivotal glass with a Chinese plum and ice. The execution of the dishes are efficient and soya sauce, fish sauce, chilli sauce is provide at the table. The table is dressed simply and the crockery is traditional Japanese. It is a average to loud establishment so not somewhere to go for an intimate meal. If you would rather it be a quieter experience, go earlier in the day. There is also another branch in Kensington which in yet to try, but due to the location and vast bars around the area, this seems to be a great choice. The price is reasonable and more than fair for the high level dining experience. Possibly one of the best Japanese restaurants in London. I would roughly say, \u00a320-\u00a330 per head.I promise you will not be disappointed!",

The atmosphere inside was warm and cozy, but I wasn't a huge fan of the seating arrangement. In lieu of actual tatami mats, there were lowered tables that you have to climb and maneuver your way into. A bit awkward if you've got a dress on like I did!We got edamame to share and I ordered the yasai tempura and tofu bento box. The edamame was average -- there were a few sprinkles of sea salt on top, but the salt wasn't evenly distributed across the beans so there were a couple of bland bites. However, I was pleasantly surprised with my bento box. For around \u00a315, it came with miso soup, rice, salad, perfectly crunchy \u00a0veggie tempura, and four pieces of crispy tofu with a delightful teriyaki-esque sauce drizzled on top. A filling meal for a rainy Saturday night.I'd eat here again if I were in the area and craving sushi!",

    "text": "The food is decent and the price is really cheap for a sushi restaurant in London! My only complaint is that service can be quite slow at times. I've been here with friends twice now - both times we ordered chirashi or katsu bowls, which shouldn't take TOO long to prepare because it's just rice with fish/chicken on top . Unfortunately we've had to wait well over 30 mins both times for our food to come. Still, the restaurant is quite popular and busy, which makes it understandable why the food service is a little slow. I would still return to this restaurant, but I wouldn't recommend it if you were short on time. I'd say you need at least an hour and a half.",

Sushi was really nice but as previous reviews mentioned, I would not recommend going for the ramen as you can get better one next door in Bone Daddies. I had a Salmon Don which was loads of fresh salmon and rice and it was delicious. I also tried their prawn tempura which was amazing as well.What I have to mention as well though is their plum wine. As everything else, it is quite expensive (and if you are looking for something similar but cheaper, go to Eat Tokyo) but the plum wine was unbelievably strong and delicious. In Eat Tokyo you get a red liquid which is very mild and sweet but here, you have a drink with amber colour and tons of alcohol in it. Shame it was not a bit cheaper, would have easily drunk a lot of it and give more stars.",

Unfortunately I wasn't very impressed by the ramen. *sigh*Good things:- The staff were really friendly and helpful- You can book a table! Most London ramen-lands make you line up outside and wait, so it was good to be able to call ahead and book.- The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as some of the other ramen options within walking distance.- Some of the other food including donburi looked pretty good- The d\u00e9cor and atmosphere were niceLess Good:- Don't expect uber authentic Japanese food. The owners and staff are Chinese and Malaysian which is fine, but it just means the flavour is a little Chinese-y-Japanese. - There are a few other issues like spelling mistakes on the menu that might confuse Japanese people. (Like writing Tonkatsu instead of Tonkotsu)- My \"tonkatsu\" tantanmen wasn't spicy at all (it was basically Tonkotsu broth with a little layu dribbled in.) The meat was minced, and not amazing quality, and the pieces were so small that they sunk to the bottom of the soup, so I didn't eat most of them. Ah well.",

The restaurant door does not shut properly. I would advise not to sit near the door. It was very annoying to watch the staff shutting the door each time customers came in.I ordered the sashimi lunch set. The lunch sets are all half the price of the same meals for dinner. The sashimi pieces were small. Obviously half the size! I was very disappointed. The sashimi were too cold and also placed on ice to keep them 'fresher'. Even though the sashimi were cold but I could still taste that they were not that fresh. The miso soup and salad were nice. The table had traces of tobiko, I bet from the previous night's. When the staff served my dishes they saw the tobiko too but chose not to acknowledge the tiny bits of evidence. I can not help it if I am eagle eyed.There were a group of girl students sitting at the table next to me. When the waitress served them miso soups, she did not re-arranged their bento boxes to create spaces. The waitress accidentally spilt the miso soup on the table and onto one of the girls' skirt. I watched the whole scene. The manager was quick to react. He gave the girl some napkins and the waitress also wiped the table. I heard the waitress telling the manager that the customer knocked the soup over. I was gobsmacked! After that I asked the girl if the manager replaced her soup? She said no. Then I said this to her, \"If this is a good restaurant, they would have replaced your soup and maybe give you a discount as a gesture of goodwill\". Obviously this is not a good restaurant!Cheap lunch sets but not cheerful.",

    "text": "I was sadly not impressed by Dozo, even though it looked promising. The local itself is nicely decorated. It has low tables where you can sit on your knees, Japanese-style, or normally (as there are indentations for your feet below the table). I was invited to sit at the back, in a shared table for 8 people all for myself. All good so far.The otoro (fatty tuna) nigiri tasted nice, however the rice went all over the place when I picked the pieces, rather than sticking together as it should, so I basically ate otoro sashimi instead. Considering these are a chef suggestion and quite pricey, it was a little disappointed.The algae salad was average. The maguro tataki was nice, it's one of my favourite dishes and I hadn't eaten it for years, so I was pleased with that one. Then came the tendon (tempura over a bed of rice). The tempura itself was good, the sauce nice, albeit quite sweet. However the rice was bland/overcooked and it was just not appealing without the sauce/tempura, so I did not finish it. As I mentioned at the beginning I was sitting at the very back of the restaurant. Well, for some reason, there were a lot of those tiny flies in that area that were constantly trying to make their way into my food. I grew tired of all the dodging and air waving when one managed to land in my (not yet started) miso soup. After this and the not too impressive lunch I decided to leave and get my dessert elsewhere.I mentioned the annoying little insects to one of the waitresses and she just smiled and left; I suppose she didn't understand what I meant. The head waitress did acknowledge the problem (but if they know then why let people sit there in the first place?).Unfortunately, all in all the experience wasn't what I had in mind, considering the set expectations and how much I paid.",

I love Japanese food and was looking forward to a nice meal. Sadly enough I found the food rather disappointing. It may have been the particular dishes I tried, but I don't feel inclined to go back. I visited Dozo with a couple of friends and we each ordered a dish and shared all of them between us. I picked out the House Tonkatsu Ramen and this was the only dish I remotely enjoyed. Even so I thought the pork was mostly fat, and that wasn't great. Other dishes included the Eel supreme and Volcano Maki rolls and the Unagi Don rice bowl. These three dishes had one thing in common. Sauce. The fresh and clean taste of the fish was in all three cases completely ruined by an overkill of sauce. I have never understood the desire to combine sushi and mayonnaise and I'm afraid I still don't. The flavours were not balanced at all. It was too sweet and too fat for my liking and these are two flavours I do not at all associate with the japanese cuisine.",
