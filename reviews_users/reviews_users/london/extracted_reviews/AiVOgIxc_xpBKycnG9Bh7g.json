    "text": "I stumbled upon this place by chance when heading to meet a friend at his office near Carnaby St and I suggested we go for something to eat there as I really fancied a burger. UNBELIEVABLE!! Although I had no real frills with my dinner, the burger was perfect, the meat was juicy and had so much flavour. My friend went a little more \"out there\" and had one of the grilled sandwiches. I think it was called Ahi Steak (I know it was Yellow Fin if this helps anyone), but regardless, it was also sensational. An added bonus was that I was able to wash all this down with a cold beer (Asahi on tap!!!) which simply topped everything off. We didn't have dessert, but I did see the fruit salad coming out for someone else and just wished we had more time. I don't spend as much time in London as I have before but believe me, I will be back to this place to start working my way through the menu. One of the lovely staff who served us also mentioned that they had not been open for very long so well done to all involved.",

It looks like they've recently had a facelift (at least on the outside). Inside the lack of music was more than noticeable, the hum of the kitchens extractor fan and clatter of pans was all I could hear, a bit disappointing. Music aside the decor is quirky, nice rush ceiling, traditional wooden fans along with Hawaiian posters on the walls add to the exotic feel of the place. Apparently this is the first branch in Europe, there are four in Hawaii and over twenty in Japan. As I was so busy at lunch time I ordered a cheeseburger to go and waited for about 15 minutes while it was prepared. The burger was good but nothing extraordinary...I wasn't crazy about the almost raw onion in mine, so ended up picking this out..",

I settled for this little place just off of Carnaby Street. In all honesty, I thought it might not measure up to the tastes I experienced whilst in Honolulu, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was as authentic as it gets in smoky London town.Just good, satisfying food, everything was fresh and delicious how I remember it was in Hawaii. Was such a good place to chill and catch up with a friend, only downside is how small and popular the place is, had to leave our table sooner than I'd like, but I'm definitely going to return back.",

The food was of good quality, I had the beef and haloumi burger with sweet potato fries and for a drink we shared a pitcher of Sangria. The atmosphere is certainly a winner at this establishment, the service is excellent as is the quality of the food the only draw back would be the portion sizes, slightly too small for my liking.

So I was doubting whether I should go but thought I'd give it a try.We went on a Sunday afternoon... The place was busy so I was happy about it. We waited for about 5 mins for a table for 4.Food: \u00a0Good size portion. It cannot go wrong with Burgers & Chips but I couldn't taste the \"Lava Grilled\" as they said. The choc chip and chocolate sauce fluffy pancake was dry and sauceless. Have they ran out of ingredients?Ambience: Busy, buzzing, lack of space and very cold. It looks like the chef was too hot so they decided to turn on the cooler/air con and all of us had to put our coats on. They have placed the comfort of their staff rather than their customers.Service: Awful & chaotic. I wouldn't think a chef would be taking your orders or bringing you the drinks. It was very disorganise and no one seems to know which table they are waiting or on a more serious note, what their job is for the day.I'm quite embarrass that I took my friend who was visiting London to Kua'Aina. He was pleased with the burger & chips but that was about it.Another one of those burger joint that opened due to the boom of \"burgers\" cuisine in London (even though they have branches in Hawaii & Japan). They must have just bought the name rather than the quality of the food with them.Bring me back Byron Burger or Honest Burger anytime,",

    "text": "Hawaiian boigers - who'd-a thunk it? Well, the guys behind bringing Kua'Aina over here to London, obviously.The sandwich/burger chain previously only had outlets in Hawaii and one or two in Tokyo, meaning that us Londoners are the next lucky ones to get in on the love.The burgers and fries here - both, plural, not one-or-the-other - are amazing. Charred, slightly pink in the middle, and, if you're that way inclined, slathered with perfectly-ripe avo and juicy griddled bacon (the beasts come in 1/3 or 1/2lb patties). The fries are skinny, crispy, potatoe-y, seasoned beauties. Really, I'm not much of a chips kinda guy, but these were the perfect foil for the big, fat burger in front of me. Both bits of my meal were possibly the best I've had in the capital.The interiors are interesting and fun - the open front and ground floor are not particularly heavily-themed, but walk downstairs and you'll discover a basement Tiki bar/lounge vibe with two six seater booths downstairs, surf paraphenalia everywhere, and pictures on the walls (including one of Barack Obama serving up a sandwich at one of Kua'Ainas Hawaiian branches!).The only reason this place doesn't quite hit the five-star mark is that their drinks selection could be as inspired as the food - the restaurants in other countries serve bubble teas and other beverages, whereas as far as I could see there were the standard bottled beers/Coca Cola options prevalent elsewhere. Still, I'm being picky here, and if there was a 4.5 star option here I'd check it.For barely breaking a tenner, you'd be genuinely hard-pushed to find better quality food and vibe in the West End.",

I walked past here and was intrigued by the obvious Hawaii theme, it was about 1200 and there were people inside and out. Came back a wee bit later and I decided this place would suit me, a warm welcome and I was seated at the back of the restaurant. It is snug to say the least, so don't come here if you don't want people to hear what you are talking about - and be prepared to pass the ketchup over! I had a cheese burger and a diet coke, sweet potato fries also. They do burgers in 1/3 & 1/2 lb portions, I went for a third, and it was plenty. They grill a whole onion slice and put it on top, fresh lettuce and tomato, mayo and obv some cheese. The bun was really soft, which is key to good burger in my opinion, a little sweet, delightful.Sweet potato is my favourite potato, if we could hang out, we would regularly, and these fries were the bomb! Lightly salted, the menu says chunky but they are really just not quite as skinny as the regular chips.Service was fast, though my waiter wasn't as friendly as the other guys, the grill chef was happy that I thanked him on the way out.... He deserved it!",

    "text": "We have been reluctant to try burgers in this country, and the ones we tried were all disappointing. Finally our quest for decent burger in London is over! Their 1/2 pound Ortega burger was perfectly seasoned and char-grilled, and came with a big slice of tomato, fresh lettuce and grilled sweet onion & chilli, sandwiched between soft sesame bun. It's the most authentic Hawaiian burger I've tasted outside Hawaii. The only minor flaw was that it was so juicy, the bottom got soggy; maybe the grilled chilli was the cause. Other than that, it was just superb! Sweet Potato Wedges were simply excellent, and so were the Crunch Fries. They were crunchy outside, soft inside, and were full of flavours. They have nice seasoning - personally we like them a bit less salty. My partner ordered Char-grilled Sirloin Steak Sandwich. A big mistake! The meat was very tough and lacked flavour. I think we should stick with their burger from now on. The waitress was from Hawaii and we had a lovely chat. The service was efficient and very friendly and polite - just like you get in Hawaii. The place was busy at lunch time and we had American business people at the next table, tucking in in their burgers and Teriyaki Chicken Salad. They use Kikkoman soya sauce, so I might be tempted to try in future. I could easily give them five stars for their burger, fries and services, but the sandwiches let us down. Therefore my score should read 4.5. Don't go anywhere else for your burger.",

    "text": "Hawaii's best burgers can be found in Hawaii---well that's expected, Japan---sure that's a bit odd, but certainly plausible, but also on Carnaby Street? Really? Does anyone in London even know what Mahalo means? Well, if you've been aching for some aloha love, give Kua 'Aina a go. Here you can find delicious big (1/3 pound) or bigger (1/2 pound) burgers and sandwiches like teriyaki chicken and mahi mahi. My go to stable though is the 1/2 pounder with grilled pineapple on a multi-seed bun along with a side of sweet potato wedges, though the teriyaki chicken also with grilled pineapple comes a close second. Prices are reasonable, and there is waiter service, though you order at the counter. There is also a dangerous frequent burger card which will get you coming back and back for a taste of the tropics.",

The service was hit and miss. \u00a0One server was spot on, the \u00a0others stood around chatting when I was trying to get their attention, very annoying. \u00a0The haloumi and pepper sandwich was delicious but not hot only luke warm. \u00a0I was with 5 friends who enjoyed their burgers. \u00a0Unfortunately we had to send back the \u00a04 portions of \u00a0sweet potato fries as they too were cold. \u00a0Credit to the server who was good, she replaced them with no quibble and took them off the bill. This place does nice food, not expensive but I've had better. Xoxo",

Seated downstairs, one of their friend staff, Lisa took great care of us. I had the juiciest pineapple burger, sweet onion and lettuce burger. Seasoned exactly right, the juices of the medium cooked patty and the freshly sliced pineapple don't run on your face. Kudos for that!Playing healthy, I got the side salad to go with it, and to be honest... it was nothing but a meal itself! Big portioned salad with rocket leaves, canned corn, diced tomato, cucumber and shredded carrot .Nice vinegar dressing and some tabasco drops that I added to give it an extra kick. This time I didn't try any of the ales, but I'll definitely go back to give 'em a go! UP:- Great atmosphere, feels like your bros grilling in the backyard under a shiny sky! Now I've got an idea how a Hawaiian home feels. - Quick service. That matters and it was good. - Great value for money. DOWN:- My friend got the BLT sandwich and the bacon was a bit on the salty side, according to her. VERDICT:Hell yeah!!!!",

They seated us almost immediately despite having a crowd. The decor is campy and I loved it. I love the Hawaiian mood and felt like I was there! The burgers are the best I've had in the UK. Holy moly. This is a delicious burger: juicy, perfectly cooked and fresh. I loved it and I think about this burger often. Yum. The fries were perfect too. If you're in town and want a burger, this is your place!!",

Props to the waiter for taking it off the bill immediately. Also took a while to let the staff know about the Yelp offer as they said management had not let them know about this so they had to call them to confirm. With the Yelp check-in offer for free fries I'd definitely recommend a visit. Without the free fries, I'd say there were better burgers on the Londonscape. Will be back to try a sandwich sometime.",

Meat was seasoned just right.Bumped up the ladder from a three because the beef is grass-fed and the burgers were cooked to medium perfection; also, they offer a 'burger salad', perfect for when I don't feel like awkwardly explaining that I'd like my burger served on greens rather than a roll.Price reflects the quality of the product you get, and you will be wobbling out of here after one of the half-pounders, because dayum.",

    "text": "I have been to this place a few times and have to admit, one of the cool places in London. What's more!? A Hawaiian ambience and tasty big portions, nicely filled beef burgers (from Devon..yum)!! A little pasting of the typical red and green chilly sauces abundantly available in the eatery (if you can't find it, ask, they are nice and sweet bunch of people who wish you with a pleasant smile while you walk into and out of the eatery but not in a forced or creepy way but rather to make sure you have a good time). There is plenty available on the menu including sandwiches and Fish too. Personally i have only had burgers - cheese/hallumi/portobello mushroom/bacon & cheese/avocado all on separate occasion (okay, I know I am a foodie but dont think i can manage all that in one go! But I love challenges and I might try..ha!). The sides, pretty standard - colesaw, olives and fries. Personally, what tops for me is not the normal but their Sweet Potato Fries. They are simply great!Although a two level seating indoors is available, they are not massive on big groups and generally take up to a max of 6 with a bit of waiting (I hope not all wish to relief in the restrooms at once coz they only have one cubical each for M & F :P ) The basement does get warmer in summer but is offset by outdoor seating although not massive since its a slip in from Carnaby street.Final Word: Hungry/want big portions/ good fillings/a relaxed poster draped ambience/Hawaiian pinch/ Oxford circus area - any one of these and go for it.And finally say \"Mahalo!\" (When you leave..Thanks in Hawaiian).\"Cheerio\" (When I leave.. Goodbye in English..ha!)",

    "text": "I went to Kua 'Aina on a whim. \u00a0Was looking for a place to eat, passed by, and thought it looked interesting.First impressions: very tiny - which is not necessarily a bad thing. \u00a0Cozy can be nice, but when there isn't a free table and you need to wait for one, there is no space to stand or sit and wait without completely hovering over someone's table or being in the way of staff and customers trying to get by.Next impressions: Outside of the food, the Hawaiian ties were subtle - in fact, so subtle, I would have never known. \u00a0A few pics on the wall of \"Hawaii\" and a random pic of Tom Selleck from Mangum P.I. (filmed in Hawaii) was about it. \u00a0I would have expected the music to be a soothing throwback to steel guitars or Hawaiian folk; instead, it was a typical pop station. \u00a0Not very fitting of a Hawaiian-themed place.Menu: With one exception, I was pleasantly surprised. \u00a0Nice selection of different food, and was extremely happy to see Mahi Mahi. \u00a0One of my favorite fish, very hard to find in England, and they had, what ended being a very tasty sandwich. \u00a0Very happy with the taste (I say taste because I have one issue which I'll address in a bit). \u00a0My partner had a teriyaki chicken salad; also very tasty. \u00a0The one thing that wasn't great, were the \"Hawaiian\" salsa and chips. \u00a0I quote Hawaiian because it was some of the blandest salsa I've ever had in my life, and all they did was pour a few corn chips on a plate and dump some diced tomatoes mixed with a few things on top and charged me \u00a34.00 for it. \u00a0Very dissatisfied with that.Price for Portion: It wasn't too bad, considering it was London; however, given the portion size, it was (in my opinion) quite overpriced. \u00a0My sandwich, although very nice, was just a sandwich with nothing but half a carrot on the side, and cost me almost \u00a39.00. \u00a0My partner's salad, again, although good, was just over \u00a38.00 and it was quite small. \u00a0Our \"large\" fries that we shared would barely constitue as a medium size (set me back \u00a33.50) and, well, I've already covered the chips and (for lack of a better word) salsa.Service: Here's one area I am very touchy about, having successfully trained servers in several restaurants. \u00a0The girl that served us, seemed a bit inexperienced, but made up for it with her tremendous attitude. \u00a0She always smiled and couldn't have been nicer. \u00a0The drinks and food were delivered in a timely manner and she was nearby when we wanted our bill.Overall, liked the food (chips sucked), stoaked they had Mahi Mahi, service was nice, but cramped and very overpriced. \u00a0Would have been happier if the sandwich was around \u00a35-6 and the salad was around \u00a36-7, and would keep coming back if they were those prices - otherwise, it's unlikely I would eat here often or even on a semi-regular basis.Mahalo Kua 'Aina for some nice food, but Mahalo a'ohe, I won't be coming back unless you drop your prices.",

The sweet potato chips are highly recommended!This place is a lot like a typical Hawaiian restaurant near the beach. In fact, it literally IS exactly that, except for the lack of ocean here in Soho. I spent a few weeks on various islands in Hawaii earlier this year, and made a point of visiting the original Kua'Auna there. In Hawaii there are several other places like this, but not here in the UK. In Britain, this is the closest you will get to the experience of Hawaiian beach culture, without a long flight to the remotest landmass on the planet.Highlights include a good selection of burgers and sandwiches, beers and juices etc, all perfectly in line with the backdrop of a tropical theme evoking the true atmosphere of a genuine Polynesian archipelago beach-side grill -- right down to the surf videos on loop and the surf boards and photos on display.Enjoy! :P",

It was just like I remembered - yummy grilled pineapple, perfectly ripe avocado, and great fish. We ordered the sweet potato fries which lasted about 2 seconds.Our toddler loved the pancakes.

We went downstairs and had a little cave like table in the corner so it felt like a private room.I ordered the Big Wave lager, salt and pepper squid and the chicken and pineapple on wholemeal square bread. I must say, I have not been been impressed by a new place in a looong time! Absolutely delicious. The lager was fresh, crisp and refreshing. Very drinkable and I quickly drank my pint as it was so tasty. The salt and pepper squid was great value! It came out looking like onion rings. Very big rings with garlic mayo. The breaking was great! Actually stayed on the squid and didn't disintegrate in my hand whilst eating haha. I was expecting a very small portion (as I often do when I order calamari or squid apps), but I found myself needing to give 1.5 rings away! Amazing flavour and filling!My main course was the chicken and pineapple. Very delicious! Sweet grilled pineapple and the chicken was cooked perfectly. Juicy, full of flavour and fresh tasting. It was served on brown bread as I asked my waitress to surprise me, and I'm so glad with her choice as I think I wouldn't have ordered it this way myself. Would definitely get this exact order again. So good, I'm thinking about it the next day and figuring out when to go back!I would say that the food is very delicious and tasty however as it is a small place, finding a table may be hard and waiters/waitresses have a lot of people to look after. Be patient and you're in for a great Hawaiian inspired feast!",

    "text": "I was about to head home after an event when a particularly lovely bunch of yelpers said they were going to try and get a late food stop here. I've been meaning to try it for a while so FOMO struck and I decided to tag along!It's a fun place for a burger stop - bright and colourful, in decor and staff uniforms. I was chuffed to spot the Pineapple Burger on the menu as I have a lot of love for this humble fruit - in curries, as fritters, on pizza, you name it! The only unforeseen issue was that the extra centimetre thickness of pineapple in the burger made it juuuust too tall to fit in my mouth. I ended up taking it out and munching it separately between bites of the burger. I don't regret the choice though - the patty had a lovely medium pink tinge and I liked the taste the grilled onion added. Crucially for me though the burger held its structure as I ate without turning into a wet sloppy mess - an underrated but oh-so-important quality!It was already later than usual when we arrived so I wasn't quite as hungry as I might've been - luckily I had two willing volunteers to share my favourite side - sweet potato fries of course - which were delicious as expected. I also quite wanted to try a hard shake but couldn't manage a whole one - so we shared a choc and bourbon shake too! We couldn't taste the booze in it at first (clearly hardened drinkers that we are) but it got stronger about halfway through. I think others at the table seemed to be enjoying their avo burgers and salads too.The food and drink then were as tasty as I'd been led to believe - but there were a few let-downs that kept this out of 5-star territory for me. The servers were v friendly but had a fail at the very start, as a miscommunication meant another group were seated in the downstairs alcove that another waiter had earmarked for us. Instead we found ourselves a little squished around a smaller table, which I didn't mind were it not for the guy sat at the next table who backed his chair out into my ribs a couple of times because I was sitting right at the end of the bench. The cutlery that was plonked in the middle of the table also wasn't very clean, though I think people got involved with fingers anyway.I do like the vibe here though and the food was tasty, so peer pressure turned out to be a good thing for me! I'd visit again, probably in a smaller group next time - it's pretty good value for money for the area too.",

The staff is very nice and the food is quickly served. The location is great being located right off of Carnaby street and a short walk from Oxford Circus station. I have been here a handful of times and the service and food has stayed consistent. Highly recommend. ***Note: This location is best for a small group of people due to the small size of the restaurant.",

Well, let me assure they were fantastic! The blueberries and banana were baked inside the pancakes, so were pretty cool to look at and tasted amazing! Service is really good and the staff are so friendly! Can't really recommend visiting enough! Have to say, if you come for lunch/ dinner et the sweet potato fries, no matter what else you order. They are simply phenomenal!!",

    "text": "This particular visit on a Thursday night was really disappointing. They were clearly understaffed and unorganised. We sat downstairs and there was just one waitress serving. She looked harassed, miserable and needed help. \u00a0Add to that there was zero ambience (why was there no music?), terrible stock issues and long delays. When after a 20 minute wait we were finally asked if we wanted to drinks, we couldn't order the ones we wanted because they ran out of rum...what the...???Then after another long wait our food orders were taken. However 15 minutes later a staff member came by to let me know that they have ran out of tuna steak and to order something else (thanks for letting me know so quickly!). So I did order something else. But when the food arrived, I was surprised to see tuna after all. It was enjoyable to but I was all geared up for chicken now. I like to know what I am expecting when I order. And there was no explanation why it was back on my plate. \u00a0I hope it was a glitch, as I had a previous more successful visit to the Charlotte Street branch of Kua'Aina, but this trip has put me off the whole chain for now.",

A catalog of error and bad food!1. We arrived, and whilst the restaurant didn't seem busy, they were very heavily backlogged. It took 15 minutes to get a drink and when friends arrived, it took longer to receive theirs.2. It took the waitress ages to take our order.3. About 30 minutes later we chased her up, apparently it had been lost in the kitchen, but she assured us she'd rush the order.4. We ordered the Macadamia nut mix and corn chips nacho's to tide us over for the main course - it came burnt and chips were dry and tasteless. 5. We'd ordered a selection of burgers for the table, when they finally all arrived, they all came burnt... however by this point we'd already given up on the meal. The chips were soggy and pastey, and we had to fight to get sauce.6. Our final round of drinks took so long (apparently they lost the order in the bar), so the the waitress gave us them for free.I was so unimpressed. Whilst the waitress was friendly, it was really just a waste of our time and in the end, just a terrible meal.",

I really wanted to give them 5*, and I think I would have done, if I hadn't been made to realise how close and small the tables were-by the fact we ended up sat well within kneeing and sneezing distance of an absolute moron, he was loud and obnoxious, and quite possibly on something other than the drug of life sat with his mid teen son. When he lent over our meals to reach for the sauces, I just wished the tables were further apart, and the tables not against the walls had bottles on themselves!It wasn't the restaurant or the staffs fault that we were sat next to a loudmouth training his son to be a pervert, and the staff were extremely professional and lovely despite his bad attitude, so super kudos to them for that, but I feel like I wouldn't have been bothered if the tables weren't cramped.Definitely recommended for the food, but ask to be seated downstairs!",

It's more like a cheap, happy fast food stall than a restaurant...but that is the kind of atmosphere I like with burgers. Yay!The burger itself was juicy, a little pink in the middle and gorgeous. I looved the huge onion, juicy tomato and perfectly squishy avocado that came with it, but I couldn't quite get my mouth around everything!! This burger requires some epic mouth exercise to work your way into the first bite! ...and then I tried the sweet potato fries. I really, really like sweet potato fries! These ones were crunchy on the outside, squishy in the middle and just perfect! Omnomnom they take the whole kua 'aina experience to burger heaven.",

    "text": "A fun burger joint on Foubert's Place, as far as I know the only outpost in London, it's a Hawaiian joint, but that does not mean pineapple or spam on everything, just that it started there and has continued the Hawaiian theme of d\u00e9cor. Pineapple is still available though. The burgers are tasty but the sweet potato fries are what keeps me coming back. Normally happy with their standard cheeseburger, but the avocado does provide an extra creamy flavour that's hard to describe but tastes really good! It may look like a fast food burger joint, but this is a seriously good burger.The staff there have always been friendly, but the place can get a little cramped, the tables upstairs being better in my opinion for service. They do takeaway but you'll need a lot of napkins!BTW, I know I said they don't do Spam, but they've told me you can bring some in yourself and they will add it to your burger.",

I got my breakfast after all. They had several choices of American (erm, Hawaiian) pancakes, but I went with the 3 chocolate chips pancakes (milk, dark, chocolate). It was deeeeelicious.
