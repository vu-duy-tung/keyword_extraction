As it is in Maida Vale, the other customers are very posh, and the waiters reflect their slightly upturned-nose attitude. Despite this, one cannot deny that the food makes up for any thing else that may be wrong.",

We went for brunch, it was quite busy and the only table available when we got to the front of the queue was for 3 people - we were told we could sit at it anyway. The food was good - freshly squeezed orange juice, good coffee and good english breakfast. However, after we'd eaten but while we were waiting for more coffee they asked us to move to another table, which we didn't want to do, and they were so forceful we decided to leave. We didn't pay the optional service charge which resulted in a heated debate with the member of staff who couldn't understand why we didn't want to pay. It's shame, but we won't be going back.",

    "text": "This is very difficult for me to write. \u00a0This deli has many great things: olive paste, hummus, sun blushed tomatoes, eggs, cheeses, etc. Lattes and juice also good. \u00a0The pasta is expensive but tasty. \u00a0Because I live in the neighborhood and work strange hours, I am here almost daily. Yes, it's exorbitant. But it's also convenient, and as an American, you know how addicted we are to ease of use, ease of access, and cartoons with lots of BLAMS and POWS and MOZZARELLA. \u00a0The problem with Raoul's is the cunning and cruel manager, who is a complete tool, a black hole of light and happiness, and world class jerk. \u00a0Though I've spent literally thousands of pounds in the store over the last two years, he barely acknowledges my presence (or anyone else's). \u00a0I don't care; but is it too much to smile once in a while? \u00a0I've seen him slam phones, scold workers that they missed a spot on the glass door, and act horribly to countless members of his staf fand paying customers. There have literally been dozens of new staff -- the turnover is appalling. Each week there are new people making the lattes. \u00a0I think the Americancasualty \u00a0rate at Omaha Beach during D-Day was less. \u00a0And I don't blame them. \u00a0And least many of my brave fellow Americans had their misery ended quickly with a Jerry bullet between the eyes.When the manager is not on premises, there is actually a little bit of life, happiness, a few furtive grins even, by the indentured servants. But when Bungholio, the darkling prince, is snarling and sneering and generally acting like someone's shoved a watermelon-sized pepper up his gorgonzola... then the experience is about as pleasant as watching a tipsy Wayne Rooney scope out the octogenarian talent at the Lady Veterans of WWI's Bi-Monthly \u00a0Bingo and Jello Fest -- \"Oh please don't leave without trying the jellied eels, Wayne!\" Bingo! We've got a winner!Where was I? Oh yes. Sorry. \u00a0Raoul's. \u00a0Some brilliant food. \u00a0Some brilliant counter help. And one of Satan's own lieutenants (minus the sense of humour) running the place. I wouldn't hire this guy to oversee the kitchen of a penal colony on Mars. \u00a0His negative energy leaves a sour taste in my mouth that even the sublime scorched almond candies can't erase. \u00a0Does England still banish undesirables to America and Australia? \u00a0Can't the Home Office deport him? \u00a0But still, like a dog to his vomit, I return. \u00a0So maybe I'm the one with the problem.",

I ordered the 8oz free range hamburger with fries and an extra portion of roasted Mediterranean vegetables. My friend had the pan-fried cod and a side order of spinach. My burger was cooked medium as requested. However, it was very dry and just tasted very plain. The roasted veg was expected. My friend's cod was slightly overcooked and the spinach just looked and tasted pathetic. The prices of the mains were from \u00a315-\u00a325, and for the poor quality, it was just not worth it. Service was also subpar. While the one waitress who waited on us was nice, the other 2 just looked miserable to be there. They couldn't muster a smile or looked at us when we arrived, were dining or left. Overall, for this price point, this place is expensive and disappointing particularly for this area in London. I would go as far to say tourist trap restaurants in Central London like Leicester Square serve better food. Come here only if you wish to be served school cafeteria standard food at 3-4 times the price.",

Like a lady addicted to bad boys I keep giving it one more chance, only to be disappointed,On the plus side the food is pleasant and the menu is wide ranging. However the food isn't particularly cheap (around \u00a37 for a welsh rarebit - effectively cheese on toast!), and although it's good, it is not exceptional enough to make it worth the slopish service. Raoul's is obviously busiest on Sunday, the day the good lord decreed brunch-day, but I expect them to cope. This afternoon I had to attract the staff's attention for them to take our order, after waiting for 15 minutes I realised it was not going to happen without any intervention. Then after they brought out everyone else's food, I had to remind them about my order. Very frustrating and also it made me feel very uncomfortable asking. Unfortunately I am sure I'll be back, their eggs benedict with smoke salmon is just my type and keeps making eyes at me. \u00a0That will be your final chance Raoul, you better treat me good next time.",

I can't speak for the breakfast and lunch offerings, but the lattes were fantastic (caffeine fiends should request an extra shot; these are on the mild side), entirely lacking that lovely charred Starbuck's flavor I typically have to settle for when in strange lands. The below reviews are spot-on about the service, however. They do seem a bit put out when you have special needs, like, say, ordering? But they still manage three stars for the surprise of wheat-free chocolate cake. For a girl with a wheat allergy, this was an unexpected delicacy that practically rendered the bad service null and void. (Note: for kinder and quicker service, try Raoul's deli/bakery across the street. Same great espresso, even more treats for the road.)",

Nothing complicated, no additional instructions, just \"a Latte, please\" The waiter turned on his heel, and didn't even say acknowledge me, nod at me or anything! Ten minutes later, a girl arrived, asked if she could help. I said \"well, I ordered a Latte with your colleague, but it hasn't arrived\" she goes off to ask. He growls that of course he remembers, but he has other orders to do. (funny that, i was the first person in the place)15 minutes pass, friends arrive, order their coffee. Mine STILL hasn't arrived, so i say cancel the coffee, I'd like Earl grey with my breakfast. (coffee and eggs isn't a great combo.) Attitude from the waiter.. you ordered it, you must pay for it blah blah.. I wouldn't mind if the damn thing was on the table!! So, to breakfast... as usual, the eggs royale / salmon benedict whatever you want to call them, were lovely. nice hollandaise, slightly soft muffin, but not a problem. Then there's the small matter of side orders. I fancied some spinach.. \u00a34!!!!!!!!! for two spoonfuls of decidedly average steamed spinach. not good.And my friend asked if she could have an extra poached egg with her scrambles- oh no, no changes to the menu. (she was more than happy to pay, but wasn't allowed) I have tried and tried with Raouls Maida Vale, this will be my last visit- there are so many more wonderful places not to need to waste time and money being treated like a fool. *Hammersmith and Notting Hill have much better service, but still maintain the awkward no changes policy.",

    "text": "REVIEW OF RAOULS RESTAURANT CLIFTON RD If there's one word that springs to mind to describe my experience of this place, then it has to be 'anticlimax'. Allow me to explain As you've probably gathered by now if youve read any of my other reviews, I've grown up in Maida Vale and so these local restaurants/eateries have been pretty much part of my visual landscape for almost two decades now. When you see something over and over day in day out, it begins to weave itself into the tapestry of your life, more than often, being something that you just take for granted, visually that is. Think of any road you may walk down every day in your life. Have you ever stopped to study each and every door and building and object that lies along the way? Because I can assure you, you will be surprised at what you might find. Things you've been walking past for years, that you never knew existed. To give a very diluted example of this, I only recently noticed by accident, that each and every black baluster making up the long line of balustrade that runs the full length of Hyde Park adjacent to Rotten Row separating the row from the cycle path, has written on it, names of deceased people. The names are written in black in the same colour as the balustrade, so unless you actually bend over and take a good look at them, it's hardly noticeable. And this is not advisable, because you will probably end up with your name on one of them too, having been mowed down by one of the oncoming cyclists. Not the best of examples (I can think of loads more, like the river that runs in the air right through Sloane Sq tube station), but still, it illustrates how we just take things for granted, without ever really truly knowing (or more accurately, bothering ourselves to know) what lurks behind the facade that lines our streets. For me, Raouls cafe was just this; one of the few jewel-like corner-stones that laid the foundations down for the character and soul of the now-ruined Clifton Rd, in Little Venice; along with Vickis cafe (now Molly's!) across the way, the now non-existent Post office on the corner (the decommissioning of this place was simply a crime), Superfoods, a beautifully quaint, spotless, gleaming 1950's American styled supermarket (complete with background chiming music) that was gobbled up by Tescos around 2004, Cullens, residing just next door, the perfect antidote to the sterilized feel of commercialized supermarket shopping, and the two newsagents that flanked the supermarkets on either side. Raouls was (and still is) Little Venice's flagship restaurant. One of it's remarkable qualities, is that it has this wonderful chameleon-like ability to change it's form, function and guise during the course of the day. In the mornings (I believe this is the best time to experience what Raouls has to offer), it's like one of those New York style breakfast bashers, serving up good quality morning grub (so I've gathered). At lunchtime it magically turns into a bistro! De-deer! Filled with Little Venician mothers nattering away at each other like there's no tomorrow, using words like 'parsimonious'; a smattering of MaidaVale glitterati; local business people etc grabbing a bite to eat whilst simultaneously doing business verbally; and the obligatory local St John's Wood/Maidavale 'rich folk' whiling away their free time (and daddy's money) whilst casually sipping away at the current fashionable version of a particular style of coffee. Come late afternoon, Raouls suffers a slight bout of multiple-personality-disorder, it doesn't know which way to turn, having a bit of a problem deciding whether or not to remain as restaurant for the remainder of the day, or slip back into it's cafeteria attire for a couple of hours or so. Food is available all day, but I think afternoons is teatime here, to be honest. Then in the evening, its full-on restaurant time, right up until last orders which is around 10.30pm to 11pm. I had a meal here once, through no choice of my own. My father was renovating his house round the corner and it was temporarily gutted out. We'd been living off takeaways for weeks, and were bored of the same ones, so we decided to try Raouls out, reluctantly may I add; for the first time in twenty years. I'd been there a couple of times before with my mum, but just for a glass of wine or something like that, not food. We were late, and so scurried down the hill to try and make it in time. As usual, the place was packed out and really bustling. The sonourous blend of clinking and clanking coupled with the mild roar of alcohol induced conversation completely blasted me the second I opened the front door; not to mention the accompanying gust of stares, and the gust of wind that followed it, blowing my Beatles hairbob into a freshly erected Amy Winehouse bouffant, plastering my innocent looking physiognomy backwards by a millimeter or two, like I had just recovered from a facelift whilst simultaneously accelerating from 0-2000mph in",

Given that the prices are not exactly cheap, it always astounds me that the rotating staff here can be so inefficient. The blonde-bobbed proprietor is probably to blame. She's perfectly polite to anyone male, but rude as anything to female customers. It's such a joke that it's almost worth buying something here to watch her in action! Last comment - always double check your receipt. They once charged us \u00a320.00 for a chicken but we didn't check the card receipt until we got home and realised their mistake. Needless to say we went straight back to ask for a refund. Summary - good food, good quality, good selection in the deli but terrible service. Cafe has good menu, especially for brunch, nice staff but expensive.",

    "text": "On a recent visit here I went for the Eggs Benedict for late breakfast and after a very short time, my food arrived.The Benedict sauce was tasty but very sour and tart, the ham was of a lower grade than I would expect for a supposedly higher-end restaurant. The small portion and lack of presentation/garnish capped it all. One of my pet hates also came my way... grubby finger marks around the plate's edge.Raoul's makes up for the lack of English comprehension of it's staff by just having plenty of them. I find it troubling that the waiters can not grasp my order even when it is a plain old stock item from the menu. God help those with a nut allergy, trying to ascertain ingredients... The restaurant is nicely decorated and well presented. It feels buzzy and lively, even when there are only a few customers present.To be truly fair to Raoul's Deli, I returned a few days later. The meat Mezze I had was really great tasting, but I had to complain that the Kofte kebab was still raw in the middle... after much language barrier based confusion, my plate was grabbed away and reappeared ten minutes later with the same pieces of meat - bite marks 'n all - cooked to \"well done\".Personally I would have preferred to have continued eating my dish and they could have made me some sufficiently cooked meat. But I did not get a say in that...There may be a time when I return to Raoul's Deli - when I do, I really hope I have the chance to write a positive review - I really want to like this place!N.B. Raoul's pre-adds service charge to bill.No WIFI.",

We said...no salmon to go doesn't sound very appetizing.

The brownie came out looking rather strange: it was a rectangular cut that looked too flat and too long. It also looked like it had been sitting there for quite a while. Also, the cream had started melting and had already soaked my napkin - which made the napkin useless.The brownie was just the right temperature - obviously microwaved but it doesn't matter - and the cream was just the right sweetness to pair with the brownie. The brownie was rich and moist - and though I was still put off by the look of it, I have nothing to complain about regarding the taste. It was delicious.I assume that the strudel was good as well, as my friend finished it before I was done with mine. The prices weren't cheap, but not extravagant. I would highly recommend the brownie with cream if you are ever trying to decide on a dessert at Raoul's!",

It's on the small side, seems to always have a queue (good sign the food is good) but worth the short wait. Very friendly staff and quick service.. The deco is trendy modern 60's revival with B&W photos (including a young John Lennon), op-arty leaf wallpaper (in the back section) and custom cut-out wood wall screens. A few outdoor tables are available and a couple of hearty souls were outside in the snow today with their adorable black lab looking anxiously at their bacon! Prices are moderate, reflecting the quality and atmosphere.I had the Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon done perfectly. To my delight, they use eggs that have the deepest orange yolks I've ever seen. Google answers indicate this is based on a better diet, possibly including maize, and less stress both of which may also indicate free-range hens. Although marigolds have been known to make the yolk darker, the flavor of the eggs at Raoul's tells me that their eggs would be the free-range version. Delicious! I'm a convert!Across the street is Raoul's Deli for amazing take-out. Their cheesecakes, cakes and pastries look scrumptious. I'll be returning to sample them. Stay tuned for another Raoul's Deli review!",
