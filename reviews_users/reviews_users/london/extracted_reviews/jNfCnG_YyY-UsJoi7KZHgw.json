I went up and placed my order, and was told it would be about a 15 minute wait, which bothered me not one bit. Surprisingly, after only 5 minutes of waiting on the little bench next to the free refill soda bit, out came my meal. The staff were really nice in here, and served with a smile.

All I know is that they served chicken, and lots of it. I didn't know if it was African, Portuguese, or Chilean. I just knew they had chicken and different sauces. I didn't know if it was fast-food, a dive, or a fancy restaurant. Just that Jon Richardson gets takeaway from there and eats it all alone because he has bad luck with the ladies.My boss insisted on going to Nandos; he lived in London for about six months and had an affinity for the chain, so we went. And waited about 20 minutes to be seated, as we approached during the lunch rush. The chicken and sides were pretty good, some of the sauces too spicy for my tender palate, but it was still pretty tasty. It certainly wasn't worth the 20 minute wait, and if I'm lucky enough to require a fast-food lunch option in the UK, I'll certainly choose Nandos over McDonald's or the fare at the touristy-end of Camden Market.",

Every single time we loved our meal and ended up paying less than we would've at a \"fancier\" restaurant. Yes, it's a chain, but don't judge this place based on that. The Portuguese-South African style chicken is great. We tried the wraps and also the various meals that came with sides. Corn is good here and mashed potatoes! Also enjoyed the fries; make sure they don't forget to put the spices on them. We got these meals \"hot\" and could feel our lips tingling after each meal. On our third visit we got a free 1/4 chicken meal, which was nice. And they serve cider! Sauces are amazing. Love the garlic and also had the very hot sauce; YUM. Should've figured out how to bring some back to the USA! It gets crowded here and after one visit you can tell why.",

The first time I went with friends the server asked if we had been there before and when we replied no, he sat us at a table and left. It wasn't until 20 minutes later waiting for him to come back that another server came over to us - mostly likely because we looked confused as to why we hadn't been served yet - and explained that you order at the counter. That aside, the food is amazing. I had the mango and lime wings with peri-salted chips and a salad. It was surprisingly filling but rather expensive in my opinion once you convert the 8.99 to American dollars. I'd definitely come back on my next trip though!",

I loved the peri peri sauce. The spice/heat level was a pleasant surprise. \u00a0Would definitely recommend Nandos to anyone staying in London. Yeah it's a franchise, but my meal at Nando's beat out some forgettable meals at places that charged more than double.",

    "text": "Came in on a Saturday night after getting off a flight from Berlin. It was packed inside, but we were greeted promptly by a cheerful waitress. I explained that it was our first time and she kindly explained how things worked, then we were seated within minutes. You come in, get seated, order at the counter, and the wait staff will bring you the food. You get your own sauces (the whole bottle if you want, or you can pour them out), napkins, drinks, and dinnerware\u200b.We didn't want to get too full, so we opted to do half a chicken combo and a burger with the Halloumi appetizer. Everything came out relatively quickly and we had just enough time to get our drinks, utensils\u200b and the sauces. Us being spoiled Americans, we were so glad to see ice and unlimited refills on soft drinks! The Fanta was really good.The Halloumi tasted like a water mozzarella\u200b cheese, but strangely tasty. The sauce was very sweet and just a tiny bit spicy. The chicken was very flavorful and really didn't need any sauce. It was a bit on the drier\u200b side, but I've had worse. The burger was very good, but I only had a bite so it's not fair for me to elaborate more. The green peas on the side were minty indeed, but definitely lacking salt. I ended up putting a ton of salt on it to make it more palatable.Overall, the experience was very pleasant and everyone was friendly. The tables are close to each other, so keep that in mind if you're not comfortable with it. We love spicy food, so we ended up purchasing a bottle of the X sauce to take home (though all sauces were delicious).P.S.We also ordered their wings roulette for take out. I'm not sure if it was just because we can handle spice or if none of them were spicy...but I don't think we got any spicy ones.",

Nando's is the name of that restaurant and it's located at 204 Earls Court just steps from our hotel and Earl's Court underground station in South Kensington. The restaurant is small but has a nice ambiance and it gets really busy for dinner. Try the boneless chicken thighs with a couple of sides will surely satisfy your hunger. If you're in for the bones, the whole chicken platter with 2 large sides or 4 small sides will make 2 people happy. The creamy mash and the peas are my personal favorite sides. They made them just perfect. If you like red wine , try the Cara Viva! It's so smooth and will add more flavor for your taste buds. What else? It will set jour mood just right!",

We had never heard of Nando's before, but after doing some research we realized how globally popular it really was and deservedly so!It was pretty crowded when we visited for dinner because of how busy the area was. There was about a 15 minute wait, but it was worth every second. Once we were informed that a table opened up for us, we were told to order at the cash register and the food would be brought to us.We both ordered their popular Peri Peri chicken with 2 sides, my girlfriend the1/4 and me the 1/2. The bottom line was that this was some of the best roast chicken we had ever had - flavorful, very juicy and leaving us wanting much much more! This quality food definitely did not belong in a fast food restaurant as it tasted so much better! Oh and don't forget the unlimited amount of sauce they allow you to use. There were a variety of flavors that you could use.The sides were also excellent too, as I had the Peri fries and red skin mashed potatoes and my girlfriend had the Portuguese rice and corn on the cob. The fries were like thick cut frites and there was a ton of it on my dish. We're aware that Nando's exists in the states, but we're praying and hoping that they open one up soon near us in New York!",

Place is also great for take away/to go. \u00a0It's best to eat the food that day. \u00a0Thought the chicken was super tender and moist first day then seemed tougher next day (still tasty though).",

You order at the cash register and they bring your food out for you. All the sauces are self-serve.I had the Butterfly Chicken Medium (I should have went a level higher since I love my flavors bolder) and it was quite good. Add a kick of their house sauce for some heat. Their garlic bread was REALLY delicious- one of the better ones I've had. The rice was pretty good and flavorful.A nice variety of people come here to eat so it was quite comfortable. Prices were also pretty good for the amount of food I had.",
